00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,764
18 Americans embarked on a

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,266
journey to one of the most

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,476
remote regions of Africa.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,103
Welcome to<i> Survivor: Gabon,</i>

10
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,064
Earth's last Eden.

11
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,399
The diverse group included

12
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,192
a high school physics teacher,

13
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,402
a world championship video game

14
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,654

>> I am a 2004 gold medalist in

16
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,451

two tribes, Ace and Sugar

connected right off the bat.

20
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,205
>> I don't think it would be

21
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:39,789
appropriate for a photographer

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,248
not to have a model.

23
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,000
Sugar, please.

24
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:42,250
>> Oh!

25
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,377
>> PROBST: The tribes were

26
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,921
called Fang, in red, and, Kota,

27
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,298
wearing yellow.

28
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,174
Go!

29
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,633
They immediately raced for

30
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,177
individual immunity and extra

31
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,385
food.

32
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,346
Marcus has the idol for Kota.

33
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,390
For Fang, GC grabs the idol.

34
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,058
Fang lost the challenge

35
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,268
by a landslide.

36
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,395
Kota wins corn and beans!

37
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,521
From the very beginning, Kota

38
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,398
was a tribe that could do no

39
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:05,607
wrong.

40
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,901
>> Our morale was super-high.

41
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,068
We're all excited.

42
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:09,486
We love our team.

43
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,196
>> PROBST: The yellow tribe

44
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,739
was in perfect harmony.

45
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,323
>> I felt a little yoga would

46
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,284
really get our energy flowing,

47
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,327
the chakras would be all in

48
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,328
time.

49
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,621
>> PROBST: Almost.

50
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,288
>> Ace is kind of getting on my

51

55
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,130
He does not shut up.

56
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,465
>> PROBST: But Kota's problems

57
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,133
seem insignificant compared

58
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,301
to Fang's.

59
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,303
After only six days, the red

60
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,888
tribe was starting to look like

61
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,556
one of the worst tribes in

62
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,058
<i>Survivor</i> history.

63
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,685
>> This tribe is hopeless.

64
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,895
They're idiots.

65
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,979
>> PROBST: They lost an immunity

66
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,481
challenge badly, and voted out

67
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,441
one of their best athletes.

68
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,193
They selected a tribe leader,

69
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,153
GC, and he quit the next day.

70
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,154
>> I didn't want to be a leader.

71
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,447
I'm not going to let y'all force

72
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,198
me to be the leader.

75
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,243
Fang is falling behind.

76
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,369
They lost yet another immunity

77
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,287
challenge, and then finally,

78
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,705
they did something that was

79
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,374
completely out of character.

80
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,334
They made a unified decision.

81
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,794
They unanimously voted out their

82
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,380
oldest and weakest player.

83
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,257
Gillian, the tribe has spoken.

84
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,549
>> Bummer.

85
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,342
>> PROBST: 16 are left.

86
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:24,310
Who will be voted out tonight?

87
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,187
>> Thank God for another night.

88
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,314
>> Hell, yeah, man.

89
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,399
Whatever happens, we made it

90
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,316
another night, you guys.

91
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,317
>> Tribal Council was

92
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,318
a no-brainer.

93
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,736
Gillian, you got to go.

94
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,573
We got rid of a major physical

95
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,991
weak link.

96
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,534
>> Tomorrow is going to be a

97
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,368
new day.

98
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,369

103
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,832
it on.

104
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,500
Ahh! Okay.

have, I still don't believe

109

it's possible.

110

>> The problem is that they're

112
00:02:59,345 --> 00:02:59,470
stupid.

113
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,431
I really shouldn't blame them

114
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,557
for being complete idiots, but

115
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,433
they are.

116
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,517
They don't know it, but,

117
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,770

day.

149
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,316

151
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,028

want to do, but you sure are

175
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,641

00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,310

00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,061
doesn't need a leader.

178
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:53,603
So what's your point?

179
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,854
Are you asking me if I want

180
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,480
to be leader?

181
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,898
Okay, the answer's no.

182
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,982
And, you know, I don't want

183
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,067
to talk about it anymore.

184
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,567

I can ask you something if I

188
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:02,862
want.

189
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,488
>> And I can just ignore you

190
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,489
then.

191
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,908

192
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:07,909

193
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:08,409
together as a team.

194
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,079
We'd have a much better chance

195
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,413
if we were more unified and

196
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,749
thinking of this as a team,

197
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,541
rather than, you know, fighting

198
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,712
amongst each other.

199
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,102
>> Oh, my God!

200
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:34,811
>> Ooh!

201
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,061
>> Whoo!

202
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:35,561
>> A fish.

203
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,437
It's amazing.

204
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,314
>> Yay!

205
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,566
>> Our hero.

206
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,027
>> My alliance right now is

207
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,362
with Marcus, Corinne, and

208
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:44,612
Jacquie.

209
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,697
Beyond that, I think Paloma and

210
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,490
Kelly are really tight.

211
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,450
And Sugar is attached to Ace.

212
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,661
And I definitely think Bob is

213
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,288
woo-able, and can be used as a

214
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,373
swing vote.

215
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,541
So there is always the concern

216
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,500
that the other five might bond

217
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,795
together, but I think the other

218
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,630
five are so all over the place,

219
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,340
that we'll be able to keep the

220
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:04,757
four together.

221
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:07,969
>> It's his way or no way.

222
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,053
>> Like, right now, they're

223
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,096
just, like, he's like the king,

224
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:10,888
and everybody's, like, bowing

225
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,889
down to him.

226
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,182
I just want to gag every time

227
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,142
he opens his mouth.

228
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,560
>> I know.

229
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,064
>> Yeah, I know.

230
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,192
>> I know.

231
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,865
>> For some reason, me and Ace

232
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,283
decided we had some kind of

233
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,075
connection.

234
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,326
I trust Ace.

235
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,996
And I believe that he's going

236
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,122
to take care of me as much as

237
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:36,956
he can.

238
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,541
>> You guys!

239
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,710
>> Tree mail!

240
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,086
>> Okay, ready?

241

"This head-to-head battle

242

>> Bedding!

248
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,684
>> We've got water.

249
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,438
>> Right.

250
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,063
>> I mean, obviously, I'm not

251
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,398
going to say let's throw

252
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:02,982
the challenge, but I'm

253
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,400
saying I'd rather we put out

254
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,235
people that are stronger today,

255
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,612
so we have those people that

256
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,613
are stronger for the immunity

257
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:08,905
challenge.

258
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,697
>> Yeah, exactly.

259
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,615
>> Because I can live without

260
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,741
bedding, but I'd rather not go

261
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,868
to Tribal.

262

everybody's just bowing down to

265
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,623
him.

266
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,042
They think he's the king, but I

267
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,043
can see through it, so I'm not

268
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:22,960
blinded by it.

269
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,045

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,631
same frustration.

00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,904
Kota wins reward.

386
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:37,279
Survivors ready?

387
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,659
Go!

388
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,411
This match looks a little more

389
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,870
uneven with Crystal and Randy

390
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,249
on the very small Paloma.

391
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,293
This could be over quickly.

392
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,086
>> You're done!

393
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:52,378
You're done.

394
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,546
>> PROBST: Randy and Crystal

395
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,922
have Paloma off the post very

396
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,090
fast.

397
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,174
They're dragging her up the

398
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:02,138
hill.

399
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:02,972
>> There you go.

400
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,181
You're done.

401
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,182
>> PROBST: Fang scores!

402
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,642
We're tied, 1-1.

403
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,394
>> Yeah!

404
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,228
Get some!

405
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,354
Come on and get some!

406
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,355
I'm trying to sleep good

407
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:11,814
tonight.

408
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,857
>> PROBST: All right, we are

409
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,233
tied 1-1.

410
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,276
We're back to the original

411
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,403
match-up: Ace and Dan on the

412
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,279
poles.

413
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,238
The attackers are different

414
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,406
this time.

415
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,366
Marcus and Bob attacking for

416
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,451
Kota.

417
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,244
And Crystal and Matty are the

418
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,704
attackers for Fang.

419
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,164
This is a final round.

420
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,999
Playing for reward.

421
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,625
Kota would like to make sure

422
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,877
Fang does not taste victory.

423
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,505
Fang is desperate for a victory.

424
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,299
Survivors ready?

425
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,008
Go!

426
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,635
This is it right here.

427
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,095
>> Come on, Crystal!

428
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,388
>> PROBST: You need to dig deep

429
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,807
like you've never dug before.

430
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,976
Dan holding on tight against

431
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,561
Marcus and Bob.

432
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,187
Ace not budging against Matty

433
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,189
and Crystal.

434
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,151
Which tribe wants it more?

435
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,819
>> Crystal, we need this win!

436
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,904
>> PROBST: Matty has the top

437
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,282
half of Ace off of the post.

438
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,075
Crystal, working on the legs.

439
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,660
Bob and Marcus have Dan off the

440
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,704
post.

441
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,206
Dan hanging on with his last

442
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:10,956
arm.

443
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,209
>> Nice, Crystal!

444
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:13,918
>> PROBST: Crystal and Matty

445
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:14,960
have Ace off the post, and they

446
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,755
are dragging him!

447
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,340
Marcus and Bob starting to make

448
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,300
some progress.

449
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,551
We are neck and neck.

450
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,095
Ace trying to get away.

451
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,514
A big takedown!

452
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,265
This is a war.

453
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,725
Bob and Marcus fighting hard on

454
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:29,975
Dan.

455
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,852
Crystal's starting to drag

456
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,102
Ace again.

457
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,104
Fang getting closer to their

458
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,564
first victory!

459
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,359
Dan fighting them off.

460
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,443
>> Don't give up!

461
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,277
>> PROBST: Ace knocks Crystal

462
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,947
down.

463
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,490
>> Crystal!

464
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:44,990
Do it!

465
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,033
>> I can't hold on much longer!

466
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:46,992
>> PROBST: Dan screaming for

467
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,454
some help.

468
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,706
Matty now pulling Ace.

469
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,042
Who's got more will?

470
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,378
You got to cross the plane.

471
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,712
You got to get him across.

472
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,297
Fang wins reward!

473
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:00,589
(cheering)

474
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,675
>> Yeah!

475
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:02,925
>> Yes!

476
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,345
>> Good job!

477
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,974
>> One, two, three-- Fang!

478
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,767
>> PROBST: Fang,

479
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,893
congratulations.

480
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,936
Crystal, you look very

481
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,062
emotional.

482
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,355
>> We had to go out here and

483
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,731
fight like warriors in order to

484
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,274
get some blankets and some

485
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,317
comfort, but it was worth it.

486
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,360
>> PROBST: Fang, big decision to

487
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:21,569
make.

488
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,320
Who are you going to send from

489
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,114
Kota to go to Exile Island?

490
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,198
>> We're going to go with

491
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,324
someone sweet.

492
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,033
So we're going to pick Sugar.

493
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,535
>> I knew that.

494
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,578
>> PROBST: How'd you know that?

495
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,370
>> I knew that.

496
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,288
I knew that they were going

497
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,414
to pick me 'cause they think

498
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm dumb, but they haven't

499
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:34,665
talked to me yet.

500
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,791
>> PROBST: Well, the bad news

501
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,792
for you, Sugar, you're going

502
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,085
to be away from camp, and as you

503
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,336
know, that's never a good thing.

504
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,628
>> I know.

505
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,170
>> PROBST: The good news is,

506
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,339
waiting for you on Exile, a clue

507
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,632
to the location of a hidden

508
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,508
immunity idol.

509
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,301
Got your stuff?

510
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:45,509
>> Yup.

511
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:50,556
>> PROBST: Map to Exile.

512
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,849
Kota, got nothing for you.

513
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,891
Grab your stuff.

514
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,102
Head back to camp.

515
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,770
All right, Fang, nice job.

516
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,646
Get your reward.

517
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,108
Head on out.

518
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,007
>> Hammock.

519
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,969
(cheering)

520
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,137
>> Nice.

521
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,347
Everybody, nice.

522
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,431
>> Good job, man.

523
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,100
That challenge felt so good.

524
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,810
It felt good for the other

525
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,854
tribe to feel the pain that we

526
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,980
have been feeling to walk away

527
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,441
with your heads down.

528
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,317
>> How fun is winning?

529
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,984
How awesome is it to come back

530
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,444
winning?

531
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,654
>> You held on.

532
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,113
>> The reason I held on so long

533
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,531
'cause I got my energy from

534
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,158
Matty and from you.

535
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,493
Coming back into camp, we were

536
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,244
feeling like a team.

537
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,121
Finally feeling like we're

538
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,539
going to start creating a little

539
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,582
bit of a roll here.

540
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,750
I was losing it and you heard

541
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,042
me yelling.

542
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:00,626
>> I'm all, "Come on, bitch!

543
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,085
Come on, bitch!"

544
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,254
(laughter)

545
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,053
>> No, you guys did awesome.

546
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,429
>> I mean, we had-- we moved

547
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,639
our forces back in perfect

548
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,682
retreat, which was the point.

549
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,474
>> Exactly.

550
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,183
>> But we did take out our

551
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,477
strongest girls, you know?

552
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,853
I mean, it was a great, great

553
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,688
decision.

554
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,772
>> That was such a brilliant

555
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,231
strategy.

556
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,357
>> It's hard when, like...

557
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,400
I mean, their three strongest,

558
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,776
and one of the them was the

559
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,652
girl, it's like...

560
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,238
>> Yeah.

561
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,781
>> No.

562
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,990
Nobody would of.

563
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,574
>> Crystal, which is on their

564
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,076
team, is huge.

565
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,035
Especially compared to me.

566
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,286
Like, I'm the shortest person

567
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,914
alive, so compared to Crystal,

568
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,040
like, I mean, I just had no

569
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:40,791
chance.

570
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,875
It was kind of weird that,

571
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,502
like, Ace decided to put me on

572
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,003
the pole instead of Sugar, but,

573
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:45,587
like with Ace, it's kind of

574
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,172
like it's his way or the

575
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:47,923

577
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,174
instead of Paloma.

578
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,635

579
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,095

582

something, but...

583
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,349
>> Yeah, but what if it wasn't

584
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,977

585

586

>> That's fine.

587
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,855
>> We're short two pillows.

588
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,313
>> Big deal.

589
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,441

590
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,483
>> It's not fine when it's,

591
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,735
like, we still have to catch

592
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,819
fish for her and catch fish for

593
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,237
her tonight, and keep the traps

594
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,072
and do all the other stuff.

595
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,323
It's, like, I don't know, we're

596
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:13,824
just stuck with Paloma.

597
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,700
>> Yeah.

598
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,034
>> It was a bit hard, you know,

599
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,911
watching Paloma just give up.

600
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,664
Yeah, I think her lack of, um...

601
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,041
motivation, let's say, just sort

602
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,126
of sealed what we were all

603
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,461
thinking already.

604
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,128
Sort of crossed and dotted the

605
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,088
"T"s on her contract of death.

606
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:32,926
So whatever.

607
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:50,652
>> "In this garden of Eden,

608
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,988
a difficult choice you'll face.

609
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,032
One choice provides an apple.

610
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,033
One choice provides direction.

611
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,201
Spend your time in idle comfort

612
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,787
or seek idol protection."

613
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,829
Going for the clue.

614
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,455
Getting in that cage and having

615
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,791
comfort, it would have been

616
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,291
nice.

617
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,709
But it would have been really

618
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,920
stupid because I'm pretty sure

619
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,546
since I'm only the second person

620
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,715
sent to Exile Island, that the

621
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,216
idol is still out there.

622
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,300
"Across the lake you see so

623
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,887
well, there lies a sandy crater.

624
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,972
The object hidden in its floor

625
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,015
will surely help you later."

626
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,141
Looks like I got to go through

627
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,976
a jungle.

628
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,105
No problem.

629
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,950
(gasps): Oh, my God!

630
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,784
Oh, my God!

631
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,745
Oh, my God!

632
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,248
Oh!

633
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:48,919
(screams)

634
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,254
This is not my normal thing,

635
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,463
obviously.

636
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,048
I'm not a camper.

637
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,050
I don't like to be dirty.

638
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,723
I think I've gone too far.

639
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,310
This time, I've gone too far.

640
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,188
Yeah... I'm lost.

641
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,190
I did<i> Survivor</i> 'cause I thought

642
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,817
it might help me grow up

643
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,193
a little bit and get a thicker

644
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,029
skin, and get over...

645
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,533
not get over, but deal with...

646
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,576
my father's death-- I can't

647
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,953
even say it.

648
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,872
My father passed away seven

649
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,247
months ago.

650
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,374
I'm trying to, trying to keep

651
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,959
it together because when I stay

652
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,210
in survival mode, then I don't

653
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,628
get like this.

654
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,005
I'm sure I'll be a stronger

655
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,339
person by the end of it all.

656
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,049
Playing this game will help me

657
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,137
at this time in my life.

658
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,432
Oh, thank God!

659
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,685

Oh, my God.

662
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,332
Did I find... the thing?

663
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,416
Or is this a joke?

664

What?

669
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,257
That looks like it could be one

670
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,134

671
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:22,930
Maybe I'll...

672
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,306
start with this one.

I'll tell you this much.

766
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,639
I have, you know, Jacquie,

767
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,765
Marcus, Charlie.

768
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,142
You know, we're all in your

769
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:55,725
book.

770
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,394
As long as, you know, you feel

771
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,520
the same way we do, we're all

772
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,229
in it together.

773
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,021
>> Yeah.

774
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,064
>> And there's five of us.

775
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,274
So it's... we can pick whoever

776
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,066
we want.

777
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,109
We are in the majority.

778
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,152
I think Bob responds really

779
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,237
well to bold, confident moves.

780
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,821
When I was speaking to him,

781
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,698
I had to speak to him like,

782
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,448
"Here's the deal.

783
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,241
These are the four.

784
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:11,700
You're the fifth.

785
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,242
That's all you need to know.

786
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,368
It's the majority.

787
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,369
We're getting rid of this one."

788
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,162
That's it.

789
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,246
And it doesn't really matter

790
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:16,913
'cause we're five.

791
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,040
So lock it down.

792
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:19,499
That's it.

793
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,250
>> Good point.

794
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,293
>> None of us are looking

795
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,460
to take Bob to the end.

796
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:22,961
However, we need him for

797
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,046
numbers, and I think that we can

798
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,505
trust him.

799
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,090
>> Tree mail.

800
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,050
>> "Slip, slide, splash and run.

801
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,385
The stakes are high, but you'll

802
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,928
have some fun.

803
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,763
Who is bright and who is slow?

804
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,140
Know the difference or be the

805
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,141
next to go."

806
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,100
>> Oh, no!

807
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:37,559
>> (gasps): Yay!

808
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,310
>> Yay!

809
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,311
I knew our swimsuits were

810
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:39,561
in there!

811
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,105
>> Yay!

812
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,398
>> I think the next immunity

813
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,317
challenge is the most crucial

814
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,859
one that we've had at this

815
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,194
point.

816
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,236
Their one victory has given

817
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,404
them some hope.

818
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,488
Crushing that hope is going to

819
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,115
send them to another level of

820
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,493
despair.

821
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:06,129
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

822
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,297
We'll now bring in Sugar,

823
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,715
returning from Exile Island.

824
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:08,965
>> Sugar.

825
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,759
>> Hey, babe.

826
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,677
>> Oh!

827
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,221
That was really wrong.

828
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,307
>> I know.

829
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,391
>> PROBST: Don't look at me.

830
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,684
I didn't send you.

831
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,894
It's the game.

832
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:21,937
All right, you guys ready

833
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,979
to get to today's immunity

834
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:23,688
challenge?

835
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,397
>> Yeah.

836
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:24,981
>> PROBST: First things first.

837
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:30,320
I will take it back again.

838
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:30,946
Once again, immunity is back up

839
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,781
for grabs.

840
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,325
For today's challenge, one at a

841
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,785
time, you will launch yourself

842
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,786
down a slippery slide and into

843
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,788
the water.

844
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,040
You'll then swim out to

845
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:42,791
retrieve a covered number tile

846
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,543
and race back.

847
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,127
Once you've collected all six

848
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,546
tiles, the remaining tribe

849
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,548
member will use those numbered

850
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,051
tiles to solve a math puzzle.

851
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,844
The answer will reveal the

852
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,764
combination to a chest.

853
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,848
First tribe to open their

854
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,101
chest and raise their tribe

855
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,437
flag... wins immunity.

856
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,730
Losers, Tribal Council, where

857
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,482
somebody will be going home.

858
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,566
Kota, you have two extra

859
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,276
members.

860
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,361
Who's going to sit out this one?

861
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,362
Paloma and Sugar.

862
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,405
I'll also give you a minute

863
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,197
to strategize.

864
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:18,493
We'll get started.

865
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,786
All right, Bob and Ken are

866
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,205
waiting to solve puzzle.

867
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,415
Everybody else is going down

868
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,374
the slide.

869
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,585
For immunity, survivors ready?

870
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,586
Go!

871
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,629
It's Crystal and Kelly first

872
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:29,838
down.

873
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,465
Kelly does it perfectly.

874
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:36,177
Crystal takes a hard hit.

875
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,512
Both are in the water at the

876
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,763
same time.

877
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,432
Crystal's tall enough she can

878
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,100
actually run to get her first

879
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,435
puzzle piece.

880
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,394
>> Come on, Kelly!

881
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,645
>> PROBST: Kelly coming back.

882
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,314
>> Come on, Crystal!

883
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,189
>> Run!

884
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,232
>> PROBST: Crystal out of the

885
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,775
water first for Fang.

886
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,403
>> Run, Crystal, run!

887
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,196
>> PROBST: Susie on the course.

888
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,324
>> Come on, Kel.

889
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,033
>> PROBST: Fang with a

890
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,534
good-sized lead right off the

891
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,870
bat.

892
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,663
Corinne hits the course.

893
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,417
>> That was awesome!

894
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,877
>> Come on, Susie!

895
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,837
>> PROBST: Susie has the second

896
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,006
piece to this puzzle.

897
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,924
Corinne quickly gets her number.

898
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,468
She's heading back.

899
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,136
Making up a lot of time on

900
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:18,928
Susie.

901
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,430
>> Come on, Sue, faster!

902
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,514
>> You got it!

903
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,015
You got it!

904
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,433
>> PROBST: Fang has lost all of

905
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,477
their lead now.

906
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,145
Charlie on the course for Kota.

907
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,814
>> Yeah, Charlie!

908
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,940
>> PROBST: Kota now has the

909
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:31,149
lead.

910
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,568
>> Yeah, Charlie!

911
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,110
>> PROBST: GC on the course

912
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,529
for Fang.

913
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,698
That's how you do it.

914
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,700
Charlie out of the water,

915
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,701
heading back for Kota.

916
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,745
Kota has three tiles back.

917
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,499
Fang, still with two.

918
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,625
Kota still with a good-sized

919
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,379
lead.

920
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,631
Randy on the course for Fang.

921
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,426
>> Come on, Randy!

922
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,469
>> PROBST: Jacquie out of the

923
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,970
water for Kota.

924
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,891
Two numbers left.

925
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,895
Ace flips over twice.

926
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,106
Randy needs to pick it up.

927
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,942
Fang has lost more time.

928
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,693
Dan on the course for Fang.

929
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,778
Still looking to win that first

930
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,863
immunity challenge.

931
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,782
Ace holding on to Kota's lead.

932
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,032
>> Ace!

933
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:21,950
>> PROBST: Kota has one number

934
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,993
left in the water.

935
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,580
Fang has two more left.

936
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,582
A big launch.

937
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,959
Marcus heading out for that

938
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,962
sixth and final number for Kota.

939
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,630
Dan finally out of the water

940
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,215
for Fang.

941
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,591
Matty's going to have to make

942
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,845
up a lot of time.

943
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,930
Marcus out of the water with

944
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,557
the sixth and final number for

945
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,517
Kota.

946
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,269
It's now up to Bob to solve the

947
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:49,978
puzzle.

948
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:50,854
>> Okay, Bob!

949
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,815
You can do it!

950
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,858
>> PROBST: Matty out of the

951
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,484
water with that sixth and final

952
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,527
number.

953
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,529
>> Go, Ken!

954
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,697
>> PROBST: Ken racing now,

955
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,573
trying to catch up.

956
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,157
Got a physics teacher going

957
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,992
head-to-head with a video game

958
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,034
expert.

959
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,744
You don't need to be a math

960
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,537
major to figure this out.

961
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,955
You just need to be able to

962
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,039
concentrate.

963
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,833
Read it carefully.

964
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,668
Rearrange the numbers.

965
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,878
"The sum of both end values will

966
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,256
equal the sum of the middle two.

967
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,008
The last number is equal to the

968
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,218
second, minus the third, and is

969
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,678
one less than the one before

970
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,431
it."

971
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,474
>> Do it! Do it, then!

972
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:27,974
Try it!

973
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:28,558
>> PROBST: Bob thinks he might

974
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,601
have it.

975
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,643
Make those numbers into a

976
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,436
combination.

977
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,604
If you're right, the chest will

978
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,230
open.

979
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,984
No, he doesn't have it.

980
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:38,818
>> I think I got it.

981
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:44,032
>> PROBST: Ken thinks he has it.

982
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,824
Ken tries it.

983
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,200
He's not right.

984
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,619
Try to look at this puzzle

985
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,077
again.

986
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,245
Maybe you're putting a comma

987
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,663
where it doesn't belong or

988
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:54,626
reading a word wrong.

989
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,295
>> Oh, are these the end values?

990
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,421
>> PROBST: Bob thinks he might

991
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,716
have figured it out suddenly.

992
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,842
>> I think I got it, Jeff.

993
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,219
>> PROBST: Ken thinks he has it

994
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,303
again.

995
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,387
>> I do, too.

996
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,181
>> PROBST: Bob thinks he has it.

997
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,433
Both tribes trying it.

998
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,017
Either one of these guys are

999
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,479
right, immunity for their tribe.

1000
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,731
>> Pull the damn handle, Bob!

1001
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:17,232
>> PROBST: Bob tries it.

1002
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:22,904
He's wrong, once again.

1003
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:30,620
Ken has it right for Fang.

1004
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,080
Fang wins immunity!

1005
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:32,872
(cheers)

1006
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,626
>> We did it!

1007
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,044
>> Oh, my God!

1008
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,463
>> That's simple math.

1009
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,633
>> Fang!

1010
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,133
>> PROBST: Fang,

1011
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,051
congratulations.

1012
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,261
Back-to-back wins.

1013
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,263
This time for immunity.

1014
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,639
This game is changing.

1015
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,266
(applause)

1016
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,768
Kota, date with me tonight at

1017
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:54,644
Tribal Council where the third

1018
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,979
person will be voted out of

1019
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:56,688
this game.

1020
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,063
Grab your stuff.

1021
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,565
Head back to camp.

1022
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,692
I will see you at Tribal.

1023
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,318
Fang, you guys going to miss me

1024
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:02,735
at Tribal Council?

1025
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,487
>> You need to get to know them

1026
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,238
a little bit better.

1027
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:05,947
>> PROBST: Grab your stuff.

1028
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,618
Head back to camp.

1029
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,184
>> But the clues are not

1030
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,060
freaking easy.

1031
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,604
I had to find my way through,

1032
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,021
like, a big desert.

1033
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,023
Saw a spot with this map

1034
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,900
and I kind of read it wrong

1035
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,818
or something.

1036
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,612
I think I played off the fact

1037
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,154
that I won the idol pretty

1038
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,697
well.

1039
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,781
I don't think anybody has

1040
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,617
a clue that I got it.

1041
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,619
I'm not too bad at this.

1042
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,703
I'm a lot better than I

1043
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:57,832
thought, for sure.

1044
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,337
>> So I can hang on to this

1045
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,005
thing for a while, maybe.

1046
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,006
>> Yeah, hang on to it.

1047
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,049
I mean, I'd obviously, not

1048
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,091
bring it to Tribal tonight,

1049
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,468
but I mean, I'd bring it to

1050
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,094
Tribal generally.

1051
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,020
>> I just had a very nice

1052
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,396
conversation in the canoe,

1053
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,190
being told that Sugar has the

1054
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,608
immunity idol.

1055
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,401
And we're going to hopefully

1056
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,070
dominate this game.

1057
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,072
>> Paloma tonight.

1058
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:29,489
>> Paloma's dead.

1059
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,990
>> Yeah, okay.

1060
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,200
>> Um, Kelly's pretty dead after

1061
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:32,950
that.

1062
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:33,743
>> Awesome.

1063
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,994
I'm pretty excited.

1064
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,454
>> Now, we're all prepping for

1065
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,624
the coupe de grace, being

1066
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,043
Tribal Council, and the

1067
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,922
dismissal of little Miss Paloma.

1068
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,852
>> Strategically, I'm, like,

1069
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,854
the animals out in the wilds.

1070
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,690
I just watch.

1071
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,692
Just watch, and then I'm going

1072
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,943
to pounce on someone and eat

1073
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,738
them up.

1074
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,322
Has Ace made an alliance with

1075
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,782
you yet?

1076
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,533
He's made an alliance with

1077
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:13,908
everybody else.

1078
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:14,784
>> He has?

1079
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,451
>> Mm-hmm.

1080
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,869
>> He's not said one word to me.

1081
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:17,286
>> Mm-hmm.

1082
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,162
He's not said one to me 'cause

1083
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:18,579
he doesn't like me.

1084
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,790
I mean, he's trying everything

1085
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,041
he can to get rid of me, like

1086
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:22,625
putting me on the pole instead

1087
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,710
of Sugar.

1088
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,752
Anyway, think about it.

1089
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,795
He doesn't want to get rid of

1090
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,879
Sugar.

1091
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,422
Ace doesn't want to, and Ace

1092
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,382
is pretty much running the game.

1093
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:29,590
>> Hmm.

1094
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,133
>> It's really crazy.

1095
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,009
Just keep your eyes out because

1096
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,469
he's really, really sneaky.

1097
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,887
Like, I'll just say what I need

1098
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,472
to say really fast till I get

1099
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,724
people to think and get their

1100
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,016
brains going and make them,

1101
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,560
like, all crazy and, like,

1102
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,102
thinking.

1103
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,186
Ace might be, you know, strong

1104
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,105
as an ox and I might be as weak

1105
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,816
as a mouse, but we're both

1106
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,024
50/50.

1107
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,484
People want him out because

1108
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,444
he's strong.

1109
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,486
People might want me out because

1110
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,112
we're weak.

1111
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,071
>> He's not running the show,

1112
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:52,822
Paloma.

1113
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,865
>> Well, I mean, not...

1114
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,741
I mean, personally, I don't

1115
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,533
really care.

1116
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:55,992
I can't stand the guy.

1117
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:56,909
>> Well, let me see what I can

1118
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,827
think up.

1119
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,828
That's not happening.

1120
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,705
I really can't stand Ace.

1121
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,373
I'm not sure that that accent is

1122
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:02,832
real.

1123
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,208
I think he's a con artist.

1124
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,501
I would like it see him go home

1125
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,753
sooner rather than later.

1126
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,963
I am afraid if Ace goes with us

1127
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:09,797
to the merge he will be the

1128
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,798
first one to flip because he's

1129
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,799
on the outskirts of our

1130
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,592
alliance.

1131
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,426
So I went on a walk with

1132
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:13,968
Paloma.

1133
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:14,510
>> Yeah?

1134
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,928
She tried me to be in an

1135
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,722
alliance with her.

1136
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,347
And she was like, "Ace is really

1137
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,974
dangerous."

1138
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:21,017
She goes "The only reason why

1139
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,185
Ace made a point to force me to

1140
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,770
go on the post is so that

1141
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,812
everyone could see how bad I

1142
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,021
was."

1143
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,022
She's like, "Everyone knew

1144
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,065
who's..."

1145
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:27,690
>> I think that could be partly

1146
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,649
true.

1147
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,400
>> It's 100% true.

1148
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:29,984
Afterwards...

1149
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,027
I know this because afterwards

1150
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,153
Ace was like, "Did you see how

1151
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:32,862
good a job..."

1152
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,571
>> Sugar wants him.

1153
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:33,988
>> What, are you...

1154
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:34,864
>> And she can do it for two

1155
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,573
seconds, like this.

1156
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,574
>> Not even.

1157
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,450
It's a problem.

1158
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,367
Ace needs to get out of here

1159
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,327
before the merge because we

1160
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,203
can't have that.

1161
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,163
>> You're smart at this game.

1162
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,790
There definitely is a short-term

1163
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,373
benefit to getting rid of our

1164
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,876
weakest players because then we

1165
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,795
can trounce, you know, the other

1166
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:49,378
team and not have to vote off

1167
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,713
other people.

1168
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,465
But Ace is the biggest concern

1169
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,883
because Ace has been playing

1170
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:54,967
Sugar like a pawn.

1171
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,019
>> "I'm taking her to the end

1172
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:05,812
because she's easy.

1173
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,188
She follows what I say, like..."

1174
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,022
>> They're going to pull out

1175
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,816
all the stops at the end.

1176
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,358
>> Getting rid of Paloma,

1177
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,568
whatever, that can be done

1178
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:12,777
later.

1179
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,319
You want to get rid of Ace

1180
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,278
earlier before he gains

1181
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,364
momentum before we merge.

1182
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,698
That's more important.

1183
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,158
I don't know. It's hard to say.

1184
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,493
I dislike so many people on

1185
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,869
this damn tribe that it's like,

1186
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,204
it's a toss-up.

1187
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:39,887
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

1188
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,097
is a torch.

1189
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,515
Grab a torch, approach a flame,

1190
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,891
dip it in and get fire.

1191
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,475
This is part of the ritual of

1192
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,769
Tribal Council because in this

1193
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,897
game, fire represents your life.

1194
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,777
As long as you have fire, you

1195
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,653
are still in the game.

1196
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,363
When your fire is gone, so are

1197
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,490
you.

1198
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,495
So, finally, we get a chance to

1199
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,663
talk.

1200
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,248
So, Corinne, first Tribal

1201
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,291
Council, what do you base the

1202
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,083
vote on?

1203
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,126
>> Everybody has their own

1204
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,669
opinion of who should be voted

1205
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,420
out, but the idea is that you

1206
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,422
want one opinion together, so

1207
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,132
that you have as little

1208
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:16,757
dissension among the group as

1209
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,467
possible.

1210
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,719
>> PROBST: Ace, that seems

1211
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,388
incredibly pie-in-the-sky.

1212
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,306
"Let's come to one group

1213
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,516
consensus on who we're going to

1214
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:25,766
vote out?"

1215
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,768
>> I think this early in the

1216
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,394
game, the most important thing

1217
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,479
is what strengthens the tribe

1218
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,481
and makes us stronger for

1219
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,400
challenges.

1220
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,443
>> PROBST: Sugar, let's talk

1221
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,612
about Exile Island.

1222
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,404
That's a long time to be alone

1223
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,573
this early in the game.

1224
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,699
What do you draw on?

1225
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,784
>> Well, um...

1226
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,786
I thought about my dad.

1227
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,580
Damn it.

1228
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,124
Just because I lost my dad

1229
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,500
recently, and...

1230
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,502
And....

1231
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,464
>> PROBST: It's got to be tough.

1232
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,717
>> I missed everyone.

1233
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,093
>> Marcus, there are two ways

1234
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,386
to play in regards to the idol.

1235
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,722
One is "Don't try to flush it

1236
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,723
out 'cause I don't have it."

1237
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,349
The other is, "I got it."

1238
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,475
>> You're absolutely right.

1239
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,560
I mean, I think Sugar's

1240
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,478
choosing, if she does have it,

1241
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,980
to let her outside reflect

1242
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,981
something completely different

1243
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,441
than the insides, and, you

1244
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,651
know, if that's the case, more

1245
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:16,984
power to her.

1246
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,069
It's probably the way I would

1247
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:18,444
play it myself.

1248
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:18,986
>> PROBST: When you got with

1249
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,404
this group, who jumped out at

1250
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,616
you you as, wow, interesting.

1251
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,618
>> Um, I think our tribe

1252
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,452
actually has a lot of those

1253
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,453
people, but, I mean, Ace was a

1254
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,538
really interesting guy from the

1255
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,540
start, and he and I seem to work

1256
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,667
well together and have a lot of

1257
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,085
similar ideas.

1258
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:34,710
>> PROBST: Paloma, did Ace stand

1259
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,461
out to you as having a big

1260
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,046
personality?

1261
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:37,505
>> Yeah, definitely.

1262
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,465
Ace is, like, the head honcho at

1263
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,175
our campsite.

1264
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:41,801
>> PROBST: How do you feel about

1265
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,636
that, him being the big guy?

1266
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,762
>> I mean, like, he can be the

1267
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,972
big guy all he wants.

1268
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,848
I really could care less.

1269
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,350
But, I mean, as far as I'm

1270
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,685
concerned, I'm not even going to

1271
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,352
go there.

1272
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:51,978
>> PROBST: You're not even going

1273
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:52,770
to go where?

1274
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,730
>> Like, do the whole, like,

1275
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,482
"Ace is my hero" type thing,

1276
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:56,691
like...

1277
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,484
>> PROBST: So, Ace is clearly

1278
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,485
not your hero.

1279
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,362
>> No, not at all.

1280
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,655
>> PROBST: Ace, does that

1281
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,406
surprise you to hear that?

1282
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,574
>> Not particularly.

1283
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,451
I think we have the capacity to

1284
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,828
rub each other the wrong way.

1285
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,620
>> PROBST: Kelly, do you think

1286
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,789
Ace is an asset to your tribe?

1287
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,791
>> Um, in some cases, because

1288
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,001
he's almost condescending in a

1289
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:15,543
way.

1290
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,419
>> PROBST: How is condescending

1291
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,254
a good thing?

1292
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,422
>> It's not a good thing at all

1293
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,381
sometimes.

1294
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,632
Um, say, we're cooking rice or

1295
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,509
something, he'll be like, "Oh,

1296
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,135
I thought we were going to make

1297
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:24,719
water."

1298
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,720
Like, if somebody wants to make

1299
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,304
rice, let us make rice.

1300
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,806
We don't necessarily need water

1301
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,598
right now.

1302
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,558
>> PROBST: Ace, concerned at all

1303
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,852
that you have two people that

1304
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,436
are coming up saying, "By the

1305
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,604
way, I got two votes and..."

1306
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,939
>> Of course, you know.

1307
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,024
You can never walk into Tribal

1308
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,734
Council without being scared.

1309
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,735
>> He doesn't have his bag with

1310
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,069
him, so he can't be that

1311
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:42,820
worried.

1312
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,863
>> There's nothing I really

1313
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,323
wanted to take from camp.

1314
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:46,907
>> Think you guys would have

1315
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,075
been maybe brother-sister in

1316
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:48,784
another life?

1317
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,245
>> Maybe, in another world,

1318
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:53,456
1,000 years from now, when I'm

1319
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,582
dead.

1320
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,669
>> PROBST: Wow.

1321
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,837
All right, Marcus, you have an

1322
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,881
immunity idol around your neck.

1323
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,758
It is only good at tonight's

1324
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,633
Tribal Council.

1325
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,634
You can, obviously, assign it

1326
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,136
to somebody if you want or make

1327
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:07,762
sure are you safe and keep it.

1328
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,096
>> I think I'm going to hang on

1329
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:09,680
to it this time.

1330
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,139
>> PROBST: All right.

1331
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,766
Tonight, Marcus is safe.

1332
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,309
Everybody else is fair game.

1333
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:13,768
It is time to vote.

1334
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,603
Kelly, you're up.

1335
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,332
>> This is pretty much

1336
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,459
self-explanatory.

1337
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,180
>> Unfortunately, you know

1338
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,890
exactly why you're leaving.

1339
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,891
It's for the strength of the

1340
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,475
tribe.

1341
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,602
Best of luck.

1342
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,700
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1343
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,828
votes.

1344
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,713
>> If anybody has the hidden

1345
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,965
immunity idol and you want to

1346
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,591
play it, now would be the time

1347
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,636
to do so.

1348
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:30,928
Okay.

1349
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,346
Once the votes are read, the

1350
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:32,930
decision is final.

1351
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:33,973
The person voted out will be

1352
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:34,974
asked to leave the Tribal

1353
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,225
Council area immediately.

1354
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,770
I'll read the votes.

1355
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,315
First vote: Paloma.

1356
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,403
Ace.

1357
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,781
One vote Paloma; one vote Ace.

1358
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,908
Ace.

1359
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,743
Two votes Ace; one vote Paloma.

1360
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,706
Paloma.

1361
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,374
We're tied: two votes Paloma;

1362
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:04,170
two votes Ace.

1363
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:04,670
Paloma.

1364
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,713
Three votes Paloma;

1365
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,091
two votes Ace.

1366
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,012
Paloma.

1367
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:13,596
That's four votes Paloma;

1368
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,723
two votes Ace.

1369
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,977
Third person voted out of

1370
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,644
<i>Survivor: Gabon:</i> Paloma.

1371
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,104
That's five.

1372
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:22,688
That's enough.

1373
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,857
You need to bring me your torch.

1374
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,825
>> Paloma, the tribe has spoken.

1375
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,258
Well, the truth is, you've lost

1376
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,718
back-to-back challenges,

1377
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,553
and now your first tribe member.

1378
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,931
Fang clearly has the momentum.

1379
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,015
Question is, can you get it

1380
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:58,766
back?

1381
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,600
Grab your torches.

1382
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,392
Head back to camp.

1383
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,394
Good night.

1395
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,960
are not with me.

1396
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:26,835
>> PROBST: A tribe divided...

1397
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,462
>> The tightest three is right

1398
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:29,255
here.

1399
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:29,797
>> PROBST: Divides again.

1400
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,966
Today, you're going on to rank

1401
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,801
your tribe from top to bottom.

1402
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,844
And the game is turned upside

1403
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:36,595
down.

1404
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,973
>> This is not looking too good

1405
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,100
for a pimp.

1406
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,480
>> So, I got voted off.

1407
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:48,107
Um, first person on my tribe to

1408
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:48,983
go.

1409
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,150
These past nine days in Gabon

1410
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,360
have been amazing.

1411
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,778
Definitely been an experience,

1412
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,030
something I've never ever done

1413
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:55,781
before.

1414
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,824
Good luck to the whole Kota

1415
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,241
tribe.

1416
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:57,825
I hope you guys do awesome.

1417
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,702
But definitely, let's just put

1418
00:42:59,785 --> 00:42:59,994
it this way:

1419
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,912
If Ace wins a million dollars,

1420
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,038
I will probably never watch

1421
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,124
