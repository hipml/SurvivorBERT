JEFF PROBST:
16 Americans forced to
abandon ship

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,091
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China sea...</i>

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,261
<i>Marooned for 39 days,</i>
<i>they must work together</i>

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:16,266
<i>to build shelter, find food</i>
<i>and survive the island</i>

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,812
<i>but, ultimately,</i>
<i>it is everyone for themselves.</i>

6
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:21,855
Every third night

7
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>they will hike</i>
<i>deep into the jungle</i>

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the Tribal Council</i>

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>where they must vote</i>
<i>one of their own</i>

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,487
<i>off the island.</i>

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,073
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>only one will remain,</i>

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,242
<i>and will leave the island</i>
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,370
(<i> primal call echoing</i> )

14
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,791
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor...

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,501
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

16
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,336
RAMONA:
<i>It was the worst night</i>

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,337
I've ever slept.

18
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,339
Gretchen decided

19
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,966
<i>she wouldn't sleep</i>
<i>one more night</i>

20
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,176
<i>in their poorly constructed</i>
<i>shelter.</i>

21
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,595
I don't want to sleep
in that anymore.

22
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,596
I don't want to
be antisocial

23
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,597
but I'm going

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,140
<i>in the woods.</i>

25
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,349
JEFF:
<i>Ramona felt like an outcast</i>

26
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,269
<i>and wanted to redeem herself.</i>

27
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,479
Want to play rough, huh?

28
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,981
JENNA:
<i>She's trying,</i>
<i>but I think maybe it is</i>

29
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,816
a little too little too late.

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,695
JEFF:
<i>At Tagi tribe, Sue continued</i>
<i>her quest to find more food...</i>

31
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,198
Tapioca. Tapioca's supposed
to have red lines and...

32
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,949
Got to find the tapioca.

33
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,035
<i>While Sean worked</i>
<i>on other island necessities.</i>

34
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,620
SEAN:
<i>I had this vision.</i>

35
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,330
I thought I'd build myself
a bowling alley

36
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,790
right about here.

37
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,124
SUSAN:
<i>Sean sits there for five hours</i>

38
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,626
<i>and builds his bowling alley.</i>

39
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,503
I'm tired of feeding people
that don't do anything.

40
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,671
My parents would be so proud.

41
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,133
JEFF:
<i>A cunning plan was hatched</i>
<i>by Sue, Kelly and Rich.</i>

42
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,218
RICH:
<i>So, the, um...</i>

43
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,178
alliances have begun.

44
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,221
The whole point
of forming an alliance is so

45
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,515
we're all going to vote
the same way.

46
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,141
JEFF:
<i>Tagi was on a roll.</i>

47
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,184
<i>They won</i>
<i>the reward challenge...</i>

48
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,185
Go get it.

49
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,186
<i>And, then...</i>

50
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,188
<i>the Immunity Challenge.</i>

51
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,189
(<i> cheering</i> )

52
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,358
<i>So, a distraught Pagong tribe</i>

53
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,401
<i>had to return</i>
<i>to Tribal Council.</i>

54
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,361
GERVASE:
<i>The most difficult thing for me</i>

55
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,363
was to vote somebody off.

56
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,447
JEFF:
<i>And even though Ramona</i>

57
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,282
<i>had been working</i>
<i>harder than ever,</i>

58
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,493
<i>she was still voted off.</i>

59
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,995
Last vote: Ramona.

60
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,747
The tribe
has spoken.

61
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>12 people left.</i>

62
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,211

COLLEEN:

<i>since we've been here today.</i>

68
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,454
Everybody's a little bit
on edge.

69
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,414
<i>Everybody's</i>
<i>a little vulnerable today.</i>

70

(<i> insects buzzing</i> )

71
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,460
JOEL:
<i>I think today</i>
<i>we're just a little bit down</i>

72
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,503
<i>because another person's gone,</i>
<i>of course,</i>

73
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,464
and we can see
that the group's getting

74
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,798
a little bit smaller.

75
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,508
Even if it's
only two people smaller,

76
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,761
<i>it's still getting</i>
<i>a little bit smaller</i>

77
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,639
<i>and, uh, and we're starting</i>
<i>to see that a little bit.</i>

78
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,307
JENNA:
<i>For some reason,</i>

79
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,476
<i>the last two to three days</i>
<i>we've just been really down.</i>

80
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,479
I think it's got a lot to do
with just, uh,

81
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,897
we lost two in a row.

82
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,149
We lost a member of the group
and one of...

83
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,360
who I consider
one of our male leaders, Greg,

84
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,070
was really feeling terrible.

85
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,947
<i>He's got an ear infection.</i>

86
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,114
<i>He's really sick.</i>

87
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,871
GRETCHEN:
<i>I think the camp looks trashy.</i>

88
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,498
<i>I think stuff's</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

89
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,499
<i>I think the flag should be up.</i>

90
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,126
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>there's a lot we could do</i>

91
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,212
<i>to make</i>
<i>this camp look really nice.</i>

92
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,505
I mean, something's going
to have to change.

93
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,506
Something's going to have
to happen

94
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,884
<i>to make everybody decide</i>
<i>to pitch in.</i>

95
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,320
Welcome to the big top,
ladies and gentlemen.

96
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,738
RUDY:
<i>That is the parachute</i>

97
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,365
<i>that they dropped</i>
<i>the cargo with the other day</i>

98
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,826
<i>that, uh,</i>
<i>contained some goodies</i>

99
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,370
and, uh, right now, they want

100
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,622
to hang the parachute up
for shade.

101
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:07,390
KELLY:
<i>Me, personally,</i>
<i>I was a little irritated</i>

102
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,892
with, um, Sean and Dirk's effort
around camp.

103
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,893
I mean,

104
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,186
<i>they try to go fishing</i>

105
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,438
<i>when they know they're</i>
<i>not going to catch anything</i>

106
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,565
<i>and I think, personally,</i>
<i>it's just so they can say,</i>

107
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,151
<i>"Hey, well, we did</i> something."

108
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,569
Kelly thinks that failure
to catch fish is failure to try.

109
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,572
You know, I think she's equating
those two, which is not true.

110
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,324
Right now we
could be working...

111
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,368
driving through
rush hour traffic.

112
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,411
Yep.

113
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:28,995
Fighting bills

114
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,580
and trying
to get dates.

115
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,874
Instead we're just chilling
on the South China sea.

116
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,585
SEAN:
<i>The fish are not biting</i>
<i>hooks out here for some reason.</i>

117
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,837
Either we got the wrong bait, or
we're going at the wrong time.

118
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,630
Fishing with a hook, I think,
is useless.

119
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,884
<i>They put about 25 hours in</i>

120
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,803
<i>and not a bite.</i>

121
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,265
That's a big enough hint for me
not to go fishing with a hook.

122
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,641
You guys getting
anything?

123
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,434
SEAN:
Not even a nibble.

124
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,103
It's our
day off, brother.

125
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,106
SUSAN:
<i>I'm just irritated</i>
<i>with Sean and Dirk</i>

126
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,648
going out and wasting
three days

127
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,692
in the daylight fishing.

128
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,820
<i>And I let them know, too.</i>

129
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,739
During the day, you should
go out in the woods

130
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,782
looking for tapioca

131
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,241
and fish at night.

132
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,117
You guys wasted

133
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,952
three days fishing
during the day.

134
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,288
DIRK:
I don't think
it was a waste.

135
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:12,663
Well, did you catch
anything?

136
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,456
No, ma'am.

137
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,625
Okay.

138
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,837
It was a waste of time then.

139
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,801
SEAN:
<i>It's expected to get on</i>
<i>each other's nerves.</i>

140
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,427
<i>Maybe everyone's</i>
<i>on my nerves, too,</i>

141
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,470
<i>but I just</i>
<i>don't really act on it.</i>

142
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,763
<i>I just wanted to be happy--</i>

143
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:32,141
have a nice life here
and that's it.

144
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,686
KELLY:
<i>It's been the people who really</i>
<i>work and contribute to camp</i>

145
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,480
versus the people
who are lazy

146
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,148
<i>and don't really do anything</i>

147
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,818
<i>to contribute to the camp.</i>

148
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,444
The second I stop having fun

149
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,363
I'll vote myself off the island.

150
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,989
<i>I came here</i>
<i>to have a great time,</i>

151
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,990
<i>grow in my faith</i>

152
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,117
<i>with the Lord</i>

153
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,660
<i>and that's the most important</i>
<i>thing to me.</i>

154
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:55,331
RUDY:
<i>It's funny to me that a guy</i>
<i>would read the Bible out here.</i>

155
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,000
The only reason
I'd bring a Bible is if...

156
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,002
I mean, I'm religious too...

157
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,754
if I needed toilet paper.

158
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,690
Come on over, guys.

159
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,694
I bring news
of tomorrow's challenge.

160
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,821
Right here.

161
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,864
"First Annual

162
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,366
"Weapons Target
Shooting Classic.

163
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,993
The battle in Borneo."

164
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,036
Now, it's
a reward challenge,

165
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,789
so you'll be competing
against the other tribe

166
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,500
for something I have
a feeling you
all want-- food.

167
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,751
So here's
the deal.

168
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,045
It'll be three rounds.

169
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,007
First round is
a blowgun.

170
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,425
Five darts.

171
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,012
Second round--
a mighty slingshot

172
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,389
and the third round,
spear tossing.

173
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,433
So you'll pick one person
for each event.

174
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,893
So only three people
will participate.

175
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,395
And I'm coming to bring these
so you can practice.

176
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,147
I love it.

177
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,780
SEAN:
<i>We had a little visit</i>

178
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,699
<i>from Jeff, our host, today,</i>

179
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,618
and he came by and told us
that tomorrow's going

180
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,744
to be a competition--
a reward challenge.

181
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,747
<i>So we've been practicing</i>
<i>all day at that.</i>

182
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,832
(<i> laughing</i> )

183
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,792
(<i> cheering</i> )

184
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,003
Right in the coconut.

185
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,299
That wasn't too bad.

186
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,926
<i>Turns out that I'm pretty good</i>

187
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,761
with the blowgun.
And I never really...

188
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,720
never shot a blowgun before
in my life.

189
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,602
Dead on. Good.

190
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,270
Turns out Rich is
an expert marksman.

191
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,605
Something
we didn't know about him

192
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,606
<i>until today, so, uh...</i>

193
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,607
<i>He has excellent aim</i>

194
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,275
<i>when it comes to a slingshot.</i>

195
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,485
No worries.

196
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,407
Yeah, I think he's
slingshot boy.

197
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,825
And Sue throws that spear

198
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,453
much better than any
of the guys in our tribe.

199
00:08:57,536 --> 00:09:00,414
<i>She's a wild woman</i>
<i>with the spear.</i>

200
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,755
I always wanted to kill a pig
with a javelin... with a spear.

201
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,174
And I was kind of hoping
that I'd be good at nothing

202
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,133
so that I could just,
like, hang back

203
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,635
and let the pressure go
on somebody else.

204
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,721
<i>Turns out I throw</i>
<i>the javelin the best.</i>

205
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,647
<i>I'm thinking the other team's</i>
<i>going to have a guy</i>

206
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,982
<i>throwing the spear.</i>

207
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,858
So if there is,
there's a good chance

208
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,902
that I can dog some guy
on national TV.

209
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,030
Cool.

210
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,782
No matter who
they put up,
you got it.

211
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,866
SUE:
<i>Even if we lost</i>

212
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,661
and I at least dogged the guy
in the spear throwing,

213
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,704
they'd be happy.

214
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,803
GERVASE:
Next up, out of Green Bay,

215
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,972
weighing in at 2...
excuse me,

216
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,890
he lost 20 pounds. 180.

217
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:04,061
Big country
all-American,

218
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,855
the world's strongest man!

219
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,078
(<i> quacking</i> )

220
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,707
I never really threw
a spear in my life.

221
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,417
Except, you know...
anything serious.

222
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,754
<i>It's kind of hard</i>
<i>to keep it straight.</i>

223
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,883
<i>That's a good distance,</i>

224
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,218
<i>especially a little thing</i>
<i>like this,</i>

225
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,013
<i>and you don't know if you can</i>
<i>take a running start</i>

226
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,599
<i>or how you should do it,</i>
<i>or what the thing is, so</i>

227
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,934
this looks like it's going to be
our weakest event for sure.

228
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,063
<i>Because the other girls have</i>
<i>the blowguns down really well.</i>

229
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,776
<i>The slingshot looks good.</i>

230
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,738
<i>So it would be nice</i>
<i>to win it today.</i>

231
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,408
A lot of these reward challenges
we haven't really been after,

232
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,703
<i>but I think we're all really</i>
<i>determined for this one.</i>

233
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,080
<i>Looks good.</i>

234
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,331
(<i> cheering</i> )

235
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,727
Welcome to the First Annual
<i>Survivor</i> Weapons Challenge,

236
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,978
otherwise known
as The Battle in Borneo.

237
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,232
It's three rounds--
first round is blow darts.

238
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,276
You guys have selected
your blow dart shooters?

239
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,070
All right,
you guys'll have ten darts.

240
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,780
Go ahead
and take your shot here.

241
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,282
Tagi, over here;
Pagong over here to watch.

242
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,951
Any of the fruit you
hit goes into a basket

243
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,494
that we carry over

244
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:43,953
to the next round.

245
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,501
Chinese melon!

246
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,255
Yeah!

247
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,256
Yeah!

248
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,966
JEFF:
Last shot.

249
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,968
Good round, guys.

250
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,844
Head over
to the slingshot area.

251
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,638
I'll collect your fruit.

252
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,974
Hey, good
work, buddy.

253
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,017
JEFF:
<i>All right, it's a time trial.</i>

254
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,270
Let's have the two slingshotters
come up.

255
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,479
Come on, Gretchen!

256
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,939
Come on, baby,
come on, now!

257
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,023
JEFF:
<i>Here are the rules</i>
<i>for this round:</i>

258
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,317
<i>If you knock the fruit off,</i>

259
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,362
<i>if you break the vase</i>

260
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>or if you embed a rock</i>
<i>in the fruit</i>

261
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,490
<i>it goes into the fruit basket.</i>

262
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,908
<i>You have two minutes</i>

263
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,994
<i>to hit as many of the items</i>
<i>as you can.</i>

264
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,667
(<i> cheering</i> )

265
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,170
Yeah!

266
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,887
JEFF:
All right,
round three...

267
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,847
spear throwing,

268
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,849
and this is where
it gets very interesting.

269
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,976
This is
a winner-take-all event.

270
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,645
The single spear
that is closest

271
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,397
to the bull's-eye
when it's over

272
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,400
gets the basket
of fruit

273
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,778
and a very special food source--
a mystery food source.

274
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,197
Who are your two spear throwers?

275
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,532
Step up, mate.

276
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,826
This box is
for shooters only.

277
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,703
You each get
three tosses.

278
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,996
Susan, you're up.

279
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,882
Nice shot!

280
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,884
Come on, Joel,
you can do it.

281
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,261
Come on, Joel.

282
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,399
Nice, Joel!)

283
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,068
Good job!

284
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,069
Good job!

285
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,489
This is our closest right now.
Pagong.

286
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,917
Nice shot!

Those are even right now.

289

Come on, Joel.

Nice!

We want fruit!

293
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,156
New mark to beat.

294
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,786
Come on, Sue.

295
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,996
JEFF:
Last shot, Susan.
Got to get inside that mark.

296
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,514
Nice!

Victory for Pagong.

299
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,771

Yeah,<i> that's</i> going to happen.

This is so awesome;
we got chickens.

<i>I don't know what brought</i>
<i>us down, but it seems like</i>

322
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,083
winning that challenge just
brought everybody right back up.

323
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,836
<i>I can't speak</i>
<i>for the rest of the tribe,</i>

324
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,213
<i>but I really wanted to win</i>
<i>'cause it was food.</i>

325
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,757
<i>I wanted to win that</i>

326
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,218
<i>more than any</i>
<i>of the other rewards thus far.</i>

327
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,679
Unexpectedly, we came back
with three live chickens

328
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,263
which was absolutely wonderful.

329
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,391

JENNA:
Aw, Gretchen!

333
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,360
You're so mean.

334
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,611
Mean, my ass.

335
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,780
<i>Well, we're going to see</i>
<i>if they produce any eggs,</i>

336
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,156
<i>but I'm really thinking</i>
<i>that we're going to wait</i>

337
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,075
<i>every other day</i>
<i>and eat a chicken.</i>

338
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,576
GRETCHEN:
<i>They're not going</i>
<i>to be around long.</i>

339
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,203
Everybody's waiting
for them to lay eggs

340
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,747
but I think
they're under a lot of stress

341
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,624
and there's three of them
in that box

342
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,876
and so they have
a very short time to produce

343
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,294
before they're slaughtered.

344
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,796
You could make
a big omelet.

345
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,465
That or we could just make
fried rice with it.

346
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,758
Oh, chicken fried rice?

347
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,926
Chicken fried rice.

348
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,386
Oh, gross! Oh, my God!

349
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,347
JENNA:
Sorry, Breakfast,
Lunch and Dinner.

350
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:01,353
GERVASE:
<i>The fruit and the chickens</i>
<i>was just so huge</i>

351
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,439
to us, really, I mean...

352
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,567
I think that's the biggest
reward so far to date.

353
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,193
Fresh fruit.

354
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,286
Ooh!

355
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,454
(<i> laughing</i> )

356
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,788
(<i> squeals</i> )

357
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,498
(<i> laughing</i> )

358
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,917
GERVASE:
<i>I think we were down</i>
<i>just because we lost.</i>

359
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,253
<i>I mean, no matter how</i>
<i>you look at it, losing hurts</i>

360
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,130
<i>and we had to vote</i>
<i>somebody off.</i>

361
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,300
So we just had to get out
of that, and then, when we won

362
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,177
<i>the reward challenge, that was</i>
<i>our momentum right there.</i>

363
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,779
SUSAN:
<i>As far as losing</i>
<i>the challenge today,</i>

364
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,114
I was a little irritated.

365
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,699
<i>Here's my dream come true.</i>

366
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,951
<i>I can stomp a guy</i>
<i>on national television</i>

367
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,328
<i>and I miss by two inches.</i>

368
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,079
<i>It was a bummer, but then</i>

369
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,665
when they pulled the chickens
out, I started laughing.

370
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,209
<i>Cutting off a chicken's head?</i>

371
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,378
<i>No, it's not what I would want</i>
<i>to do for food.</i>

372
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,797
I can live without the chicken
right now.

373
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,881
So that was all right.

374
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,300
The other team won some
live chickens with some eggs.

375
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,552
So we came back here

376
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,638
<i>and I went spearfishing</i>
<i>and got us a nice eel.</i>

377
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,723
<i>That's the first eel.</i>

378
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,433
If I'd seen others,
I'd have gotten others.

379
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,146
SUSAN:
Oh, wow.

380
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,398
It's all beautiful meat,
the whole thing.

381
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,233
Nice job, Rich.

382
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,360
Is that pretty?

383
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,820
It's so pretty.

384
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,237
That's a lot of meat, there.

385
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,363
It's all meat.

386
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,198
Beats the hell
out of chicken.

387
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,826
KELLY:
<i>I'd rather eat some eel</i>
<i>than some chicken.</i>

388
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,203
<i>At least we eat stuff</i>
<i>that we go out and catch</i>

389
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,498
and look for ourselves, and
we don't have it handed to us.

390
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,819
It might be a little overcooked.

391
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,073
It's meat.

392
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,408
It's meat.

393
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,451
RICHARD:
Grab a piece.

394
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,412
SUSAN:
Grab a piece and see
if you can rip it apart.

395
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,914
That's what it's
going to take.

396
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,333
RICHARD:
It's cartilaginous,
so chew on it.

397
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,761
SEAN:
<i>The eel was pretty horrible.</i>

398
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,431
Uh, it wasn't any good
whatsoever.

399
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,766
KELLY:
<i>We thought it was</i>
<i>just going to be</i>

400
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,561
you know, big, fat steaks
of meat, but it really wasn't.

401
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,813
RUDY:
<i>I wouldn't go</i>
<i>after eel again</i>

402
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,273
<i>if I had a choice--</i>
<i>I would have rather had</i>

403
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,942
chicken without a doubt.

404
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,737
Wow. That's something.

405
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,666
GRETCHEN:
<i>My feelings</i>

406
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,252
<i>on who the leader is</i>
<i>has always been Greg.</i>

407
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,087
He's just really good at it.

408
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,673
I may be slipping into some sort
of leadership position.

409
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,674
I'm attempting to avoid it.

410
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,093
I don't want to be
the leader of anything.

411
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,305
<i>I go play by myself, help out</i>
<i>the tribe as much as I can</i>

412
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,516
<i>and try and recharge</i>
<i>my batteries</i>

413
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,478
<i>so I can be there fully</i>
<i>with them.</i>

414
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,146
He's really good
at living in the woods, too.

415
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,814
<i>I think, out of everybody here,</i>

416
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,900
<i>Greg's the most comfortable</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

417
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,615
GREG:
<i>My psychological comfort</i>
<i>does not come</i>

418
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,658
<i>from sleeping with the group</i>
<i>in a hut.</i>

419
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,326
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>they kind of make me nervous,</i>

420
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,828
<i>'cause there are</i>
<i>a lot of people doing</i>

421
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,830
<i>a lot of different things</i>

422
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,499
<i>and it's a lot of energy</i>
<i>in a very small space</i>

423
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,460
<i>while I'm trying to clear</i>
<i>my head of energy.</i>

424
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,461
Sleeping in the forest
is comfortable

425
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,630
<i>for me.</i>

426
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,173
I'm making
a little sleeping pad.

427
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,968
Sleeping pad, sleeping bag--
depending on how big it gets.

428
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,970
<i>I just used some bedding</i>
<i>of debris</i>

429
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,347
<i>or whatever I can find--</i>
<i>palm or the leaves</i>

430
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,391
<i>that are around--</i>
<i>and pile up a bunch of debris.</i>

431
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,810
It's all a nesting instinct.

432
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,687
As with everything,
make yourself a nest.

433
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,564
<i>I nest like a mama bird.</i>

434
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,318
<i>Papa bird-- more like</i>
<i>a papa bird than a mama bird.</i>

435
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,528
A single...
like a bachelor bird, I guess.

436
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,200
<i>Colleen has joined me</i>
<i>in the forest to sleep.</i>

437
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:28,370
<i>She apparently finds it</i>
<i>more comfortable, as well.</i>

438
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,664
I mean, they go off a lot,
seems like together.

439
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,749
<i>Like last night, for example,</i>

440
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,710
<i>while everybody</i>
<i>was going to bed,</i>

441
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,087
<i>they got out,</i>
<i>and nobody saw them</i>

442
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,715
<i>till just this morning</i>
<i>sometime.</i>

443
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,596
JENNA:
<i>I noticed they seem</i>
<i>to be spending their nights</i>

444
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,557
<i>out under the stars</i>
<i>and cuddling up.</i>

445
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,726
I think it's stepped up
a notch--

446
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,186
maybe a little romance going on.

447
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,689
Um, when we go off,
it's all about sex.

448
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,481
It's all that's happening.

449
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,026
Um...

450
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,028
<i>it's a really passionate</i>
<i>affair right now.</i>

451
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,738
Things are going great.

452
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,739
(<i> laughing</i> )

453
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,199
The question was asked before

454
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,577
whether this was
a romantic situation or not,

455
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,372
<i>and I will reaffirm</i>
<i>that there is no romance.</i>

456
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,582
COLLEEN:
You know,

457
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,293
he reminds me of my friends
back home, so it's like

458
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,545
<i>I can totally, totally</i>
<i>be myself with him.</i>

459
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,547
GREG:
<i>So we like to play together--</i>

460
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,424
<i>not as a romantic situation,</i>
<i>but, yeah</i>

461
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,677
<i>heading back out in the forest</i>
<i>and sleeping out there</i>

462
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,512
<i>and the rest of it is great.</i>

463
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,318
RICHARD:
<i>This is a yellow-banded</i>
<i>sea crate.</i>

464
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,569
<i>We find a number of them</i>
<i>in the jungle.</i>

465
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,614
<i>I haven't seen one</i>
<i>down here on the beach.</i>

466
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,741
<i>I'm hoping</i>
<i>he goes for a swim.</i>

467
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,076
<i>I might help him.</i>

468
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,789
He's awake now.

469
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,582
Oh, I'm not
afraid of snakes.

470
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,666
I mean,
I don't want to be bitten

471
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,878
by something that's deadly,
but, no, I used to play

472
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,421
with garter snakes,
when I was a kid

473
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,964
and feed them frogs, and...

474
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,591
<i>You know, they're not...</i>

475
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,551
<i>They</i> are<i> quick, and it's...</i>
<i>they can move fast,</i>

476
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,512
<i>but you can see</i>
<i>when he's about to coil up</i>

477
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,679
<i>and strike</i>
<i>and you can prepare yourself</i>

478
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,183
<i>and you can get ready to move</i>
<i>before it does.</i>

479
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,313
I want to put him in the water
'cause I want to watch him swim.

480
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:26,863
<i>We've been told</i>

481
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,283
<i>they're extremely deadly--</i>

482
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,370
<i>immediately deadly,</i>
<i>within six hours deadly.</i>

483
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,624
Horseflies bother me more.

484
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,677
SEAN:
<i>I knew today was going to be</i>
<i>a good day when I woke up.</i>

485
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,512
I haven't had a bowel movement
in nearly two weeks.

486
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,682
This morning, I had my first
bowel movement-- felt fantastic.

487
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,809
(<i> cheering</i> )

488
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,644
I am one
of the bowel movers now.

489
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,021
<i>I'm getting thinner</i>
<i>and thinner.</i>

490
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,857
<i>I think I'm using</i>
<i>most of the rice I make</i>

491
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,567
<i>'cause I'm not bloated</i>

492
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,694
<i>and my pants</i>
<i>are getting skinnier.</i>

493
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,362
<i>Very excited about it--</i>
<i>it's the way</i>

494
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,157
<i>to start the day off, with a</i>
<i>little bit of a bowel movement.</i>

495
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,533
Nice work, Sean.

496
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,160
Go, New York, go.

497
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,171
<i>We were concerned about Dirk</i>
<i>and his eating a while ago,</i>

498
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,923
<i>because he was really</i>
<i>disappearing into nothing.</i>

499
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,883
We're all losing a little
bit of weight,

500
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,135
but Dirk was really losing
a lot of weight.

501
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,015
DIRK:
<i>I definitely lost</i>
<i>a lot of mass,</i>

502
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,058
<i>a lot of muscle mass,</i>
<i>a lot of strength.</i>

503
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,643
<i>It's not going to help me</i>

504
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,979
but, as long as I conserve
my energy--

505
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,689
don't waste it on things
that we don't need--

506
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:46,735
as long as I'm smart about it,
I think I'll be okay.

507
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,405
KELLY:
<i>We've noticed Dirk kind of</i>

508
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,656
getting a little skinny.

509
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,366
Um, there was a few days

510
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,368
where we were all
kind of concerned about him

511
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,079
<i>and, uh, he was just kind of...</i>

512
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,707
<i>I think, you know, mentally,</i>
<i>he was a little bummed out</i>

513
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,752
and all of us were, like,
"eat more rice, eat more rice."

514
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,880
DIRK:
We're going on
a tapioca hunt.

515
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,798
That way,
you can eat more, Dirk,

516
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,800
'cause you're looking like hell.

517
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,303
You look like a nazi war
prisoner camp, dude.

518
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,304
I don't look that bad.

519
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,430
Yeah, you do.

520
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,765
Nazi war prisoner
camp dude.

521
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,892
Your Adam's apple's about out
to the bottom of your chin.

522
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,228
Yeah. Hell, my arm's.

523
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:21,811
as big as yours now.

524
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,606
But it was before.

525
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,774
<i>Well, we all kind of try</i>
<i>and keep an eye on him,</i>

526
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,734
'cause he<i> was</i> real skinny
to begin with.

527
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,445
I'm doing the dishes;
I'm going out.

528
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:30,862
We got that.

529
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,615
Anybody else?

530
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,951
KELLY:
<i>The labor thing,</i>
<i>it's actually better now.</i>

531
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,911
<i>Sean and Dirk</i>
<i>started to realize</i>

532
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,622
that they better, you know,
do something.

533
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,249
Otherwise, they're out of here.

534
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,583
Want me to peel
one of the big ones

535
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,125
when you guys are done?

536
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,627
Is there another knife?

537
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,588
SUSAN:
<i>They've kind of come around</i>
<i>the last couple,</i>

538
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,131
<i>two, three days</i>
<i>and started doing</i>

539
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,134
a little more, but it's
a little too late for that.

540
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,512
Maybe I<i> am</i> on thin ice
with this team now.

541
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,763
I don't know.

542
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,848
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I'm pulling my weight</i>

543
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,600
<i>and I think</i>
<i>the group sees that</i>

544
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,811
<i>and I'm just going to find</i>
<i>tapioca, and I'm just going</i>

545
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,020
to let it work itself out.

546
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,480
Where you going?
For tapioca?

547
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,815
SEAN:
Yeah.

548
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,858
KELLY:
You know what the,
uh, roots look like.

549
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,318
Yeah, yeah, I just showed Dirk.

550
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,319
SUSAN:
And you know

551
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,362
what the trunks
look like.

552
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,656
Yeah. No, I just showed him
the thing by the raft.

553
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,366
RICHARD:
<i>Kelly, Sue and I--</i>

554
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,994
<i>we need to decide cohesively</i>
<i>who we're going to reject</i>

555
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,997
<i>and it's between Sean and Dirk,</i>
<i>and Sean--</i>

556
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,707
yesterday, he was talking
about how he doesn't want

557
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,167
to form an alliance
because...

558
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,210
Yeah.

559
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,837
You know,
"do unto others" and...

560
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,339
What? You're
"...as others do unto you."

561
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,632
It's just a game;
this is not real life.

562
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,093
So, we're thinking,
"boy, Sean, it's time
for you to go, bud."

563
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,855
Tapioca's good eating, too.

564
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:47,897
We definitely want a lot of it.

565
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,859
I don't even know if I know
what I'm looking for.

566
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,694
It's a distinctive
reddish root.

567
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,696
Will I know when I find it?

568
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,865
If we look further
along the trail,

569
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,075
maybe we'll have better luck.

570
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,703
I can't find any tapioca, man.

571
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,829
I don't know where it is.

572
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:07,208
SEAN:
Hermit crab crawling
through the jungle.

573
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,210
Look at the claws
on that thing.

574
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,087
They do make them big
here in the jungle.

575
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,088
What about the tapioca?

576
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,341
They make any tapioca
big in this jungle?

577
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,759
Not really.

578
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,011
We still ain't
found any.

579
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,889
We're sucking at
this jungle thing.

580
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,436
SEAN:
<i>There was about five</i>
<i>on this stem that I picked up</i>

581
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,020
<i>but only one was good.</i>

582
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,397
The rest were mushy.

583
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,525
So I had to throw the rest away.

584
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,069
It wasn't a
complete loss.

585
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,779
I think that we've
exhausted our supply.

586
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,239
So that's the end
of the tapioca, then?

587
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,075
I think. I mean,
you guys have better luck.

588
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,993
You can go look, too.

589
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,081
Rather an unsuccessful
hunt for me and you.

590
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,082
Yep.

591
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,750
Maybe it's
you and me, man.

592
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,084
Maybe we're a bad team.

593
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,044
Probably.

594
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,880
We're a fun team, though.

595
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,767
Got our message.

596
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,394
Check it out.

597
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,646
"Selecting one's
always a chore,

598
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,648
"so check your ego
at the door.

599
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,566
"One to row,
the rest to swim.

600
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,069
Make it fast, and
immunity you'll win."

601
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:16,945
It's in the water.
We got to win.

602
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,947
KELLY:
<i>Today's day 15</i>

603
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,283
and we have
an Immunity Challenge today.

604
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,952
Hopefully, um, it'll be
something that, uh...

605
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,622
that we can win pretty handily,
and I don't feel like going

606
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,625
to the Immune Council tonight
by any means.

607
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,627
I think we're
all swimming
except one rower.

608
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,296
Gervase can't
swim, and he's
kind of gangly,

609
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,799
so I don't picture him
rowing all that well.

610
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,342
I don't know.
Maybe he can.

611
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,095
I think we certainly
have an edge up.

612
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,764
Apparently, we need one rower
and the rest of us swimming,

613
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,308
<i>which is good, because we have</i>
<i>Kelly who's a rower.</i>

614
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,810
<i>That's what she does</i>
<i>as a profession for a living.</i>

615
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,312
So it's your turn
to shine, Kel.

616
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,313
Oh, boy.
This is it.

617
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,857
You've been waiting
for this.

618
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,775
Your time
to shine.

619
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,695
KELLY:
<i>I'm a commercial</i>
<i>white-water raft guide,</i>

620
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:02,323
<i>so obviously,</i>
<i>I'm the rower today.</i>

621
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,578
Feeling a little pressure, but
I'm not too worried about it.

622
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:10,039
<i>I know Gervase can't swim,</i>
<i>so my guess</i>

623
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,668
is that they're going to put him
in the boat rowing,

624
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,003
which is cool for me

625
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,963
because I can beat him
any day of the week.

626
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,347
GERVASE:
<i>"Selecting one</i>
<i>is always a chore</i>

627
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,849
"so check your ego at the door.

628
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,643
"One to row, the rest to swim.

629
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,813
Make it fast,
and immunity you'll win."

630
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,192
The decision that is obvious
is that Gervase should row.

631
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:37,984
JENNA:
<i>You can look at it</i>
<i>as a disadvantage</i>

632
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,487
<i>that Gervase can't swim.</i>

633
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,865
But we all are going to have
our differences.

634
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,034
Not all of us are going
to be strong at everything.

635
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,287
Wow.

636
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,164
Swimming and rowing.

637
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,666
I sent Gervase to row
so he doesn't have to swim.

638
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,626
But they'll guess that.

639
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,211
They'll know that
that's what we're doing.

640
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,213
Yeah, but I mean,
what other choice do we have?

641
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,048
We might not even get
a life preserver.

642
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,091
"Check your ego
at the door."

643
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,053
Comfort level with swimming's
about 80%.

644
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,971
I mean, I've heard
you're more buoyant

645
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,474
in the ocean,
because of the salt water.

646
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,059
I don't know that, though.

647
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,269
To me, I'll sink
like I was in a pool.

648
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,562
Maybe we have to build something

649
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,690
and the people who swim have
to push it and one guy rows it.

JEFF:
<i>Today's Immunity Challenge</i>

663
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,896
<i>is called "shipwrecked."</i>

664
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,315
<i>Five members</i>
<i>from each tribe are stranded</i>

665
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,817
<i>on items of floating debris</i>

666
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,821
<i>simulating</i>
<i>a sunken ship disaster.</i>

667
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,073
<i>The remaining two castaways</i>
<i>must rescue</i>

668
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:11,786
<i>the members of their own tribe</i>
<i>by using outrigger canoes.</i>

669
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,746
<i>Kelly was chosen</i>
<i>to row by Tagi</i>

670
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,039
<i>and Gervase</i>
<i>was chosen by Pagong.</i>

671
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,961
<i>Here's the premise.</i>

672
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,129
It's all on you guys.

673
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,172
You're each going to be
in one of these canoes.

674
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,591
You're going to swim out

675
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,801
to the outside
of your buoy--

676
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:27,969
yellow and orange.

677
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,637
Once you go
on the outside

678
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,514
of the buoy,
you start heading back

679
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,641
and you start picking up
tribe members.

680
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,643
Once they are on board, though,

681
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,021
they can start helping you
with paddles.

682
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,940
You've got three paddles,
and you've got one bailer,

683
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,650
'cause you
will take on water today,

684
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,944
as rough
as it is.

685
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,987
It's for immunity.

686
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,656
Losing tribe's coming to
Tribal Council tonight.

687
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,033
So what I want to know is,

688
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,452
how did you guys
get selected for this?

689
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,870
Why are you the rower?

690
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,121
Well, I'm a water all-star,

691
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,333
so this is my element
right here,

692
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,293
so there was no choice.

693
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,502
You, on the other hand,
water is...

694
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,130
as we've talked about, this
is a whole new thing for you.

695
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,132
Yes, yes.

696
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,634
Are you rowing
because you'd

697
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,885
rather row
than swim?

698
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,179
I think that's what we
were thinking at first,

699
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,807
but I knew it would be
something kind of tricky

700
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,310
and it's show time,
so I like the spotlight.

701
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,062
Really? Lot of pressure.

702
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,063
Pressure's good.

703
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,064
They're doing

704
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,148
nothing out there.

705
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,191
It is all
the person on the boat.

706
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,360
All right. Good luck.

707
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,402
Thank you.

708
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,488
For the idol, get in your boats.

709
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,244
Survivors ready?

710
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,663
Go!

711
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,281
(<i> paddle splashing</i> )

712
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,472
(<i> paddles splashing</i> )

713
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,130
(<i> all shouting</i> )

714
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,140
Get out! Get out!

715
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,310
Get out!
Get out!

716
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,061
Over here.

717
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,688
Over this way.

718
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,315
Over to the right.

719
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,901
Get it up here!

720
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:38,284
(<i> all cheering</i> )

721
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,293
(<i> cheering</i> )

722
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,963
JEFF:
Gervase's
last words were,

723
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,340
"I like the spotlight.

724
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,925
Bring it on."

725
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:54,383
Who's invincible
tonight?

726
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,260
Gervase!

727
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,678
Does anybody

728
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,014
feel especially
invincible tonight?

729
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,186
I got beat by a guy
who can't even swim.

730
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,064
Yeah, but he
wasn't swimming.

731
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,398
Yeah.

732
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,399
Go, Kelly.

733
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,193
I can't
believe that

734
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,195
I lost that.

735
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,196
Hey, guys,

736
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,324
the immunity idol.

737
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,910
Welcome back home,
immunity idol!

738
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,272
KELLY:
<i>Tonight we have to take</i>
<i>the suckfest hike</i>

739
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,733
<i>to the Tribal Council,</i>

740
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,862
<i>and we get to vote somebody off</i>
<i>tonight, unfortunately.</i>

741
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,405
<i>You know, despite everything,</i>

742
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,491
I was the best choice
to put in that boat today,

743
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,617
<i>and, you know, like I said,</i>

744
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,745
<i>sometimes your best</i>
<i>just isn't good enough</i>

745
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,082
and life just wouldn't be life
if everybody didn't get

746
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,376
their little embarrassments
from time to time, so...

747
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,378
That which doesn't
kill you

748
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,921
makes you stronger,
right, Sean?

749
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:14,964
Absolutely.

750
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,424
I say that to myself
all the time.

751
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,425
Me, too.

752
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,051
Same exact sentence.

753
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,720
<i>Oh, yeah, it's always</i>
<i>in the back of my mind</i>

754
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,096
<i>whether or not</i>

755
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,764
anyone's going to vote
against me.

756
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,725
I don't have a vote
against me yet,

757
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,561
and now we're losing numbers
so I'm sure one's coming,

758
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,605
<i>just like the other people</i>
<i>who don't have a vote</i>

759
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,648
<i>against them, one's coming</i>
<i>in their direction, too.</i>

760
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,941
I suspect it might be Rudy.

761
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,403
<i>That's how I'll probably cast</i>
<i>my vote at this point.</i>

762
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,156
I'm ready.

763
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,033
RICHARD:
<i>It's an interesting game,</i>
<i>but it's a game,</i>

764
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,951
and I've had
a strategy from day one.

765
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,413
<i>I've already built an alliance</i>
<i>and we're going to work through</i>

766
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,499
<i>as best we can right to the end</i>

767
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,335
before the free-for-all.

768
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,295
Just walking to our death
right here.

769
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,796
DIRK:
<i>I think I'm vulnerable.</i>

770
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,132
<i>I've tried my hardest</i>
<i>and put as much effort</i>

771
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:01,344
<i>if not more into everything,</i>
<i>but I haven't been successful</i>

772
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,970
<i>in any areas so maybe some</i>

773
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,804
people will look at that
and say,

774
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,473
"Dirk doesn't know
what he's doing.

775
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,141
He's being lazy." Whatever.

776
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,809
<i>But I think they realize that</i>
<i>I'm a valuable member</i>

777
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,312
<i>of this team, so I'm not</i>
<i>worried about being voted off.</i>

778
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,648
<i>I think I'll be here tomorrow.</i>

779
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,066
Ready?

780
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,188
What's to say?

781
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,731
Tribal council.

782
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,192
Tough situation.
Kelly, tell me about morale.

783
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,861
Two tough losses back-to-back.

784
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:06,033
Personally, for me,
today was really hard.

785
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:10,162
Um... coulda, shoulda, woulda
a lot of things, you know?

786
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,873
I said some things
at the beach... whatever.

787
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,708
I'm not making excuses,

788
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,003
not trying to,
not going to, you know?

789
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,548
I gave it my best today
and just wasn't good enough,

790
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,675
so ate a little crow,
it's all right.

791
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,844
Doesn't mean I
have to like it.

792
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,721
Sean, your role here?

793
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,555
Very nebulous.

794
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,266
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

795
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,059
After how long we been here?

796
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,060
15, 16 days.

797
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,895
I still haven't found my niche.

798
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,023
I'm just here
to have fun.

799
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,399
I'll take it as far
as I can go

800
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,526
till you throw me kicking
and screaming off this island.

801
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,695
Dirk?

802
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,904
It seems like
I've noticed

803
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,906
you spending
more time alone.

804
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,200
How much of that time
do you spend thinking

805
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:52,246
about how effective you are
at fitting in this group?

806
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,831
I'd say very little.

807
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,583
I can't think myself into being
more effective, you know?

808
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,584
I'm working hard.

809
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,586
I'm catching fish

810
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,546
and I've been completely
unsuccessful.

811
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,964
I'm working hard
at hunting tapioca

812
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,090
and I've been completely
unsuccessful.

813
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,592
I've been working ha...

814
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,552
You know, it's like I've failed
at everything I've tried,

815
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,346
but it's not like
the effort's not there,

816
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,097
you know what
I'm saying?

817
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,599
Richard?n.

818
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,142
15 days now together,

819
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:17,355
inevitable that certain
alliances, even within a group,

820
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,106
smaller factions begin
to develop.

821
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,483
Have you guys
reached a point now

822
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,151
where you have
this tight unit

823
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,071
that these alliances are going
to come in to play in the vote?

824
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,615
The alliances that you talk
about, the Rudy and I

825
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,951
and the Sean and Dirk
kind of hanging,

826
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,622
and the Sue and Kelly together,
are almost kind of little teams

827
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,416
within a team doing things

828
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,128
'cause it usually takes
a couple of people to do things.

829
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,591
I think a bigger alliance is
what all six of us have created

830
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:50,096
so I don't think that
the smaller ones detract

831
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,474
from how we feel about
the six of...

832
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,476
all of us together.

833
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,852
It's time to vote.

834
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,479
Dirk.

835
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:18,290
I love you, but I just can't
stand the complaining.

836
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,811
For the first time,
I'm voting for Rudy,

837
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,187
only because this is

838
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,022
probably an athletic competition
coming up

839
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,858
that we're going
to have to win

840
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:48,904
and that's the only reason
I would cast a vote against him.

841
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,322
He's a phenomenal person.

842
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,590
Fire represents life
on the island.

843
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,925
Your torches represent
your identity here.

844
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,552
Directly across from you are

845
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,680
four torches that represent
the first four people

846
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,891
that have been voted
off the island.

847
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,769
Tonight, a fifth torch
will be added to that group.

848
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,730
I'll go tally the votes.

849
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,584
Before I read the votes,
I just want to remind you

850
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,752
once they're tallied,
the decision is final

851
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,255
and the person must
leave the island immediately.

852
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,591
I'll read
the votes.

853
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,639
First vote...

854
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,681
"Dirk."

855
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:03,646
"Sue."

856
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,821
"Rudy."

857
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,663
"Dirk."

858
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:24,583
That's two
votes for Dirk.

859
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,839
"Dirk."

860
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,092
That's three votes.

861
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,052
We don't need to
read the last one.

862
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,693
The tribe
has spoken.

863
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,282
It's time for
you to go.

864
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,324
All right.

865
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:57,741
Guys, good luck.

866
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,844
You can take your torches
and head back to camp.

867
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,886
Good night.

868

<i>at Tagi,</i>

871
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:46,874
<i>Rich goes native.</i>

872
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,875
Who cares?

<i>Over at Pagong,</i>

00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,503
<i>Gervase ruffles some feathers</i>

875
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,213
<i>with a sexist remark.</i>

876
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,257
Girls are the stupidest thing
on the planet next to cows.

877
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,383
It's a fact, though.

878
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,301
Oh, I beg to differ.

879
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,553
GRETCHEN:
<i>So, I told those girls,</i>

880
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:02,222
<i>when they write your name</i>
<i>on that piece of paper,</i>

881
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,891
and look straight into the lens
and go, "moo."

I guess I want to start
by just thanking the Lord

885
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,026
<i>just for this</i>
<i>unbelievable blessing.</i>

886
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,905
<i>I mean, this whole thing</i>
<i>has just been one wild trip.</i>

887
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,532
<i>He had 15 days planned</i>
<i>for me on this island.</i>

888
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,784
<i>I believe I kicked it</i>
<i>as hard as I could.</i>

889
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:25,329
<i>Completely surprised</i>
<i>to be taken out this early</i>

890
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,580
and I thank the Lord
for that,

891
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:27,373
'cause I know
he's got a plan

892
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,249
for me to move on
somewhere else.
