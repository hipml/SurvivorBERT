1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,420
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,547
"SURVIVOR," A SURPRISE SWITCH
SHOOK UP THE GAME.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,134
WE ARE CHANGING FROM TWO TRIBES
TO THREE TRIBES.

4
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:14,931
AT THE NUKU TRIBE, J.T. WAS
OUTNUMBERED.

5
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:15,974
>> IT'S 5-1.

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:20,562
>> Jeff: AT THE TAVUA TRIBE,
TROYZAN HAD NO CONTROL.

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,605
>> IT'S TROYZAN VERSUS EVERYONE.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,609
>> Jeff: AT THE MANA TRIBE,
BRAD HELD ALL THE POWER.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:33,199
>> IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO
EITHER HALI OR CALEB.

10
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,286
>> Jeff: AND AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, BRAD RALLIED THE TRIBE

11
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,662
TO VOTE OUT CALEB.

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,958
>> CALEB, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,126
>> Jeff: 17 ARE LEFT.

14
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,171
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

15
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:58,183
>> Jeff:>> TAI, I KNOW THAT WAS
YOU.

16
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,269
>> IT WAS DIFFICULT, BUT IT'S A
GAME.

17
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,145
IT'S MY GAME.

18
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,146
>> RIGHT.

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,149
>> THANK YOU FOR TRUSTING ME.

20
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,693
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE ANY
SUSPICIONS.

21
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,154
>> ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN
WORDS, ESPECIALLY ON "SURVIVOR."

22
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,323
>> YEAH.

23
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,202
I'M VERY CLOSE TO CALEB, SO THIS
VOTE WAS REALLY HARD TO ME, BUT

24
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:22,499
I WANT TO EARN MY TRUST FROM THE
REST OF MY TRIBE.

25
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,626
I'M NOT PLAYING WITH MY HEART
THIS TIME.

26
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:28,004
I'M PLAYING WITH MY HEAD.

27
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,673
>> I THINK WE'RE DOING WELL WITH
THE VOTE SO FAR.

28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,341
>> WE'RE DOING GREAT.

29
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,343
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

30
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,511
>> ME, TOO.

31
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:39,265
>> CALEB GOING HOME LAST NIGHT
INSTEAD OF ME WAS A BREAK IN

32
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:39,974
THIS GAME.

33
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,185
>> IF WE LOSE, WHO WOULD YOU GO?

34
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,394
>> I'D GO TAI.

35
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,357
>> I KNOW DEBBIE AND TAI DO HAVE
A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP, SO

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,403
I'M TRYING TO SHOW DEBBIE THAT I
AM YOUR ASSET GOING FORWARD, AND

37
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,363
TAI IS A LIABILITY.

38
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,991
>> I MEAN, I'M TAI NEXT.

39
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,701
OH, MY GOD, AM I HIM NEXT.

40
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,912
BECAUSE IF WE LOSE, HEY, THEN WE
LOSE.

41
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,080
>> WE GOT A PLAN.

42
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:07,877
>> THIS IS MY SECOND TIME
PLAYING, NOT MY FIRST, SO I TELL

43
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,881
HALI JUST WHAT I THINK SHE WANTS
TO HEAR, BUT THE PHILOSOPHY FOR

44
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:17,887
THIS MANA TRIBE IS TO KEEP OLD
NUKU TRIBE.

45
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,557
>> IT OBVIOUSLY DOES, RIGHT?

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,102
>> YEAH, IF WE NEWS, WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING, EVERYBODY IS

47
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:24,894
LOCKED DOWN?

48
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,229
>> THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY
IT.

49
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:31,776
>> IT'S TOO SOON TO MAKE TAI A
TARGET, SO HALI, YOU HAVE NO

50
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,193
OPTIONS.

51
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:40,702
YOU HAVE NONE.

52
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:53,756
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,468
NUKU AND TAVUA GETTING YOUR
FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW MANA

54
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:57,844
TRIBE.

55
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:58,469
>> OH, WOW.

56
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,554
>> OH, WOW.

57
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,432
>> Jeff: CALEB VOTED OUT AT
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

58
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:07,729
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

59
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,771
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

60
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,481
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?

61
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,608
>> YEAH.

62
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,443
>> Jeff: TODAY WE'RE DOING
SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

63
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:18,239
ONLY TWO MEMBERS OF EACH TRIBE
WILL RUN THIS CHALLENGE.

64
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,365
>> OKAY.

65
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,076
>> Jeff: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:
THE FIRST PLAYER WILL RACE

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,457
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES
WHILE BALANCING A BALL ON THE

67
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,958
END OF A POLL.

68
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,546
AT THE END OF EACH LEG YOU ADD
MORE POLE MAKE IT MORE

69
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,464
DIFFICULT.

70
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,799
AT THE END YOU USE A BALL TO
RELEASE A KEY.

71
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,009
THAT WILL OPEN A BOX.

72
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:42,263
YOU USE THE SANDBAGS INSIDE TO
KNOCK DOWN NINE BAMBOO TARGETS.

73
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,432
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
REWARD.

74
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,142
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

75
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:46,476
>> YEAH.

76
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,519
>> YES.

77
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,647
>> OH, GOD.

78
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,190
>> OH, YEAH.

79
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,858
>> LOOK AT ALL THAT.

80
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,943
HOLY CRAP.

81
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,569
>> Jeff: EVERYTHING YOU NEED
FOR A NICE CUP OF COFFEE

82
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,114
INCLUDING CHOCOLATE COOKIES.

83
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:00,990
>> CHOCOLATE.

84
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:01,824
>> WOW.

85
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,119
>> JEFF, WE LOVE YOU.

86
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:10,208
>> Jeff: SECOND TRIBE TO

87
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:10,875
COFFEE.

88
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,585
LAST TRIBE TO FINISH, NOTHING.

89
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,882
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU GUYS A
MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE, DECIDE WHO

90
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,969
YOUR TWO WILL BE, AND WE'LL GET
STARTED.

91
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:21,678
ALL RIGHT.

92
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,680
WE HAVE OUR PAIRS FOR EACH
TRIBE.

93
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,600
FOR NUKU IT IS J.T. CARRYING THE
BALL, MALCOLM THROWING SANDBAGS.

94
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:33,064
FOR TAVUA, IT'S OZZY CARRYING
THE BALL, TROYZAN THROWING SAND

95
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,190

>> EASY.

102

>> Jeff: THIS FIRST SECTION,
THERE YOU GO, YOU'VE GOT TO GO

103
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,749
UNDER, BUT THE BALL HAS TO GO
OVER.

104
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,876
J.T. DROPS.

105
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,670
OZZY'S THROUGH.

106
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,170

114
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,769
AND HE'S NOW THROUGH THE
TOUGHEST PART.

115
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,565

TAI HAS HIS SECOND SECTION OF
POLE.

123
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,040
HE'S GOING TO START ON THE

130
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,890
THE BALANCE BEAM ALONE IS
TRICKY.

131
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,850
J.T.'S MADE UP A LOT OF TIME.

132
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,434
CAN HE GET THERE?

133
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,436

WE'RE TIED.

169
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,681
BOTH GUYS HAVE FIVE TARGETS
LEFT.

TAI STILL ON THAT BEAM.

171
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,184
CULPEPPER WAITING FOR CHANCE TO
GET IN THERE.

>> TAKE YOUR TIME, TAI, RELAX.

173
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,021
I CAN CATCH THEM.

>> WE THOUGHT WE HAD IT.

230
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,980
BY TROYZAN DROPPED THE BALL.

231
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,647
HE WAS TERRIBLE.

232
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,316
HE ALREADY WAS THE ODD MAN OUT.

233
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,442
NOW TROYZAN'S LIFE IS HANGING ON
BY A STRING.

234
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,584
>> HOME SWEET HOME.

235
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,627
>> YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME.

236
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,339
>> I WANTED TO WIN IT FOR YOU
GUYS.

237
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,010
>> AS A TRIBE, LOSING IS ALWAYS
HORRIBLE, LIKE WE ALL WANT TO

238
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,303
WIN.

239
00:09:55,386 --> 00:10:00,182
BUT LOSING THE REWARD CHALLENGE
WAS GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE WITHOUT

240
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:08,733
REWARDS THEY NEED ME TO SURVIVE
IN THIS GAME.

241
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,737
I FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT I'VE
BEEN DOING AN AWESOME JOB BEING

242
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,905
THE ROCK OF THIS TRIBE.

243
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:19,035
NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN, BUT I'M
ABLE TO CATCH FISH.

244
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,205
I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE A CONSTANT
SUPPLY OF GREAT PROTEIN.

245
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,084
IF I DIDN'T BRING FOOD IN, MY
NAME WOULD COME UP A LOT MORE

246
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,377
THAN IT DOES.

247
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,048
BUT MORE THAN, THAT IT'S ALMOST
LIKE A MEDITATION, FISHING GIVES

248
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,426
ME A CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT THE
GAME AND COME BACK A LITTLE MORE

249
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,093
GROUNDED.

250
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,472
IT'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY.

251
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,061
>> OH, MY GOD.

252
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,896
IT'S A BIG OLD FISH, BRO.

253
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,398
>> DUDE, THAT THING LOOKS HUGE.

254
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,900
>> IT WAS UNDERNEATH A ROCK.

255
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,026
I SAW IT MOVE.

256
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,445
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HAVE BEEN
A BOTTOM FISH.

257
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,864
>> LOOK AT THAT.

258
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,908
>> THAT'S AWESOME.

259
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,702
>> OZZY IS NO JOKE.

260
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,913
AS FAN OF THE SHOW, JUST SEEING
HIM IN ACTION IS AMAZING.

261
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,750
HE CAUGHT THIS STINGRAY, SO
WE'RE GOING TO GET A MEAL, AND

262
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,961
HOPEFULLY THAT'S GOING TO GIVE
US MORE CONFIDENCE TO DO WELL IN

263
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:11,879
THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

264
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,589
>> I'M GOING TO GO BACK OUT.

265
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,298
>> ALL RIGHT.

266
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:20,596
YOU'RE AWESOME.

267
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,764
>> THANK YOU, J.T., AND MALCOLM.

00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,066
>> HOLY COW.

273
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,445
>> OH, MY GOD.

274
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,446
>> OH.

00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,241
>> THIS TRIBE HAS GOT IT GOING
ON, LET ME TELL YOU.

276
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,953
THIS IS THE BEST TRIBE EVER.

277
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,455
I'M ECSTATIC HERE AT THE NUKU
TRIBE.

278
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,792

00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,292
EVERYONE ARE PERFECT.

280

I'M THE QUEEN HERE.

281
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,753
I KNOW THAT MUCH.

282
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,630
I KNOW I'M RUNNING THE SHOW.

283
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:59,969
AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS IT.

284
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,429
>> EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

285
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,640
YOU KNOW WHAT, IF WE GO TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL, SANDRA'S

286
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,307
DANGEROUS.

287
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,517
I THINK WE GET RID OF SANDRA.

288
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,477
>> I'M STARTING TO THINK SO.

289
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,645
TOO.

290
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,939
>> THE LONGER SANDRA'S IN THIS
GAME, THE MORE TROUBLE WE'LL

HAVE GETTING RID OF HER.

292
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,193
SHE'S A TWO-TIME WINNER FOR MORE
THAN ONE REASON.

293
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,990
YOU CAN TELL BY THE ATTITUDE AND
THES ASs IN SANDRA'S VOICE,

294
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,325
SHE KNOWS SHE'S IN CHARGE.

295
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,037
>> IF ANYBODY SAYS YOUR NAME,
I'LL COME STRAIGHT TO YOU.

296
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,164
>> YOU GOT THE SAME.

297
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,291
>> MALCOLM AND I HIT IT OFF.

298
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,292
MALCOLM IS EXCITED.

299
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,168
I CAN SEE IT.

300
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,335
HE WANTS TO PLAY WITH ME.

301
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,173
I DON'T PLAN ON LOSING, BUT IF
WE LOSE AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,

302
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,299
WING, BANG, MOVE, I CAN MAKE MY
MOVE AND GET RID OF SANDRA.

303
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:07,953
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

304
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,038

PERSON WILL BE YOUR CALLER.

310
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:30,434
THE REST OF THE TRIBE WILL BE
BLINDFOLDED AND TETHERED

311
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,396
TOGETHER IN PAIRS, USING ONLY
VERBAL COMMANDS, A CALLER WILL

312
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,442
GUIDE THEIR TRIBE THROUGH A
SERIES OF OBSTACLES.

313
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,279

SO IF WE STAY TOGETHER, IT'S
VERY SIMPLE ON PAPER, BUT ON

525
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,694
PAPER IS THE ONLY PLACE IT'S
SIMPLE.

526
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:47,199
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME IN, WE
HAVE FIVE PEOPLE, TOO BAD, LIKE

527
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,034
ONE OF US IS GOING TO GO HOME.

528
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,035
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A PLAN.

529
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,121
>> THEY'RE GOING TO GET J.T. TO
VOTE WITH THEM.

530
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,623
>> YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT IT IS?

531
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,335
>> THEY WILL TRY TO GET ME,
SURE.

532
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,628
BUT I'M SOLID.

533
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,964
I'M SOLID WITH YOU GUYS 100% SO
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

534
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,634
>> IT TAKES ONE PERSON TO FLIP
THE CHANGE EVERYTHING, BUT WE

535
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,135
HAVE TO VOTE SIX STRONG.

536
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,597
IF SOMEONE MESSES THIS UP,
THEY'RE GETTING THEIR ASS BEATEN

537
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,848
WHEN THEY COME BACK TO THIS
CAMP.

538
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:19,064
>> THIS IS THE PERSON I THINK WE
SHOULD VOTE OUT AND WHY, SIERRA,

539
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,524
BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR STRONGEST
FEMALE OVER THERE.

540
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:25,278
>> I DON'T THINK NOBODY HAS AN
IDOL.

541
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,157
>> I'M NOT WILLING TO RISK MY
LIFE THEY DON'T.

542
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,159
>> I SAY GET RID OF TAI.

543
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,619
HE'S SNEAKY AS HELL, END OF
STORY.

544
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,455
>> WE'RE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE.

545
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,540
EVERYBODY IS ON THEIR OWN PAGE.

546
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,666
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

547
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,961
AND EVERYBODY PLAYS AS PART OF A
TRIBE.

548
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,506
BUT IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL GAME FROM
THE BEGINNING, REGARDLESS OF

549
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,633
WHAT ANYBODY SAYS.

550
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:53,849
>> WHO DO YOU THINK BRAD WILL
TARGET OVER HERE?

551
00:23:53,932 --> 00:24:01,857
WHO DO YOU THINK THEY'LL TARGET?

552
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:07,737
>> I WOULD SAY ME, BUT I DON'T
KNOW.

553
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:12,534
>> THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY
RELATIONSHIP I HAVE ON THE MANA

554
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,536
TRIBE IS BRAD CULPEPPER.

555
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,623
IF I WAS A BETTING MAN, BRAD IS
SAYING, ALL OUR VOTES ARE GOING

556
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,875
FOR SANDRA.

557
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,335
I COULD BE A SWING VOTE AND VOTE
SANDRA, BUT THAT'S A BIG RISK.

558
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:27,174
I COULD JUST SIMPLY GO WITH
MAJORITY AND VOTE SIERRA OR TAI.

559
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:27,924
HMMM.

560
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,050
BUT I'D MUCH RATHER SEE SANDRA
GO.

561
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:33,388
IF I WANTED TO, I COULD
DEFINITELY CHANGE THE COURSE OF

562
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,892
THIS GAME BIG TIME.

563
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:45,025
GET A LITTLE JACKED UP.

564
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:49,446
>> I THINK WE NEED TO CONVINCE
THEM TO TAKE OUT SANDRA.

565
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,240
>> THIS TRIBAL CAN BE EXTREMELY
COMPLICATED.

566
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,201
NOW WE'RE GOING WITH THEM HAVING
SIX AGAINST OUR FIVE.

567
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,703
I KNOW THIS THAT FOUR OF US WILL
ALL VOTE ONE WAY.

568
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:01,708
WE HAVE ONE WILD CARD, HALI, WHO
USED TO BE ON DEATH ROW,

569
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:07,464
HOWEVER, NOW THE "SURVIVOR" GODS
SMILED ON HER AND SHE'S IN AN

570
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,590
ENVIABLE POSITION.

571
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,092
>> BLUE EYES, LOOK AT ME, ARE WE
GOING TO BE FIVE STRONG.

572
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,595
>> I'M ON THE MINORITY IF WE'RE
GOING AGAINST THEM, YOU KNOW,

573
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,056
LIKE FIVE VERSUS SIX.

574
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,976
>> THE BOND YOU BUILD HERE ARE
BETTER THAN THE BONDS YOU BUILT

575
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,688
AT THE OTHER PLACE, SO IF WE CAN
STAY FIVE UNANIMOUS, THAT WILL

576
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,481
SPEAK VOLUMES.

577
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:24,981
>> YEAH.

578
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,274
>> OH, MY GOSH.

579
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,860
ALL OF A SUDDEN, OH, LOOK HOW
THE TABLES HAVE TURNED.

580
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,780
I MEAN, I HAVE OPTIONS.

581
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,741
I COULD GO WITH THIS TRIBE, BUT
I COULD ALSO FLIP.

582
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,662
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT
DYNAMICS GOING ON.

583
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,790
YOU NEED TO CONSIDER YOUR
SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM GAME AT

584
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,000
THE SAME TIME IN THIS VOTE.

585
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,127
>> I THINK J.T.'S GOING TO GO
SANDRA.

586
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,087
>> THEN WE SHOULD.

587
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,673
>> WE SHOULD, BUT I WISH WE WERE
GOING MALCOLM.

588
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,050
>> J.T. DOESN'T KNOW WHO WE'RE
GOING TO VOTE FOR.

589
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:52,968
>> HE DOES.

590
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:53,802
HE WOULD VOTE SANDRA.

591
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,387
>> FROM CONVERSATIONS...

592
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,805
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO VOTE
MALCOLM.

593
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,641
>> I KNOW WE HAVE TO VOTE
SANDRA, BUT IT'S SO STUPID NOT

594
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,684
TO GET MALCOLM OUT.

595
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,645
>> WE HAVE TO BE FIVE STRONG NO
MATTER WHAT WE DO.

596
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,646
>> ABSOLUTELY.

597
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,814
>> IT'S J.T.'S VOTE.

598
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,691
>> IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO
J.T.

599
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,693
>> IT'S VERY TRICKY TONIGHT,
BECAUSE WE STILL DON'T KNOW

600
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,487
WHETHER J.T. IS WITH US OR WITH
THEM.

601
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,658
AND THEY GOT THE NUMBERS, WHY
WOULDN'T THEY STICK TOGETHER?

602
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:27,294
SO I NEED TO LOOK FOR A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

603
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:33,591
MY MIND IS IDOL, IDOL, IDOL,
WHERE DO I GO?

604
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:41,516
IF YOU HAVE IT, IT'S PROTECTION.

605
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,060
I THOUGHT I'D FOUND THE IDOL.

606
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,313
BUT I FOUND THE CLUE.

607
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,480
WHOA.

608
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:52,569
OH, MY GOD.

609
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,822
THE CLUE TELLS ME TO COME TO A
CLEARING NEAR THE TRIBE FLAG.

610
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:59,659
THAT'S THE TREE WITH TWO MARKERS
LINED UP.

611
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,829
ANOTHER TREE WITH THREE MARKERS
LINED UP WITH A FIVE FLAG.

612
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:10,795
MAKE A CROSS, THAT'S WHERE TO
DIG.

613
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,175
I CAN CHANGE THE GAME AROUND.

614
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:19,888
YOU NEVER GIVE UP IN "SURVIVOR"
UNTIL YOUR TORCH IS OUT.

615
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,557
>> OH, MY GOD.

616
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,602
OH, MY GOD.

617
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,229
THIS IDOL WILL GIVE ME POWER.

618
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,775
THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS, WE HAVE
THE IDOL.

619
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,735
THE BEST KEY THE LIFE.

620
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,738
KEY TO A LIFE.

621
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,864
>> I'M SCARED.

622
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,241
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

623
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:45,038
>> YOU HAVE BAD FEELING?

624
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,414
>>
>> HOLD ON.

625
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,875
>> WHAT?

626
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,710
>> I HAVE AN IDOL.

627
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,795
>> GOOD FOR YOU, TAI.

628
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,755
THAT IS FRICKING AWESOME.

629
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:58,593
>> RIGHT BEFORE TRIBAL, TAI HAS
FOUND AN IDOL.

630
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,930
>> IF ONE OF US FOUR IS GOING TO
GO, IT NEEDS TO BE PLAYED.

631
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,767
>> I'M EXTREMELY EXCITED BUT I'M
ALSO COMPLETELY TERRIFIED

632
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,602
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO TO
PLAY IT FOR.

633
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,230
>> LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
THIS IS A HUGE GAME CHANGER.

634
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,439
>> HUGE.

635
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,942
>> A LOT CAN GO WRONG, BUT I'M
PRAYING WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN

636
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,404
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE
MOVE.

637
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,781
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL HAS NEVER BEEN
DONE BEFORE.

638
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,283
THIS IS GOING TO BE CRAZY,
BECAUSE IT CAN BE ANYBODY

639
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,368
TONIGHT.

640
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,982
>> Jeff: J.T. GO AHEAD AND
GRAB THE UNLIT TORCH.

641
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:59,028
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

642
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,198
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

643
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,994
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE,
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO

644
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,788
ARE YOU.

645
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,959
SO MALCOLM, NEW TWIST, WHAT WAS
THE FEELING WHEN YOU WENT BACK

646
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,879
TO CAMP KNOWING ALL OF YOU WOULD
BE COMING TOGETHER TO VOTE OUT

647
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,130
JUST ONE PERSON.

648
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:21,843
>> YOU KNOW, WHO CAN COUNT HOW
MANY TRIBAL COUNCILS THIS GROUP

649
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,011
HAS TO COUNT TOGETHER.

650
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,471
THIS ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE ANY OF
THOSE.

651
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,182
YOU HAVE TO RUN THROUGH EVERY
SCENARIO POSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT

652
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,683
HOW TO PLAY IT.

653
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:31,019
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER, IT COULD
BE EASY TO SAY, THERE'S SIX

654
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,189
VERSUS FIVE, EXCEPT EVERYBODY
HAS THEIR OWN AGENDA.

655
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,818
>> WELL, WE IN THE BUSINESS CALL
A MEXICAN STANDOFF MOW TEACHLY.

656
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,069
WE HAVE OUR GUNS AGAINST THEM.

657
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:44,032
THEY GOT THEIR GUNS AGAINST US,
THE QUESTION IS ONE OF THEIR

658
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,660
GUNS POINTED AT THEMSELVES AND
IS ONE OF OUR GUNS POINTED AT

659
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,536
OURSELVES.

660
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,539
>> JEFF, ALL OUR GUNS ARE
POINTED AT THEM.

661
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,335
>> Jeff: DEBBIE, WHAT COULD
THE FIVE OF YOU DO TO UPSET THE

662
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,544
SIX?

663
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,048
>> WELL, WE HAVE SOMEBODY IN
THEIR SIX WHO USED TO BE REALLY,

664
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,758
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY CLOSE TO
US.

665
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,759
>> Jeff: WHO IS THAT?

666
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,718
>> J.T.

667
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:07,972
>> Jeff: SHE SAID THE MAGIC
WORDS.

668
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:08,890
"USED TO."

669
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,101
>> Jeff: J.T., IT IS A TOUGH
GAME THE PLAY.

670
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,978
YOU STARTED THE GAME WITH ONE
GROUP.

671
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,231
YOU NOW MIGHT BE ON A TRIBE WITH
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

672
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,398
WHERE ARE YOU WITH ALL OF THIS?

673
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,902
>> I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE
EXPECTING ME TO DO SOMETHING TO

674
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,988
PUT MYSELF AT RISK WHEN IT WOULD
BE A SHOT IN THE DARK FOR ME TO

675
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,907
LAND IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

676
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,701
>> Jeff: LET'S LOOK BIG
PICTURE, THERE ARE A LOT OF

677
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,996
THREATS OUT HERE, AND I THINK
THERE ARE MORE THREATS ON THEIR

678
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,123
TEAM, YOU HAVE MALCOLM AND YOU
GOT A TWO-TIME WINNER OVER

679
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,917
THERE.

680
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,876
THAT'S THE BIGGEST THREAT HERE.

681
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,295
>> Jeff: SANDRA, YOU'RE NOT
SURPRISED BY THIS.

682
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,798
YOU ARE CLEARLY A THREAT IN THAT
YOU'VE NEVER LOST.

683
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,633
>> OH, I'M NOT WORRIED.

684
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,593
I KNOW I'M NOT GOING HOME
TONIGHT.

685
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,888
HOW ABOUT THAT?

686
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,558
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, CULPEPPER
MENTIONED SANDRA, HE MENTIONED

687
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,725
YOU.

688
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:57,814
>> SOUNDS LIKE THE SORT OF THING
YOU SCARED, BUT WHEN THESE

689
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,984
TWISTS HAPPEN, BUT IF IT SENT ME
HOME, I'D BE CUSSING MY NAME

690
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,151
DOWN THE RAMP.

691
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:06,239
>> Jeff: VARNER, HAS BE THERE
BEEN MUCH TALK ABOUT IDOLS?

692
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:10,118
>> YEAH, WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT
COULD HAPPEN, WHAT IF EACH

693
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,287
INDIVIDUAL ONE HAD THE IDOL, HOW
THAT WOULD GO.

694
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,580
WE RAN THROUGH EVERYTHING.

695
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:17,083
>> JEFF, AS MUCH AS THEY TALKED
AT THE BIG PICTURE, WE LOOKED AT

696
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,043
THE BIG PICTURE.

697
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,420
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

698
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,088
IT'S JUST WHO DO YOU GO WITH
TONIGHT.

699
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,299
>> Jeff: DEBBIE, WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING RIGHT NOW?

700
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,636
>> I HAVE TWO BIG QUESTIONS,
DOES HE FLIP, DOES SHE FLIP?

701
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,765
>> Jeff: AS FOR HALI, SHOULD
SHE NOT STAY FIRM WITH US, SHE'S

702
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,475
GOING TO BE PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER
ONE.

703
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,605
>> I DON'T KNOW, THAT'S NOT A
GOOD SPEECH TO GROOM ME IN.

704
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,814
>> THAT'S TRUE.

705
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:43,651
>> I JUST WANT TO THROW IT OUT,
THERE WE ARE IN A POTENTIAL

706
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,113
DRAWING ROCK SITUATION, SO MORE
INFORMATION COULD POTENTIALLY

707
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,156
AVOID THAT.

708
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:52,452
IF YOU DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT
YOUR ROCK-SOLID PLAN.

709
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,997
>> Jeff: NO, WE DON'T HAVE NO
CONCERNS.

710
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,166
>> SOUNDS LIKE THEY DON'T NEED
YOU, HALI.

711
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,045
>> WE NEED YOU AND WANT YOU.

712
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,339
>> ON THE OUTSIDE, RIGHT WHERE
THEY PUT YOU.

713
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,841
>> Jeff: J.T., THAT GOT A
REACTION FROM YOU.

714
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,469
ARE YOU GENUINELY DISTRESSED?

715
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,845
>> VERY MUCH SO, YEAH.

716
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:13,848
I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS GOING
THROUGH MY HEAD SINCE I'VE BEEN

717
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,559
HERE, BUT I GOT TO DO WHAT I GOT
TO DO TO STAY ALIVE.

718
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,980
>> AND AS YOU'RE TALKING, SIERRA
AND HALI ARE HAVING A

719
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,690
CONVERSATION THAT MALCOLM IS
JUST EAVESDROPPING ON.

720
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,900
>> I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.

721
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:28,029
I THINK THIS IS A STUPID TIME IN
THE GAME TO BE THINKING ABOUT

722
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,490
ANYTHING EXCEPT PHYSICAL
THREATS.

723
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,699
THAT'S WHERE I AM.

724
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:36,496
YOU ASKED ME WHERE I STOOD AMONG
THIS GROUP, AND I WAS HONEST.

725
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:40,416
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER, FOOTBALL
ANALOGY, AN AUDIBLE, PERHAPS A

726
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,834
CHANGE OF PLAN?

727
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:46,130
>> POTENTIALLY, ALL THEY CAME IN
LOCK, STOCK, BARREL ON THEIR

728
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,256
ORIGINAL PLAN.

729
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,384
>> Jeff: AUBRY, THIS IS
BECOMING ROUTINE AT TRIBAL WHERE

730
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,428
YOU COME WITH A PLAN, BUT IT
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S LOCKED IN.

731
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,431
>> I FEEL LIKE I JUST SHOWED UP
AT THE WRONG WEDDING OR

732
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,224
SOMETHING.

733
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:02,397
>> Jeff: EVERYONE IS STILL
TALKING.

734
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,232
>> DO YOU THINK THEY JUST
SWITCHED?

735
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,692
>> GUYS, NO CONFUSION.

736
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,234
>> NO CONFUSION.

737
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,403
JUST STAY.

738
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,237
>> OKAY.

739
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,697
>> STAY TO THE ORIGINAL PLAN.

740
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,240
>> ORIGINAL PLAN.

741
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,575
STICK TO THE PLAN.

742
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,077
>> STICK WITH THE PLAN.

743
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,622
STICK WITH THE PLAN.

744
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,083
>> Jeff: WOW.

745
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,211
SIERRA, YOU LOOK LIKE A DEER IN
THE HEADLIGHTS.

746
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:29,340
>> I WILL SAY ONE THING, JUST TO
SAVE MY OWN ASS, IF WE'RE

747
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,259
PLAYING THIS GAME THE WAY WE
STARTED, WE NEED TO CONTINUE

748
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:45,481
WITH THAT.

749
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,316
IF THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE.

750
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,823
>> Jeff: WOW.

751
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:55,450
>> SWEAR?

752
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,117
>> SWEAR.

753
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,161
>> IT'S ON YOU.

754
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,328
>> HOW YOU DOING?

755
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,330
>> I'M SCARED.

756
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:07,128
>> I WET MYSELF.

757
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,506
>> WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
HERE, JEFF.

758
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,924
>> LAST CHANCE.

759
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,341
TELL ME.

760
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:17,597
>> OH, MY GOSH.

761
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,811
>> THEY HAVE AN IDOL.

762
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,274
>> OKAY.

763
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,318
ARE WE STAYING?

764
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,778
SHOULD WE CHANGE IT TO BRAD.

765
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,155
I JUST TOLD BRAD ABOUT THE IDOL.

766
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,323
>> ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT YOU?

767
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,825
>> Jeff: UNPRECEDENTED.

768
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,954
>> HE'S GETTING NERVOUS.

769
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,664
>> WHERE ARE THEY GOING?

770
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,669
ARE THEY TRYING TO CHANGE
EVERYTHING?

771
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,799
>> Jeff: NOW I'M THE ONE WHO
IS SPEECHLESS.

772
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,591
>> OKAY.

773
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,177
>> Jeff: AUBRY, WHAT JUST
HAPPENED?

774
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,642
IT WAS AS IF AN ENERGY FORCE
RIPPED THROUGH TRIBAL.

775
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,354
>> IT'S LIKE A BUNCH OF CARRIER
PIGEONS WERE GOING BACK AND

776
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,856
FORTH, OLD LINE, NEW LINES
STARTED CROSSING AND SHARING

777
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,357
INFORMATION.

778
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,525
IT'S STILL HAPPENING.

779
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,401
>> Jeff: I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT AND IT'S NOW

780
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,528
ROUND TWO.

781
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,404
>> Jeff: I THINK YOU JUST HAVE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE PERSONAL

782
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,242
RELATIONSHIPS WHO NEED TO
REALIZE THEY'RE PLAYING WITH A

783
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,245
TEAM RIGHT NOW.

784
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,204
BUT WE'RE GOOD.

785
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,665
>> NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

786
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,416
WE'RE JUST AM OKAY.

787
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,168
SOME SIDE NOTES.

788
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,169
>> Jeff: WOW.

789
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,504
ARE YOU GUYS READY TO VOTE?

790
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,797
I DON'T WANT TO BREAK THIS UP.

791
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,714
>> YES.

792
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,090
WE'RE READY.

793
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:34,757
>> WE'RE GOOD.

794
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,383
>> WE BETTER HUP.

795
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,343
>> LET'S DO IT.

796
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,095
>> Jeff: WE'RE READY.

797
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,137
ALL RIGHT.

798
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:44,225
IT IS AS THE CONVERSATIONS
CONTINUE, TIME TO VOTE.

799
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,562
HALI, YOU'RE UP.

800
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,941
>> I DIDN'T CONSENT.

801
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,776
>> Jeff: YOU'RE NOT READY?

802
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,736
>> Jeff: HALLIE, WE CAN VOTE.

803
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,113
>> ALL RIGHT.

804
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:02,410
YOU MAY REGRET IT, BUT I'LL GO.

805
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,704
>> Jeff: TIME TO VOTE.

806
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:13,421
HALI'S UP.

807
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,423
>> WHO HAS THE IDOL?

808
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:22,263
>> NOBODY HAS NO IDOL OVER
THERE.

809
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:32,356
>> BEST PLAYER HERE, GOT TO SEND
YOU HOME.

810
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:42,617
>> BEST PLAYER HERE, GOT TO SEND
YOU HOME.

811
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:52,293
>> IF YOU PULL OUT AN IDOL, I
WILL SOIL MYSELF.

812
00:36:52,376 --> 00:37:01,093
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

813
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,639
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

814
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,976
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

815
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,518
>> DO IT.

816
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,269
DO IT.

817
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:10,561
DO IT.

818
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,812
>> YES.

819
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,441
>> JEFF.

820
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:19,362
I FOUND SOMETHING THIS
AFTERNOON, A LITTLE NECKLACE.

821
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:27,119
I THINK I'M GOING TO GIVE IT
TO... WHAT WANTS IT?

822
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:27,828
PRETTY LADY.

823
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,333
HERE YOU ARE.

824
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,961
>> I'D LOVE TO WEAR IT.

825
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,003
>> THANKS, SIERRA.

826
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:43,302
>> THANK YOU.

827
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,720
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

828
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,349
ANY VOTES CAST FOR SIERRA WILL
NOT COUNT.

829
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:53,521
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

830
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,566
FIRST VOTE SIERRA.

831
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,319
DUDS NOT COUNT.

832
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,738
>> GOOD JOB.

833
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,365
>> Jeff: SIERRA.

834
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,118
DUDS IN NOT COUNT.

835
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,371
SIERRA, DOES NOT COUNT.

836
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,163
SIERRA.

837
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,875
DOES NOT COUNT.

838
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,334
SIERRA.

839
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:22,550
DOES NOT COUNT.

840
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:22,967
SIERRA.

841
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:34,854
DOES NOT COUNT.

842
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,564
MALCOLM.

843
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,400
ONE VOTE MALCOLM.

844
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:44,530
>> HOLY HELL.

845
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,406
MALCOLM.

846
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,532
THAT'S TWO VOTES MALCOLM.

847
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:50,202
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

848
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:56,542
>> YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

849
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,586
>> Jeff: FOURTH PERSON VOTED
OUT OF "SURVIVOR: GAME

850
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,754
CHANGERS," MALCOLM.

851
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,215
THAT'S THREE, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

852
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:17,605
>> I'M GOING TO VOMIT.

853
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:22,610
>> Jeff: MALL COME, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

854
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:34,163
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

855
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:38,125
WELL, TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL
IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF WHY

856
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:44,256
"SURVIVOR" IS STILL SO
ENTERTAINING AND DEF --

857
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,802
DEVASTATING, BECAUSE NO MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES YOU PLAY, NO

858
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,305
MATTER HOW CERTAIN YOU ARE, THE
GAME CAN STILL SMACK YOU IN THE

859
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:52,098
FACE.

860
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,974
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

861
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,059
GOOD NIGHT.
