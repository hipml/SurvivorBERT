00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,137
I'm happy to see everybody.

3
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:15,758
- Yeah, let me... Yeah.
- Here.

4
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:16,896
Bring it.

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,275
Going into Tribal,

6
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,862
I thought
I was not gonna make it.

7
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:25,034
Like, I thought,
this is it for me, you know?

8
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:27,655
There were only
five of us voting,

9
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:31,896
and it's either Matt or me
because Ratu is all together.

10
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:36,275
Then Heidi has this advantage
that she can control that vote.

11
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:38,379
I'm going to take Lauren's vote,

12
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:41,310
and I want Lauren
to vote for Yam Yam.

13
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:43,862
YAM YAM: Luckily, her
advantage didn't change the vote,

14
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:46,034
and Matt went home.

15
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:48,034
Matt, the tribe has spoken.

16
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:51,413
And I'm still here.

17
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:53,793
Thank you. Yeah.

18
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:58,034
I know.

19
00:00:58,137 --> 00:00:59,475
YAM YAM:
As of right now, I've been

20
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,482
at every Tribal Council
except two of them,

21
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,862
and I've survived all of them.

22
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:06,413
I guess I'm that cat
with nine lives, you know?

23
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:08,095
CAROLYN: It would
have been hard either way.

24
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:09,889
I would have cried. If I were
you, I would have cried.

25
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,475
- FRANNIE: Yeah.
- That's how I felt at Tribal.

26
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:13,475
- YAM YAM: It was a very emotional Tribal.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:16,931
Worst possible outcome happened
at Tribal Council.

28
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,068
Matt, my best friend out here

29
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:21,551
and my closest ally
in this game, got voted out.

30
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:23,344
And...

31
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:27,689
now that he's gone,
I feel like I've been marooned

32
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:30,620
with nothing all over again.

33
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,758
Oh, I know.

34
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:37,000
FRANNIE:
I feel like Matt felt like

35
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:39,344
home to me here.

36
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:43,793
[crying]:
And to watch him at Tribal,

37
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,137
and see...

38
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:49,551
how... scared he was,

39
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:52,241
and how alone he felt

40
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:55,103
and to watch him go
and to know that

41
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:58,103
that's now how I'm feeling...

42
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,172
It was so hard.

43
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,931
That's exactly...

44
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:06,448
I know.

45
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,172
We have to, so...

46
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,448
Yeah.

47
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,034
BRANDON:
We voted Matt out because

48
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:18,344
we know that him and Frannie
are very close, and

49
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:20,026
that was something
we wanted to break apart.

50
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:21,965
We wanted to take another person
away from Soka

51
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:23,716
so that we could have control
of the numbers

52
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:25,206
in our-in our own way.

53
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,448
- HEIDI: Here is the thing.
- YAM YAM: Mm-hmm.

54
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:30,241
- I wasn't gonna steal yours.
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:31,689
I wasn't gonna steal Matt's.

56
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:34,241
- Mm-hmm.
- So, my only thing was,

57
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:36,172
how can I not ruffle feathers

58
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:39,241
- too much with Ratu?
- Yeah.

59
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,034
And it was clear
from everything they said,

60
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,724
they were going for Matty.

61
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:45,379
Sitting there
at the Tribal Council, I knew

62
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:48,137
I had my advantage, and I knew

63
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,517
I couldn't change the outcome
of what was happening.

64
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,103
So, I tried
to use it the best way

65
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,034
without making
too many enemies, and

66
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:59,344
I could use Yam Yam's number.

67
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:01,896
So I had to really try
to gain some trust with him.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,310
In my head, I was like,

69
00:03:03,413 --> 00:03:04,992
"I'm gonna steal Lauren's
'cause she has two."

70
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:07,620
- Mm-hmm.
- If their plan is something different,

71
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:10,000
- she can use her second one.
- A second. A second.

72
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:11,413
HEIDI: Right now,

73
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:13,724
there's three Tika, three Soka,

74
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,241
but there's four Ratu
with a lot of currency.

75
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:20,655
We all know
that Lauren has an extra vote,

76
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:24,000
and there's a rumor
that Jaime has an idol.

77
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,034
Kane is very strategic
and very smart,

78
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:29,000
and Brandon
is a physical threat.

79
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,896
So, they are very strong.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,034
I think us, the misfits, -Yeah.

81
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:35,689
Have to come up with
a plan to survive, -Yeah.

82
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:37,793
Because they're gonna start
picking us one by one.

83
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:40,310
- YAM YAM: Yeah.
- HEIDI: So I'm gonna need to pair up

84
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:42,620
with you, Carolyn, -Mm-hmm.

85
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,758
You know, Carson, -Mm-hmm.

86
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:46,130
- In some capacity.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

87
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,965
Tonight,

88
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,793
I really for sure thought
I was going home,

89
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,758
but now the game is changing,

90
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:54,025
and the Tika three...
Carolyn, Carson

91
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,793
and I... are in the middle.

92
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:57,482
Everybody wants our votes.

93
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:01,000
CARSON: I know.

94
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,689
Yeah.

95
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:08,482
There's definitely a war
between Soka and Ratu.

96
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:10,551
Tika members
are the Three Stooges.

97
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:12,689
Nobody thinks
we're the strategists here.

98
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:14,344
Nobody thinks
we're the power players.

99
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,827
- Totally. Me too. Exactly.
- Okay.

100
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,405
- And keep them against each other.
- Mm-hmm.

101
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:22,751
That's exactly
what we need to do.

102
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:24,931
At this point, Soka

103
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:28,275
and Ratu are underestimating
the Tika Three.

104
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,620
They're continuing to battle
against each other, and

105
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:34,827
that puts Tika
in a very powerful position.

106
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,517
Oh, geez.

107
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,095
Feel like I was definitely
on the outs

108
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:45,448
when I first got here, but now,

109
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,137
we're in that good
middle position, and

110
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:51,379
I'm gonna keep trying
to just be underestimated

111
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:54,931
and looked at like I am
just the turkey of the tribe.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,689
- Figure it out, yeah.
- You know?

113
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:02,068
KANE: Right now, my
Ratu members are strong,

114
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:04,689
and seems like
we have a good relationship

115
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:06,551
with the Tika Three.

116
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:09,482
So, this game is just
wide open for us now.

117
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:16,724
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Um, yeah.

118
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:18,026
You know,
my slogan coming out here was,

119
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,241
"Don't get cocky, kid,"

120
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:20,682
because that's when
bad things happen.

121
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,379
But it's really hard right now.

122
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:24,275
It is our game to lose.

123
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,517
If it is not a Ratu member
who wins this game,

124
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,000
we messed that up.

125
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,275
Ooh. Those look good. Dang!

126
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you so much, Carolyn.
This is really good.

127
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,095
- Yeah, for real.
- CAROLYN: Yeah, team effort, for real.

128
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,034
- DANNY: Are they dead?
- CAROLYN: Yeah.

129
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:58,000
They've been boiling
for a while.

130
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,724
CAROLYN:
Those are good. Those are, like,

131
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,509
- bright red, though, right?
- HEIDI: Yeah, they look good.

132
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,448
FRANNIE: Yeah. The lemon is...

133
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:05,793
CAROLYN: But, like,
you got to have the lemon.

134
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:07,302
- HEIDI: I agree.
- CAROLYN: You have to.

135
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:08,724
HEIDI:
You make them even better.

136
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,931
[retching]

137
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:14,172
Is he okay? Was he throwing up?

138
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:17,103
CARSON:
This morning, I wake up, and

139
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:19,206
my stomach is just churning,

140
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,655
and I just have to throw up,
like, in the bushes.

141
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,862
It's, like, the reward

142
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:28,758
of the peanut butter-jellies
yesterday came with a curse,

143
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:30,965
and I just get sick.

144
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:33,130
I feel bad 'cause I'm, like,
I feel like people think...

145
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:35,310
No, they all know. Everyone
knows this is not like you

146
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:37,931
to, like, be over here saying
that you're not feeling well.

147
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,965
Don't even...
Everyone loves you,

148
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:41,827
and they're worried about you.

149
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:45,724
This isn't like you, so just
chill. You're good, Carson.

150
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,137
CARSON:
Coming out onSurvivor, I knew

151
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,413
there was going to be,
like, terrible days, but

152
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:54,448
this is definitely a low for me,

153
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:58,137
[voice breaking]: And I'm just
trying to push through.

154
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:01,068
JAIME:
Okay, so we got some tree mail.

155
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,931
[all cheering, exclaiming]

156
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:07,413
Let's see what it says. Okay.

157
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:10,551
"Today there
is only one necklace..."

158
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:18,172
Oh.

159
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:21,344
- FRANNIE: Oh.
- Wow.

160
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:24,344
It sounds like we are, yeah.

161
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:26,026
Heidi, how do you feel
about us as a pair?

162
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,275
- I'm... I love it.
- Okay.

163
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,199
- Let's do it. I have no idea what it is.
- Yeah, yeah.

164
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,793
FRANNIE: So we get a tree
mail that says that there's going

165
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:34,862
to be some sort
of an immunity challenge today.

166
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:38,413
But before leaving camp,
we have to divide into pairs.

167
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:39,785
I don't mind.
I just feel horrible

168
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,344
for whoever is paired with me.

169
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:43,827
CAROLYN: I'll be with
Carson. I'll carry him on my back.

170
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,172
HEIDI: You okay with that?

171
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,241
Yes, abso... I'm with Carson.

172
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:49,413
FRANNIE: Where things
get tricky is, we don't know

173
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:51,517
if these pairs

174
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,931
are duos that will
compete together,

175
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,724
or that will compete
against each other.

176
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:58,275
LAUREN: It's us four right here.

177
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,517
It's us four. We got to pick,
so I really don't care.

178
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,413
I just know I'm gonna be the
weaker link, so...

179
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,413
I am so worried because

180
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:08,137
my energy is low.

181
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,862
I haven't been eating.

182
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,965
So I know nobody

183
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:14,000
is going to want
to work with me.

184
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:18,199
- And that means we're together, Danny.
- DANNY: Yeah.

185
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:20,620
LAUREN: So I feel great going
into the challenge with Danny.

186
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:23,724
He may not feel as great going
into the challenge with me.

187
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:25,517
- All right, you good with that?
- 100%.

188
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,862
- All right, cool.
- Yeah.

189
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,482
- Good.
- Yeah.

190
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:31,448
DANNY: I wind up getting stuck
with Lauren. Yesterday,

191
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,724
I was saying, "Hey, man,
let's-let's vote out Lauren."

192
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,853
You know, that's the beauty of
Survivor, man. You guys are...

193
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,889
You're gunning for each other
one moment, next moment,

194
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:40,344
you're brothers and sisters
in arms, but

195
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:42,288
I mean, I'm still saying
let's vote out Lauren.

196
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:01,206
Come on in.

197
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:05,862
♪ ♪

198
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:10,551
Day 15.

199
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,965
Eight people gone
from this game.

200
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,586
You are all still here.

201
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,172
All right, let's get
to today's immunity challenge.

202
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:19,517
First things first.

203
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,206
Got to take back the necklaces.

204
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,517
- Thank you.
- Sir.

205
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,482
Thank you.

206
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:32,344
Once again, immunity is back
up for grabs.

207
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,068
All right,
this morning in tree mail,

208
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,241
you were instructed
to divide into pairs.

209
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:38,241
- Kane, how did that go?
- So when I first saw.

210
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,310
"Divide into pairs,"
I had a little bit of, like,

211
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,724
immediate anxiety, like,
I was back in high school,

212
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:44,785
and it was just gonna be
a scramble for desk buddies.

213
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:47,000
But I think everyone kind...
We were all in a group.

214
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:49,034
Everyone just kind of
took a second,

215
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:51,034
made eyes,
and we split into groups, so...

216
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:52,482
The-the big variable was Carson

217
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:54,379
'cause he's not
feeling well today.

218
00:09:54,482 --> 00:09:56,448
- Carson, what's going on with you?
- Well,

219
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,448
I was sleeping,
and then all of a sudden, like,

220
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:01,241
throughout the night,
I just woke up

221
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:04,793
and had to go and go in
the bushes and throw up, and,

222
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,068
um, and so I did that
about eight more times.

223
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:08,931
I don't know
where that came from.

224
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:11,758
It was one of the worst nights
I've ever had in my life.

225
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,241
And so, this morning, there was
a lot of talk about, like,

226
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:16,704
"Well, who's gonna be
with Carson?"

227
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:20,275
Um, and so, it was just
really amazing to see

228
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:21,793
everyone around me.

229
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:24,620
They were pretty much all
willing to be a pair with me.

230
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,413
And so, that was a really,
like, heartwarming feeling.

231
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:30,793
All right,
so let's get into pairs.

232
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,000
Let me see what happened.

233
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:34,068
[laughing]

234
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:35,413
LAUREN: I'll scoot down.

235
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:37,000
PROBST:
So we've got Kane and Brandon,

236
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,482
Frannie and Yam Yam,

237
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,034
Carolyn with Carson,

238
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:42,172
Danny and Lauren,

239
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,137
and Heidi and Jaime.

240
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,586
All right, let's get
to today's challenge.

241
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,689
Today's challenge
is gonna move quickly.

242
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:51,310
It's gonna run in three stages.

243
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,793
Players will be eliminated

244
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:55,758
in each stage.

245
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,310
So, in order
to make the next stage,

246
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:58,758
you got to make the cut.

247
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:01,000
Here's how it works.
For the first stage,

248
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:03,068
you're gonna crawl,
one person at a time,

249
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,586
through a twisted, muddy net.

250
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:08,241
Then dig up planks,
race back to your mat.

251
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:10,551
First four pairs

252
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:13,620
to get back to their mat
and plant their flag

253
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,137
move on to the next round.

254
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,586
The last pair is out. That's it.

255
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,034
No shot at immunity.
For the next stage,

256
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,137
you'll race up a cargo net

257
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:25,896
and use those planks
to cross a rope bridge.

258
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,965
You got to get both players
and all three planks

259
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:29,689
to the other side.
Then you slide

260
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:31,241
down the wall, race to your mat.

261
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:33,241
The first two pairs

262
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:35,896
to finish move on
to the final round.

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,965
The last two pairs... you're out.

264
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:39,655
No shot at immunity.

265
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:41,827
For the final round,
pairs are gone.

266
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:44,034
It will now be four individuals.

267
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,689
You will use your arms
to brace against two walls

268
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:50,241
while your feet are perched
on narrow footholds.

269
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:51,827
It's painful.

270
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:54,206
When you drop, you're out.

271
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,517
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

272
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,965
guaranteed a spot
in the final nine.

273
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:02,206
Losers... Tribal Council,
where somebody

274
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,241
will be the ninth person
voted out

275
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:07,137
and the second member
of our jury.

276
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:10,103
All right, let's draw for spots.

277
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:11,931
Get it on.

278
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,137
Here we go.

279
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,517
Stage one... for immunity.

280
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,896
Four pairs will move on.

281
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,620
The last pair is out.

282
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,758
Survivors ready?

283
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,344
Go! Gonna be Carolyn,
Yam Yam, Kane, Jaime

284
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:38,275
and Danny.
Danny whipping through it.

285
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,482
- LAUREN: Good job, Danny.
- But now you hit the twist.

286
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:42,946
Push, push, push.
You got it, girl.

287
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,302
- Breathe.
- BRANDON: Keep going, Kane.

288
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:45,793
LAUREN: You've got this, Danny.

289
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:48,068
FRANNIE: You got it, Yam
Yam. You've got it. Stay calm.

290
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:50,212
- This is tougher than it looks.
- [Carolyn screams]

291
00:12:50,862 --> 00:12:52,275
Oh, my God!

292
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,103
Carolyn, you're doing great.

293
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,586
[yelling]

294
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:57,337
PROBST: You've got to
get through the twisted net.

295
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,896
Ow!

296
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,103
And it will stay twisted
for the next person.

297
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,413
- Yeah, uh-huh, that's the right way.
- [Carolyn yells]

298
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,578
Carson trying to help. Doesn't
even have a voice to yell.

299
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,310
[Carolyn yells]

300
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,965
- CARSON: Good job, Carolyn.
- [yelling]

301
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,164
HEIDI:
You got to keep rolling, baby.

302
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:12,310
LAUREN: Keep it up, Danny.

303
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:14,551
Danny is really fighting it.

304
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,275
Danny is making his way.

305
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,310
Danny's gonna be
first through. Get to the mat.

306
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,647
- You're good. Go, Lauren.
- Let's go, baby. - [Lauren yells]

307
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:23,068
PROBST: It is Danny
through. Here comes Lauren.

308
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,448
FRANNIE: Good, Yam Yam. Yes.

309
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:28,896
Yam Yam doing a nice job.
He knew how to get through this.

310
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,517
He twisted his body.
You're good, Frannie. Go.

311
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,862
- [whooping]
- PROBST: Kane is through.

312
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:37,000
- Brandon's now on.
- [whooping]

313
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:41,068
PROBST: Jaime's stuck.

314
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:42,551
It looks so simple.

315
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,103
"I'll just whip through that."
No.

316
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:47,862
- You got to work.
- You got it, girl.

317
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:50,137
- PROBST: Carolyn is all knotted up.
- [yelling]

318
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:52,413
She's been in the same spot.

319
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:54,655
You got to twist
to get through this.

320
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,068
Oh, my God.

321
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,647
You got it, Carolyn.
Don't worry about it.

322
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,034
[Carolyn yells]

323
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:01,931
Frannie's through.

324
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,586
- Go. Start digging.
- There you go. You're through.

325
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:06,578
- You're through. You're through.
- Brandon is through.

326
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,310
- You're good. Start digging.
- Thank you.

327
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,448
- [whooping]
- Yes.

328
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:12,000
You're looking for planks.

329
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,000
HEIDI: Don't stop. Don't stop.

330
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,463
PROBST:
Jaime's fighting, twisting.

331
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:19,931
Oh, my God.

332
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:22,655
- Jaime is finally through.
- HEIDI: Yes, yes.

333
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:24,000
Go, Heidi.

334
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,137
- It's now Heidi working.
- You got it, Heidi.

335
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,137
DANNY: You got it.
Come on. You're right there.

336
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,682
- Look at that, Lauren. That's how you do it.
- Let's go.

337
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:32,034
Let's go. Let's go, girl.
Let's go. Let's go.

338
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,310
- You're good. Start digging.
- CAROLYN: Oh, my God.

339
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:36,241
We've got three pairs

340
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:39,827
that are looking very good.
We're looking for one more.

341
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:41,620
[yelling]

342
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:44,655

You're no longer pairs.

Everybody move up
into that first position.

448
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,164
You can use the footholds
to get up there.

449
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:04,486
You're going
to the highest part.

450
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:08,344
It's been a fast transition
from stage one

451

460
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:36,586
It is going to hurt.

461
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:39,689
Every time you move down,

462
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:42,241
that foothold gets more narrow.

463
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,448
Puts more pressure on your foot.

464
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:49,862
Then you start relying a
little more on your upper body.

465
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,758
At a certain point, you go numb.

One minute left in this round.

467

So just start thinking how
you're gonna transition down,

00:22:05,103 --> 00:22:06,482
Huge effort.

516
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,482
We are down to three.
It is Danny,

517
00:22:08,586 --> 00:22:10,827
- Lauren and Brandon.
- [overlapping chatter]

518
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:13,965
Kane, when you can,
wobble over to the bench.

519
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,724
Nothing about that feels good.

520
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:18,482
- CAROLYN: Love your hair like that.
- Good job.

521
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:20,827
PROBST:
Brandon's former partner is out.

522
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:22,896
Like so many
endurance challenges,

523
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,896
this will end
when somebody just drops.

524
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,310
It'll probably be sudden.

525
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:31,310
FRANNIE: Y'all got it.

526
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:35,482
PROBST: Brandon drops. He can't

527
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:36,889
- take it anymore.
- Good job, Brandon.

528
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:38,965
And we are down to two.
We got a showdown,

529
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:41,517
- and they're side by side.
- FRANNIE: Good job, Brandon.

530
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,620
PROBST: Danny and
Lauren were former partners

531
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:47,068
that relied on each other
to get to this spot.

532
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:49,000
And just like in the game,
you now got

533
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:50,793
to outlast the other.

534
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:54,655
One of you is gonna wear that
necklace tonight.

535
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,724
Don't lose your focus.

536
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:00,689
Channel whatever you need to.

537
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,896
Jeff?

538
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,586
Danny.

539
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:07,103
[passes wind squeakily]

540
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:09,172
[laughter]

541
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:10,931
PROBST: That was nice.

542
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:12,103
Well timed.

543
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:14,620
[laughing]

544
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:16,379
So glad I'm not up there.

545
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,206
[laughs]

546
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:23,344
It is Danny and Lauren

547
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:28,034
in a three-stage,
single-day challenge.

548
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:30,034
And it shows in their bodies,
in their faces,

549
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:31,482
in their expressions.

550
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:33,827
Covered in mud, exhausted.

551
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,137
But with that necklace, boy,
will you sleep well tonight.

552
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:43,931
All right, we're gonna make
our move to that final stage.

553
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:45,827
Before you move,
let me remind you,

554
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:48,379
it is a live transition.

555
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:50,862
That foothold is so narrow

556
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:53,344
that it's barely enough

557
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,344
for your foot
to get any kind of an edge.

558
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:57,095
- HEIDI: You guys are looking great.
- [whooping]

559
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:59,068
PROBST: It could be over fast.

560
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:01,689
You might only need
to be up there ten seconds,

561
00:24:01,793 --> 00:24:04,000
so lock into it.

562
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:06,793
Your time starts now.

563
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:08,379
Start making your move.

564
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,689
- YAM YAM: Take your time.
- PROBST: This is it.

565
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:12,544
You've got to successfully
make the transition.

566
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,310
HEIDI: You got to make it.

567
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,000
PROBST: There goes Lauren.

568
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:18,551
- There goes Danny.
- CARSON: You got it.

569
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:20,682
- PROBST: You're both doing great.
- YAM YAM: Good job, good job.

570
00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:22,620
You've both done it.
You're good.

571
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:23,992
- [cheering, whooping]
- We're into

572
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,586
the final stage
of this challenge.

573
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:28,793
Now you got to dig.
You've really got to dig.

574
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:30,578
- This hurts.
- YAM YAM: Don't think about the pain.

575
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,482
There's nowhere for your foot.
That is a sliver of wood.

576
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:36,482
Keep fighting. Keep fighting.

577
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:38,751
- YAM YAM: Keep it. You got it.
- PROBST: Whatever it takes.

578
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:40,241
What are you trying to prove

579
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:41,647
- to yourself?
- YAM YAM: Keep going.

580
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,413
PROBST: What do you
want your kids to see?

581
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:45,551
- HEIDI: You're so strong.
- YAM YAM: Yes.

582
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:49,164
- PROBST: Danny drops.
- [Lauren yelling]

583
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:52,034
Lauren wins individual immunity.

584
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:56,103
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- Unbelievable performance.

585
00:24:56,206 --> 00:25:00,241
Once again, Survivorsurprises.

586
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:02,034
You freaking did it.

587
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:03,827
HEIDI: That was amazing.

588
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:06,241
That was freaking awesome.

589
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:09,172
My kids are gonna be so proud.

590
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,344
My kids at school
and my own kids.

591
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:13,310
Like, that was freaking awesome.

592
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:15,103
- Lauren, come over here.
- [whooping]

593
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:17,482
Wow. Right here.

594
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:20,586
- Unbelievable performance.
- Unbelievable.

595
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:24,103
- PROBST: You surprised yourself?
- LAUREN: Yes. That's...

596
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:27,034
Um, I never thought
I would win any immunity, so,

597
00:25:27,137 --> 00:25:29,137
it's so cool. Like,

598
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,509
this is, like,
a bucket list item,

599
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:32,448
and it's the coolest thing ever.

600
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,268
- Lauren, you are safe.
- I want Jeff to give me a hug.

601
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,103
I'll give you a hug. Well, both.
Let me put this on.

602
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:39,862
Now I'll give you a hug.

603
00:25:39,965 --> 00:25:42,827
- All the mud... you can take it off, Jeff.
- I'll take it all.

604
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:44,199
I love being a part
of these moments.

605
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,793
- Yay!
- Where are you going?

606
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:47,923
- I want...
- I don't know. I don't know what to do.

607
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,655
I'm like, "Aah!"

608
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,586
- I don't know. I'm excited.
- PROBST: Lauren, guaranteed

609
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:54,379
a spot in the final nine.

610
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:55,931
You'll live to see day 16.

611
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,620
You are not going home.

612
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,862
As for the rest of you,

613
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:02,034
after 15 days, somebody will be

614
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:05,068
the ninth person
voted out of Survivor44,

615
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:07,034
become the second member
of our jury.

616
00:26:07,137 --> 00:26:09,302
Grab your stuff, head out. See
you tonight at Tribal Council.

617
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:10,889
- Congrats. - Thank you.
- YAM YAM: Good job.

618
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:12,586
DANNY: I probably
would have been gunning

619
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:15,172
for Lauren if she didn't win,
but she took the whole thing,

620
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:16,551
beat my ass.

621
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:18,241
So, I have to change my plans,

622
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,344
and the logical decision is

623
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,793
we need to take someone
from Ratu out.

624
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:24,613
They're running away
with the game right now.

625
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:26,344
If somebody doesn't make
a move now,

626
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:29,241
this game's gonna play you,
and you got to play the game.

627
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,164
- CARSON: Great job, Lauren.
- CAROLYN: Good job, girl.

628
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:38,965
DANNY: Yeah, the boys are gonna
be proud of you, Lauren.

629
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:42,344
[indistinct, quiet chatter]

630
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:46,034
HEIDI: It's like brown spots
around every single one of us.

631
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,544
- BRANDON: I got so many cuts on my body now.
- Oh, man, my...

632
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:49,820
My body's stinging
from this all getting

633
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:51,586
in my little cuts that I got.

634
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:54,206
YAM YAM: We get back to camp
muddy as hell, and everybody's,

635
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,241
like, trying
to do a little small talk, but

636
00:26:56,344 --> 00:26:58,206
everybody's, like,
giving eyes to each other.

637
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,854
Like, "Well,
who are we gonna vote for?"

638
00:26:59,896 --> 00:27:02,103
Nobody's looking at me.
I'm worried again.

639
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,448
Oh, my God. Here we go again.

640
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:05,931
Another Tribal Council
with no immunity.

641
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,586
BRANDON: Ratu right
now... we have the numbers.

642
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:22,379
Me, Jaime, Lauren,

643
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:25,379
Kane and Carson.

644
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:27,162
We are strong right now,
and we are kind of

645
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:28,889
dictating the way
this game is being played.

646
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:30,896
So...

647
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,551
- Yup.
- BRANDON: I like that, yeah.

648
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:42,689
We decide that we want to put
Frannie, so we're just trying

649
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:43,833
to check all of our boxes.

650
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:48,241
- No.
- No, we're not.

651
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:51,509
Looking right at you.
No, we're not going for you.

652
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:52,689
Okay.

653
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:56,337
BRANDON: Carolyn and
Yam Yam are definitely numbers

654
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:57,965
to help us, and I feel like.

655
00:27:58,068 --> 00:27:59,965
Carolyn is gonna go wherever
Yam Yam goes.

656
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:01,862
And right, now Yam Yam,

657
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:03,785
I would hope, feels some sort
of allegiance to us

658
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:05,061
since we've kept him
in this game.

659
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:06,583
What are you...
what are you thinking?

660
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:11,413
I am down with whatever name
you guys tell me, you know?

661
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:14,000
DANNY: Okay.

662
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:16,862
Yeah. I'm... I'm cool...
I'm cool with that.

663
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:21,233
BRANDON:
I feel like everybody's kind of

664
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:22,175
all-in on Frannie.

665
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:24,206
She's very intelligent.

666
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,586
She's a very strong
physical player.

667
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:29,275
So, it would just make sense
to get her out of the game, and

668
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:31,779
that's just another threat that
we don't have to worry about.

669
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:39,448
- This is our only shot.
- Yeah.

670
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,068
Like, we have
to go hard or go home.

671
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:42,785
Yeah, that's what I feel
right now. And now I'm gonna...

672
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:44,854
So, it has to be the three of us
with the three of Tika.

673
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:49,275
Ratu's plan is to convince
everyone to vote Frannie.

674
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,275
I thought about it.
I considered it,

675
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,103
but this is the time for me

676
00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:54,655
to try to make my own plan

677
00:28:54,758 --> 00:28:57,448
because we have three Soka
and three Tika.

678
00:28:57,551 --> 00:28:58,931
Six is better than their four.

679
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:01,413
If we stick together
with numbers,

680
00:29:01,517 --> 00:29:03,199
then we have the power
to vote someone else.

681
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,896
I know you like Brandon, but

682
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,360
- he's probably the most dangerous.
- No, no, no. I'm... No.

683
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:10,655
- I knew it.
- So...

684
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:17,482
Okay. Yam Yam is the biggest
person that we need to convince.

685
00:29:17,586 --> 00:29:19,896
We are going to try it because

686
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,103
if we're gonna go out
this game, we're gonna

687
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:25,758
go out swinging,
but it has to be a blindside.

688
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:28,000
This is a fake one.
You have to understand this.

689
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,931
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

690
00:29:34,034 --> 00:29:35,827
If the three of you,
with Carson,

691
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:38,310
and the three of us,
there's six of us.

692
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:40,551
We can take one of them out.

693
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:44,068
We will be stupid
not doing that now.

694
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:45,379
Who...?

695
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:53,000
YAM YAM:
Ratu's trying to stay in power.

696
00:29:53,103 --> 00:29:54,827
Soka is trying to survive.

697
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:57,482
And Tika... we're in the middle,

698
00:29:57,586 --> 00:29:59,103
so everybody wants our votes.

699
00:29:59,206 --> 00:30:02,586
Do we want to win
or do we want to be goats?

700
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,310
Yam Yam,
what do you think about it?

701
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:14,068
I need to talk to Carson
before we go to Tribal

702
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:16,103
because what's gonna

703
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:17,896
dictate the vote is what we do.

704
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:25,000
We don't need to make a move
that's gonna ruin our games.

705
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:28,172
- Okay. Heidi's coming.
- Heidi. Okay. Well, that's fine.

706
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:29,551
YAM YAM: Come, come.

707
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:31,379
CARSON: No, come on, Heidi.

708
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:33,827
We're trying to... I-I think...

709
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:36,310
You feel solid
about this at all?

710
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,103
CARSON:
It's a pretty smart power play.

711
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:39,785
Taking out a Ratu
would make sense because then

712
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,061
it would even the playing field.

713
00:30:41,103 --> 00:30:42,586
But I also have to think about,

714
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:43,854
we don't want to make enemies.

715
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:45,164
- We're just...
- I'm, like, worried.

716
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:47,724
We're-we're worried.
We want this to work.

717
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:50,379
But we just want to make sure
it's going to before we risk...

718
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:55,965
Mm-hmm.

719
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:57,413
I hope it helps us

720
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:59,379
- in some capacity.
- Okay. - Yeah.

721
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:03,206
Apparently,
Danny's the one with the idol.

722
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,820
- CARSON: Yes.
- I didn't know this before.

723
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,622
- Otherwise, I would have told you.
- Mm-hmm.

724
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,931
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Right, right, right.

725
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:12,413
Yeah. Yeah.

726
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:14,034
To convince me to work with her,

727
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:15,577
Heidi told me
that Danny has an idol,

728
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,137
but I'm playing everybody,

729
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:19,724
I'm playing all sides,
I'm playing all options.

730
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:21,586
So, five of us vote Frannie.

731
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:23,586
YAM YAM: And I'm thinking
about approaching Ratu

732
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:26,310
and telling them
that Danny has an idol,

733
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:27,965
and he's gonna play it
for Frannie.

734
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:30,586
After this, I'm gonna be
stronger with you guys.

735
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:34,000
YAM YAM: My game plan
tonight is to get through this vote

736
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:37,482
with all my alliance, and for us
to have options tomorrow.

737
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:47,068
DANNY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

738
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,012
It is you right now,
but, no, we're-we're good.

739
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:50,482
- Okay.
- Okay?

740
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:52,655
So we're gonna
make a big, big move.

741
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:53,854
We'll take out Brandon tonight.

742
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:55,275
Okay? Everybody's...

743
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,061
Everybody's voting...
everybody's gonna be voting you.

744
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:59,586
Mm-hmm.

745
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:01,724
- You have it?
- Yeah.

746
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:05,517
Danny, you're gonna make me cry.

747
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,413
I love this idea
of Danny playing an idol on me,

748
00:32:09,517 --> 00:32:12,310
and I really want to believe
that that will happen.

749
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:15,965
But this whole
Brandon plan falls apart

750
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,655
if just one person

751
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:21,275
doesn't believe
that this six is going to work,

752
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:23,000
then it's completely shot.

753
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:28,931
Okay. No Carolyn?

754
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,482
- I'm open to it, okay?
- Yeah.

755
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:32,509
- You wanted to include Yam Yam in the vote?
- No.

756
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:33,751
Let's keep it small.
Four people.

757
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:35,344
- Okay.
- That way, it won't leak.

758
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:37,968
Okay, but I think Yam Yam knows
the plan. Just letting you know.

759
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:41,724
Yes. Sorry.

760
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,620
Oh. Who-who was it? Heidi?

761
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:46,068
Yeah, but, like...

762
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,958
But Danny, that means that you
just need to play it tonight.

763
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,544
I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go talk to Yam Yam.

764
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:51,068
I'm gonna... I can monitor him.

765
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:54,241
Like, literally, a security
guard. I'm not joking. Um...

766
00:32:58,379 --> 00:32:59,655
I don't think he'll tell them.

767
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:01,206
Ugh!

768
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:05,862
My fear is that Yam Yam
tells Ratu about my plan

769
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:09,172
to take out Brandon and then
they switch to vote to me.

770
00:33:09,275 --> 00:33:12,103
He's a strategic
and smart player, and

771
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:14,344
that is the monkey wrench
in this situation.

772
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:17,137
If I go through with the plan,
I'm playing my idol

773
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:18,724
for Frannie, or maybe

774
00:33:18,827 --> 00:33:20,931
to be safe,
I use it to protect myself.

775
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:23,758
If I could also trust
the Tika tribe is voting

776
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:27,172
with us
and keep the idol in my bag...

777
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:28,965
There's a lot to take in.

778
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:30,578
So, at Tribal Council,
I'm definitely gonna

779
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,862
have my ears wide open

780
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:33,758
because at this point
in the game,

781
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:36,655
it's purely being adaptable,
and I'm ready to be adaptable.

782
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:46,275
♪ ♪

783
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,241
All right.

784
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:06,275
Let's start with where
the game is right now. Kane,

785
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:09,757
the big, obvious difference
is now you have a jury.

786
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:12,551
Yeah, with our
handsome jury member.

787
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:16,206
And it brings another layer
to the game because, I think,

788
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,724
you have
to be playing different,

789
00:34:17,827 --> 00:34:19,655
and you have to be
playing visible so that

790
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,206
people can see
what you're doing.

791
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,206
So I think
there's a lot of people here

792
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,137
who are going to start
skyrocketing their game.

793
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:29,620
Heidi, what's different
about the games for you?

794
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:33,931
Ay. The difference is everyone
is vulnerable except Lauren.

795
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:36,103
And I think before,
it was, like,

796
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:38,172
six and six or five and six.

797
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:40,551
So now, the pool is bigger.

798
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:44,034
So, don't write "Heidi"
on the paper today. Not yet.

799
00:34:44,137 --> 00:34:46,034
That happens at the end.
So I'm just hoping...

800
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:47,757
I'm just hoping I'm on

801
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:49,646
- the right side of the vote.
- PROBST: Carolyn,

802
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,751
it's one thing to say "Be on
the right side of the vote."

803
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:53,655
The question is
what does that really mean?

804
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:55,551
Is it the vote tonight, or is it

805
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,103
a set-up vote
for the next Tribal?

806
00:34:57,206 --> 00:34:58,827
CAROLYN:
And that's the thing. I mean,

807
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:02,241
I think of Lauren and Danny,
and they started out as enemies.

808
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:04,758
And now look at them.
They work together as partners.

809
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:08,103
So everything yesterday
means nothing today.

810
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,482
Nothing ever is certain.

811
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:12,275
PROBST: So, Yam Yam,

812
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:14,000
what is the key to Survivor?

813
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:16,475
Knowing that it could change,
who you're partnered with could

814
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,544
change, who you need to be in
an alliance with could change?

815
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:21,482
Well, the key to Survivoris,

816
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,482
know what's going on,
you know, be aware

817
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:25,379
of what's happening
behind the scenes,

818
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:27,475
and there's people that we like
that we don't need here.

819
00:35:27,517 --> 00:35:28,785
There's people
that we don't like

820
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,344
that we can keep here, you know?

821
00:35:30,448 --> 00:35:33,241
I like all of these,
I like all of these people, so,

822
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:34,758
I'm okay
with keeping all of them.

823
00:35:35,827 --> 00:35:38,000
Heidi, from, like, zero to ten,

824
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:40,758
how much adrenaline
and anxiety was there today?

825
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:42,551
For me, ten.

826
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:44,406
From the moment we finished
the immunity challenge,

827
00:35:44,448 --> 00:35:47,379
I was at a ten,
and I'm still at a ten.

828
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:50,137
Some people may feel more
comfortable than others, but

829
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:53,172
most of us are probably
at a ten right now.

830
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:55,482
Jaime, how you feeling
right now?

831
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:59,275
You always seem positive,
but Heidi said she's at a ten.

832
00:35:59,379 --> 00:36:01,965
- Where are you?
- Yes, I'm at a ten at all times.

833
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:03,724
I just wear it well, so, that...

834
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:05,482
I mean, I don't wear it well.

835
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:07,206
- [laughter]
- Oh!

836
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,647
- YAM YAM: I think you do.
- JAIME: This is my ten face.

837
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:11,103
It's like you have to be

838
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:14,344
on your toes at all times, and
that's what's so fun about it.

839
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:18,344
But it's like if you blink
your eye, something changes.

840
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:21,137
PROBST: Brandon, is that
because you just don't know

841
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:24,000
where your relationships
might end?

842
00:36:24,103 --> 00:36:25,992
Like, tonight might be the night
when I find out,

843
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,551
oh, Iwas the one on the bottom?

844
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:29,889
BRANDON: Yeah. I mean, you
can have a million conversations,

845
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:33,034
but it's always scary
not knowing, you know,

846
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,716
am I on the right side
or am I on the wrong side?

847
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,068
Am I the target
or is somebody else the target?

848
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:38,931
Like, am I being told
the right thing

849
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,827
or am I just being lied
straight to my face

850
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,611
so I feel comfortable
with what's going on?

851
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:44,275
PROBST: So, Lauren,

852
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:46,179
when a vote is happening,
how do you make sure

853
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:49,482
that part of that vote
is your decision so that

854
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:51,000
you're not just a floater?

855
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:54,379
I think really, for tonight,
I can say that

856
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:56,620
it may be a majority vote,

857
00:36:56,724 --> 00:36:58,551
you know, but I'm still thinking
about my game

858
00:36:58,655 --> 00:37:00,379
and thinking about it long-term.

859
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:02,413
PROBST: Danny, a
majority vote is fine so long

860
00:37:02,517 --> 00:37:04,137
as it's the vote you want

861
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:06,862
- to have happen.
- Yeah. Being in, uh... on the wrong side

862
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:09,793
of the majority, uh, in a vote
is never a good thing.

863
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,275
There's something to be said,
though, about being on

864
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,371
the wrong side of the majority,
and then making a comeback,

865
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:17,034
and that's something
that people in the jury

866
00:37:17,137 --> 00:37:19,379
kind of respect, as well.
So when you're out

867
00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:21,517
in this game,
that's just an opportunity.

868
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,965
PROBST: Kane,
regardless how a vote goes,

869
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:27,758
is there always
an opportunity for somebody

870
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:30,241
to make that
part of their résumé?

871
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:33,896
I am always trying to make sure
that I am moving with intention

872
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,482
and that I have an intention
for this vote.

873
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:38,620
So, maybe that intention
is to make a flashy move.

874
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,310
Maybe that intention is

875
00:37:40,413 --> 00:37:42,172
to build trust
with some of my new friends.

876
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,655
So, for me,
that's what the commodity

877
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:46,344
of every single vote is.

878
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:48,206
PROBST:
Frannie, Kane basically said,

879
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,310
you could have
ten different intentions.

880
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah, because we're all,
like, you know, arrows

881
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:56,103
pointing in slightly
different directions,

882
00:37:56,206 --> 00:37:58,586
and we're gonna intersect
tonight, but tomorrow,

883
00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:00,206
we're spread off.

884
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,379
And so, every Tribal is about

885
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:04,282
trying to intersect
as many points as you can,

886
00:38:04,344 --> 00:38:05,896
but you have to figure out

887
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
what direction
everybody's going in if you want

888
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:10,931
- to be on the right page.
- Heidi, you're nodding.

889
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,931
HEIDI:
Yes. At this interception point,

890
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:15,758
some of us will find it,
some of us will not.

891
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:18,000
But the interception point today
will be key,

892
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:20,172
and I think
it will speak very loud

893
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:22,137
about each of our games
at the moment.

894
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:27,068
PROBST: All right, it is

895
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:30,379
time to vote. Kane, you're up.

I'll go tally the votes.

899
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,379
If anybody has an advantage

900
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:27,034
or an idol,
and you want to play it,

901
00:39:27,137 --> 00:39:28,758
now would be the time to do so.

902
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,406
I got something for you, Jeff.

903
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,275

It's being played for Frannie.

907
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:10,241
Any votes for Frannie
will not count.

908
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,758
All right, I'll read the votes.

909
00:40:21,724 --> 00:40:24,034

Two votes, Brandon.

919

Ninth person voted out and
the second member of our jury:

920
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,344
Brandon.
That's three. That's enough.

921
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,568
Need to bring me your torch.

922
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:16,448
Oh.

923
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:28,448
Brandon, the tribe has spoken.

924
00:41:30,413 --> 00:41:32,164
- HEIDI: Good job, Brandon.
- JAIME: Love you, Brandon.

925
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:34,758

927
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:41,655
Grab your torches.

928
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:43,241
Head back to camp. Good night.

929
00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:49,310

KANE: As soon as the move was
made, I wasn't heartbroken.

933
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:12,896
I wasn't betrayed.

934
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,310
I was woken up.

935
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:16,586
PROBST: Next time onSurvivor...

936
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:19,965
DANNY: The shy part
of the game is over.

937
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:21,751
CARSON: The Three
Stooges are running this game.

938
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:24,000
- It's crazy.
- CAROLYN: I want to vote out Danny.

939
00:42:24,103 --> 00:42:25,379
I'm sick of him.

940
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:27,242
YAM YAM: You write my name down,
you're dead.

941
00:42:31,655 --> 00:42:32,958
Clearly, Danny had the idol.
It was a great move.

942
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,413
I can't knock him for it.

943
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:36,157
And I'm not leaving here
with any regrets.

944
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:37,758
I left no stone unturned.

945
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:39,302
I did everything
that I felt that I could

946
00:42:39,344 --> 00:42:41,551
to make myself proceed further
in this game,

947
00:42:41,655 --> 00:42:43,448
and I played as hard as I could
and tried to,

948
00:42:43,551 --> 00:42:45,164
you know, swing as many
relationships as I could.

949
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:46,647
But in the end,
you know, it'sSurvivor.

950
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,103
Sometimes you get caught.

951
00:42:48,206 --> 00:42:50,095
They were going for the big fish
and tonight they got him.
