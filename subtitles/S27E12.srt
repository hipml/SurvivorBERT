00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,252
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:02,544
"SURVIVOR".

3
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:03,169
>> LAURA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

4
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,130
AFTER LAURA M. WAS VOTED OUT, NO

5
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,423
COUPLES WERE LEFT AND THE GAME

6
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:12,887
WAS ON.

7
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,931
>> THE FOUR OF US.

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,391
>> Jeff: CALEB AND HAYDEN SAW

9
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,184
A CHANCE TO BLIND SIDE THEIR

10
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,060
BIGGEST THREAT.

11
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,104
>> TYSON'S GOT A HELL OF A

12
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,230
RESUME TO PREACH TO THE JURY

13
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,690
WHEN WE GET THERE.

14
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,274
>> Jeff: AFTER CIERA REVEALED

15
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,525
THEIR PLAN --

16
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,111
>> HE SAID "WE WANT TYSON GONE."

17
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,821
>> Jeff: TYSON WAS READY TO

18
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,655
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

19
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,115
>> I NEED CALEB AND HAYDEN OUT.

20
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,075
>> Jeff: NICING TRIBAL

21
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,119
COUNCIL, CALEB AND HAYDEN FEARED

22
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,912
THEIR PLAN WAS FALLING APART.

23
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,914
>> CIERA SAID YOU GUYS WANTED ME

24
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,081
GO.

25
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,624
>> BECAUSE WE THOUGHT YOU WERE

26
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,751
TRYING TO GET US.

27
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,419
>> Jeff: SO THEY THROUGH CIERA

28
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,044
UNDER THE BUS.

29
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,463
>> IT'S GOT TO BE CIERA.

30
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,589
>> ON THE SAME PAGE.

31
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,008
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

32
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,676
TYSON INSURED HIS SAFETY BY

33
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,802
PLAYING HIS IDOL.

34
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,220
ANY VOTES CAST FOR TYSON WILL

35
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,680
NOT COUNT.

36
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,264
IN THE END HE DIDN'T NEED IT

37
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,808
WHEN CALEB WAS SENT TO

38
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,893
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

39
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,772
CALEB, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

40
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,647
SIX ARE LEFT.

41
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:12,947
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

42
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:13,907
>> WELL, THAT WAS FUN.

43
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,283
>> WE'RE ALL HERE FOR DAY 30.

44
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,119
>> PIT OF SNAKES.

45
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,412
I'M SO EXCITED.

46
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,789
>> GOOD MOVE.

47
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,581
NOBODY SAW IT COMING.

48
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,499
>> SORRY, DUDE.

49
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,250
>> THAT'S A GREAT MOVE, MAN.

50
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,169
TRIBAL COUNCIL BLEW UP IN OUR

51
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,837
FACE BUT WE WERE EXPECTING TO

52
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,631
BLIND SIDE CIERA BUT GOSH!

53
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,758
IT WAS JUST -- I MEAN, GOOD MOVE

54
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:36,471
TO THEM.

55
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,015
KAT WOULD SAY TOUCHE AND I'M

56
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,809
THINKING THESE SONS OF -- GUNS.

57
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:41,142
(LAUGHS)

58
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,269
I HOPE EVERYBODY HERE LIKES

59
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,979
SECOND PLACE.

60
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:45,480
SECOND PLACE.

61
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,565
BECAUSE IF TYSON GOES TO THE END

62
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,608
HE'S WINNING BECAUSE HE IS

63
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,235
PLAYING A HELL OF A GAME.

64
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,695
PURE POETRY.

65
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,030
YOU ARE PLAYING THE BEST GAME.

66
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:54,572
NOBODY CAN TOUCH YOU SO FAR.

67
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,909
>> HEY, HEY, HEY!

68
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:58,993
OH, NO!

69
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,162
TYSON CAN'T DO NOTHING IF IT

70
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,664
WASN'T FOR ME!

71
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,624
TYSON WOULDN'T BE WHERE HE'S AT!

72
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,251
>> COME ON, LET THIS GUY TALK!

73
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,293
>> HE'S NOT PLAYING THIS GAME!

74
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,211
I'M PLAYING HIS GAME.

75
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,797
I GOT MY HAND ON HIS BACK.

76
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,841
>> HE'S PULLING THE TRIGGER.

77
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,009
>> HE'S ON MY LAP!

78
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:15,635
GERVASE, IF YOU'RE SITTING NEXT

79
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,929
TO HIM IN TEND HE'LL BEAT YOU

80
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,388
ALL DAY.

81
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,514
SAME WITH EVERYBODY HERE.

82
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,348
>> HAYDEN, WHY ARE YOU THROWING

83
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,433
ME UNDER THE BUS, DUDE?

84
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,393
>> I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

85
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,603
IT'S THE FLAT OUT TRUTH.

86
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,688
YOU DESERVE TO WIN THE GAME.

87
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,065
>> I DIDN'T LIKE HOW HAYDEN

88
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,233
THREW ME UNDER THE BUS WHEN HE

89
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,860
SAID "I'M VOTE TIGHE SON, IF

90
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,363
TAKES IT MAKES IT TO THE END I'M

91
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,573
GOING TO VOTE."

92
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,323
I WISH I WOULD HAVEN'T PLAYED

93
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,242
THE IDOL THEN I WOULD HAVE IT

94
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,869
FOR NEXT TIME.

95
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,954
ALTHOUGH I TRUST MY ALLIANCE

96
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,540
ENOUGH THAT THAT SHOULDN'T BE OF

97
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:45,874
MUCH CONCERN.

98
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,293
>> LET'S DECIDE WHO WE'RE VOTING

99
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,712
FOR RIGHT NOW NEXT TIME.

100
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,296
>> DIDN'T WE ALREADY SAY?

101
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,839
>> HAYDEN?

102
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,965
>> YEAH.

103
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,134
>> Jeff: OKAY, HAYDEN IT IS.

104
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,635
IF HE WINS THE CHALLENGE IT'S

105
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:57,844
KATIE.

106
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,262
WE CAN REMIND EACH OTHER ABOUT

107
00:02:59,345 --> 00:02:59,554
IT.

108
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,305
HE'S COMING BACK.

109
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:06,644
>> WE'RE GOOD.

110
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:20,867
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

111
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,247
COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S DUEL:

112
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,334
TINA, LAURA, AND CALEB VOTED OUT

113
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:35,131
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

114
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,215
CALEB, I DON'T THINK YOU EVEN

115
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,842
LOOKED UP AT THIS TRIBE OF

116
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,468
PEOPLE THAT VOTED YOU OUT AT THE

117
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,636
LAST TRIBAL.

118
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,929
>> YOU'D BE CORRECT.

119
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,263
>> Jeff: NOTHING TO SAY TO

120
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:42,472
THEM?

121
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,641
>> UM, THERE'S TWO FACES I'D

122
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,769
HAVE SOME GOOD WORDS FOR.

123
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,228
BUT JUST AFRAID TO LOOK THE

124
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:49,687
WRONG PLACE.

125
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,396
>> Jeff: WHO ARE THE TWO?

126
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,024
>> KATIE AND HAYDEN.

127
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,233
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY ELSE IS --

128
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,152
>> A MAN'S WORD IS A MAN'S WORD

129
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:56,653
AND IN THE SOUTH IT MEANS

130
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,321
SOMETHING AND IN THE GAME OF

131
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,616
"SURVIVOR" AND UTAH AND PHILLY

132
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,410
IT DOESN'T MEAN AS MUCH.

133
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,270
>> Jeff: TYSON AND GERVASE, I

134
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,106
THINK HE'S POINTING YOU TWO OUT.

135
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,982
UTAH AND PHILLY.

136
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,191
ANY THOUGHT'S ON THAT?

137
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,026
A MAN'S WORD IS A MAN'S WORD

138
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,444
EXCEPT IN PHILLY, GERVASE?

139
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,654
>> IT'S TRUE.

140
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,030
I'M OLD SCHOOL, YOUR WORD IS

141
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,614
YOUR BOND AND WE MADE A BOND

142
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,158
WITH CALEB AND HAYDEN AND FROM

143
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,326
WHAT I HEARD THEY TRIED TO DO US

144
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,954
DIRTY FIRST SO WE GOT SMART AND

145
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,247
DID IT TO THEM BEFORE THEY GOT

146
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,374
US AND I THINK THAT'S SORE LOSER

147
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,545
STATUS RIGHT THERE.

148
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,381
>> Jeff: LET'S GET TO TODAY'S

149
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:58,548
DUEL.

150
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,883
FOR TODAY'S DUEL WE'LL HAVE 150

151
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,634
WOODEN TILES.

152
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,011
USE THEM TO BUILD A HOUSE OF

153
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:03,219
CARDS.

154
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,929
THE FIRST TWO TO BUILD A HOUSE

155
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:09,392

00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,645
TWO WITH THE HIGHEST STACK OF

SEE ANOTHER SHOT TO GET BACK IN

159
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:15,565
THIS GAME.

160
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,276
THE LOSER IS OUT OF THIS GAME

161
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,280
FOR GOOD.

162
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,364
IN ADDITION, THE WINNER OF THIS

163
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,741

GO.

171
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,089
SOMETHING YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE

172
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:40,798
A KID.

173
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,799
HOUSE OF CARDS.

174
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,217
JUST NOT WITH A MILLION DOLLARS

175
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,053
ATTACHED TO IT.

176
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,513
THE FIRST TWO TO REACH THE TOP

177
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:53,061

SURVIVE OUT HERE.

181
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,570
THERE'S DEFINITELY A LEARNING

182
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,030
CURVE TO THIS.

183
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,699
SO IF YOU DROP, DON'T PANIC,

184
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,450
JUST START AGAIN.

185
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,621
YOU CAN'T LET IT BE DEMORALIZIN

186
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,581
DEMORALIZING.

187
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:27,804
JUST PICK UP AND CONTINUE ON.

00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,063
NEWS FOR SOUSE WE'RE GOING TO

IT AND DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH

379
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:58,360
IT.

380
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,820
>> READY?

381
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,573
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS BAD BOY

382
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:06,076
SAYS.

383
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,037
"NOT TOO FAR FROM YOUR WATER,

384
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,705
NOT TOO CLOSE TO THE GROUND

385
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,331
HIDES INCREDIBLE POWER BUT ONLY

386
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,584
IF IT'S FOUND."

387
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,128
"NOT TOO FAR FROM YOUR WATER.

388
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,922
NOT TOO CLOSE TO THE GROUND."

389
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,423
>> IN A TREE.

390
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,008
>> CIERA OPENS UP THE CLUE AND

391
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,843
READS IT ALOUD AND I WAS LIKE,

392
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,844
YES!

393
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,221
>> SHOULD WE START LOOKING?

394
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:25,763
>> YEAH.

395
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,014
>> I SAY WE SPY ON THEM.

396
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:27,890
>> YEAH, WE CAN DO THAT.

397
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,518
>> SO NOW EVERYBODY SCATTERS AND

398
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,311
LOOKING AND LOOKING AND ALL OF A

399
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,481
SUDDEN HAYDEN WALKS UP.

400
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,316
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING

401
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:37,483
FOR?

402
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,192
>> NOTHING.

403
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,028
>> I CRUISE TOWARDS THE WELL AND

404
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,364
TYSON, GERVASE, CIERA AND MONICA

405
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:43,948
ARE ALL DOWN THERE PEEKING

406
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,742
AROUND LOOKING IN TREES LIKE

407
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,452
HUNTING, SEARCHING AND IT'S

408
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:48,702
OBVIOUS.

409
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,161
THE IDOL IS DOWN THERE

410
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:49,411
SOMEWHERE.

411
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,455
>> YOU'RE GOING TO STICK BACK

412
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:51,914
HERE AND LOOK?

413
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,166
>> I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR A

414
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:54,416
MINUTE.

415
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,668
IT'S MY LAST HOPE.

416
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,545
I HAVE TO LOOK AND FIND THE

417
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,713
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

418
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:11,058
>> THIS IS STUPID.

419
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,729
>> I USED THE IDOL AT THE LAST

420
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,898
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND A NEW ONE

421
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,024
CAME BACK INTO PLAY AND I HAVE

422
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,985
TO FIND IT OTHERWISE I DON'T

423
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,738
KNOW WHO'S GOING TO HAVE IT.

424
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,156
SO SO THE SAFEST THING FOR ME TO

425
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,536
DO IS TO FIND THE IDOL.

426
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,078
I'M THREAT NUMBER ONE AND

427
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,955
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT AND I KNOW

428
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,122
THAT.

429
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,249
I'M JUST TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME

430
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,125
AND TRYING TO GET TO THE END AND

431
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,003
I TOLD MYSELF WHEN RACHEL LEFT

432
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,422
THAT IF I WAS GOING TO STAY I

433
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,133
HAD TO GET TO THE END.

434
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,969
SO THAT -- IT'S THE ONLY WAY

435
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,013
THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH IT FOR ME

436
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,140
TO STAY HERE AND NOT GO IN WHEN

437
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,936
I COULD HAVE SAVED HER.

438
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,065
SO I'VE JUST BEEN FIGHTING AND

439
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,487
CLAWING AND I'M SO CLOSE.

440
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,947
AND I STILL FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING

441
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:14,246
TO GET PULLED OUT FROM UNDER ME.

442
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,084
AND I HATE THAT FEELING BECAUSE

443
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,711
I'VE WORKED TOO HARD TO GET

444
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:26,675
HERE.

445
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:37,603
BOOM!

446
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,021
I DON'T HAVE POCKETS ON ANY OF

447
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,731
MY CLOTHES SO I'VE GOT TO PUT IT

448
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,316
RIGHT IN MY CRASH WHERE NOBODY

449
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,109
WILL SUSPECT A BULGE.

450
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,154
NOW THE TRICK IS, DO I SHARE IT

451
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,322
WITH EVERYBODY OR KEEP IT TO

452
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,323
MYSELF AGAIN?

453
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,494
I THINK I'LL KEEP IT TO MYSELF.

454
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,203
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

455
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,079
I CAN REST EASY.

456
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,082
I HAVE THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

457
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,668
IT'S UP TO ME TO JUST STAY

458
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,169
FOCUSED AND DON'T LET HAYDEN WIN

459
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:02,503
THE CHALLENGE.

460
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,380
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING,

461
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,381
HAYDEN CAN'T WIN.

462
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,757
THAT WAS THE DICIEST MOMENT OF

463
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,258
THE GAME FOR ME SO FAR WAS

464
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,096
HAVING THAT IDOL ON THE LOOSE SO

465
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,849
-- NOW I CAN PROBABLY TAKE A NAP

466
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,058
TODAY.

467
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,393
I WAS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

468
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,103
TAKE A NAP UNLESS I FOUND THAT

469
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,855
THING.

470
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,064
OKAY.

471
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,483
DID IT AGAIN.

472
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:29,905
NAP TIME.

473
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,704
>> WHERE'S YOUR HEAD AT, BRO?

474
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,288
WHERE'S YOUR HEAD AT?

475
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,623
>> IN THE GAME, AS ALWAYS.

476
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,083
>> LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU TOLD ME

477
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,626
YOU WERE OKAY WITH SECOND PLACE,

478
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,128
I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

479
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,546
>> I'M GLAD YOU DO.

480
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,589
>> I STRUCK A NERVE WITH GERVASE

481
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,173
SO I THINK GERVASE IS OPEN TO

482
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,134
WORKING WITH ME.

483
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:50,592
BLIND SIDING TYSON.

484
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,636
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

485
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,011
TO DO IT.

486
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,722
>> FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I DON'T

487
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,389
SEE A MOVE.

488
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,515
TELL ME A MOVE TO MAKE.

489
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,058
>> IF I HAVE KATIE-- WHICH I

490
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,184
DO-- AND I GET CIERA, YOU'RE ON?

491
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,854
>> YOU HAVE TO GET CIERA.

492
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:02,438
IT'S GOT TO BE -- YOU HAVE TO

493
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,859
LOOK AT MY FACE AND TELL ME

494
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,234
GERJ, IT'S 100%.

495
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,945
I THINK TYSON IS PLAYING THE

496
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,072
GAME WELL BUT I'M NOT PUTTING MY

497
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,408
TRUST AND FAITH IN HAYDEN AT

498
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:14,575
ALL.

499
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,159
I HAVE MY TRUST AND FAITH IN

500
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,953
TYSON AND IT'S GOT ME THIS FIRST

501
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,537
BUT I WANT THOSE OPTIONS OUT

502
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,372
THERE AND HAYDEN'S A GOOD OPTION

503
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:20,706
TO HAVE.

504
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,290
>> I WON'T DO ANYTHING TO BLOW

505
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,835
UP YOUR GAME.

506
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:48,317
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

507
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,612
GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

508
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,112

>> YES.

510
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,322
>> Jeff: FOR THE THIRD TIME,

511
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,867
I'LL TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE FROM

512
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,117

THANK YOU.

514
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,455
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

515
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,915
FOR GRABS.

516
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,166
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE

517
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,626
GOING TO RACE THROUGH A SERIES

518
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,293
OF OBSTACLES WHILE BALANCING A

519
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,754
BALL ON TOP OF A POLE.

520
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,923
AT THE END OF EACH OBSTACLE,

521
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,174
YOU'LL ADD ANOTHER SECTION OF

522
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,133
POLE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

523
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:13,342
BALANCE.

524
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,053
THE BALL DROPS, YOU GO BACK.

525
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,846
ONCE YOU REACH THE END YOU'LL

00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,681

00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,745
>> DO THEY HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT

749
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,622
IN FRONT OF CAMP?

750
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,666
>> GERVASE DECIDED TO CHOOSE

751
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,251
MONICA AND TYSON TO EAT ICE

752
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:26,876
CREAM WITH THEM AND THAT LEAVES

753
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,546
THE DOOR OPEN FOR ME TO TALK TO

754
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,964
CIERA AND PITCH HER THE IDEA,

755
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,425
HEY, CIERA, LET'S MAKE A MOVE

756
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,843
HERE.

757
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,929
>> SO SAY KATIE GOES HOME

758
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,264
TONIGHT OR I GO HOME TONIGHT.

759
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:39,681
>> OKAY.

760
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,391
>> Jeff: WHO DO YOU HONESTLY

761
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,143
THINK IS GOING TO GO HOME NEXT

762
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:43,351
WEEK?

763
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,853
DO YOU THINK KATIE GOES HOME

764
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:45,603
NEXT WEEK?

765
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,646
DO YOU THINK I GO HOME?

766
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,772
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE YOU.

767
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,232
>> I THINK IT'S YOU.

768
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,109
>> Jeff: WELL, I MEAN, I WOULD

769
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,360
LIKE -- I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE

770
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,280
ONE OF YOU TWO.

771
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,282
PART OF MY STRATEGY HAS BEEN

772
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,575
MAKING HAYDEN AND KATIE FEEL

773
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,784
LIKE THEY HAVE, LIKE, A GLIMMER

774
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,577
OF HOPE.

775
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,954
BUT I HAVE NO INTENTION OF DOING

776
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,789
ANYTHING WITH HAYDEN AND KATIE.

777
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,082
>> Jeff: YOU REALLY THINK

778
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:06,958
THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN?

779
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:07,876
>> YES.

780
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,295
AND THAT'S MY HONEST OPINION.

781
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,796
WHAT ARE YOU WANTING TO HAVE

782
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,047
HAPPEN?

783
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,758
>> I MEAN, I'M IN A TOUGH SPOT

784
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,551
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE ME MOST

785
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:16,801
LIKELY.

786
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,052
>> OKAY.

787
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:17,927
>> I GET THAT.

788
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:18,178
>> OKAY.

789
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,681
>> BUT IF WE HAD THE MAJORITY

790
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,350
WOULD YOU MAKE A BIG MOVE?

791
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,769
>> DEPENDS ON WHO YOUR MAJORITY

792
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:25,935
IS.

793
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,230
>> GERVASE IS ON BOARD IF YOU'RE

794
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:29,647
ON BOARD.

795
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,274
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU WANTING TO DO

796
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,359
AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW?

797
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:32,859
>> HERE'S THE THING.

798
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,861
TYSON MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE AN

799
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,070
IDOL.

800
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,114
YOU CAN EITHER MAKE A STINK AT

801
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:38,740
TRIBAL LIKE WE'RE GOING TO VOTE

802
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,867
OUT TYSON AND MAKE HIM FLUSH HIS

803
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,411
IDOL AND VOTE OUT MONICA OR WE

804
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:49,000
CAN TRY AND BE SLY.

805
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,710
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A RESUME TO WIN

806
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,795
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE SAID YOU

807
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,463
MADE A BIG MOVE AND THIS COULD

808
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,339
BE THAT FOR YOU.

809
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,383
>> AND ALL I'M TELLING YOU IS --

810
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,842
I MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

811
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,511
VOTES RIGHT NOW, FOR ME TO VOTE

812
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,845
WITH YOU GUYS TWAOUB 3-3 VOTE

813
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,391
AND I'M NOT DOING THAT.

814
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:04,933
>> Jeff: GERVASE AND CIERA

815
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,227
RIGHT NOW CAN MAKE A HUGE MOVE

816
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,561
AND GET OUT TYSON.

817
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,104
IF THEY MAKE THIS MOVE THEY

818
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,772
PROBABLY DESERVE TO WIN THIS

819
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:10,939
GAME.

820
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,274
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I WANT TO

821
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,070
TALK TO YOU BOTH.

822
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,905
YOU DON'T WANT SECOND PLACE.

823
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:19,906
YOU DON'T WANT SECOND PLACE.

824
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:24,911
IF WE ALL VOTE TOGETHER WE HAVE

825
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,120
FOUR.

826
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,330
THE THREE OF US, KATIE, TYSON

827
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,873
WILL NEVER SEE IT COMING.

828
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,793
TYSON GOES HOME.

829
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,295
NEXT WEEK KATIE GOES HOME.

830
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,089
IT'S A HUGE MOVE.

831
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,133
IF YOU WANT TO GET HIM OUT, IT'S

832
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:38,883
THIS TRIBAL RIGHT NOW.

833
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:39,759
HE'S NOT EXPECTING IT.

834
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,387
>> HE HAS THE NUMBERS.

835
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,847
>> HE HAS THE NUMBERS BUT HE

836
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,473
KNOWS THAT NOBODY -- HE KNOWS

837
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,100
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THEY'RE

838
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:47,976
GOING TO LOSE HIM-TO-HIM IN THE

839
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,436
END-- WHICH THEY ARE.

840
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,645
>> I THINK I HAVE A CHANCE TO

841
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,439
BEAT TYSON BECAUSE TYSON HAS

842
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,314
DONE THE SAME CRIMES.

843
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,442
>> HE HAS, BUT HE'S PLAYED THE

844
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:55,650
GAME.

845
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,318
>> TONIGHT IS SIMPLE: HAYDEN'S

846
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,903
GOT TO GO AND THEN THANK

847
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,364
GOODNESS IT CAN BE KATIE NEXT.

848
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,615
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'S STILL

849
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:02,824
AROUND.

850
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,119
>> I AGREE WITH GERV.

851
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,912
KATIE HAS JUST A BIG A SHOT OF

852
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,831
ME AT THE END AND YOU, DO, TOO.

853
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,333
>> YOU WANT TO WIN FIRST PLACE.

854
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,294
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE END

855
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:14,919
AND GET SECOND OR THIRD?

856
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,963
SECOND PLACE IS THE FIRST LOSER.

857
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,882
>> WHAT I WAS HOPING WAS CIERA

858
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,383
AND GERVASE WERE GOING TO ROLL

859
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,510
WITH ME TO BLIND SIDE TYSON AND

860
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,261
THEY'RE NOT DOING IT.

861
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,596
I DON'T LIKE TO LOSE.

862
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,848
I'M THE WORST -- THE WORST

863
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,850
LOSER.

864
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,187
GOT!

865
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,480
TYSON, I'M SITTING HERE TRYING

866
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,355
TO CONVINCE EVERYONE TO BLIND

867
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,148
SIDE YOU.

868
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,400
IT'S NOT -- IT HASN'T WORKED.

869
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,276
>> GOOD.

870
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,403
>> YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, BUT I'M

871
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,696
JUST TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME.

872
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:42,614
>> I KNOW.

873
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,239
I KNOW YOU ARE.

874
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:49,662
>> YUP.

875
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:55,376
>> THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

876
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,837
>> TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO INTO

877
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,005
TRIBAL GUNS BLAZING.

878
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,716
I'M GOING TO GO IT N AND BLOW IT

879
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:01,883
UP.

880
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:02,217
LET THINGS FLY.

881
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,884
GO DOWN SWINGING.

882
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,010
MAYBE IT WON'T BE ME.

883
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,470
WE'LL SEE.

884
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,304
WE WILL SEE.

885
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:14,145
THE CHAPTER IS NOT CLOSED YET.

886
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,573
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

887
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,826
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

888
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:34,249
ARAS, VYTAS, AND CALEB.

889
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,251
OKAY, SO AT THE LAST TRIBAL

890
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,044
COUNCIL THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR

891
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,879
DIVISION OF GERVASE, MONICA,

892
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,632
TYSON, AND CIERA AND THEN IT WAS

893
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,008
HAYDEN, KATIE AND CALEB WHO WAS

894
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,427
VOTED OUT.

895
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,054
SO, HAYDEN, IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME

896
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,514
IT'S STILL THAT DIVISION ONLY

897
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,598
NOW IT'S 4-2?

898
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,683
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

899
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,934
THE FOUR OF THEM ARE BEING

900
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,394
CONTROLLED BY TYSON.

901
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,272
THE TWO OF US ARE ON OUR OWN.

902
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,898
>> Jeff: BOY, THOSE ARE BIG

903
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,649
WORDS, CIERA.

904
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,817
HE JUST SAID YOU WERE BEING

905
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,693
CONTROLLED BY TYSON.

906
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,527
>> YEAH.

907
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,237
LET HIM THINK WHAT HE WANTS TO

908
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,612
THINK.

909
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,780
I'M COMFORTABLE IN MY POSITION

910
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:06,698
WITH MY ALLIANCE.

911
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,408
>> Jeff: ALTHOUGH YOU WEREN'T

912
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,784
CHOSEN TODAY BY GERVASE AS PART

913
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:10,618
OF THE REWARD.

914
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,495
>> I THINK HIS DECISION WAS

915
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,121
BASED ON THE FACT THAT I HAVE

916
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,373
BEEN ABLE TO BE A PART OF A LOT

917
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,082
OF THE FOOD REWARDS SO I DIDN'T

918
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,293
TAKE ANY OFFENSE TO IT.

919
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,086
>> IT'S OBVIOUS THE TWO PEOPLE

920
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,630
ARE CHOSE ARE ORIGINAL TKPWA

921
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,381
LANG MEMBERS.

922
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,091
I PUT MY BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS

923
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,635
IN THIS GAME.

924
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,177
>> Jeff: CIERA, THAT SPEECH

925
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,971
RIGHT THERE IS GREAT IF YOU'RE

926
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,015
TYSON AND MONICA.

927
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,683
NOT SO GOOD IF YOU'RE CIERA.

928
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,768
>> I AGREE 100%.

929
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,894
>> Jeff: HAYDEN, THIS IS THE

930
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,313
OPPORTUNITY YOU NEED BECAUSE YOU

931
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,939
AND KATIE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

932
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,483
IF YOU CAN SWAY CIERA TO GO 3-3,

933
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,443
NOW WE HAVE A NEW GAME.

934
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,902
>> JEFF, THAT'S IT.

935
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,614
AND, AGAIN, TYSON'S CONTROLLING

936
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,114
THESE PEOPLE.

937
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,782
CALEB AND I TOOK A BACKSEAT

938
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,784
WHILE TYSON POINTED FINGERS AND

939
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,578
SAID OKAY, IT'S ARAS.

940
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,037
OR IT'S VYTAS.

941
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,664
OR, HEY, IT'S LAURA.

942
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,666
>> WAS I THE ONE THAT VOTED YOUR

943
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:58,916
MOM SNOUT.

944
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,125
>> NO.

945
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,377
AND ACTUALLY HAYDEN AND CALEB

946
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,713
WERWERE THE ONES WHO SAID THEY

947
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,255
WANTED TO VOTE MY MOM OUT.

948
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,924
>> Jeff: KATIE, WHERE DO YOU

949
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:07,508
FIT IN IN ALL THIS?

950
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,051
>> WELL, DURING THIS WHOLE

951
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,052
POLITICAL WHAT HAVE YOU --

952
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,803
>> Jeff: HOLD ON.

953
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,304
HOLD ON.

954
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,848
WHEN YOU SAY DURING THAT WHOLE

955
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,475
POLITICAL WHATEVER, THAT IS

956
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,601
"SURVIVOR."

957
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,770
THIS IS WHERE THE GAME IS WON OR

958
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:18,978
LOST.

959
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:19,771
DO YOU GET THAT?

960
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,564
>> WELL, I'VE BEEN AT THE BOTTOM

961
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,232
SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BE A

962
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,985
PART OF THESE CONVERSATIONS.

963
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,820
>> Jeff: MONICA, WHY WOULD IT

964
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,615
MAKE SENSE FOR CIERA TO SAY THAT

965
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,408
TYSON MONICA GERVASE TRIO ARE

966
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,076
TIGHT, MAYBE I NEED GO WITH

967
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,703
HAYDEN AND KATIE AND HAVE A SHOT

968
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,204
TO THE END?

969
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,705
>> THAT'S A BAD MOVE.

970
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,874
BECAUSE FOUR IS BETTER THAN SIX.

971
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,876
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF

972
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,377
PROMISES HAVE BEEN MADE TO

973
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,003
PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE AT THIS

974
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,046
POINT START TO THINK ABOUT WHO

975
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,964
CAN I BEAT?

976
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,007
>> CAN I SAY SOMETHING, JEFF?

977
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,094
MONICA JUST SAID TO CIERA 4 IS

978
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,762
BETTER THAN 6 WHICH IMMEDIATELY

979
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,180
MEANS CIERA, YOU'RE NUMBER FOUR.

980
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,056
IF YOU CAME ON THIS SIDE, THERE

981
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,475
IS NO FOUR FIVE OR SIX.

982
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,935
THERE'S ONE, TWO AND THREE.

983
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,186
OR ONE, TWO, AND THREE.

984
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:00,645
HOWEVER YOU FRAME IT.

985
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,772
>> THAT'S INCORRECT.

986
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,190
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT'S

987
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:04,440
INCORRECT?

988
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,651
>> WHAT SHE HAS ON THAT SIDE IS

989
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,277
A BACK STABBER, A BACK STABBER,

990
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,153
A LIAR, A LIAR.

991
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,697
WHAT SHE HAS ON THIS SIDE IS

992
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,989
HONEST WORDS, PEOPLE WHO KEEP

993
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,157
THEIR WORD AND KEEP IT TOGETHER.

994
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,200
>>

995
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:14,450
(LAUGHTER)

996
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,159
>> WHY IS THE JURY LAUGHING?

997
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,245
>> BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO STAB US

998
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,913
IN THE BACK AND GOT PLAYED

999
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:19,163
FIRST!

1000
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,123
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE LAUGHING.

1001
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,165
NOBODY'S ENTERTAINING ANY IDEAS

1002
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,876
OF JUMPING SHIP IN THIS

1003
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,127
ALLIANCE.

1004
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,629
IT'S ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR.

1005
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,131
AND HAYDEN, GUESS THAT?

1006
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,341
YOU'RE GOING ON A JURY!

1007
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,217
BELIEVE THAT!

1008
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,552
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE JURY.

1009
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,803
>> I'M SURE.

1010
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,846
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1011
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,806
BUT GERVASE, ONCE AGAIN, CIERA

1012
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,266
WAS NUMBER FOUR WHEN YOU COUNTED

1013
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:38,808
IT OUT.

1014
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,561
>> JUST HOW I'M COUNTING.

1015
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,020
CIERA KNOWS ONE THING FOR

1016
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,439
CERTAIN: SHE'S NOT GOING HOME

1017
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,940
TONIGHT SO SHE CAN RUN WITH THAT

1018
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:46,649
TO THE BANK.

1019
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,275
BUT IF SHE WANTS TO GO HOME, THE

1020
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,485
TIME TO MAKE A MOVE IS NOW.

1021
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,236
>> Jeff: TYSON, THAT'S NOT

1022
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,863
NECESSARILY TRUE.

1023
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,239
YOU CAN DIVIDE THIS 3-3, SPLIT

1024
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,950
IT UP AND FORCE PEOPLE TO DRAW

1025
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:56,117
ROCKS.

1026
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,118
>> I DON'T THINK CIERA'S FOUR.

1027
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,828
>> YEAH, RIGHT.

1028
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,163
>> WELL, THEN THAT WOULD MEAN

1029
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,789
MONICA WOULD BE FOUR.

1030
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,165
>> PERHAPS.

1031
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,709
>> THERE'S NO PERHAPS ABOUT IT.

1032
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,294
IF CIERA'S NOT FOUR YOU ARE

1033
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:06,461
FOUR.

1034
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,045
>> YOU'RE ASSUMING ME AND

1035
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,505
GERVASE ARE ONE AND TWO?

1036
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,089
>> YES, I AM.

1037
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,216
>> CIERA, I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT

1038
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,844
NOW, I'VE NEVER BETRAYED YOU.

1039
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,428
THESE GUYS HAVE BOTH WRITTEN

1040
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,346
YOUR NAME DOWN AND I'VE

1041
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,431
PROTECTED YOU AND KEPT YOU WITH

1042
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,307
US AND I'M PLANNING ON STAYING

1043
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,600
WITH THAT.

1044
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,100
>> OKAY.

1045
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,852
>> Jeff: CIERA, BUCKNUMER BE

1046
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,187
FOUR ALL DAY LONG.

1047
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,481
YOU CAN COME WITH US, WE CAN

1048
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,190
DRAW ROCKS.

1049
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:27,482
>> CIERA --

1050
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,358
>> AND THAT'S A BIG MOVE.

1051
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,443
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1052
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,986
>> Jeff: CIERA, WHAT DID HE

1053
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,404
SAY WHEN HE CAME BACK TO CAMP

1054
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,906
AFTER CALEB WENT HOME?

1055
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,115
WHO'S GETTING HIS VOTE, TYSON?

1056
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,117
>> BUT THAT WAS TO RUFFLE YOUR

1057
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:38,951
FEATHERS GERVASE?

1058
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,287
>> DO YOU WANT SOMEBODY

1059
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,079
WISHY-WASHY OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1060
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,289
BEEN 100 WITH YOU?

1061
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,415
WE'VE BEEN 100.

1062
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,376
>> AIR IS IT WAS TO RILE

1063
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:47,668
FEATHERS.

1064
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,628
>> RUFFLE.

1065
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,422
RUFFLE FEATHERS.

1066
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,966
YOU SAID RUSTLE FEATHERS.

1067
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,301
>> RUSTLE, RUFFLE, WHATEVER.

1068
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,554
>> RUSTLE IS A FIRST NAME.

1069
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:02,683
>> R-U-S-TLE.

1070
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:08,564
RUSTLING LEAVES.

1071
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,857
>> Jeff: THAT'S THE CRAZIEST

1072
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:10,775
CONVERSATION I'VE EVER HEARD

1073
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,359
BEFORE A POTENTIALLY MILLION

1074
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,568
DOLLAR VOTE.

1075
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,446
>> CIERA, 1-4 OVER THERE AND YOU

1076
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,908
KNOW YOU'RE NUMBER FOUR.

1077
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,368
YOU MAKE A BIG MOVE AND IT WORKS

1078
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,452
OUT YOU'RE A MILLIONAIRE AT THE

1079
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:21,828
END OF THE GAME.

1080
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,580
>> AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT

1081
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,415
YOU CAN BE GOING HOME TONIGHT BY

1082
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,458
DRAWING A ROCK.

1083
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,167
>> Jeff: WOW.

1084
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,335
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY TRIBAL

1085
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:29,544
COUNCIL.

1086
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,796
LET'S SEE WHERE IT ALL COMES

1087
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:31,963
OUT.

1088
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,506
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1089
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,175
KATIE, YOU'RE UP.

1090
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,227
>> DON'T HATE THE PLAYERS,

1091
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,145
HOMEY, HATE THE GAME!

1092
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,772
THIS ISN'T PWROEZ, IT'S

1093
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,064
"SURVIVOR."

1094
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,440
WE DO THINGS DIFFERENT HERE.

1095
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,984
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET A LESSON IN

1096
00:35:53,067 --> 00:36:09,917
HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.

1097
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,546
>> NEVER TELL AN INSANE PERSON

1098
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:30,354
THEY'RE GOING HOME NEXT.

1099
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,773
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1100
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:40,281
VOTES.

1101
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,325
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1102
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,451
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW

1103
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:49,457
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1104
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,834
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ

1105
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:52,293
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1106
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,295
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1107
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,048
ASKED TO LI THE TRIBAL COUNCIL

1108
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:57,757
AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1109
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,925
I'LL READ THE FIRST.

1110
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,260
FIRST VOTE, HAYDEN.

1111
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:07,016
HAYDEN.

1112
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,435
MONICA.

1113
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:09,644
