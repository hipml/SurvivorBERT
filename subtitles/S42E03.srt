00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,117
OMAR: As hard as last night was,
I think we're in a good spot.

2
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,252
-LINDSAY: Me, too.
-Yeah.

3
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,453
And, like, I don't think

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,188
everyone's as close as we are.

5
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,289
<i>LINDSAY:</i>
<i>I'm happy that Tribal went</i>

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,524
<i>exactly how we planned it to go.</i>

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:28,428
<i>Me, Omar, Jonathan and Maryanne</i>

8
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,531
<i>all voted together, and</i>
<i>that made me feel really good.</i>

9
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,299
<i>Because ultimately, that was</i>

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,269
our main plan was for the four
of us to really stay tight.

11
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,839
This morning-- idol hunt.
Then after,

12
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,341
like, we can clear the camp ash.

13
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,544
<i>LINDSAY:</i>
<i>But last night,</i>

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,680
<i>Maryanne told us</i>
<i>she has an extra vote.</i>

15
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,949
(whispering):
Thank you, God.

16
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,191
<i>LINDSAY: I'm on the fence</i>
<i>about how I feel</i>

17
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,994
<i>about Maryanne</i>
<i>and the extra vote,</i>

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,829
<i>but if we stay at a tight four,</i>
<i>hopefully</i>

19
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,531
that's for all of our advantage.

20
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,502
It's not a bad spot

21
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,237
'cause all through there
are all those little roots.

22
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,573

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,642

28
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,752
Oh! Ugh!

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,387
A bug.

30
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,255
<i>So, like, I'm looking</i>
<i>at the nooks and crannies.</i>

31
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,758
Let me dig here. What about
that hole? Let me dig there.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,701
Just only there.

36
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,504
<i>My heart started pounding.</i>

37
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,005
I'm, like, freaking out.
I'm like, "Oh, my gosh.

38
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,541
Did I just do it?
Did I just find an idol?"

39
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,511
"Beware Advantage.
If you take it, it's yours,

40
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,547
and you must do what it says.
Otherwise, leave it."

41
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,850
<i>I saw "beware" and a risk,</i>
<i>and I'm like,</i>

42
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,117
"Oh, my goodness,
do I want to take this?"

43
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,353
<i>Because it could bite me</i>
<i>in the butt.</i>

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,089
God. I'm just scared.

45
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,058
<i>But I would rather</i>
<i>take the risk</i>

46
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,593
and go down in flames

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,728
then let my own hesitancy
be the thing

48
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,296
that gets me out of this game.

49
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,032
I'll do it. Oh, my God,
I'm so scared.

50
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,801
And the first thing I see

51
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,303
is what every single person
wants to see.

52
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,909
OMAR:
Wow.

53
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,811
But then I look at the paper
a little bit more.

54
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,050
Oh, my God. "Your phrase..."

55
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,290

Not only do I not have an idol,

00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,581
but I can't vote
at any Tribal Council

62

Where did they go?

68
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,905
HAI:
Uh...

69
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,777
Maybe I brought them
to the watering hole.

70

Good grief.

-Okay.

91
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,664
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I told Jenny and Daniel</i>
<i>about my idol,</i>

92

<i>but Daniel is a little neurotic.</i>

93
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,101
So first he said to me, "I need

94
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:28,835
to read the...
I need to read the note."

95
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,374
All right.

<i>MIKE: The thing is, I didn't</i>
<i>want to get Daniel pissed,</i>

<i>So against my better judgment,</i>

99
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,681

00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,617
-Here. Just...
-Read it, come back. Come back.

<i>The idols will not die</i>

108

<i>This changes everything,</i>

112
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,882

00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,953
Good job.

116
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,227
the idol and the
congratulation note is missing.

117
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,762
-You never gave me the idol.
-Yes, I did.

118
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,130
-You only gave me the paper.
-No, I didn't.

119
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,432
I gave you everything.

120
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,634
I seriously almost
stroked out right there.

121
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,636
"Get medical in here." That's
what I was thinking about.

122
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,004
"Get medical in here.
I'm stroking out."

123
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,676
DANIEL:

"Dude, dude, you lost the idol."

124
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,811

125
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,012
"Oh, my God, why?"

126
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,680
Why is this happening?

127
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,182
MIKE:
This is exactly why
I didn't want to do it.

128
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,616
<i>DANIEL:</i>
<i>I'm thinking, "No way.</i>

129

<i>You only gave me</i>

130
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,921
So I take him down to
the exact place where I read it.

131
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,690
-Uh, water bottle. Okay.
-Yeah.

132
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,258
It's a good sign. Here.

Where's the rest of it?

135
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,132
-That's all you need.
-No, I need the
"congratulations."

136
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,767
I need the other person

Get ready! Get ready!

342
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,586
(indistinct chatter)

343
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,858
(Probst mutters)

344
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,062
TORI:
Gas ourselves right here.
We can do this, Ika.

345
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,065
Who wants it?
Wait for me. Wait for me.

346
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,633
-HAI: All right, guys, come on.
-PROBST: All right.

347
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,302
We're going to resume
the challenge. Survivors ready.

348
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,372
Go!

349
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,874
-LYDIA:
-Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
-DANIEL: Come on, guys.

350
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,043
Now, with what energy
you have left,

351
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,978
you got to finish this sucker.

352
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,914
Lift it up a little bit. Lift.

353
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,916
PROBST:
You got to get the ladder up.
This one's a lot easier

354
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,317
'cause you've got a sure way
to the top.

355
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,552
Vati's up first.

356
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,520
-Jenny gonna go.
-Come on, Jenny.

357
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,191
Now Ika has it.
Swati going up.

358
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,660
Jenny has the sandbags,
she's down.

359
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,829
-Toss it down.
-PROBST: Swati has the sandbags.

360
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,163
She's coming down.

361
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,334
It's going to be Hai
tossing for Vati.

362
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,536
-Yes!
-Yeah!
-Hai lands the first one

363
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,438
for Vati.

364
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,240
-Yes!
-Rocksroy lands the first
for Ika.

365
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,276
We are tied 1-1.
Five bags total.

366
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,612
Rocksroy off and on.

367
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,814
-Chanelle lands the second
for Vati.
-(overlapping chatter)

368
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,986
-Yes!
-Rocksroy lands the second
for Ika. We're tied.

369
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,859
-Aah!
-Rocksroy lands the third.

370
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,895
-Ika now in the lead.
-DANIEL: Yes, Mike.

371
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,263
-Yes, Mike.
-Yes, Mike.

372
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,465
PROBST: Mike sticks
the third bag for Vati.

373
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,700
And we are tied 3-3.
Mike would love

374
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,301
to put Vati in the lead.

375
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,970
-And he does with that toss.
-Yes! Come on!

376
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,205
There's Rocksroy to tie it.

377
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,474
Rocksroy lands the fourth bag,
and we are tied again.

378
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,878
It's a showdown.
One bag left.

379
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,913
Mike can win it. No.
Rocksroy can win it right here.

380
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,948
-Oh!
-PROBST: Oh, no!

381
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,652
Chanelle's gonna come back in.
Can she win it with the jumper?

382
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,554
-No.
-No!

383
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,489
-Now it's Drea
who could win it for Ika.
-It's okay.

384
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,558
-You got it.
-ROCKSROY: You want me
to take it, I'll take it.

385
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,860
PROBST:
One tribe looking
to close it out.

386
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,898
-(screaming)
-And Drea does it for Ika,

387
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,935
sending Vati to Tribal Council
for the first time this season.

388
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,672
What a battle. Wow.

389
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,278
Taku, congratulations,
immunity is yours.

390
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,146
Thanks, Jeff.

391
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,415
Nobody going home
from your tribe.

392
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,819
Plus you win reward. Because
you didn't win the fishing gear,

393
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,321
you have the option to swap
that fruit for the fishing gear.

394
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,823
You're already
shaking your head.

395
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,090
-You want the fishing gear?
-LINDSAY: Yeah, Jeff.

396
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,692
We would like the fishing gear,
Jeff.

397
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,127
All right, fishing gear will
be waiting for you back at camp.

398
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,829
Thank you, Jeff.

399
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,531
And I got to say, Jonathan,
I've seen a lot of challenges.

400
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,333
I've rarely seen an individual
performance like that.

401
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,669
-Nice job.
-LINDSAY: Wow.

402
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,671
Ika, doesn't matter
you finished second.

403
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,439
I'll take it.

404
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,974
Only matters
you're not going to Tribal.

405
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,809
Your reward will be waiting
for you

406
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,512
back at camp-- small tool kit,
little bit of fruit.

407
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,514
All right,
before I send you guys off,

408
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,382
Taku, you're going
to pick one person

409
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,386
from Vati's tribe
to go on a journey.

410
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,222
You guys can talk about it.

411
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,794
It can't be somebody who's gone
on a journey. All right.

412
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,696
-Who you going to send?
-We're going to send Chanelle.

413
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,865
Chanelle's going
to go on the journey.

414
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,867
The question is,
who will go with Chanelle?

415
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,468
You're going
to pick one more person,

416
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,372
and it can be from your tribe
or from Ika.

417
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,673
(indistinct chatter)

418
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,208
What'd you decide?

419
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,043
-We're gonna send me.
-All right.

420
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,845
Omar and Chanelle, you guys
are gonna take a journey.

421
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,714
You will return back
to your camps

422
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,048
end of day.
Grab your stuff, head out.

423
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,650
-Thank you.
-Boat'll pick you up.

424
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,352
-Bye, Omar.
-Bye.

425
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,354
All right, Taku, Ika,
grab your stuff,

426
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,556
head back to camp.
No Tribal Council.

427
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,024
And your flint will be
waiting for you

428
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,726
-back at camp, as well.
-Thanks, Jeff.
-Thanks, Jeff.

429
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,427
All right, Vati,
Tribal Council tonight,

430
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,762
where somebody will be
voted out.

431
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,230
Before you go,
I'll take your flint.

432
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,269
You'll have a chance
to earn this back

433
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,870
at your next
immunity challenge.

434
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,672
Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight at Tribal.

435
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,908
Thank you.

436
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,211
<i>CHANELLE:</i>
<i>I'm excited to make a connection</i>
<i>across tribal lines.</i>

437
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,679
<i>But that's a very scary thing,</i>

438
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,781
to know that

439
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,251
<i>my tribe is back at camp,</i>
<i>scurrying around, scrambling,</i>

440
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,987
<i>trying to decide a vote,</i>
<i>and I'm not a part of it.</i>

441
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,878
<i>JENNY:</i>
<i>Today's challenge was brutal.</i>

442
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,647
<i>We ended up losing, and</i>

443
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,115
Chanelle being away right now

444
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,885
<i>definitely scares me a bit.</i>

445
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,488
<i>I know there is a decision</i>
<i>to make on the journey.</i>

446
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,424
Well, that sucked.

447
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,126
-HAI: Yeah.
-DANIEL: That was just brutal.

448
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,596
I'm proud of you for going
as long as we did.

449
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,497
<i>JENNY:</i>
<i>Mike doesn't have a vote, so,</i>

450
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,500
<i>I hope</i>
<i>that Chanelle played it safe.</i>

451
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,235
I can't stress that enough.

452
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,271
<i>I need her to vote with us.</i>

453
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,139
Anyone want to wash off with me?
I'm gonna go wash off.

454
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,741
-Yeah, I'm gonna wash off
with you.
-Okay.

455
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,177
Leave this stuff
and then get pretty for Trib...

456
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,946
Yeah, well...

457
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,915
HAI:
Yeah.

458
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,984
Whoever wants
to come is welcome.

459
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,919
JENNY:
So,

460
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,454
we love Lydia.

461
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,688
MIKE:
Yup.

462
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,323
You, me, Dan.

463
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,660
Oh, right, right.
Okay, that's...

464
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:06,331
So, me, Daniel, Chanelle
will vote Lydia. Yeah.

465
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,005
Yeah. Yeah.

466
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,439
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>We pretty much have</i>
<i>a game plan.</i>

467
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,141
<i>We're going to vote Lydia out,</i>

468
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,510
<i>but I have no vote, and</i>

469
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,345
<i>Daniel can get</i>
<i>a little squirrelly.</i>

470
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,348
<i>So obviously</i>
<i>I'm a little nervous that</i>

471
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,017
he would bail on us. He would
go to somebody he thinks

472
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,618
is strong 'cause he thinks
that's what it's all about.

473
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,189
We got to make it fast 'cause
the three of us can't be seen.

474
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,291
-Yeah.
-The three of us can't be seen
talking long.

475
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,028
-I know.
-DANIEL: Yeah.
-So, have you heard either

476
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,463
-of our names from them? Okay.
-DANIEL: Okay.

477
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,566
-We're just all
voting for Jenny?
-Yeah.

478
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,337
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>I feel very comfortable</i>

479
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,873
<i>with Lydia, Chanelle and Daniel,</i>

480
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:51,810
<i>but tonight will be the ultimate</i>
<i>test of trust for us.</i>

481
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,478
<i>This first Tribal</i>

482
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,048
will establish who's with who,
and I just got to make sure

483
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,517
I'm on the right side
of the numbers.

484
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,419
-Hai's still down there?
-That was rough,

485
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,320
-right, from the outside?
-Real quick.

486
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,257
They think I'm with them,
but I'm with you guys.

487
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,893
I wanted to keep up appearances.

488
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,095
Jenny. To be totally blunt.

489
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,663
I'll always be honest.
They're targeting Jenny.

490
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,899
But it doesn't matter
because we got me, you,

491
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,667
and Chanelle's vote are three.

492
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,136
That's a majority of the five,
so we'll put our votes on Lydia.

493
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,942
I hope so. I'm a bit nervous.

494
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,546
<i>I would prefer Lydia to go home</i>
<i>because Lydia is someone</i>

495
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,715
<i>who I'm less close with</i>
<i>than Jenny.</i>

496
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,749
<i>But Jenny and Mike</i>

497
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,617
only have one vote combined.

498
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,286
<i>Hai and Lydia have two votes.</i>

499
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,755
<i>So Chanelle very much is</i>

500
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,623
the deciding vote right now.

501
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,694
-Here we are.
-OMAR: Here we are. (laughs)

502
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,696
That was torture. (laughs)

503
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,698
-But she was...
-Jenny totally undersold this.

504
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,233

playing it safe--

671
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,208
do you evaluate,
"Do I believe her or not?"

672
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,843
You know, I'm a guy
that takes things at face value.

673
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,513
If somebody tells me something,
I want to... I believe it.

674
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,949
We've been together
for the starving, the building,

675
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,750
the running through challenges.

676
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,953
We've made a bond
amongst all of us,

677
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,889
and I don't think she would come
back and give us a snow job.

678
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,924
PROBST:
Hai, do you think

679
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,560
that you can vote somebody out

680
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,596
and still go back to camp
and have the kumbaya

681
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,931
that you guys are talking about?

682
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,467
While tonight
will draw tribal lines,

683
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,037
I believe the Vati six
is strong enough to go back,

684
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,206
regroup and collect ourselves
because

685
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,275
these guys are my family,
and I trust them.

686
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,077
PROBST:
Daniel, do you agree,

687
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,579
tonight will draw lines
no matter what?

688
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,214
DANIEL:
Um, 100% it's gonna draw lines.

689
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,882
That's true, but, Jeff,

690
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,585
let me tell you why
I will lose season 42.

691
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,587
The reason is because

692
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,056
I'm constantly
in a state of paranoia.

693
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:35,460
I'm running numbers, going nuts.
It's driving me crazy.

694
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,995
And you can't win that way

695
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,463
because you've got
to trust your gut.

696
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,898
But if you're always paranoid,
you can't trust your gut

697
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,233
because you can't differentiate

698
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,402
between the paranoia
and your gut.

699
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,571
So for me, I need some people
that are just going to tell me

700
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,006
to chill every once in a while.

701
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,774
Who calms you down?

702
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,809
(sighs)
Mike calms me down.

703
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,312
Chanelle calms me down.

704
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,413
My mother calms me down.

705
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,482
My girlfriend.

706
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,350
You calm me down, Jeff. Not
really. You don't calm me down.

707
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,121
-This is scary
being here right now.
-(laughter)

708
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:06,157
So, Lydia, will it be difficult
for you to make a vote,

709
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,860
or is there a part of you that
"this is why I came to play"?

710
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,762
LYDIA:
I mean, I'm...

711
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,631
Personally, I'm terrified.
I am excited because, you know,

712
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,100
as a fan you're like,
"This is really neat."

713
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,335
Like, you could just...
This is gnarly.

714
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,803
Like, this is wild.

715
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,539
You know,
so there is that excitement.

716
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,341
But then
there's that horrible reality,

717
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,376
like what if it is me?

718
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,679
PROBST:
Jenny, Lydia just said it.

719
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:31,349
You can say it's hard
and you can say it's exciting.

720
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,718
But the thing that's lingering
in everybody's head is,

721
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,120
"Unless it's me."

722
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,524
My heart is pounding
through my chest right now

723
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,725
because it could be me.

724
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,462
I did go on that summit, and

725
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,198
I told a story when I came back
about what occurred there,

726
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,200
and I told the truth.

727
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,703
But there is this little doubt
in my mind

728
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,906

people might not believe me.

the four of you-- Hai, Daniel,

763

Jenny and Lydia become safe,

768
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,429
and the four of you
will draw rocks,

769

840
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,633
-I said from day one
that I want to work with you.
-Yeah.

841
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,168
I've never lied to you.

842
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,636
So why don't I give
my rationale here?

843
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,571
I wanted to work with Chanelle,
so we talked.

844
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,806
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

845
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,340
-Daniel, Daniel, no, no.
-No. Yes.

846
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,508
-That's not okay.
That's not okay.
-That's 100% true.

847
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,477
-That is 100% true.
-Don't tell me that you,

848
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,245
a superfan of<i> Survivor,</i>
came on here and said,

849
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,780
"Oh, I'm just going
to let Chanelle choose."

850
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,148
-That's not true at all.
-No.

851
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,850
-That is 100% true.
-That is not true at all.

852
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,020
Hai, you have to believe me
when I tell you...

853
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,955
-Hai, that's not true.
-...the only reason
I voted Lydia...

854
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,457
-Okay.
-...was because Chanelle told me

855
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,092
-that we were in...
-Hai, please believe this...

856
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,359
-...a four-person alliance here.
-Okay, I understand,

857
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,462
but I'm asking Chanelle. Please

858
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,664

like to vote out.
-Yes.

859
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,798
-I want... I want to know...
-CHANELLE: Dan-Daniel, I...

860

Wait. Before she answers
that question,

861
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,502
I need to ask Hai a question.
I'm sorry.

862
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,671
Is there any way you're going
to change your vote?

863
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,540
-Is...? Do you want
to draw rocks?
-JENNY: Hai, I-I want

864
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:37,842
-to talk with you.
-I did, too.

865
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:38,709
-I did, too.
-We need you both to... Hai.

866
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,978
We can do this, Hai.

867
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,380
CHANELLE:
But I want to let you know

868
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,649

-MIKE: We have
to come to a decision.

869

And I've been with you
since day one.

870

I've been wanting to work
with you since day one.

871
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,957
Hai, if you vote me out,
you're fracturing the tribe.

872
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,826
-We all had agreed
to vote Lydia.
-MIKE: Yeah, I...

873

I want to stay strong
as a tribe.

874
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,163

-I understand

I'm willing to draw rocks.

882
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,049

-Yes. I am your ally 100%.

883
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,985
-What promise...?
-Because I just got
backstabbed by the person

884

-Wow.

-No.
