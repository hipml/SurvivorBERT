What is your most

00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,257
<i>The members of Moto Maji</i>

4

<i>with the help of their loved</i>

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,595
- I threw up in the middle of
my human sexuality class.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,056
- When he threw up all over
another student.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,934
<i>- Lex won and picked</i>
<i>Tom to join him on a trip</i>

8
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,937
<i>to the Masai Mara to watch</i>
<i>the wildebeest migration.</i>

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,647
- They're crazier than hell,
they're ugly.

10
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:27,444
They're as ugly as a girl
I used to date back home.

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,779
- The safari was amazing.

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,281
Oh, look at that,
look, look, look-- a hunt!

13
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,282
I'm seeing stuff that I had
never seen,

14
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,242

<i>...and Lex was</i>

21
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,128
- Even after we went
on our safari,

22
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,504
I'm still irritated at Lex.

23
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,839
I don't think he
did me right.

<i>- At Tribal Council, Lex</i>

25

26
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,096
that walk of shame.

37
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:47,083
- We have five people
left here in Africa,

38
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,294
in Kenya, in Moto Maji camp.

39
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,254
Five people,
that's it.

40
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,422
Started with 16.

41
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,424
Now we're down to five,
amazing.

42
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,426
- Morning, T-Bird.
- Morning.

43
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,927
- How are you?
- Morning, T-Bird.

44
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,429
- Morning, everybody.
- How you doing?

45
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,597
- Doing good,
how are ya'll doing?

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,764
- Good, good, good.

47
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,975
- Every little thing we
do now is a huge effort.

48
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,436
We're beginning to talk
more in terms now

49
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,563
of when we're going home,
we are counting the days.

50
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,565
I think it's starting to
take a toll on our bodies.

51
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,108
- Every night my arms
go to sleep.

52
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,109
- My whole damn arm.

53
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,486
- It's not just my arm,
my ass goes to sleep.

54
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,947
My shoulder goes to sleep.

55
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,908
- Just my arm, my hand...

56
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,701
- I never thought it was
going to be this hard,

57
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,787
physically, mentally,
psychologically, emotionally.

58
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,456
And now that we're so close
to the end, I'm exhausted.

59
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:32,295
But up until just the last few
days, I've really tried hard

60
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,756
not to think about
my kids and my wife.

61
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,799
Two buckets, two gourds.

62
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,469
But I can't allow myself
to give into any of that

63
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,055
until I'm finished.

64
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,435
You can't afford,
out here, to be a sissy.

65
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,898
It has been pretty funny that
we take our drinking water,

66
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,483
basically out of an
elephant's toilet.

67
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,152
We got an elephant
disrespecting our spring.

68
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,487
- Oh, how disgusting is that?

69
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,822
- Right where
we do our laundry.

70
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,657
I mean, he could have
picked anywhere.

71
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,450
He might as well
have just put his butt

72
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,493
right over the spring.

73
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,787
- That's a monster
of a turd.

74
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,330
- That's a jackpot.

75
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,832
- Yeah, and it's
already covered in gnats.

76
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:14,420
- I find in the water hole
relaxation.

77
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,839
We love this spot,
we come here all the time.

78
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,967
And today, we were visited
by someone

79
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,343
just prior to
our getting here

80
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:25,348
that left us a big
giant gift.

81
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,143
It's very fresh, very smelly,

82
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,064
very large, and we're
getting used to it.

83
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,524
- You got to drink and you got
to pull your water

84
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,485
and you got to wash,
but God, holy mackerel,

85
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,486
that elephant, he couldn't
have picked

86
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,698
a better spot to
relieve himself in.

87
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,366
It looked like he hadn't
done his business

88
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,367
in a couple weeks.

89
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,246
(elephant rumbling)

90
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,748
- I want to be in harmony
with all the animals

91
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,835
and all the people,
but it's hard to do,

92
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,670
especially here down
at the end.

93
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,338
- I wonder if you
drowned yourself,

94
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:57,880
now you're so quiet?

95
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,549
- I'm in deep thought.

96
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,552
- Kim Johnson washes in
elephant [...] every day.

97
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:09,058
And I've told her,
I said, "Kim, down there

98
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,894
"at the bottom of that creek,
I said, you are washing

99
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,521
"where the elephants
has pooped in the water.

100
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,441
"You're washing in that--
washing your clothes,

101
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,901
washing your face,
washing your hind end."

102
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,528
She has yet to
understand that,

103
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,655
and I've quit telling her.

104
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:27,410
And I let her wash
in it every day.

105
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,579
I keep thinking,
I try to smell it,

106
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,456
see if she smells like an
elephant, but really she don't.

107
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,416
But, she's washed
in it every day.

108
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,586
And I... I quit telling her.

109
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,672
- Okay.

110
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,759
One foot in front
of the other.

111
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,636
- That's right.

112
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,143
- This stage of the game,
boredom is something

113
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,604
that has definitely
become a reality.

114
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,606
Plus, I mean, frankly,
we've been out here 35 days.

115
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,816
We're running out of things to
talk about and things to do.

116
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,651
- (whistling)

117
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,279
- I've probably gotten to know
the four other people

118
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,114
that are left here
better than some people

119
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,242
that I've known for five,
ten years.

120
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,328
Tom, you got to put
those things far away.

121
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,288
- Yeah, you got to put them,
maybe, in the fire.

122
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,456
- (laughing)

123
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,792
- No, I'm serious, I think
it would be a good for us

124
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,293
if we burned those.

125
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,296
Tom's feet stink, perhaps,
the worst I've ever smelled

126
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,507
of anyone's feet,
on the planet Earth.

127
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,635
And... they smell so bad.

128
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,637
He's got some funk down there
that I've never smelled before.

129
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,139
- I don't like being
so close to you.

130
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,349
- Everybody complains.

131
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,142
Ethan is terrible,
he hates 'em.

132
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,104
He raises hell,
he wants me to move my shoes.

133
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,688
He told me, throw
my shoes away.

134
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,359
- Good gust of wind, that [...]
smell is going in my nose.

135
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,320
I can't stand it.

136
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,988
Just throw them away.

137
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,074
- I can't throw
my boots away.

138
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,200
- Don't put
them near my head.

139
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:49,992
Put them over near
the water.

140
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,120
They're bad,
he's got a problem.

141
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:52,620
I think he's got a problem.

142
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,582
(Tom whistling)

143
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,012
(Tom yawning)

144
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,015
(chicken clucking)

145
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,642
- Some water there?

146
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,852
- Yeah.

147
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,687
- We're sitting there,
enjoying our popcorn,

148
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,188
and Tom is like...

149
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,231
- Hey, hey, hey!

150
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,525
Hell, Big Red's out.

151
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,860
- Oh my God.
- Nobody move, I'll get him.

152
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,194
I'll get him.
I'll get him.

153
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:25,945
We're buddies.

154
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,739
- Buddies, hell,
get the hatchet.

155
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,992
A lot of people
saw a chicken out.

156
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,369
I saw my dinner out,
walking around,

157
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,704
and it might get
out of that bunker.

158
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,705
- Come here, little bugger.

159
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,875
- Come here, Big Red.

160
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,335
(clucking frantically)

161
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,880
- Headed in your direction.

162
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,423
- They were panicking
a little bit,

163
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,674
wanting to run the chicken.

164
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,717
Worst thing you could do
is run that chicken.

165
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,261
So I just laid there.

166
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,054
I didn't want to
panic that chicken.

167
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,723
Just bring her to me,
bring her on to me.

168
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,893
Throw some corn
right in front of me.

169
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,061
- That chicken kind of
walked by Tom.

170
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,730
He's laying down,
half asleep, just...

171
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,900
(clucking frantically)

172
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,069
Got both legs, the chicken,
he's like, got it.

173
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,863
It was pretty,
pretty impressive.

174
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,614
- Tom, no, we're not
killing her today.

175
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,698
Tommy, stop!
- (Tom growling)

176
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,742
- Stop it,
Tom, Tom!

177
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,743
(Tom spits)

178
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,785
- Give me a bite of that.

179
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,288
- Damn chicken.
- Give me a bite.

180
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,416
We just pretended to wrestle
it and have a little fun,

181
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,084
a little
excitement in the day.

182
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,587
You know, maybe we'll let it out
some more and try to catch it.

183
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,922
Let's have some fun.

184
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,840
- She'll be a chicken
potpie?

185
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,108
- We went to tree mail,
expecting that

186
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,818
it was going to
be challenge time.

187
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,153
- Something big.

188
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,279
- Oh, I like big.

189
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,781
- This was a completely
different kind of tree mail,

190
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,658
because we opened up
the mailbox

191
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,909
and it was an instant reward.

192
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,621
Well, there's something for
each and every one of us here.

193
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:58,996
- Yay!

194
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,457
- Mail call.

195
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,128
Teresa, Kim, and Lex.

196
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,630
- From Ali!

197
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,132
(cheering)

198
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,133
- A letter?

199
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,635
A letter?

200
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,095
- Oh!

201
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,972
Oh, oh!

202
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,473
Oh, my God.

203
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,684
- I've got a whole
mess of letters.

204
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,812
I had letters from my
wife, from my two sons,

205
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,189
from my mother, my father.

206
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,692
It doesn't get any
better than that.

207
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,822
It gave me what I need to get
through the next few days.

208
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,200
It fed my body and my soul.

209
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,035
(sniffles)

210
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,831
- It seems like the first one
I probably grabbed

211
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,875
was from my dad,
because his health

212
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,168
is not very good.

213
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,753
Before I left,
I remember telling him,

214
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,505
"You better be here
when I get back."

215
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,174
So I think his letter
probably touched me the most

216
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,135
because I worry the
most about him.

217
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,517
- "Don't forget
the pressure's on,

218
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,603
"so if you feel like giving up
and being a puss,

219
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,355
"just remember that
you have to be tough

220
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,651
and uphold my reputation now
that I'm the big dog."

221
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,904
Is that some way
to talk to your dad?

222
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,246
- It's really good
to hear from them,

223
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,874
'cause they put their
ink on this paper.

224
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,753
You know, they touched this
paper, and we can touch them.

225
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,340
So it's... it's really nice.

226
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,841
(sniffles)

227
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,760
- It was just the best.

228
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,511
Just to hear from home
was unbelievable.

229
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,804
It was great.

230
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,268
My husband wrote me a poem,
and he's not a poem writer.

231
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,227
Kippy's my nickname.

232
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,937
And actually, even before
I came on this,

233
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,733
he's always called
me "Survivor Kippy."

234
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,571
"There once was a girl
named Kippy Grant,

235
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,573
"who never said
the words 'I can't.'

236
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,742
"Friends all say she's
not like most dames,

237
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,285
"and now she's gone
in Kenya, you know.

238
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,621
"It's hard to cover for
Kippy's no-show.

239
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,830
"For a mom and a wife
who really loves living...

240
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,542
(sniffles)

241
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,794
We're lucky indeed
you're always so giving."

242
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,172
- That's a great poem.

243
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,302
- This experience
would be nothing

244
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,056
if I didn't have somebody to
go back and share it with.

245
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,059
It definitely brought a calm
and a reality to me

246
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,602
that, you know,
the game's almost over,

247
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,313
and that's where I'm
going back to.

248
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,831
- Mailman's early today.

249
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,296
You guys, we have tree mail.

250
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,798
- Okay.

251
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,966
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

252
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,970
- "Reward Haiku:
A surprise visit.

253
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,807
For one whose brain is sharpest
but who will claim it?"

254
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,311
- I cannot believe that as
far out in the middle of...

255
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,232
nowhere we are, that there is
actually the possibility

256
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,650
of a visit,
I just--

257
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,320
- A surprise visit may be
for us to go see something.

258
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,156
- It doesn't say a
surprise visitor.

259
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,615
- Interesting.

260
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,784
- "Brain is sharpest."
Hmm...

261
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,703
- Maybe we have to write
a Haiku or something.

262
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,288
- Tell me what a
haiku is again?

263
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,706
- It's a Japanese poem.

264
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,165
- That's a haiku.

265
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,958
- Oh, my God!

266
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,169
I can't even say "haiku."

267
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,023
- All right, today's reward
challenge is not physical.

268
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,983
Doesn't require endurance,
it's strictly mental.

269
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,235
It's a word scramble.

270
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,029
You'll have a list
of 12 Swahili words.

271
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,532
Each time you find a word,
circle it.

272
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,658
Mark it off your list.

273
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,537
Each word will intersect with
at least one other word,

274
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,831
and that is the key
to solving this puzzle.

275
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,083
Once you found all 12 words,
take the intersecting letters,

276
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,421
unscramble them, and make
one final English word.

277
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,589
To help you out,
there's a clue

278
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,008
tacked to the bottom of your
board for the final word.

279
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,844
First person to get
the final word correct...

280
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,720
wins a reward.

281
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,056
There's two parts to
your reward today.

282
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,974
The answer to your puzzle
will explain the first part.

283
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,894
Second part,
I'll tell you about later.

284
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,020
It's going to be
a great reward.

285
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,231
Shall we get it on?
- Yes.

286
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,900
- Let's go,
pick a board.

287
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,569
Here we go, guys,
survivors ready?

288
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,030
Go!

289
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,963
Lex has two.

290
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,263
Look carefully.

291
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,055
They're
all there.

292
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,983
Lex now has four.

293
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,405
K.J. got one.

294
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,241
You're on the board.

295
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,993
- Thank God.

296
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,078
- Tom got his
first one.

297
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,376
Lex in the early lead
with five.

298
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,966
Kim Johnson has two.

299
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,260
Ethan with three.

300
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,429
Big Tom has two.

301
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:55,144
Lex with six,
still in the lead.

302
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:59,982
T-Bird with two.

303
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,108
Ethan with three.

304
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,241
Teresa still with three.

305
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,666
Lex with nine.

306
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,084
Only three more
to go.

307
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,345
Lex has 12,
he's working on his clue.

308
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,597
Ethan's at six.

309
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,733
K.J. up to four.

310
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,836
Lex is spelling out
his final word.

311
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,463
Winner, Lex.

312
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,467
- Yes!

313
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,427
- Congratulations, my friend.
- Thank you.

314
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,221
- It's going to
be a great day.

315
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,098
- Yeah!

316
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,481
- Hey, guys, we're going
to take a little walk.

317
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,612
- Oh, I see a wheel.

318
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,240
- Some chrome.
- I see some chrome.

319
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,201
Get out of town.

320
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,412
- Chevy Avalanche,
it's all yours.

321
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,581
- Oh, yeah!

322
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,084
- When I walked around
that bush and saw

323
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,294
that big blue Chevy truck
and knew it wasn't mine,

324
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:50,592
I was so, like, jealous.

325
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,095
So I was annoyed and
a little pissed off.

326
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,597
Trying to be happy for Lex,
but deep down inside,

327
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,057
I wasn't
that happy for him.

328
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,100
It's tough,
it's annoying.

329
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,562
You know, I just-- I don't
want him to win anymore.

330
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,942
- Now let's get to
the special visit

331
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,944
part of this reward.

332
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,945
You're going to
have a great honor.

333
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,321
You are going to be an
ambassador of good will,

334
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,533
because, as you guys
certainly know,

335
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,535
AIDS in Africa, huge problem.

336
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,455
So we've loaded up some
really special cargo.

337
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,415
Hop off and I'll
show you what it is.

338
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,169
- Oh, nice!

339
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,005
- This, plus another
truckload,

340
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,673
is a year's worth
of medical supplies.

341
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,800
We're taking it to
Wamba Hospital.

342
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,845
It's the coolest place,
this guy started it in 1961.

343
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,514
40 years, only on
charitable donations.

344
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,643
- When they opened up the back
of the truck, I saw "H.I.V."

345
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,646
It was very emotional
for me because my brother

346
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,316
passed away of AIDS, so right
away when I saw that

347
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,985
it just brought back all
the emotions of everything.

348
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,197
Unfortunately, 11 years ago,
there was so little

349
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,656
known about AIDS.

350
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,283
It made me
very happy.

351
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,744
- That's fantastic.

352
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,332
- Let's get out of here,
you're driving.

353
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,718
- When I won the truck,
Jeff explained to me,

354
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,554
kind of, what the visit
part of the reward was,

355
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,640
and it was actually
visiting a hospital

356
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:23,811
in a village here in
Kenya called Wamba.

357
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,855
And our visit was
going to be to deliver

358
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,690
a year's worth of supplies,

359
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,777
especially for all of
their AIDS testing.

360
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,281
I'm out here spending all
this time playing this game

361
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,409
<i>Survivor,</i> focusing
on nothing but,

362
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,662
without realizing now
that I haven't even

363
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,581
really thought about,
ironically, what the word

364
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,209
"survivor" and what the
word "survive" means.

365
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,836
And this is the
perfect situation

366
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,963
to just remind me of that.

367
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,010
It's a little hospital,
in this little village,

368
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,387
in the middle of Kenya.

369
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,014
People come from all over.

370
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,394
Jambo!

371
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,271
Wow,
this is cool.

372
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,147
What a cool place.

373
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,358
- There's the doctor,
straight ahead.

374
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,242
Dr. Prandoni,
good to see you.

375
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,077
- Welcome.
- Welcome, thank you.

376
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,036
This is Lex.

377
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,706
He has a very special
delivery for you.

378
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,874
- Jambo.

379
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,917
This old Italian gentleman,
this doctor,

380
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,460
has dedicated
his entire lifetime

381
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,797
to helping people
here in Africa.

382
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,258
This guy does it simply out of
the goodness of his own heart

383
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,386
and has single-handedly
mobilized and inspired

384
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,764
enough people to create a
completely self-sufficient

385
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,393
hospital in the
middle of nowhere.

386
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,562
- We have test kits,
nevirapine,

387
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,771
which I know you need.

388
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,607
- Thank you.
- You are so welcome.

389
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,610
It's our honor, our pleasure.
- You're amazing.

390
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,987
- Here comes the
rest of it now.

391
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,658
Come on back here.

392
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,160
- We are delivering all
these medical supplies

393
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,411
that they're in
desperate need of.

394
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,288
I mean, they're running on fumes
at that hospital as it is,

395
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,124
and we are also
going to provide them

396
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:12,336
with a new drug that allows
pregnant women

397
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,965
who have H.I.V. to have
children, and the children

398
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,760
have a better-than-50% chance
of being born without H.I.V.

399
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,095
Whereas, if they didn't
get this medication,

400
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,555
they would probably
be born H.I.V.-positive.

401
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,814
We got a tour of
the pediatric ward,

402
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,860
which was both heart-breaking
and just inspirational.

403
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,785
You've got these little kids,
almost all of them orphans.

404
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,120
I got to actually
pass out toys,

405
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,500
which, you know,
is always a good time.

406
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,377
I got to play with
these kids.

407
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,462
They made me miss
the hell out of my kids.

408
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,339
Bye-bye.

409
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:03,011
You walk out of there,
after spending a day

410
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,222
checking out the hospital,
talking to the doctors,

411
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,348
seeing all of this
stuff face-to-face,

412
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,809
I walked away a
changed person.

413
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,686
Doctor, it was a great
pleasure, thank you again.

414
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,521
- The pleasure was mine.

415
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,652
See you.

416
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,238
- The gift I take away from here
is he's planted a small seed

417
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,448
in me and I'm going to
take that home with me.

418
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:38,171
- Today there's a
little bit of animosity

419
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,382
towards Lex on winning
that truck.

420
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,886
I had a lot of people
asking me about my alliance

421
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,390
and trying to change things.

422
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,516
The second thing,
the three of us had alliance

423
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,394
and then, they never told me
nobody else was in it.

424
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,896
- Right.
- Anybody that was good--

425
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,357
was good to me, I've tried
to take care of 'em.

426
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,860
And I've tried to use
my personal judgment

427
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,488
on how far I thought
they ought to go.

428
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,615
- (whispering) We don't
want to get this far

429
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,661
and have it be
Lex and Tommy.

430
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,539
I mean, you've come too far
to have that happen to you.

431
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,708
I'm absolutely
trying to work a deal.

432
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,918
You guys get rid of me, okay,
there's the three of you.

433
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,087
With that in mind,
I know all these guys

434
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,964
don't really want to come down
to the threesome.

435
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,424
They're all
skeptical of each other.

436
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:27,471
My dilemma then, at this point,
with my immunity at stake,

437
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,432
is to figure out
which of the guys

438
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,142
is feeling the most
vulnerable.

439
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,895
Which one is the best
one to try to approach

440
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,439
with some type of scenario.

441
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,941
(whispering) If you don't
eliminate one of those two

442
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,278
tomorrow, you have to eliminate
one of those two the next time.

443
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,489
- Yeah, I know that.
- And you have to decide.

444
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,241
- Today, Kim approached me
and she's like,

445
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,785
"You got to get Lex off."

446
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:50,911
She's like,
"If you don't get Lex off,

447
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,706
you're shooting yourself
in the foot."

448
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,416
- Hello.

449
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,626
- We thought maybe
you had gone out

450
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,294
for steak dinner in addition.

451
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,296
- No, no.
- No such luck?

452
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,631
- I was gone most of the day.

453
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,259
When I got back, the vibe
was thick at camp.

454
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,636
- How was it?
- So pull up a chair.

455
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,304
- It was heavy.

456
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,306
It was really heavy.

457
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,600
And so we...

458
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,812
Everyone else in the tribe
was bummed about the fact

459
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,313
that they lost
and didn't win.

460
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:22,192
They've got patients from
Ethiopia, Somalia, Mogadishu.

461
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,193
Everyone was nervous,

462
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,862
and no one really wanted
to talk about anything.

463
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,783
So, anyway, we got there and
there's this old doctor there.

464
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,452
There was some strange
stuff going down.

465
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,913
The mojo was just funky.

466
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,711
- He's healthy, he's been
eating normally.

467
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,423
He's been out of the camp
five more days than I have.

468
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,008
You know, he's riding
on confidence.

469
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,677
It's tough to be at
the top of your game

470
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,679
when someone else
has all that--

471
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,805
all those
added ingredients.

472
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,307
- (whispering) I would
absolutely not say the mood

473
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,517
around here was
all pissed off.

474
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,561
If anything,
it was like,

475
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,979
you know, here we are--
just jealousy.

476
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,816
- It just gets hard not
to feel very vulnerable.

477
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,359
- Good morning, Tommy.

478
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,736
(Tom muttering)

479
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,158
- Tommy on several occasions
has tried to get Lex voted off.

480
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:15,328
He actually told Teresa that Lex
should be the next one to go,

481
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,998
unbeknownst to Lex or Ethan.

482
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:23,170
And he came to me and said
that if I have an opportunity,

483
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,171
it would be a good thing
to vote off Lex,

484
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,465
but he didn't want to
know anything about it.

485
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,933
- You know what?

486
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,226
- What?

487
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,521
- We made an alliance,
we got to stick with it.

488
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,940
What will be, will be.

489
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,902
And I don't know
no other way.

490
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,197
- Well, the other way is what
we said-- we get Lex off.

491
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,073
- He's going to be
hard to beat in immunity.

492
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,160
- Oh, yeah.
- 'Cause he's strong.

493
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,870
- I mean, doesn't the thought
of him winning again

494
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,747
piss you off?

495
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,667
I came into this game with
the attitude of winning

496
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,421
the whole thing,
and to do it in a fair way

497
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,882
and to do it beating
the best people

498
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,759
and going against
the best head-to-head.

499
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,432
- (whispering) Until today, I
don't think either of them

500
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,851
realized how much
of a threat he was.

501
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,936
Ethan included.

502
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,103
Ethan's like,
pissed now, you know?

503
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,565
- All of you want him gone,
but nobody wants to do it.

504
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,944
Kim said today that
she knows that the guys

505
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,112
have got such a strong alliance,
that she is the next to go.

506
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,406
I'm thinking to
myself, "Good for you.

507
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,991
Good for you, you're
finally thinking."

508
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,618
- You'd rather
go against Tom.

509
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,036
- He's always wanted
to got rid of Lex,

510
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,287
he just wouldn't do it.

511
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,082
And I said, "What if
Lex doesn't get immunity?"

512
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,042
and I can get Tom
to vote Lex off?

513
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,752
And she said
then she'd do that.

514
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,462
She said it's not too early
now to do that.

515
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,881
And I'm thinking, "Well, hey,
she's waking up a little bit."

516
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,740
- Well, ain't that nice.

517
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,826
What the hell is it?

518
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,787
A tisket, a tasket, I found
something in the basket.

519
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,998
- And look at
what you found.

520
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,832
- And look what
I found.

521
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,835
Pretty little basket.

522
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,503
Okay.

523
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,673
"Things are always easier
second time around.

524
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,717
"You are about to find out
if it's as true as it sounds.

525
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,971
"With the final four pending,
you don't want to lose,

526
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,850
or at the Tribal Council it
could be you that they choose."

527
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,980
This was in there.

528
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,481
I don't know if that has
anything to do--

529
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:48,982
I thought it
was a damn snake.

530
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,192
- What are those?

531
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,028
- Shells or beads.
- They're seeds.

532
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,988
- This immunity
challenge coming up

533
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,449
is certainly going to be the
most important for me.

534
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:57,866
- What's that
got to do with it?

535
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,076
- I don't know.

536
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,537
- I'm the last Samburu left,
so it would be easy for them

537
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,581
right now just to go ahead
and move me out.

538
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,876
- Or maybe it's something
totally different

539
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,587
and you got to run
through something twice.

540
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,715
- Whatever it is, I gotta
give it all I've got.

541
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,823
- Hello, you guys can
go ahead and fall in.

542
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,742
All right,
first things first, Big Tom.

543
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,911
Give it up, baby.

544
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,537
- I hate to.

545
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,247
Uh-oh, my nose is
a little large.

546
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,457
You want to
unbutton that, will you?

547
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,583
- Let me unhook that
for you.

548
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,584
- Thank you.
- All right.

549
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,753
- I hate to see it go.

550
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,049
- Immunity is back
up for grabs.

551
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,760
Today's challenge,
obviously a big one.

552
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,970
One of the qualities
required to do well

553
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,223
in this game of<i> Survivor</i>
is the ability

554
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,433
to learn from past mistakes.

555
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,102
Today you're gonna get
a second chance

556
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,896
at elements from
previous challenges.

557
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,399
Some are physical,
some are mental.

558
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,110
To win it, you'll have
to do well at all of them.

559
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,903
It starts with a
puzzle ladder.

560
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,988
Assemble the puzzle.

561
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,573
Use it to make
your way up to the net.

562
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,118
Go up one side of the net,
down the other.

563
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,829
You'll find a cart,
contains pieces to a puzzle.

564
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,789
Drag the cart over to
your puzzle platform

565
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,916
and assemble the puzzle.

566
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,127
You'll then make your way
under the ladder crawl

567
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,169
to your bow and arrows.

568
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,963
First person to hit
their target with an arrow

569
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,923
wins immunity.

570
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,300
Obviously this is
a big challenge.

571
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,636
Win this, you're in
the final four.

572
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,680
You guys are all
strong competitors.

573
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,597
This is game day.

574
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,725
Take your positions,
wait for my start.

575
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,647
Here we go,
immunity at stake.

576
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,441
Survivors ready?

577
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,609
Go!

578
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,135
(Tom groans)

579
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,181
- You guys are
all pretty even.

580
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,932
All four pins in.

581
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,081
That a way, Big Tom,
you're in it.

582
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,583
You're in it!

583
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,337
That a way, K.J.

584
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,178
You guys are
doing great.

585
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,055
You're all very even.

586
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,312
Playing smart, you're
thinking, not panicking.

587
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,441
That a way, Kim.

588
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,167
That's good,
Lex is done.

589
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,053
Lex is on
his last leg.

590
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,435
There it is!

591
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,108
Nice shot,
congratulations.

592
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,947
(<i> laughs</i> )

593
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,990
- Yeah!

594
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,914
- Lex, after a
temporary vacation,

595
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,251
evidently it likes this home
a little better.

596
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,586
Congratulations.
- Thank you, Jeff.

597
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,254
- Immunity tonight,
you are safe.

598
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,299
The other four,
somebody's going home.

599
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,091
Give you guys the afternoon
to think about it.

600
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,803
I'll see you at
Tribal Council.

601
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,952
- I feel close enough
to you, that I know

602
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,162
we're going to
see each other more.

603
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,040
We're going to talk.

604
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,626
- T. Bird approached me
before Tribal Council

605
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,502
and obviously needed to
have a heart-to-heart.

606
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,796
She is the odd person out
at this point.

607
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,715
She's the only
person that's left

608
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,592
that's from the original
Samburu.

609
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,011
Um, she's in
a mess of hurt.

610
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:14,182
Somehow we worked it out to
where everyone that's left

611
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,851
is a sweet person.

612
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,019
- Mm-hmm.

613
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,521
For me, it's I guess
kind of bittersweet.

614
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,522
I know that I'm going
to be the next one to go

615
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,025
unless I can think of
something real quick.

616
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,528
Just watch yourself.

617
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:32,533
Because even with alliances,
people have their own agendas.

618
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,910
- I know, I know.

619
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,204
- I had thought of every
different way I could play it.

620
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,414
And unfortunately, with Lex
getting immunity,

621
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,249
that cut down
a lot of my options,

622
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,543
and I really only had
one option to go,

623
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,380
and that was with
trying to get Lex

624
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,840
and Kim Johnson
to vote off Tom.

625
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,218
When I came over
to this tribe,

626
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,428
a little birdie
whispered something in my ear.

627
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,472
- T. Bird is obviously
struggling with something,

628
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,808
and so she said, "I need
you to sit down.

629
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,059
"I have something
I need to confess to you.

630
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,102
"I have something before
we go to Tribal Council

631
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,729
I need to tell you."

632
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,231
- Knowing pretty
sure I was gone,

633
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,942
I thought I don't have
anything to lose, anyway,

634
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,318
I'll go ahead and let him know
that I was the one

635
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,238
that put the vote against Lex.

636
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,492
- And she said, you know, "When
you got that one mystery vote,"

637
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,451
who at the time
I thought might be Kelly,

638
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:19,497
"I was the one that cast
that vote for you."

639
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,292
- The reason I changed my vote
was because before we left

640
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,713
for Tribal Council,
when we were in here,

641
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,425
somebody came up and whispered
to me, "Watch out for Lex."

642
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,259
- Who told you to
watch out for me?

643
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,928
- I can't tell you.

644
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,304
- Well, I sincerely
hope it was Kelly.

645
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,099
I said, well, there's not
more than a couple people

646
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,935
that it could be because you're
telling me to watch my back.

647
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:44,272
Did Tom tell you
not to trust me?

648
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,774
I mean, that's the only
person I can think of

649
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,943
that just, it all fits.

650
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:52,947
And she just looked at
me and went like this.

651
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,283
I don't understand.

652
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,744
In telling her that,
Tom is basically giving her

653
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,122
a green light that I was the
right person to vote for.

654
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,123
I just don't get it.

655
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,292
And I also found out,
you know, at that point,

656
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,419
Mama Cat told me that she
had also been approached

657
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,463
by Tom on more
than one occasion.

658
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,298
- He said, you know,
"If you vote Lex off,

659
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,133
"you know, it would
be good if you did it,

660
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,676
"but don't let me know
anything about it.

661
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,762
I don't want to know about it,
but it'd be a good thing to do."

662
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,680
And I said, if you want him off
so bad, let him vote him off.

663
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,015
- It's a pity.

664
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,809
- Tom wants Lex off, but he
says "I can't vote him,"

665
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,812
so he wants everybody else
to do the dirty work for him,

666
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,522
so he still looks
like the good guy.

667
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:31,277
- How many people on the jury
know that side of him?

668
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,445
- Nobody.
- Nobody.

669
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,114
- No.
- Well, that's a problem.

670
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,326
That's why I-- that's why
I'd have a hard time

671
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,494
going up against him.

672
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,537
- Well...

673
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,164
- Well, I appreciate
your telling me.

674
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,791
- Thanks for telling me.

675
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,375
- All right.

676
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:53,466
- Well, it just got way more--
way more sinister.

677
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,218
- Tommy's sort of insular
in his thinking.

678
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,845
Tommy's looking out for
Tommy most of the time.

679
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,555
Whatever Tommy wants
to do, Tommy does,

680
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,351
regardless of its
effect on other people.

681
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,896
- I don't,
but thank you.

682
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,690
Ultimately, I am responsible
for myself and nobody else.

683
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,026
It's completely
gone to cutthroat mode.

684
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:14,862
And if I think that Tom, if I
think that he's in a situation

685
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,322
where he is about to screw me
over and stab me in the back,

686
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,366
I'll cut his throat.

687
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,630
- We'll now bring
in our jury.

688
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,424
Up to four members now.

689
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,439
Well, I gotta call attention
to something I just noticed

690
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,734
when the jury walked in,
which is the shirt

691
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,569
that Kelly's wearing.

692
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,613
"Shameless," which I can
only imagine

693
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,531
is referring back
to last Tribal Council

694
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,784
when the whole notion of the
Walk of Shame came up.

695
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,786
Is that what you
guys feel as a group?

696
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,455
Is it a Walk of Shame?

697
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,166
- That was actually a
term that was coined

698
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,418
a long time ago and was
kind of the common term

699
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,295
that we all used
around the camp anyway.

700
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:58,966
It has nothing to do with that
being a shameful place to be,

701
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,594
that there being any
shame in being voted off

702
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,930
or being out of the tribe.

703
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:08,267
It was just a term we all
kind of coined and used freely

704
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,311
without really thinking
about what somebody

705
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,979
might interpret it as.

706
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,649
- Big Tom, does it
make you more aware

707
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,567
of what you are saying,
knowing the jury is listening,

708
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,486
or was that just
not a big deal

709
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,612
and you should
be blunt about it.

710
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,989
- It probably ought
to be a big deal,

711
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,325
but every one of them
on that jury knows me.

712
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,326
And they know if it comes
through my brain,

713
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,996
it'll come out
my mouth, and I--

714
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,373
I'm too old to change now.

715
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:34,835
I'm not going to change
for them or these or you.

716
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,005
I'm whom I am,
and that's it.

717
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,384
No, I'm going to say
whatever comes out

718
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,843
and I'll stand by it.

719
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,180
- Ethan, how acute
are your senses now

720
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,557
after being out with
no distractions

721
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,519
for over a month in Africa?

722
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,688
- Well, you know,
just not as sharp.

723
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,356
You know, mentally
you're not as sharp,

724
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,400
and you know, you
trip over things

725
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,193
that you weren't
tripping over before.

726
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,528
You know, now that I'm laying
on the ground, I'm thin.

727
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,531
You feel the ground
more than ever, you know.

728
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:08,202
Your ribs are sticking into the
earth, so in terms of that.

729
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,705
But mentally
I'm not sharp--

730
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,539
as sharp anymore.

731
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,667
I'm just, you know,
it's tough.

732
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,876
It wears on you.

733
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,585
You know,
you're tired all the time,

734
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,379
you're hungry
all the time.

735
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,840
You're-- you know,
so in that sense,

736
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,010
I think some of my acuteness
has gone far away.

737
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,386
- Teresa, I gotta bring up,

738
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,514
you're the last of
the original Samburu.

739
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,516
- I was hoping you wouldn't
notice that.

740
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,353
Actually, I was hoping
<i>they</i> wouldn't notice that.

741
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,438
- Well, do you think
they haven't?

742
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,856
- Yeah, they've noticed it.

743
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,735
You know, I feel like I
was lucky to be brought

744
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,530
into the old Boran tribe
earlier than the merge,

745
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,534
so I got to know,
especially Ethan and Kim.

746
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,871
You know, I never thought
I'd get to this point.

747
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,581
I never thought
I'd make the final five.

748
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,541
- All right, we're
going to vote in a minute.

749
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,084
Before we do, one
final question,

750
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,377
Tom, know who
you're voting for tonight?

751
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:58,878
- Mm-hmm.
- And do you have a game plan

752
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,588
from here on out?

753
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,590
- I might be that one
gets voted off tonight,

754
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:06,385
so you can't make a game plan
till after this thing's over.

755
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,805
I might-- I've got my bags
packed like everybody else.

756
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,099
You don't know in this game
when you're going

757
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,392
or when you're coming.

758
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,437
So I'm going-- I'll just
wait till it gets closer

759
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,105
and see what happens
after tonight.

760
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,315
- Okay, it's time to
vote.

761
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,483
K.J. you're up first.

762
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,416
- T. Bird, you've been
a good friend

763
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,211
and you've been my pleasure.

764
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,003
Keep that wonderful smile

765
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,965
'cause you are an
awful good girl.

766
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,967
See you around.

767
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,189
- It's with a heavy heart that
I cast this vote for you,

768
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,732
a really heavy heart.

769
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:20,459
- I'll go tally
the votes.

770
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,813
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

771
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,522
Person will be asked to leave
the Tribal Council area

772
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,690
immediately.

773
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,733
I'll read the votes.

774
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,240
First vote,
T. Bird.

775
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,242
It's you, Teresa.

776
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,126
T. Bird,
that's two for Teresa.

777
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,844
Three votes,
that's enough.

778
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,179
No need to read
the other two.

779
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,555
You need to
bring your torch.

780
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,348
- The fat lady's singing?

781
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,726
Afraid so.

782
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,489
- Teresa, the tribe
has spoken.

783
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,121
It's time for you to go.

784
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,498
- Bye.

785
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,300
- Well, here's what this
game has come down to.

786
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:56,639
Four people, three days,
two immunity challenges,

787
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,932
one Survivor.

788
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,642
You guys can head
back to camp.

789
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,228
I will see you tomorrow.

790
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,753
- This has been an absolute
experience of a lifetime.

791
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,754
I never dreamed
I'd make it

792
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,631
to be one of
the 16 survivors,

793
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,134
much less be one of the five
remaining survivors.

794
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,970
It's something I will,
of course, never forget.

795
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,763
I appreciate having the
opportunity to be here

796
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,640
and to experience
everything here in Africa.

797
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,768
Thank you for a wonderful
experience.
