<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,673
Peih-Gee picked Denise and Erik

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,466
to go with her on a reward to

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,388
the legendary Shaolin Temple...

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:14,597
...where Denise got to show

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,600
off her martial arts skills.

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,144
Back at camp, Amanda, Todd,

9
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,147
Courtney, and James made a final

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,023
four pact.

11
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:24,649
>> I've been the main guy trying

12
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,276
to hold this thing together, and

13
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,444
that's what I'm going to do.

14
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,653
>> PROBST: And because he had

15
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,237
both hidden immunity idols,

16
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,614
James was in the best position

17
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,115
to win it all.

18
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,909
At the immunity challenge...

19
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,787
Erik wins individual immunity.

20
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,247
...Erik a victory locked in

21
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,249
Peih-Gee as the next to go.

22
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,584
>> Get rid of Peih-Gee tonight,

23
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,126
and then after that focus on

24
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,712
getting rid of Erik, and then

25
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,296
it's all cake after that.

26
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,255
>> PROBST: But Amanda had other

27
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,256
ideas.

28
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,215
She hatched a plan to take out

29
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:55,180
James.

30
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,139
And everyone jumped at the

31
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,183
chance.

32
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,105
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

33
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,066
James trusted his alliance...

34
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,067
Once the votes are read the

35
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:08,985
decision is final.

36
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:09,819
...so he didn't play one of his

37
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,737
idols.

38
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,654
Tenth person voted out, and the

39
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,906
fourth member of our jury,

40
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,073
James.

41
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,241
By failing to recognize he was

42
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,284
in danger, the most powerful

43
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,203
player in the game was gone,

44
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,122
taking the idols with him.

45
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,457
James, the tribe has spoken.

46
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,792
Six are left.

47
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,294
Who will be voted out tonight?

48
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,302
>> I think that was the most

49
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,136
shocking tribal council yet.

50
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,056
I think that Jean-Robert got a

51
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:38,681
big kick out of James getting

52
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,099
voted out.

53
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:40,975
>> I think so, too.

54
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,727
>> He was like, "Do-do-do, they

55
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,103
got you, do-do-do."

56
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,313
>> "Wow," is all I have to say

57
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,607
about tribal council.

58
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,442
I was so nervous that idea

59
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,693
wouldn't work to vote James out,

60
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,238
and it did.

61
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,448
I wonder how mad James is right

62
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,491
now.

63
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,367
>> Lord, have mercy.

64
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,368
What did you say?

65
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,786
I was like, "I hope to god this

66
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,037
doesn't turn into a screaming

67
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,039
match back at the camp."

68
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:03,706
>> I said, "If this works, wow.

69
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,583
If it doesn't, I'm scared for my

70
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,751
life."

71
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,710
>> If it doesn't work and he

72
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,586
comes back here, I was like,

73
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,004
"Oh, my god, could you imagine

74
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:10,880
if he came back here?"

75
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,090
We would all be dead.

76
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:12,507
>> James is gone.

77
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,467
He didn't use the idols.

78
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,677
I'm still here.

79
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,095
I had a vote cast against me.

80
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,389
My heart was pounding.

81
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,143
We are in the top six.

82
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,143
>> How about we celebrate we are

83
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,311
in the top six?

84
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,397
>> Yay!

85
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,189
>> We'll bitch a little bit

86
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:28,439
tomorrow.

87
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,108
It will probably rain.

88
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:30,900
It will probably rain again.

89
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,860
>> Group hug, everybody.

90
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:32,652
>> Where is Peih-Gee?

91
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,695
Where is Peih-Gee?

92
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,155
>> Seeing original Fei Long

93
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:36,698
members turn on each other

94
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,075
absolutely gives me hope.

95
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,577
There must be a crack old tribal

96
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,912
lines somewhere, because Erik

97
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,205
and I are still around.

even two more people, we could

possibly cause a tie at tribal

104
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,175
council, which would be kind of

105
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,218
interesting.

I'm not giving up until I'm

107
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,304
voted out.

Courtney, Amanda, and Denise.

138
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,876
We want to get rid of Erik and

Peih-Gee.

140
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,837
That is the goal.

141

But at the same time, you can't

142
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,256
trust anybody 100% because in

143
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,424

Your sister Brandy's here.

pregnant, and she lost her baby,

225
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,677

00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,728
message you gave Todd is that

233
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,645

235
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:01,647
all right.

236

00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,972
>> PROBST: Take off your

384
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,141
blindfolds.

385
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,267
It's over.

386
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:06,976
All right, Denise and Robert.

387
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,852
Here's what's going to happen--

388
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,436
you're going to go out on a

389
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:08,769
boat.

390
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,604
You're going to have a nice

391
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,397
meal.

392
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,231
I'm going to turn this Sprint

393
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,315
phone on right now, because

394
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,316
you're going to get a phone

395
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,317
call.

396
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,277
Keep this phone turned on.

397
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,571
In addition, you're going to

398
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,822
choose two survivors to come

399
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,032
along with you and bring their

400
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,993
loved ones.

401
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,036
Who's the first survivor that

402
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,955
you're going to bring along with

403
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,081
their loved one?

404
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,000
>> Todd.

405
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,544
>> PROBST: Todd and his sister,

406
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,920
Brandy, are going with you.

407
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,882
Denise, you look pained to have

408
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,008
to make another decision.

409
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,801
>> This is a very tough decision

410
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,596
for me, Jeff.

411
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,848
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to

412
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,974
go with Amanda.

413
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,642
>> PROBST: Amanda and her sister

414
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,519
going on the reward.

415
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,937
>> Thank you!

416
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,064
Thank you so much.

417
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,859
>> PROBST: All right, the good

418
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,986
part of the reward is over.

419
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,614
Now comes the tough part.

420
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,823
Time for you guys to say good-

421
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,991
bye to your loved ones.

422
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,367
>> Good-bye.

423
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,453
>> Thanks for coming.

424
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,456
>> Okay.

425
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,167
>> PROBST: All right, Lawrence.

426
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,427
>> PROBST: All right, Erik,

427
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,053
Peih-Gee, Courtney, grab your

428
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,055
stuff, head back to camp.

429
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,350
>> Have fun, guys.

430
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,728
>> PROBST: Okay, there is one

431
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,355
more element to this reward.

432
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,232
When the afternoon is over, the

433
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,816
loved ones are going to spend

434
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,859
the night at your camp.

435
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,862
They're going to get a chance to

436
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,740
experience what you've been

437
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,242
living for 31 days.

438
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,368
Boat's waiting for you.

439
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,620
Have fun.

440
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,050
>> Oh, my god, there's ribs.

441
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,427
Oh, look at the chicken.

442
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,512
There's pizza.

443
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,846
>> There's pizza?

444
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,014
Are you serious?

445
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,266
>> Guys, dig in.

446
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,725
>> We have been eating off the

447
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,686
ground, literally.

448
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,979
>> Rip it apart.

449
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,272
>> You have never seen me eat

450
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,731
like this, have you?

451
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,107
>> Oh, my god.

452
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,066
>> How is it, honey?

453
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,901
Just for my husband to be here

454
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,027
in China... he's afraid to fly.

455
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,571
Just for him to come here, that

456
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,197
means a lot to me.

457
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,157
But to come here and compete and

458
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,493
to win a challenge together,

459
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,786
it's so uplifting.

460
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,413
I've been taken over the top.

461
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,914
>> Ah!

462
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:39,545
Oh, my god!

463
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,005
>> Oh, look at that!

464
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,339
>> That's Todd's piece right

465
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,133
there.

466
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,759
>> Do you want some?

467
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,177
>> Oh, hell, yeah, baby.

468
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,517
>> This is best chocolate cake I

469
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,059
have ever had in my life.

470
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,936
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

471
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,354
>> Your phone's ringing.

472
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,522
>> There's my call, hon.

473
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,150
>> There they are, look!

474
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,234
>> Say hello.

475
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,319
>> Hello?

476
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,945
>><i> Hi.</i>

477
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,030
>> All of a sudden I can hear

478
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,115
people crying in the background.

479
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,575
And it's my oldest daughter,

480
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,034
Erin.

481
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,244
>> Don't cry.

482
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,998
You've got to talk to me.

483
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,250
How did you guys do in the

484
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,960
tournament?

485
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,046
All right!

486
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,759
Daddy's here with me.

487
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,720
>> And I smell so bad.

488
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,140
>> Can you smell me from there?

489
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:37,978
>> Smell-a-vision.

490
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,356
>> I'm smiling just thinking

491
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,690
about you, sweet pea.

492
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,109
I think about you every day.

493
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,071
No, don't cry.

494
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:55,079
I miss you so much.

495
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,288
>> I love you, too.

496
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,539
You have a good night, okay?

497
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,624
And I'll see you really, really

498
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,833
soon.

499
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,127
>> I love you.

500
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:06,131
Good night, baby.

501
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,593
Being able to hear their voices

502
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,219
and have my husband here with me

503
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,429
today, it gives me the strength,

504
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,722
definitely, to keep on going,

505
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,057
and, I mean, I'm here to the

506
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,350
end.

507
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,559
I'm going to grab strength from

508
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,602
them and embrace it and just

509
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,270
keep on going.

510
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,113
>> I wonder why Denise picked

511
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,072
Amanda.

512
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,990
I'll be honest, I'm kind of

513
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,866
pissed that she didn't pick me,

514
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,742
because I took her off on a fat

515
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,244
reward.

516
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,121
>> I've got to get this off my

517
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,248
chest-- I do not believe Todd's

518
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,249
story.

519
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,334
>> I could not believe that

520
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,628
he... like, "Oh, my sister had

521
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,255
an unplanned teenage pregnancy,

522
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,173
and then a convenient

523
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,633
miscarriage."

524
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,676
Gee whiz.

525
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,593
You think the girl might not

526
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,845
want the entire world to know

527
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,096
about that.

528
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,764
>> Like, if it's true, my

529
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,306
deepest condolences to his

530
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,182
family.

531
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,143
>> I thought the same thing.

532
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,436
I was like, "Oh, how

533
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,520
convenient."

534
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,604
And then he was the first one

535
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,647
picked by Denise.

536
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,023
Right.

537
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,191
Todd was going for the Oscar

538
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,943
with his performance of "My

539
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,737
sister had a convenient

540
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,863
miscarriage."

541
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,447
And then of course Jeff was

542
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,907
like, "Todd, it looks like you

543
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,451
just got some bad news.

544
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,577
What happened?"

545
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,750
And Todd's like "My sister.

546
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,503
She was pregnant and she... she

547
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,296
lost the baby.

548
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,798
But it happened for a reason."

549
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,424
Like, that is not, like the fake

550
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,760
Johnny Fair Play, "My grandma

551
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,802
died."

552
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,803
You can almost forgive that.

553
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,346
That's funny.

554
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,454
>> What is that?

555
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,331
>> Shut up!

556
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,257
>> Indulge, kids!

557
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,259
Indulge!

558
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,597
>> Kinky!

559
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,723
>> When the loved ones showed

560
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,682
up, you know, we were

561
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,517
sourpusses.

562
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,518
We were pissed that we lost the

563
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,477
challenge, pissed we didn't get

564
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,603
to go.

565
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,646
I really didn't feel like

566
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,939
interacting with anybody.

567
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,190
>> I'm so bad with names.

568
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,441
Mr. Denise...

569
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,651
>> It's Robert.

570
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,111
>> So how proud are you of

571
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,363
Denise?

572
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,281
>> Very, very proud.

573
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,366
>> It was really tough.

574
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,242
And especially for me.

575
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,159
Like, I picked Denise to go with

576
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,369
me on a literally once-in-a-

577
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,871
lifetime reward trip, and, you

578
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,373
know, she didn't pick me.

579
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,292
And it sucks.

580
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:53,549
>> Amanda, how perfect it is

581
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,676
that we...

582
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,135
>> I know!

583
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,303
>> I can't believe it.

584
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,597
>> Really, we're just so lucky

585
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,348
that Denise got to pick two

586
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,475
people and she chose us.

587
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,518
>> Oh, my gosh!

588
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,311
>> So surreal.

589
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,563
>> And the other thing that

590
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,189
scared me was when I whispered

591
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,482
about Kim, you know, I was like,

592
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,567
"They're going to think I'm

593
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,277
lying, like I'm pulling a big

594
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,778
lie to see my sister."

595
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,321
Hopefully everybody believes it

596
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,407
because it wasn't a lie.

597
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,575
>> I'm so sorry about that.

598
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,659
>> You know, I know there's been

599
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,411
a lot of pointing at me as to a

600
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,287
strategic threat, but it was all

601
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,956
true.

602
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,124
It was all from the heart, you

603
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,083
know?

604
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:28,667
I wasn't out to be some snake

605
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,294
right there.

606
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,129
I really was concerned about my

607
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:32,337
home.

608
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,256
>> How pregnant was she?

609
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,841
>> She was about two months.

610
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,050
>> Three months now.

611
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,177
>> She lost it a while ago,

612
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,012
Todd.

613
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:40,762
>> Did she?

614
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,597
>> Yeah.

615
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,431
>> Like, right after I left?

616
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,933
>> Pretty much.

617
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,144
>> Seems like you're getting

618
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,103
along all right.

619
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:48,979
>> Yeah, know, everybody seems

620
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:49,813
to be okay.

621
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,731
You know, I mean, like I said,

622
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,982
there's a lot of young kids

623
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:52,608
here, and I don't have a lot in

624
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,442
common with them.

625
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,276
But we'll see what happens.

626
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,360
I mean, I can only hope that

627
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,237
Amanda and Todd stay with me,

628
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,156
and we go to the final three.

629
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,283
If they backstab me and take

630
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,576
Courtney, that's one of the

631
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,619
chances I'm going to have to

632
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,578
take.

633
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,246
But, I mean, to be out here all

634
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,206
this time is still pretty damn

635
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,166
good.

636
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,208
>> Yeah.

637
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,001
Play your game, that's all.

638
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,294
Do what you... do what you think

639
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,795
is right.

640
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,130
>> I mean, obviously, it's not a

641
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,173
good idea for us to backstab

642
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,383
anyone anymore, but I think as

643
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,426
long as we take Denise to the

644
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,261
final four she'll understand.

645
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,930
>> Would you vote out Denise

646
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,222
before Courtney, or no?

647
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,182
>> Yeah.

648
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,266
>> Because we can win better...

649
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,351
>> She works hard all week.

650
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,436
I mean, she has kids.

651
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,771
>> I freaking love Denise.

652
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,271
I do.

653
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,273
>> The thing is, in the final

654
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,274
three, she will play her sob

655
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,442
story.

656
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,568
>> That's right.

657
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,737
We... like, Amanda, and I and

658
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,739
Courtney are all pretty much on

659
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,448
the same level, because we've

660
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,449
pissed a lot of the people on

661
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,325
the jury off.

662
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,326
And so, like, it's a pretty even

663
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,369
chance between all of us.

664
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,453
So I'm like...

665
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,412
>> And we would make such a cute

666
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,288
final three.

667
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,501
>> Oh, you guys can do this.

668
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,627
>> Yeah.

669
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,753
>> You got it.

670
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,671
>> Perfect.

671
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,380
>> It's like a dream.

672
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,507
>> Perfect.

673
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,992
>> I know you'll do good.

674
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,034
>> I'm going to do my best.

675
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,036
>> Easily into the one or two

676
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,288
spot.

677
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,711
You know what you're doing.

678
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,670
>> Mm-hmm.

679
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,922
>> I love you.

680
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:39,548
My god, you smell bad.

681
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,465
>> I know.

682
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm so sorry.

683
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:42,551
I stink.

684
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,510
>> I've got to smell just as

685
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,511
bad, though.

686
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,387
>> You're getting there, honey.

687
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,139
You're fitting right in with

688
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,933
this group, I tell you.

689
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,439
>> 32 days.

690
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,151
I can make it a few more.

691
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,945
Tell everyone I miss them, okay?

692
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,993
>> I love you.

693
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,538
>> See you in a few days, okay?

694
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,419
>> It kills you to say good-bye

695
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,795
to loved ones, but you can't

696
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,547
stop the game, because the game

697
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,423
keeps going.

698
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,592
So you want to feel comfortable,

699
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,676
and you want to feel like you

700
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,053
can trust people, and you just

701
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,638
can't, though.

702
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,973
You've got to keep on your toes.

703
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,099
You've got to keep yourself

704
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,309
nervous, or else you're going to

705
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,394
get screwed.

706
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,952
>> No, I know.

707
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,913
I could see it, you know.

708
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,418
It wasn't my fault.

709
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,337
You know, it just happened to

710
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:00,754
work out that way.

711
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:01,505
I don't want to be the next one

712
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,589
to go.

713
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,716
>> After the loved ones left,

714
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,093
Denise came over and

715
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:06,718
tried to kind of fix that little

716
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,513
problem that she might have with

717
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,140
me, like, not getting picked.

718
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,450
>> I do feel a little better

719
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,535
that at least she took the time

720
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,370
to come talk to me.

721
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,579
I might need her vote if I can

722
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,664
convince her to try to vote

723
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,126
somebody else off.

724
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,799
>> I mean, I just wanted to see

725
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,758
where you're standing, and I

726
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,759
wanted you to see where I'm

727
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,718
coming from, you know what I

728
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,803
mean?

729
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,804
>> Right now I'm going to

730
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:51,805
concentrate on gathering up all

731
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,056
my energy and focus on winning

732
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,015
that challenge, because I really

733
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,142
need it.

734
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,394
Every time since the merge, I

735
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,563
feel like I need to win.

736
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,697
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

737
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,913
You guys ready to get to today's

738
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:17,873
immunity challenge?

739
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,874
>> Yes.

740
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,833
>> PROBST: First things first.

741
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,960
Erik, give it up.

742
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:30,927
Once again, immunity is back up

743
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,722
for grabs.

744
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,015
You are going to have to dig

745
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,474
deep, as today's challenge will

746
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,893
test you both physically and

747
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,686
mentally.

748
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,355
For today's challenge, you'll be

749
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,773
attached to a rope which snakes

750
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,442
through a series of obstacles.

751
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,902
At each obstacle, you must

752
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,278
untangle your rope by either

753
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,696
moving over, under, or around

754
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,241
each post in order to continue.

755
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:53,867
At the end of the course, you'll

756
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,369
find a set of boxes.

757
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,537
Each box contains one true and

758
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,706
one false statement about

759
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,500
Chinese inventions.

760
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,002
Next to each statement is a key.

761
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,004
Choose the statement you think

762
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,381
is true, grab the key, race back

763
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:08,757
to the start.

764
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,718
If you're right, your key will

765
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,303
open a lock.

766
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:13,929
If you're wrong, you have to go

767
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:14,679
back and try again.

768
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,598
First person to answer three

769
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,807
questions correctly and open

770
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,143
three locks will raise their

771
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:20,727
flag.

772
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,896
First person to raise their flag

773
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,981
wins immunity, guaranteed a one-

774
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,691
in-five shot at winning this

775
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,820
game.

776
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,072
We'll get started.

777
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,658
Head up on the deck.

778
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,080
Here we go, for immunity.

779
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,623
Survivors ready?

780
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,958
Go!

781
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,334
You are attached to a rope that

782
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,254
runs the length of this course.

783
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:47,629
Erik flies over.

784
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,590
Amanda's over.

785
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,343
Todd making quick work of it.

786
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:53,718
Denise is over.

787
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,720
Todd and Amanda making their way

788
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,514
through the swamp.

789
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,516
Peih-Gee's right there.

790
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,642
Todd first up the mountain.

791
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,686
Amanda right behind.

792
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,562
Erik snagged on one of the

793
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,605
posts.

794
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,147
It's Todd and Amanda in the

795
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,774
lead.

796
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:16,992
Todd and Amanda both untying

797
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:17,826
their first box.

798
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,203
There are two statements.

799
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,413
One is true, one is false.

800
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:25,583
Todd has his first key.

801
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:32,632
Amanda has her first key.

802
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,926
Peih-Gee's made her first

803
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,136
choice.

804
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,429
Todd going to pass Erik as he

805
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,888
heads to the start.

806
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,140
Amanda heading back to the start

807
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:40,849
with her first key.

808
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,184
Peih-Gee heading back into the

809
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,394
swamp with her first key.

810
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,020
Big question for Todd-- did he

811
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,439
choose the true statement?

812
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,442
Will the key open a lock?

813
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,860
And it does.

814
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,989
Todd has his first lock open.

815
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,157
Todd and Amanda both have one

816
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,408
lock undone.

817
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,993
Two locks left.

818
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,286
Courtney struggling to get back

819
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,662
with her first key.

820
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,747
Erik trying to get back in it.

821
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,291
Todd still in the lead.

822
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,542
Amanda right behind.

823
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,126
Peih-Gee back with her first

824
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:13,048
key.

825
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,132
Peih-Gee has her first lock

826
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,008
open.

827
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:15,884
She's heading back for her

828
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,760
second.

829
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,011
Todd, Amanda, Peih-Gee, all have

830
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,220
one lock open.

831
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,722
Denise and Erik struggling to

832
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,726
stay in it.

833
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,811
Todd at his second box.

834
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,480
Amanda at her second box.

835
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,190
Choose the one you think is true

836
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,816
and grab the key.

837
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,735
Amanda and Todd both with their

838
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,778
second keys.

839
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,696
Erik trying to stay in this

840
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,865
challenge for immunity.

841
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:43,036
First lock doesn't open.

842
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,455
Second lock doesn't open.

843
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,792
Third lock doesn't open.

844
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,419
Erik now in dead last.

845
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,712
Todd and Amanda neck and neck as

846
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:57,425
they head back into the swamp.

847
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,635
Peih-Gee heading back with her

848
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,346
second key.

849
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,264
Todd opens his second lock.

850
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:03,807
Todd has only one lock left.

851
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,434
Amanda trying her key in the

852
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,812
first lock.

853
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,105
It does not work.

854
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,524
Trying it in the remaining lock.

855
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,942
It does not work.

856
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,735
This gives Todd a huge lead.

857
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,113
Peih-Gee back with her second

858
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,572
key.

859
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,282
Did she choose right?

860
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,367
She did.

861
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,535
It's Peih-Gee and Todd with two

862
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,744
locks open, one lock left.

863
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,829
Amanda still fighting, hoping

864
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,164
Todd will make a mistake.

865
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,792
Peih-Gee right on Todd's tail.

866
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,879
Todd has two statements left.

867
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,839
If he chooses the true statement

868
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,924
he'll have his third and final

869
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,342
key.

870
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:39,884
Todd has made his choice.

871
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,011
The question is, did he choose

872
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,471
the right statement?

873
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,722
Peih-Gee now opening her third

874
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,807
box.

875
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,975
You want a guarantee you go

876
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,102
final five, you keep fighting.

877
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:54,566
Peih-Gee has made her choice.

878
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,859
Todd and Peih-Gee both have

879
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,110
their third keys.

880
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,571
With that third key in hand, if

881
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,906
he is right, Todd wins immunity.

882
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,283
If he's wrong, it oppose the

883
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,743
door for Peih-Gee.

884
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,874
It does not open.

885
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,335
It's taken every bit of strength

886
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,254
Peih-Gee has left to get back

887
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,381
with that third key.

888
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,010
If she's right, it was worth it.

889
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,261
If she answered correctly, she

890
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,264
will open the lock.

891
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,977
She does.

892
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,395
And with that, Peih-Gee wins

893
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,814
immunity!

894
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,616
Peih-Gee, come on over.

895
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,950
>> I never would have believed

896
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,452
it.

897
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,495
>> PROBST: For the second time,

898
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,496
Peih-Gee wins individual

899
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,873
immunity.

900
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,502
You are safe tonight at tribal

901
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,544
council, guaranteed a spot in

902
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,795
the final five.

903
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,881
Denise, Todd, Courtney, Amanda,

904
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,133
Erik, after 33 days, this game

905
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,301
will come to an end for one of

906
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,344
you.

907
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,261
See you tonight at tribal

908
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,346
council.

909
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,932
Head on back to camp.

910
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,658
>> You know, honestly, like, I

911
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,784
can't believe I won.

912
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,285
I'm still crying about it.

913
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,995
Wow.

914
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:31,871
I've been, like, underdog this

915
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,958
whole time I've been here.

916
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,501
Every council that I'm not

917
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,544
wearing the necklace, I expect

918
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,545
to be voted out, you know, so...

919
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,839
>> Erik, come to the table.

920
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,009
The muddy rice is ready.

921
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,553
>> This is probably one of, like

922
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,554
my proudest moments, like, I've

923
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,596
ever had in my entire life.

924
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,890
I'm safe tonight, but it's been,

925
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,308
like, really mentally and

926
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,435
physically exhausting.

927
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,198
>> I'm okay.

928
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,411
The only thing that would be a

929
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,370
surprise is if Amanda would

930
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,288
turn.

931
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:13,913
But she won't, because she knows

932
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,124
if Erik or Peih-Gee get even

933
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,293
close to the end, they've got

934
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,211
it.

935
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,547
So...

936
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,048
It seemed so obvious to me, at

937
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,217
least, when Peih-Gee won

938
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,010
immunity, who else is going to

939
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,928
go tonight?

940
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,137
Erik.

941
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,054
It's probably the easiest vote

942
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,473
for me so far.

943
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,934
>> I feel like, even if I were

944
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,769
on Todd's side, I would feel a

945
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,896
little shaded out, just by not

946
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,443
trusting him with, like, that...

947
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,069
what I think is false

948
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,114
information about his sister.

949
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,116
>> He could very well have,

950
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,117
like, played that up as, you

951
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,619
know, a way to get further in

952
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,870
the game.

953
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,495
It's what it sounded like to me,

954
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,080
too.

955
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,875
>> The hard part for me is that

956
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,294
nobody here trusts Todd.

957
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,379
It irks me, because I've thrown

958
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,088
his name out, and it's like,

959
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,299
"Okay, well, if you don't trust

960
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,092
him, then what's the deal?"

961
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,261
I feel like I have to fight.

962
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,473
But I don't know what to do.

963
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,649
>> Thanks.

964
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,359
>> I'll talk to Denise.

965
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,361
>> My plan for tonight, is Erik

966
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,779
and I are going to vote for

967
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,197
Todd, and hope that Denise

968
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,783
swings for a tie.

969
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,353
>> If she votes Erik out now,

970
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,437
it's highly likely she'll end up

971
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,063
in fourth place.

972
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,482
If she tries to force a tie and

973
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,901
Todd gets voted out tonight,

974
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,277
suddenly her chances of getting

975
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,030
to top three are much better.

976
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,521
>> I will.

977
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,231
Denise isn't stupid, though.

978
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,275
>> This tribal council right

979
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,234
here is definitely a turning

980
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,318
point in the game.

981
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,655
If I do switch and head to that

982
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,365
side of the coin, are my chances

983
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,533
better?

984
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,868
Probably.

985
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,035
But am I going to win against

986
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,036
one of those two?

987
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,037
I don't know.

988
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,748
I mean, it's just... right now

989
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,332
it's, like, a 50-50 split.

990
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,353
>> Oh, that cold wind.

991
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,354
I hate that cold wind.

992
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,397
That means it's about to start

993
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,483
in my...

994
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,785
>> I trust you, I do.

995
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,869
>> I'm definitely the swing vote

996
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:40,912
tonight.

997
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,163
For me, personally, I mean, this

998
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,289
is do or die.

999
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,665
When I get up there, I mean, I

1000
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,792
don't know right now who I'm

1001
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,043
going to pick.

1002
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,836
What happens when I come back to

1003
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,504
camp after I make this decision?

1004
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,631
Who's going to be flipping out?

1005
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,799
This is a game for a million

1006
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,008
dollars, and right now, writing

1007
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,301
someone's name down is a

1008
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,053
million-dollar signature.

1009
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,055
>> It's going to be the longest

1010
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,306
wait of my life.

1011
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:04,393
>> I'm a little nervous.

1012
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,937
I'm a little scared.

1013
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,188
I'm a little in turmoil.

1014
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,147
I'm a little flipping out.

1015
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,191
Thunder and lightning is getting

1016
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,318
closer, the decision's getting

1017
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,986
closer, my mind is racing.

1018
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,738
This is just insane.

1019
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,989
I don't know.

1020
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,449
I just don't know what to do.

1021
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,868
Can you help me?

1022
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:41,639
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1023
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,392
the members of our jury.

1024
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,353
Jaime, Jean-Robert, Frosti, and

1025
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,772
James, voted out at the last

1026
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,440
tribal council.

1027
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,198
Let's talk about the reward

1028
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,616
challenge.

1029
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,701
Amanda, after spending the

1030
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,161
afternoon with Denise and seeing

1031
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,912
her and her husband interact,

1032
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,914
did you feel like you knew

1033
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,415
Denise in a different way?

1034
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,500
>> Oh, definitely.

1035
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,751
I think she's blessed with a

1036
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,419
great life-- like, a great

1037
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,504
family, a great bond with her

1038
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,339
kids.

1039
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,799
It was just nice to see that

1040
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,884
part of Denise, like the softer

1041
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,342
side of Denise.

1042
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,304
>> PROBST: Denise, is there a

1043
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,889
downside to everybody seeing

1044
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,640
what a great life you have?

1045
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,058
>> Oh, definitely.

1046
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,226
I mean, it's a two-way street--

1047
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,352
yes, it's a good thing to let

1048
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,437
them see a little bit, but it's

1049
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,521
bad because maybe they won't

1050
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,689
vote for me, or maybe they feel

1051
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,691
a little scared to let me go

1052
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,318
against them in the finals.

1053
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,360
>> PROBST: Why would they not

1054
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,278
want to go against you in the

1055
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,321
finals?

1056
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,239
>> I don't know if they would

1057
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,449
vote for someone who already has

1058
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,409
a good, experienced life, and

1059
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,660
give them a million dollars.

1060
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,662
You know, maybe I'll get a

1061
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,706
sympathy vote or maybe I'll get

1062
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,874
more votes on the jury because

1063
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:50,875
of that.

1064
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,001
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee, for the

1065
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,294
last several tribal councils,

1066
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,420
it's either going to have been

1067
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:59,425
you or Erik voted out.

1068
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,760
What's your take on tonight's

1069
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,011
vote?

1070
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,804
Do you think there is a strong

1071
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,972
consensus of what's going to

1072
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,265
happen, or do you think there's

1073
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,642
a lot of ambiguity going on?

1074
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,894
>> I think there's definitely

1075
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,563
some ambiguity going on.

1076
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,272
You know, if you want to look at

1077
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,483
it as us being two against four,

1078
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,859
one person is at the very

1079
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,944
bottom.

1080
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,654
And I don't see why they would

1081
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,364
make that leap and be like, "I

1082
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,573
don't want to be fourth.

1083
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,241
I want to be first, possibly."

1084
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,160
It could turn the game around

1085
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,954
entirely for one or two people,

1086
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,580
you know, and so it's something

1087
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,082
that everybody's going to have

1088
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:31,707
to take into consideration very

1089
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,668
carefully.

1090
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,127
>> PROBST: Denise, does the talk

1091
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,922
of the vote being up in the air

1092
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,257
concern you?

1093
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,257
>> Yeah.

1094
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,259
I mean, there's three people

1095
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:41,842
over there, there's two people

1096
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,344
here, and I mean, I always feel

1097
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,470
like I'm on the bottom of the

1098
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,554
barrel.

1099
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,764
Yeah, I'm really, really scared.

1100
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,432
But I mean, hopefully tonight's

1101
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,600
the night that I can trust

1102
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,643
people.

1103
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,144
So to get a little further in

1104
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,354
the game would be great.

1105
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,772
I want to stay here for as long

1106
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,190
as I can.

1107
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:57,525
So, I mean, I'm just going to

1108
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,985
hope for the best.

1109
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,486
>> PROBST: Todd, is there

1110
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,780
anybody here that you trust?

1111
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,032
>> Yes, I do trust people here.

1112
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,409
I have to, because I'm not

1113
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,328
wearing that necklace.

1114
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,705
So I feel like I do trust

1115
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,914
people, yeah.

1116
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,291
I just don't know exactly 100%

1117
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:14,542
how much.

1118
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,378
>> PROBST: Erik, if it's you

1119
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,504
tonight, have you done

1120
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,797
everything you can to try and

1121
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,507
crack this other four?

1122
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,217
>> Yeah.

1123
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,136
Honestly, like, I want... I want

1124
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,721
to be here tomorrow.

1125
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,889
And I hope people realize if

1126
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,432
there's four and two, there

1127
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,350
could be three and three, and

1128
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,685
all of a sudden you're not

1129
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,644
fourth.

1130
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,520
You're in the top three and

1131
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,396
you've got a chance to win the

1132
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,689
million dollars.

1133
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,440
And I'm playing that card.

1134
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,524
I mean that is... that is all

1135
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,359
I've got left.

1136
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,402
>> PROBST: Let's get to the

1137
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:41,610
vote.

1138
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,486
Peih-Gee, you have individual

1139
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,446
immunity.

1140
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,073
You can give it up, if you want.

1141
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:46,699
You cannot vote for Peih-Gee.

1142
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,575
Everybody else is fair game.

1143
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,493
It's time to vote.

1144
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,620
Amanda, you're up.

1145
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,466
>> It's either going to be me or

1146
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:03,758
you tonight.

1147
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,426
I'm not ready to go.

1148
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,803
So...

1149
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:23,903
>> Too many people said they

1150
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,404
couldn't trust you.

1151
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,823
Sorry.

1152
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:36,916
>> I'm sorry I have to do this.

1153
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:37,583
This is probably the biggest

1154
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,542
mistake I'm going to make in

1155
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,587
this game.

1156
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,892
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1157
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,103
votes.

1158
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,445
Once the votes are read, the

1159
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:06,821
decision is final.

1160
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,530
The person voted out will be

1161
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,531
asked to leave the tribal

1162
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,616
council area immediately.

1163
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,077
I'll read the votes.

1164
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,913
First vote, Erik.

1165
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,544
Todd.

1166
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,548
One vote Erik, one vote Todd.

1167
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,341
Todd.

1168
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,592
Todd.

1169
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,053
Two votes Todd, one vote Erik.

1170
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,559
Erik.

1171
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,353
Two votes Erik, two votes Todd.

1172
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,649
Erik.

1173
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,693
That's three votes Erik, two

1174
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,529
votes Todd, one vote left.

1175
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,413
11th person voted out, and the

1176
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,206
fifth member of our jury, Erik.

1177
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,417
You need to bring me your torch.

1178
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,640
Erik, the tribe has spoken.

1179
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,726
Time for you to go.

1180
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,865
>> PROBST: Well, based on what I

1181
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,824
heard tonight, it sound like

1182
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:34,909
you're all battling the same

1183
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,619
question-- "Do I take somebody

1184
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,412
with me simply because I think I

1185
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:40,539
can beat them or do I take with

1186
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,874
me somebody I think is most

1187
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,500
deserving because I showed I

1188
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,252
wanted to beat the best?"

1189
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,712
It could be a million dollar

1190
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,088
decision.

1191
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,131
Grab your torches.

1192
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,007
Head back to camp.

1193
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,092
Good night.

<i>Survivor...</i>

1204
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:14,657
>> Are we getting extreme

1205
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,493
<i>Survivor</i> paranoia right now?

1206
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,452
>> PROBST: Amanda targets Todd.

1207
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:19,453
>> I could pull Peih-Gee and

1208
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:20,538
Denise together.

1209
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,163
>> PROBST: But Todd fights back.

1210
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,958
>> An angry Todd is a bad Todd.

1211
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:24,792
>> I will be pissed off.

1212
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,961
>> PROBST: As alliances crumble,

1213
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,337
no one is safe.

1214
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,547
>> I hope you guys vote to knock

1215
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,422
off Todd.

1216
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,549
I'd like to see that happen.

1217
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,180
>> I wanted to go all the way to

1218
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,099
the top in this game, but,

1219
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,267
unfortunately, today was my day.

1220
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:41,850
I think I can always look back

1221
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,228
and say, "Well, I could have

1222
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,354
done this differently or I could

1223
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,438
have done that," but I'm

1224
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,773
mentally and physically and

1225
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,607
emotionally exhausted.

1226
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,067
I made it 33 days.

1227
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,068
I'm really proud of myself.

1228
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,444
The five remaining contestants

1229
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,070
are going to battle it out, and

1230
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:53,696
I'm really curious to see who

1231
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,738
comes out on top.
