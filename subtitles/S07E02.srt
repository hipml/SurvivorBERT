00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,919
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,922
Survivor:
Deep in the Pearl Islands,

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,049
16 Americans were surprised
by an all-new beginning

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,927
to the game.
You're going into this game with

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,723
nothing but the clothes you
have on your backs, just like

6
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:19,769
if you really were shipwrecked.
Split into two tribes,

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,480
Morgan and Drake,
they were given

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,983
100 Panamanian dollars
and a chance to barter

9
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,985
for supplies.
>> How much?

10
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,903
>> PROBST: The Morgan Tribe
scattered and argued with

11
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,114
the locals.
>> Give me my money back.

12
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,283
I don't want it.
>> PROBST: The Drakes fared

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,827
better with the help of
Sandra, who spoke Spanish...

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,996
>><i> Aquel me dijo dos Balboa.</i>
>> PROBST: ...and Rupert,

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,292
who pirated Morgan's shoes.
>> Pirates pillage.

16
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,586
>> PROBST: With their new
supplies, the tribes set out

17
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,505
for their separate islands.
At their camp, the Morgans

18
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,091
continued to struggle,
this time with shelter

19
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,260
and water.
>> They say we'll go later

20
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,637
for the water.
Personally, we need to do it

21
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,973
now.
>> PROBST: At Drake,

22
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,185
Burton caught the first fish,
but Rupert showed him up

23
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,145
by bringing in a bounty.
>> I'm coming out here

24
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,481
to be the caretaker
and I think I'm doing it.

25
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,316
>> PROBST: At the first
immunity challenge...

26
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,193
Survivors ready?
Go!

27
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,320
...it was a close race
at the finish,

28
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,490
but the Drakes
pulled off a narrow victory.

29
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,658
Drake wins immunity!
The Morgan Tribe blamed

30
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,453
their loss on skinny Ryan.
>> That sucked.

31
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,122
Skinny Ryan, he just hasn't
been pulling his weight at camp

32
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,291
or at the challenge.
>> PROBST: And Tijuana got wind

33
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,168
of Nicole's last-minute
plotting.

34
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,463
>> You're not listening.
He told me, so I came

35
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,216
directly to you.
>> PROBST: At their first

36
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,510
tribal council, Nicole's
troublemaking caused her to be

37
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,679
the first person
voted out of the Pearl Islands.

38
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,099
Nicole, the tribe
has spoken.

39
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,728
15 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

40
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,241
>> When it comes time for night,
it's breaking us down.

41
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,912
Um, it's breaking me down,
I know.

42
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,289
It's very hard to not be able
to sleep.

43
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:31,127
It's very hard
to freeze every night.

44
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,338
And there's nothing you can do
about it.

45
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,256
The wind is coming...
you don't have any control.

46
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,802
It's beating all of us up.
It's freezing out here.

47
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,180
>> We need to... we need to get
a strong enough fire

48
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,975
that we'll be able
to get some heat.

49
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,645
I mean, I'm not expecting it
to be any Holiday Inn.

50
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,939
I mean, clearly not.
Just shivering every night,

51
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,982
that, that, uh...
that gets me.

52
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,318
And I know it's... to me,
it seems like it's only

53
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,986
a matter of time
before, you know,

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,613
something like pneumonia
or something like that

55
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,490
could settle in.
'Cause, I don't have

56
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,494
any clothes.
>> ( sighs ): Good night.

57
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,122
>> Good night.
>> Come on.

58
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,751
What's going on here?
( laughing )

59
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:17,382
A springboard for my head.
>> One of my biggest concerns

60
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,426
has been sleep deprivation.
We had one to two hours total

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,346
in three nights.
And, uh, you know, if we

62
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,516
don't solve that problem,
people are going

63
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:34,357
to start hallucinating.
>> Last night, I don't...

64
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,651
I don't even remember sleeping.
You know, I think I'm going

65
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,736
to be able to go.
Once I get a few bottles

66
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,655
of water in me
and a little bit of food,

67
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,324
I should be fine.
But I got to find a plan

68
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,662
for me, 'cause this isn't
working for me.

69
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:54,335
I'm going to try and come up
with a backup plan.

70
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,588
>> Skinny Ryan, his best day
doesn't equate to what I can do

71
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,384
on my worst day.
That's no knock on him.

72
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,720
It's just, physically,
he just has nothing to offer.

73
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,222
He just doesn't have
what it takes to...

74
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:19,360
to get it done.
>> Last night was 1,000 times

75
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,322
better than the night before.
>> As far as sleep goes?

76
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,991
>> As far as my whole
state of mind.

77
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,036
>> Yeah.
>> I am loving life

78
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,748
and loving this place
and loving the position I'm in.

79
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,377
I am in paradise.
What more do I want?

80
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,922
I'm living in a bounty of food.
I've got beautiful souls

81
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,593
around me.
>> You're doing a great job.

82
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,763
>> Oh, you are, too.
And I've got some help

83
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:52,351
being strong.
People are not

84
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,773
truly lazy per se.
People are having a hard time

85
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:04,447
in paradise.
( laughing )

86
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,283
>> Just jackass.
Did you not learn

87
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,785
how much is in
a coconut by now?

88
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,287
>> There's still a lot
in there, but maybe it's like,

89
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:21,798
uh, coconut oil.
Maybe it's like suntan lotion.

90
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,426
>> I love being in the middle
of a gigantic fish tank.

91
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,013
I love being able to go out
and, in a couple of hours,

92
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:39,107
bring a sack of fish home.
>> Okay, Burton...

93
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,320
bring a sack of fish home.
>> Okay, Burton...

94
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,322
>> Yo.
>> When it came back

95
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,449
today, it was... it was kind
of loose.

96
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,159
>> Yeah, I tightened it.
And when I was

97
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,203
spear-fishing yesterday, this
thing fell all the way off.

98
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,997
>> Oh, really?
>> Make sure that's always

99
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,958
tight, and when you're fishing,
check that and make sure

100
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,127
that's tight.
If we lose that...

101
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,504
>> I try to check in between.
>> ...we got no tools

102
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,214
to tighten it with.
>> Yeah.

103
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,217
It's more of a pain in the ass
for me to give him my spear

104
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,345
and worry about it being lost
or being, you know, broken

105
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,140
or whatever where I...
then I will be in trouble

106
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,143
because that's my food.
I need to eat meat.

107
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,354
>> That's pretty good, huh?
>> Man...

108
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,523
>> ( sighs ): I don't know if
I can eat anymore.

109
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,860
This is great.
>> Guys, that is yummy.

110
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:34,996
>> I'm full.
>> Tree mail, tree mail.

111
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,374
What, what?
The tree mail.

112
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,210
Ah, tree mail.
Oh, we just got some tree mail.

113
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,882
It's a big one for us.
And a super big one for me.

114
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,217
There may not be more pressure
for any survivor

115
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,220
in the history of<i> Survivor</i> to do
well at a challenge than me.

116
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,515
"Stormy weather,
ran ships aground

117
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,226
Most fortunes were lost,
A few, they were found

118
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,354
Salvage the quickest,
silver and gold,

119
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,191
You'll then be rewarded
like pirates of old."

120
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,027
( cheering )
>> There's all this talk

121
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,363
about how I didn't give 100%
in the last challenge.

122
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,449
And what really sucks is,
I gave more than 100%.

123
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,327
So now, I've got to come up
with some kind of extra,

124
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,456
extra strength that I may...
may not even have harnessed away

125
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:26,047
in this poor little body.
>> PROBST: Come on in, Drake.

126
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,219
Take a spot on your mat.
Morgan, come on in.

127
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,430
Drake, getting your first look
at the new Morgan Tribe,

128
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,059
minus Nicole, voted out
at the first Tribal Council.

129
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,353
Okay.
You ready for today's challenge?

130
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,271
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.

131
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,232
>> Big time.
>> PROBST: It is for a reward

132
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,442
and here's how it works.
Scattered along

133
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,237
the ocean floor,
marked by floating buoys,

134
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,490
are five treasure items.
One at a time,

135
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,617
a member from each tribe's
going to swim out,

136
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,621
dive down and retrieve an item.
There is also a treasure chest

137
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,123
on the ocean floor.
Once your tribe has all five

138
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,167
items in that chest,
and the fifth person

139
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,629
is back here at the start,
your entire tribe will then race

140
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,839
out, return the treasure chest.
First tribe to get

141
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,175
their treasure chest up
on the platform wins reward.

142
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,261
Want to know
what you're playing for?

143
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,762
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.

144
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,931
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: It's two parts.

145
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,475
There's a shovel and a key.
These are yours to keep.

146
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,227
>> Yes!
>> All right!

147
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,020
>> This is nice.
>> PROBST: Buried on each

148
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,482
of your islands somewhere
is a treasure chest

149
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:31,654
with enough bounty to last you
for a long, long time.

150
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,448
The reward for today's
challenge: first clue,

151
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,326
piece of the map that will lead
you to your treasure chest.

152
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,161
This is the first
of three clues.

153
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,499
The winning tribe will also get
to loot, that is steal,

154
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,459
one item
from the other tribe's camp.

155
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,170
This will apply to all future
tribal reward challenges.

156
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,715
So you have something extra
to play for now.

157
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,675
Ready to get this going?
>> Yeah.

158
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,343
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.

159
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,013
>> PROBST: All right, Drake,
because you have one extra

160
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,015
member, you're sitting somebody
out-- who's sitting out?

161
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,183
Sandra, take a seat
on the bench.

162
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,021
Guys, take your spot,
wait for my "Go."

163
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,900
You guys ready?
For reward, survivors ready?

164
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:16,657
Go!
( cheering )

165
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:23,706
>> Come on, Ryan!
>> Come on, Ryan.

166
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:43,184
( cheering )
>> Come on, Ryan.

167
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:51,776
>> Come on, Ryan!
>> PROBST: Drake with an early

168
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,402
big lead.
>> Go! Go!

169
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:58,616
( all shouting )
>> Why doesn't he tag out?

170
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:20,971
>> Come on, Ryan!
>> Come on, Ryan!

171
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,307
( cheering )
Come on, Ryan!

172
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,267
>> PROBST: Ryan!
You can bring the item

173
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:35,069
back and tag out!
( yelling )

174
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,322
You got to take the goblet,
put it in the chest,

175
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,075
then get your item.
Ryno decides

176
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:47,623
to not take the mask.
Drake with two items,

177
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:53,587
Morgan still trying to get
their first one in the chest.

178
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:27,121
>> Go, Rupert!
>> PROBST: Drake with three

179
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,165
items.
Christa heading for the fourth.

180
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:41,010
Morgan with one.
>> Come on, Ryno!

181
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:48,350
>> PROBST: Christa with another
item for Drake.

182
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,352
>> Okay, I got it.
>> Yes, Chris, yes!

183
00:12:50,436 --> 00:13:01,363
>> All right! Let's go!
>> Come on, Morgan!

184
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,866
>> PROBST: Drake needs one more
item.

185
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,577
Burton, you're going to get
the bowl to put it in.

186
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,414
The bowl is your last item.
Ryno's worn out, passing off

187
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:20,508
the pearls to Lill.
>> PROBST: All seven, go get the

188
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:38,025
the pearls to Lill.
>> PROBST: All seven, go get the

189
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,071
chest.
Lock it up and bring it back.

190
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,240
Morgan's still working on
their third item.

191
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,076
>> That's it, Lill, come on.
>> All right, let's go get it.

192
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:57,044
Ready?
Three.

193
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:05,052
>> PROBST: Andrew is heading out
to get another item for Morgan.

194
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:15,104
>> One, two, go!
( grunting )

195
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:28,242
>> One, two, go!
( grunting )

196
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:33,080
>> Wait, wait, wait.
( yelling )

197
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,457
>> PROBST: Open it up.
Let's see your items.

198
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,795
You need all five.
Drake wins reward!

199
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,631
( cheering )
>> Whoo, baby!

200
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,634
( cheering )
>> One, two, three,

201
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,845
Drake!
>> PROBST: Drake, great

202
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,264
teamwork-- you guys worked
together, you had a great plan,

203
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,433
you didn't give up.
Here's the first clue

204
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,477
to your buried treasure chest.
You'll both head back to camp,

205
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,313
then Drake, you will decide
which member's going

206
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,316
to give Morgan a visit.
And you can help yourself

207
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,861
to one item from their camp.
( cheering )

208
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,363
>> ( chanting ): Drake! Drake!
Drake! Drake!

209
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:16,457
( chanting continues )
>> I'm guessing this

210
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:33,390
( chanting continues )
>> I'm guessing this

211
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,684
is a third of the map.
>> What's the back say?

212
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,519
>> "There's a treasure buried,
so be on your way.

213
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,855
Make sure you leave
at the right time of day.

214
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:41,857
You'll be heading east,
travel by land,

215
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,526
and don't plan to stop
when you run out of sand."

216
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,820
>> So, when they say,
"run out of sand,"

217
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,031
they're talking about right
there where it turns to rock.

218
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,824
>> It's really exciting
knowing that there's

219
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,409
treasure out there.
We're just...

220
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,662
our hands are tied right now
'cause it's high tide

221
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,997
and we can't do anything.
But as soon as it's low tide,

222
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,083
we're going to go out there
because who knows

223
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,585
what could be in there.
And I'm sure, whatever it is,

224
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,712
it could be beneficial.
>> We need to figure out who's

225
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,839
going to the camp to take
their stuff.

226
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,883
>> Well, I don't know if
anyone else is in agreeance,

227
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,260
but if I could think of
one thing we don't have...

228
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,221
We need a water jug
like the one that we ruined,

229
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,056
because if we could
fill that thing up...

230
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,557
>> Also something to keep
in mind, though, if...

231
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,685
if they have more
than one water jug

232
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,188
and if all they have is a tarp,
it would be good to hurt them

233
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,856
by taking their tarp.
>> Honestly, we don't

234
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,401
need to hurt them.
>> You can live by being wet.

235
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,945
>> We don't need to hurt them.
>> I'd let Sandra go.

236
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,863
Okay, cool.
>> Sandra, I'm for it.

237
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,699
>> Good.
>> No matter who goes,

238
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,743
if you're a nice person or not,
if you had another tribe member

239
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,705
come up to your camp
and take something of yours,

240
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,582
you wouldn't like them either.
I was happy that she went

241
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,127
rather than myself.
>> Pirate good, baby.

242
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,795
Pirate good.
>> Oh, my God!

243
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,965
I can't breathe.
( laughs )

244
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,313
>> They kicked our butts today.
And one of the reasons

245
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,442
it hurts so much
is because we did so miserably.

246
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,736
We are at a subsistence level
right now.

247
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,905
I mean, we're just getting by.
So, when some little punk from

248
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,575
Drake comes by here to take
one of our items, it doesn't

249
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,119
sound like a big deal.
But when you're living this,

250
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,621
it's huge.
>> What if the little

251
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,623
motormouth from Drake
says he wants our tarp?

252
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,670
>> Hell, no.
Are you-- oh.

253
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,798
There is no ifs, ands or buts
about it-- he takes that tarp,

254
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,842
I'm going home.
I'm not lying.

255
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:41,935
( laughing )
>> So, how y'all doing?

256
00:17:42,019 --> 00:18:05,501
( laughing )
>> So, how y'all doing?

257
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,337
Are you the ambassador
of the Morgan Tribe?

258
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,214
>> I'm the goober
of the Morgan Tribe.

259
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,882
>> Why do you say that?
I'm Sandra.

260
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,717
>> I'm Ryan.
Good job today.

261
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,677
>> You guys doing okay?
>> We're doing good.

262
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,679
How are you?
>> I'm Sandra.

263
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,807
>> Congratulations today.
>> Sander?

264
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,975
>> Sandra.
>> Sandra, Andrew.

265
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,019
>> Ryan.
>> Nice to meet you.

266
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,854
This is nice.
>> How does it compare

267
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,190
to your camp?
>> Ours is nice, too.

268
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,692
When I arrived at...
at the Morgan Tribe,

269
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,361
I could not believe
that they...

270
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,572
they just didn't have anything.
It's unbelievable.

271
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,157
I don't know how
they're getting through.

272
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,535
We managed to buy
a lot of stuff

273
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,995
at the village.
I mean, we bought tons

274
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,915
of stuff at the village.
So...

275
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,876
So, there's more stuff.
Where's the rest of it?

276
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,337
And so I looked around
and I went looking

277
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,633
for the water jug.
Where the ...

278
00:18:54,716 --> 00:19:00,180
is the water jug?
Well, they had no water jug.

279
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,891
So I said, "Wait a minute."
>> Did you make a decision yet?

280
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,228
>> Yeah.
I want that baby up there.

281
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,523
The tarp.
>> Okay, you're going to have

282
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,692
to take it down yourself, right?
>> Yep.

283
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,569
>> I have to take it
down myself?

284
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,237
>> Absolutely.
>> Okay.

285
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,573
>> Go ahead.
>> Damn, I didn't think

286
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:23,036
I'd come out here to work.
>> She's going to ruin it.

287
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,621
I'm going to lay it
nice and neat

288
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:31,503
so you guys can fix it back up.
I'll be done in a minute and

289
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,047
I'll be out of you guys's hair.
In order for me

290
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,966
to get the tarp,
I had to destroy

291
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,926
their whole shelter,
which I started feeling bad

292
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,928
until they started
running their mouths.

293
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,097
Can I use one of the knives?
>> No.

294
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,766
>> These are our knives.
>> I go to a grab a knife

295
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,102
and the black girl's like,
"No, no, no, no, no.

296
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,937
"You're not going
to use our knife

297
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,439
and you better not
cut our rope."

298
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,649
So I was like, "Okay.
Regardless...

299
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,110
I'm taking the tarp down."
>> Do what yoygot to do.

300
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,779
>> Not a problem.
>> Don't wreck the shelter,

301
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,032
okay?
>> No, no, no.

302
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,284
Hey, I got to do
what I got to do,

303
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,453
right?
>> No, not necessarily.

304
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,455
>> Wrapped around...
look, there we go.

305
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,626
It's not that bad.
It's all good.

306
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,836
But look, it's coming
apart fairly easy.

307
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,674
>> Sandra came over
and she was just...

308
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,594
I don't know.
That whole tribe is just...

309
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,512
is a bunch of ( bleep ).
I didn't do

310
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,099
any unnecessary harm.
You guys will have this up

311
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,477
in no time, I'm sure.
>> She acted like she was nice

312
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,271
about taking the tarp.
But I think she was a little bit

313
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,315
too snatchy about it
and tore it down

314
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,526
kind of on purpose.
>> You don't know how good you

315
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,821
have it until you see others.
Well, you guys sleep tight.

316
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,658
Don't let the bed bugs bite.
And, uh, no hard feelings

317
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,618
and I'll see you guys tomorrow,
okay? Take care.

318
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:51,458
>> Bye-bye.
She's such a bitch.

319
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:56,004
>> Andrew... it's getting dark.
>> I know.

320
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:01,843
>> Let's...
( thunder rumbling )

321
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,847
>> We all need to get
in the shelter.

322
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,860
>> But I'm going to help
with the shelter.

323
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,529
We're gonna get this
all done first.

324
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,197
>> We'll have time
to talk after that.

325
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,366
>> All right, we're going
to get this all done first.

326
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,535
>> Everyone was devastated
by the loss of our tarp

327
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,412
and Osten was
throwing in the towel.

328
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,539
He was finished.
He was ready to walk off.

329
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,166
We need people around
that are on the ups,

330
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,169
that are digging this game.
And this is great stuff.

331
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,879
We don't need people
just walking around,

332
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,549
"I don't... I want to go home,"
you know.

333
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:45,095
It's a real morale-killer
for the tribe.

334
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,389
>> Well, let's look at
the reality here.

335
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,392
There's so many things
and aspects to the game.

336
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,145
When it comes down
to it, it's mental.

337
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,564
>> I'm in here in shorts, and
it's gonna be raining and cold.

338
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,399
I'm gonna get sick,
and I could

339
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,192
potentially get pneumonia;
I've gotten it before.

340
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,028
I'm just not gonna...
I just don't feel

341
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,779
that-that I need that.
>> Yeah, but you're saying

342
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,322
you-you may be.
You don't know.

343
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,034
>> I will be at the end of
this, tonight.

344
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,369
>> Osten had mentioned to me
that he was potentially thinking

345
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,288
about quitting.
And I just wanted to talk

346
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,582
to him in a calm fashion
and truly understand

347
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,084
and then give him
my personal opinion.

348
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,587
My opinion is that
you're giving up.

349
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,757
You would be a loss,
not only for us,

350
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,596
but for me.
We're here in this together.

351
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,098
I'm just asking you
just to try, at least.

352
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,267
>> All right.
>> And that means

353
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,727
being here tonight
throughout the

354
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,438
whole night.
>> All right.

355
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:42,277
I'm gonna let that
marinate a little bit.

356
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,613
>> I think I'm done now.
I've made my peace;

357
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,491
I've said what I needed to say.
It's up to him,

358
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,118
what he wants to do.
Only he knows

359
00:22:50,202 --> 00:23:00,212
what's best for him.
>> It's impossible.

360
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:29,449
what's best for him.
>> It's impossible.

361
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,869
You can't even swim out there.
>> Really?

362
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,163
You see anything cool?
>> Went fishing,

363
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,125
to catch some fish, and I was
out there in the, um,

364
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,503
heavy tides and the currents.
Shot the spear, and, um,

365
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,755
the tip winded up coming off
and, um,

366
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,175
either got lodged under a rock
or is swirling around somewhere

367
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,928
in the tide.
But I just couldn't swim

368
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,389
anymore,
so I had to come back in

369
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,183
and break the news.
Yeah, we have a problem.

370
00:23:55,267 --> 00:24:04,651
>> What's wrong?
>> This. My spear is dead.

371
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,279
Where is the spear?
You didn't even get it?

372
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,865
It'll go to the bottom.
>> I looked all over.

373
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,992
The tide's so hard,
it keeps whipping me

374
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:16,037
back out to sea.
>> The current was so strong,

375
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,248
and it was throwing him
into the rocks, and...

376
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,250
Now, remember this is
in our little inlet

377
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,545
where it's a bathtub.
He couldn't find the spearhead.

378
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,755
He gives up.
That's why I wanted...

379
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,049
that's why I was...
>> I kept tightening it, too.

380
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,344
I wanted to be the
only one that did that.

381
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,430
You lost my bag and
you killed my spear.

382
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,056
>> And I didn't do it
on purpose.

383
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,766
>> I know. I know.
Can I be mad?

384
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,394
>> Yes, you can be mad.
But do you want to come

385
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,229
help me find it?
>> That is gonna ... us.

386
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,940
>> I know.
>> That right there

387
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,358
is gonna ... us.
>> I know.

388
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,903
Trust me, I know.
That's why I've been looking

389
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,489
for the last hour.
I had a little mishap, and

390
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,075
I lost the tip of the spear.
When I confronted Rupert,

391
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,411
he kind of freaked out a little
because he, you know,

392
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,247
he got attached to that as well.
That became his little thing,

393
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,583
you know, catching fish.
And I was pretty upset about it

394
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,084
because, you know,
I do care about

395
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,045
what others think, of course,
and I know how

396
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,047
certain people feel.
>> That is our meat.

397
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,299
That is our best meat source.
>> Well, can we just

398
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,426
make a pact, then,
not for Shawn to go

399
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,386
fishing with the spear?
>> Oh...!

400
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,556
>> No, I mean, I don't know
how to go spearfishing.

401
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,934
If you would try, you know,
like everyone else,

402
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,645
then, you know, it's a chance
you're gonna lose something.

403
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,439
I mean, you know?
It's try or not try.

404
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:28,109
>> Shawn is the biggest puss I
have ever met in my entire life.

405
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,987
>> But I say, as a tribe, we go
out there and try and find it.

406
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,281
>> Absolutely.
>> I mean, I don't mind

407
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,450
going back out by myself.
>> That is more...

408
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,453
That is as important to me
as that damn treasure chest.

409
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,914
My spear is gone,
the head is gone.

410
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:45,126
There's no more meat.
There's no more meat.

411
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:52,300
They're talking about
tying the damn fork off to it.

412
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,179
He could not even tell me
where he lost it at.

413
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:01,309
So I go out and I start
doing a grid pattern.

414
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:05,480
I start from the trees, start
from where I know he wasn't,

415
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,441
and on my grid pattern,
I'd do about a size

416
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,485
of a football field.
You're looking

417
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,529
at a general area
that's five or six

418
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:22,622
football fields.
>> Yes!

419
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:31,006
football fields.
>> Yes!

420
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,426
>> Where was it?
>> In the ocean!

421
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:38,179
>> Where in the ocean?
( laughing )

422
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:43,476
>> I am so happy.
Yes...!

423
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,356
Drake...!
I feel better.

424
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,192
I stopped yelling and screaming
at him and cussing at him

425
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,695
and calling him bad names.
Do they know we found it?

426
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,031
>> I think they heard you yell
and they assumed.

427
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,699
( laughing )
They assume you did,

428
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,536
but I had to come and confirm.
>> I know finding that spear

429
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,497
made him feel better.
If we hadn't have

430
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,875
found the spear,
he, for sure, would have been

431
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:21,181
done, done, done.
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

432
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,350
Welcome.
You guys doing all right?

433
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,893
>> Yep.
>> Great!

434
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,062
>> Doing good.
>> PROBST: First things first.

435
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,356
Let me ask about the looting--
who ended up going over

436
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,899
from Drake?
>> I went over.

437
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,401
>> PROBST: How'd it feel to be a
pirate?

438
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,321
>> It felt good to be a pirate.
>> PROBST: Just remember,

439
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,282
payback can be painful.
Okay, give me back

440
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:48,416
the Immunity Idol.
Immunity, back up for grabs.

441
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,710
Win immunity, your tribe is safe
from Tribal Council

442
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,588
for another three days.
For today's challenge,

443
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,423
three tribe members
from each tribe

444
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,134
will become prisoners
for the other tribe.

445
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,636
One person will have
their hands tied.

446
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,930
They will be on a raft
leaning against a pole.

447
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,307
The other two will be
draped across the raft--

448
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,227
their hands will be tied.
Using a rope-and-pulley system,

449
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,896
the other four members
from the opposing tribe

450
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,983
will pull as fast as they can,
taking you out to sea.

451
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,820
Meanwhile, the guy on the raft
is untying his hands

452
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,906
as quickly as he can.
Once he's untied himself,

453
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,450
he can then untie
the other two tribe members

454
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,578
who are draped across the raft.
When you're all three untied,

455
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,996
you swim
back to shore,

456
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,582
bringing with you
two ropes and the bamboo chute

457
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,419
which is tied to your raft.
Inside that bamboo chute

458
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,797
are compass points.
Go inside the compass ring.

459
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,133
You'll use the compass points
and your two ropes.

460
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,260
Where the ropes intersect
is a tribe flag.

461
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:44,180
Dig down, get it up
and get it in its sleeve.

462
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,141
The first tribe
to raise their tribe flag

463
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,477
and have all members with a hand
on the flag wins immunity.

464
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,480
Drake, you're sitting somebody
out-- esterday it was Sandra;

465
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,607
today it's Christa.
Everybody else strategize,

466
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:59,529
wait for my "go."
All right, the prisoners

467
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,532
for the Drake Tribe,
Rupert, Michelle and Trish,

468
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,659
will be pulled out to sea
by the Morgan Tribe.

469
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,661
Andrew, Ryno and Darrah,
you'll be pulled out

470
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:08,538
by the Drake Tribe--
immunity at stake.

471
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,874
Survivors ready?
>> Ready.

472
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:17,714
>> PROBST: Go!
>> Let's go, let's go.

473
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,676
>> PROBST: It's a race to see
who can get untied first

474
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:31,728
and back to shore.
>> PROBST: That a way to pull,

475
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:43,364
and back to shore.
>> PROBST: That a way to pull,

476
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:50,330
Morgan!
Andrew and Rupert

477
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,624
are both untied.
They're trying to untie

478
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,709
their teammates.
It's gonna be a race

479
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,253
back to shore.
Keep pulling.

480
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:06,387
>> Keep going, guys.
>> Here's mine.

481
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,890
>> PROBST: Andrew's got
everybody done-- he's going for

482
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,769
the bamboo chute.
>> Pull! Pull!

483
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,021
>> PROBST: Andrew trying to
untie the clue.

484
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:19,609
Rupert has his clue.
Both tribe members are free.

485
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:24,113
Morgan swimming in.
Bring your ropes.

486
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:31,079
Morgan swimming in.
>> Go!

487
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,082
>> Let's go!
You guys are doing it!

488
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,251
You guys are doing it!
Let's go!

489
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,213
>> PROBST: Morgan comes ashore
with a huge lead.

490
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,257
All right, give me
the coordinates.

491
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,301
>> PROBST: Go!
Start solving it.

492
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:51,099
Get in the ring.
>> Let's go!

493
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,142
Come on, run, run!
You guys got it!

494
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,812
Good job!
>> Nobody panic.

495
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,898
>> PROBST: Everybody's got
to get here first.

496
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,942
>> Come on!
>> Let's go!

497
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,236
>> PROBST: That a way, be
patient.

498
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,155
Morgan struggling to
get their coordinates open.

499
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,784
>> Get to your coordinates.
>> You got it.

500
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:14,289
Morgan still trying to get
their clue open.

501
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,124
Drake has their
first coordinate.

502
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,669
>> Down here.
Northwest to east.

503
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:23,840
>> Northwest south.
>> PROBST: Morgan finally has

504
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,466
their clue open.
Find the intersect!

505
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,428
Dig!
Start digging!

506
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,723
>> Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

507
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,273
>> PROBST: Don't quit.
Dig deep.

508
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,525
>> Let's go, guys.
Let's go!

509
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,819
>> PROBST: Drake has their flag
out.

510
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:50,658
>> Pick it up!
Come on, you guys!

511
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:58,166
>> Here we go!
>> Plug it in!

512
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,126
( cheering )
>> PROBST: Drake wins immunity!

513
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:04,172
>> Yeah!
( cheering, shouting )

514
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:09,302
>> Oh, yeah!
>> PROBST: Great effort.

515
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:14,015
Drake, once again,
immunity going back to camp.

516
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,518
( cheering )
>> Okay, guys, touch it.

517
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:23,149
Touch it.
>> PROBST: Next time I see you

518
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,818
guys will be at Tribal Council.
You can head back to camp.

519
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:35,870
See you in a while.
>> We lost immunity challenge

520
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:58,851
See you in a while.
>> We lost immunity challenge

521
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,980
today.
Tribal Council tonight.

522
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:07,694
Tribe's pretty devastated,
actually.

523
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,029
Of course,
the critical decision tonight

524
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,116
is who's going to go?
Who's leaving the Morgan Tribe?

525
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:23,209
( thunder rumbling )
>> At first,

526
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:32,218
( thunder rumbling )
>> At first,

527
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,554
when Osten told me that
he wanted to quit,

528
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,222
I was really shocked.
But then,

529
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,725
the more I thought about it,
the more it made sense.

530
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,310
This is a game where you've got
to have your whole heart

531
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,105
into this and it just doesn't
seem like he's got it.

532
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,442
It's only day six.
>> What's happening?

533
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,068
>> It's between
Skinny Ryan and me.

534
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:57,493
>> Huh?
If you're gone, we got no hope.

535
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,454
If you think
about Osten's strength,

536
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,290
his physical strength is huge.
We can't compete with,

537
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,626
you know, Grizzly Adams,
and those other two horses.

538
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,628
Without Osten?
It's impossible.

539
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,505
I mean, it's
clear over here.

540
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,466
The clouds are
going this way.

541
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,092
>> Enough's enough.
Feel like...

542
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,970
sleep out in the cold
just until I get pneumonia?

543
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,848
Just to win a million dollars?
And, if I don't win it,

544
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,934
then I got fluid in my lungs,
potentially, blood in my lungs.

545
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,312
It doesn't matter who you are.
You have no control

546
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,689
over your body.
If your body wants to make

547
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,442
you stop, you're stopping.
>> You know what?

548
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:33,821
Osten didn't win,
so he wants to quit.

549
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,657
How fair is that?
Osten's excuse was

550
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,744
his body was giving out.
I saw him on the beach.

551
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,455
He's running up and down,
throwing coconuts,

552
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,458
lifting logs, playing.
There's nothing wrong

553
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,960
with his body.
That's a piss-poor

554
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,838
attitude, isn't it?
>> Uh-huh.

555
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,508
>> He just got beat,
and he couldn't take being beat.

556
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,010
>> Did Osten come to you
and talk to you?

557
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,888
>> He came up to me and asked
me, face-to-face,

558
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,807
"Would you please vote
for me tonight?"

559
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,017
>> He told you that tonight?
>> Yeah.

560
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,311
Like, I'd say, less
than 30 minutes ago.

561
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,730
>> I was personally upset
and disappointed with Osten

562
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,899
for quitting.
I just can't understand.

563
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:14,487
I just can't fathom it.
>> You mean, vote myself off?

564
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,533
I thought about it, yeah,
but I don't know yet.

565
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,660
>> He has what it takes,
in my opinion.

566
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,538
That's what pisses me off.
It's because I care about him.

567
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,040
How can you cut yourself short?
You know, you got here.

568
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,376
When it comes down to it,
if that's the decision

569
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,295
that he makes, then it is
his heart that's not here.

570
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:35,800
And if that's the case,
he would have to go.

571
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,242
>> PROBST: Here we go again.
I know you guys don't

572
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,579
want to be back here.
So, Andrew, what are

573
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,291
the camp issues right now?
>> Still sleeping, Jeff.

574
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,042
The floor of our
shelter is still

575
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,086
not as comfortable
as it needs to be.

576
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,921
We had to rebuild
the whole roof because

577
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,631
Sandra from the Drake Tribe
came and, uh...

578
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,425
took our tarp,
which was our whole roof.

579
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,302
>> PROBST: But Sandra took
the tarp yesterday.

580
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,929
So what did you do for the
first five days? Ryan?

581
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,265
I mean, what's going on?
This is the second time

582
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,767
at Tribal Council
we've talked about sleep issues.

583
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,770
>> Uh, I... I think we're
kind of hurting in focus.

584
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,480
I don't think we've
ever actually sat down,

585
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,442
come up with an agenda, and
actually followed it through.

586
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,653
I think there needs to be more
teamwork, more unification.

587
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,323
>> PROBST: So Andrew, when...
when you look at this tribe,

588
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,950
they sort of appointed
you the leader.

589
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,453
You know, they sacrifice leaders
in some cultures that are as

590
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,997
decimated as this tribe is.
When is this going to change?

591
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,625
Because it isn't going
to get any easier out here.

592
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,627
>> Yeah, I know.
It's going to change tomorrow.

593
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,754
We're going to--
first thing in the morning--

594
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,465
finish the floor
to where we get a solid sleep.

595
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,800
No more sleep deprivation,
hallucinations,

596
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,636
mentally shutting down--
all that stuff.

597
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,180
And we're just going
to take care of it tomorrow.

598
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,641
Enough is enough.
>> PROBST: Lill, as

599
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:11,687
a lifelong scoutmaster,
assess this tribe.

600
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,357
If this was your
pack of Boy Scouts,

601
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,318
how do they rank?
I would give them an A+

602
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,363
for spirit.
You have to understand,

603
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:23,324
the last two challenges, we were
this close to winning.

604
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,660
I don't think,
if the spirit's not there...

605
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,371
>> PROBST: Whoa. Wait a second.
The reward challenge, you guys

606
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,375
would still be out there.
So you weren't close to winning.

607
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,461
Assess the tribe.
You guys, you aren't sleeping,

608
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,547
you've lost every
challenge so far.

609
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,508
Give me some truth here
about the tribe.

610
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,510
There's a problem somewhere.
Where is it,

611
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,513
from your point of view?
>> The only thing that I think

612
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,724
that we ought to be doing
is maybe fishing a little more.

613
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:53,187
>> PROBST: That's all you see?
Anybody here want

614
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,690
to own up to the fact
that they're a little...

615
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,900
they're a little on edge about
being out here?

616
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,819
>> Listen, I ain't going
to lie to you.

617
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,529
Normally, under
normal circumstances,

618
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,198
I would not be here.
Absolutely not.

619
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,867
>> PROBST: So, once<i> Survivor</i> is
over, however long

620
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,870
you last, you won't anytime soon
be going on another trek?

621
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,375
>> Absolutely not.
No. No doubt about it.

622
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,377
>> PROBST: Again, you have
to vote somebody

623
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,879
out tonight.
It's a big vote.

624
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,382
You can't continue
to lose tribe members.

625
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,428
So, Lill, what do you base
the vote on tonight?

626
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:30,016
I would base my vote on who has,
uh... contributed

627
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:35,271
to the troop--
I'm sorry-- to the tribe,

628
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,898
whether or not
they have accepted

629
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,444
defeat, or did they just
give up and say,

630
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:45,239
"This isn't for me."
That would be what my...

631
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:47,199
my vote would be for.
>> PROBST: Andrew, how

632
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,868
about for you?
It's tough.

633
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,578
What's your vote going
to be based on?

634
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,205
>> I look for the weakest link.
And I... I don't

635
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,207
care if you're 100 pounds.
I don't care

636
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,376
if you're 250 pounds.
Who's bringing the tribe down?

637
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,587
Who's not laying it all
on the line

638
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,548
and willing to just go crazy
to get it done

639
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,092
to further the tribe.
That's my analysis, and that's

640
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,094
how I'm voting tonight.
>> PROBST: Ryan, how

641
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,472
about for you?
>> Uh... normally, I would go

642
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,807
for, uh... whatever
the weakest person, uh...

643
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,060
physically.
But, uh... a person

644
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,229
came up to me today and, uh...
told me that they...

645
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,273
they were ready to go,
so that's probably

646
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,650
what I'm going to base mine on.
>> PROBST: So somebody came to

647
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,819
you today and said they're ready
to go, meaning they want

648
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,780
out of the game?
>> Right.

649
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,823
You going to tell me
who that is?

650
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,784
>> Of course not.
>> PROBST: We'll see how it

651
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,786
plays out.
It is time to vote.

652
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:41,837
Andrew, you're first.
>> Osten, I think you're great,

653
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:52,932
Andrew, you're first.
>> Osten, I think you're great,

654
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,143
but you gave up on us.
You're the one

655
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:01,982
who's saying, "My big burly body
has shut down."

656
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,693
I don't believe
it was because of your body.

657
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:14,787
So I'm voting for you tonight.
>> Ryan, you're a great kid.

658
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:20,626
So I'm voting for you tonight.
>> Ryan, you're a great kid.

659
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,670
You got a bunch of heart.
You just don't have

660
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,797
the strength for this game,
and I'll see you

661
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:34,849
when I'm out of here.
>> You would have never

662
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:42,356
when I'm out of here.
>> You would have never

663
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:46,110
gotten this vote if you hadn't
asked me to.

664
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,786
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

665
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,175
>> PROBST: Once the votes are
read, the decision is final.

666
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,386
The person voted out
will be asked to leave

667
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,680
the Tribal Council
area immediately.

668
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:22,062
I'll read the votes.
First vote:

669
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:34,074
Osten.
Skinny Ryan.

670
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,244
Osten.
Two votes Osten.

671
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:41,749
One vote Ryan.
Ryan.

672
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:48,756
That's two votes Ryan,
two votes Osten.

673
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:54,220
Three votes Ryan,
two votes Osten.

674
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,389
The second member voted out
of the Morgan Tribe,

675
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,266
Skinny Ryan.
That's four votes.

676
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,769
That's enough.
Last vote will remain a mystery.

677
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:12,780
You need to bring me your torch.
Ryan, the tribe has spoken.

678
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:22,873
It's time for you to go.
>> PROBST: You can head back to

679
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:32,633
It's time for you to go.
>> PROBST: You can head back to

680
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:42,726
camp-- good night.
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

681
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:52,278
camp-- good night.
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

682
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:59,076
from our next episode.
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

683
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,161
>> Osten? He quit.
>> There's a big difference

684
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,330
between quitting
and pulling the trigger.

685
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,624
>> PROBST: At Drake, the hunt is
on.

686
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,502
>> I want to find that treasure
so bad.

687
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:10,212
>> PROBST: And there's trouble
in paradise.

688
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,006
>> You know what?
I can get loud, too!

689
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,841
What the...?!
I can get loud, too!

690
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,759
>> I don't want to...
argue with you!

691
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:22,683
>> Screw Jon. He's an ass.
>> I think I lost

692
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,144
this game in the, uh...
first five minutes

693
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,354
I was out here,
'cause I didn't make friends

694
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,315
with the right people.
It was really hard

695
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,858
turning things around.
I wish I would

696
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,027
have just gone and just tried to
be friends with everybody.

697
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,737
I'm upset that the
ride's already over.

698
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,530
This is a game I
know inside and out.

699
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,490
I would have to say that I'm
kind of disappointed in myself

700
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,910
and I'm not sure I gave it 100%.
Sorry if I let anybody down.
