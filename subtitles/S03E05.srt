00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,878
(Jeff Probst)
Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,922
The young were in control
at Samburu,

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,757
with a four-to-three
member advantage over the old.

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,217
Survivors, ready! Go!

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,846
Boran won
the immunity challenge.

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,889
- Woo!

7
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,933
- Before Tribal Council
the young members of Samburu

8
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,561
proposed a plan that would
protect them in case of a tie

9
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,105
vote after the merge.

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,275
- None of us have one vote
against us, except for Lindsey.

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,276
- I never thought I'd say,

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,404
"vote for me"
three times tonight, come on.

13
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,239
But it will help us, as long as
I don't get voted for once

14
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,075
the merger happens.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,786
- And what's in it for us?
- Nothing.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,121
- At Tribal Council,
the older members did not go

17
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,415
along with the plan.

18
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,417
- Instead, they gave
all their votes to Silas,

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,879
making him more vulnerable
in future Tribal Councils.

20
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,131
But the young members gave
their four votes to Linda,

21
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,340
and she was
voted out of the tribe.

22
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,135
Linda, the tribe has spoken.

23
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,095
12 are left.

24
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,097
Who will be voted out tonight?

25
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,932
♪♪

26
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,057
- They could have done
the strategy part with us.

27
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,100
- What was your and Frank's
strategy in that?

28
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:22,934
- I understand that.

29
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,853
- Frank, I know you
want to get far,

30
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,229
and I know T. wants to get far,
but what was your all's
logic in that?

31
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,438
I mean, it's just
a simple question.

32
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,942
I honestly don't care,
I just want to know.

33
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,943
Explain your logic
in the voting, that's all.

34
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,903
- I know. But I'm just saying
you misread me,

35
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,905
if it helps you out at all,
that's all.

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,408
- You were punishing us
because we wouldn't tell you.

37
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,743
- The three of us had no idea
who was leaving.

38
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,412
- So what?
- No idea.

39
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,746
- So we stayed together.

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,416
We kept our alliance
because we had no idea...

41
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,543
- No, this is what happened
Lindsey--

42
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,587
- They're punishing us.
- No, no, no. Just hold on...

43
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,505
- What you guys
told all of us was,

44
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,258
"We want you guys
to all vote for Lindsey,

45
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,261
but we're not going to tell you
what we're going to do...

46
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,721
...but this is what
you guys got to do."

47
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,264
Now we're, you know...

48
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,391
we're the low men
on the totem pole, so...

49
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,059
- Okay, so it was revenge.

50
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,563
That's okay, T.,
that's all we needed to hear.

51
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,647
If you guys would use
the power over us to say,

52
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,482
"You do this for us..."

53
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,734
- You wanted to use the power
over to screw us for the game.

54
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,776
I understand that.

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,028
- Don't be emotional tonight,
Silas,

56
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,112
because we're all
really high-strung.

57
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,239
It's easier to talk about it
tomorrow

58
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,282
when we're not emotional.

59
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,658
I totally understand, T.

60
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,493
If I had been put in that spot,
I would have said,

61
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,287
"Screw my chances,
screw them all,

62
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,622
let me just take them out..."

63
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,082
- No, you would not have
screwed your chances.

64
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,292
- No, but I'm trying to make
things easy and nice,

65
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,168
so that we can
get through tonight...

66
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:30,752
- I wouldn't have
screwed my chances.

67
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,629
- That's okay, though.

68
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,006
It's so funny, though,
T-bird, it's like, you know,

69
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,467
you all talked about character
and loyalty and honesty

70
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,676
and all this stuff,

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,637
and it just proved right
now that, you know,

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,306
you guys just...
are full of crap.

73
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,983
- Uh, Tribal Council, and, uh,
we had to go in there

74
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,318
and eliminate somebody,
and, of course,

75
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,152
it was going to be one

76
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,112
of the three elders
of the tribe,

77
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,156
uh, myself or Teresa or Linda.

78
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,158
Unfortunately, it was Linda.

79
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:05,703
But, uh, that's the way it was
going to happen, we knew that.

80
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,497
Uh, we are still
a tribe divided.

81
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,290
We're two tribes in one.

82
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,459
Um, the youth,
they think they can do it alone.

83
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,460
They need us, and, uh,

84
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,672
they basically just ignored us
and cut us off.

85
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,507
Keep isolating us, we're going
to keep fighting, you know?

86
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,885
I haven't seen an invitation
come across the board, so...

87
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,473
- Hey, it's a game,
which they utter every minute,

88
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,391
"It's a game. It's a game."

89
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,643
I don't know.

90
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,520
I felt so good last night.

91
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,898
I feel so good right now,
because I know we got to them

92
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,150
and it feels good.

93
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,415
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah,
they definitely set up mine,

94
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:55,294
up Silas, and A.K.A.

95
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,171
They weren't here to play
the game last night, you know.

96
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,215
They were there for revenge
for them to show,

97
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,258
"Ah, kiss my ass," you know.

98
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,217
"We have the power.

99
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,011
Look at this,
we're going to screw you."

100
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,221
And, you know, again, it just
shows the older group's maturity

101
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:08,391
level, and, again, it's a game
and, you know, no big deal.

102
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,227
- I'm not used to
all these emotional people.

103
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,439
This is a game and, you know,
we're supposed to be thinking.

104
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,732
Whether they believe it or not,

105
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,026
we have to have
those two people.

106
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,111
I mean, we have to win one more
immunity challenge,

107
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,529
or it doesn't matter what we do
or how many votes we have.

108
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,740
We're all screwed.

109
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,200
It's very frustrating for me
to see a clear picture and have

110
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,455
these people around me just,
like, living in the moment
and not having any--

111
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,542
Like, not caring at all that
the things they say are really--

112
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,087
have huge consequences on what
happens two days from now.

113
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,599
- All right, buddy. You're up.

114
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,435
- All right.

115
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,480
All right,
we have a little voodoo doll.

116
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,939
- Whoo.

117
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,274
- Okay, guys.

118
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,943
We got mail and it's probably
the strangest mail

119
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,527
we've ever gotten.

120
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,488
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

121
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,741
- Everyone has to put on
their thinking hat.

122
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,576
"Pick three from your tribe
to go on a quest.

123
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:13,456
You get to decide who you feel
would be the best."

124
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,502
- "Vote or draw straws
and send them on their way.

125
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:22,465
The other three wait,
but for what, we won't say."

126
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,800
- Wow.

127
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,302
- Simple as that--
it's a quest.

128
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,804
They only want three people.

129
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,430
- Definitely you.

130
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,809
- You know what, T-bird,
you sat out the last one.

131
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,811
Why don't you go on
this one for sure?

132
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,645
- Yeah, it sounds good to me.

133
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,649
Who else wants to go?

134
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,483
- It's show time.

135
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,568
- Good luck, guys.

136
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,320
- Do some housecleaning.

137
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,447
- All right.

138
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,615
- Who do you think we ought
to go with?

139
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,076
- I think, uh...

140
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,619
Lex, uh, Tom and... Kelly.

141
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,914
- One, two, three.

142
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,416

Boran!

143
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,510
- Welcome to Day 13
of<i> Survivor.</i>

144
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,513
We brought you back to this
original drop point,

145

where it all began,

146
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,725
for what I think is going to be
a pretty interesting day.

147
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,853
As you guys have certainly
figure out by now,

148
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,313
the game of<i> Survivor</i>
is always changing,

149
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,857
and it's about to change again.

150
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,153
If you guys
could give me your buffs?

151
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:25,528
Lex?

you guys are now members

157
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:47,091
- Kelly, Lex, Tom, you guys
are now members of Samburu.

158
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,885
- Smokes.

159

- Here's a map, Frank,
to your new home.

160
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,141
- Thank you, sir.

161

- Kelly, here's a map
to your new home.

162
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,811
Samburu, your guys
are heading this way.

Boran, you're heading that way.

Head on out, guys.

166
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,907
- We're part of Sam-boohoo now.

167
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,074
- What's the name, man?

- We're part of Sam-boohoo now.

- How many times did I say,
"I'm glad I'm not on that team"?

- Yeah, well, now you are.

"Give me your buff."

I almost turned around
and bolted.

00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,213
If he... you know, and ran.

174
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,506
It's a long way back to camp,
but if he'd give me the option--

175
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,718
run all the way back to camp,
no water for two days,

176
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:35,514
or give me your buff,
I'd still be trying to run.

177
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,728
- I'm going to try to intervene
and get as much gossip as I can.

178
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,898
- "Big ears" Kelly will get it.

179
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,774
- Yeah, we can use this as
a good way to find out all sorts

180
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,109
of information on their team.

181
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,112
And it's really crucial for us
to figure out which one of them

182
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,281
has votes against them.

183
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,576
- I see somebody, guys.

184
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,827
- Oh, my God, I think that
the other team is coming here.

185
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,790
- We've got a little bad news
for y'all.

186
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,460
- No. What?
- We have bad news.

187
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,295
- When they arrived,
I was excited at first.

188
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,589
I was like, "Oh, sweet,
other team members are here.

189
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,548
What's going on?"

190
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,134
- We're now Samburu.
- You are kidding me?

191
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,427
- Oh, my God.

192
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,221
- No one's more shocked
than we were.

193
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,764
- Hi.
- Hi.

194
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,640
- What the heck?!
- Are you serious?

195
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,017
- Yeah.

196
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,646
- Then as reality set in,
we all kind of just panicked.

197
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,315
- Is this a joke?
- No.

198
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,692
- No, it's not for real?
- No. It is.

199
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,320
- Not for, like, good.
- Yeah, until the merger.

200
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,322
- Where's all your stuff?
- It's on the way.

201
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,490
- No way.
- No way.

202
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,325
- Yeah.

203
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,827
- So welcome! Come here!

204
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,828
- Oh, my God, are you kidding?

205
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,497
- Something is up, though.

206
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,000
- That's people from their
tribe coming to us.

207
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,251
- It is?

208
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,794
- When I saw them coming up,
I thought they were going to try

209
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:51,048
to, like, steal our flag
or get some info from us

210
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:51,841
or check on our house.

211
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:56,345
- Clarence, Ethan, Jim!

212
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,141
- We're switching homes?
- I'm Boran. Silas.

213
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,643
- Yeah? Holy...

214
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,729
It was a switch.

215
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,814
They're, like,
"We're on your side now,"

216
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,024
and my stomach dropped,

217
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,359
because everything
I had worked for,

218
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,028
all the bonds I had made,

219
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,406
two closest friends
on the team were now gone.

220
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,575
And I was, like, "I'm going
to have to start over."

221
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,661
Oh, man. Nice.
You guys have a roof on yours?

222
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,038
- Yeah.
- You built a roof?

223
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:22,830
- Yeah.
- Is it nice?

224
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,749
- We built a roof and we put...

225
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,209
in the day in the heat,
we put blankets over it

226
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,545
and put blankets down for shade.

227
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:32,548
This is all our... you know,
the creek water here.

228
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:35,384
My old tribe,
I had an alliance

229
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,844
with four
of the young people.

230
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,596
Now as far as the situation,
you know, yeah,

231
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,472
it's not that great.

232
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,890
I mean, I came here with
the two people

233
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,391
that I didn't probably
want to come here with,

234
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,476
and you know,
left three of my buddies

235
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,728
back at the other camp,
and that was kind of tough.

236
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,896
I mean, we're just...

237
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,191
our minds right now
are going crazy.

238
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,407
- Is that what they're
looking for?

239
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,368
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely gorgeous.

240
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,535
Careful-- we're trying not to
let the rice drop because

241
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,578
if it expands in their...

242
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,579
- We have really good food.

243
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,872
You know, the water's kind
of like mud here,

244
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,248
but the food's really good.

245
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,083
So there's kind of a trade-off.

246
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,251
- So what do you guys
do all day?

247
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:09,919
Do you lounge around like we do?

248
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,296
- There's a lot of lounging.

249
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,299
- All of us-- and I'm sure the
old Samburu felt the same way--

250
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,762
all of us had been so careful
about arranging our strategies

251
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:25,726
and arranging for our own
security and well-being...

252
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,894
that, all of a sudden,

253
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,063
all of that was completely
blown asunder.

254
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,190
How's the firewood?
Do you guys have a lot of wood?

255
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:31,899
- No.
- No.

256
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,942
- Are you guys struggling, too?

257
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,611
- We have tons stored up,
though.

258
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,946
- You should see how much
we stored up.

259
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,780
We stored up enough
for the next week.

260
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,865
- I'm so pissed off.

261
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,242
- You think you're on top
one minute,

262
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,952
and then we just had
this incredible loop thrown

263
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,330
towards us, and, you know...

264
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,000
just this kink in the loop
that just threw everything off,

265
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,754
all confidence completely
down the drain.

266
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,091
- This is amazing, y'all.

267
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,259
- You know, I don't mind

268
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,135
playing the cards
they've dealt me,

269
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,971
and I'm taking it like
a little man.

270
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,848
I put a smile
on my face this morning,

271
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,016
but I had to move it
a little bit.

272
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,977
- Whoa.

273
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,770
- Oh, it's all coming out
the back.

274
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,147
- Oh, gosh, watch it.

275
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,982
- Okay, we should have made
a bigger depression in there.

276
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,068
- We were, we were pissed about
the fact that when we got there,

277
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,820
it looked like a bunch of
lazy people

278
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,488
had been running the camp.

279
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,824
You know, can you lift it up,
so I can just dig a pit for it?

280
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,992
There was a mound of ash,
you know,

281
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,327
a foot-and-a-half high.

282
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,997
They hadn't really been taking
care of their fire properly.

283
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,332
There was almost
no firewood inside the camp.

284
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,626
And one of my first questions
was, you know,

285
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,711
"Where's all the firewood?"

286
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,296
And so you're all more than
welcome to look around.

287
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,505
There's the firewood--

288
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,174
we've pretty much yanked
all the firewood.

289
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,843
- We can all do a firewood run
after we go to the water hole.

290
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,013
- Yeah, but, I mean,
there's just not much around.

291
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,693
- We've all... we've worked
really hard and suffered a lot

292
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,528
with no food and no water
and stuff like that,

293
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,322
and just to see
people out here who just...

294
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,033
don't take it seriously
and be stuck with them,

295
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,201
it's painful.

296
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,661
- Did you find the map?
- I didn't look.

297
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,999
- We kind of made a little path
with rocks.

298
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,835
It's really mushy.

299
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,086
If you step in the wrong spot,
you'll sink.

300
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,882
- Now go left.
- Oh, left?

301
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,759
- Yeah, now go left.

302
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,010
- And then straight?

303
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,261
Do we go over the dry riverbed?

304
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,137
- No, go along it.

305
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,096
- There's a path right there.
- Oh.

306
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,432
- Go north.
- Okay.

307
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,934
It was obvious that these people
were napping all day,

308
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,229
and that
they weren't doing squat.

309
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,274
This is mud.

310
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,946
- They've been drinking out
of a mud hole, like hell.

311
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,156
- Hi.
- Hello.

312
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,407
- Yeah, it's pretty harsh, huh?

313
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,868
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is sick.

314
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,703
Oh, my God,
it's even dirtier today.

315
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,789
- It's really bad.
- We've been clearing it out.

316
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,749
- Yuck!
- ...clean my feet.

317
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,125
- Do you guys
do laundry in this?

318
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,044
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

319
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:57,920
They keep waiting for
a mysterious thing

320
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,921
to happen here in Africa--

321
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,507
wood's gonna fall
out of the sky,

322
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,927
there's going to be an artesian
well coming up in the camp.

323
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,929
I don't know,
maybe a swimming pool.

324
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,764
But I don't think
that's going to happen,

325
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,934
and I feel like we're going
to have to get out there

326
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,144
and pull the plow.

327
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:18,899
♪♪

328
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,699
- You want small stuff.

329
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,076
- All this stuff burns,
like, a madman.

330
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,078
- I'm definitely on
the other side right now.

331
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,956
I was on the good side,
now I'm on the bad side.

332
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,793
This twist in the game has
really stuck a thorn in my side.

333
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,169
- I wanted this.
I wanted you on my team anyway.

334
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,297
- I know,
that's what I said, man.

335
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,591
- I said, "If you, like,
give me him, we'll be straight."

336
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,134
- Do you think this is a cool
thing to have happened?

337
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,012
- Frank and I thought,
"Are we going down this way?"

338
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,013
- Right.

339
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,139
- Just because the four,
you know...

340
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,141
- Obviously, either you
or Frank was next.

341
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,517
- Right.
- Yeah.

342
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,311
- Frank and T, this has just
rejuvenated their life.

343
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,314
- I mean, this is like a whole
new opportunity for them,
you know,

344
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,148
because they knew at least
one of them was going

345
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,734
to go the next vote.

346
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,320
- All this happening today,
Frank and I looked at each other

347
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,654
and thought, you know...

348
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,324
- We're alive again.

349
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,159
(elephants trumpet)

350
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,661
- There's, like, nine of them.

351
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,746
- They're there.

352
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,289
- Oh, yeah, I see them right
through here, actually,

353
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,457
right there.

354
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,666
- I don't see the babies.

355
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,793
- I see this large one coming
up behind this one, as well.

356
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,796
- It's nice... there's a
trumpeting of the elephant.

357
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,299
Magnificent creature this close.

358
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,383
Unbelievable.

359
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,886
(low rumbling)

360
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,897
- Even in the face of defeat,
we're not going down.

361
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,439
You never give up,
absolutely not,

362
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,273
right till the end.

363
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,193
Not till I'm six feet
underground.

364
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,444
- So they were asking you guys
to vote with them,

365
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,528
but they wouldn't tell you
which one of you

366
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,572
they were going to vote off?
- Right.

367
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,034
That's how bad it was,
you know, it was just...

368
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,535
And when they tried
to tell Teresa

369
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,206
to vote for Lindsey
because they wanted Lindsey

370
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,207
to keep all the strikes
against her...

371
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,583
- Who said to vote for Lindsey?

372
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,877
Those same people
told to you vote for...

373
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,754
- All four of them.
- They wanted to keep...

374
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,215
So the other three
wouldn't get any,

375
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,050
because they were an alliance,
they weren't going to break up,

376
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,678
so as long as they had
the control...

377
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,097
- It's even better
they told Linda and Teresa, "

378
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,018
Now, you guys vote like that
and we'll drag you along."

379
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,895
- So both times you guys went
to Tribal Council, it was,

380
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,772
like, all out war.

381
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,732
- And I told you never give up,
right, girl?

382
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,860
- You did.
- Not till the end.

383
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,303
- This is now Samburu tribe.

384
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,596
I'm not on the Samburu tribe.

385
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,764
The red is a red herring.

386
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,099
It's a false front.

387
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,893
I'm still on Boran
and so is Lex and so is Tom.

388
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,938
- We've been herding
a castrated bull

389
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,440
is what we've been herding.

390
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,817
And there... we've got a queer
and two girls as tight

391
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,318
as a banger hide.

392
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,279
And I don't think we can
get rid of Brandon.

393
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,615
I think we're gonna have to try
to go for Lindsey.

394
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,950
She's a whiner.

395
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,785
But, hell,
they're out here doing...

396
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,288
We've inherited a camp
that ain't done nothing.

397
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,458
- I think Brandon's got

398
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,251
at least a vote against him,
though.

399
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,961
- You think that?
- Uh-huh.

400
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,464
I think Frank--
I think Frank voted for him.

401
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,675
Hey, you guys didn't do
three hours, did you?

402
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,885
- I tried.

403
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,928
I thought we were out there
for at least two-and-a-half.

404
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:40,934
- Let's don't get caught
huddled up.

405
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,936
- I hate this game.

406
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,899
One vote against me,
and I'm out.

407
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,108
It's not even a question.

408
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,193
I guarantee you,

409
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,487
none of these people have
four votes against them.

410
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,362
- We have to anticipate going
to Tribal Council

411
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,283
because we're out-manned
so drastically.

412
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,951
If this challenge
is in any way physical,

413
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,953
I don't see the point
in playing.

414
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,121
We will lose.

415
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,040
- But I think
we will lose today.

416
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,042
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

417
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,210
- Why?

418
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,004
- Because they have Silas
and Clarence and Ethan.

419
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,047
- Oh, man.

420
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,967
- The good part about it is,
that me, Lex and Tom

421
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,010
have no votes against us.

422
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,678
- Good morning.
- How are you?

423
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,349
- So no matter who they pick,
we should be okay as long as

424
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,018
we pick the one of them
that has votes against them.

425
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,355
Tom and I and Lex have all sort
of whispered a little bit.

426
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,940
They talk too loud, though, too.

427
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,858
You've got to watch because
of the eavesdropping, of course,

428
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,901
goes both ways.

429
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,985
(birds screeching)

430
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,695
Whoa, birds, God.

431
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,324
But, um,
we all like Brandon the best...

432
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,534
Well, I mean, that's not true.

433
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,660
I like Kim a lot, too,

434
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,662
but Kim is just so much more
of a physical threat.

435
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,206
And then Lindsey, everyone
thinks is really annoying.

436
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,499
Aw...

437
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,377
- Oh, well, it'll be all right.

438
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,255
- I got me a tick on my ass.

439
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,178
- It's no big deal,
it's just broke.

440
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,055
This is going to be hot,
all right?

441
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,098
- You gonna scald me?

442
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,685
- You want to check your finger?

443
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,229
- I can do it.
- Put it right here.

444
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,275
- I think he's just gonna pop
right off when I get him.

445
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,359
(groans)

446
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,402
- Hold still..

447
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,572
- Okay, that's hot,
that's really hot.

448
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,365
- Lindsey had a tick
on her butt,

449
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,575
and tell you the truth,

450
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,410
when a woman had trouble
on her butt,

451
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,912
I told her that's just
what I was made for.

452
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,914
(groaning)

453
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,083
- Ow!

454
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,294
- It was one of nicest jobs
I've had to do here so far.

455
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:35,424
- Oh, God.
- Okay, let me check him.

456
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:40,429
- Looks like he's...

457
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,308
See, he's already moving,
he's not happy.

458
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,601
Is that all right?

459
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,227
- Son of a...

460
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,186
- I think pretty soon,

461
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,355
we can pull him, he's just going
to come out.

462
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,985
All right.
- Did you get him?

463
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,570
- I got him
and I got his head, too.

464
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,572
You did?

465
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,282
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

466
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,283
- Thank you.

467
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,452
- I think it was good for her
and good for me.

468
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,287
It was kind of
a refreshing reward.

469
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,715
(goats bleating)

470
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,390
- Getting my first look

471
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,310
at the reformed Samburu
and Boran tribes.

472
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,981
Not near as much talking today
as there has been in others.

473
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,191
All right.

474
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,360
Let's get to today's
reward challenge.

475
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,653
For a lot of the people,

476
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,488
indigenous people here
in East Africa,

477
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,491
goat herding,
it's a way of life.

478
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,992
A pretty simple challenge.

479
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,160
Got 40 goats in there,

480
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,162
they've been marked,
20 with Samburu colors,

481
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,830
20 with Boran colors.

482
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,999
The first tribe to get
their 20 goats

483
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,252
into their own pen at
the finish line wins the reward.

484
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,089
Here are the rules:
one gate-keeper from each tribe,

485
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,340
that person will
stay in your pen and

486
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,509
they're responsible
for getting your goats in

487
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,469
and keeping the other tribe's
goats out.

488
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,515
Here's what you're playing for:
A nice little home here--

489
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,977
three egg-laying chickens,
one rooster.

490
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,187
For the winning tribe,
certainly a big decision.

491
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,564
You can either use these guys
for their eggs

492
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,149
and have fresh food every day.

493
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,485
On the other hand, you may
attract predators at night.

494
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,778
I'll give you a couple
of minutes

495
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,988
to pick your gatekeeper,
we'll go.

496
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,540
All right, guys,
here we go.

497
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,000
Survivors, ready?

498
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:33,542
Go!

499
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,712
(bleating)

500
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,462
(bells clanking)

501
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,012
(yelling)

502
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:54,563
(whistling)

503
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:58,108
(yelling)

504
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,578
(whistling)

505
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,459
(yelling)

506
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,503
(whistling)

507
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:24,468
(bleating)

508
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,636
(yelling)

509
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,656
That's one, Boran.

510
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,117
Boran, that's two.

511
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,202
That's three.

512
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,802
Boran, you're at four.

513
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,221
Boran at five.

514
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,271
Boran, that's six.

515
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,773
Samburu, that's one.

516
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,483
Boran at seven.

517
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,569
Samburu, you got seven.

518
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,613
Boran, you're at eight.

519
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:31,326
Boran, you're at nine.

520
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,286
Come on, baby, come on!

521
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,498
That's ten for Boran.

522
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,499
That's 11, Boran.

523
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:45,215
Nine, Samburu.

524
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,093
What have you got, Teresa?

525
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,017
Samburu, you got 14.

526
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:56,685
16, Boran.

527
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,146
Seventeen.

528
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,647
Boran's got 17.

529
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,650
That's 18.

530
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,696
- Open up!
Open up!

531
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,495
- Nineteen.

532
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,918
That's 17, Samburu.

533
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,672
18, Samburu.

534
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,215
20, Boran wins.

535
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,259
- Whoa! Yeah!

536
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,471
(cheering)

537
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,476
- Chickens and plenty of feed.

538
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,769
You guys got
to carry these home.

539
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,731
- If we can carry those goats,
we can carry those chickens.

540
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,899
- Yeah, nice job,
congratulations.

541
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,193
- Thank you.

542
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,446
- Sorry, baby.

543
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,432
Frank is in seventh heaven,
killing a chicken tonight.

544
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,684
- I know it.
- Yep.

545
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,769
- Oh, well.

546
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,771
We'll beat them next time.

547
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,273
- Yep.

548
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,358
- Whoo!

549
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,693
- Seeing our old tribe mates
now being against us

550
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,987
was kind of
weird in the beginning.

551
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,615
You know, it was definitely
annoying to see Silas and Frank

552
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,952
were really, like,
blocking us

553
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,453
from getting into
the little corals.

554
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,956
It was frustrating just because
it's, like, Silas, you know,

555
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,999
it's somebody we were
working together with

556
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,085
and now he's working
against you,

557
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:45,961
so it was
very frustrating.

558
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,797
(sniffling)

559
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,841
- This sucks so bad.
- I know.

560
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,635
(sniffles)

561
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,596
- Silas, too.

562
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,306
- It's just, it's how it is,

563
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,474
I mean, there's nothing
we can do.

564
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:00,433
It's luck.

565
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,018
We didn't know
this was going to happen.

566
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,022
- Can't vote for me.

567
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,565
(sniffles)

568
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,442
There's no stability out here.

569
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,113
It's just, like, walking on
egg shells every second, and...

570
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,322
it just gets frustrating.

571
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:19,327
It's really draining, I mean,
we're hungry, we're tired,

572
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,455
you know, we just had
this new team appear

573
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,999
and we're all stressed out,

574
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,001
and I'm just emotional
over it all.

575
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,503
You know, I've made
these great new friends,

576
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,422
and I'm so excited to leave
with this experience

577
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,506
because it's awesome,

578
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,342
but I'm not ready to leave yet
and I'm terrified.

579
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,510
I don't want to go.

580
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,845
- I don't care.

581
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,471
Right now, all I'm going to tell
all of you is we are winning

582
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,889
immunity if there is a challenge
tomorrow and there is

583
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,141
no doubt about it.

584
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,685
- She just doesn't think about
strategy at all.

585
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,562
She just runs her mouth
and she's, like, right now

586
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,188
she's just running scared
they're going to vote for her.

587
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,233
And she doesn't care that we're
trying so extra hard, Kim and I,

588
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,027
to keep that from happening.

589
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,362
- You guys, I almost cried
when I saw Silas

590
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,322
and then after the challenge,

591
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,448
I wanted to punch him out.

592
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,825
- I will find a way to get them
to vote for me tomorrow,

593
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,827
as long as you all just...
we have to stick...

594
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,537
- Do you want to read that book
again tonight?

595
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,497
You can't let one of them watch
while you're reading the book.

596
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,623
- Yeah, I'll watch first watch.
Who cares?

597
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,334
I'll just say, you guys,
"Can I do first watch tonight?"

598
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,168
and you say,
"Yeah, I'll do it with you,"

599
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,878
and let's just leave it at that.

600
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,880
- When you are, like,
doing everything,

601
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,923
everything for your team, like,

602
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,885
you've got two girls
that are trying, like,

603
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,927
their damnedest to save
their own ass,

604
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,388
because they want you
to get the vote, yeah,

605
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,598
they'll vote with you.

606
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,432
They'll back you up
and they'll vote for

607
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,892
whoever you tell them
to vote for,

608
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,393
but you have to
tell them who to vote for.

609
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,436
You have to tell them
what to do.

610
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,395
You have to tell them, look,

611
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,230
"You don't need to be
so nice today, Kim.

612
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,607
You need to be
a little bit bitchy,

613
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,067
so that they'll have
another choice besides Lindsey,

614
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,568
because we're both screwed
if do you that."

615
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,611
When you have to think of
everything,

616
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,739
and then all they do
is cry and whine and moan

617
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,240
and bitch and complain
all the time,

618
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,367
I'm just like...

619
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,369
It's such a great thing
that I'm gay

620
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,745
because I could not stand to
put up with a crying woman now.

621
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,081
I couldn't do it.

622
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,382
- So from your team,
Lindsey has four votes?

623
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,549
Or she has more than that?

624
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,302
- She, uh, has four.

625
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,804
- Then me and her,
if it came down to it,

626
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,681
we'd be tied.

627
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,974
- I see what you mean because...

628
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,976
- They'll try and hit me.

629
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,770
All the immunity challenges
are huge to us.

630
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,773
This one coming up is just a
stepping-stone to the next one,

631
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,274
especially for Silas and I.

632
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,026
We have bull's-eyes on us,
no doubt,

633
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,612
so we got to make the most
out of having both of us

634
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,905
on the same tribe.

635
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,783
Take a big lead and then pick
off the others one by one.

636
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,952
- (whispering) If we start
telling him to vote for Silas,

637
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,078
I don't trust him.

638
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,663
I think he might go to Silas

639
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,081
and tell him because he's trying
to be buddies with Silas.

640
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,459
Ethan thinks up over him because
he thinks he has, you know...

641
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,461
- He won't come to one of you
guys and say,

642
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,797
"Let's get off the big guy?"

643
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,966
- No. He thinks they're making
some bond together.

644
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,634
He's very foolish that way.

645
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:42,303
I mean, he really believes that
the two of them can go into it

646
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,474
and win the thing,
the two of them together, so...

647
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,143
- Oh, I just figured he'd go
with him, so...

648
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,018
- I don't think
he'll vote for Silas.

649
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,854
- Okay.

650
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,355
♪♪

651
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,984
- I've talked with Kim,
I'm like,

652
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,278
"Kim, this may sound crazy

653
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,487
and I've never done this
in my life,

654
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,656
I'm an athlete,
I go out to win,

655
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,241
I've never fixed anything."

656
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,868
I'm like,
"What would you think if we lost

657
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,995
this next challenge
on purpose?"

658
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,831
It's going to be very tough
for me not to win this.

659
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,000
I mean, I'll be honest with you

660
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,170
because I've never done that
in my life.

661
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,255
- Only two more immunity
challenges before the merger.

662
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,341
I talked with Kim
and also with Ethan...

663
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,803
that if we didn't win this one,
that was okay.

664
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,514
- Immunity challenge is
a win-win situation.

665
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,016
We win the challenge, great--

666
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,477
we don't have
to go to Tribal Council.

667
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,521
We lose, we end up going
to Tribal Council

668
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,692
and I get to vote off, you know,
my biggest threat.

669
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,902
- We all ready?

670
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,614
(exhales)

671
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,542
- Take it back.

672
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,586
Immunity is back up for grabs.

673
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,172
Today's immunity challenge
is very simple,

674
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,381
as simple as it gets.

675
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,675
Behind you guys are 20 pieces
to a puzzle.

676
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,052
The first tribe to put
the puzzle back together

677
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,597
correctly wins.

678
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,184
One key element: you must
work together as a tribe.

679
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,686
You don't have team work,
you will lose.

680
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,397
For the winners, at least
three more days in Africa,

681
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,899
one step closer to the merge.

682
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,067
For the losers,
another visit to Tribal Council,

683
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,152
another member
voted out of your tribe.

684
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,071
I'll give you guys
a couple of minutes

685
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,280
to figure out your strategy.

686
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,242
Wait for my go.

687
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,077
- Tall guys grab
the higher pieces.

688
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,911
- You are the center man.

689
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,955
You tell us what
to get

690
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,248
and we'll grab it and we'll
bring it back.

691
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,332
- Immunity at stake.

692
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,083
Survivors ready?

693
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,669
Go!

694
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,434
- Kelly, where does this go?

695
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,562
- Just put it down.
We're getting to these first.

696
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,401
- Make it happen.

697
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,486
- Put that in there.

698
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,154
- Here, give me...

699
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,450
- We can go here.
We can go here.

700
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,829
One can go there.

701
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,830
Okay, this goes right here.

702
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,123
Move these.

703
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:15,999
- Does this go up top?
Does this go with the head?

704
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,125
This is the head. Come on.

705
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,961
In the front, the very front.

706
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,381
- This right here, this goes
here.

707
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,841
- Where am I going?
Where am I going?

708
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,802
- In that corner, in that
corner, by the man.

709
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:29,971
All right, pull this, Kim,
pull this.

710
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,139
It's in.
Push it in.

711
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,808
- Look at the color schemes.

712
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,268
Look at the colors.

713
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,645
Look at the colors.
Look at the colors.

714
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,354
Move that.

715
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,023
To the front, the very front.

716
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,940
Move, move, move.

717
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,150
Right here, come on.

718
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,652
No, no, no.

719
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,194
We need a sharp point.

720
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,155
Right there, Ethan.

721
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,156
Does that fit?

722
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,198
No, that doesn't fit.

723
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,033
- It goes down here!

724
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,826
- Right there, right there.

725
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:52,619
- Like this!

726
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,661
Right there!

727
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,874
Go right up there.

728
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,667
Right in there.

729
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,586
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

730
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,795
Is this it?

731
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,172
No, that's not it.

732
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,681
- Hey... get up, get up!

733
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,849
The eye, right there...

734
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,684
Right there!

735
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,521
Right there!

736
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,481
- That's it, that's it.

737
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,024
Let's go. Come on, let's go!

738
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,902
I need a point here.
I need a point here.

739
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,364
- Here, talk to me, talk to me.

740
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,241
- Right here!
Right here!

741
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,869
- Where does this go?!
- Over here!

742
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,871
Hurry!
- This is it.

743
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,247
Move, move, move.

744
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:43,378
That's it, let's go,
let's go.

745
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,380
- Put it in, put it in!

746
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,590
Yes! Yes!

747
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:51,844
(cheering)
- They could have it wrong!

748
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,929
Move, move.

749
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,889
That goes there.

750
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:58,685
- Samburu.

751
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,727
It's over, Boran.

752
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,103
- Right here, right here.

753
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,106
That's it.

754
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,233
- Yeah!

755
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,861
- Good job, baby.

756
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:17,036
- Samburu, immunity.

757
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,748
- Yes!

758
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,750
- We got it.

759
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,294
- You know what's
coming next, right?

760
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,754
Tribal Council, tonight.

761
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,756
You're going
to lose another member.

762
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,300
- Don't worry about it.
Good work.

763
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,867
- Me and Silas had it out,
over in the bushes.

764
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,243
He's like, "Ethan, let's go get
some wood."

765
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,121
I'm like, okay, we're going to
have a meeting.

766
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,831
- Let me tell you this, Frank
stabbed everybody in my tribe in

767
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,332
the back.

768
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,251
He would have been gone a long
time ago, but we needed

769
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,586
a strength.

770
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,796
- Meanwhile, in my head I'm,
like, I like Frank.

771
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,632
- I don't know, just God...

772
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,638
He's the most manipulative of
them all.

773
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,641
And I'm like, well, I see
Clarence as a threat to me

774
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,143
come the merger.

775
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,270
- I don't see Frank as a threat
to me at all.

776
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,938
- I don't either.

777
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,356
- I have a tough time with
Clarence, and that's what it

778
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,525
comes down to and I don't want
him here anymore.

779
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,985
It's as simple as that.

780
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,612
I haven't wanted him here since
day three.

781
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,363
- I mean... T and Frank,
I think I can get them to,

782
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,240
you know...

783
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,325
- Vote for Clarence?

784
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,494
- Mm-hmm.

785
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,501
- Ethan and Kim, they've had
their problems, I guess,

786
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,668
with Clarence.

787
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,171
They'd like to see him out,
so I don't think he's got

788
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,881
the cards in his hand
on this one.

789
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:55,676
This one's
going to slip through.

790
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,263
- (Kim)
Clarence's past experiences
have been relayed to Teresa,

791
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,683
Silas and Frank, the fact that
Clarence ate seventh-eighths of

792
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,393
the can of food, and that he had
no permission to do it.

793
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,855
And I think there have been
rumblings with the new tribe

794
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,484
members that we've had some
issues of trust with Clarence.

795
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,196
Silas makes Ethan very
nervous, and I think that he has

796
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:19,200
very strong connections in his
other tribe.

797
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,120
Are you in an alliance at all?

798
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,791
- Well, with the three that
were left behind.

799
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,376
It's, like,
Ethan and Lex and Tom.

800
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,046
More than anything, I want to
get to the merger.

801
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:33,214
- So you are in alliance
with the three others?

802
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,674
- No,
when I say alliance...

803
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,259
It was just personality-wise.
There was no alliance.

804
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,678
- No, well, I'm glad you told
me because I didn't realize that

805
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,847
you were so tight with, like,
three other ones that were

806
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,431
already there, and so that's
sort of why it's important you

807
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,183
get to the merger, maybe, too.

808
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,226
- I mean, I came to win,
obviously.

809
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,352
- Right, right.

810
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,563
- I mean, there's only...

811
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,064
- Right.

812
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,941
He may be a real nice guy in
real life.

813
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,402
In our tribe,
I don't buy his schmooziness.

814
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:59,782
- I mean, hey, look at me
right now.

815
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,119
Let's go get some firewood.

816
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,080
I went to get wood with Ethan
and just kind of wanted to pick

817
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:08,291
his brain, and he said he wanted
to get rid of Clarence, and I

818
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,252
think he has some ill feelings
towards Clarence and I know Kim

819
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,922
does too, and, hopefully, those
are strong enough to convince T

820
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,424
and Frank, and vote for him and
then he'll go off.

821
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,718
What did you talk to Clarence
about?

822
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,303
- I told Clarence because I saw
you talking to Kim.

823
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,221
I'm like, Clarence, I think
there's a plot against me.

824
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,764
- See, Ethan, this is my logic.

825
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,391
I think you're all against me,
now.

826
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,311
Come on, man, look me
in the eye.

827
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,438
- I'll look you in the eye.

828
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,441
This morning, I thought we
agreed on Clarence.

829
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,735
- Frank and T are going
to probably vote for me.

830
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,986
- I thought they were with you.

831
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,237
You said they were
with you this morning.

832
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,906
You were going to get their
votes.

833
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,115
- Well, which one
do you want to take?

834
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,117
- That's what I'm saying.
- Well, let's decide, damn it.

835
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,994
- I thought you were, I thought
you were 100%...

836
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,997
(both talking at once)
...something about T and Frank

837
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,498
getting Clarence.

838
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,167
I thought we were going to be
five against one.

839
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,294
- You, me and Clarence are
going to vote for Frank.

840
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,545
I don't think Kim wants to
vote for Frank.

841
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,298
Who does she want to vote
for?

842
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,215
- Clarence, if anyone.

843
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,009
- I'm dying to see what's going
to happen.

844
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,303
It's tough, but I definitely
know it's going to be probably

845
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,304
myself or Clarence.

846
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,766
It's going to be a good Tribal
Council tonight.

847
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,787
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Jeff.

848
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,498
- It's been a busy
three days.

849
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,667
- Yeah.

850
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,002
- Ethan, what was your
reaction when these three new

851
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,338
guys show up at your camp?

852
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,425
- Well, our first reaction was
they're coming to, you know,

853
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:46,305
steal our flag or, you know,
steal something from our tribe.

854
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,184
So we were very skeptical and
paranoid, I guess could you say.

855
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,895
But then we saw they had our
buffs on, and they're like,

856
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,021
"Listen, we're part of you now."

857
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,524
And it was absolute shock.

858
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,025
I didn't know what to think.

859
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,361
You know, my stomach dropped,
and I was just like...

860
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,363
"Oh, my God."

861
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,616
- The thing that was hard, it
seemed because we had agonized

862
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,994
over who was going to go, who
was going to stay and we had all

863
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,663
kinds of reasons why the people
that were going should go.

864
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,374
And then when we actually saw
what had happened, you still

865
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,544
weren't sure if you had made the
right decision to go or to stay.

866
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,921
It was, like, you didn't know

867
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,047
if it was a good thing
or a bad thing.

868
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,009
- Silas, spending three
days with this new tribe, do you

869
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,219
feel now that you guys are one
tribe together, or are there

870
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,470
still two tribal lines in there?

871
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,016
- Well, Jeff, as soon as you
switched the buffs on us

872
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,768
and gave us the new colors,
obviously it was a new game.

873
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:37,565
So I think when we're all
wearing yellow buffs,

874
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,191
we're a team.

875
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,444
And I think that Samburu, the
same thing, they're wearing red

876
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,446
and they're a team.

877
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,615
- Frank, would you say
your lot was improved or

878
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,869
weakened by this swap?

879
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,580
- Personally, improved, most
definitely.

880
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,915
Camp conditions-- excellent.

881
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,376
Good open line of communication.

882
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,253
Very mature people--
respect, a two-way street.

883
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:01,088
Seem to have their priorities
very well set,

884
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,882
their securities high.

885
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,759
I really like it.

886
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,219
- Clarence, one of the
new things for you is another

887
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,554
young alpha male coming
in here,

888
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,932
does that
lessen the need for you?

889
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,269
- No, actually, Silas coming in
actually, you know, helps.

890
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,438
I think that we're stronger
together, you know, and I think

891
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,566
everyone here realizes that
we're stronger together.

892
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,568
Obviously,
we saw that with the goats.

893
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,780
You know, I picked up two goats
and it certainly helped,

894
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,075
you know, having my new tag team
partner, now that Tom's gone,

895
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,201
having him pick up two goats.

896
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,287
So, you know, having him here is
definitely going to be

897
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,622
a benefit, more so than
a hindrance, for me.

898
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,083
- Okay, guys,
time to vote.

899
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,001
Silas, you're first.

900
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,385
- I love you, man, but I can't
trust you.

901
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,560
- I'll go tally the votes.

902
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,873
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

903
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,666
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area

904
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:01,917
immediately.

905
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,751
I'll read the votes.

906
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,800
First vote...

907
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,178
Silas.

908
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,019
Silas.

909
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,697
Silas.

910
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,830
The fourth and deciding vote,
Silas.

911
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,208
No need to read the other two.

912
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,585
You need to bring me your
torch, Silas.

913
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,472
Silas, the tribe has spoken.

914
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,810
It's time for you to go.

915
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,947
Well, there's been a lot of
assumptions made by you guys

916
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,114
so far in this game.

917
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,035
One of them is that, in three
days, there'll be a merge.

918
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,707
You can head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.

919
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,814
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

920
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,653
- (Jeff)
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

921
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,697
With the merge in question,
Boran faces a crisis.

922
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,284
- If there's no merger after
three days, we have no food.

923
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,326
- (Jeff)
At Samburu...

924
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,662
- Strategy is becoming more
critical than ever,

925
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,789
more than it
was even a couple days ago.

926
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,000
- (Jeff)
Brandon and Kim continue
to help Lindsey hide

927
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,335
her votes
from their new tribe mates.

928
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,795
- They just assume that I
have a vote.

929
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,046
- It's a whole
different ball game.

930
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,678
- The twist of the game
was amazing.

931
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,515
I kind of had my cards lined up
the way I wanted them going into

932
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,851
the merge, because I was with
the two people that were

933
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,311
about to kick off.

934
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,854
You know, I just couldn't
recover from it.

935
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,648
I was a threat to Ethan
and the rest of the group.

936
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,858
It's tough to be sitting here.

937
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,818
I, you know, I planned
on winning the whole thing.

938
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:33,861
I'd play the game tomorrow.
I'd play it next year.

939
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,904
I mean, it's unreal.
