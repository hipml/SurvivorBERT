ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN AN ADVENTURE
THAT WILL FOREVER CHANGE THEIR

00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,460
LIVES.

4
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,296
YOU LOOK AT ME, YOU THINK
THIS IS SOME NEW YORKER.

5
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,531
HES A MILITARY GUY.

6
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,466
BUT IM CURRENTLY IN LAW SCHOOL.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,602
AND DEFINITELY DONT WANT
ANYBODY TO KNOW IM GOING TO BE

8
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,738
A LAWYER BECAUSE THE WRONG FIRST
IMPRESSION COULD MAKE OR BREAK

9
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,540
MY ENTIRE GAME.

10
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:45,211

ALONGSIDE FOUR RETURNING

PLAYERS: DAVID, AUBRY,
WENTWORTH, AND JOE.

15
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:05,432
THEIR VAST "SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE
COULD MAKE THEM A DESIRED ALLY

16
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,801
OR AN EASY EARLY VOTE.

17
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,703
I THINK THAT IM GOING TO
HAVE A TARGET ON MY BACK, BUT

18
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:15,208
IM GOING TO TRY MY HARDEST TO
NEVER SHINE BRIGHTER THAN

19
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,242

GAME-CHANGING TWIST.

00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:34,928
GO HOME OR GO TO THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION, WHERE THEYLL BE

23
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,598
PUSHED FURTHER THAN EVER BEFORE
FOR A CHANCE TO GET BACK IN THE

00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,799

25
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,368

31
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,001
THATS HOW FAST THIS GAME MOVES.

32
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,670
AND EVERY SEASON IT GETS A
LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED, A

33
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,072
LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO WIN.

34
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:24,410
NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE, YOU
ARE ALWAYS HOVERING ON THE EDGE

35
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,979
OF BEING VOTED OUT.

36
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:30,917
JUST THINK OF THE HISTORY OF
GREAT "SURVIVOR" PLAYERS WHO

37
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,185
HAVE YET TO WIN.

38
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:36,322
IN FACT, LETS JUST INVITE FOUR
OF THEM TO JOIN YOU THIS SEASON.

BRING THEM IN!</i>

OH, MY GOD, THAT KELLEY
WENTWORTH?

42
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:53,740
MY TWO FAVORITES PLAYERS ARE
KELLEY WENTWORTH AND MY TOTAL

43
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,908
"SURVIVOR" CRUSH IS JOE.

44
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,677
AND SO WE SEE THIS BOAT COMING
AND THEN YOU SEE THE BLOND.

45
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,213
AND IM LIKE THATS FREAKING
KELLEY WENTWORTH.

46
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:05,685
AND IT GETS CLOSER AND IM LIKE,
"IS THAT JOE, TOO?"

47
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,220
OH, MY GOD.

48
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,755
DAVID.

49
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,756
AUBRY.

50
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,858
I HATE THAT YOU BROUGHT
PEOPLE I LIKE.

51
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,059
Jeff: COME ON UP.

52
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:19,165
THIS IS WHO YOURE GOING TO BE
PLAYING WITH: WENTWORTH, DAVI

53
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,566
DAVID,.

55
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,501
MAN BUN!

56
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,502
Jeff: JOE.

57
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,537
AND AUBRY.

58
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,139
OH, MY GOD.

59
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,341
WELCOME BACK.

60
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,644
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LETS
REVIEW THE TRACK RECORD OF THESE

61
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,513
FOUR RETURNING PLAYERS.

62
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,849
KELLEY WENTWORTH-- FIRST WOMAN
TO FIND TWO HIDDEN IMMUNITY

63
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,620
IDOLS, AND WHEN SHE FOUND
HERSELF IN A DEEP HOLE, SHE USED

64
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:45,725
ONE OF THEM FOR A RECORD-SETTING
BLINDSIDE.

65
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,894
DAVID WRITING-- SCARED OF PRETTY
MUCH EVERYTHING--

66
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,530
YOU DONT NEED TO RELIVE ALL
THAT.

67
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,132
Jeff: ON DAY ONE, BUT HE
DIDNT GIVE UP ON HIMSELF.

68
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,036
AND HE TURNED INTO A DOMINANT
STRATEGIC FORCE.

69
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,173
JOE HAS PLAYED MOST OF HIS
"SURVIVOR" DAYS WITH A MASSIVE

70
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:03,142
TARGET ON HIS BACK.

71
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:07,447
DESPITE THAT TARGET, JOES
TRIBES HAVE WON 16 CHALLENGES.

72
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,784
AND AUBRY, LITERALLY CRIED IN
THE SHELTER.

73
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,420
<i>( LAUGHTER )
THE FIRST TIME SHE PLAYED, BUT</i>

74
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:20,560
SHE OVERCAME HER INSECURITIES
AND LASTED 76 OUT OF THE

75
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,329
POSSIBLE 78 DAYS SHE PLAYED.

76
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,399
FOUR VERY DIFFERENT STYLES OF
PLAY, FOUR VERY GOOD PLAYERS.

77
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,601
NONE OF THEM WON.

78
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,504
BECAUSE "SURVIVOR" IS
UNPREDICTABLE.

79
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,640
AND THATS WHY ITS SO GREAT.

80
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,042
AND THATS WHY YOU ARE HERE.

81
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,344
YOU CHOSE THIS ADVENTURE.

82
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:42,448
AND WHEN "SURVIVOR" PUSHES YOU
FURTHER THAN YOU EVER IMAGINED,

83
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:47,020
THAT IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO
STAND UP, ADAPT, AND CONQUER.

84
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:51,057
AND THAT IS THE THEME WERE
GOING TO BE EXPLORING THIS

85
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,891
SEASON.

86
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,260
THIS IS "SURVIVOR: EDGE OF
EXTINCTION."

SOME OFFER LONG-TERM HELP.

99
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,362
SOME ARE PERISHABLE.

100

YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TO GET
ANYTHING OFF OF THIS BOAT INTO

101
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,533

Jeff: THEYRE EVERYWHERE
RIGHT NOW, ALL OVER THE PLACE,

00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,771
VERY LITTLE COMMUNICATION,
EVERYBODY JUST GRABBING WHATEVER

00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,006
THEY CAN AND TRY TO GET
OVERBOARD.

115

OPEN WATER.

121
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,691
NATURALLY ME, WHO CANT SWIM,
WILL COST ME TO BE THE FIRST ONE

122
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:37,430
GONE, IN THIS GAME, IF YOURE ON
THE OUTS, YOURE OUT.

OH, MY GOSH!

140
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,146

WELL, LETS GO LOOK AT OUR
CAMP.

00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:37,557
AS EVERYONES INTRODUCING
THEMSELVES, IM SO OVERWHELMED

146
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,691
BY THE FACT THAT IM IN THIS
GAME.

147
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:42,195
IM STILL SO EXCITED BECAUSE IM
A HUGE FAN OF THE SHOW.

148
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,664
IVE WATCHED IT SINCE THE VERY
FIRST EPISODE.

149
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,098
IM A MORNING NEWS ANCHOR.

150
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,499
ARE YOU REALLY?

151
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,333
YEAH.

AND GET THIS-- IN THE 115th
WERE 130.

153
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,806
SO PRETTY GOOD.

154
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,210
NO ONE THINKS NEWS ANCHORS
ARE TOUGH.

155
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:01,814
IVE GOT DAD BOD OUT HERE BUT I
HAVE A LOT OF BELIEF IN MYSELF.

156
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,785
I WANT TO BREAK THROUGH THE
WALL-- OH, YEAH!

157
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,855
APPRECIATE IT.

158
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:09,956
OH, MY GOD!

159
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,723
ARE YOU OKAY?

160
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:11,824
IM FINE.

161
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,860
JUST EXTREMELY CLUMSY.

162
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,894
YOULL SEE THIS SEVERAL TIMES.

163
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,696
SO MUCH FOOD.

164
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,597
ITS CRAZY.

165
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,733
WHAT IS HE DOING?

166
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,869
I DONT TRUST ANYONE.

167
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,973
PLAYING A THIRD TIME, I KNOW
I MAY HAVE A TARGET ON MY BACK

168
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,775
INITIALLY, SO GETTING AN INITIAL
ALLIANCE IN THE BEGINNING IS

169
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,343
VERY IMPORTANT.

170
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,244
HOW ARE YOU?

171
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,146
IM GOOD, HOW ARE YOU!

172
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,881
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

173
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,848
GOOD.

174
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,017
I PLAYED FROM THE BOTTOM IN
"SECOND CHANCE."

175
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,218
THATS NOT A GOOD FEELING.

176
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,787
SO THIS TIME I WANT TO HAVE
GENUINE RELATIONSHIPS WHICH CAN

177
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,490
BE HARD FOR ME BECAUSE IM A
CLOSED OFF PERSON.

178
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,559
I PLAYED SOCCER IN COLLEGE.

179
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,862
I PLAYED SOCCER IN HOLLY, NOT
COLLEGE, BUT ITS AMAZING.

180
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:50,930
I HAVE TO BE MORE OPEN.

181
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,999
I HAVE TO GET TO KNOW THESE
PEOPLE ON A HUMAN LEVEL.

182
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,835
SO WHO KNOWS WHAT THEYRE
DOING?

183
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,472
WE WERE GOG ASK DAVID,
BECAUSE, IDEALLY, WE WANT TO

184
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,439
HAVE TWO TREES, KIND OF.

185
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,875
WERE WAITING ON YOUR
EXPERTISE HERE,.

186
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:03,943
OH, REALLY?

187
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,412
THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED
"SURVIVOR," I WAS AFRAID TO,

188
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,613
LIKE, VOICE AN OPINION.

189
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,550
CHOPPING THE WOOD, LIKE THE
SOUND OF THAT, LIKE, RATTLED ME.

190
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,019
I HAD TO PLUG MY EARS WITH MY
FINGERS.

191
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,355
AND ITS, LIKE, I WAS WORRIED
THAT MY TRIBEMATES WERE GOING TO

192
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,590
HAVE THAT PERCEPTION OF ME.

193
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:21,093
THIS TIME, PEOPLE ARE COMING TO
ME, THESE NEWBIES WITH LIKE,

194
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,161
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

195
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,897
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?"
AND IM LIKE, IM TRYING TO GIVE

196
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,032
THEM IDEAS.

197
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,634
WHICH WAY WERE YOU THINKING,
GOING IN THIS DIRECTION?

198
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,937
SEEMS LIKE, YEAH, RIGHT.

199
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,141
I WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL I CAN HELP
THEM NAVIGATE, ESPECIALLY THE

200
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,010
VERY EARLY PART OF THIS GAME SO
THAT THEY KNOW IM A FRIEND.

201
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,879
YOU CAN TRUST ME, KEEP ME
AROUND.

202
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,380
SO YOU OPEN UP THIS LITTLE
GUY HERE.

203
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,181
OKAY.

204
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,017
AND THEN ITS JUST OVER AND
UNDER.

205
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:51,357
SO YOU GO UNDER, THEN OVER.

206
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,925
DO YOU DO THAT ALL THE TIME?

207
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,027
I HAVE MILD TURRETS.

208
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,463
DOES THAT MEAN IF YOU CURSE
ONE OF US OUT.

209
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:05,071
SO, LIKE THE POPULAR VERSION
OF TOWERETS IS LIKE A... THING

210
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:05,938
LIKE THAT.

211
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,907
I DONT HAVE THE VOCALIZED
VERSION OF IT.

212
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,046
I HAVE MOTOR TICKS-- I HAVE
VOCAL TIPS.

213
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,651
I HAVE TOURETTES WITH A TOUCH
OF O.C.D.

214
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,587
A TOUCH OF CO-CO-COMBO.

215
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,392
IF I DO AND THIS DO THIS AND
THIS ARM ONE, ITS A WHOLE BUNCH

216
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:26,993
MIXED IN.

217
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,127
IT HAS TO BE ALL OF THEM.

218
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,162
AND I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW
THEYRE KIND OF GOOD.

219
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,499
BUT IF I GET REALLY EXCITED OR I
GET REALLY CONCENTRATED INTO

220
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,936
SOMETHING OR FITALK ABOUT THEM,
THEY ACT UP A LOT.

221
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,340
YEAH SO ONE OF THEM IS THAT
LITTLE BIRD NOISE.

222
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,675
WOW, THATS IMPRESSIVE.

223
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,345
IM KIND OF LIKE AN OPEN BOOK
IN A WAY.

224
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:52,785
IM NOT GOING TO BE, "HEY,EN, I
HAVE TOURETTES."

225
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,389
ITS SOMETHING I FEEL
COMFORTABLE ABOUT.

226
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,326
I TRY TO HAVE A GOOD SOCIAL GAME
BUT LETS ADMIT IT, IM AWKWARD.

227
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,996
IM NOT GOOD AT-- PEOPLE-- HOW
WOULD I SAY IT?

228
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,966
LIKE, THEY VIBE IN A WAY THEY
COULD NEVER.

229
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,102
BUT I HAVE TOND THAT THIS IS A
GAME, AND YOU HAVE TO PLAY BY

230
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,673
THE RULES OF THE GAME.

231
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:23,349
I GUESS I HAVE TO PLAY BALL!

232
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,483
<i> </i>

233
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,483
(

234
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,483
<i>CHEERS )</i>

235
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,486
IVE BEEN DREAMING OF THIS
MOMENT SINCE I WAS A KID.

236
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,890
WHEN I WAS, LIKE EIGHT YEARS OLD
I ASK SANTA CLAUS FOR A

237
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:31,691
"SURVIVOR" BUFF.

238
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,659
SO IM JUST DYING TO GET IT
STARTED.

239
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,394
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CHOP
THAT?

240
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,028
PIECE BY PIECE.

241
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,363
WERE COUNTING ON YOU.

242
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,166
COMING INTO THIS GAME, IM
REALLY TRYING TO PUT "JOEY

243
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,201
AMAZING" AWAY.

244
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,271
IM A BETTER VISUAL LEARNER.

245
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,739
YOURE A VISUAL LEARNER.

246
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,842
ITS HARD, BECAUSE NEW PLAYERS
ARE ASKING YOU, "HEY, WHAT

247
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,777
SHOULD I DO?"
SLAM, 45.

248
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:55,347
AND YOU DONT WANT TO POINT
YOURSELF OUT AS A THREAT, YET,

249
00:11:55,381 --> 00:12:00,186
YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER THESE
NEW PLAYERS, SO WHAT DO YOU DO.

250
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,054
YOU GOT IT.

251
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,923
OH, YEAH.

252
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,624
YOU SMELL THAT?

253
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:12,364
IT SMELLS LIKE SUCCESS.

254
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,234
AAAHHHH!

255
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,469
FIRE!

256
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,905
HAVING JOE ON OUR TEAM MEANS
IM BETTER SET FOR THIS GAME.

257
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,140
I DONT HAVE TO MAKE FIRE.

258
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:21,841
JOE DID THAT.

259
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,876
I DONT HAVE TO MAKE A SHELTER.

260
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,610
JOE DID THAT.

261
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,878
HES JUST AMAZING.

262
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,613
AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH
HIM IN THIS GAME.

263
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,915
IM GAY AND IM STILL ON "TEAM
JOE."

264
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:30,516
WHAT NEXT?

265
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,284
KEEP IT ALIVE.

266
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,887
DONT LET IT DIE.

267
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,288
IM GETTING NOWHERE.

268
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,657
IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS HARD.

269
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,392
( LAUGHS )
IM DONE!

270
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,560
IM DONE!

271
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,597
IM TRYING TO HELP OUT AROUND
CAMP AS MUCH AS I CAN, BUT I

272
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,564
LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY.

273
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:50,870
I HAVE NO OUTDOOR SURVIVAL
SKILLS WHATSOEVER.

274
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,437
OW!

275
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:51,904
OH!

276
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,205
I HAVE A SPLINTER!

277
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,141
BUT IT HURTS.

278
00:12:55,174 --> 00:13:00,412
I THINK THE CLOSEST THAT I CAN
COME TO IS THAT I PEED IN BUSHES

279
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,314
OF CENTRAL PARK ONCE, AND THAT
WAS AN EMERGENCY.

280
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,416
SO THIS IS DEFINITELY GOING TO
BE A TEST FOR ME.

281
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,651
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT.

282
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,220
BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO BE
THE PERSON THAT EVERYBODY LOOKS

283
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,590
AT AS, LIKE, THE OLDER WOMAN,
SHES A MOM.

284
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,159
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

285
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:13,926
SHE DOESNT HAVE A CLUE.

286
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,663
YES!

287
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,632
YES!

288
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:25,771
<i>( APPLAUSE )
 BAMBOO INITIATION.</i>

289
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,342
I THINK KAMA IS OFF TO THE BEST
START I HAVE SEEN ANY TRIBE IN

290
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:30,943
"SURVIVOR" HAVE.

291
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,044
WE HAVE ALL THE RATIONS.

292
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,379
WE HAVE FIRE ON THE FIRST DAY.

293
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,414
WE HAVE A POSITIVE SPIRIT.

294
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,082
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING ON MY MIND.

295
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,351
I HAVE A SECRET ADVANTAGE IN MY
POCKET.

296
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,554
THERE WERE 18 PEOPLE IN THAT
BOAT, AND I FOUND IT.

297
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,356
AND NOW IM THINKING I GOT TO
GET AWAY AND READ THIS THING.

298
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,691
I NEED TO GET SOME MORE WATER.

299
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:49,595
YEAH, DO IT.

300
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:56,869
I SCURRED OFF, AND IVE ONLY
GOT A FEW SPNGDZ "DIG THREE FEET

301
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,371
EAST OF YOUR TREE MAIL."

302
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:05,945
INITIALLY, OF COURSE, IM LIKE,
IM GOING TO GO RIGHT NOW.

303
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,247
IN "SURVIVOR" YOU HAVE TO LIE,
MANIPULATE, TEACH, AND AS A

304
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,716
TEACHER, I HAVE ALL THESE
STUDENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

305
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,450
LOOKING AT ME.

306
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,685
BUT THEYRE NOT STUPID.

307
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,786
THEY KNOW ITS A GAME.

308
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,387
THE RULES ALLOW YOU TO DO THESE
THINGS.

309
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:20,426
OH, MY GOD!

310
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,635
I GOT A MENU.

311
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,137
I WON THE COUPE DE GRACE OF
"SURVIVOR" ADVANTAGES.

312
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,006
I HAVE THE BEST THAT YOU COULD
POSSIBLY HAVE.

313
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,844
IT SAYS, "YOU HAVE FOUND THE
ADVANTAGE MENU THAT ALLOWS YOU

314
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,446
TO CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING.

315
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,616
IF YOU LOSE A CHALLENGE, YOU CAN
STEAL THE REWARD FROM THE OTHER

316
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,216
TRIBE.

317
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,251
OR YOU GET AN EXTRA VOTE.

318
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,487
OR I COULD GET INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.

319
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,688
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

320
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,958
IT WOULD PLAY LIKE A REGULAR
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND I WOULD

321
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:58,931
HAVE TO ANNOUNCE IT BEFORE THE
VOTE WAS READ.

322
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:02,501
COMING IN, MY GOAL WAS NOT TO BE
THE FIRST ONE VOTED OUT.

323
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,137
BUT THIS HAS GIVEN ME A NEW
GOAL.

324
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,641
IM THINKING THIS COULD PROPEL
ME NOT ONLY TO LAST FOR A WHILE

325
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,676
BUT TO WIN "SURVIVOR."

326
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:24,223
♪ ♪
 "EDGE OF EXTINCTION."

327
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,825
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS?

328
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,927
I DONT KNOW, MAN.

329
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,462
I DONT, EITHER.

330
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:35,567
EVERYTHING HAS A REASON.

331
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,902
ITS SO CUTE.

332
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,670
ISNT IT?

333
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,171
LIKE A LITTLE PLACEMAT.

334
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:43,709
MAYBE IM NAIVE BUT I FEEL
LIKE IVE GOTTEN GOOD VIBES FROM

335
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:44,143
EVERYBODY SO FAR.

336
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,044
GOOD.

337
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,645
I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODYS
PUTTING IN WORK.

338
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,780
YEAH.

339
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:51,517
THERE ARE SOME PLAYERS THAT
REALIZE THE VALUE OF STRONG

340
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,785
PEOPLE.

341
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,854
BEING A RETURNEE, IT IS KIND OF
TERRIFYING TO PLAY WITH NEWBIES

342
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,892
BECAUSE IF I POP MY HEAD UP TOO
MUCH, ITS GOING TO GET LOPPED

343
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,761
OFF BECAUSE IM GOING TO HAVE
THAT "RETURNING PLAYER" TARGET.

344
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,098
I FEEL LIKE WERE IN A GOOD
SPOT, THOUGH.

345
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,566
I COULD HELP ON FIRE FOREVER.

346
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,937
SO I KNOW THAT THE BEST THING TO

401
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,637
SHE JUST CANT HELP HERSELF,
MAN.

402
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,539
IN THE SOUTH WE WOULD SAY,
"BLESS HER HEART."

00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,405
TOGETHER TO GET ONE OF THOSE TWO
OUT.

703
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,740
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY NOT WORKING
WITH THEM?

704
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:09,574
NOT YET.

705
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:13,511
AND THEYRE JUST DOGGING RICK
DOWN.

706
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,346
HE DOESNT EVEN HAVE, LIKE, A
CHANCE TO BREATHE.

707
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,981
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

708
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,049
OF THOSE TWO.

709
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,218
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING IN
GENERAL?

710
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,420
SO I WASNT REALLY FEELING
THE WHOLE WELL VIBE.

711
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,622
AND SOMETHING CLICKED IN MY HEAD
THEY HAVE TO START PLAYING THIS

712
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,790
GAME FOR ME.

713
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,694
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, NO
MATTER WHO GOES HOME, I JUST

714
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,162
CANT BE THE ONE TO GO HOME.

715
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:34,265
THEY CROWDED ME AND RICK
INSTANTLY AND THEYRE TRYING TO

716
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,467
PULL RICK TO THEIR SIDE.

717
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,802
AND THE TARGETS ON YALL.

718
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,903
OF COURSE, YEAH.

719
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,972
OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW WHAT WERE
DOOR, RIGHT?

720
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,574
I DEFINITELY THINK WE NEED TO
KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG IS THE

721
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,408
BOTTOM LINE.

722
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,576
LIKE, NO MATTER WHAT.

723
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,745
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A
BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING THE

724
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,382
NEXT CHALLENGE WITH WENDY AND IT
SEEMS THATS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

725
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:51,950
ANYTHING.

726
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,953
I DONT WITH REEM.

727
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,289
IF SOMEONE IT JUST KIND OF
KEEP TABS ON WENDY.

728
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,160
LET ME PULL HER ASIDE AND SEE
WHAT SHE SAYS AND WHO SHE THROWS

729
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,027
OUT THERE.

730
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:09,667
ALL RIGHT, WHY DONT YOU,
YEAH, YEAH.

731
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:14,072
WENTWORTH AND LAUREN, I DONT
LIKE HOW TIGHT THEY ARE.

732
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:17,609
THEYRE A COUPLE, ANDUN COUPLES
ARE THE WIG BIGGEST THREAT.

733
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,111
A LOT OF PEOPLE DONT HAVE
FAITH IN REEM.

734
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,847
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THE
KIND OF PLAYER.

735
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,515
IM VOTING WITH REEM TONIGHT.

736
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,417
JUST OUT OF LOYALTY TO HER.

737
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,552
NO, I GET IT.

738
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:33,758
I FEEL LIKE THEYRE NOT
GIVING ENOUGH CREDIT TO REEM.

739
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,727
THEYRE REALLY JUST TAKING HER
AGE INTO ACCOUNT.

740
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,794
YOU KNOW WHAT?

741
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,429
IM GOING TO PUT ALL THESE RIGHT
IN THE SUN.

742
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:42,400
SHE CANT HELP HER AGE, BUT
SHE CAN PULL HER WAIT WAET,

743
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,568
WHICH SHE HAS BEEN DOING.

744
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,470
I KNOW YOURE TRYING TO SAVE
YOUR FRIEND AND THAT SHOWS

745
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:46,871
LOYALTY BUT ITS A SINKING SHIP.

746
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,605
SHES GOING HOME TONIGHT.

747
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:48,239
THINK ABOUT IT.

748
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,374
LET ME TALK TO DAVID.

749
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:54,045
YOU GUYS TALK, BUT COME BACK
TO ME.

750
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,113
I WILL.

751
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:55,747
IM SERIOUS.

752
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,215
WE WILL, WE WILL.

753
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:01,319
OKAY.

754
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,554
WELL, HERES WHAT IM
THINKING NOW.

755
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,355
OH, NO.

756
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,058
MY MIND HAS CHANGED A LITTLE
BIT.

757
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:07,792
OH, NO.

758
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,295
MAYBE WE JUST TAKE WENDY OUT.

759
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,829
SHES TOO STUBBORN.

760
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,999
WENDY, IT WAS EXTREMELY
SURPRISING TO ME NO MATTER HOW,

761
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,770
LIKE, DIRECT WE WERE TELLING HER
IT WAS GOING TO BE REEM, SHE

762
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:19,737
PUSHED BACK.

763
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,873
AND THATS AT LEAST CAUSING
ALARM IN MY HEAD.

764
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,042
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOWN THE
ROAD?

765
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,710
I CAN WORK WITH SOMEONE LIKE
THAT?

766
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,879
WHAT HELPS ME AND YOU OUT?

767
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,180
WHERE ARE WE BEST?

768
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,849
THIS VOTE TONIGHT I THINK SHOULD
MAYBE BE WENDY.

769
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,017
THEY WANT TO VOTE HER OFF?

770
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,854
THEY WANT TO VOTE ME OFF?

771
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:40,758
WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR NAME OUT
THERE, ITS LIKE, "SCREW YOU,

772
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,993
DUDE."

773
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,028
JUST BECAUSE I DIDNT GO, LIKE,
POWER LIFT BEFORE I SHOWED UP,

774
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,029
LIKE, THEYRE IDIOTS.

775
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,631
I AM SO STRONG.

776
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:50,101
YOU DONT EVEN KNOW THIS OLD
LADY, BRO.

777
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,636
THIS OLD LADY CAN KILL IT.

778
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,005
I KNOW THAT THEYRE THROWING MY
NAME AROUND.

779
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,174
AND I DONT REALLY BLIF A...

780
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:56,841
BECAUSE--
 WOULD YOU PUT THE MACHETE

781
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:58,142
DOWN?

782
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,846
WENTWORTH, DOESNT DNT SHE
GET HURT TODAY?

783
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,348
I DIDNT GET HURT TODAY.

784
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,315
IM NOT DONE.

785
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,083
SCRAPPY, DUDE.

786
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,985
IM NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A
FIGHT.

787
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,787
I DIDNT LEAVE EVERYTHING TO GO
DOWN LIKE THAT.

788
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,823
SCREW THEM, MAN.

789
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,356
♪ ♪
 Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS

790
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,491
A TORCH.

791
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,426
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH,
APPROACH THE FLAME, DIP IT IN

792
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:55,566
AND GET FIRE.

793
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,870
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

794
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,672
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

795
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,609
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO
ARE YOU.

796
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,345
LETS TALK ABOUT FIRST
IMPRESSION.

797
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,181
DEVENS, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE
ABOUT THE INITIAL VIBE OF THE

798
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,416
TRIBE, JUST AS A GROUP?

799
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,252
RIGHT OFF THE BAT, ACTUALLY,
I THINK IT WAS ONE BIG TRIBE.

800
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:18,489
BUT AS THE DAY PROGRESSED, SOME
PEOPLE WERE WEAVING FROND, SOME

801
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,758
PEOPLE WERE WORKING ON THE
SHELTER, SO, OBVIOUSLY, PEOPLE

802
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,961
KIND OF FORMED MINI-GROUPS
WITHIN THE LARGEY GROUP.

803
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,198
Jeff: REEM, DID YOU NOTICE,
THAT PEOPLE PAIRED IN THREES OR

804
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,366
FOURS?

805
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,834
ITS LIKE PEOPLE WHO WERE
WORKING ON CERTAIN THINGS JUST

806
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,969
ENDED UP TALKING BECAUSE THEY
WERE WORKING TOGETHER.

807
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,605
ITS NOT LIKE THEY WERE --
 YOU SEEM ANNOYED ALREADY.

808
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,375
MY NAME GOT THROWN OUT TODAY.

809
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,211
IM PISSED OFF, AND THERES NO
GOOD REASON BEHIND IT.

810
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,548
ITS NOT LIKE PEOPLE WERE
SECRETLY SPEAKING AMONG EACH

811
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,649
OTHER.

812
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,685
THEY WERE JUST DOING THEIR JOBS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

813
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,319
WHATEVER.

814
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,187
IM JUST IN GENERAL ANNOYED.

815
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,955
BUT THAT IS PART OF THIS
GAME.

816
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,757
YOU KNOW, MY NAME WAS THROWN OUT
THERE.

817
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,025
I HEARD LAURENS NAME.

818
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,526
I HEARD REEMS NAME.

819
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,894
ITS HOW THIS GAME IT PLAYED.

820
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,932
FIMAY-- THE REASON WHY HER
NAME WAS EVEN THROWN OUT IS

821
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,366
BECAUSE SHES A LEGEND, YOU
KNOW.

822
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,669
IT WAS AN HONOR TO HAVE HER NAME
THROWN OUT, REALLY.

823
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:08,272
ITS NOT AN HONOR WHEN YOU
CAN STILL BE VOTED OUT.

824
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,507
NO DISRESPECT.

825
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,275
SHE IS A GREAT, GREAT PLAYER.

826
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,244
WHY NOT MENTION DAVIDS NAME?

827
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,079
WHY ME SPECIFICALLY?

828
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,015
IM JUST WONDERING JIEK ILL NOT
DONE.

829
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,018
HERES THE FUNNY THING, MY NAME
WAS THROWN OUT APPARENTLY

830
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,386
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KEEP THE
TRIBE STRONG.

831
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,655
IM GOING WITH AGE
DISCRIMINATION, TO BE QUITE

832
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,857
HONEST WITH YOU.

833
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,726
BECAUSE HOW WOULD YOU KNOW IF I
WASNT STRONG OR NOT STRONG?

834
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,028
I MEAN, DO WE NEED TO HAVE, LIKE
A WRESTLING COMPETITION HERE?

835
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,133
IS THAT SOMETHING WE CAN DO
IN TRIBAL, JEFF?

836
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,201
IM JUST SAYING.

837
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,270
Jeff: REEM, IS THIS NORMAL
FOR YOU?

838
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,505
WHAT?

839
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,341
Jeff: ARE YOU A LITTLE
CONFRONTATIONAL JUST BY NATURE

840
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,542
BACK HOME?

841
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:48,946
NOT CONFRONTATIONAL, BUT IF I
THINK SOMEONES WRONG, ILL

842
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,416
DEFINITELY BE LIKE, "I DONT
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU THINK YOURE

843
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:52,917
RIGHT."

844
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,551
HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

845
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:54,619
THATS WHAT I WAS WONDERING.

846
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,888
IF ANYTHING, REEM, IF
SOMEONES BEING A LITTLE TOO

847
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,689
MUCH, SOMETIMES IT RUBS
DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES THE

848
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,390
WRONG WAY.

849
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,859
WHO WAS I BEING TOO MUCH TO?

850
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,728
TO ME, YOURE A LITTLE TOO
MUCH.

851
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,328
WHY?

852
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,397
WITH WHAT?

853
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,565
YOURE DOING STUFF AND MOVING
THINGS AROUND AND PEOPLE CANT

854
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,701
FIND THEIR THIDGES AND REMIND
PEOPLE TO, LIKE, DRINK THEIR

855
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,170
WATER AND PUT THEIR SHOES ON.

856
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,738
I KNOW THERES GOOD IN ALL OF
THAT.

857
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:14,939
OH, MY GOD.

858
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:15,606
 SOMETIMES PEOPLE DONT WANT

859
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,543
TO HEAR A MOTHERLY FIGURE.

860
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,212
I DID THAT SO NOBODYS STUFF
GOT WET.

861
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,147
TOTALLY AGREE.

862
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,250
I WAS BEING CARING,
CONSIDERATE.

863
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,687
TELL ME MORE.

864
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,088
, PLEASE, ID LOVE TO LEARN.

865
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,357
YOURE TAKING THIS ONE
EXAMPLE AND MILKING IT.

866
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,259
PERSONALITIES CLASH.

867
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,261
WE ALL REALLY LIKE EVERYBODY BUT
ONE PERSON--

868
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,896
IM THE HATED PERSON ON THE
TRIBE.

869
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:43,000
SEE, YOURE PUT-- I NEVER
USED THE WORD "HATED."

870
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,770
IN MY OPINION, YOUR PERSONALITY
WOULD BE HARDEST FOR ME TO DEAL

871
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:46,904
WITH FOR 39 DAYS.

872
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:50,374
BUT YOUR CLOTHES WERE DRY
THOUGH, FOR THE RECORD, WERE

873
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,142
THEY NOT?

Jeff: WENDY, WHERE DO YOU
WEIGH IN ON THIS?

876
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,583
I DO SHARE CONFLICTING PBS
ABOUT REEM.

877
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,851
THE SAME REASONS THEY DISLIKE
HER, I LIKE HER.

878
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,088
IM REALLY CLOSE TO MY MOM, SO
WITH HER BEING HERE, IT KIND OF

879
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:04,956
HELPS ME OUT.

880
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,325
I DONT THINK ANYONE DISLIKES
REEM.

881
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,526
I AGREE.

882
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,627
IF WE HAD SOMETHING HANGING
IN THE TREE, THAT WAS PROBABLY

883
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,929
MY WAY OF DRYING IT OUT.

884
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,265
I CAN JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU
ALL?

885
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,967
IF YOU DIDNT WANT ME TO TOUCH
YOUR STUFF ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS

886
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,169
SAY, "HEY, PLEASE, DONT TOUCH
MY STUFF."

887
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:18,869
DONE.

888
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,804
I APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY, I DO.

889
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,773
IM SORRY I TOUCHED THUR YOUR
THINGS.

890
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,410
Jeff: REEM, WHEN YOU SAY,
"ITS MY FAULT," THATS NOT WHAT

891
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,578
YOU REALLY MEAN?

892
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,081
WHEN I CAME OUT HERE, I
WASNT GOING TO TELL ANYBODY HOW

00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:40,458
