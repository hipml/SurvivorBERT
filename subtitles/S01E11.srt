1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,104
NARRATOR: Last week
on "Survivor", Rich

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,239
woke up with a tribal
council hangover.

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,074
I got bombarded
at the council.

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:11,544
a little alliance tried to
attack Richie on my birthday.

5
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,314
NARRATOR: So he decided to fight
back by catching fewer fish.

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,083
And I'm like,
you backstabbers.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,586
Colleen and Gervase said first
you want him out of here,

8
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,789
and then you're
all over the food.

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,991
Ugh.

10
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,594
NARRATOR: But Sue did some
backstabbing on her own.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,162
I never trusted Rich.

12
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,330
He's a snake!

13
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,565
NARRATOR: And cracks
appeared in the alliance.

14
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,300
Making with Rich is
kind of like making

15
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,036
a deal with the devil.

16
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,874
NARRATOR: But it was Rich
who burned the competition.

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,808
Yeah!

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,643
NARRATOR: And won
the big prize--

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,678
immunity.

20
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,014
Unable to vote for
Rich at the council,

21
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,949
Sue and Kelly stuck
with the alliance

22
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,951
and sent Gervase packing.

23
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,019
Gervase.

24
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,288
NARRATOR: Only six remain.

25
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,957
Who will be voted off tonight?

26
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,527
[theme music]

27
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,704
I just woke up.

28
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,806
I'm wet, so I guess
it rained last night,

29
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,307
but I slept through it.

30
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:26,479
Today is the 31st day, I think.

31
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:30,683
All I know is, this is the
ninth day till the end.

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,920
People were kind of
miserable this morning.

33
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,122
Because I was one
of the miserable.

34
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,524
I mean, every day
is a little tough

35
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,595
because we don't have a lot
to do, and we're low energy.

36
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,966
I think Rich has gotten
really, really weak and really

37
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,635
crabby, and really hungry.

38
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,403
And Sean, also.

39
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,205
I gotta try to put on some
weight before I go home.

40
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,407
Everyone's telling
me I look ugly.

41
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,776
The food I miss but not
as much as my parents.

42
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,313
The hardest part for
me about being here

43
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,714
is that I miss my family.

44
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,318
And like I've reiterated 1,000
times over, I'm no mama's boy,

45
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,420
but I really like
to see my family.

46
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,355
They mean an enormous
amount to me.

47
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,224
When you think of their
smiles and their hugs

48
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,860
and stuff like that, I just
can't wait to see them.

49
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,672
KELLY: Colleen's legs
are pretty beat up.

50
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,173
She's gotten some
pretty bad gashes,

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,709
and she has some sores
up higher on her legs

52
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,177
that she doesn't
know how she got.

53
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,518
COLLEEN: My legs
are bothering me.

54
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,887
I mean, I would
be lying if I said

55
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,155
my legs aren't bothering me.

56
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,358
They hurt a lot.

57
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,826
I have all these.

58
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,962
And then I have these new ones.

59
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,397
I can't sleep because
they itch so bad.

60
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,800
So I get a scar, and
then I itch it off,

61
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,402
and it's like a
never ending cycle.

62
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,738
And they're going to be like
this for the next three years,

63
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,173
you know?

64
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:00,974
Bugs live in them.

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,442
I mean, it's awful.

66
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:06,045
It's so awful.

67
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:10,650
I am feeling like I've
been here for 59,000 days.

68
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,353
The past five days
have been the longest

69
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,756
five days of my entire life.

70
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,091
I miss my old team.

71
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,565
I miss my old beach.

72
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,766
You know?

73
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,436
I am the last sole survivor
of the Pagong Tribe.

74
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,739
I am a dying breed.

75
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,207
Pagong is picked off one by one.

76
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,341
That's obvious.

77
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,511
Now I'm very confused at
where alliances stand,

78
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,581
and I think they're confused
at where alliances stand.

79
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,815
I follow all this.

80
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,617
I'm going to get all of
what's happened up to here.

81
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,918
COLLEEN: Rich and
Sue are promising

82
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,822
one thing to Sean, promising
another thing to Kelly.

83
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,126
Sue and Kelly are promising
one thing to Rich, promising

84
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,427
another thing to Sean.

85
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,663
And then Rudy just sits back
and watches it all happen.

86
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,533
RICHARD: It seems
like Kelly might

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,170
be flip flopping and planning
strategies at our expense.

88
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,506
And that just ticked
Sue off to no end.

89
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,042
Kelly's trying to stay in
the alliance at this time,

90
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,044
but she's trying to make herself
look good to the other team

91
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,513
in case it comes down to the
end and she's going to be

92
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,081
one of the last two standing.

93
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,350
Because she will be like,
oh, I didn't align with them,

94
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,418
I didn't align with them.

95
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,286
And we're like this
time, no, baby doll.

96
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,454
You're not going to look good.

97
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,655
I'm here to play the game.

98
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,290
I'm going to play that game.

99
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,026
I don't give a rat's ass
what people think about me.

100
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,828
I don't have to prove
anything to anybody.

101
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,929
I know who I am.

102
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,464
So who cares?

103
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,666
That's what's so interesting
about this, because I'm getting

104
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,469
to see the breakdown of
the Tagi alliance, which

105
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,837
is really funny.

106
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,573
Everybody is very concerned
about the money at this point.

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,475
Like Sean was saying
for a one in six

108
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,644
chance of winning $1
million, and nobody's

109
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,579
going to throw that away.

110
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,648
They'll be gunning for
us if they're not already.

111
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,283
I think they are.

112
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,285
Comes to the point where we
have to turncoat a little bit,

113
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,687
be a little more strategic, a
little more self preservative.

114
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,222
It's a serious contest.

115
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,658
There's a lot of money
at stake, and I better

116
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,792
start treating it that way.

117
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,127
No one's here just
to make friends

118
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,396
and shake hands and
have relationships

119
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,363
for the rest of the time.

120
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,365
Where's Kelly and Sue?

121
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,200
They went for food.

122
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,601
They went for wood that way?

123
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,769
That way.

124
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,970
So now it's you
and me to the end.

125
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:11,771
Period.

126
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,040
I've given you my word.

127
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,876
You know, if I
got along the way

128
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,512
by somebody that gave me their
word, I'd do something to them.

129
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,013
You're the only one
I've been able to trust

130
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,548
from the beginning.

131
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,816
And you can right to the end.

132
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,685
Right.

133
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,087
COLLEEN: It's definitely
what happens when you

134
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,990
put a big chunk of
cheese in a maze

135
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,660
and let all the mice go at it,
you know, and see who eats who

136
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,929
and who scrambles on top of who.

137
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,031
And I don't want to
be any part of it.

138
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,367
It's not a fun game now.

139
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,914
What does it say?

140
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:55,782
Survivor trivia.

141
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,386
It's not your muscles
you'll strain.

142
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,589
For tomorrow's event,
you'll work out your brain.

143
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,160
We got a clue last night,
and it says you can use

144
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,761
your brain, not your muscles.

145
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,396
Which is good news.

146
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,901
Not that my brain's any
good, but I'd rather

147
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,602
use that than my muscles.

148
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,504
Because the muscles hurt now.

149
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,706
I suck at trivia,
but I love it.

150
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,042
Because you know, I'm
real slow at the buzzer.

151
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,410
But you know what I
was thinking before I

152
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,678
went to bed last night?

153
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,647
I was like, it's going to
be just like a game show.

154
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,581
This is going to be so cool.

155
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,850
Then I was like, wait a minute.

156
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,919
We're on a game show!

157
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,840
My friends, today
decadence speaks.

158
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,041
Oh, we're liking this.

159
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,810
We've taken the visa
and created a really cool

160
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,445
night tonight for one of you.

161
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,246
Oh.

162
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,714
Come on!

163
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,551
One night on a yacht.

164
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,521
That yacht.

165
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,224
But you got your TV
and your stereo, sure.

166
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,427
You got your luxury
dinner with your waiter.

167
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,661
Oh my god.

168
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,298
Fresh sheets, beautiful
bed, and a hot, hot shower.

169
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,433
Pretty simple.

170
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,101
You guys are going to
start at the end, ABC

171
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:22,935
all the way through.

172
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,605
True, false, or multiple choice.

173
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,240
You're going to start
on the blue squares.

174
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,875
And as you answer
questions correctly,

175
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,377
you'll move forward through
the different colors.

176
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,713
Now, if you're the last
one left on a color

177
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,149
that others have already moved
beyond, you're out of the game.

178
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,986
First one on the mat gets
the night on the yacht.

179
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:40,920
Let's do it.

180
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:41,787
Take your spots.

181
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,396
For a night on the
yacht, here we go.

182
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,265
True or false.

183
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,434
Pound for pound,
insects are a better

184
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,904
source of protein than beef?

185
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,005
Stare straight ahead.

186
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,177
Everybody take a step forward.

187
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,279
You are right.

188
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,781
Almost 80% of an insect
is good for protein.

189
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,782
All right.

190
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,551
What must be done
to water collected

191
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:17,023
from inside green bamboo
before it's safe to drink?

192
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,557
A, nothing.

193
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,226
B, it must be strain.

194
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,028
C, it must be boiled.

195
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,598
Or D, it must be distilled.

196
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,066
Nothing is right.

197
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,901
If it's inside the
bamboo, it's OK.

198
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:29,969
Richard, you had it.

199
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,470
Rudy, Colleen, step forward.

200
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,179
Kelly.

201
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,047
What?

202
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,450
You're out, buddy.

203
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,651
Man!

204
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:51,023
If you do not have water,
you should A, not sleep.

205
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,925
B, not eat.

206
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,760
C, stay on your feet.

207
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,162
Or D, stay active.

208
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,436
Everybody move a step forward.

209
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,340
Not eat, because digestion
removes even more fluid.

210
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,874
Susan, I'm sorry.

211
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,076
Yeah, just saying--

212
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,143
yeah, I'm out of here.

213
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,111
Last one.

214
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,280
Join your pal, Kelly.

215
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,082
True or false.

216
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:20,820
If you eat a poisonous mushroom
and survive the first 24 hours,

217
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,556
you have a 90% chance
of full recovery.

218
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,262
Richard, move into the lead.

219
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,931
That is false.

220
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,599
Some mushrooms, in
fact, you recover

221
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,903
from in the first 24 hours and
then die 2 to 10 days later.

222
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,138
Oh, baby!

223
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,841
You can still see the
boat through the fog, Jeff.

224
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,444
What is the longest
venomous snake in the world?

225
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,147
A, King Cobra.

226
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,083
B, giant sea snake.

227
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,919
C, reticulate python.

228
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,355
Or D, Kinabalu pit viper.

229
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,830
Sean, move up with Richard.

230
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,299
It was A, the King Cobra.

231
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,902
True or false, the
dangerous female Black Widow

232
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,205
spider is identified
by a blue hourglass

233
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,607
pattern on her abdomen?

234
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,881
What's the right
answer, Richard?

235
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:22,681
Red.

236
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,649
Red, false.

237
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,084
You and Sean move forward.

238
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,085
We have a showdown.

239
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:26,886
No!

240
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,587
Colleen, Rudy, sorry, guys.

241
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,856
Which of the following?

242
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,994
Can you drink to kill
intestinal parasites?

243
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,663
A, distilled water.

244
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,166
B, mango juice.

245
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,601
C, kerosene.

246
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,270
D, ginger ale.

247
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,079
Both ready?

248
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,180
Yeah.

249
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,881
Richard, you really
wanted that, didn't you?

250
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:56,782
Did I lose it?

251
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,851
Sean, congratulations.

252
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,152
C, kerosene.

253
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,721
Oh, I thought
that would kill you.

254
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,090
Good job.

255
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,559
Sean, congratulations.

256
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,394
That yacht right
there is all yours.

257
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,963
One night, hot shower, hot
towels, and everything else

258
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,931
we talked about.

259
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,632
Way to go, man.

260
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,767
Good job, Seany.

261
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,470
Oh, Sean, here's one
more thing to consider.

262
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,239
One other person may
be able to join you

263
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,109
for breakfast on that yacht.

264
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,010
So I'll let that sort
of ruminate in your head

265
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,880
as you contemplate
this whole thing.

266
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,915
Otherwise, it's going
to be a great night.

267
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:30,850
Party on the boat!

268
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,717
Woo!

269
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,805
SEAN: OK, yesterday
I won a challenge,

270
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,373
an island trivia contest.

271
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,342
The reward to the challenge
was, lucky for me,

272
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,345
is a night on this
luxurious yacht.

273
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,747
I understand there's
going to be food,

274
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:07,653
I hope dessert, a warm shower,
television, maybe a newspaper.

275
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,955
But hopefully I get to
bring some company with me.

276
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,157
I'm allowed one person.

277
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,759
I owe Kelly a dinner,
so she's coming with me.

278
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,860
I really like Sean.

279
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,662
I probably talked a
lot of trash about Sean

280
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,531
because he's neurotic
and talks a lot,

281
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,032
but he's really a good guy.

282
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,333
If he does get to
bring one person,

283
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,701
he said he's going
to bring me, so I'm

284
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,936
a little stoked up about that.

285
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,471
I might get to go spend
a night on a yacht,

286
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,539
which would be cool.

287
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,274
Because if I could
spend a night on a yacht

288
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,610
and shower and eat some
food, I'd be good to go

289
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,678
for another seven days.

290
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,763
This is an
ungodly type of rain

291
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,531
that we're not used
to in the States.

292
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,000
You know, I've seen some heavy
rain pours in New York City,

293
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,669
but this is heavy, heavy rain.

294
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,404
I mean, serious rain.

295
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,239
This is really horrible.

296
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,707
Survival of the fittest.

297
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,710
Who can stand in an umbrella
in the rain the longest.

298
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,046
That piece of
crap parachute thing

299
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,581
has been the most
waterproof thing

300
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,115
we've had on this whole island.

301
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:15,087
So a lot of people have been
crowding up underneath that.

302
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,488
Today is raining.

303
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,023
Last night it was raining.

304
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,229
And I think tomorrow it
will probably be raining.

305
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,097
This is definitely
the worst day.

306
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,332
MAN: Definitely the
worst day by far.

307
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,033
And it's really bad,
because it's probably

308
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,134
going to be like this tomorrow.

309
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,309
As far as rain, I think
it was a big deterrent

310
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,510
to a lot of people.

311
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,646
It really kind of ate at them.

312
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,714
Oh my God.

313
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,416
I don't know if I
want to [inaudible]..

314
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,553
Ornery, tired, hungry, cold.

315
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,787
Put it this way.

316
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,889
It beats driving a semis
through Chicago at 4 o'clock

317
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,791
on a Friday summer afternoon.

318
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,111
Thank God for the sun.

319
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,280
So the sky's really
clear, and everybody's

320
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,081
drying out and warming up.

321
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:16,949
Good stuff.

322
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,800
Rainbow.

323
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,668
Pretty.

324
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,176
Check out the
rainbow you're on.

325
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,844
Wow.

326
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,146
That's great!

327
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,614
What's happening, Jeff?

328
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,115
Well, you know,
I wish I was coming

329
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,251
here to say that everybody
was going on the yacht.

330
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,653
So do we.

331
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,621
Let's go.

332
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,422
See you, buddy.

333
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,222
Have fun.

334
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,090
See you in the morning.

335
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,458
See you guys tomorrow.

336
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,259
Have fun.

337
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,127
See you guys.

338
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:02,928
Bye, guys.

339
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,096
Sorry you're not coming.

340
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,469
Sean finally leaves to go
off to his yacht excursion.

341
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,638
And then he hollers
out, hey, I can

342
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,106
invite somebody for breakfast.

343
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,175
I can invite
someone for breakfast.

344
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,376
Who wants it?

345
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,011
Take her?

346
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,146
Kelly, do you want
that to be your meal?

347
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,681
Sean, it's your decision.

348
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,417
Don't pawn it off on me.

349
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,121
Yeah, Sean, get some
balls and make a decision!

350
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,056
Richie, scrambled eggs.

351
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,257
See you in the morning, Hatch!

352
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,696
Sean makes up his mind
and he invites Rich.

353
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,630
Come on, Rich.

354
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,100
You need a boost!

355
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,535
Sean kept saying how
he was going to take me.

356
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,404
And then last
minute, he said, Oh.

357
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,439
Oh, Rich, you like eggs
for breakfast, don't you?

358
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,240
OK.

359
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,141
Me and you, Rich.

360
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,909
I'll take you.

361
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:51,710
The guy's dumb.

362
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:52,845
He's so dumb.

363
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:53,712
Is he not?

364
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,486
Sean is probably
eating lots of food.

365
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,356
I wonder if he's got pizza.

366
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,959
You know, we're all hungry, and
tired, and dirty, and bored.

367
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,267
He'll probably shave and bathe.

368
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,305
He might get a massage.

369
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,840
I don't think he's
ever had a massage.

370
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,180
Oh, that feels so good, Jane.

371
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,314
I just hope the
poor kid doesn't

372
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,349
make a fool out of himself.

373
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,152
Does my ass look
as boney as it feels?

374
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,521
[slap]

375
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,024
The captain, he's not going
to be steering all night.

376
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,025
He's going to go to sleep.

377
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,860
I just wanted to
introduce him to you.

378
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,061
Just for, you know.

379
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,930
But this guy just
really wanted to say hi.

380
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,832
And you know, he's
familiar with the show.

381
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,100
He's certainly familiar with you
and everything that's going on.

382
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,035
OK.

383
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,636
So come on in
and take the oar.

384
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:25,437
Whatever.

385
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,672
Hi.

386
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,106
Captain.

387
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:28,874
Captain.

388
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,609
Hey, Dad!

389
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,110
Oh, my god!

390
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,111
Holy Toledo!

391
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,012
How are you?

392
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,813
How's my boy.

393
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,248
Oh, Pops, I love you.

394
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,049
I love you, too, son.

395
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,350
Oh my God!

396
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,518
You look fantastic.

397
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,320
Oh my God!

398
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,722
I can't believe you
got my father here.

399
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,690
Oh my God.

400
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,292
Dad, you made my
whole adventure.

401
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,262
I cannot tell you
how much more this

402
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,997
is worth than $1 million to me.

403
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,499
I can't even tell you.

404
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,334
I thought the
reward, ample enough,

405
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,505
to spend a night on a yacht,
get a massage, shower, shave.

406
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,207
And to see my father there,
I mean, it was just a dream

407
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,208
come true.

408
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,009
--so, so much.

409
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:04,843
Are you kidding me?

410
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,944
You can't beat him.

411
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,081
He's got a heart twice
as big as this body.

412
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,449
It's twice as big as your body.

413
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,585
It's the truth, son.

414
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,020
I'd walk on nails, coals.

415
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:15,821
I don't care.

416
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,788
Anything.

417
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,423
Yeah, me too.

418
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,092
Me too.

419
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,261
I don't know why
our bond's so strong.

420
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,095
It is.

421
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,963
But we got a very strong bond.

422
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,964
You're the best.

423
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:26,899
The dad is looped.

424
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:27,766
Yeah, yeah.

425
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,435
Have my wine.

426
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,637
I am so happy right now.

427
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:37,910
[inaudible]

428
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:48,554
I just wish Sean would just
get a backbone sometimes.

429
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,624
It irks me, the way he
tried to put it on me.

430
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,260
Like, I'm going to bring you,
but you can pass it on to Rich

431
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,328
if you want to.

432
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,930
Like he didn't want
to be the [muted]..

433
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,232
he didn't want to want to
have to make the decision that

434
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,233
was his to make.

435
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,738
It's dawn, and I'm
looking at the yacht.

436
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,442
Sean's probably still
sleeping, but it

437
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,478
won't be long before they
come get me for breakfast.

438
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,888
Rich, get your
skinny ass down here.

439
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,624
My skinny ass?

440
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,591
Hey.

441
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,059
Hey, tell Sean he's
in big trouble!

442
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,599
Tell Sean he's got to deal with
Wigglesworth when he gets back!

443
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,400
Wow.

444
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,769
That'll spoil his whole morning.

445
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:11,837
Hey, she's hungry!

446
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,750
It's not even the food
that pissed me off.

447
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:25,817
That's a point of it.

448
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,185
It's the point that
he's been going on,

449
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,553
and on, and on, about how--

450
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,821
How he screwed you
out of of a meal.

451
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,323
How he screwed
me and he owes me.

452
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,358
And then when it comes
down to it, he can't even--

453
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,498
Where's Sean at?

454
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:43,568
Hey!

455
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,503
There he is.

456
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,771
Hey, Captain.

457
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:46,805
I take it that's the captain.

458
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,840
That's his captain, all right.

459
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,142
Did you have a good night?

460
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,476
I thought you needed
something to pull

461
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,578
you out of your doldrums.

462
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,447
This is going to do it, buddy.

463
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,419
Up we go.

464
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,953
Seany.

465
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,355
Thanks for the shower
and everything.

466
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,156
My pleasure.

467
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,058
Welcome to breakfast.

468
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,759
Meet the captain.

469
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,762
Also known as Jim
Kenniff, my father.

470
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,763
Oh.

471
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,031
He is not!

472
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:13,899
Yeah.

473
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,636
Holy Moses!

474
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,437
It was good.

475
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,571
It was enjoyable.

476
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,107
I just kept eating while
they talked and answered

477
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,076
questions as I chewed.

478
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,777
It was rocking pretty hard.

479
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,813
Yeah, plus you get an
hour boat right here,

480
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,649
and then we tossed back
two bottles of wine.

481
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,250
Recognized how much
we loved each other.

482
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,219
You know, all that
good father-son stuff.

483
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,187
Oh my God.

484
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,988
Just dump it out.

485
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,324
This is all your guys' food.

486
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,258
What is this?

487
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,293
Cinnamon rolls?

488
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,928
Yes, it is.

489
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,229
Thanks for picking me, Sean.

490
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,330
Cheers, cheers.

491
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,164
Nice to meet you, Dad.

492
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,032
Yeah, I'm a little--

493
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:47,899
No worries.

494
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,777
Six more days of rice.

495
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,980
I might even skip the last
day of eating altogether.

496
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:02,848
Just to not eat rice.

497
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,860
Mexican food.

498
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,362
Chips.

499
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,363
Chips and salsa.

500
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,334
Then guacamole.

501
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,870
Enchiladas.

502
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,439
Sean is seeing that he's
in a little bit of trouble,

503
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,041
and that he should probably
have Rich out there,

504
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,910
because Richard's going
to make sure that I get

505
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,879
voted off tonight and not him.

506
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,480
Maybe somewhere
he's thinking that.

507
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,349
He's smart if he's
thinking that.

508
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,650
I like that.

509
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,018
Good job, Sean.

510
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,088
I can't figure it out, why
he switched at the last minute.

511
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,725
But all them ladies
are pissed off at him.

512
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,360
Richard better
bring a haul back.

513
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,871
Literally.

514
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,606
I have so much to tell you guys.

515
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,375
I am definitely getting--

516
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,943
oh, you all right?

517
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,712
You all right?

518
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,414
I got caught in the rope.

519
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,450
Six out of six votes tonight.

520
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,752
Unless you came
back with something,

521
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,487
we don't care if you're back.

522
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,988
This is my father, guys.

523
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:17,789
Meet Mr. Kenniff.

524
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:18,924
Come on over here.

525
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,724
What?

526
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,525
Sean's father.

527
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,260
Shut up.

528
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,695
What?

529
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,163
So much to tell you guys.

530
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,333
Yeah, we can tell him how
dumb you were not to take

531
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,468
Kelly with when you owed her.

532
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,337
You know, he kept
some food for everybody.

533
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,471
Pay back your debts before--

534
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:34,339
Hi.

535
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,408
He bought-- he
got food for us.

536
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,475
Colleen, Sue.

537
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,610
Hi.
Hi, Sue.

538
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,411
Kelly.

539
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,645
I thought about it.

540
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,480
He's provided food
for us 50 times.

541
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,249
When Sean's dad first
came, to tell you the truth,

542
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,550
I almost cried.

543
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:49,254
Because I started thinking
about my mom, and I got so--

544
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,455
a lot.

545
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,624
You know, Sean just
gets all the breaks.

546
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,125
But you know, it was good.

547
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,327
It was good.

548
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,229
I felt happy for him,
and he is the family kid.

549
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,397
You know, so it
was good for him.

550
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,600
It was nice to have a new
face around and stuff.

551
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,534
Never caught a fish.

552
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,535
Never caught a fish.

553
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,903
Super pole 2000.

554
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,005
And nothing has been
happening in the news.

555
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,540
I know you're all
wondering what's happening.

556
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,374
There's nothing going on.

557
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,775
It's boring, eh?

558
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,777
What's the stock
market's been doing?

559
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,212
Staying steady or going up?

560
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,013
Oh, no.

561
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,414
We had some bad days there.

562
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,616
Did you?

563
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,784
400 and something points
on the NASDAQ went down.

564
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,585
What's it down to?

565
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,586
What's the NASDAQ down?

566
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,687
It didn't bounce up.

567
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,357
I haven't-- the last
few days, I don't know.

568
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,092
Actually, for him
to come and visit

569
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,394
the camp was sort of cool,
but he didn't know anything!

570
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,731
So that war over in Russia
sort of mellowed out?

571
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:33,565
What?

572
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,599
They had the one there.

573
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,600
Chechen.

574
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,501
Oh, the Chechen?

575
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,435
- Yeah
- I don't know.

576
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:38,536
I don't know.

577
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,038
We're like, what's
going on in the world?

578
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,706
He didn't know none of that.

579
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,275
What about the college playoffs?

580
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,342
Who won?
- I don't--

581
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,143
Oh, yeah.

582
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,145
Wait a minute.

583
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,413
No.

584
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,581
Yeah?

585
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,448
No.

586
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:53,985
Who the hell won?

587
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,987
See, I'm not really
a sports fan.

588
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,189
Oh, he's just like Sean.

589
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,993
He's just lovable but doof.

590
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,397
I'm gonna say
goodbye to my father.

591
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,065
Tired?

592
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,433
Pleasure to meet you, Jim.

593
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,701
Same here.

594
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,403
I've got something
for all of you.

595
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,203
Oh, yeah?

596
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,004
Oh, geez.

597
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:13,805
Oh, boy.

598
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,407
Like Santa Claus.

599
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,908
Daddy Claus.

600
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,677
What's this stuff?

601
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,978
This is [inaudible].

602
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:20,779
Real funny, Dad.

603
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,681
Guess what this is.

604
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,882
He needs clothes, see?

605
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,350
What about everybody else?

606
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,518
Then right when
he goes to leave

607
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,154
this afternoon, about an
hour an a half, hour ago,

608
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,922
he has this gray bag.

609
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,458
And in it there's a care
package for each one of us.

610
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,760
Rich.

611
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,163
Thank you.

612
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,965
Somebody's grateful.

613
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,866
Kelly.

614
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,235
So nice.

615
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,572
Oh, look at this!

616
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,241
So in it we each got a little
something from one of our loved

617
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,078
ones from back home.

618
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,580
Thank you!

619
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,016
I don't know.

620
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,084
You know that is, don't you?

621
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,493
Even though we are
apart, just remember,

622
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,662
you are always in my heart.

623
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,530
We all got thrown
a bone, which was

624
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,333
amazingly wonderfully great.

625
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,869
Because now I feel like I can
do this for six more days.

626
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,137
And I definitely will.

627
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,172
I'm on a sugar high right now.

628
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,307
More than I have
been in a month.

629
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,242
So I feel like I can
do anything right now.

630
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,043
Thank you so much!

631
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,678
Oh, my pleasure.

632
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:27,779
Unbelievable.

633
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,080
I love this.
This is so nice.

634
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,648
Thanks for being the
bearer of good treasure.

635
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,350
Great meeting you all.

636
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,184
Love youse all.

637
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:33,985
Pop, I love you.

638
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,187
My son, my son, my son.

639
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,722
Tell my mother I love her.

640
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,790
Oh, I will.

641
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:39,591
Oh.

642
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,425
I'll tell everybody.

643
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,526
Tell them I'll see them soon.

644
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:47,966
Bye, Pop!

645
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,100
Thank you!

646
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:49,968
Thank you!

647
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,339
Plenty of food.

648
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,607
I don't care.

649
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,242
I'm drifting away for a while,
just kind of going home.

650
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,978
And it's phenomenal.

651
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,180
God, I can't wait
to get out of here.

652
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:06,251
Sean's father came back with a
bag filled with things for each

653
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,420
of us from particular people.

654
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,889
And this made it from
the most wonderful woman

655
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,791
on the planet, Valerie.

656
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,895
She just printed out
the email that she was--

657
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,664
was having with her husband,
who's another incredible man,

658
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,865
close friend of mine.

659
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:24,169
And it just takes me back
to my real world life,

660
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:29,674
and has my brain
engaged and rejuvenated,

661
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,644
and out of these 16
whoever they are people,

662
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,281
and into who I am, and just
knowing what's going on

663
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,417
and that it's back there, and
what I'm about to experience

664
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,719
when I go back.

665
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,756
You know, I can last the other
whatever's left, seven days,

666
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,623
six days.

667
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,704
Hey, guys.

668
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,572
Hi, Jeff.

669
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,974
This challenge
is for immunity.

670
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,111
Whoever wins gets the
talisman, cannot be voted off

671
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,645
at tonight's tribal council.

672
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,981
It's all about will, this game.

673
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,749
You're going to be
standing on planks.

674
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,219
Over a period of time, I'm
going to remove certain planks

675
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,620
till we get down to one plank.

676
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:19,157
Last person standing gets the
talisman and is safe tonight.

677
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,692
This game can take 15 minutes.

678
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:22,393
It can take 15 hours.

679
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,995
You will decide that.

680
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,831
Only rule-- you
can't touch anybody.

681
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,400
But you can taunt all you want.

682
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,336
All right, let's
go out and do it.

683
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,652
Survivors ready?

684
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,653
Ready.

685
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,521
Go.

686
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:50,822
OK!

687
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:51,689
Got it.

688
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,750
Did you think somebody
would be gone yet?

689
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:19,584
No.

690
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,486
You now why I'm cutting.

691
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,397
I'm pulling this board.

692
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,545
81 bottles of
beer on the wall.

693
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,447
81 bottles of beer!

694
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,550
You take one down,
you pass it around,

695
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,686
80 bottles of beer on the wall.

696
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,554
80 bottles of beer on the wall.

697
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,823
Say, 80 bottles of beer.

698
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:04,162
You take one down, pass it
around and 79 bottles of beer

699
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,663
on the wall!

700
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,631
It's moving.

701
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,532
Damn it, Rich.

702
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,567
79 bottles of
beer on the wall.

703
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,236
79 bottles of beer.

704
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,771
You take one down,
pass it around,

705
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,140
78 bottles of beer on the wall.

706
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,478
78 bottles of beer on the
wall, 78 bottles of beer.

707
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,879
Woo!

708
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:22,981
77 bottles of
beer on the wall.

709
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:23,881
You just gave up?

710
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:24,682
No.

711
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:25,750
You just dropped?

712
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,584
I dropped.

713
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,619
He couldn't take it anymore.

714
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:28,786
77 bottles of beer!

715
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:29,654
I slipped.

716
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,659
65 bottles of beer!

717
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:39,530
You take one down,
pass it around,

718
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,367
64 bottles of beer on the wall!

719
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:46,871
Out of the way, buddy.

720
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,208
I'm sorry to leave
you without my music.

721
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,342
Please.

722
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,143
See you onshore.

723
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,011
Amen to that.

724
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:53,878
Hey, Rich.

725
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:00,118
So it's ironic that
Colleen is even trying.

726
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,753
Because she thinks
she's dead tonight.

727
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:02,754
I asked her today.

728
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,988
I said, Colleen,
what makes you happy?

729
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,958
And she said, you know,
Rich, irony makes me happy.

730
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,192
So I think it's
ironic that she's

731
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,361
trying to stay on the
board, and she's not even

732
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,197
in danger of getting voted off.

733
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,333
Kelly, on the other hand,
has no idea that she's

734
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,268
leaving this evening.

735
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,903
But it's still--

736
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,873
I'll bet Sean gets two
votes from the girls.

737
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:24,709
Yeah, Sean may get
votes from Colleen.

738
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,044
Colleen and--

739
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,212
And maybe Kelly,
just to throw a vote.

740
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,348
Yeah, because Kelly's
trying to look as if she's

741
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,949
not part of the voting bloc.

742
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:32,750
Like, oh.

743
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,019
Ooh, ooh, ooh, go!

744
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:35,820
Go!

745
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:36,621
Look at her.

746
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,555
She's almost gone.

747
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,656
But she's miss dancer.

748
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,092
So maybe she's got balance.

749
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,528
Well, he's cut one side.

750
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,730
Now he;s cut the other,
and they're all wobbling.

751
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,531
Look at the wobble.

752
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,932
And the play by play.

753
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,301
As we look at Sue, she's got the
arms up level across the side,

754
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,904
but Kelly, holy Moses, she
looks like she's going.

755
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,771
Back and forth.

756
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,341
Oh, no.

757
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,310
Colleen looking rather
stable, although determined,

758
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,245
really trying to hang
on, thinking she's

759
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,082
about to be ejected
this evening.

760
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,184
Sean just-- there he goes.

761
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,754
Sean falls off the board,
and it is down to 3.

762
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,555
Look at them.

763
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,957
Oh, Sue.

764
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,659
It's Kelly and Colleen.

765
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,660
Holy Moses.

766
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:25,236
OK, Sue, so if Kelly wins
immunity, what happened?

767
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,004
Sean or Colleen?

768
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,039
I'm thinking Sean.

769
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,374
Are you thinking
Sean before Colleen?

770
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,275
What are you thinking?

771
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,710
I'll go with
what you guys say.

772
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,778
What do you think?

773
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,179
I'm feeling, you
know, aw, Sean, Sean.

774
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,648
But we've been Aw, Sean,
Seaning, you know--

775
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:38,816
SUE: I think it was [inaudible].

776
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:39,617
OK.

777
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,952
Rudy says Sean.

778
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:44,756
So If Kelly hangs in there,
Sean is out of here tonight.

779
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,091
So we got to watch, because
it's down to the wire.

780
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,562
Oh my God.

781
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,398
You aren't cold after being
out there for so long?

782
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,233
I got to dry off
before I put clothes on.

783
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,300
No, no.

784
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,069
I'm fatter than you, remember?

785
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:58,870
RICHARD: There Kelly.

786
00:33:58,936 --> 00:33:59,670
RUDY: They're both gone.

787
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:00,972
They're both waving.

788
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:02,707
RICHARD: I think when one
wobbles, the other wobbles.

789
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,842
Oh, God, Colleen.

790
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,310
This is good.

791
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,645
This is really good.

792
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,629
Am I getting
voted off if I fall?

793
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,664
Not by me

794
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,465
By the rest?

795
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,434
I don't know, honey.

796
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,401
I don't know.

797
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,402
I'm guessing yes.

798
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,485
Kelly, you got immunity.

799
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,386
Colleen moved.

800
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:51,823
Woo!

801
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,194
Well done.

802
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,697
Very well done.

803
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,732
Because this is so--

804
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,034
all you guys were
doing out there

805
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,169
was saying "my feet are
dying, my feet are dying,"

806
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,572
what are you wearing to
tribal council tonight?

807
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,406
Shoes?

808
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,207
Shoes?

809
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,909
OK, insoles from Dr. Scholz.

810
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,312
Hopefully they'll give you
a little padding on that.

811
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,948
Good job, Kelly!

812
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,015
Thank you.

813
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,560
This stupid alliance thing.

814
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,062
I don't even care
about that anymore.

815
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,797
You know, I say I'm not.

816
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,065
I'm not in it anymore.

817
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,466
I'm voting my conscience.

818
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,369
And you know, I want
to be true to myself

819
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,438
and who I am and
keep my dignity.

820
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,606
Who cares?

821
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,509
Kelly, she was a double
agent, so to speak.

822
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,444
You know, talking to
the Pagong people,

823
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,845
really trying to
get in with them,

824
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,715
and then relaying everything
we said to her teammates.

825
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:53,718
The Pagong people
fortunately picked up on that.

826
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,253
Because they all
came to me in unison.

827
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,121
They said, they think
Kelly is up to no good.

828
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,157
And so it was very
plastic, very see-through.

829
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,327
And even her biggest
advocate on this island, Sue,

830
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,428
saw right through that.

831
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,530
I'm voting strategically.

832
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,664
So are they.

833
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,366
And they still think I'm
in the stupid alliance.

834
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,635
Because if I told them I didn't
want to be, they'd vote me off.

835
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,303
So I'm trying to
save my own ass.

836
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,839
So how bold and
wonderful is that?

837
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,174
Me and Kelly, I thought we
had a real friendship going.

838
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,543
I really did.

839
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,745
But when I turn around
and see somebody

840
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,713
starting to dig a
knife into my backside,

841
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,916
it just really pisses me off.

842
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,118
I don't care what
I say to people.

843
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:32,089
I don't care if I'm nice
to anybody at camp anymore.

844
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,691
I do not give a [muted].

845
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,459
And it feels so good.

846
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,260
It's great.

847
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,228
I love it.

848
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,708
Welcome to tribal council 11.

849
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,109
We're going to bring
in our jury now.

850
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:56,147
It consists of Greg,
Jenna, and as of last week,

851
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,983
Gervase, who was the
last person voted off.

852
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,618
Two of you will make
it to the final vote.

853
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,753
The other four will
join these three,

854
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,890
and we'll decide who
gets the $1 million.

855
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,458
So let's talk about
what's gone on

856
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,826
since the last tribal council.

857
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:13,631
A busy, busy time, a lot of
it hovering around you, Sean.

858
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,499
One decision, though,
you had to make

859
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:19,770
was right as we left heading out
to the yacht, I said you know

860
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,672
what, why don't you invite
somebody for breakfast?

861
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,473
Correct.

862
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,774
Put you in a tough spot.

863
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,842
Very tough spot.

864
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,010
You had to pick somebody.

865
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,180
Absolutely.

866
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:31,315
So what made you change
your mind at the last minute?

867
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,783
Rich provides food.

868
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,919
You know, the women that I
was blessed for on the island.

869
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,088
But let's not forget the
fact that you said, "Kelly,

870
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,356
all right, I'm
going to take you,

871
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,191
but you can give it to
Rich, so I don't know.

872
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,425
It's in your hands."
- Let me tell you.

873
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,760
I'll tell you why.
And she knows it.

874
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:43,861
You tried to
pawn it off on me.

875
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,596
Rich also gave us
tons, tons of food.

876
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,431
He goes out every day
fishing for four hours,

877
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,167
comes back with something in
his basket 9 out of 10 times.

878
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,069
Which is really
great for the tribe.

879
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,004
But you didn't say that.

880
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,404
SEAN: But that's
what I'm thinking.

881
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:54,205
So.

882
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,272
A day later.

883
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,607
SEAN: No, what do you
mean, a day later?

884
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:57,808
Not at all.

885
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,543
He was in my thoughts when
I mentioned breakfast.

886
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,179
He really wanted to go on
that ship during the contest.

887
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,482
I factored all that into
it, and I said, tell me,

888
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,416
who wants to come?

889
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,384
And I yelled from
the ship, and I

890
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,918
just made an instant decision.

891
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,820
If it was the wrong one and
it gets me a boat from Kelly,

892
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,155
I'm sorry, Kelly.
But either way.

893
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,223
It's not about the food, Sean.

894
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,591
Yeah.

895
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,259
It's the fact that the whole
day before you were saying,

896
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,394
oh, I'm going to take you.

897
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,062
I mean, you don't
owe me anything.

898
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:18,963
It's not about that.

899
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,097
So?

900
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,499
It's just the fact that
you were just saying--

901
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,600
I felt obliged.

902
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,401
that's all.

903
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,568
OK, Richard.

904
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,836
Yeah.

905
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,472
JEFF: Two tribal councils
ago, you got three votes.

906
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,674
Yeah.

907
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,410
The only thing that saved
you was the now infamous

908
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,379
alphabet system, which
cast a vote for Jenna

909
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,514
was the swing vote.

910
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,049
I mean, other people
voted for Jenna,

911
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,850
but it was that swing
vote that was based

912
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,419
on the alphabet that saved you.

913
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,486
Looked that way, yeah.

914
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,622
It seems like at
this point, if I'm just

915
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,957
looking at it on
paper, you would be

916
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,626
in a very precarious situation.

917
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,094
I could be going home tonight.

918
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,062
Absolutely.

919
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,463
How about you, Colleen?

920
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,132
Last tribal council you said,
I'm either going tonight, Jeff,

921
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,901
or I'm going the
next tribal council.

922
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,235
I mean, I'm feeling--

923
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,038
I'm feeling-- I'm
feeling like I'm going.

924
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,373
Yeah, I mean, I'm the last.

925
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,176
I'm the last of my kind here.

926
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,812
I'm the last Pagong.

927
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,146
So yeah.

928
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:13,017
JEFF: What's your gut on
how nasty it's going to get?

929
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,386
Hmm, what's my gut on how
nasty it's going to get?

930
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,221
It's going to get pretty nasty.

931
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,591
There's a lot of stuff going on.

932
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,559
OK, it's time to vote.

933
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,426
Rich.

934
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,402
Oh.

935
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,446
Why are you going tonight?

936
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,814
Because you screwed up.

937
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,849
It wasn't your turn.

938
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,885
And you were supposed to stay.

939
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,054
So you're actually being
sacrificed, even though you

940
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,557
were supposed to stay.

941
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,292
But good night.

942
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,346
I can't vote for myself,
so I got to vote for Sean.

943
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:18,949
Because same reason
as last week, really.

944
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:19,750
He knows.

945
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,584
He knows.

946
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:34,799
"24/7" is all I have to say.

947
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,573
I'm voting for Colleen.

948
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,974
Even though she calls
me a putz all the time,

949
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,577
I know we're good friends,
and I like her a lot.

950
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,611
She's a cool girl.

951
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:48,479
So I'm voting.

952
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,748
I'm changing her
name to Cooleen.

953
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,782
And she's really cool, though.

954
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,350
I enjoyed her company.

955
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:57,154
And I'll probably see her
next vote in the jury.

956
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:08,098
Across from you now are
10 torches representing

957
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,900
the first 10 people voted off.

958
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,470
Tonight, we will add one
more staff to that group.

959
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,572
I'll go tally the votes.

960
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,069
Once the votes are tallied,
the decision is final.

961
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,371
The person will be asked to
leave the island immediately.

962
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,840
They will return, however,
to the next tribal council

963
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:53,677
as the fourth member
of our final jury.

964
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:54,545
I'll read the votes.

965
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:04,488
First vote, Sean.

966
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:12,296
Colleen.

967
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:17,801
Colleen.

968
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,645
Sean.

969
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,580
Two votes for Colleen,
two votes for Sean.

970
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,353
Three votes Colleen.

971
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,298
Colleen, you need to
bring me your torch.

972
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,700
(WHISPERING) Be nice
to each other, OK?

973
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:50,901
I swear, I'm watching you.

974
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:54,738
Bye.

975
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:55,606
OK.

976
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,644
Play fair, OK?

977
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,989
JEFF: Colleen, the
tribe has spoken.

978
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,297
Step forward.

979
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,846
Well, I heard Colleen's last
words, "play fair, be nice."

980
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,481
She's a wonderful person.

981
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,616
JEFF: You guys can grab your
torches and head back to camp.

982
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,404
NARRATOR: Next
week on "Survivor."

983
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,007
This is the most
conniving bunch of people

984
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,308
I have ever met in my life.

985
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,243
There's not an honest
one in the bunch.

986
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,714
Things are falling apart
here at Rattanna Beach.

987
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:12,416
Oh, and you told him you
weren't aligned with us.

988
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,884
Because colleen told me that.

989
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,718
That's bull.

990
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:15,819
Well, I don't give a [muted].

991
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,588
Because I trust her
more than I trust you.

992
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,597
I had a lot of fun,
and the past week

993
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:29,099
was actually the hardest
part of the whole thing.

994
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,235
I'm excited now
for the next step.

995
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,170
I want to sit in the jury box.

996
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,906
If I came into this
game on Tagi's team,

997
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:36,974
I think I could have won.

998
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,342
I'm just going to
say it, you know.

999
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,377
I mean, no harm in saying it
now after I've been kicked off

1000
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,412
and I didn't win.

1001
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,380
But really, I think
I could have won.
