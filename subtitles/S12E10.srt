>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,797
>> I have to make fire from

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,923
scratch.

5
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:07,465
>> Here another day, my man.

6
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,258
>> PROBST: Terry, Sally and

7
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,093
Austin face discouraging odds

8
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,928
against the six remaining former

9
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:12,345
Casaya tribe mates.

10
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,972
>> They're sitting there all

11
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:14,806
happy because they have the

12
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:15,807
numbers.

13
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,641
But if I can draw two of

14
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,267
those people over to our side,

15
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,812
the tables could turn.

16
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:21,730
>> PROBST: At the reward

17
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,313
challenge, the Survivors were

18
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,607
randomly divided into three

19
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,817
teams and played for breakfast

20
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,026
in bed.

21
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,904
Bruce, Aras, Sally win reward!

22
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:30,447
Who's going to Exile Island?

23
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,072
>> Austin.

24
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,198
>> PROBST: This time the winners

25
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,284
were forced to send two people

26
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,493
to Exile Island.

27
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,911
Austin, Danielle, the boat's

28
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,121
waiting for you.

29
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,790
While Sally, Bruce and Aras

30
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,126
enjoyed breakfast in bed,

31
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,045
Danielle and Austin suffered

32
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,173
together on Exile Island.

33
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,467
>> Out of all the people that I

34
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,051
had to get stuck on the island,

35
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:52,552
I'm glad it was Austin.

36
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,763
I have a little bit more trust

37
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,055
built with him.

38
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,807
Logically, Austin would be,

39
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,225
you know, a backup plan.

40
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,102
>> PROBST: Back at camp, Terry

41
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,729
tricked Shane into revealing the

42
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,354
Casaya pecking order.

43
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,152
>> I found out some very

44
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,236
important stuff.

45
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,405
Danielle and Bruce are next on

46
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,364
the pecking order.

47
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,282
And if I can get those guys over

48
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,659
to our side, this will totally

49
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,994
swing the game.

50
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:18,953
>> PROBST: Go!

51
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,747
At the immunity challenge, Terry

52
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,123
won individual immunity for the

53
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,042
second time in a row.

54
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,126
Terry wins immunity!

55
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,837
Back at camp, Terry and Austin

56
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,672
immediately cornered Bruce to

57
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,173
try to get him to flip.

58
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,008
>> They're concocting their

59
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:32,884
plan.

60
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,510
You're not part of it, Bruce.

61
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,220
Your only chance is with us.

62
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,181
>> If I'm at the bottom of the

63
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,140
Casaya pecking order, then

64
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,100
everything's up for grabs.

65
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,268
>> Hold on. Let me get in the

66
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:42,519
middle.

67
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,228
>> PROBST: Then Austin and Terry

68
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,271
made a bold promise to Danielle.

69
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,153
>> It's tempting that I could

70
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,489
actually transform this game

71
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,324
into a whole new thing.

72
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,492
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

73
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,159
Council, Danielle and Bruce stay

74
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,620
true to their alliance.

75
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,955
Terry kept his hidden immunity

76
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:02,664
idol.

77
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,040
The eighth person voted out of

78
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:05,458
<i>Survivor: Exile Island,</i> the

79
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,918
first member of our jury.

80
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,670
And Austin was voted out.

81
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,422
Austin, the tribe has spoken.

82
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,423
Eight are left.

83
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,177
Who will be voted out tonight?

84
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,178
Captioning sponsored by

85
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,179
CBS PARAMOUNT

86
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:22,934
NETWORK TELEVISION

87
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,915
>> And you're at four years at

88
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,041
which university?

89
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,793
>> First, flight school for Navy

90
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,253
is Pensacola.

91
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,921
Then I went to jet training in

92
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,964
Meridian, Mississippi where you

93
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:53,506
learn to dogfight and drop

94
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,884
bombs and shoot guns and land on

95
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,135
the carrier.

96
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,469
And then you get your wings from

97
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,262
there.

98
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,305
And then from there you go to,

99
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,682
you know, say, Jacksonville for

100
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,684
A-7s or F-18s, Whidbey Island

101
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,895
for...

102
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,146
>> He's a retired Naval pilot?

103
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,480
>> And I'm already behind the

104
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,149
curve and he slaps nine Gs on

105
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,610
our way. (grunts) Wham!

106
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,903
And my head just goes up

107
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,612
against the canopy...

108
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,946
>> How is any normal American

109
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,907
person supposed to beat a Navy

110
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,325
air fighter pilot dude?

111
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,660
>> Maybe he'll break his arm or

112
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,745
something.

113
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,621
>> (chuckles): God forbid.

114
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,122
>> Oh, my God, I can't believe

115
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,123
you just said that.

116
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,125
>> I know. I'm sorry.

117
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,335
>> All right, guys, here's the

118
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,254
question.

119
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,255
>> That's not in our plan.

120
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,381
>> That's not part of the plan,

121
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,341
Terry.

122
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,300
>> All right, then I'm just

123
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,469
gonna have to take you to the

124
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:39,886
bank the whole time.

125
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,471
>> If you do that, man, hats

126
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,514
off.

127
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,061
>> Tribal Council last night was

128
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,187
kind of a bummer.

129
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,480
Austin went home; that was the

130
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,441
end result, but prior to that,

131
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,068
there was a big swing play to

132
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:55,652
try to get Danielle to come

133
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,738
over by offering her the hidden

134
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,574
immunity idol, and, uh, she

135
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,660
declined.

136
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,584
>> Mm-hmm.

137
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,962
>> So now Sally and I are pretty

138
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,089
much on our own, so my mindset

139
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,799
is, I am totally motivated to

140
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,925
kick their butts at everything

141
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,969
that comes down the road.

142
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,518
>> Where's his bag?

143
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,312
>> I want to see it.

144
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,523
Is it something fuzzy?

145
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,115
>> Before Austin went home,

146
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,242
Terry showed me some sort of

147
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,785
hidden immunity idol.

148
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,578
I mean, it was something furry.

149
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,496
I mean, he could be making this

150
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,999
up and he could have just, I

151
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:51,624
don't know, found, I guess, this

152
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,377
furry thing out in the woods and

153
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,837
could be showing it to me

154
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,963
pretending like it's the hidden

155
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:57,463
idol, but I don't know.

156
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,799
You have to be careful who you

157
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,842
assume has it.

158
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,426
>> I just had a nice long talk

159
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,720
with Terry about his time in the

160
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,429
Navy.

161
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,471
>> I mean, it's, like, it's

162
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,764
pretty cool that we're going up

163
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,640
against that guy.

164
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,058
>> (sarcastic): Yeah, really

165
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,268
cool.

166
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:10,852
>> We're gonna take him out.

167
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,437
>> All right.

168
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,354
>> He flies planes.

169
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,272
He's not...

170
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,606
>> Yeah, but he went to the

171
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,399
Naval Academy, dude.

172
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,442
>> He's not an American

173
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,609
Gladiator, you know?

174
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,777
>> This reward challenge, if any

175
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,195
of you guys win it and don't

176
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,363
take me, send my ass to Exile

177
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:22,572
Island.

178
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,408
>> Sure you want to go?

179
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,913
>> I don't know if someone's

180
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,081
found the hidden immunity idol,

181
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,666
and I want to go figure that out

182
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,500
for myself because I'm

183
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,669
absolutely a target going into

184
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,255
these next Tribal Councils, and

185
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,548
I want to be there on that

186
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,508
island scouring it and see

187
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,677
what I can find.

188
00:05:55,271 --> 00:06:02,487
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

189
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,905
How's everybody doing?

190
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:04,864
>> Great.

191
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,032
>> Marvelous.

192
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,033
>> PROBST: Today I'm gonna tell

193
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,076
you what you're playing for

194
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,327
before I tell you about the

195
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:09,619
challenge.

196
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,038
It's been 22 days since you have

197
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:12,622
seen or heard from anyone back

198
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,457
home.

199
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,458
>> Oh, no.

200
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:15,958
>> PROBST: And that's long

201
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,168
enough.

202
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,461
So to whet your appetite for

203
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,670
today's challenge, I'm gonna

204
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,297
give you just a little taste of

205
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,632
love from home.

206
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,841
Follow me.

207
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,969
>> Oh, no.

208
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,476
>> PROBST: Have a seat.

209
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,269
Well, it would be great if they

210
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,604
were here in the flesh.

211
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,480
They're not, but they did send

212
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,149
some videos from home that will

213
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,110
hopefully fill your heart a

214
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,612
little bit.

215
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,280
This is just a taste of what's

216
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,990
on your video.

217
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:48,825
Win today's reward challenge,

218
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,492
and you get to watch the whole

219
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,786
thing.

220
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,121
Terry, this is your wife Trish,

221
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,247
your son Danny...

222
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,373
>> Yeah.

223
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:55,957
>> PROBST: ...your daughter

224
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,541
Kayla and your dog Riley.

225
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,668
>> Riley.

226
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,253
>> You've been gone for a long

227
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,420
time now.

228
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,339
It seems like forever.

229
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,258
>> Daddy, I really miss you, and

230
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,801
I want you to come home.

231
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,177
I hope you're doing good.

232
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,762
Outwit, outplay, outlast.

233
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,264
I really miss you.

234
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,140
(clapping)

235
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,475
>> That was awesome.

236
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,060
>> PROBST: Danielle, here's your

237
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:16,936
whole family.

238
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,188
>> Oh, geez.

239
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,064
>> Hi, Danielle.

240
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,607
I miss you, and I can't wait to

241
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,775
see you.

242
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,068
It's not the same around here

243
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,278
without you here bothering me.

244
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:25,862
>> We love you very much and

245
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,530
very, very proud of everything

246
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,116
you're doing.

247
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,117
>> PROBST: Bruce, here's your

248
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,702
family.

249
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,036
You've got your wife Nancy, your

250
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,413
daughter Danielle, and I think

251
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:35,746
there's a dog.

252
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,497
>> Chaco.

253
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,916
>> PROBST: Chaco.

254
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,542
>> Chaco, where's Bruce?

255
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,501
>> Where's Dad?

256
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,753
(barks)

257
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,754
>> Oh. Oh, oh.

258
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,714
Ah.

259
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,966
She misses you.

260
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:47,675
Yeah, she's a good watchdog, but

261
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,802
she's not like having the real

262
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,845
guy here.

263
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,013
>> PROBST: How long you been

264
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,055
married?

265
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,098
>> Almost 28 years.

266
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,016
>> PROBST: 28 years.

267
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,309
>> Yeah. I'm more in love with

268
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,602
her than when I first met her.

269
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,686
>> PROBST: How do you think

270
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,770
she's doing back home without

271
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,938
you around?

272
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,356
>> I'm sure she misses my

273
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,899
snoring, so she can't sleep

274
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,692
well.

275
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,860
(laughter)

276
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,278
>> PROBST: Courtney, here's

277
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,030
your mom Barbara.

278
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,448
>> Sweetheart, you just have to

279
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,073
know that we are thinking about

280
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,159
you every single day.

281
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:13,743
We've got the candles going,

282
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,037
we've got the fountain going,

283
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,663
we've got the love signs going,

284
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,457
and we've got the prayers going.

285
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,416
We love you very much.

286
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:20,708
Bye, hon.

287
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,877
>> This is our love sign, like,

288
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,128
in our family.

289
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:24,754
That's my mom's, and this is my

290
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,881
dad, and this is my sister's.

291
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,257
And, like, so our whole family

292
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:28,841
has these love signs, and it's

293
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,759
really great.

294
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,969
(laughs)

295
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,304
>> PROBST: Aras, this is your

296
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:33,638
dad.

297
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,723
>> Hey, Aras.

298
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,807
(laughter)

299
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,059
Long time no see.

300
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,393
Remember when you used to do

301
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,353
this?

302
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:40,937
Anyways, come in with tepee.

303
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,980
I have something I want to tell

304
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,274
ya.

305
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:45,816
>> PROBST: The tepee in your

306
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,692
backyard?

307
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,568
What's that about?

308
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,611
>> My dad's always wanted a

309
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,655
tepee, and five years ago, his

310
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,240
sister bought one for him, so we

311
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,533
just have fires out there, and

312
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:53,950
we'll sit and talk.

313
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:54,617
>> PROBST: Sounds like you have

314
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,785
a strong connection with your

315
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,578
dad.

316
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,247
>> I do, so it's really nice to

317
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,206
see.

318
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,249
>> PROBST: All right, Shane,

319
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,917
safe to say the love of your

320
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,252
life, your son Boston?

321
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:04,877
>> (voice breaking): Not even a

322
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,545
question.

323
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,004
>> Hey, Dad, it's me.

324
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,215
I love you so much, and I know

325
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,258
that you're doing fine out

326
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,509
there.

327
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:11,884
Say hi to Loki.

328
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:16,430
(Shane sobbing)

329
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,515
>> PROBST: What are you feeling

330
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,391
now?

331
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,600
Are you wishing you were home?

332
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,977
Are you feeling good 'cause you

333
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,852
saw him?

334
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,812
>> We grew up together.

335
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,604
You know, I was 21 when I had

336
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,398
him.

337
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,941
He is my other half, he is my

338
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:27,817
brother, he is my best friend,

339
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,280
he is my son, he is my life.

340
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:32,822
>> PROBST: All right, Sally,

341
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,533
here's your mom, dad, you sister

342
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,617
and even your dog Darby.

343
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,660
>> Hi, Sal.

344
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,287
We're all sitting here in my new

345
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,913
place that I can't wait for you

346
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,206
to see.

347
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,624
We're all rooting for you, and

348
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,167
we all miss you very much.

349
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,460
We love you!

350
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,253
>> Love you, Sal.

351
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,504
I love you, Sal.

352
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,922
>> PROBST: So your sister got a

353
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,048
new apartment since you've been

354
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:51,716
gone?

355
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,759
>> Apparently.

356
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,802
>> PROBST: All right, so

357
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,220
everybody's had a taste...

358
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,346
Aw.

359
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,848
(laughter)

360
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,350
I couldn't forget you, Cirie.

361
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,560
Here's your son Jared and

362
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,728
Jamil and your husband H.B.

363
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,854
>> Mm-hmm.

364
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,815
Oh, my God.

365
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,734
>> Hey, Mom.

366
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,776
>> Hey, honey bunny.

367
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,195
We missed you a lot, honey.

368
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,864
>> Yes...

369
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,866
>> Yes. It ain't the same

370
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,409
without you being around here.

371
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,910
We miss your laugh, your smile,

372
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,787
just everything.

373
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,664
>> PROBST: Does that make you

374
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,207
wish you were home, or are you

375
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,417
just feeling better now that

376
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,418
you've seen them?

377
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,044
>> I'm happy that I saw... saw

378
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,714
them, but it makes it harder for

379
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,757
me here.

380
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,425
(Cirie sniffles and sighs)

381
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,885
But all of this is for them,

382
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,802
so...

383
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,095

challenge, you get to see the

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,806
rest of your video, and you'll

386
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,558
enjoy something else that will

387
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,684
make you think of home-- peanut

388
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,769
butter and jelly sandwiches...

389
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,770
>> Oh!

390
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,771

391
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,772
>> Ah!

392
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,397

393
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:48,898

394
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:49,774
>> Yes!

395
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,567
>> Yeah!

396
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,443
>> PROBST: All right, you're

397
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,069
going to divide into two teams

398
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,904
of four, and you will most

399
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,113
definitely have to work together

400
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:56,697
to win this.

401
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,367
One person will lie face-down

402
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,993
on a cradle that is suspended in

403
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,869
the air by bungee cords.

404
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,704
Attached to that cradle are

405
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,789
three ropes.

406
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,873
The other three people on your

407
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,792
team will pull those ropes to

408
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,877
maneuver the person on the

409
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,796
cradle as they grab 15 flags and

410
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,632
place them in order, one at a

411
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,217
time, in their appropriate

412
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,218
slots.

413
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,095
First tribe to get all 15 in

414
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
order wins reward.

415
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:21,931
In addition, the winning team of

416
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,517
four decides who goes to Exile

417
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,518
Island.

418
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,644
All right, we're going to

419
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,853
randomly divide into two even

420
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,896

421
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,692
Let's go.

422
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,027
Okay, in the white cradle, we

423
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:35,820

Here we go.

429

For reward.

430
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,749
Survivors ready?

431
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,793
Go!

00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,715
>> Keep it tight!

572
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:42,965
(laughs)

573
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,342
I can't get it!

574
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,719
>> Courtney, it's right here.

575
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,847
>> Pull me down more!

576
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,390
>> PROBST: Terry, Sally, Bruce,

577
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,017
Courtney have one flag left.

578
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,226
(Bruce grunting)

579
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,102
>> Come on!

580
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,103
>> Take the... Take your time!

581
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,271
Take your time!

582
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,814
>> Swing me, swing me!

583
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,191
(grunting)

584
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,526
>> PROBST: Loved one's video,

585
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,444
peanut butter and jelly

586
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,113
sandwiches, ice cold milk.

587
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,281
>> Yeah!

588
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,699
>> PROBST: Reward for Courtney,

589
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,034
Terry, Bruce and Sally!

590
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,161
>> Yes!

591
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,163
Again, the factor!

592
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,165
>> Damn.

593
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,376
>> Oh.

594
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,381
>> PROBST: Okay, before we get

595
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,924
to the rest of the your reward,

596
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:26,258
big decision.

597
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,092
You're sending one person to

598
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,845
Exile Island.

599
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:30,387
Is it going to be Danielle,

600
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,265
Aras, Cirie or Shane?

601
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,811
>> Okay.

602
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,729
>> PROBST: Who's it going to be?

603
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,563
>> Aras.

604
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,856
>> PROBST: Aras, get your stuff.

605
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,566
The boat's coming to pick you

606
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,567
up.

607
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,362
>> Bye, Aras.

608
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,613
>> PROBST: Shane, Cirie,

609
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,031
Danielle, I'm genuinely sorry

610
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,532
that the rest of the afternoon

611
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,450
doesn't include you.

612
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,743
Grab your stuff, head back to

613
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,577
camp.

614
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,453
>> Enjoy your families, guys.

615
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,537
>> See you.

616
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,247
>> Thoughts with you guys.

617
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,290
>> PROBST: Okay, now comes the

618
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,458
fun-- videos and peanut butter

619
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,417
and jelly.

620
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,754
Let's go.

621
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,175
(indistinct chatter)

622
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,025
(laughter)

623
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,110
>> You know what I mean?

624
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,236
So, let's just...

625
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,612
If you're going to lose one,

626
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,446
let's lose this one.

627
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,572
The tapes would have wrecked

628
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,448
us, dude.

629
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,741
>> I know.

630
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,909
>> Shane and Danielle and

631
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:34,410
myself returned to camp.

632
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,161
Shane kind of said this wasn't

633
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,663
like the hugest challenge to

634
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,164
lose, but he was just trying to,

635
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,793
uh, kind of lift our spirits.

636
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,671
Yay! Home!

637
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,755
>> I have an issue with my

638
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,673
penis.

639
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,757
(Cirie laughs)

640
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,675
I'm so sorry.

641
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,592
>> Then, Shane had a medical

642
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,468
emergency.

643
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,302
(Cirie laughs)

644
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,178
>> Oh, something's really going

645
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:53,345
on.

646
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,013
I need you to look at it real

647
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:55,848
quick.

648
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:56,598
>> (laughing): I don't want to

649
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,391
look at it.

650
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,434
>> You're a nurse!

651
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,477
>> I know.

652
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,189
>> Can you explain it to me, or

653
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,191
do I have to look at it?

654
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,069
>> Shane has this funky thing

655
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,780
going on with his, uh,

656
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,284
testicles, to put it nicely.

657
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,953
Lucky me, being the only nurse

658
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,872
out here, he wanted me to take a

659
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,247
look at 'em.

660
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,708
(Cirie laughs)

661
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,293
Yay!

662
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:24,752
>> Don't be laughing.

663
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,210
>> All right.

664
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,004
>> Hey, don't laugh.

665
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:27,880
It's a... not a...

666
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:28,964
Here.

667
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,923
(Cirie laughs)

668
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,967
>> What?!

669
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:36,930
>> That's because it's wet all

670
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:37,806
the time.

671
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,057
Your clothes are moist.

672
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,058
It's like chafing.

673
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,518
You know, like diaper rash on a

674
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,478
baby?

675
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,605
>> Yeah. That's what that is?

676
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,148
>> I tried to be as professional

677
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,816
as I could under the

678
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,610
circumstances, but it was just

679
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,403
so hilarious.

680
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,571
(Cirie laughing)

681
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,489
>> Is that because I've been

682
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,531
wearing those undies for 23

683
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,365
days?

684
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,200
>> It's a good guess, Shane.

685
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,994
>> How do I make that go away?

686
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:02,456
>> Can you dry it out?

687
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,373
>> What's wrong with him?

688
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,292
>> Just like a little red, and

689
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,543
then he's naked.

690
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,211
Oh, my God.

691
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,922
>> Yo.

692
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:10,964
I'm eating.

693
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:11,965
(Cirie sighs)

694
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,300
>> Can I do a skirt glove?

695
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,218
>> No. Do your shirt.

696
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,260
Do your shirt.

697
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,345
>> I guess.

698
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,722
>> Shane is like a cartoon

699
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,348
character, and now he's like a

700
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,642
nude cartoon character, but that

701
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,769
helped me so much, because I

702
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,394
kind of forgot about what I was

703
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,270
missing.

704
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,188
>> Ladies, it's my chafing

705
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,147
skirt.

706
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,192
>> Okay.

707
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,237
(bird singing)

708
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,911
>> There's two reasons I'm

709
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,995
really happy to be out here.

710
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,621
One, I get to spend some time by

711
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,206
myself and really step away from

712
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,165
the game.

713
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,919
And, two, I get a chance to look

714
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,128
for the immunity idol.

715
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,381
Immunity is very important, and

716
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,590
the hidden immunity idol is,

717
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,758
obviously, clearly, very

718
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,094
important, but I just can't seem

719
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,011
to wrap my mind around these

720
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,056
clues.

721
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,356
One of the problems with the

722
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,024
clue is that it says it's under

723
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,025
a rock.

724
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:12,609
People have moved rocks, so, I

725
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,278
don't know if I'm digging a hole

726
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,488
where there is nothing to dig,

727
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,448
or I don't know what's going on.

728
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,283
I'm sure a lot of that just has

729
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,577
to do with mental fatigue of

730
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,121
being out here for days.

731
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,501
>> Terry is the person I fear

732
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,544
may have the idol.

733
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,296
It would be a real easy move on

734
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,422
his part to just send me out

735
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,133
here, knowing I'm his biggest

736
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,926
physical competitor, and that,

737
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,468
you know, it might weaken me

738
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,512
physically to be out here.

739
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,847
So his quickness to send me

740
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,140
might suggest that there is no

741
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,266
immunity idol out here, so

742
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,601
there's no sense in me looking

743
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,145
for it.

744
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,529
>> Yo, they're home.

745
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,280
>> Are we...?

746
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,201
>> Boo, boo, boo.

747
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,369
When Sally and the other team

748
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,413
that won-- when they came back,

749
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,623
I didn't even want to see them.

750
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,291
I was just kind of like already

751
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,667
aggravated that we lost, and the

752
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,377
last thing I want to know is how

753
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,046
full their bellies are, and how

754
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,130
great it was to see their

755
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,214
families.

756
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,007
>> Oh, you guys got your luxury

757
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,008
items, too?

758
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,635
>> Yeah.

759
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,510
>> Hey.

760
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,553
>> You always want to learn how

761
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,349
to swing a shovel.

762
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,266
>> You guys get to learn our

763
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,685
fire dance.

764
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,104
>> And then, you know, when they

765
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:31,730
walked back in, and they all had

766
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,314
their luxury items, I'm, like,

767
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,399
oh, wow, you know, that's a

768
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,443
double whammy.

769
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,862
>> It's all right, honey.

770
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,529
You can't...

771
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:39,863
You guys won.

772
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,198
You know what I mean?

773
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:41,490
>> I know.

774
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,282
>> You need help, Terry?

775
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,492
>> After the food for the soul

776
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,953
and the heart with the videos

777
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,788
came luxury items for us four

778
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,830
members.

779
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,873
It was great.

780
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,291
Just kind of hook this in for

781
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:51,500
now.

782
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,459
(Bruce mumbles)

783
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,461
Thank you for asking me.

784
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,629
Both my father-in-law and my

785
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,380
father were Korean war vets,

786
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,132
and, uh... and they recently

787
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,635
passed away, and this was on my

788
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,178
father-in-law's casket.

789
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,805
So in order to honor both my

790
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,347
father and my father-in-law,

791
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,642
going to hang here at, uh,

792
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,102
Gitanos for a while, and, uh,

793
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,353
hopefully till day 39.

794
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,814
>> What did you guys, what did

795
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,982
you bring?

796
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,024
Love it!

797
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:16,984
>> Sally brought her journal,

798
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:17,526
Bruce has a sketchbook, and

799
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,403
Terry has the American flag, go

800
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,445
figure.

801
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,488
But I thought Courtney's luxury

802
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,449
items were like the coolest.

803
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:29,538
(Courtney laughing)

804
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,330
>> It makes me so happy, you

805
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,331
know.

806
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,250
It's a toy for everyone.

807
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,167
It's really fun.

808
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,961
This is, like, my-my joy.

809
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,170
>> But it's hard when you're

810
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,381
the loser, and everybody is

811
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,008
like (laughing): "I got this!

812
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,551
And look what I...!"

813
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,468
Who cares?

814
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,595
You know, you want to say, "Who

815
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,471
cares?

816
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,056
Get out of here," but you can't.

817
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,516
It's a game, so you have to

818
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,643
kind of keep it together.

819
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,786
(birds screeching)

820
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,842
>> Then it's up to you to

821
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,594
either get Courtney, Danielle,

822
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,096
or Cirie to come over and one

823
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,638
of us would have to win the

824
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,514
next challenge.

825
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,475
That way we could share the

826
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,476
hidden immunity idol, and we

827
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,895
would have numbers.

828
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:35,479
>> There are currently six

829
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:39,149
ex-Casaya members that are

830
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,609
staying loyal and true to each

831
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,943
other, versus Terry and I, the

832
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,320
two ex-La Mina members who are

833
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:47,115
left.

834
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,076
Like, what if we said to, like,

835
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:49,701
Danielle or Courtney or whoever,

836
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,329
say, like, you or I won the next

837
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,581
immunity, and we said, we're

838
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,041
going to play that thing

839
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,043
tonight, so you better jump on

840
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:58,627
now.

841
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,920
>> You know, we could play the

842
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,004
hidden immunity idol, and we

843
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,631
could, you know, one of us will

844
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:02,923
be immune.

845
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,592
So one of you are going home.

846
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,178
>> If Terry or I win immunity

847
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,472
today, and Terry decides that

848
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,765
he wants to play the hidden

849
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,016
immunity idol, one of the other

850
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,976
six ex-Casaya members will go

851
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,602
home tonight.

852
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,813
Because the immunity idol can

853
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,439
be used after the vote is made,

854
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,066
which means we would all have to

855
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,734
show our cards and then the next

856
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,486
person who has the most votes

857
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,238
would get kicked off, and so I

858
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,281
have a lot of hope that things

859
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,908
could change today in this game.

860
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,617
>> What do we have to do other

861
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,619
than beat you at immunity?

862
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,621
Do you know of anything?

863
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,039
>> I don't know, you better not

864
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,124
think about anything else.

865
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,416
>> How about this: if you don't

866
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,168
win immunity, and you don't

867
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,545
have that silly idol from that

868
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,131
goofy island, you're gone.

869
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:54,516
>> Yeah, well, you never know.

870
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,853
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

871
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,650
Hello.

872
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,777
>> Good morning.

873
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,945
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

874
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:07,988
Aras, returning from Exile

875
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,323
Island.

876
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,118
>> Morning, beast.

877
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:13,535
>> Hey.

878
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,536
>> What's up, fellas?

879
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,830
(applause)

880
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,373
>> A day and a half of

881
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,624
meditation never hurt nobody.

882
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,917
>> Brucey.

883
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:21,835
>> PROBST: Aras, two days out

884
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,586
there.

885
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,753
How was it?

886
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,921
>> It was surprisingly nice.

887
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,381
I made fire, like, the first

888
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,340
three minutes.

889
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,717
I ate a lot, I hydrated myself

890
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,093
really well.

891
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:30,719
I got a little time for myself

892
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,888
and a little time to look for

893
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,972
the idol.

894
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,056
>> PROBST: So overall, Exile

895
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,308
Island was not that bad?

896
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,226
>> No, but I don't know if I'd

897
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,727
want to go right back.

898
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,520
>> PROBST: All right, before we

899
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,563
get to the challenge, I'm going

900
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,440
to hand each of you a nut and a

901
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,652
shell.

902
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,862
Without conferring with anybody,

903
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,989
put the shell in one hand, put

904
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,617
the nut in the other hand.

905
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,701
I'll explain how these come

906
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,621
into play in a minute.

907
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,663
And I'll take the immunity

908
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,624
necklace from you.

909
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,043
Immunity, once again back up

910
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:03,877
for grabs.

911
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,378
For today's challenge, this is

912
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,755
how it works: sitting on the

913
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,132
ocean floor is a long plank

914
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,592
with seven symbols on it.

915
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,718
On my "go," you're going to

916
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,428
swim out, memorize as many of

917
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,638
those symbols, in order, as you

918
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,431
can, then race back to the

919
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,099
beach where you will attempt to

920
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,185
replicate those symbols in the

921
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,354
same order on your answer board.

922
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:22,938
The first person to solves it

923
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,232
correctly, wins immunity,

924
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,733
guaranteed a one in seven shot

925
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,569
at $1 million.

926
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,154
Losers, Tribal Council tonight,

927
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,489
and for one of you, this game

928
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,782
will come to an end.

929
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,533
Now, there's a twist to today's

930
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,869
challenge: if immunity is just

931
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,038
not that important to you, you

932
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,623
don't have to take part in

933
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:41,998
today's challenge.

934
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,628
Instead, you can chow down...

935
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,964
>> Oh!

936
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:49,631
>> PROBST: ...on cheeseburgers,

937
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,341
French fries...

938
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,384
>> Me.

939
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:52,968
>> PROBST: ...and soft drinks.

940
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,803
You can eat for as long as the

941
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,180
challenge goes, or until the

942
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,473
food runs out.

943
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,141
Put the shell in one hand, put

944
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:00,642
the nut in the other hand.

945
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,644
When I tell you to reveal if

946
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,688
you want to take part in the

947
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,815
challenge, you will show me the

948
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,691
shell.

949
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,942
If instead you want to eat

950
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,361
food, you'll show me the nut.

951
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,612
Three, two, one, reveal.

952
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,614
Okay, Aras is going to take

953
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,866
part in the challenge.

954
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,326
Sally is taking part in the

955
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,369
challenge.

956
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:19,953
Terry is taking part in the

957
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,997
challenge.

958
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,040
Bruce, Cirie, Courtney, Shane,

959
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:24,791
and Danielle are all saying, "I

960
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,876
don't need immunity.

961
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,128
I'm going to eat."

962
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:28,712
You five take a spot on the

963
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,713
picnic table.

964
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,257
The other three, down here at

965
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,674
the answer booth.

966
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,386
>> Aras, it's all you.

967
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,763
>> Yeah.

968
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,890
>> PROBST: All right, it's Terry

969
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:41,641
Aras, and Sally fighting for

970
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,685
immunity while Shane, Danielle,

971
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,980
Courtney, Cirie, and Bruce chow

972
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,149
down and enjoy the show.

973
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:53,862
Survivors, ready?

974
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,532
Go!

975
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,909
Got to swim out, memorize the

976
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,911
symbols in order.

977
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,121
Shane digging in, Danielle

978
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:03,913
digging in.

979
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,665
Cirie already got a bite.

980
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,791
Bruce not waste any time.

981
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,877
We have two challenges going on.

982
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,670
How much food can you get down

983
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,797
before somebody wins immunity?

984
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,758
Terry going down.

985
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:20,221
Aras taking a dip to look.

986
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:24,059
Sally taking a dip to look.

987
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,518
A lot of French fries, a lot of

988
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,563
cheeseburgers.

989
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,948
Terry thinks he has it

990
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:39,824
memorized.

991
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,241
He's coming back.

992
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,368
>> Oh, no.

993
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,244
>> PROBST: Aras heading back.

994
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,289
Sally still working on it.

995
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,293
Five very secure people chowing

996
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,003
down.

997
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,713
Terry first back.

998
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,964
He's going to give a go.

999
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,299
Aras right behind him.

1000
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:00,178
Sally heading back.

1001
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,471
You're looking to get all seven

1002
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,766
symbols in the same order.

1003
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,226
>> Go, Sally!

1004
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,268
>> PROBST: Sally making her way

1005
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,313
back.

1006
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:14,818
Sally trying to work hers out

1007
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:20,782
up top before she commits.

1008
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,493
>> Take your time, guys.

1009
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,828
>> PROBST: Who's on their second

1010
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,745
burger?

1011
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,372
Shane and Cirie.

1012
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,291
Bruce on his second burger.

1013
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,129
Terry working it out.

1014
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:43,263
Immunity on the line.

1015
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,472
No.

1016
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,433
Aras doesn't have it.

1017
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,642
Aras swimming back out for

1018
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:47,976
another look.

1019
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,727
>> Here you go.

1020
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,353
>> PROBST: Terry thinks he has

1021
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,646
it.

1022
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:58,236
>> Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

1023
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,154
>> PROBST: Terry wins immunity

1024
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,363
for the third straight time!

1025
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:00,947
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1026
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,616
Yes...!

1027
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,784
Yes!

1028
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,285
>> PROBST: Stop eating.

1029
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:05,994
Put it down.

1030
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,955
Put it down, guys.

1031
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,803
Terry, come on over.

1032
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,348
For the third straight time,

1033
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,725
individual immunity.

1034
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,350
You're safe at Tribal Council.

1035
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,060
With this around your neck, you

1036
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,187
cannot be voted out.

1037
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,480
For the other seven of you,

1038
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,732
after 24 days, tonight, this

1039
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,484
game will come to an end for one

1040
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,860
of you.

1041
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,903
Head on back to camp.

1042
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,947
See you at Tribal.

1043
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:03,927
(laughing quietly)

1044
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,094
>> Did you get the clue?

1045
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,262
>> Yeah, I got the clue.

1046
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,347
But it's hard to find.

1047
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,431
>> Oh, really?

1048
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,432
>> No, no, there are two

1049
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,099
choices.

1050
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,726
Either it was really easy to

1051
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,312
find and he got it right away.

1052
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:14,896
>> Oh, right.

1053
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,105
>> Or... or no one's got it.

1054
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,065
>> So, we vote Sally, 6-0

1055
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,317
tonight...

1056
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,318
>> Okay.

1057
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,569
>> ...and hope to God he

1058
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,570
doesn't have it?

1059
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,071
>> Yeah.

1060
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,698
Thanks for standing up for

1061
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,491
Casaya.

1062
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,784
>> I should have won it.

1063
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,244
Today's immunity challenge,

1064
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,328
anybody who wanted to not

1065
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,287
participate in the challenge

1066
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,413
could sit and have

1067
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,415
cheeseburgers.

1068
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:34,999
There was no question what I

1069
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,377
was going to do, because it's

1070
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,836
very possible that I could go

1071
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,589
home today.

1072
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,091
If Sally ends up having the

1073
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,217
hidden immunity idol, then

1074
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,885
Sally and Terry's vote will

1075
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,179
knock somebody out.

1076
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,202
>> I think Terry just showed

1077
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,037
the hidden immunity idol.

1078
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,456
Until this moment, I really was

1079
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,083
kind of questionable about him

1080
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,544
having the immunity idol, but I

1081
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,712
believe that is the immunity

1082
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,298
idol, and I'm looking forward

1083
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,466
to seeing what happens tonight.

1084
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,677
>> Tonight... if two of you

1085
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,514
said we will vote with you...

1086
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,516
>> Aras.

1087
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,142
>> If two of us would vote with

1088
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,059
you guys...

1089
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,353
>> The goal was to get two

1090
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,105
people, so it would be Terry,

1091
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,315
myself, and two others.

1092
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,691
It'd be four against four, we'd

1093
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,568
have the idol, we'd play it, and

1094
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,153
what he wants to see happen is

1095
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,447
us break up 'cause it's going to

1096
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,073
happen anyway, so he's like,

1097
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,617
"Why don't a couple of you want

1098
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,076
to guarantee yourself a spot in

1099
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,579
the final four?"

1100
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,122
I'm giving everybody in camp the

1101
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,248
impression that the hidden

1102
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,541
immunity idol will be played

1103
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,917
tonight.

1104
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,169
Terry may decide that it isn't

1105
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:01,961
worth giving up the idol at this

1106
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,631
point, but it's most

1107
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,299
advantageous for us to break up

1108
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,925
this strong six as soon as

1109
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,594
possible and watch them unravel

1110
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,138
and watch them scurry a bit.

1111
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,767
Otherwise, I'm gone.

1112
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,768
>> You're saying that you're

1113
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,852
giving your immunity idol to

1114
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:18,853
Sally?

1115
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,271
>> I'm not saying I have it.

1116
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,731
I'm just saying it's out there

1117
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,024
and it could be put in play

1118
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,443
tonight, and what I am proposing

1119
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,153
is getting Bruce on our side and

1120
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,947
then get somebody else like you

1121
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,240
to come over and make it a

1122
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,951
guaranteed four and then we'll

1123
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,079
vote the four votes for Aras and

1124
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,664
then he'll be gone.

1125
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,247
>> I can't-- I can't commit to

1126
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,165
this at this moment.

1127
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,334
>> Okay.

1128
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,126
Guaranteed final four.

1129
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,170
>> I would like to align with

1130
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,463
Terry because I really want to

1131
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,047
go up against him in the final

1132
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,006
two.

1133
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,050
If, further down the line, we

1134
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,051
can make a deal...

1135
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,094
>> It's got to be tonight.

1136
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,387
It's got to be tonight with

1137
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,889
Sally.

1138
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,307
>> If we do remove Aras, then no

1139
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,934
one will be able to beat Terry,

1140
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,560
but then on the other point,

1141
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,144
Aras is more of a threat than

1142
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,188
Terry because he'd be much

1143
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,066
harder to beat in the final two.

1144
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,651
There's no clear-cut way for me

1145
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,652
to go right now.

1146
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,612
I'm really-- I'm still kind of

1147
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,614
confused in my mind.

1148
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,198
>> Terry, he's trying to win

1149
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,033
every immunity challenge.

1150
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,868
You mean to tell me you have an

1151
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,161
ace in the hole and you're gonna

1152
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,413
just hand that over, because

1153
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,206
you're such a nice person, to

1154
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,374
somebody else?

1155
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,418
Come on, give me a break.

1156
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,127
I mean, I'll be surprised.

1157
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,213
He may do it and if he does,

1158
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,840
that will go down as the worst

1159
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,550
move in<i> Survivor</i> history because

1160
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,343
then he<i> has</i> to win every single

1161
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,344
challenge.

1162
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,804
But, hey, I've seen crazier

1163
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,389
things happen, so we'll see

1164
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:40,977
tonight.

1165
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,103
>> This is our fire, our life,

1166
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,148
our journey together.

1167
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,108
We're so blessed.

1168
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,109
>> No answer?

1169
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,069
>> No answer.

1170
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,155
She's into her fire thing, but

1171
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,614
she can't make a decision and

1172
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,199
I'm like, "Make a freaking

1173
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,701
decision."

1174
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,285
If Courtney does not sway

1175
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,621
tonight, I may or may not give

1176
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,290
the immunity idol to Sally.

1177
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,082
If it has to come into play, it

1178
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,084
will.

1179
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,378
I feel a little bit of risk

1180
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,464
hanging it out there, but if I

1181
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,548
come away tonight with the

1182
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,175
numbers, then I can sit back and

1183
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,259
don't have to win another

1184
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,260
immunity challenge until the

1185
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,221
final three.

1186
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,036
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1187
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,497
the first member of our jury--

1188
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,122
Austin, voted out at the last

1189
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,332
Tribal Council.

1190
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,335
(laughter)

1191
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:52,131
>> Wow.

1192
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,466
>> PROBST: Okay, today's

1193
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,592
immunity challenge.

1194
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,885
You were given a very simple

1195
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,137
option-- participate or feast--

1196
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,514
and no sooner did I get

1197
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,807
"cheeseburger" out of my mouth,

1198
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,432
five of you guys are like, "I'm

1199
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,351
eating, I'm eating, I'm eating."

1200
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,062
Shane, worried at all that that

1201
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,396
bold of a move could come back

1202
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,648
to haunt you?

1203
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,982
>> First of all, I just would

1204
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:10,608
like to say I over-performed at

1205
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,317
the challenge today.

1206
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,861
I got almost two cheeseburgers

1207
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,487
down with nine fries and almost

1208
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,322
an entire glass of Coke, but

1209
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,198
there was a part of me that

1210
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,157
regretted doing that.

1211
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,952
There was part of me that felt

1212
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,453
like I, for the team, needed to

1213
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,413
show up and try to get immunity

1214
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,998
away from Terry because it's

1215
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,375
going to be very difficult, but

1216
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,209
I also know that I don't feel

1217
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,253
in my gut of guts that I needed

1218
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,214
to get immunity today, and I

1219
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,549
was-- I'm starving.

1220
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,467
>> PROBST: Sally, got to be a

1221
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,552
little frustrating because...

1222
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,220
>> It's<i> so</i> frustrating.

1223
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,888
I mean, the people who are

1224
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,849
confident in this game get to be

1225
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,809
confident and, you know what, if

1226
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,185
they're secure in that, more

1227
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,186
power to them.

1228
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,771
I mean, I didn't for one second

1229
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,772
consider eating that

1230
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,231
cheeseburger today.

1231
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,234
It was the easiest meal that I

1232
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,902
have had to pass up out here

1233
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,029
just because I needed that

1234
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,030
immunity today.

1235
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,240
>> PROBST: Aras, you had to feel

1236
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,659
a little irritated that the

1237
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,578
responsibility to win it for

1238
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,997
Casaya came down to one guy.

1239
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,581
>> Yeah, that was a little bit

1240
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,499
disappointing of the Casaya

1241
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,334
folk, whose heads could possibly

1242
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,919
be on the chopping block if a

1243
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,004
hidden immunity idol gets

1244
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,088
played.

1245
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,298
My head is definitely one of

1246
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,966
those, but more so than that,

1247
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:17,967
it's a strategy.

1248
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,260
The quicker that we can get

1249
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,137
Terry's immunity necklace,

1250
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,762
which-- I call it Terry's 'cause

1251
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,347
he's the only one who's worn it

1252
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,224
so far-- off of his neck, the

1253
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,767
quicker that we can get into our

1254
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,894
strategy.

1255
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,021
We didn't, it's over, and so now

1256
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,564
the lay of the land is a lot

1257
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,983
less safe for myself, but it is

1258
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:34,984
what it is.

1259
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,027
>> PROBST: Shane, is it talked

1260
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,154
about, Terry's dominance?

1261
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,447
>> Yeah, it's absolutely

1262
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,865
apparent, but it's going to take

1263
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,575
him six immunities in a row to

1264
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,576
win.

1265
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,285
I don't think it can be done.

1266
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,329
If there's anyone that can do

1267
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,413
it, it's Terry.

1268
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,373
The guy is a 47-year-old beast

1269
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,292
and we as a group can't really

1270
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,293
afford to be eating

1271
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,004
cheeseburgers after today.

1272
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:55,630
>> But, regardless, I'm going to

1273
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,380
continue winning immunities

1274
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,424
whether they like it or not...

1275
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:58,758
>> Here we go.

1276
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,259
>> ...and my target isn't going

1277
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,260
to get any bigger.

1278
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,845
If I had five of these in my

1279
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,888
back pocket, I'd be out there

1280
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:04,805
competing, especially against

1281
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,140
Aras 'cause he's a bad dude and

1282
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,391
I want to go out there and beat

1283
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,517
him.

1284
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,977
>> PROBST: Danielle, Terry said

1285
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,020
"I'm gonna keep winning them."

1286
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,396
You mumbled "Here we go again."

1287
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,856
>> 'Cause he always talks about

1288
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,691
how he's so competitive and he's

1289
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,526
so great at everything and it's

1290
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,319
all about Terry, Terry, Terry,

1291
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,655
but power to him for being as

1292
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,948
confident and cocky as he is,

1293
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:22,865
but...

1294
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,491
>> PROBST: I just think it's an

1295
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,493
interesting comment coming from

1296
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,119
you, seeing how confident<i> you</i>

1297
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,704
were today and how cocky the six

1298
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,248
of you have been for the last

1299
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:30,831
several Tribals.

1300
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,457
>> Yeah, but I don't think we're

1301
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,501
coming off as strongly as Terry

1302
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,502
does.

1303
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,088
He's a super competitive guy.

1304
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,381
I'm not knocking that and I'm

1305
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,340
very competitive as well and...

1306
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,384
>> PROBST: Is that part of the

1307
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,260
problem-- that you can't beat

1308
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,512
him and it frustrates you?

1309
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,554
>> I mean, it is frustrating,

1310
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,639
but there's going to be a

1311
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,225
challenge where Terry can't win.

1312
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,559
I mean, if he keeps winning

1313
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,145
every single one, God bless him.

1314
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,231
>> PROBST: Cirie, five of the

1315
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,524
eight of you have now been to

1316
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,150
Exile Island, have now had a

1317
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:58,734
chance to look for the hidden

1318
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,443
immunity idol.

1319
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,487
Are people speculating if it's

1320
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,571
been found?

1321
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,489
>> There's, like, 15 million

1322
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,490
different stories.

1323
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,660
It's here, there it is, they

1324
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,286
don't have it, they have it.

1325
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,080
I think everyone here just wants

1326
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,707
it out.

1327
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,583
If you have it tonight, here's

1328
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,584
your chance.

1329
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,627
>> I don't want it played

1330
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,837
tonight because if it's played

1331
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,880
tonight, it's me most likely

1332
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,966
walking down that corridor, so

1333
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,509
let it play on a night where I

1334
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,552
have the immunity necklace.

1335
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,430
That's my thought.

1336
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,265
>> PROBST: Okay, Terry once

1337
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,683
again has the immunity necklace.

1338
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,143
As always, it's yours to assign

1339
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:32,727
to somebody else if you want.

1340
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,394
>> I'm keeping it.

1341
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,562
>> PROBST: Okay, if the hidden

1342
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,981
immunity idol comes into play,

1343
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,899
we will know after the vote.

1344
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,234
It is time to vote.

1345
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:42,403
Sally, you're up.

1346
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,495
>> (clicking tongue): I'm kind

1347
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,373
of sick of the six of you, so

1348
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,666
one at a time.

1349
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,764
>> Just strategy, nothing

1350
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,223
personal.

1351
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,559
Hope you have the idol.

1352
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,902
>> You're still the number one

1353
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,653
threat, buddy.

1354
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,790
>> You're a great player in this

1355
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,542
game and too much of a threat.

1356
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,586
So sorry.

1357
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,095
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1358
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,348
votes.

1359
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,563
Once the votes are read, the

1360
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,315
decision is final.

1361
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:01,857
The person voted out will be

1362
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,609
asked to leave the Tribal

1363
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,902
Council area immediately.

1364
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:08,948
I'll read the votes.

1365
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:14,120
First vote-- Sally.

1366
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,163
Sally.

1367
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:20,126
Two votes Sally.

1368
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:24,422
Aras.

1369
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,422
Aras.

1370
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,968
Two votes Sally, two votes Aras.

1371
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:32,888
Sally.

1372
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,098
That's three votes Sally, two

1373
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,059
votes Aras.

1374
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,061
Sally.

1375
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:39,645
Four votes Sally, two votes

1376
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,773
Aras.

1377
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,403
Ninth person voted out of

1378
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,696
<i>Survivor: Exile Island:</i> Sally.

1379
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,614
That's enough votes.

1380
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,657
Unless you have the immunity

1381
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,200
idol, you need to bring me your

1382
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,702
torch.

1383
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:13,387
Sally, the tribe has spoken.

1384
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:18,100
It's time for you to go.

1385
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,691
Well, at this point, the game

1386
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,694
seems pretty clear: six former

1387
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,695
Casaya against Terry.

1388
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,988
Terry says he's going to keep

1389
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,031
winning immunity, Casaya says he

1390
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,032
won't.

1391
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:33,616
Either way, going to be fun to

1392
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,575
watch.

1393
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,619
Grab your torches, head back to

1394
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,620
camp.

1395
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,663
Good night.

personal!

1418

game.

>> I am not disappointed that

00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,664
Terry didn't give me the hidden

1424
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:21,997
immunity idol.

1425
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,707
He's got a huge uphill battle

1426
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,541
ahead of him.

1427
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,793
I'm disappointed I can't be

1428
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,961
there fighting in the trenches

1429
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,588
beside him, but I found so much

1430
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,923
inner strength and I'll take

1431
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,675
that with me, and I learned a

1432
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,009
lot about myself in all this.

1433
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,094
You know, I fought hard and I
