1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:03,837
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,215
"SURVIVOR": 18 PEOPLE
BEGAN THE GAME.

3
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,135
TWO PLAYED BEFORE, BOSTON ROB
AND RUSSELL HANTZ.

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:17,225
TOGETHER THESE TWO OFFER 156
DAYS OF "SURVIVOR "EXPERIENCE.

5
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,603
THERE'S A NEW TWIST:
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,772
YOU'RE SENT HERE WHEN YOU'RE
VOTED OUT.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,232
FRANCESCA WAS FIRST.

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,316
SHE WAS MISERABLE.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,278
>> OH! GOD.

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,157
>> Jeff: LIVING ALONE, WAITING
FOR THE NEXT PERSON TO ARRIVE.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,159
AT THE ZAPATERA TRIBE, RUSSELL

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,285
TOLD EVERYONE THAT HE HAD
CHANGED.

13
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,830
>> I'M NOT HERE TO SABOTAGE
ANYTHING FROM NOBODY.

14
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:39,956
>> Jeff: HE LIED.

15
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:40,915
>> I HAVE TO BUILD TRUST WITH

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,334
THESE GUYS FOR ME TO STAB THEM
IN THE BACK.

17
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,753
>> Jeff: THEN HE MADE AN

18
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,005
ALLIANCE WITH THE TWO YOUNGEST
WOMEN ON THE BEACH.

19
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,716
>> KRISTA AND STEFANIE ARE MY
TWO GIRLS.

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,803
>> Jeff: AND WENT HUNTING FOR
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,972
BUT IT WAS RALPH WHO FOUND IT.

22
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,558
>> RUSSELL, EAT YOUR HEART OUT,
MAN.

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,979
>> Jeff: ZAPATERA WINS IMMUNITY!

24
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:05,648
DESPITE THE LOSS, ROB WAS STILL
IN CONTROL.

25
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,318
>> IT IS UNBELIEVABLE HOW WELL
HE CAN PLAY THIS GAME.

26
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,362
>> Jeff: BUT THEN, ROB TOOK HIS
GAME TO AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL.

27
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,574
>> THE WHEELS ARE IN MOTION FOR
EVERYTHING TO HAPPEN.

28
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,575
>> Jeff: SO HE CONVINCED PHILLIP

29
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,328
TO BE A DECOY AND PRETEND HE WAS
BEING VOTED OUT.

30
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,913
>> YOU'RE AN ACTOR, BRO.

31
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,123
YOU NEED TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
GOING HOME.

32
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,124
>> OKAY.

33
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:23,792
>> Jeff: AND HE LET KRISTINA

34
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,335
THINK IF SHE DIDN'T PLAY HER

35
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,504
IMMUNITY IDOL, SHE WOULD GO
HOME.

36
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,339
>> I'M PLAYING IT FOR SURE.

37
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:33,176
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
EVERYTHING WENT AS PLANNED.

38
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,512
>> JEFF, I THINK I'M GOING TO

39
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,222
NEED A LITTLE EXTRA HELP
TONIGHT.

40
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,390
>> Jeff: ALLOWING ROB TO BREAK
UP A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL

41
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,019
ALLIANCE BETWEEN ANDREA AND
MATT.

42
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,523
MATT, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

43
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,900
MATT WAS COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED.

44
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,194
NOW HE HEADS TO REDEMPTION
ISLAND TO TAKE ON FRANCESCA IN A

45
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,990
DUEL, LEAVING ANDREA WONDERING
WHERE SHE STANDS WITH ROB.

46
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,888
>> WHAT'S UP?
>> MATT?

47
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,682
>> YEAH.
>> I'M SHOCKED.

48
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,642
>> YEAH, I AM, TOO.
A LITTLE SHOCKED.

49
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,060
>> WOW.

50
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,395
WAIT A SECOND.

51
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,190
WHY ARE YOU HERE INSTEAD OF
PHILLIP?

52
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,734
>> WELL, THAT'S... THAT'S AN
EXCELLENT QUESTION.

53
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,696
>> WOW. SO MATT GOT BLINDSIDED.

54
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,447
I THOUGHT THAT SEEING ANY PART

55
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,785
OF ROB'S ALLIANCE TONIGHT WAS AN
IMPOSSIBILITY.

56
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,037
SO I JUST KNEW IT WOULD BE
PHILLIP.

57
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,581
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY OF MY STUFF
AT ALL.

58
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,584
I WAS COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED.

59
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,376
>> HE'S A...

60
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,087
>> SCOUNDREL.
>> UH-HUH.

61
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,921
>> YEAH.

62
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,299
I FEEL SICK TO MY STOMACH RIGHT
NOW.

63
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,426
LIKE, IT REALLY... IT REALLY
HURTS.

64
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,552
I MEAN, THERE'S A LITTLE ANGER.

65
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,598
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS I JUST
TRUSTED BOSTON TOO SOON.

66
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,309
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A GOOBER NOW
BECAUSE I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

67
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,393
EVERYTHING WAS GREAT AT CAMP.

68
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:10,607
EVERYONE WAS GETTING ALONG AND
THEN WAAH.

69
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,233
THIS IS BRUTAL.

70
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,819
IT'S DEFINITELY HARD TO COME
HERE AND PICK YOURSELF UP AFTER

71
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,071
YOU'VE BEEN AS BLINDSIDED AS I
WAS.

72
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,406
AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT AN
OPPORTUNITY.

73
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,744
TO BE THE UNDERDOG AND COME BACK
FROM REDEMPTION ISLAND AND

74
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,079
FINISH THIS GAME WITH A MILLION
DOLLARS.

75
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,420
>> HOW GOOD DID THAT WORK OUT
TONIGHT?

76
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,843
>> TONIGHT COULD NOT HAVE GONE
ANY BETTER.

77
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,137
NOT ONLY DO WE BLINDSIDE MATT.

78
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,682
WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE KRISTINA
GET RID OF HER IMMUNITY IDOL,

79
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,976
AND PHILLIP WAS A LOYAL SOLDIER.

80
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,271
FIRST OF ALL, YOU GET THE
ACADEMY AWARD OR THE EMMY?

81
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,648
>> I GET THE ACADEMY, HUH?
>> YEAH.

82
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,566
>> IT WAS NICE.
>> WOW.

83
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,001
THAT'S COOL.

84
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,504
YOU WON'T SEE ANY FLIP-FLOPPING
HERE.

85
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,423
WHEN I SHAKE-- WHEN I DO THAT
RIGHT THERE, MY WORD IS MY BOND.

86
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,511
>> TONIGHT I'M SITTING IN A GOOD
SPOT IN THIS TRIBE, BUT TOMORROW

87
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,973
MORNING WHEN I GET UP, I NEED TO
GET ANDREA FEELING OKAY ABOUT

88
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,850
EVERYTHING BECAUSE SHE'S SMART
ENOUGH TO

89
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,352
KNOW THAT WE DOUBLE CROSSED HER,

90
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,356
AND SHE WILL DEFINITELY HOLD
THAT RESENTMENT.

91
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,213
>> OPEN IT UP.

92
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,924
>> OKAY.

93
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:00,758
"FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE ARENA

94
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,760
WHERE YOU WILL COMPETE IN A
DUEL.

95
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,512
THE WINNER OF THE DUEL WILL
CONTINUE TO LIVE ON REDEMPTION

96
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,056
ISLAND AND AWAIT YOUR NEXT
OPPONENT.

97
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,392
THE LOSER GOES HOME THIS TIME
FOR GOOD."

98
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,893
>> THIS TIME FOR GOOD.

99
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,521
APPARENTLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
AN ARENA DUEL SOMEWHERE.

100
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,859
>> TREE MAIL.

101
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,861
THIS ONE'S GOING TO BE AN
INTERESTING ONE.

102
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,404
>> "TODAY YOU WON'T BE
COMPETING.

103
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:26,576
CHOOSE TWO WHO WILL GET A CHANCE
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LET

104
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,911
YOUR GUARD DOWN AT A PLACE WHICH

105
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,123
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE, REDEMPTION
ISLAND.

106
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,293
EACH OF YOU WILL REACH INTO THE
BAG AND TAKE ONE STONE."

107
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,253
>> OKAY, WHITE.

108
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,589
>> "IF YOU CHOOSE YOUR TRIBE-
COLORED STONE YOU WILL GO ON

109
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,965
THIS ADVENTURE."

110
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,133
>> WHITE.

111
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,927
SO THEN IT LOOKS LIKE ME AND
STEVE ARE GOING.

112
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,430
TREE MAIL TODAY
BASICALLY SAID TWO PEOPLE FROM

113
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,141
THE TRIBE ARE GOING TO GO TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

114
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,100
STEVE AND I WERE THE ONES WHO

115
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,102
ENDED UP TO BE THE ONES TO GO TO
THE DUEL.

116
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,645
>> GOOD-BYE, GUYS.
>> REMEMBER EVERYTHING YOU SEE.

117
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,606
>> AT REDEMPTION ISLAND I'M NOT
EXACTLY SURE WHAT TO EXPECT, BUT

118
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,443
I'M GLAD THAT RUSSELL AND
STEPHANIE AND CHRIS DIDN'T

119
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,903
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO SO

120
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,654
THEY DON'T HAVE AN IDEA OF
WHAT'S THERE.

121
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,244
>> ON THREE.

122
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,579
>> TURN THEM OVER, ALL RIGHT.

123
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,123
>> ONE, TWO, THREE.

124
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,417
>> HEY, GUYS!
>> HEY!

125
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,295
>> WE PICKED MARBLES AND ASHLEY
AND I GET TO GO AND WATCH THE

126
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,631
DUEL BETWEEN FRAN AND MATT SO
I'M PRETTY EXCITED.

127
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,635
IT'S PROBABLY MORE ABOUT SEEING
MATT BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY CLOSE

128
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,472
AND I THINK IF HE REALIZES I
WASN'T THE ONE THAT VOTED HIM

129
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,308
OUT HE COULD COME BACK AND BE AN
ASSET FOR ME TO HAVE.

130
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,311
>> CONGRATULATIONS.
>> HAVE FUN.

131
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,480
>> WE HAD TO SEND TWO PEOPLE TO

132
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,731
WHAT WE THINK IS REDEMPTION
ISLAND.

133
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,651
WE'VE GOT ANDREA AND ASHLEY BOTH
GOING OVER THERE.

134
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,154
WHAT I DON'T WANT IS ANDREA
GETTING SMART AND TALKING TO

135
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,281
MATT, HER ISLAND BOYFRIEND.

136
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,992
I JUST DON'T WANT HER GETTING
ANY IDEAS.

137
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,975
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE
COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S DUEL.

138
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:19,272
FRANCESCA AND MATT, VOTED OUT AT
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

139
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:28,156
WELCOME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND
ARENA.

140
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,575
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE DUELS WILL
TAKE PLACE.

141
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,577
EACH TRIBE SELECTED TWO TRIBE

142
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,706
MEMBERS TO BE A WITNESS TO YOUR
DUEL TODAY.

143
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,835
STEVE AND DAVE, AND ASHLEY AND
ANDREA.

144
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,754
MATT, FRANCESCA, BOTH OF YOU
VOTED OUT BY YOUR TRIBE MEMBERS

145
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,090
FOR WHATEVER REASON.

146
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,426
THEY DIDN'T WANT YOU AROUND
ANYMORE.

147
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,680
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN YOUR
JOURNEY TO GET EVEN.

148
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,225
>> I DIDN'T VOTE FOR EITHER OF
THEM.

149
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,728
>> Jeff: MATT, WHAT'S GOING
THROUGH YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW?

150
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,605
>> IT'S DO-OR-DIE TIME SO, LIKE,
I'M READY TO GO.

151
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,525
IT'S GOING TO BE THE GREATEST
UNDERDOG STORY IF I GET

152
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,112
BLINDSIDED BY MY TRIBE WITH NONE
OF MY STUFF EXCEPT FOR WHAT I

153
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,408
HAVE ON AND COME BACK ALL THE
WAY AND MAKE IT TO THE END.

154
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,869
>> Jeff: FRANCESCA, EVEN THOUGH
YOU GUYS WERE TRIBEMATES AT THE

155
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,079
BEGINNING, ARE YOU ADVERSARIES
NOW?

156
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,416
>> I WISH MATT VERY WELL IN HIS
LIFE, BUT I DEFINITELY AM HERE

157
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,876
TO BEAT HIM IN THIS GAME.

158
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,420
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET TO
TODAY'S DUEL.

159
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,088
FOR TODAY'S DUEL, YOU ARE GOING

160
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,717
TO USE STICKS AND ROPE TO MAKE A
LONG POLE.

161
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,554
YOU'LL USE THAT POLE TO RETRIEVE
THREE KEYS.

162
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,432
THOSE THREE KEYS OPEN THREE
LOCKS.

163
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:40,228
FIRST PERSON THROUGH THEIR DOOR
STAYS ALIVE IN THIS GAME.

164
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,812
LOSER IS OUT.

165
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,941
THEIR SHOT AT THE MILLION
DOLLARS, DONE.

166
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,651
IT'S ONE SHOT.
>> OKAY.

167
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,694
>> Jeff: TAKE YOUR SPOTS.
WE'LL GET STARTED.

168
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,412
THIS IS IT. DO-OR-DIE TIME.

169
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,457
SURVIVORS READY?

170
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,459
GO.

171
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,130
IT'S A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
"SURVIVOR" CHALLENGE-- STICKS

172
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,800
AND ROPES AND LOCKS.

173
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,135
WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE STAYS

174
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:18,516
ALIVE, CONTINUES THEIR QUEST FOR
A MILLION-DOLLAR PRIZE.

175
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:24,063
LOSERS WILL LEAVE THE ARENA FOR
GOOD, OUT OF THE GAME.

176
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,941
FRANCESCA GOING TO GIVE IT A GO
WITH HER STICK.

177
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,527
SHE PUT THAT TOGETHER QUICKLY.

178
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,449
WILL IT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO
RETRIEVE THAT FIRST KEY?

179
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,120
IT LOOKS LIKE IT.

180
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,871
STEADY.

181
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,332
NICE JOB.

182
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,835
FRANCESCA RETRIEVES THAT FIRST
KEY.

183
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,134
MATT GIVES IT A SHOT, AND HIS
STICK FALLS APART RIGHT AWAY.

184
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,678
FRANCESCA GIVING HER STICK A
LITTLE ONCE-OVER.

185
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,723
SHE'S GOING TO GO BACK NOW AND
TRY FOR A SECOND KEY.

186
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,059
SHE'S VERY CLOSE.

187
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,982
CAN SHE GET IT OFF THE PEG?

188
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,525
YES.

189
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:12,069
NOW CAN SHE GET IT BACK?

190
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,905
DOING A GREAT JOB.

191
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,034
FRANCESCA HAS HER SECOND KEY,
ONE KEY LEFT.

192
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,410
>> GET IT, GET IT.

193
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,411
>> Jeff: MATT IS GOING TO HAVE

194
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,539
TO PICK IT UP NOW, START TAKING
SOME CHANCES.

195
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,584
HE'S ON IT.

196
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,712
OH, THAT STICK IS NOT GOING TO
STAY TOGETHER.

197
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,881
FRANCESCA GOING FOR THAT THIRD
KEY.

198
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,634
THIS COULD BE IT FOR FRANCESCA.

199
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,886
THAT KEY IS A LITTLE FURTHER
OUT, THOUGH.

200
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,389
CAN SHE REACH IT?

201
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,391
SHE'S THERE.

202
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,895
OH! STICK BREAKS.

203
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,733
MATT GIVING IT ANOTHER GO.

204
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,568
MATT HAS THE KEY HOOKED.

205
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:56,238
HE HAS IT OFF THE PEG.

206
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,575
MATT HAS HIS FIRST KEY BACK.

207
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,078
MATT NOW GOING FOR THE SECOND
KEY.

208
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,663
THAT STICK LOOKS LIKE IT'S
WORKING NOW.

209
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,335
GOTTA GET IT OFF THAT PEG.

210
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,924
MATT GOING FOR THAT SECOND KEY,
AND HE HAS IT.

211
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,593
CAN HE GET IT THROUGH THE GATE?

212
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,594
YES.

213
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,096
MATT HAS HIS SECOND KEY.

214
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,723
FRANCESCA GOING FOR THAT
THIRD KEY.

215
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,934
MATT NOW GOING FOR HIS THIRD
KEY.

216
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,729
BOTH MATT AND FRANCESCA HAVE ONE
KEY LEFT.

217
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,566
YOU WANT TO STAY ALIVE, YOU NEED
TO GET IT GOING RIGHT NOW.

218
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,401
IS THE POLE LONG ENOUGH?

219
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,112
HE'S ON THE KEY, JUST SHORT,
USING

220
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,989
EVERY PART OF HIS BODY, STILL
SHORT, AN INCH, HALF AN INCH

221
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,908
SHORT, MAYBE.

222
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,787
FRANCESCA HAS THE KEY.

223
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,667
MATT JUST MISSES GRABBING THE
KEY.

224
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,752
FRANCESCA-- OH!

225
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,505
JUST MISSED HOOKING IT.

226
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,424
MATT IS LONG ENOUGH.

227
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,466
IS IT STRONG ENOUGH?

228
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,968
MATT HAS THE THIRD KEY.

229
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,970
HE'S GOT TO GET IT THROUGH THE
GATE.

230
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,973
HE'S HOLDING ON.

231
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,641
MATT HAS ALL THREE KEYS!

232
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,268
HE CAN START OPENING THE LOCKS.

233
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,146
FRANCESCA NEEDS TO MAKE A MOVE
QUICKLY.

234
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,189
MATT HAS THE FIRST LOCK OPEN.

235
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,319
MATT HAS THE SECOND LOCK OPEN.

236
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,198
THIS IS IT FOR FRANCESCA.

237
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,117
MATT HAS THE THIRD LOCK OPEN.

238
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,994
MATT STAYS ALIVE!

239
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,624
>> GOOD JOB.
>> GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

240
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,626
GIVE 'EM HELL.

241
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,886
>> Jeff: MATT, CONGRATULATIONS.

242
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,388
YOU SEIZED THE MOMENT.

243
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,807
YOU ARE STILL ALIVE IN THIS
GAME.

244
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,309
FRANCESCA, YOUR SHOT AT

245
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,519
REDEMPTION AND THE MILLION-
DOLLAR PRIZE IS OVER.

246
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,645
YOU'RE OUT OF THE GAME.

247
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,232
YOU CAN TOSS YOUR BUFF IN THE
FIRE ON YOUR WAY OUT.

248
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,693
>> BYE, HONEY.
>> LOVE YOU, FRANNY.

249
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,077
>> Jeff: MATT, YOU CAN HEAD BACK

250
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,705
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND, AWAIT YOUR
NEXT OPPONENT.

251
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,874
>> THANKS, JEFF.
>> Jeff: WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

252
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,461
>> BECAUSE IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO THE CAMP WE HAD BACK AT

253
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:19,673
OMETEPE, AND BEING BY YOURSELF
IT'S DEFINITELY HARD, BUT I

254
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,717
MEAN, GOTTA SEIZE THE MOMENT.

255
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,551
>> Jeff: IT'S ON YOU.

256
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,053
GET BACK TO REDEMPTION. MAKE IT
HAPPEN.

257
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,597
>> WILL DO.

258
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,224
>> Jeff: GUYS, YOU CAN HEAD BACK
TO CAMP.

259
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,351
AS ALWAYS, WHATEVER YOU
WITNESSED

260
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,562
HERE, WHEN YOU GO BACK TO CAMP,
UP TO YOU WHAT YOU SHARE.

261
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,356
HEAD ON OUT.

262
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,066
>> GOING TO REDEMPTION ISLAND
WAS AN EYE OPENER.

263
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,068
THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY
HERE.

264
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,280
I'M THINKING THERE MIGHT BE SOME
CURVEBALL FOR RUSSELL TO TELL

265
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,284
THEM THAT FRANCESCA WON THE
CHALLENGE AND SENT MATT HOME.

266
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,964
>> THEY'RE BACK!

267
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,382
>> OH!

268
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,383
>> OH, THEY MADE IT.

269
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,886
>> YEAH, ALL RIGHT!

270
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,555
>> IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK!

271
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,973
>> WELCOME BACK.

272
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,183
>> HOW'S MATT?
>> HE'S GOOD.

273
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,601
>> HE'S PISSED. YOU CAN TELL.

274
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,395
>> YEAH.
>> WHAT DID HE SAY?

275
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,272
>> WE DIDN'T GET TO TALK TO HIM.

276
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,148
HE KEPT LOOKING UP AT US AND

277
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,443
SAYING HE WANTS TO COME BACK AND
GET HIS REVENGE.

278
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,195
>> REDEMPTION ISLAND IS REAL.

279
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,115
I MEAN, THERE'S A CHANCE MATT
COULD RUN THE GAMUT OVER THERE

280
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,117
AND COME BACK INTO THIS GAME.

281
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,954
ANDREA WILL GO BACK TO MATT
BEFORE SHE'LL STAY WITH ME.

282
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,497
I KNOW THAT.

283
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,793
SO I'VE GOT MY WORK CUT OUT FOR
ME WITH ANDREA.

284
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,753
I LIKE YOU, ANDREA, AND I THINK

285
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:44,675
YOU'RE A GOOD-HEARTED KID, YOU
KNOW.

286
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,968
I'M SORRY WHAT HAPPENED, YOU
KNOW.

287
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,470
I AM.

288
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,471
AND, LIKE, IF I COULD HAVE

289
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,600
THOUGHT OF ANY OTHER WAY, THEN I
WOULD HAVE.

290
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,143
BUT IT WASN'T JUST ME.

291
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,604
>> I UNDERSTAND.
>> THERE WERE FOUR PEOPLE THAT

292
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,646
WERE INVOLVED IN IT.

293
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,314
FOUR PEOPLE AGREED TO IT.

294
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,025
FOUR PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT IT.

295
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,484
NOBODY WANTED TO DO IT.

296
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,153
>> NO, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE I
STAND NOW.

297
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,863
>> I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE STILL

298
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,991
IN THE-- LIKE, I KNOW, IT'S
CRAZY.

299
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,494
>> SO PHILLIP AND CHRISTINE ARE
GOING BEFORE ME?

300
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,705
>> YEAH.

301
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,833
>> I TALKED TO ROB, AND HE
ASSURED ME THAT I'M STILL PART

302
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,003
OF THEIR FIVE, EVEN THOUGH I
HAVE A FEELING I'M PROBABLY IN A

303
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,671
REALLY STICKY POSITION.

304
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,467
SO RIGHT NOW, STRATEGICALLY
IT'S SMART TO STAY WITH THEM AND

305
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,135
MAKE SURE THEY DON'T THINK I'M

306
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,846
SCHEMING, BUT I JUST DON'T
BELIEVE HIM.

307
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:36,518
I NEED IN SOME WAY TO MIX THINGS
UP BECAUSE, LIKE, DEEP DOWN,

308
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,146
I'M LIKE STILL REALLY PISSED
ABOUT WHAT THEY DID.

309
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,066
THEY, LIKE, TOOK MY GOOD FRIEND
AWAY.

310
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,084
>> THE TWO BLONDES.

311
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,586
THEY WERE SITTING UP WITH US IN
A GLADIATOR STADIUM.

312
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,879
>> WHO WON?

313
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,714
>> THE BLACK CHICK PULLED IT OFF

314
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,717
AND THE BLOND KID HE WENT HOME.

315
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,097
WE CAME BACK FROM REDEMPTION
ISLAND AND WE TOLD RUSSELL THAT

316
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,765
MATT WAS SENT HOME.

317
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,767
>> FIRST OUT, SURFER GUY.

318
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,854
>> SO WHENEVER WE VOTE RUSSELL
OUT, HE'LL GET OVER THERE AND

319
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,400
SEE MATT, WHO COULD BE A-- QUITE
A CHALLENGE FOR HIM AND

320
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,443
HOPEFULLY WE'LL NEVER SEE
RUSSELL AGAIN.

321
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,654
>> ACTUALLY, THE BLACK GIRL WENT
HOME.

322
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,280
>> THE BLACK GIRL WENT HOME?
>> THE BLOND DUDE IS THERE.

323
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,241
I JUST WANTED HIM TO BE SHOCKED.

324
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,369
I JUST WANT HIM TO BE SHOCKED
WHEN HE GETS THERE AND HE'S

325
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,079
WRESTLING THE BLOND DUDE.

326
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,083
>> THAT'S AWESOME.

327
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,420
>> I KNOW IT IS 6-3.

328
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,047
SO RIGHT NOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT

329
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,757
THING FOR ME IS FINDING THE
IDOL.

330
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,720
IF I FIND THE IDOL, RUSSELL GETS
ANOTHER BLINDSIDE.

331
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,264
"WHERE SOMETHING IS ALIVE
NEXT TO SOMETHING THAT'S NOT."

332
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,267
THAT'S WHAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT.

333
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,477
AT THE LAST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE I

334
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,772
GOT THE CLUE FOR THE IDOL, BUT
IT'S SO VAGUE.

335
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,817
"SOMETHING THAT'S ALIVE," THE
BEACH IS DEFINITELY ALIVE.

336
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,777
EVERYTHING OUT HERE IS ALIVE,

337
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,740
THE TREES, THE RUNNING WATER.

338
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,992
WHERE IS THE IDOL?

339
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,535
THE CLUE SAID IT WAS BY

340
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:20,456
SOMETHING ALIVE NEXT TO
SOMETHING NOT.

341
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,418
MY MIND IS RUNNING 100 MILES PER
HOUR.

342
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,131
>> RUSSELL AND THEM ARE STILL
LOOKING FOR THE IDOL JUST AS

343
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,135
HARD AS THEY CAN LOOK BUT HE
AIN'T GOING TO GET IT NOW.

344
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,303
'CAUSE I'VE GOT IT.

345
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,680
AND I'M NOT SAYING NOTHING ABOUT

346
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,183
IT, SO THIS IS NOT RUSSELL'S
GAME NO MORE.

347
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,559
IT'S MY GAME.

348
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,561
>> I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S HERE.

349
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:56,241
>> THE GREAT THING WITH RUSSELL
IS THAT HE HAS A GREAT RESUME

350
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,828
WITH IMMUNITY IDOLS THAT HE'S
FOUND ON HIS OWN.

351
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,122
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT IT
ALL IN YOUR PURSE.

352
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,165
>> YEAH.

353
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,834
SO WE ARE GOING TO FAKE THAT
WE HAVE THE IDOL.

354
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,213
AND I AM HOPING THAT PEOPLE

355
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,800
BELIEVE I'M PROTECTING THE
IMMUNITY IDOL.

356
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,343
BUT RIGHT NOW, IT IS JUST A
BLANK

357
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,180
CHECK WITH NO MONEY IN THE BANK
ACCOUNT.

358
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,474
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

359
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,559
>> SHE'S KEEPING A TIGHT HOLD OF
THAT BAG, ISN'T SHE?

360
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,187
>> YOU KNOW IT.
>> ALL BUTTONED UP.

361
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,188
DON'T BURN THAT BAG, DARLING.

362
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,358
THERE'S GOLD IN THERE.

363
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,652
YOU WANT ME TO HOLD IT FOR YOU
FOR A WHILE?

364
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,529
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOUR LEGS WERE
GETTING TIRED.

365
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,155
>> I'M GOOD.

366
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,700
>> ALL RIGHT.

367
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,203
>> I LIKE TO WATCH THE TWO GIRLS
WITH THAT BAG.

368
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,996
I WANT TO.

369
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,666
I MEAN, WATCH THEM. WATCH THEM.

370
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,001
>> WE KNEW THAT RUSSELL AND HIS

371
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:52,548
LITTLE HAREM HAVE GOT THE FIRST
IMMUNITY CLUE.

372
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,591
STEPHANIE'S CARRYING THE BAG

373
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,220
AROUND ACTING LIKE SHE HAS THE
IDOL IN THERE.

374
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,346
>> WHEN RUSSELL ORDERS IT, THEY
DO IT.

375
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,224
>> I KNOW.

376
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,892
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT,
BROTHER.

377
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,435
RUSSELL IS ALWAYS PLOTTING AND
SCHEMING.

378
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,021
YOU JUST DON'T WANT THE GUY
AROUND.

379
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:08,856
YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO DO

380
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,192
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO BACKSTAB
YOU.

381
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,570
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE
STAY ON OUR TOES UNTIL THAT

382
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,114
CANCER IS CUT OUT.

383
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,541
>> YOU SHOULD JUST LAY DOWN LIKE
THAT.

384
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,751
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING.

385
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,420
>> THIS ONE DOESN'T LOOK BAD.
IT'S CLEARING UP.

386
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,923
>> YEAH, THAT ONE IS CLEARING
UP.

387
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,428
>> RUSSELL HAS GOT SOME FUNK
GOING ON WITH HIS ARMPITTS.

388
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,429
HE SHAVED THEM UP AND NOW HE'S
GOT

389
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:45,434
A PUSS-FILLED RASH ALL OVER THE
PLACE.

390
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,978
I MEAN, IT'S DISGUSTING.

391
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,314
>> IT FEELS LIKE IT'S GETTING
WORSE.

392
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,442
>> HE SITS IN THE TENT WITH HIS
CONCUBINES AND DOES NOTHING.

393
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,111
HE'S LIKE A BLACK HOLE, YOU
KNOW, SUCKING IN ENERGY AND

394
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,446
LIGHT, EVERYTHING.

395
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,114
>> I REALLY THINK-- MY FEELING

396
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,491
IS GET RID OF RUSSELL SOONER
THAN LATER.

397
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,784
>> OH, YEAH. THE SOONER THE
BETTER.

398
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,579
>> HE'D BE NO GOOD-- HE'D BE NO
GOOD-- HE'D BE A THORN IN OUR

399
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,581
SIDE TO KEEP AROUND UNTIL THE
MERGE.

400
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,124
>> I AGREE.

401
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,417
>> HE AIN'T DOING A THING.

402
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,794
>> HE'S NOT LIFTING ANY LOGS.

403
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,755
>> HE AIN'T CARRYING NO WOOD,
NOT CATCHING ANYTHING TO EAT.

404
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,964
>> YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY ALWAYS
THINKS

405
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,132
YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW A
CHALLENGE.

406
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,593
THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF
SUCCESS THROWING CHALLENGES

407
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,637
BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE

408
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,471
DOWN NUMBERS BUT HE'S NOT A
NUMBER.

409
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,848
>> NO.

410
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,184
>> THERE REALLY IS NOTHING
BIGGER AT THIS POINT THAN TO GET

411
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:27,684
RID OF RUSSELL.

412
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,352
HE'S AN IRRITANT.

413
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,479
YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS GUY LAY

414
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,482
AROUND AND POTENTIALLY BITE ANY
ONE OF US.

415
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,442
>> HEY, SO LET ME THROW THIS OUT
HERE TO YOU.

416
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,861
IF WE HAD A CHALLENGE OR
SOMETHING WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO

417
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,490
THROW IT AND JUST GET RID OF
RUSSELL BEFORE HE EVEN FINDS THE

418
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,783
SECOND CLUE OR THIRD CLUE.

419
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,536
>> I DON'T WANT TO THROW THINGS,
BUT HE'S LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

420
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,996
HE'S BROKEN RIGHT NOW.

421
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,497
HE'S GOT RASHES EVERYWHERE.

422
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,374
HE HURTS LIKE HELL.

423
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,334
THIS IS THE TIME WHEN YOU LAY
THE FINAL BLOW.

424
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,880
>> ONLY THING WITH THROWING ONE,
YOU GUYS, IS THAT THEY'RE NOT

425
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,175
GOING TO BE GETTING RID OF ONE
MORE PERSON AND THEY MIGHT START

426
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,261
GETTING A ROLL GOING AND IT
COULD REVERSE ON US.

427
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,848
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THROWING
OUR NEXT CHALLENGE.

428
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,809
I'M JUST TORN.

429
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,310
I'M TORN ABOUT THAT.

430
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,814
BECAUSE I LIKE TO COMPETE, AND I
CAN DEAL WITH RUSSELL.

431
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,649
>> WE'LL DECIDE WHEN WE GET
THERE.

432
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,360
ONE THUMBS UP MEANS WE'RE
THROWING IT.

433
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,125
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

434
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,096
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

435
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,389
>> WE ARE.

436
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,767
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, ZAPATERA,
ONCE AGAIN I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

437
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,984
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

438
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,195
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, THREE
MEMBERS OF EACH TRIBE WILL BE

439
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,573
STRAPPED TO A LARGE WHEEL.

440
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,243
THREE OTHER MEMBERS WILL WORK
TOGETHER TO SPIN THE WHEEL.

441
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:12,330
AS THE WHEEL TURNS, YOU WILL GO
UNDERWATER, GRAB A MOUTHFUL OF

442
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,417
WATER, COME BACK TO THE TOP, AND
SPIT THE WATER OUT INTO A TUBE.

443
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,588
ONCE THE TUBE FILLS, A BALL
WILL ROLL DOWN TO A SLIDE PUZZLE

444
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,424
WHERE ONE TRIBE MEMBER MUST
SOLVE THE PUZZLE.

445
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,552
FIRST TRIBE TO GET THEIR BALL
THROUGH THE COMPLETED SLIDE

446
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,473
PUZZLE WINS IMMUNITY AND IS SAFE
FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL.

447
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,351
IN ADDITION, YOU ARE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.

448
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,273
>> OH!
>> OH!

449
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,275
>> Jeff: A LOT OF COMFORT ITEMS
HERE.

450
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,985
YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF CHAIRS.

451
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:46,782
PILLOWS, TARP, THREE BLANKETS,
AND A LANTERN.

452
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,786
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE THE THIRD PERSON WILL BE

453
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,789
VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME AND SENT
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

454
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,290
ZAPATERA, YOU HAVE TWO EXTRA

455
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,667
TRIBE MEMBERS-- SITTING TWO
PEOPLE OUT.

456
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,756
>> THERE'S DEFINITELY A BIG
TRADEOFF THERE BETWEEN KEEPING

457
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,801
RUSSELL AROUND AND GETTING A
TARP BUT THE PLAN AS IT STANDS

458
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,260
RIGHT NOW IS TO THROW THE
CHALLENGE.

459
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,263
HOPEFULLY THE END RESULT IS
WORTH IT.

460
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,349
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WHO'S IT
GOING TO BE, ZAPATERA?

461
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,143
>> RALPH AND SERITA.

462
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,437
>> Jeff: SERITA AND RALPH, TAKE
A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

463
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,605
EVERYBODY ELSE, I'LL GIVE YOU A

464
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,358
MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE AND WE'LL
GET STARTED.

465
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,529
>> I'M GOING TO DO THE PUZZLE
PART.

466
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,988
YOU GUYS WORK THE WHEEL.

467
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:27,948
>> JULIE.

468
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,575
>> SHE'S GONNA JUST BE MISSING
THE BUCKET.

469
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,829
MISS THE BUCKET. MISS THE
BUCKET.

470
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,871
IF YOU WANT TO THROW IT.

471
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,833
>> RIGHT NOW THE PLAN IS TO
THROW THE CHALLENGE.

472
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,751
IT'S A DECISION I'M NOT REALLY
FEELING RIGHT WITH.

473
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,547
>> Jeff: HERE WE GO.

474
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,134
FOR IMMUNITY AND REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY?

475
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,136
GO!

476
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,975
NATALIE WITH A LOT OF WATER.

477
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:55,976
>> COME ON, GUYS.

478
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,020
>> Jeff: STEPHANIE WITH A GOOD
SPIT OF WATER.

479
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,314
BOTH TRIBES DOING VERY WELL.

480
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,570
TAKES A LOT OF GUTS TO BE THE
PEOPLE ON THE WHEEL BEING THROWN

481
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,574
UNDERWATER EVERY FEW SECONDS TO
TAKE IN A MOUTHFUL OF WATER AND

482
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,617
THEN SPIT IT INTO A TUBE.

483
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,372
>> COME ON.

484
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,582
>> Jeff: KRISTINA WITH A GOOD
JOB.

485
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,002
KRISTA DOES A NICE JOB.

486
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,422
JULIE MISSES.

487
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,550
OMETEPE HAS THIS NAILED.

488
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,052
ZAPATERA NOT SO MUCH.

489
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,220
>> COME ON!

490
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,222
>> Jeff: STEVE SEEMS TO BE
WEARING OUT.

491
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,266
>> COME ON, GUYS!

492
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,729
>> Jeff: OMETEPE RELEASES THEIR
BALL.

493
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,730
ROB CAN NOW START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.

494
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,357
>> COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

495
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,692
>>Jeff: BIG HEAD START FOR ROB.

496
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,360
>> LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

497
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,445
>> LET'S GO, ROB!

498
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,864
>> Jeff: ZAPATERA REALLY SLOWING
DOWN.

499
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,200
DAVID WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SHOT
AT THIS PUZZLE.

500
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,242
>> GOOD JOB, ROB!

501
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,912
>> Jeff: ROB WORKING QUICKLY ON
THE SLIDE PUZZLE.

502
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,787
>> COME ON, GUYS.

503
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,748
>> COME ON, STEF!

504
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,750
THERE YOU GO.

505
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,585
>> Jeff: ZAPATERA RELEASES THEIR
BALL.

506
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,754
DAVID CAN START WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.

507
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,130
>> COME ON, DAVE.

508
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,966
>> Jeff: IT IS A SHOWDOWN
BETWEEN THE PUZZLE MAKERS.

509
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,843
DAVID AND ROB.

510
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,764
ZAPATERA WON IN THIS SHOWDOWN AT
THE VERY FIRST CHALLENGE.

511
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,267
ROB LOOKING FOR A LITTLE
REDEMPTION, WOULD LIKE TO BRING

512
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,561
HOME IMMUNITY FOR OMETEPE.

513
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,606
ZAPATERA HAS YET TO GO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

514
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,609
>> COME ON, DAVE, YOU CAN DO
THIS.

515
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,778
>> Jeff: ROB MAKING SOME
PROGRESS.

516
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,112
>> COME ON, DAVE.

517
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:31,738
>> Jeff: DAVE BARELY WORKING.

518
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,782
>> COME ON, DAVE.

519
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,824
>> YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD, ROB,
KEEP IT UP.

520
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,785
>> Jeff: ROB GETTING CLOSER TO
THE FINISH.

521
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,288
>> COME ON ROB!

522
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,456
>> COME ON DAVID!

523
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,666
COME ON, YOU'RE THE MAN!

524
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,792
>> YEAH, ROB!

525
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,793
>> THERE YOU GO, ROB.

526
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,753
>> Jeff: ROB THINKS HE HAS IT.

527
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,797
>> GO, ROB!

528
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,965
>> Jeff: ROB HAS IT.

529
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,259
HE'S GOT THE BALL IN THE
CHANNEL.

530
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,635
IT'S AS EASY AS THAT.

531
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,805
OMETEPE WINS THEIR FIRST
CHALLENGE!

532
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,808
REWARD AND IMMUNITY.

533
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,851
>> YEAH, BABY!

534
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,605
>> ALL RIGHT!

535
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,316
>> Jeff: OMETEPE,
CONGRATULATIONS.

536
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,156
ROB, FIRST WIN FOR THIS TRIBE.

537
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,324
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

538
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,659
>> OVERDUE.

539
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,159
>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR REWARD.

540
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:18,827
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

541
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,870
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

542
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,003
ALL RIGHT, ZAPATERA, NEW
EXPERIENCE TONIGHT.

543
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,379
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE YOU WILL

544
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,798
VOTE YOUR FIRST PERSON OUT OF
THE TRIBE.

545
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,134
THAT PERSON WILL GO TO
REDEMPTION AND WILL HAVE TO

546
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,844
COMPETE IN A DUEL TO STAY ALIVE.

547
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,470
GRAB YOUR STUFF. HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

548
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,055
I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL.

549
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,640
>> IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER,

550
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,058
I WOULD THINK THEY THREW THE
CHALLENGE.

551
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,686
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM LET THE
CHALLENGE GO.

552
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,729
I'M DEALING WITH A BUNCH OF
BITCHES.

553
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,290
>> WE WON TODAY'S IMMUNITY AND
REWARD CHALLENGE, AND NORMALLY,

554
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,126
THAT WOULD PUT ME THROUGH THE
ROOF HAPPY.

555
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,753
BUT NOW WE HAVE THESE LITTLE

556
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,714
THINGS CALLED HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOLS.

557
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,051
NOW I KNOW ENOUGH THAT THERE'S
PROBABLY A CLUE TO THAT HIDDEN

558
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,680
IMMUNITY IDOL SOMEWHERE HIDDEN
WITHIN OUR REWARD, AND IT WAS

559
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:24,517
ALMOST AS IF THERE WAS NO TIME
TO CELEBRATE BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S

560
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,561
LOOKING FOR WHERE THE CLUE COULD
BE.

561
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,563
THE GAME IS ALWAYS ON.

562
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,739
IN THE PAST, I IGNORED THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

563
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,367
WELL, THAT DIDN'T TURN OUT TOO
GOOD FOR ME.

564
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,036
SO THIS TIME AROUND I DECIDED

565
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,913
MAYBE I CAN LEARN SOMETHING,
TOO.

566
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,582
SO I'M STARTING TO LOOK FOR
THEM, AND I'M STARTING TO BE

567
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,667
DILIGENT ABOUT IT.

568
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,550
I WENT THROUGH EVERYTHING.

569
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,760
AND IT WAS NOWHERE.

570
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,429
I LOOK OVER AND I SEE PHILLIP'S

571
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,806
FAT ASS BENDING THE CHAIR ABOUT
TO BREAK IT.

572
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,266
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

573
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,310
>> IT FEELS GOOD.
>> WHY IS IT LOPSIDED?

574
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,144
>> IT'S PROBABLY MISSING A SCREW

575
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,271
AND I'M PROBABLY NOT ON EVEN
GROUND.

576
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,564
>> HOLD ON.

577
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,108
YEAH, DON'T BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK IT.

578
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,693
>> THINK SO?
>> SIT OVER HERE.

579
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,570
GET A SCREW.

580
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,156
>> I LOOKED DOWN AND THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE IS RIGHT

581
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,659
UNDERNEATH HIS ASS.

582
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:27,122
IT'S SITTING, SEWN INSIDE THE
FABRIC OF THE CHAIR.

583
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,958
I GOTTA FIX THIS.

584
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,960
I THINK I HAVE A SCREW IN THE
TOOLBOX.

585
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,477
SWEET.

586
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,313
"ROCKS, TREES, LOGS, AND SAND.

587
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,651
FORAGING, CLIMBING OR MAYBE
DIGGING YOU'LL BE.

588
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,987
THE IDOL IS NEAR ONE OF THE
ABOVE.

589
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,156
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLORE THEM ALL
TO SEE."

590
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,157
THE CLUE BASICALLY COULD HAVE

591
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,952
READ "THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
IS SOMEWHERE."

592
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,830
I MEAN, IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

593
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,665
I'M HAPPY THAT I FOUND THE CLUE

594
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:12,041
BECAUSE I KNOW NOW THAT NOBODY
ELSE FOUND THE CLUE.

595
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,043
I'M GOING DOWN FOR A LITTLE CRAB
ATTACK.

596
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,504
BUT I DON'T PLAN ON TELLING

597
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,133
ANYBODY ABOUT THE CLUE BECAUSE I
WANT THE IDOL FOR ME.

598
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,147
>> LET'S GET THE FIRE GOING.

599
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,858
>> I'LL GET IT. I'LL GET IT.

600
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,486
WELL, IT WAS A THROWN CHALLENGE.

601
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,905
BECAUSE WE DO GOTTA GET RUSSELL
OUT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

602
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:46,868
RUSSELL THINKS HE RUNS THE SHOW,
AND HE DON'T.

603
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,371
HE'S NOT MY BOSS AND HE'S NOT
BOSS OF ME.

604
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,916
>> DO WE HAVE A PLAN?

605
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,418
>> YEAH.
>> STICKING TO THAT?

606
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,002
>> STICKING TO THE PLAN.

607
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,713
WE'RE GOING TO GO 3-3.

608
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:01,883
>> THE PLAN TONIGHT IS TO GIVE
THREE VOTES TO RUSSELL AND THREE

609
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:07,388
VOTES TO STEPHANIE IN THE
ABSOLUTELY REMOTE, RARE EVENT

610
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,932
THAT RUSSELL DID FIND AN IDOL.

611
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,893
SO IF EVERYTHING GOES AS PLANNED
TONIGHT, RUSSELL WILL GO HOME.

612
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,062
>> IT'S STUPID TO THROW

613
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,105
CHALLENGES WHEN YOU ARE ONLY TWO
UP.

614
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,734
I CAN SEE IF YOU'RE FIVE UP OR
SOMETHING, FOUR UP, MAYBE.

615
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,818
>> YEAH.

616
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,403
>> BUT TWO UP?

617
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,864
WHEN THE GAME JUST STARTED?

618
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,700
WHAT DO THEY WANT TO GO EVEN AT
THE MERGE?

619
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,078
I THINK THEY THREW THE
CHALLENGE.

620
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,079
IT MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH

621
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,873
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WIN RIGHT
NOW.

622
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,750
YOU CAN'T GIVE BOSTON ROB
MOMENTUM.

623
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,960
NOT IN THIS GAME.

624
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:40,088
IF THEY SPLIT THE VOTES, IT WILL
BE A TWO-WAY TIE.

625
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,132
ONE WILL BE SAFE, THEY WOULD
REVOTE AND I WOULD GO HOME.

626
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,760
I HAVE TO CONVINCE SOMEBODY TO
FLIP.

627
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,263
ONE PERSON.

628
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,933
>> TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, WE
WERE THINKING THE VOTES WOULD BE

629
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,103
SPLIT 3-3-3 BECAUSE THEY WOULD
WANT TO FLUSH OUT THE IDOL AND

630
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,938
GET RID OF ONE OF US.

631
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,191
SO ALL IT WOULD TAKE IS FOR ONE
OF THEIR SIX TO FLIP ON THEM AND

632
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:05,154
VOTE WITH US, SO THAT WE WOULD
GET THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTES.

633
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,157
>> DO YOU THINK... THE OLD LADY
WILL?

634
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,457
>> OKAY.

635
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,919
>> WOULD IT BE WEIRD IF I ASKED
YOU WHERE DO YOU THINK EXACTLY

636
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,046
YOU STAND WITH THE SIX PEOPLE
YOU HAVE?

637
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,966
WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE OUR ONE,
TWO, THREE.

638
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,509
>> RIGHT. YOU GUYS ARE STRONG.

639
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,803
>> YOU KNOW.
>> I DON'T KNOW.

640
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,972
>> WELL, WE HAVE STUFF UP OUR
SLEEVES.

641
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,142
>> YEAH.
>> BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

642
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,979
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE FOURTH
PERSON.

643
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,188
>> SEE, AND RUSSELL KNOWS HOW TO
GET TO THE END.

644
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,483
>> AND WE HAVE THE IDOL.
>> RIGHT ON.

645
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,694
>> WE SHOULD SIT DOWN. I'M
GETTING...

646
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,155
>> YOU'RE GETTING LIGHTHEADED.

647
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,783
AND TO BE HONEST I LIKE MY
CHANCES WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS

648
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,660
BEEN THERE BEFORE A COUPLE TIMES
BEFORE.

649
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,953
>> EXACTLY.

650
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,163
>> IF I DO BECOME A FOURTH...

651
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:59,667
>> YOU NEED TO REMEMBER, HE WILL
TAKE US TO THE TOP.

652
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,002
AND THEN AFTER THAT...

653
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,003
>> IT MAKES SENSE. I MEAN, IT
MAKES SENSE.

654
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,672
>> IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

655
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,926
>> THIS IS A GAME TURNER RIGHT
HERE, THIS VOTE.

656
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,471
SO, IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.

657
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,348
I HAVE THOUGHT IT OUT BOTH WAYS.

658
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,974
SHOULD I GO WITH RUSSELL?

659
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:15,683
SHOULD I TRUST HIM?

660
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,143
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW GOOD HE IS.

661
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,228
>> SHE'S ON OUR SIDE.

662
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,064
>> OKAY. NOW, I'M GOING TO TALK
TO HER.

663
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:25,902
>> OKAY. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE
BIGGEST BLINDSIDE EVER.

664
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,949
>> IF YOU-- IF YOU DO THIS, IF
THIS GOES THE WAY IT GOES, I GOT

665
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:32,617
YOUR (<i> NO AUDIO</i> ) BACK.

666
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,327
>> OKAY, I TRUST YOU, DUDE.

667
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,037
>> LET'S DO IT.

668
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,414
RALPH.

669
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,376
LET'S GET RID OF RALPH.

670
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,711
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU DO THIS
WITH ME, I GOT YOU.

671
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,837
>> ALL RIGHT.

672
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,719
>> IF THIS HAPPENS, GAME ON.

673
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,096
THIS WILL BE THE BIGGEST MOVE,

674
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,598
BIGGER THAN ANY MOVE I'VE EVER
MADE.

675
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,141
THIS WILL BE A SHOCKER.

676
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,727
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT RIGHT
THERE.

677
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,437
"KEEP HOPE ALIVE" BABY.

678
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,399
THIS AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER.

679
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,627
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS A
TORCH.

680
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,921
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH AND
APPROACH THE FLAME.

681
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:30,591
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

682
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,386
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

683
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,431
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

684
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,474
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

685
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,438
WITH A SLIGHT EXCEPTION THIS
SEASON: REDEMPTION ISLAND.

686
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,649
SO, RALPH, FIRST TIME TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

687
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,819
>> WELL, IT'S GOOD AND IT'S BAD.

688
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,904
>> Jeff: WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT
COMING TO TRIBAL?

689
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:56,325
>> WELL, I WAS TOLD WE HAD TWO
PARTS IN OUR GAME.

690
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,619
>> Jeff: I'M LOST. TWO PARTS?

691
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,289
>> WE'VE GOT TWO TEAMS IN THE
SAME TEAM.

692
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,499
>> Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A
DIVISION WITHIN THE TRIBE.

693
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,126
>> YES, A DIVISION.

694
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,128
>> Jeff: STEVE, WAS IT QUICKLY

695
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,463
APPARENT WHO WAS JELLING WITH
WHO?

696
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,089
>> YES, IT WAS, JEFF.

697
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,633
THERE ARE SIX OF US THAT ARE
PRETTY ROCK SOLID, AND THEN

698
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,678
THERE'S ANOTHER THREE LED BY
RUSSELL.

699
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,973
>> Jeff: SERITA, WHAT CAUSED THE
DIVISION WITHIN THIS TRIBE?

700
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:23,644
>> I THINK IT WAS A LOT TO DO
WITH RUSSELL AND HIS LEGACY, AND

701
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,314
RUSSELL HAD GIVEN THIS GREAT
SPEECH ABOUT HOW HE WAS GOING TO

702
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,609
PLAY DIFFERENTLY AND THAT TURNED
OUT NOT TO BE THE CASE SO THERE

703
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,278
WAS A HUGE FISSURE IN THE TRIBE.

704
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,863
>> Jeff: RUSSELL YOU HAD TO KNOW

705
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,656
YOU WERE COMING IN HERE WITH A
TARGET?

706
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,326
>> JEFF, THE PROBLEM WITH ME
COMING HERE EVERYBODY PERCEIVES

707
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:44,165
ME AS THAT LEGACY WHERE I WOULD
TRY TO LOSE BY BURNING SOCKS,

708
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,333
POURING OUT WATER.

709
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,085
I AM NOT PLAYING THAT GAME.

710
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,172
I CAME IN TO WIN CHALLENGES, NOT
TO LOSE CHALLENGES.

711
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,299
AND, YOU KNOW, FROM WHERE I
STOOD, IT FELT TO ME THAT A LOT

712
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,551
OF PEOPLE GAVE UP IN THE
CHALLENGE.

713
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,719
>> Jeff: TODAY?

714
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:02,350
>> IT FELT THAT THEY THREW THE
CHALLENGE.

715
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,352
>> Jeff: MIKE, BIG ACCUSATION.

716
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,645
>> PRETTY BIG.

717
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,023
YOU KNOW, TODAY I WOULD SAY WE
DIDN'T GO 100%.

718
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:13,402
WE DEFINITELY WANTED TO WIN, BUT
IF WE LOST, WE GOT SOME FAT ON

719
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,030
THIS TRIBE WE NEED TO TRIM OFF.

720
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,033
>> Jeff: JULIE, HARD TO CONSIDER
GETTING RID OF SOMEBODY WHEN YOU

721
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,244
KNOW THAT IT IS ABOUT NUMBERS,
QUITE OFTEN?

722
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,579
>> PERSONALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO

723
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,373
MERGE WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS
POSSIBLE.

724
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,544
WEAK OR STRONG, WHETHER WE GET
ALONG OR NOT, I THINK WE NEED TO

725
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,880
GO INTO THE MERGE WITH NUMBERS.

726
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,715
>> Jeff: STEPHANIE, WHAT DO YOU
BELIEVE?

727
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,678
>> WELL, I THINK THE MAJORITY OF
THE TRIBE FORGET THAT THEY'RE IN

728
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,555
THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR."

729
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,014
THIS IS RUSSELL.

730
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,016
HE'S PLAYED THE GAME.

731
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,103
HE WOULD BE A HUGE PART OF
MOVING FORWARD.

732
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,938
HE'S DONE IT TWICE.

733
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,816
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THERE'S
GOING TO BE BACKSTABBING MADE,

734
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,401
SO IF YOU GUYS WANT TO BECOME

735
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,694
BEST FRIENDS RIGHT NOW, THAT'S
FINE.

736
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,114
BUT YOUR BEST FRIEND TO THE LEFT
OF YOU, TO THE RIGHT OF YOU, IS

737
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,074
GOING TO TURN AROUND AND STAB
YOU IN THE BACK BECAUSE YOU

738
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:00,908
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS.

739
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,410
>> WHAT SHE DOESN'T REALIZE
IS...

740
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,247
>> I'M STILL TALKING, MOUTH IS
STILL MOVING, THANK YOU.

741
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,291
>> FEISTY!
>> HAVING THE NUMBERS IN THE

742
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:12,295
MERGE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO TAKE
OVER THE OTHER TRIBE.

743
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,256
WE WERE TWO PEOPLE ABOVE THEM,
GUYS.

744
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,968
SO THROWING TODAY'S CHALLENGE IS
NOT STRATEGY.

745
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,096
IT'S PLAIN STUPIDITY.

746
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:24,390
THAT'S ALL.

747
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,894
>> Jeff: STEVE, GOING INTO A
MERGE, AN INCOHESIVE GROUP OF

748
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,770
NINE IS A MUCH BIGGER ADVANTAGE

749
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,439
THAN A TIGHT SIX DOWN AT THE
MERGE.

750
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,609
THAT'S THE POINT STEPHANIE'S
MAKING.

751
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,444
>> IT STUNK NOT WINNING TODAY.

752
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,779
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE SAYING
ABSOLUTELY NOT, YOU GUYS DID NOT

753
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,822
THROW THE CHALLENGE.

754
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,073
>> WE DID NOT THROW THE
CHALLENGE.

755
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,452
I WORKED MY TAIL OFF, AND I
THINK EVERYBODY ELSE DID, TOO.

756
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,789
>> Jeff: SO, DAVID, YOU GOT YOUR
ASS KICKED BY ROB HANDILY TODAY.

757
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,583
IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE.

758
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,918
>> ROB BEAT ME.

759
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,753
>> REALLY?

760
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,255
FOR ME IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE
SOMEONE WHO DOES PUZZLES...

761
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,299
>> SOMEBODY SHOULDN'T SPEAK FOR
ME ON THAT NOTE, ACTUALLY.

762
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,550
I TAKE A LITTLE EXCEPTION TO ALL
THIS.

763
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,344
JUST BECAUSE THE HANDS AREN'T
MOVING DOESN'T MEAN THE MIND

764
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,511
ISN'T WORKING.

765
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,473
>> OKAY.

766
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,310
>> Jeff: SERITA, IS PART OF WHAT
IS SCARY ABOUT RUSSELL IS YOU

767
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,354
JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING
TO SAY OR DO?

768
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,272
>> IT'S JUST A SICKNESS, ALMOST.

769
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,651
IT'S A HUGE BLACK CLOUD OVER
EVERYTHING WE DO.

770
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,361
HE DOES NOTHING AT CAMP...

771
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,698
>> WHAT'S THAT, STEPHANIE?

772
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,452
>> I REALLY CAN'T HEAR HER TO
SAY RUSSELL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

773
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,954
HE GETS FIREWOOD.

774
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,163
WE CATCH CRAB.

775
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,665
DON'T SAY HE DOESN'T DO
ANYTHING.

776
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,167
WAKE UP, OKAY?

777
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,795
>> Jeff: RALPH, YOU HAD A HUGE
REACTION.

778
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,797
>> HE WON'T CATCH THE FISH BUT

779
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,299
HE WILL EAT EVERY PIECE THAT IS
BROUGHT IN.

780
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,176
>> Jeff: I THINK YOU SAID SHE'S
NOT HELPING AT ALL

781
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,011
TO DO ANYTHING, CATCH FISH, BUT
EAT IT.

782
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,097
>> NO.

783
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,058
>> Jeff: WE'RE EARLY IN THE GAME
AND YOU GUYS ARE SO DIVIDED

784
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,977
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE COME A MERGE.

785
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,854
BIG PREDICTION FROM ME, BUT I
THINK I'M RIGHT.

786
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,232
SO, RUSSELL, WHAT DO YOU DO?

787
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,526
>> YOU KNOW, I NEVER STOP
PLAYING THIS GAME.

788
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,738
>> Jeff: YOU HAVE A NEW TATTOO
ON YOUR ARM, "KEEP HOPE ALIVE."

789
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,324
>> THAT'S ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW
IS HOPE.

790
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,534
FIRST TIME I PLAYED I WAS
IN TROUBLE.

791
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,996
SECOND TIME I PLAYED, I WAS IN
TROUBLE.

792
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,792
I KNOW WHAT THEY THINK, BUT IT
NEVER IS WHAT IT SEEMS.

793
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,714
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.

794
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,924
STEVE, YOU'RE UP.

795
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,029
>> I'M VOTING FOR YOU.

796
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,240
YOU ARE SO MISGUIDED AND SO
RUDE.

797
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,758
>> THIS IS MY GAME, SUCKER.

798
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,735
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

799
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,620
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

800
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,996
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

801
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,915
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

802
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,084
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

803
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,671
FIRST VOTE, RUSSELL.

804
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,718
RALPH.

805
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,472
STEPHANIE.

806
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,598
RUSSELL.

807
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,642
THAT'S TWO VOTES RUSSELL.

808
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,312
RUSSELL.

809
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:01,857
THAT'S THREE VOTES RUSSELL, ONE
VOTE RALPH, ONE VOTE STEPHANIE.

810
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,070
THAT'S TWO VOTES STEPHANIE,

811
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,696
THREE VOTES RUSSELL, ONE VOTE
RALPH.

812
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,867
RALPH.

813
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,454
TWO VOTES RALPH, TWO VOTES
STEPHANIE, THREE VOTES RUSSELL.

814
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,999
WE'RE TIED.

815
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,502
THREE VOTES RALPH, THREE VOTES
RUSSELL, TWO VOTES STEPHANIE,

816
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,546
ONE VOTE LEFT.

817
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,556
STEPHANIE.

818
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,183
WE HAVE A THREE-WAY TIE.

819
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,184
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

820
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,355
STEPHANIE, RUSSELL, RALPH, YOU
WILL NOT VOTE.

821
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,732
EVERYBODY ELSE WILL VOTE, AND
YOU CAN ONLY VOTE FOR RALPH,

822
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,986
RUSSELL, OR STEPHANIE.

823
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,988
STEVE, IF YOU'LL GRAB THIS.

824
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,679
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

825
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,189
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

826
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:29,653
FIRST VOTE, RALPH.

827
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,655
RUSSELL.

828
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,993
RUSSELL.

829
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,078
RUSSELL.

830
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,331
THREE VOTES RUSSELL, ONE VOTE
RALPH.

831
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,045
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: REDEMPTION ISLAND,"

832
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,755
RUSSELL.

833
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,923
THAT'S FOUR. THAT'S ENOUGH.

834
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,759
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

835
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,140
>> I'LL BE BACK AND BE READY.

836
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,184
>> I'LL BE READY.

837
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,189
>> Jeff: RUSSELL, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

838
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,903
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET
BACK IN THIS GAME.

839
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,863
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

840
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,168
>> Jeff: WELL, YOU JUST VOTED
OUT ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

841
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,587
PLAYERS IN THE HISTORY OF
"SURVIVOR."

842
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,800
THE QUESTION IS: WILL THIS
DECISION COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU?

843
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,677
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

844
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,887
GOOD NIGHT.

845
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,857
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

846
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:58,158
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":

847
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:58,742
PHIL'S ON THE HOT SEAT.

848
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,785
>> HE IS SO ANNOYING.

849
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,829
>> Jeff: BUT WITH THE HIDDEN

850
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,998
IMMUNITY IDOL IN PLAY, ANYTHING
CAN HAPPEN.

851
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,333
>> SOMEBODY WITHIN MY ALLIANCE
MIGHT FLIP.

852
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,836
>> Jeff: AND AT REDEMPTION
ISLAND, IT'S TIME FOR RUSSELL TO

853
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,462
PUT UP OR SHUT UP.

854
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,048
>> THIS WAS THE REAL WORLD, I'D
BE ROOTING FOR MATT.

855
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,091
BUT IT'S NOT.

856
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,135
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

857
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,808
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE
EVER BEEN VOTED OUT.

858
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,852
I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

859
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,186
I WAS PISSED OFF.

860
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,314
I WANTED TO BITCH-SLAP EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

861
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,069
>> RUSSELL!

862
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,698
>> RIGHT NOW THIS IS HIS HOUSE.

863
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,034
I'M ABOUT TO TAKE IT FROM HIM.
