>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:05,088
"SURVIVOR": WITH 11 PEOPLE STILL

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,090
IN THE GAME, EACH HAD THEIR OWN

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:07,298
AGENDA.

5
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,426
JEREMY WAS FINDING IDOLS.

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,094
>> TOOK ME TWO YEARS BUT NOW

7
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,053
I'VE GOT TWO IDOLS.

8
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,974
>> Jeff: CIERA WAS USING

9
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:16,933
VOTING BLOCKS TO STAY ALIVE.

10
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:18,893
>> ARE WE TALKING STRATEGY AT

11
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:19,060
ALL?

12
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,270
WE NEED TO MAKE A MOVE BEFORE

13
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,730
IT'S TOO LATE.

14
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,230
>> Jeff: AND STEPHEN WAS

15
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,565
TARGETING BIG THREATS.

16
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,190
>> I NEED JOE OUT.

17
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,234
>> Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

18
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,068
CHALLENGE-- FIRST PERSON TO

19
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,279
TOUCH THEIR BUOY EARNS AN

20
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,114
ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME.

21
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,532
STEPHEN GAINED AN ADVANTAGE.

22
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,659
>> THIS IS BEYOND MY WILDEST

23
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:34,909
DREAMS.

24
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,954
>> Jeff: AND JOE CONTINUED TO

25
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:38,204
DOMINATE.

26
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,999
JOE WINS HIS THIRD INDIVIDUAL

27
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:41,291
IMMUNITY.

28
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,626
BACK AT CAMP, CIERA, WENTWORTH,

29
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,295
AND ABY WERE ON THE BOTTOM.

30
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,171
>> WE'LL WRITE DOWN WHATEVER YOU

31
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,339
TELL US TO WRITE DOWN.

32
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,549
>> THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO

33
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,676
TRULY SHIFT THE GAME ON ITS HEAD

34
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,179
IS THERE BUT HE NEEDED JEREMY

35
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,639
AND SPENCER TO FURN ON THEIR

36
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:56,848
ALLIES.

37
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,099
>> PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME BACK

38
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,267
TO CAMP BLINDSIDED.

39
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,436
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL THE

40
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,353
GUYS FLIPPED.

41
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,271
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT, THE

42
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,441
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

43
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:10,945
BLINDSIDING JOE AND HIS CLOSEST

44
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,488
ALLY.

45
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,072
KELLEY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

46
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,533
>> YES, THEY HAVE.

47
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,368
>> Jeff: WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT

48
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:29,380
TONIGHT?

49
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,008
>> SO AT TRIBAL TONIGHT,

50
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:36,012
STEPHEN, SPENCER, AND MYSELF

51
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,388
BLINDSIDED KELLY WIGLESWORTH.

52
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,098
I STILL THINK WE COULD JUMP BACK

53
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,266
TO OUR POWER GROUP, OR WHATEVER

54
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,226
WE WANT TO CALL IT, AND TAKE OUT

55
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:44,270
ANOTHER ONE OF THE GIRLS.

56
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,188
MAYBE CIERA CAN GO.

57
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,899
>> EVERY VOTE, IF I CAN'T CLEAN

58
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:48,525
UP, THEY'RE GOING TO COME AFTER

59
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,692
ME NEXT.

60
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,736
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO

61
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,154
COME RIGHT BACK AND TALK TO

62
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:53,363
TASHA.

63
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,156
I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BE

64
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,241
UPSET.

65
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,117
>> WE COULDN'T TELL YOU.

66
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,745
WE COULDN'T TELL YOU.

67
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,914
ALL RIGHT?

68
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,999
>> SO THEY LEFT ME OUT OF THE

69
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:05,208
VOTE.

70
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,292
BUT IN THE VOTING BLOCK

71
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,002
SITUATION, IT'S LIKE ONCE YOU

72
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,838
HAVE THE NUMBERS FOR YOUR BLOCK,

73
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,172
YOU DON'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE.

74
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,550
THAT IS THE GAME THAT WE'RE

75
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:13,800
PLAYING.

76
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,219
>> YOU'RE STILL IN THE POWER.

77
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:16,511
ALL RIGHT?

78
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,681
>> YOU GET ONE OPPORTUNITY TO

79
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,223
LEAVE ME OUT OF THE LOOP.

80
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,268
THAT WAS THEIR ONE OPPORTUNITY.

81
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:27,522
THEY DON'T GET ANY MORE CHANCES.

82
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,524
>> SO WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?

83
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,443
>> SHE-- SHE WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

84
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,319
SHE'S, LIKE, IN EVERYONE'S

85
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,073
BUSINESS ALL THE TIME.

86
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,243
>> YEAH... I'M PRETTY ( BLEEP )

87
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:40,618
PISSED RIGHT NOW.

88
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,246
AND I'M TRYING TO KEEP IT

89
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,374
TOGETHER AND NOT LOSE MY

90
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:46,624
( BLEEP ).

91
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,586
>> SO WHO ALL VOTED FOR

92
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:49,878
WIGLESWORTH?

93
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,295
>> US.

94
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,922
THREE GIRLS.

95
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,133
>> I VOTED CIERA.

96
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:55,425
NO WORRIES.

97
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,218
I'M STILL HERE SO I'M GLAD ABOUT

98
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:57,427
THAT.

99
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,471
AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

100
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,347
>> LET'S JUST NOT LET THOSE

101
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,599
GIRLS GET--

102
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,100
>> NO, COME ON.

103
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:04,517
NO WAY.

104
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,435
>> WE ALL KNOW WHERE THEY'RE AT.

105
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,313
>> ONE OF MY BIGGEST ALLIES IN

106
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,441
THE GAME WENT HOME, SO ALL THE

107
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,192
MORE REASON FOR ME TO WIN THE

108
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,527
NEXT IMMUNITY.

109
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,529
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COMING FOR

110
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,614
ME.

111
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,561
>> THIS SUCKS.

112
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,355
>> I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT

113
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,273
WOULD BE LIKE THIS WITHOUT A

114
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:52,482
BREAK.

115
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,399
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A PRETTY

116
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,443
DECENT SPOT RIGHT NOW IN THE

117
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:55,652
GAME.

118
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,404
YOU KNOW, I WAS ON THE BOTTOM

119
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,867
WITH WENTWORTH AND ABI AND

120
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,493
SLOWLY I STARTED TO CREEP MY WAY

121
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,621
UP A LITTLE BIT AND HOPEFULLY I

122
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,915
CAN KEEP THE MOMENTUM.

123
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:13,670
THIS RAIN IS A BITCH.

124
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,505
WE'RE ALL STUCK INSIDE THE

125
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:15,755
SHELTER.

126
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,756
THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

127
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,300
>> SEE I TOLD YOU, FIRST IT WAS

128
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,679
THUNDER AND THEN COMES

129
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:22,929
LIGHTNING.

130
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,180
>> CAN WE EAT DRY RICE?

131
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:24,514
>> I'M ABOUT TO.

132
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,515
>> THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT FOOD

133
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,976
AND COLD AND ALL THAT, BUT I'M

134
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,644
HERE TO WIN A MILLION DOLLARS

135
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,104
CUT AND DRIED.

136
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,313
I AIN'T STARVING TO DEATH.

137
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:32,647
I'LL MAKE IT.

138
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,356
THIS IS DAY 25.

139
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,275
LET'S SEE, 35.

140
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,486
YEAH, I'M TWO WEEKS OUT.

141
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,404
I'LL SIT HERE FOR 50 DAYS FOR A

142
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,781
MILLION DOLLARS.

143
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,491
I MEAN, DANG.

144
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,743
WHEN DO YOU GET A SECOND CHANCE

145
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,286
FOR SOMETHING CRAZY LIKE THIS?

146
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,330
( LAUGHS )

147
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:49,539
DANG.

148
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,331
THAT LOOKS BAD.

149
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,209
I FEEL LIKE ANY MINUTE I COULD

150
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,627
LOSE A TOE.

151
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,338
PEOPLE ASK ME IF "SURVIVOR" IS

152
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:57,505
FUN.

153
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,341
I TELL THEM, HELL NO.

154
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,051
IT AIN'T FUN.

155
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,012
GOING ON A CRUISE IS FUN.

156
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,304
GOING FISHING IT FUN.

157
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,848
GOING TO PLAY GOLF IS FUN.

158
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:07,348
THIS AIN'T FUN.

159
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,725
LOOK AT ME.

160
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:19,402
GOLLY!

161
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:29,704
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

162
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,499
>> Jeff: TASH, TELL ME WHERE

163
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,668
THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE, THESE

164
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,003
HUMANS ARE AT EMOTIONALLY?

165
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,297
>> WE'RE EXHAUSTED.

166
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,381
THE WEATHER DEFINITELY TAKES THE

167
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,507
ENERGY OUT OF YOU.

168
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,426
IT'S CRAZY THE LEVEL OF EFFORT

169
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,262
THAT EACH OF US ARE PUTTING INTO

170
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:46,554
THIS, JEFF.

171
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,556
>> Jeff: AND YET, CIERA, YOU

172
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,474
CAN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A HIGH IS

173
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,684
IF THERE'S NOT A LOW TO COMPARE

174
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:51,893
IT TO.

175
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:55,813
THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE

176
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,064
MEANING.

177
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,023
>> I THINK WHEN WE HAVE A

178
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:57,607
LITTLE, SWEET MOMENT, NO RAIN

179
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,902
FOR 10 MINUTES, IS SO AWESOME,

180
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,445
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THESE LOWS ARE

181
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:02,653
SO LOW.

182
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,780
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S

183
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,031
FLIP IT TODAY AND LET ME TELL

184
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,824
YOU WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING FOR

185
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,201
FIRST, AND YOU CAN TELL ME

186
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,911
HONESTLY IF YOU THINK IT'S WORTH

187
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:10,078
IT.

188
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,370
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, WE'RE

189
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,747
GOING TO DIVIDE INTO TWO TEAMS

00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,698
>> HAVING BEEN WET FOR TWO DAYS

379
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,575
STRAIGHT, GOING ON A REWARD HAS

380
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:10,247
NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT.

381
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,916
AND GET ALL THIS CAMBODIAN

382
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,542
CULTURE THAT I'VE NEVER

383
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,168
EXPERIENCED, AND THE OPPORTUNITY

384
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,628
TO FORM THE BONDS YOU NEED TO

385
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,963
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

386
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:18,172
WHOOO!

387
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,008
IT MIGHT THE BE IMMUNITY BUT IT

388
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,551
FEELS AS IMPORTANT AS IMMUNITY.

389
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,472
>> YEAH!

390
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,184
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

391
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,852
>> THAT LITTLE BOY IS IS, LIKE

392
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,146
THE EXACT SIZE OF MINE.

393
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,898
>> YOUR LITTLE SON IS THAT

394
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,106
LITTLE?

395
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,941
>> A LITTLE BIT BIGGER.

396
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,235
>> OH, MY GOSH, SO CUTE.

397
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:39,985
>> THE COOLEST THING FOR ME IS

398
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,738
TO BE ABLE TO SEE ALL THE

399
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,364
FAMILIES AND ALL THE KIDS WATCH

400
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,740
THIS PERFORMANCE.

401
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,534
IT DEFINITELY MADE ME MISS MY

402
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:46,951
HOME MORE THAN EVER.

403
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,537
>> HOW YOU DOING, GIRL?

404
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,913
>> IT'S JUST SEEING ALL THESE

405
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,624
KIDS, AND IT JUST MAKES ME MISS

406
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,667
MY BABIES.

407
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,918
I'M REALLY, REALLY, REALLY

408
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,336
STARTING TO MISS MY KIDS AND MY

409
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,921
HUSBAND, AND I THINK IT JUST PUT

410
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,005
INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR ME THEY'RE

411
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,508
FINE, AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

412
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,134
AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO KEEP

413
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,636
TRUCKING ALONG FOR THEM.

414
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,095
ALMOST DONE, RIGHT?

415
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,346
>> ALMOST DONE.

416
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,598
>> ALMOST THERE.

417
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,851
>> SO I NEED TO TAKE ANY

418
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,852
ADVANTAGE I CAN GET.

419
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,771
THIS GAME IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING

420
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,189
SO THIS REWARD IS THE PERFECT

421
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,482
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SAY

422
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,817
SAYILY," LET'S MAKE A PLAN."

423
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,193
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 10 OF US AND

424
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,069
WE ONLY NEED SIX.

425
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,113
WHY DO WE NEED JEREMY, STEPHEN,

426
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,072
OR KIMMI.

427
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,448
>> STEPHEN'S ADVANTAGE IS SCARY.

428
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,033
>> THAT'S WHY HE NEEDS TO BE

429
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,034
TOTALLY BLINDSIDED.

430
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,703
>> STEPHEN IS A HUGE THREAT, AND

431
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,287
HE JUST GOT THIS ADVANTAGE.

432
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,789
EVEN MORE OF A REASON TO

433
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:34,957
BLINDSIDE HIM AND GET HIM OUT OF

434
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,124
HERE.

435
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,959
>> I THINK STEPHEN IS THE MOST

436
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,502
DANGEROUS PLAYER IN THE GAME

437
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,044
RIGHT NOW.

438
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,754
>> LET'S GET RID OF STEPHEN.

439
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,130
>> DONE.

440
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,132
CIERA PITCHED THIS IDEA THAT US

441
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,051
FIVE AT THE REWARD SHOULD

442
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:46,635
BLINDSIDE STEPHEN.

443
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,596
I'VE WANTED STEPHEN OUT FOR A

444
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:48,804
WHILE.

445
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:49,972
IT SOUNDS LOOK A GOOD PLAN, BUT

446
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,600
I CAN'T BANK ON THEM, ESPECIALLY

447
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,225
WHEN I KNOW THEY WANT ME OUT OF

448
00:14:53,309 --> 00:15:09,658
THIS GAME.

449
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,121
>> WE'VE JUST GOT TO PUSH

450
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:14,330
THROUGH.

451
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,165
THIS SUCTION, BUT JUST PUSH

452
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:16,373
THROUGH.

453
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,502
>> I KNOW.

454
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,754
MY SON WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR

455
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,048
49 DAYS, AND I SAT THERE THROUGH

456
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,883
THAT.

457
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,051
>> THAT IS WORSE THAN THIS.

458
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,011
>> THAT WAS 1,000 TIMES WORSE

459
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,596
THAN THIS.

460
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,931
MY OLDEST SON HAS KIDNEY DISEASE

461
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,516
AND WHEN YOU SIT AND PUT THINGS

462
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,934
IN PERSPECTIVE, IF HE CAN DO

463
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,102
THAT, THEN I CAN CERTAINLY

464
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,355
ENDURE THESE ELEMENTS OF

465
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,481
"SURVIVOR," BECAUSE ALL MY

466
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,900
STRENGTH FOR BEING OUT HERE

467
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,027
COMES FROM MY BOYS.

468
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,321
>> IS THAT YOUR SHIRT?

469
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,739
>> JOE'S.

470
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,908
>> I THOUGHT OF PUTTING IT ON,

471
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:51,075
TOO.

472
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,826
SO, GOOD.

473
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,621
>> THE HELL WITH JOE.

474
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,747
I'M STAYING WARM.

475
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,373
>> IT WAS TOUGH TODAY BECAUSE,

476
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,083
YOU KNOW, KEITH IS FIGHTING TWO

477
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,000
PEOPLE AT ONCE.

478
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,336
AND THEN JOE IS JUST PUSHING TWO

479
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,045
GIRLS DOWN.

480
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,880
>> WE TRIED!

481
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:05,547
WE TRIED.

482
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,965
>> HE'S THE BIGGEST GUY OUT HERE

483
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,510
BY A MILE.

484
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,220
YOU'D BE WINNING ALL THESE

485
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,930
REWARDS, JEREMY, IF HE WASN'T IN

486
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:13,222
THE GAME.

487
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,015
>> JOE IS A BIG THREAT.

488
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:15,516
>> JOE IS A BIG THREAT.

489
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,435
>> IT WOULDN'T BOTHER ME A BIT

490
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,228
IF JOE GOES.

491
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,562
HE'S GOOD AT CHALLENGES.

492
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,939
HE'S WINNING EVERYTHING OUT

493
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,231
HERE.

494
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,482
THAT'S KNOT TO STOP.

495
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,485
EITHER BY ME, JEREMY, SPENCER,

496
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,195
SOMEBODY, GIVE OF REST OF THE

497
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,280
LOW PACK A CHANCE OR SOMETHING.

498
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,657
>> EVERYONE WANTS JOE GONE.

499
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,492
>> HONESTLY, THE THING IS WITH

500
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,828
JOE, HE MADE HIS OWN BED.

501
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,246
LIKE, YOU CAN'T KEEP WINNING

502
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,290
IMMUNITIES LIKE THAT.

503
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,083
LET'S JUST GET JOE OUT OF HERE.

504
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,961
THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE FOR SO

505
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,546
MANY DAYS IN THIS GAME, I'VE

506
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,047
JUST FELT, LIKE, ON THE BOTTOM,

507
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,676
BUT I FEEL LIKE THESE VOTING

508
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,219
BLOCKS DEFINITELY OPENED UP A

509
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,263
LOT OF DOORS FOR CIERA, ABI, AND

510
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:54,471
MYSELF.

511
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,016
>> HE'S PLAYING EVERY SIDE,

512
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,309
UNDERSIDE, INSIDE, OUTSIDE.

513
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,644
>> HE'S PLAYING EVERY PERSON BUT

514
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,186
IN A REALLY ARROGANT WAY.

515
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,146
>> YES.

516
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,065
FINALLY WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME

517
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:05,274
PAGE.

518
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:05,899
EVERYONE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT IT

519
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,151
IS THAT JOE DOESN'T WIN

520
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:07,443
IMMUNITY.

521
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,068
>> I'M READY FOR HIM TO GO.

522
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,195
>> IT'S TIME.

523
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:10,946
>> I'M READY.

524
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,323
>> HE'S HAD HIS STORY.

525
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,867
I'M LITERALLY SHIVERING.

526
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,535
IT IS FREEZING OUT HERE.

527
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,161
IT'S MISERABLE.

528
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,954
BUT I THINK I'VE GOT MY FINGERS

529
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,581
IN BASICALLY EVERY POT RIGHT

530
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,040
NOW, AND ESPECIALLY WINNING THAT

531
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,042
GAME ADVANTAGE, I THINK I'M IN A

532
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:24,877
REALLY GREAT POSITION RIGHT NOW.

533
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,921
I MEAN, NEVER SAY THAT ON

534
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:28,881
"SURVIVOR" THAT YOU'RE IN A

535
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,008
GREAT POSITION BECAUSE THAT'S--

536
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,718
THAT'S THE DEATH KNELL.

537
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,844
THAT'S WHEN YOU GO HOME.

538
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,970
BUT I THINK MOVING FORWARD I

539
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:35,763
HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO MANEUVER

540
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:41,185
IN THIS GAME.

541
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:48,067
( THUNDER )

542
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,595
>> IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

543
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,805
FREEZING CODE RAIN, WE'VE BEEN

544
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,388
WET FOR DAYS, I HAVEN'T EATEN

545
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,642
FOR DAYS, AND SUDDENLY I START

546
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,226
HAVING TERRIBLE STOMACH ISSUES

547
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,352
AND IT TAKES ME OUT OF THE

548
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,145
SHELTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

549
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:31,109
MONSOON OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

550
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:31,401
>> POOR GUY.

551
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,320
>> EVERYONE IS MISERABLE.

552
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,489
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE IS AT THEIR

553
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,783
LOW, BUT I'M SCARED THAT MY BODY

554
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,408
IS BREAKING DOWN.

555
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,077
I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS.

556
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,000
LITERALLY, I JUST CAN'T.

557
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,168
LIKE, EVEN THOUGH YOUR BODY

558
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,004
CAN'T, STILL HAVE TO SAY, "YES,

559
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,174
YES I CAN" YOU KNOW, "YES I

560
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:54,591
WILL."

561
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,509
I'M JUST EXHAUSTED.

562
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,426
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS I'VE

563
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,095
BEEN DOWN, I'VE BEEN DOWN AND

564
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:58,303
DOWN.

565
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:58,971
I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL END.

566
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,414
>> THE RAIN HAS BEEN GOING FOR

567
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:25,581
DAYS.

568
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,707
MY STOMACH IS REALLY SUFFERING.

569
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,042
EVERY PART OF ME IS JUST, LIKE,

570
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,002
GIVEN UP.

571
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,337
I JUST NEED SOME, LIKE, SOME,

572
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,674
LIKE, RAY OF HOPE YOU KNOW.

573
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,010
JUST, LIKE, THE SUN TO COME OUT

574
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,763
FOR 15 MINUTES OR SOMETHING.

575
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,143
( THUNDER )

576
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,144
I'M NOT QUITTING.

577
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,353
I'M NOT QUITTING.

578
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,399
THERE'S NO WAY I'M QUITTING.

579
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,402
I'M NOT QUITTING.

580
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,237
I GOTTA GO AGAIN.

581
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,699
I JUST WENT 30 SECONDS AGO.

582
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:05,245
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

583
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,997
>> STEPHEN DOES NOT LOOK GOOD.

584
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,998
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

585
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,417
HIS STOMACH IS MESSED UP, AND

586
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,544
HIS FEET ARE SWOLLEN.

587
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,712
HE LOOKS SO BAD.

588
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,755
HE LOOKS SO BAD.

589
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,506
I'M HOPING HE'S OKAY BECAUSE I

590
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,175
NEED SOME LOYALTY AROUND ME, AND

591
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,469
STEPHEN IS AN HONEST GUY.

592
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,179
>> WHAT'S UP.

593
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:22,971
YOUR FOOT?

594
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,973
WHY ARE YOU LIMPING AROUND.

595
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,099
>> I'M JUST A MESS.

596
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,893
>> I LOVE "SURVIVOR," BUT IT'S A

597
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:28,852
TOUGH GAME.

598
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,394
EVERY DAY, IT'S TOUGH.

599
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,270
WE'RE FREEZING.

600
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,231
THE WIND IS COLD.

601
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,691
AND THE SHELTER IS HORRIBLE.

602
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,818
IT DOESN'T HOLD UP AGAINST THE

603
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,487
ELEMENTS OUT HERE PUP CAN'T EVER

604
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,781
GET WARM, SO WE'RE JUST HUDDLED

605
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:41,323
UP TOGETHER.

606
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:41,615
IT SUCTION.

607
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,282
WE NEED SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.

608
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,284
IF WE CAN GET WARM AND GET

609
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,453
EVERYTHING DRY FOR ONE DAY,

610
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:51,083
WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

611
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:04,471
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

612
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:12,854
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, BEFORE WE

613
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:19,194
GET TO THE CHALLENGE, I WANT

614
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,154
EACH OF YOU TO TAKE ONE BLACK

615
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:21,613
ROCK, ONE WHITE ROCK.

616
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:26,952
TAKE ONE OF EACH.

617
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,495
YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD, KEITH.

618
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,122
>> I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT WE

619
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,832
GOT UP NEXT.

620
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,792
>> WHEN JEFF GAVE US THE WHITE

621
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,919
AND BLACK ROCK, OUR HEADS WERE

622
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:36,920
ALL SPINNING.

623
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:37,713
WHAT COULD THIS BE?

624
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,380
JEFF HAD SOMETHING UP HIS

625
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:38,630
SLEEVES.

626
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,172
>> Jeff: WE'LL GET TO THE

627
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,757
STONES LATER.

628
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,384
ALL RIGHT, SHALL WE GET TO

629
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,385
TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

630
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,553
>> YEAH.

631
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,179
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

632
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:52,686
JOE, GOTTA TAKE IT BACK AGAIN.

633
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,522
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

634
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:55,772
FOR GRABS.

635
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,941
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

636
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,610
GOING TO BALANCE ON ONE FOOT ON

637
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,696
A SMALL BLOCK WHILE BALANCING A

638
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,114
BALL AGAINST AN OVERHANGING

639
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:04,948
PIECE OF WOOD.

640
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,451
IF AT ANY POINT THE BALL DROPS,

641
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,244
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

642
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,413
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS

643
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,415
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A

644
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,751
ONE-IN-NINE SHOT AT WINNING THIS

645
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,543
GAME.

646
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,336
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE

647
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,171
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE FOURTH

648
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,172
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

649
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,549
WE'VE DONE THIS CHALLENGE ONE

650
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:22,758
TIME.

651
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,592
KEITH'S SEASON.

652
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,427
KEITH PARTICIPATED AND DID NOT

653
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,594
WIN.

654
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,429
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS FOR THE

655
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,516
FIRST TIME IN A FEW DAYS, WE

656
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,517
HAVE CLEAR WEATHER.

657
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,187
FISHBACH, HOW BAD HAS IT BEEN?

658
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,105
>> IT'S BEEN TERRIBLE.

659
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,190
WE HAVEN'T EATEN IN DAYS.

660
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,524
WE HAVEN'T BEEN DRY IN DAYS.

661
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,650
AND I ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF

662
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,445
THE NIGHT LAST NIGHT HAD SEVERE

663
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,572
GASTRO INTESTINAL DISTRESS-- YOU

664
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,493
CAN HASHTAG THAT.

665
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,163
IT FELT LIKE I WAS GOING FROM A

666
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:53,747
"SURVIVOR" LOW TO A PERSONAL

667
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,748
LIFE LOW.

668
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,666
>> Jeff: YOU GUY STILL HAVE

669
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,835
HALF A MONTH TO GO OUT HERE.

670
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,169
>> THANK GOD.

671
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,754
>> Jeff: I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU

672
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,339
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GREATLY

673
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,840
IMPROVE YOUR SHELTER. NOT WHAT

674
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,258
YOU WERE EXPECTING, IS IT?

675
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:05,467
>> NOPE.

676
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,885
>> Jeff: RIGHT NOW, A

677
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,929
CONSTRUCTION CREW IS AT YOUR

678
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:09,137
CAMP.

679
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,430
THEY ARE READY TO REDO YOUR

680
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:10,639
SHELTER.

681
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,517
>> OH, MY GOSH!

682
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,560
>> Jeff: WE WILL WATERPROOF

683
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,062
THE ROOF.

684
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,355
WE WILL GET YOUR FIRE GOING IN

685
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,065
THE CENTER.

686
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:20,482
IT WILL BE COVERED.

687
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,566
>> OH, MY GOSH.

688
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,946
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US?

689
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,324
>> Jeff: I WANT FIVE PEOPLE TO

690
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,910
GIVE UP THEIR SHOT AT IMMUNITY

691
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:36,164
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

692
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,750
>> OH, MY GOSH.

693
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,836
>> WE HAVE A DILEMMA BETWEEN I

694
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,545
AND WE.

695
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,922
THIS DECISION COULD EASILY BITE

696
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,216
YOU IN THE ASS, WHICHEVER WAY

697
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:46,550
YOU GO.

698
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,427
>> Jeff: WHITE ROCK MEANS I AM

699
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,888
WILLING TO SURRENDER MY SHOT IN

700
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,639
THIS CHALLENGE.

701
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,641
I WILL GIVE UP FOR THE BETTER OF

702
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,393
THE GROUP.

703
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,895
THE BLACK ROCK MEANS CAN'T DO

704
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,187
IT.

705
00:23:59,271 --> 00:23:59,980
I'M COMPETING.

706
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,064
I WANT IMMUNITY.

707
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,025
SO THIS REALLY COMES DOWN TO

708
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,360
TRUST BECAUSE IF YOU COULD ALL

709
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,653
TRUST EACH OTHER, THIS IS EASY.

710
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,488
FIVE PEOPLE DO IT, IMPROVE YOUR

711
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,281
SHELTER.

712
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:09,489
DONE.

713
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,576
BUT THIS IS A GAME FOR A MILLION

714
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:12,909
DOLLARS.

715
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,577
>> SURVIVING IS MORE IMPORTANT

716
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,620
THAN INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, BUT MY

717
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,080
MIND IS JUST RACING WITH ALL

718
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:17,622
THESE QUESTIONS.

719
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,999
WHO I DO THINK IS GOING TO GIVE

720
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:19,624
UP ONE FOR THE TEAM AND WHO DO I

721
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,669
THINK IS GOING TO COMPETE IN THE

722
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:22,919
CHALLENGE?

723
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:23,587
>> Jeff: MAKE YOUR DECISION.

724
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:32,345
PUT YOUR PALM OUT.

725
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,763
WHITE MEANS I'M GIVING UP.

726
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,308
I'M LOOKING FOR FIVE WHITES.

727
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:42,480
EVERYBODY REVEAL.

728
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,648
EVERYBODY WILLING TO GIVE UP

729
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,649
THEIR SHOT EXCEPT FOR JOE AND

730
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:44,858
KEITH.

731
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,525
>> COME ON!

732
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,778
>> Jeff: SPENCER, FISHBACH,

733
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,781
JEREMY, KIMMI, WENTWORTH, CIERA,

734
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,408
ABI, AND TASHA, ALL SAID I WILL

735
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:57,370
GIVE UP MY SHOT AT SECURITY IN A

736
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:57,996
MILLION-DOLLAR GAME WITH ONLY 10

737
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,164
PEOPLE LEFT.

738
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,332
GOOD NEWS IS, WHEN YOU GO BACK

739
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:04,002
TO CAMP, YOU WILL HAVE A BIG

740
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:04,252
SHELTER.

741
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,462
THE MORE INTERESTING NEWS, TWO

742
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,172
PEOPLE SAID NOT DOING IT.

743
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,757
JOE AND KEITH.

744
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,050
KEITH, DID YOU DEBATE THIS OR

745
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,218
WAS IT EASY?

746
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,094
>> I'M A COMPETITOR, AND I

747
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:13,887
WANTED TO PLAY.

748
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,640
I KIND OF FIGURED JOE WAS IN

749
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:16,848
THERE.

750
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,433
I WANT TO WIN THAT NECKLACE

751
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:18,725
RIGHT THERE.

752
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,935
>> Jeff: JOE, DID YOU CONSIDER

753
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,101
IT?

754
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:20,644
>> I TOTALLY CONSIDERED IT.

755
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,729
I WAS BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND

756
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,398
FORTH, AND FOR A SPLIT SECOND I

757
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,650
SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK THE

758
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,276
RAIN AFFECTS MORE PEOPLE HERE,

759
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,362
LIKE ME, PERSONALLY, I CAN SUCK

760
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,696
IT UP.

761
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,616
>> Jeff: BIG DECISION IN A BIG

762
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,742
GAME OF "SURVIVOR: SECOND

763
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:35,951
CHANCE."

764
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,161
THOSE OF YOU WHO SURRENDERED,

765
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,329
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

766
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,872
JOE AND KEITH, TAKE YOUR SPOTS,

767
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,709
WE'LL GET STARTED.

768
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,173
ALL RIGHT, EIGHT PEOPLE GAVE UP

769
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,342
THEIR SHOT AT IMMUNITY TO

770
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,635
IMPROVE THE SHELTER.

771
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,595
JOE AND KEITH ARE GOING TO

772
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,555
BATTLE IT OUT FOR IMMUNITY.

773
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,268
YOU HAVE ONE FOOT ON THE BLOCK.

774
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,270
YOU'RE BALANCING THE BALL IN

775
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,605
BETWEEN YOUR BOWIE AND THE

776
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,690
OVERHANGING PIECE OF WOOD.

777
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,525
JOE LOOKS GOOD.

778
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,317
KEITH LOOKS GOOD.

779
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,569
THIS CHALLENGE FOR IMMUNITY IS

780
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,739
ON.

781
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,117
KEITH HAS DONE THIS CHALLENGE.

782
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,704
HE ACTUALLY MADE IT FAIRLY DEEP.

783
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,415
DIDN'T WIN.

784
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,041
JOE, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS NOT

785
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,626
LOST AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

786
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,838
HE IS THREE FOR THREE.

787
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,674
NOBODY HAS FELT THAT NECKLACE

788
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,843
OTHER THAN JOE.

789
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,386
YOU BOTH MADE BIG DECISIONS WHEN

790
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,221
YOU DECIDED TO COMPETE.

791
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,472
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT WORTH IT.

792
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,851
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO

793
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,018
WIN.

794
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,603
IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE

795
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,856
FATIGUE TO START TO SET IN.

796
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,233
THE QUESTION IS WHO CAN STAND

797
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:54,821
THEM THE LONGEST?

798
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,240
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE EVERYTHING

799
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:05,206
YOU TWO HAVE TO OUTLAST THE

800
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,373
OTHER.

801
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:05,874
JOE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF

802
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,961
MOVEMENT.

803
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:10,754
WHEN YOU'RE AS TIRED AS YOU GUYS

804
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,839
ARE, IT'S SO EASY TO HAVE A

805
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:18,219
LAPSE IN YOUR CONCENTRATION.

806
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:26,895
>> JOE IS SLIPPING.

807
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,063
>> Jeff: KEITH WITH A TINY BIT

808
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:33,735
OF MOVEMENT.

809
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,445
KEITH DROPS OUT OF THE

810
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:35,737
CHALLENGE.

811
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,656
JOE WINS HIS FOURTH INDIVIDUAL

812
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,909
IMMUNITY, REMAINS UNDEFEATED.

813
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,203
NO SECOND CHANCE REDEMPTION FOR

814
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,954
KEITH.

815
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:45,872
JOE, COME ON OVER.

816
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:51,711
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

817
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,213
FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN THIS GAME

818
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,298
THE ONLY PERSON TO WIN

819
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,674
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY ONCE AGAIN,

820
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,218
JOE, SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

821
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,511
COUNCIL, CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF

822
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,095
THIS GAME.

823
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,098
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY

824
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:03,390
GOING HOME.

825
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,266
WILL IT BE ONE OF THE EIGHT OF

826
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,060
YOU WHO VOLUNTARILY GAVE UP YOUR

827
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:07,727
SHOT AT IMMUNITY?

828
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,438
ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE-- IT

829
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,981
WON'T BE YOU.

830
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:12,357
CONGRATULATIONS.

831
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:12,690
>> THANK YOU.

832
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,484
>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF.

833
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,360
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

834
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:15,902
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

835
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,614
>> OF COURSE, JOEY AMAZING, WINS

836
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:19,989
ANOTHER IMMUNITY.

837
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,117
AT LEAST NOW, HAVING THE

838
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,743
SHELTER, BEING DRY, SUDDENLY WE

839
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,787
CAN NOW PLAY AGAIN.

840
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,080
AND MY THOUGHT RIGHT NOW IS

841
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,748
MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO TAKE OUT

842
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:28,957
CIERA.

843
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,543
SHE'S SO FIXATED ON AGGRESSIVE

844
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,877
GAME PLAY BECAUSE SHE KNOWS

845
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,380
SHE'S IN TROUBLE WHICH IS

846
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,047
TERRIFYING.

847
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:04,325
>> WHEN WE CAME BACK TO CAMP AND

848
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,202
WE SAW THE SHELTER BUILT, THE

849
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,954
FIRE GOING, IT WAS JUST SUCH AN

850
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,622
AMAZING FEELING.

851
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,374
IT WAS JUST LIKE, WOW.

852
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,877
I CAN ENDURE ANOTHER 13 DAYS, NO

853
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,127
PROBLEM.

854
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,129
>> THIS IS AMAZING!

855
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,005
>> BEST SHELTER EVER.

856
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,715
>> YOU GUYS, LOOK AT THIS

857
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:18,965
SHELTER.

858
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,841
>> I KNOW.

859
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,341
>> THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

860
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,593
>> WE WILL BE WARM.

861
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,886
>> THIS WENT FROM ONE OF THE

862
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,846
LOWEST POINTS OF ALL OF OUR

863
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,432
LIVES TO THE MOST INCREDIBLE

864
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,392
SHELTER, BUT WHEN YOU GIVE UP

865
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,478
POTENTIALLY YOUR LIFE IN THE

866
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,353
GAME, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SELLING

867
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,063
YOUR SOUL TO THE DEVIL.

868
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,231
>> ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS

869
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,108
TAKE DOWN THE GOLDEN BOY.

870
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,319
>> IF KEITH IS SAFE, SOMEONE WHO

871
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,111
SACRIFICED IMMUNITY FOR SHELTER

872
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:44,616
AND TEA AND COFFEE, WILL ENJOY

873
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,909
NONE OF THOSE THINGS AND WILL BE

874
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:49,162
HEADED TO THE JURY.

875
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:49,579
WHO'S NEXT.

876
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,372
>> ONE OF GIRLS.

877
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:51,956
>> HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

878
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,958
IF WE TAKE OUT CIERA NOW--

879
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,336
>> YOU WANT TO DO CIERA TODAY.

880
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,756
>> YEAH.

881
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,299
CIERA IS NEXT TO GO BECAUSE

882
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:01,841
SHE'S TOO DANGEROUS.

883
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,636
HER SWEETNESS, YOU NEVER THINK

884
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,554
WITH HER THAT SHE'S SO DEVIOUS,

885
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,096
BUT CIERA IS SOMEONE WHO IS

886
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,724
WILLING TO MAKE BIG MOVES,

887
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:10,934
ADVANCE HER CAUSE IN THE GAME.

888
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,143
I THINK GETTING RID OF HER, I

889
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,896
THINK I WOULD WORK WITH

890
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,146
WENTWORTH.

891
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,065
I EVEN THINK ABI I WOULD WORK

892
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:17,273
WITH.

893
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,234
I ALSO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.

894
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,068
I WILL NEED THAT LATER IN THE

895
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,819
GAME AND I DON'T WANT TO WASTE

896
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,198
IT TOO EARLY.

897
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,117
>> SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

898
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,746
>> THE GUY WHO IS LIMPING AROUND

899
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,081
WITH AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS POCKET.

900
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,499
>> PROMISE?

901
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,876
>> PROMISE.

902
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,671
IT'S STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,

903
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,088
STEPHEN, STEPHEN.

904
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,047
>> POOPY PANTS?

905
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,256
>> WHAT.

906
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:41,923
>> POOPY PANTS.

907
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,424
>> STEPHEN.

908
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,551
>> I KNOW.

909
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:44,842
POOPY PANTS.

910
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,219
>> AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,

911
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,096
I'M JUST HOPING THAT THE PLANS I

912
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,140
SET IN MOTION TO BLINDSIDE

913
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,559
STEVEN AND GET RID OF THAT

914
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:52,976
ADVANTAGE PLAY OUT.

915
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,727
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE

916
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,186
SILLY NOT TO TAKE THE

917
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,021
OPPORTUNITY TO FLUSH STEPHEN OUT

918
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,108
OF THE GAME AND FLUSH THAT

919
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:00,358
ADVANTAGE.

920
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:04,153
BUT IN CASE HE PLAYS AN

921
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,614
ADVANTAGE ME AND WENTWORTH ARE

922
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,576
GOING TO WRITE DOWN KIMMI, AND

923
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,578
EVERYBODY ELSE WRITE DOWN

924
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:11,828
FISHBACH.

925
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,453
>> HEY, I WANTED TO SEE WHERE

926
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,454
YOU WERE.

927
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,123
LIKE, IF WE GO WITH THE GIRLS,

928
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:15,957
LIKE, IT'S THE CIERA SHOW, AND

929
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,001
EVERY MOVE THAT SHE'S HERE

930
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,421
THAT'S MADE IS ON HER RESUME.

931
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,548
LIKE, ALL SHE DID WAS THROW OUT

932
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,132
SPENCER-- THROW OUT STEPHEN'S

933
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,217
NAME YESTERDAY, DISPFS LIKE,

934
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:26,843
BOOM, DONE.

935
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:27,885
LIKE THE GODFATHER.

936
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,971
THIS ONE'S NEXT.

937
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,015
THE THING THAT CIERA HAS DONE SO

938
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,810
SUCCESSFULLY IS SHE'S BASICALLY

939
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:36,436
UNHINGED SEVERAL GROUPS.

940
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,522
AND MY QUESTION IS WHY ISN'T

941
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,274
ANYONE TAKING CIERA OUT TO FREE

942
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,026
UP HER PEOPLE WHICH WOULD BE

943
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,027
WENTWORTH AND ABI?

944
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,029
IF WE UNHINGE CIERA'S CREW,

945
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,573
THEY'RE UP FOR GRABS.

946
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:52,535
>> YEAH, TOTALLY.

947
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,578
CIERA STILL SITS THERE AS AN

948
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,496
EASY VOTE, BUT FOR ME, I FEEL

949
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,290
LIKE IT'S IN MY BEST INTEREST TO

950
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,000
GET STEPHEN GONE AS QUICKLY AS

951
00:31:59,083 --> 00:31:59,250
POSSIBLE.

952
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,002
NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

953
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:01,878
CONVINCING ENOUGH PEOPLE TO MAKE

954
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,006
THE RIGHT MOVE.

955
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,174
I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING THE

956
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,843
GIRLS SAY, BUT THEY WANT ME,

957
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:11,179
TASH, HIM, AND KEITH TO VOTE

958
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:11,387
STEPHEN.

959
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,891
>> OH, WE'RE DOING STEPHEN?

960
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,184
>> THAT'S WHAT THE GIRLS JUST

961
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,102
MADE US COMMIT TO STEPHEN.

962
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:18,603
>> YES.

963
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,228
>> OUR FIRST THING WAS SUPPOSED

964
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,314
TO BE CIERA.

965
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,566
>> WHATEVER WE DECIDE WE HAVE TO

966
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,359
DO, WE'RE TOGETHER NOW.

967
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:24,901
THIS IS IT.

968
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,485
>> OH, YEAH.

969
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,152
>> THERE'S NO OTHER--

970
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,529
>> ARE WE SURE THAT'S WHAT THE

971
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,072
GIRLS ARE DOING.

972
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,323
>> RIGHT.

973
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,491
>> THEY'VE REITERATED THAT

974
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:31,824
SEVERAL TIMES.

975
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,161
>> IT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

976
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,121
>> I FEEL LIKE CIERA IS THE

977
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:37,664
BIGGEST THREAT RIGHT NOW.

978
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,499
>> NO, SHE IS.

979
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,376
>> THE ADVANTAGE DOES SCARE ME,

980
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,043
THOUGH.

981
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,419
MY HEAD IS IN TWO PLACES.

982
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,962
I REALLY WANT CIERA GONE

983
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,422
TONIGHT, AND I REALLY WANT

984
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,090
STEPHEN GONE TONIGHT.

985
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,676
I THINK CIERA, I KNOW SHE'S A

986
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:49,884
LIAR.

987
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,178
I KNOW SHE'S PLAYING EVERYBODY,

988
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,638
WHILE I THINK STEVE SEN JUST A

989
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,347
BIGGER THREAT IN THE FACT THAT

990
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,557
HE HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME

991
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,725
WHICH NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS.

992
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,519
>> WHY DON'T WE ALL VOTE FOR

993
00:32:59,602 --> 00:32:59,727
STEPHEN?

994
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,228
>> WE ALL VOTE STEPHEN.

995
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,063
>> HE'S NOT PULLING ANYTHING

996
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:02,230
OUT.

997
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,774
AS LONG AS IT'S A BLINDSIDE, WE

998
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,608
ALL VOTE STEPHEN.

999
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,528
>> IT'S A BAD MOVE.

1000
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,445
SOME PEOPLE SAYING MAYBE THEY

1001
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,947
WANT TO VOTE STEPHEN OUT BECAUSE

1002
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,531
OF HIS ADVANTAGE.

1003
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,032
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S A GREAT

1004
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,117
IDEA RIGHT NOW.

1005
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,160
I HAVE TWO IDOLS.

1006
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,870
BUT I NEED STEPHEN.

1007
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,497
STEPHEN AT LEAST HAS MY BACK.

1008
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,165
I WANT STEVE TONE STAY.

1009
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,375
STEPHEN TRUSTS ME.

1010
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,835
CIERA HAS NO LOYALTY TO ANYBODY.

1011
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,712
SHE'S A FREE AGENT.

1012
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,713
SHE'LL FLOAT ANYWHERE JUST TO

1013
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:27,004
KEEP GOING.

1014
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:27,672
>> OKAY.

1015
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,673
>> STEPHEN WILL STAY WITH US.

1016
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:29,298
>> IF STEPHEN HAS THE ABILITY TO

1017
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,258
MAKE A MOVE, HE WILL.

1018
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,176
AND THAT ADVANTAGE MIGHT GIVE

1019
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,638
HIM THE ABILITY TO MAKE A MOVE.

1020
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,433
SO JEREMY IS ADAMANT.

1021
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,225
IT'S GOT TO BE CIERA.

1022
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,978
IT'S A MISTAKE TO GET RID OF

1023
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:42,228
STEPHEN.

1024
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,062
I WILL NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH

1025
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,522
STEVE NEN THIS GAME.

1026
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,606
STEPHEN WHO HAS AN ADVANTAGE.

1027
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,442
STEPHEN WHO IS CLOSER WITH KIMMI

1028
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,693
THAN ANY TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE

1029
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,653
GAME, WHO COULD EASILY FLIP ON

1030
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,906
US, MOREACY EASLEY THAN CIERA.

1031
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,867
>> YOU'RE GIVING HER SO MUCH

1032
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,117
TRACTION.

1033
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,659
WE'VE GOT TO WRAP THIS UP,

1034
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:02,165
THOUGH.

1035
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,625
>> THIS IS A REALLY CLOSE

1036
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,085
DECISION, MAYBE THE MOST

1037
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:06,711
IMPORTANT DECISION OF THE GAME.

1038
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,047
BUT WHEN BOTH OF US ARE 100%

1039
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,341
CONVINCED THAT THE OTHER IS

1040
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,301
WRONG, ME THAT STEPHEN MUST GO,

1041
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,512
AND JEREMY THAT CIERA MUST GO,

1042
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,680
SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE.

1043
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,307
SOMETHING HAS TO BREAK.

1044
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,141
I HOPE STEPHEN'S GOING HOME.

1045
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,394
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING

1046
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,857
TO HAPPEN AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1047
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,251
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1048
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,338
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1049
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,258
KASS, SAVAGE, AND WIGLESWORTH,

1050
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,385
VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL

1051
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,222
COUNCIL.

1052
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,350
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER.

1053
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,352
IT HAS BEEN ALMOST NONSTOP RAIN

1054
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,563
FOR THE PAST SELF DAYS.

1055
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,397
WENTWORTH, AT THE REWARD

1056
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,273
CHALLENGE, YOU WERE CROUCHED IN

1057
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,275
THE WATER ALMOST LIKE YOU WERE

1058
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,277
READY TO JUST GO AHEAD AND SINK

1059
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:13,820
UNDER AND DROWN YOURSELF.

1060
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,530
>> IT WAS WARMER TO BE SITTING

1061
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,406
IN THE WATER THAN TO BE STANDING

1062
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,951
UP WITH THE RAIN COMING DOWN ON

1063
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:20,326
MY COLD BODY.

1064
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,245
THAT WAS HONESTLY THE FIRST TIME

1065
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,664
I'VE, LIKE, CRIED IN THIS GAME.

1066
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,206
>> Jeff: WOW.

1067
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,624
>> THIS IS LITERALLY THE LOWEST

1068
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,751
I'VE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE.

1069
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,378
>> Jeff: FISHBACH, WHAT WAS

1070
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,128
YOUR LOWEST POINT?

1071
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,256
>> MY LOWEST POINT WAS HAVING

1072
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,091
SEVERE GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS

1073
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,592
AT THE VERY PEAK OF THE STORM.

1074
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,594
I FELT JUST COMPLETELY

1075
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,846
OVERWHELMED, YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS

1076
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,847
FEELING THEY COULDN'T DO IT

1077
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,306
ANYMORE BUT I KNEW I HAD TO.

1078
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,934
>> Jeff: SO THAT BRINGS US TO

1079
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:45,143
TODAY.

1080
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,936
I OFFERED YOU A SHOT TO CHANGE

1081
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,186
THINGS.

1082
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,523
BUT IN EXCHANGE, FIVE OF YOU,

1083
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,942
HALF THE GROUP VTO RISK GIVING

1084
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,360
UP IMMUNITY, KNOWING TRIBAL WAS

1085
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,403
HOURS AWAY.

1086
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,738
CIERA, WHAT WAS YOUR VERY FIRST

1087
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:57,947
THOUGHT?

1088
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,573
>> THE VERY FIRST THOUGHT THAT

1089
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,616
WENT THROUGH MY HEAD IS I'M

1090
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,202
WILLING TO GIVE UP MY SPOT FOR

1091
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,246
THE TEAM BUT WHO ELSE IS?

1092
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,415
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER

1093
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:07,999
TO SURVIVE.

1094
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,250
AND I WANTED TO SHOW THAT I WAS

1095
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,502
GIVING A LITTLE AS FAR AS MAKE

1096
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,295
US STRONGER.

1097
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,714
>> Jeff: TASHA, BEFORE YOU

1098
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,632
MADE YOUR DECISION, WHAT DID YOU

1099
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:16,841
THINK?

1100
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,467
>> MY FIRST QUESTION WAS WHO'S

1101
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,844
GOING TO BE SELFISH AND WHO'S

1102
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,345
GOING TO BE UNSELFISH?

1103
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,556
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

1104
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,892
LIVE WITH MYSELF HAD I NOT CHOSE

1105
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,894
THE UNSELFISH CHOICE.

1106
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,646
>> I CAN INTERJECT REAL QUICK?

1107
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:30,980
>> Jeff: YEAH.

1108
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,190
>> FIPUT OUT THAT WHITE ROCK, I

1109
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:33,566
GO HOME TONIGHT.

1110
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,402
NO QUESTION ASKED.

1111
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,654
>> Jeff: KEITH, WHEN YOU CHOSE

1112
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,697
THE BLACK ROCK, YOU KNEW THERE

1113
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,949
WAS A CHANCE YOU MIGHT BE IN THE

1114
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,199
MINORITY.

1115
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,035
>> YEAH, JEFF, BUT I'M A

1116
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:44,327
COMPETITOR.

1117
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,412
I MEAN, I WAS JUST TRYING TO,

1118
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:50,708
YOU KNOW, KILL THE GOLDEN BOY.

1119
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,042
( LAUGHTER ).

1120
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,084
>> Jeff: SPENCER, SHOULD KEITH

1121
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,961
BE WORRIED TONIGHT?

1122
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,921
>> I DON'T THINK KEITH'S

1123
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,756
DECISION IS GOING TO SWAY

1124
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,674
WHETHER OR NOT HE'S OKAY

1125
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:58,925
TONIGHT.

1126
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,177
I DO KNOW THAT IF KEITH DOESN'T

1127
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,845
GO HOME, SOMEONE IS GOING TO

1128
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,846
SECOND GUESS WHAT THEY DID

1129
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,931
BEFORE THE CHALLENGE FOR A LONG

1130
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,474
TIME.

1131
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,391
>> Jeff: SO FISHBACH, IF KEITH

1132
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,770
IS SAFE, THAT MEANS ONE OF THE

1133
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,313
EIGHT WHO VOLUNTEERED TO GIVE UP

1134
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,399
THEIR SHOT WILL BE BLINDSIDED

1135
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:15,650
TONIGHT.

1136
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,902
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THERE

1137
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:18,611
ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT CLUSTERS

1138
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,572
OF POWER HERE, AND I TRULY HAVE

1139
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,115
NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

1140
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,117
AT THE VOTE TONIGHT.

1141
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,244
>> Jeff: JEREMY, IT STILL

1142
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,955
FEELS AS THOSE THESE VOTING

1143
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,081
BLOCKS ARE STILL MOVING AND THE

1144
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:30,748
QUESTION IS WHERE ARE THEY GOING

1145
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,793
TO BE WHEN WE SAY, "IT'S TIME TO

1146
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,001
VOTE."

1147
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:34,794
>> IT'S JUST CRAZY.

1148
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,836
LIKE, TODAY, THERE WAS A GROUP

1149
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,380
THAT HAD A PLAN, AND YOU SEE ONE

1150
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,840
OR TWO PEOPLE WALK OFF THIS WAY,

1151
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,884
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE WALK OFF THAT

1152
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,051
WAY.

1153
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,302
AND YOU'RE LIKE WAIT A SECOND.

1154
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,637
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

1155
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,722
>> Jeff: TASHA, HAS THERE BEEN

1156
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,307
ANY TALK ABOUT FISHBACH'S

1157
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:48,724
ADVANTAGE?

1158
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,017
>> THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK,

1159
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,060
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE THAT ARE

1160
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,728
WORKING CLOSELY WITH STEPHEN

1161
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,522
FROM A STRATEGIC STANDPOINT.

1162
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,691
>> Jeff: AND, FISHBACH, IF

1163
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,441
ANYONE HERE HAS AN IDOL, NOBODY

1164
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,277
MAY KNOW.

1165
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,236
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU HAVE AN

1166
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,154
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE YOU DID IT IN

1167
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:02,571
FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

1168
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,490
>> YEAH AND KNOW WHAT, WHEN I

1169
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,324
JUMPED OFF THAT PLATFORM, THAT

1170
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,827
THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND.

1171
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,369
"I'M PUTTING A BIG TARGET ON

1172
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,412
MYSELF RIGHT NOW."

1173
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,372
>> Jeff: JEREMY, IT'S

1174
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:11,706
COMPLICATED.

1175
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,376
EAH, YOU WANT THA ADVANTAGE, BUT

1176
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,669
NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU HAVE THE

1177
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,545
ADVANTAGE AND IT'S A BAD

1178
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,087
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

1179
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,256
TARGET ON YOUR BACK NOW, IT'S

1180
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:20,548
TERRIBLE.

1181
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,383
>> IT'S A DISADVANTAGE.

1182
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,592
( LAUGHTER )

1183
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,593
>> Jeff: FISHBACH, LET'S TALK

1184
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,053
ABOUT THE VOTE.

1185
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,138
BECAUSE ALLIANCES ARE SHIFTING

1186
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,265
SO MUCH, YOU CAN'T COUNT ON

1187
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,433
THREE OR FOUR OTHER PEOPLE

1188
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,434
VOTING WITH YOU.

1189
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,476
SO WHAT DO YOU BASE IT ON?

1190
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,854
>> THINGS ARE CHANGING SO

1191
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,230
QUICKLY, YOU BASE YOUR VOTE ON

1192
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:38,107
WHO YOU THINK IS GOING TO.

1193
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,108
YOU FOR TWO DAYS.

1194
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,360
>> Jeff: SO THEN, CIERA, THE

1195
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,029
ONLY CERTAINTY YOU HAVE IS THE

1196
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:43,863
VOTE YOU MAKE.

1197
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,740
>> YEAH, IT REALLY COMPLICATES

1198
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,825
THINGS BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T

1199
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,284
ESTABLISHED LINES YET.

1200
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,577
>> Jeff: BUT IS IT KIND OF

1201
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,703
EXCITING THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE

1202
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,247
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER

1203
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:53,539
BLINDSIDE?

1204
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,373
>> IT IS EXCITING TO SEE HOW THE

1205
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,917
VOTES ARE GOG PLAY OUT, HOW THE

1206
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,336
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VOTE AND IF

1207
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,254
THE PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY WERE

1208
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:04,133
GOING TO VOTE ONE WAY VOTE ONE

1209
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:04,300
WAY.

1210
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,844
IT COULD BE ME THAT WAS

1211
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,554
LINDSIDESIDED AND THAT WILL SUCK

1212
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,557
BECAUSE THAT MEANS I SHOWED A

1213
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,725
WRONG COLOR ROCK AND IT WOULD BE

1214
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,517
A MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE.

1215
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,853
>> Jeff: TASHA IS THAT HOW WE

1216
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,980
HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS, A

1217
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:18,481
MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE?

1218
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,900
>> YEAH AIR, MILLION-DOLLAR

1219
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:21,108
SHELTER.

1220
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:21,734
>> Jeff: LET'S FIND OUT WHO IT

1221
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,653
IS GOING TO BE, IT IS TIME TO

1222
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,488
VOTE.

1223
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:35,414

IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1227
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,450
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1228
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,535
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,020
TIME TO DO SO.

1233

>> YEAH, JEFF.

1234
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,655
MY DECISION COMES DOWN TO WHO

1235
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,784
CAN I TRUST MORE GOING FORWARD?

1236
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:58,497
THAT'S FOR FISHBURN.

ANY VOTE CAST FOR FISHBACH WILL

FITTING IN A VERY UNPREDICTABLE

1278
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,278
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR" THAT

1279
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:52,903
ANOTHER TRIBAL COUNCIL WOULD END

1280
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,072
WITH A BIG MOVE.

1281

I GOT PEOPLE TO PLAY A LITTLE

1289

AND I CAN GENUINELY SAY I WENT

1290
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:08,627

00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,512
THEM DUDES DON'T TRUST YOU.

1302
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,806
>> I KNEW IN TRIBAL COUNCIL I

1303
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,391
WAS GONE.

1304
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,184
>> I KNEW YOU DID.

1305
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:05,851

00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,144

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1312
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,152
I KNOW THAT STEPHEN WILL HAVE MY

1313
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,153
BACK, AND I THINK STEPHEN WANTS

1314
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,154
TO TAKE ME ALL THE WAY TO THE

1315
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,240

1316
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,241
>> THAT WAS AWESOME.

1317
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,242

>> WHEN YOU MAKE MOVES LIKE

KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUGE

1321
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,246
TARGET ON ME NOW AFTER DOING IT,

1322
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,873
BUT THIS GAME IS SO CRAZY, I

1323
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:28,874
FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY'S STILL IN

1324
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:29,875
IT, SO I HAVE WIGGLE ROOM TO

1325
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,462
MAKE THE NEXT MOVE.

1326
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:37,007
LISTEN, SPENCER, I DON'T WANT BE

1327
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,008

00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:42,805
TIME GET BACK FROM TRIBAL.

1329
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,806

00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,398
PRETTY SURE I'M BEING LIED TO.

1333
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,399
SO MAYBE IT MAKES SENSE TO JUMP

1334
00:44:53,482 --> 00:45:13,877
WITH WHOEVER ELSE IS WILLING TO

1335
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:14,461
>> I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, I AM

1336
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,965
ANNOYED AT MYSELF TO HAVE BEEN

1337
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,258
SO-- ABSOLUTELY DIDN'T SEE THAT

1338
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:19,466
COMING.

1339
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:24,263
ZERO, ZERO.

1340
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:28,851
I WAS TOSSING AND TURNING.

1341
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,145
>> I DON'T KNOW, EITHER.

1342
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,897
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK OF MYSELF

1343
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,315
AS HAVING GOOD RESIDENT OFF

1344
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:35,858
PEOPLE, I THINK OF MYSELF AS

1345
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,193
KNOWING THE GAME REALLY WELL, I

1346
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,736
CALL MYSELF A KNOW IT ALL.

1347
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,239
AND LAST NIGHT I KNEW NOTHING.

1348
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,740
FOR EVERY VOTE THIS SEASON I

1349
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,366
BASICALLY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING

1350
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,617
ON, AND YESTERDAY I DIDN'T KNOW

1351
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,493
AT ALL.

1352
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,497
( THUNDER )

1353
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,916
>> IS IT GETTING WORSE, STEPHEN?

1354
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,794
>> YOU NEED TO DRY THOSE OUT FOR

1355
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:56,003
REAL.

1356
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,129
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU

1357
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,797
SAY, "DRY THEM OUT?"

1358
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,716
>> WHEN EVERYTHING IS WET, IT

1359
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,259
DOESN'T HEAL AS FAST SO ALL

1360
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,303
THOSE CUTS AND BITES WILL STAY

1361
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,721
OPEN, EACH GETTING MORE

1362
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,013
INFECTED.

1363
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:06,472
>> YEAH, THAT'S GROSS.

1364
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,557
>> ON TOP OF THIS FEELING OF

1365
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,017
DEFEAT I HAVE, EVERYTHING ELSE

1366
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,226
IS FALLING APART, TOO.

1367
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,896
MY FEET HAVE SWOLLEN UP TO

1368
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:14,730
MONSTER SIZE.

1369
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,648
IT'S VERY PAINFUL FOR ME TO

1370
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:16,857
WALK.

1371
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,484
I HAVE EATEN OR SLEPT IN DAYS.

1372
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,903
I DO FEEL LIKE I'M AT A LOW,

1373
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:21,945
JUST FEELING COMPLETELY

1374
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:26,867
OVERWHELMED BY EVERYTHING.

00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,445
MOST REVERED LEADERS IN

1420
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,032
CAMBODIAN HISTORY, KING JAVARDIN

1421
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,742
VII.

1422
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,911
HE REIGNED DURING THE 12th

1423
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:53,912
AND 13th CENTURY, CONSIDERED

1424
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,374
ONE OF CAMBODIA'S GREATEST TIMES

1425
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,166
IN HISTORY.

1426
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,128
HIS ARMY INCLUDED HORSES,

1427
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,421
ARCHERS, AND FEMALE WARRIORS.

1428
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,046
HE WOULD OVERWHELM HIS OPPONENTS

1429
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,133
WITH THOUSANDS OF CHARGING

1430
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:06,383
ELEPHANTS.

1431
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,926
AT THE START OF HIS REIGN,

1432
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,804
HINDUISM WAS A STATE RELIGION,

1433
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:15,058
AND THE FAMOUS ANCHOR, WAS THE

1434
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,476
LARGEST RELIGIOUS COMPLEX AND

1435
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,186
LARGEST CITY IN THE WORLD.

1436
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,647
IT WAS A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING

1437
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,024
REQUIRING 500,000 STONE BLOCKS

1438
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,108
TOB FLOATED DOWN A RIVER FROM A

1439
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,027
QUARRY 25 MILES AWAY.

1440
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,238
IT TOOK 30 YEARS TO COMPLETE.

1441
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,990
AND IT WAS GEOGRAPHICALLY EQUAL

1442
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,074
IN SIZE TO MODERN-DAY LOS

1443
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,451
ANGELES.

1444
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:36,121
BUT, JEVADIMIN WAS BUDDHIST, NOT

1445
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:36,330
HINDU.

1446
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,956
SO HE BROKE 400 YEARS OF

1447
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,375
TRADITION WHEN HE MADE BUDDHISM

1448
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,668
THE NEW STATE RELIGION.

1449
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,003
THEN HE SET OUT TO BUILD HIS OWN

1450
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,381
TEMPLE, THE BAYON TEMPLE AIR,

1451
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,009
TRIBUTE TO BUDDHISM.

TEMPLES.

1456
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,017
AND TODAY, THOSE TWO TEMPLES,

1457
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,313

00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,328
TRUE ABOUT BAYON TEMPLE?

1483
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:09,464
IT WAS BUILT WITH A STONE FROM

1484
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,215
25 MILES AWAY.

1485
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,591
>> Jeff: SPENCER IS BACK

1486
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:11,758
FIRST.

1487
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,926
THE QUESTION IS, IS HE RIGHT?

1488
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,094
YOU WON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU GET

1489
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,721
HERE AND UNWRAP IT.

1490
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,264
IF IT'S GOLD, PUT IT ON YOUR

1491
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:17,472
STAND.

1492
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,557
IF IT'S WOOD, THROW IT IN THE

1493
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,766
FIRE AND HEAD BACK.

1494
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,978
GOLD MEANS YOU'RE RIGHT.

1495
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,396
WOOD MEANS YOU'RE WRONG.

1496
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,232
KEITH IS WRONG, HE'S GOT TO HEAD

1497
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,066
BACK.

1498
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,151
SPENCER'S RIGHT.

1499
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:32,529
WENTWORTH HAS HER FIRST ONE

1500
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:32,988
RIGHT.

1501
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:33,405
FISHBACH IS RIGHT.

1502
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,365
JEREMY'S RIGHT.

1503
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,658
ABI HAS IT RIGHT.

1504
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:40,036
SHE'S IN IT.

1505
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,382
>> Jeff: KEITH BACK.

1506
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,343
HE WAS WRONG THE FIRST TIME.

1507
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,929
DID HE GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME?

1508
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,389
IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE THERE

1509
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,599
ARE THREE ANSWERS WHICH MEANS

1510
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,600
IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC YOU'LL GET

1511
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,350
IT RIGHT.

1512
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,101
EVERYBODY NOW COMING BACK WITH

1513
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,978
THEIR SECOND.

1514
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:05,312
>> GOOD GRIEF!

1515
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,564
>> Jeff: KEITH MISSED AGAIN.

1516
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:07,856
JOE'S WRONG.

1517
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,816
HE'S GOT TO HEAD OUT.

1518
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,734
THAT'S GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR

1519
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:11,777
FOR SOMEBODY TO TAKE THE LEAD

1520
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,152
WITH TWO.

1521
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,030
IT IS FISHBACH WITH TWO UPON.

1522
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:15,447
HE'S HEADING OUT.

1523
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,156
WENTWORTH IS WRONG.

1524
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,783
SPENCER'S RIGHT.

1525
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:21,203
HE'S GOT TWO.

1526
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,217
>> Jeff: IT IS SPENCER,

1527
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,135
JEREMY, FISHBACH WITH TWO.

1528
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:41,348
WENTWORTH, JOE, AND TASHA WITH

1529
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:41,515
ONE.

1530
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,809
ABI HAS HER SECOND.

1531
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,978
SHE WAS RIGHT.

1532
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,147
ABI'S JUST SLOW.

1533
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,817
MORE PEOPLE COMING BACK.

1534
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,485
JOE WRONG AGAIN.

1535
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,194
FALLING OUT OF THIS QUICKLY.

1536
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,363
>> OH, MY GOSH!

1537
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,157
ATTACHED TO THE LITTLE DISK IS A

1538
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,325
LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER AND IT

1539
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,536
SAYS, "IDOL CLUE."

1540
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,370
>> Jeff: WENTWORTH, SHE HAS

1541
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:03,912
HER SECOND.

1542
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,206
I TOOK THE IDOL CLUE OFF,

1543
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,458
STUFFED IT IN MY PANTS AND KEPT

1544
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:08,667
GOING.

1545
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,209
ANYONE COULD HAVE COME AND

1546
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,502
PICKED THAT ONE ANSWER, AND THEY

1547
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,628
COULD HAVE HAD THE CLUE.

1548
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,339
HOW LUCKY AM I?

1549
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,257
>> Jeff: SPENCER'S RIGHT.

1550
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,551
HE HAS HIS THIRD.

1551
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,094
IT'S SPENCER IN THE LEAD.

1552
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:19,970
FISHBACH IS WRONG.

1553
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:23,348
IT IS NOW SPENCER SLOWLY IN THE

1554
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,307
LEAD WITH THREE.

1555
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,517
WENTWORTH HAS TWO.

1556
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,768
APARRI HAS TWO.

1557
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,395
JEREMY HAS TWO.

1558
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,020
FISHBACH HAS TWO.

1559
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,398
AND TASHA HAS TWO.

1560
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,400
>> 12th AND 13th

1561
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:33,608
CENTURY.

1562
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:37,195
THAT'S THE 1100s AND 1200s.

1563
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,030
>> Jeff: FISHBACH COMING BACK.

1564
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:39,698
JOE COMING BACK.

1565
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:40,907
HE'S BEEN TERRIBLE IN THIS

1566
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:41,283
CHALLENGE SO FAR.

1567
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,661
>> THANKS, JEFF.

1568
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,538
>> Jeff: ABI HAS HER THIRD.

1569
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,623
SHE HASN'T MISSED YET.

1570
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,083
FISHBACH IS RIGHT WITH THREE.

1571
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,001
SPENCER HAS HIS FOURTH.

1572
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:56,756
LOOKING FOR ONE MORE!

1573
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,392
>> SORRY, ABI.

1574
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,311
>> Jeff: ABI COMING BACK WITH

1575
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,312
HER FOURTH.

1576
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,982
JEREMY STILL WORKING IT.

1577
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,817
JEREMY HAS HIS THIRD!

1578
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:16,818
FISHBACH COMING BACK LOOKING FOR

1579
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,737
HIS FOURTH.

1580
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,321
ABI MISSES FOR THE FIRST TIME.

1581
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,073
THAT'S GOING TO COST HER.

1582
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,533
FISHBACH LOOKING FOR HIS FOURTH.

1583
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,201
SPENCER BACK WITH HIS FIFTH.

1584
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,287
THIS COULD BE IT FOR THE WIN.

1585
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,247
FISHBACH IS RIGHT WITH HIS

1586
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:29,456
FOURTH.

1587
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,334
IF HE'S RIGHT, BIG REWARD FOR

1588
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:32,584
SPENCER.

1589
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,418
TASHA JUST LOOKING OVER.

1590
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:37,422
HE'S LOOKING FOR GOLD.

1591
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,215
SPENCER'S WRONG!

1592
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,008
OPENS UP THE DOOR.

1593
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:45,430
WE'RE STILL GOING.

1594
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,272
>> Jeff: IT IS SPENCER AND

1595
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,232
FISHBACH BOTH WITH FOUR.

1596
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:56,650
SPENCER COMING BACK.

1597
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,027
FIR BACK RIGHT ON HIS TAIL.

1598
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:03,490
IT COULD COME DOWN TO THIS.

1599
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:08,119
THIS IS IT.

1600
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,788
FISHBACH HAS IT.

1601
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:13,458
FISHBACH WINS REWARD BY SECONDS

1602
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,250
OVER SPENCER.

1603
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,586
>> GREAT JOB.

1604
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,629
>> Jeff: DID YOU HAVE IT

1605
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:17,837
RIGHT?

1606
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:23,426
>> YEAH, I DID.

1607
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,386

1613
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,226
>> Jeff: BIG REWARD.

1614
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:31,518
>> IT IS.

1615
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,519
>> Jeff: YOU'LL BE PICKED UP

1616
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,311
AT YOUR BEACH ROCK STAR STYLE IN

1617
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,648
A CHOPPER, TAKEN TO A STARLING

1618
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,941
RESORT WHERE YOU WILL HAVE A

1619
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:38,858
GREAT DAY.

1620
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,277
CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO COME WITH

1621
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:41,444
YOU.

1622
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:45,240
>> I HAVE A LOT OF DAMAGE

1623
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:45,573
CONTROL TO DO.

1624
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,199
LAST NIGHT PROVED MY ALLIANCE

1625
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,201
WASN'T AS STRONG AS I THOUGHT

1626
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,745
THEY WERE, I NEED TO TAKE TASHA.

1627
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,247
>> OH, MY GOD.

1628
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:52,998
>> Jeff: CHOOSE ONE MORE AND

1629
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,040
THAT IS IT.

1630
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,333
>> THERE'S ONE GUY, I'M ONLY IN

1631
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,002
THE GAME BECAUSE OF THIS GUY,

1632
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,545
IT'S JEREMY, 100%.

1633
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,715
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T BE HERE TO

1634
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,299
WIN THIS REWARD IF IT WEREN'T

1635
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:03,550
FOR HIM.

1636
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,551
>> Jeff: AS FOR THE REST OF

1637
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,262
YOU, I GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

1638
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,639
EVERYBODY HAD BACK TO CAMP.

1639
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,434
THANKS FOR PLAYING SURVIVOR

1640
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:12,934
FOLKLORE.

1641
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:16,479
>> STEPHEN, THE "SURVIVOR"

1642
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,356
KNOW-IT-ALL, MAKES A VERY

1643
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:18,815
QUESTIONABLE DECISION.

1644
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,692
HE TAKES TASHA AND JEREMY WITH

1645
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:21,443
HIM ON REWARD.

1646
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,485
I THINK IT'S BECOME REALLY CLEAR

1647
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,487
THEY ARE TIGHTER WITH EACH OTHER

1648
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,905
THAN I WILL BE WITH THEM AND I

1649
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,825
NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

1650
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,676
>> CONGRATULATIONS!

1651
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,386
>> RUNNING ON MY MONSTER FEET

1652
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:48,720
WAS VERY HARD.

1653
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,097
>> YEAH, YOU QUIT MILKING THAT

1654
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,015
FOOT, FISH.

1655
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,309
YOU WERE RUNNING LIKE A DEER OUT

1656
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:54,517
THERE.

1657
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,144
>> THE REWARD CHALLENGE WAS VERY

1658
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:56,311
FUN.

1659
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:56,644
IT WAS CRAZY.

1660
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,397
I DID NOT WIN.

1661
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,232
BUT BINGO.

1662
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,901
I GOT AN IDOL CLUE.

1663
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,445
>> JEREMY, FIRST REWARD!

1664
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,197
THAT'S EXCITING!

1665
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,615
I DON'T CARE THEY LOST REWARD.

1666
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,909
THIS HAVING AN IDOL CLUE IS HUGE

1667
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,452
IN THIS GAME.

1668
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,286
"CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE FOUND

1669
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,454
A CLUE TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1670
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,790
IDOL BUT IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO

1671
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,084
PICK THE RIGHT MOMENT TO MAKE A

1672
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,960
VERY BOLD MOVE ATTACHED TO THE

1673
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,337
UNDERSIDE OF YOUR SHELTER DEAD

1674
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,588
CENTER IS THE SECURITY YOU SEEK.

1675
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,464
THE ONLY THING STOPPING YOU FROM

1676
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,591
GETTING IT IS THE FEAR OF

1677
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:27,383
GETTING CAUGHT."

1678
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,510
>> I WONDER WHAT TIME THEY'RE

1679
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,512
GOING TO COME GET YOU ALL.

1680
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,513
>> I CAN'T SEE.

1681
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,431
I CAN'T SEE UNDER THE SHELTER AT

1682
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:33,640
NIGHT.

1683
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,558
I DIG MY HAND UNDER THERE, BUT I

1684
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,851
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S UNDER THERE.

1685
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,020
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS

1686
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:39,270
EXACTLY.

1687
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:39,854
I THINK TOMORROW IS PROBABLY A

1688
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,272
GOOD OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THREE

1689
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,941
PEOPLE WILL BE ON REWARD IS,

1690
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,359
LIKE, THREE LESS BODIES I HAVE

1691
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:50,156
TO KEEP AN EYE ON AND WORRY

1692
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,661
ABOUT.

1693
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,303
>> THIS GAME HAS BEEN SO

1694
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,096
UNPREDICTABLE AND WE HAVE BEEN

1695
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,098
TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT VOTING

1696
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,432
BLOKDZ, EVERY VOTE IS A

1697
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:16,975
DIFFERENT BLOCK.

1698
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,144
BUT I THINK JEREMY PLAYING HIS

1699
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,603
IDOL FOR ME SHOWED THERE IS

1700
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,313
STILL TRUST IN THIS GAME.

1701
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,233
>> OH, GEEZ.

1702
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:25,859
SO I WANTED TO BRING MY CLOSEST

1703
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:26,609
ALLIES WITH ME.

1704
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,528
AND IT LOOKED LIKE THE PERFECT

1705
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,447
PLACE TO REAFFIRM THOSE

1706
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,283
RELATIONSHIPS AND MAKE THOSE

1707
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,659
BONDS MORE CONCRETE.

1708
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:35,493
TO GREAT EXPERIENCES AND

1709
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,913
RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE CREATED ON

1710
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,039
"SURVIVOR" SO FAR.

1711
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,499
>> CHEERS.

1712
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,667
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

1713
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,461
>> TASH AFS ONE OF MY FIRST

1714
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,713
ALLIES BUT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL SHE

1715
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,130
WROTE MY NAME DOWN.

1716
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,840
BUT I FELT MORE THAN I NEEDED TO

1717
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,176
GO ANYTHING I NEEDED TO REPAIR

1718
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,553
MY ALLIANCE WITH TASHA, BREAK

1719
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,804
BREAD AND COME UP WITH A PLAN

1720
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:55,847
MOVING FORWARD WITH THEM.

1721
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,892
>> STEPHEN, I APPRECIATE YOU,

1722
00:57:58,975 --> 00:57:59,058
MAN.

1723
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,395
>> I WANTED TO.

1724
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:03,646
WE'VE BEEN TIGHT SINCE THE VERY

1725
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,564
BEGINNING OF THIS GAME.

1726
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,232
I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME

1727
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:06,733
SUSPICION AND MISTRUST.

1728
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,985
IN THE SPIRIT OF OPENNESS I WANT

1729
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:09,569
TO TELL YOU WHAT MY ADVANTAGE

1730
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,653
IS.

1731
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,571
I CAN STEAL A VOTE.

1732
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,239
>> OH!

1733
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,657
>> SO FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER

1734
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,075
SOMEONE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CAST

1735
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,118
A VOTE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND I

1736
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:17,619
WILL GET A SECOND VOTE.

1737
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,454
>> THAT'S AWESOME.

1738
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,206
>> THAT IS A THREE-VOTE SWING.

1739
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,624
>> THAT'S A GAME CHANGER.

1740
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,625
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'VE BEEN

1741
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:27,170
PLAYING THE VOTE-TO-VOTE GAME.

1742
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,922
EVERYONE HAS BEEN TRYING TO CUT

1743
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:29,297
EVERYONE'S THROAT.

1744
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,757
WE HAVE TO HAVE TRUST.

1745
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,842
>> I HATE TO THROW A WRINKLE IN

1746
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,386
THIS, BUT JOE, IF HE KEEPS

1747
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:35,595
WINNING.

1748
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,221
THAT DUDE, AS SOON AS HE LOSES

1749
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,388
HE HAS TO GO.

1750
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,556
>> JOE, THAT'S IT, HE'S OVER.

1751
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,807
>> I'M IN 100%.

1752
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,059
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

1753
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:46,272
I'M GLAD WE HAD THIS TALK.

1754
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:55,657
>> SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE

1755
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,742
CHOICE OF BEING TASHA AND

1756
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:57,951
JEREMY?

1757
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:58,660
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

1758
00:58:58,743 --> 00:58:59,702
>> OH, I THINK THAT JEREMY, YOU

1759
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,205
KNOW, PLAYED HIS IDOL FOR

1760
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:02,455
STEPHEN.

1761
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:04,958
SO STEPHEN'S OBVIOUSLY REPAYING

1762
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:05,124
HIM.

1763
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,960
>> YOU'VE GOT TO BE BLIND NOT TO

1764
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,170
SEE THEM THREE, OTHERWISE THEY

1765
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:09,963
WOULD HAVE TOOK ME.

1766
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,130
AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN

1767
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,174
SAYING, "WHAT IN THE WORLD IS HE

1768
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,008
DOING TAKING KEITH?"

1769
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:17,178
>> IN A SEASON WHERE THERE'S NO

1770
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:17,762
ALLIANCES AND THERE'S THESE

1771
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:21,099
VOTING BLOCKS AND THE GAME IS

1772
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,558
CONSTANTLY SHIFTING, STEPHEN

1773
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,977
KIND OF THREW HIMSELF OUT THERE

1774
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,853
AND DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT

1775
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:26,688
BECAUSE HE CHOSE TO TAKE JEREMY

1776
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:29,315
AND THEN HE CHOSE TASH.

1777
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,442
>> SEE YOU GUYS IN A LITTLE BIT.

1778
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,361
>> AND FISHBACH AND KIMMI,

1779
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,779
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER QUITE A

1780
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:34,988
WHILE.

1781
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,324
SO I KNOW NOW THAT THERE'S A

1782
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,034
REALLY STRONG CONNECTION THERE

1783
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,578
THAT I NOW REALLY AM WORRIED

1784
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:42,787
ABOUT.

1785
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,707
>> OKAY.

1786
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,457
NOW'S OUR TIME.

1787
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,458
>> IS SHE GONE?

1788
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,084
>> LET'S TALK.

1789
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,502
>> I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD

1790
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:50,837
IDEA FOR US TO LOCK IN WHAT

1791
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,714
WE'RE DOING AND JUST HAVE IT--

1792
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:56,301
HAVE IT SET, HAVE IT SECURED AND

1793
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,428
HAVE A BACKUP IN CASE THAT

1794
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:58,720
PERSON WINS.

1795
00:59:58,803 --> 00:59:59,679
>> WHAT IS OUR PLAN?

1796
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,723
>> I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO GET

1797
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:02,640
RID OF FISHBACH BECAUSE HE HAS

1798
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,183
AN ADVANTAGE, RIGHT?

1799
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,686
>> THE ONLY FEAR I HAVE IS IF HE

1800
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:07,645
USES THIS ADVANTAGE TOMORROW,

1801
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,354
I'M GONE.

1802
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:08,855
THAT'S IT.

1803
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,106
I'M DONE.

1804
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,649
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME-- WHY DON'T

1805
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,694
YOU LET ME WIN THE CHALLENGE

1806
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:15,403
TOMORROW?

1807
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,446
>> UM, NO.

1808
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,655
I'M GOING TO TRY TO WIN THEM

1809
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:17,822
ALL.

1810
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,991
>> I'M TRYING REALLY HARD TO

1811
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,118
TRUST THE ONES CLOSE TO ME, BUT

1812
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,954
JOE IS VERY SKETCHY, AND

1813
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:25,288
SPENCER, TOO.

1814
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,789
I FEEL THAT THEY THINK THAT THEY

1815
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:27,749
ARE PLAYING EVERYONE, AND I

1816
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:31,502
DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE TRYING TO

1817
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,505
PLAY ME AND THE PLAN THAT WE PUT

1818
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:34,756
TOGETHER.

1819
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:38,301
SO I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO

1820
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,803
GO WITH THE PLAN.

1821
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:41,679
>> SO DO WE WANT TO GO STEVEN

1822
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:42,930
AND TASH.

1823
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,724
>> BUT IF STEPHEN WINS IMMUNITY,

1824
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,683
THE PLAN IS TASHA.

1825
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,142
>> OKAY.

1826
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,643
>> THAT'S IT.

1827
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,438
THERE'S NO NEED TO EVEN-- NO

1828
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,064
NEED TO EVEN QUESTION ANYTHING

1829
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:51,230
ELSE.

1830
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,441
>> PERFECT, DONE.

1831
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,193
SO WE'RE SITTING THERE AND I'M

1832
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,527
LIKE, GREAT, WE'VE GOT A PLAN,

1833
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,195
WE'RE GOOD.

1834
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,906
BUT MY GOAL TODAY IS TO SNATCH

1835
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,784
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL OUT

1836
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,243
FROM UNDERNEATH THE SHELTER IN

1837
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,205
ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, I NEED

1838
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:10,792
EVERYBODY TO BE OUT OF CAMP.

1839
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,502
>> YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BOAT

1840
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:12,668
OUT?

1841
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,087
>> YEAH, LET'S TAKE THE BOAT

1842
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:14,253
OUT.

1843
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,088
>> YEAH, GO.

1844
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:15,755
>> WE READY.

1845
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,549
>> I'LL WAVE AT YOU ALL.

1846
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,884
>> LUCKY FOR ME, THE SUN IS OUT.

1847
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,762
JOE AND SPENCER GO OFF TO GO

1848
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:23,012
FISHING.

1849
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,807
KEITH AND KIMMI ARE GOING TO GO

1850
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,684
GET SOME SNAILS AND SOME CRABS.

1851
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:36,901
SO THAT JUST LEAVES MISS

1852
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:37,485
ABI-MARIA.

1853
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:41,364
HOME GIRL WILL NOT LEAVE THE

1854
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:41,614
SHELTER!

1855
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:42,907
>> YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?

1856
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,201
>> I'M OKAY, THANK YOU.

1857
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,994
ABI IS LIKE AN ANNOYING LITTLE

1858
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,329
SISTER, LIKE A LITTLE PEST.

1859
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,622
ANY OTHER TIME, ANY OTHER TIME

1860
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:50,873
OF THE DAY SHE WILL BE OFF IN

1861
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,626
THE WATER, WALKING DOWN TO THE

1862
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:53,835
ROCKS.

1863
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,628
BUT FOR SOME ODD REASON TODAY,

1864
01:01:55,711 --> 01:01:56,796
SHE IS MAKING COFFEE.

1865
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,507
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE'S

1866
01:01:59,590 --> 01:01:59,715
DOING.

1867
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:00,925
I'M LIKE, MY WHEELS ARE

1868
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:01,175

1869
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,428
HOW I DO GET HER OUT OF HERE

1870
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,805
BEFORE THE OTHERS COME BACK.

1871
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:06,472
>> QUIET DAY.

1872
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:06,722
>> YEAH.

1873
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,767
>> I'M JUST PRETENDING TO BE

1874
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,393
SLEEPING HOPING SHE WILL LEAVE,

1875
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:14,522
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN A RAY OF

1876
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,898
LIGHT, ABI GOES, "I THINK I'M

1877
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,358
GOING TO GO LAY IN THE HAMMOCK."

1878
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,152
I'M LIKE, "YES!

1879
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:25,116
YES!"

1880
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,701
I'M LIKE, OKAY, THIS IS MY

1881
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:32,540

I'M TRYING TO GET THE HIDDEN

1887
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:47,972
IMMUNITY IDOL UNDER THE SHELTER.

1888
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,724
ALL OF A SUDDEN, EVERYONE COMES

1889
01:02:49,807 --> 01:03:07,450
BACK IN.

1890
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,118
>> FISHY, FISHY, FISHY.

1891
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,287
>> I AM FREAKING OUT, "A,"

1892
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:11,954
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE MOST

1893
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:12,872
STRESSFUL THING I'VE DONE IN

1894
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,957
THIS GAME BESIDES GETTING THE

01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:21,506
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

1899
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,006
NUMBER TWO.

1900
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:23,966
>> I'LL LEAVE IT THERE FOR A

1901
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:24,217
MINUTE.

1902
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,135
SO I AM READY TO SHAKE UP THIS

1903
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,471

1921
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,992
USING JUST YOUR 10 LITTLE

1922
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:31,242

1932
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,762
BOTH PARTICIPATED, BOTH LOST.

1933
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:52,430

FIRST STEP IS UNSPOOLG THAT ROPE

1946

WHICH IS NOT NEARLY AS EASY WHEN

1947
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,044

1958
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,979

01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:46,979
GROUP.

2033
01:07:47,062 --> 01:07:49,982
ONLY FIVE PEOPLE HAVE EVER WON

2034
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:52,067
FIVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITIES IN

2035
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:52,359
ONE SEASON.

2036
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,070
>> OH!

2037
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:55,279
WHAT!

2038
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,323

2040
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,200
A LOT OF BLOCKS JUST FELL FROM

2041
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:00,117
JOE, AND HE'S GOT TO GO

2042
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:03,329
BACKWARDS NOW AND PICK IT UP.

01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,623
SPENCER PLACES HIS THIRD ON THE

2044
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:11,128

OH, BUT DISASTER FOR KEITH.

2046
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:13,839
HE'S GOT TO GO BACK.

2047
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,132
YOU ARE NOT OUT OF THIS

2048
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,052
CHALLENGE UNTIL SOMEBODY PLACES

2049
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:19,303
THAT FLAG BECAUSE IT GETS MORE

2050
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:20,429
AND MORE DIFFICULT THE HIGHER

2051
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,597
YOU GO.

IT IS NOW SPENCER IN THE LEAD,

2055
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,231
JOE HAS REPAIRED ALL THE DWJ AND

2056
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,232

2057
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:36,112

SPENCER PLACES HIS FIFTH.

2060
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,115
IT IS NOW SPENCER AND JOE.

01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,077
JOE PLACES HIS FIFTH.

2062
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,161
THE LAST PERSON TO RELEASE HIS

SPENCER HAS SIX.

2067
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:54,964
THIS WOULD BE A HUGE

2068
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,299
COME-FROM-BEHIND FOR SPENCER TO

2069
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,843
DETHRONE JOE.

AND HE'S GOT IT.

2077
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,317
SPENCER NOW HAS ONE STEP LEFT,

2078
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,987

AND BECOME THE FIFTH MEMBER OF

2105
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:14,835
OUR JURY.

2106
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,670
ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN, IT

2107
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,296
WILL NOT BE YOU.

2108
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,547
CONGRATS.

2109

>> TODAY, I DID NOT WIN

2113
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:23,636
IMMUNITY.

2114
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,597
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SAFE FOR 29

2115
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,389
DAYS, AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, I

2116
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,767
DON'T HAVE THAT NECKLACE AND

2117
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:32,603
THAT POWER AND THAT SAFETY, I'M

2118
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:33,812
VULNERABLE TO GOING HOME.

2119
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,272
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, I'M

2120
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,357
REALLY NERVOUS.

2121
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:04,802
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

2122
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:09,139
>> THANKS.

2123
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,475
>> YOU WERE RIGHT THERE, RIGHT?

2124
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:12,393
>> JOE HAS LITERALLY NEVER BEEN

2125
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:14,812
UP FOR ELIMINATION IN THIS GAME,

2126
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:17,106
NOT ONCE IN 29 DAYS.

2127
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:19,525
AND TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME HE

2128
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:19,692
IS.

2129
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,860
>> I WASN'T EVEN TOUCHING IT AND

2130
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,571
IT FELL OFF AND KNOCKED OVER

2131
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:25,030
THREE OUT OF NOWHERE.

2132
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,866
>> I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TAKE

2133
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,326
OUT JOE SINCE DAY ONE.

2134
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:29,702
>> GOOD WIN, MAN.

2135
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:30,786
>> THANKS.

2136
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,664
I DIDN'T THINK THAT WOULD BE MY

2137
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:33,914
CHALLENGE.

2138
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,708
>> AND I HAVE JUST BEEN SPOILED

2139
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,875
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

2140
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,086
AGAIN AS HE HAS WON IMMUNITY

2141
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,422
AFTER IMMUNITY AFTER IMMUNITY.

2142
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:48,220
AND NOW, I FINALLY HAVE MY SHOT.

2143
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:48,846
YOU WILL BE HERE A MONTH, AND

2144
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:52,641
ONE OF US WILL NOT.

2145
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,268
>> ALL RIGHT, WE NEED TO HAVE,

2146
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,561
LIKE, A FRANK CONVERSATION.

2147
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:56,186
>> YEAH.

2148
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:56,437
>> RIGHT.

2149
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,857
>> WHAT ABOUT JOE?

2150
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,775
>> JOE'S A THREAT AS FAR AS I'M

2151
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:02,067
CONCERNED.

2152
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,694
>> HE IS A THREAT.

2153
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:06,322
HE WINS A TON OF IMMUNITIES.

2154
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:06,905
HE COULD GO ON ANOTHER RUN.

2155
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,532
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

2156
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:09,742
>> I THINK JOE IS THE BIGGEST

2157
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,410
CHALLENGE GUY, LIKE, HE COULD

2158
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,328
JUST KEEP WINNING.

2159
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:13,871
WE WANT TO GET HIM WHEN HE

2160
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:14,371
DOESN'T HAVE PROTECTION.

2161
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:15,414
>> RIGHT.

2162
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,166
>> JOE, RIGHT?

2163
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:20,669
>> IF JOE ASKS YOU, YOU'RE

2164
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:21,086
VOTING ABI.

2165
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:21,295
>> OKAY.

2166
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,464
>> AND IF ABI PULLS US ASIDE,

2167
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:26,133
THEN WE'RE JUST SAYING JOE.

2168
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:26,675
>> FINE.

2169
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,345
>> JEREMY, GOOD?

2170
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:30,721
EVERYBODY GOOD.

2171
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:31,847
>> LET'S HAVE PEACE OF MIND FOR

2172
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:32,890
THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON.

2173
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:33,474
>> YES.

2174
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:36,769
>> THE FOUR-- KIMMI, STEPHEN,

2175
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,729
JEREMY, AND TASHA-- ARE GOING TO

2176
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:40,522
TARGET JOE, BUT IT'S NOT GOING

2177
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,482
TO HAPPEN BECAUSE I HAVE FIVE

2178
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:44,276

>> PLEASE TELL ME IT'S NOT ME

2183
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:53,077

>> GET OUT OF THAT MENTALITY.

2195
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,256
>> OKAY.

2196
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,633
TONIGHT IS A REALLY BIG TEST.

2197
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,510
I'M REALLY RELYING ON MY SOCIAL

2198
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:12,096
GAME WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DEVELOP

2199
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,264
IN THIS GAME THAT I DIDN'T

2200
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:14,848
REALLY DEVELOP AND HAVE IN THE

2201
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,809
LAST GAME.

STEPHEN, AND I GUESS TIME WILL

01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:26,652
TELL.

2209
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,404
TRIBAL IS ONLY A COUPLE OF HOURS

2210
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:29,988
AWAY, AND I'M HOPING FOR THE

2211
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,491
BEST.

2212
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:33,659

DO?

2216
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:37,913
>> YEAH, RIGHT?

2217
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:41,792
>> YEAH YUP, THAT SOUNDS

2218
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:42,167
ACTUALLY, AWESOME.

2219
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,962
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

2220
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:45,170
YEAH.

2221
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,714
>> SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T BELIEVE

2222
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:48,132
ME.

2223
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:49,591
>> I'M TALKING TO YOU, AND

2224
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,552
YOU'RE LIKE-- WHAT DO YOU WANT

2225
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:52,886
FROM ME?

2226
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,138
I'M TELLING YOU I WANT TO WORK

2227
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,055
WITH YOU.

2228
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,056
WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

2229
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:56,807
>> THAT'S IT.

2230
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:57,349
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

2231
01:13:57,432 --> 01:13:57,683
>> OKAY.

2232
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:58,225
>> OKAY.

2233
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,978
THE PLAN IS ABI IS VOTING FOR

2234
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:03,105
JOE, AND JOE IS VOTING FOR ABI,

2235
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,607
BUT ABI IS INSANE.

2236
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,943
SHE IS SUSPICIOUS OF ME BECAUSE

2237
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,194
SHE'S SUSPICIOUS OF EVERYONE.

2238
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,821
THIS IS A GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO

2239
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:11,822
TRAWFT PEOPLE WITH YOUR FATE IN

2240
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:14,032
THIS GAME, AND I HAVE TWO

2241
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,285
CONVINCE JOE THAT WE ARE VOTING

2242
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:19,830
FOR ABI.

2243
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:21,665
>> I DON'T LIKE IT, BUT I'M

2244
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:23,709
TRYING TO BELIEVE WHAT'S

2245
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:24,001
BELIEVABLE.

2246
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:27,129
>> SHE WAS SARCASTIC ABOUT IT.

2247
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,714
>> SHE'S NOT IN A GOOD PLACE.

2248
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:29,631
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY I THINK

2249
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,592
SHE THINKS IT'S HER.

2250
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:31,967
>> I TOLD HER--

2251
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,720
>> I DON'T THINK SHE BELIEVES

2252
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:35,470
ANYTHING AT THIS POINT.

2253
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:38,390
>> JOE IS VERY SHADY.

2254
01:14:38,473 --> 01:14:40,392
HE IS HAVING A LITTLE POWWOW

2255
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:42,186
WITH JEREMY AND FISHBACH, SO

2256
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:42,728
I'M, LIKE, WHAT THE HECK IS

2257
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:47,649
GOING ON HERE?

2258
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:48,650
I DO NOT TRUST JOE AT THIS

2259
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:48,859
POINT.

2260
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,903
>> WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE

2261
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:51,069
FOR?

2262
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,487
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

2263
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,031
I'M GOING TO HAVE THO CHOOSE AT

2264
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:54,239
TRIBAL.

2265
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:54,573
>> ALL RIGHT.

2266
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,366
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

2267
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,243
>> OH, GOD, ABI IS FREAKING OUT

2268
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:58,952
RIGHT NOW.

2269
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:00,037
>> I THINK JOE IS PLAYING YOU

2270
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:00,245
AND ME.

2271
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,663
>> NO, I DON'T.

2272
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:02,789
I DON'T.

2273
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,750
I THINK THAT THIS PLAN WE HAVE

2274
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:14,343
TO GO WITH.

2275
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:14,968
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

2276
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,845
>> I HAVE SOME DECISION TO MAKE.

2277
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:17,721
>> FIFEEL ANYTHING WEIRD TONIGHT

2278
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,598
AND PEOPLE DO NOT STICK WITH THE

2279
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,725
FISHBACH PLAN, THE IDOL IS

2280
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:22,768
COMING OUT.

2281
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,770
>> ALL RIGHT, ABI, WHAT'S GOING

2282
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:24,937
ON?

2283
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,730
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING

2284
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:26,897
ON.

2285
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,732
>> THE PLAN THAT WE MADE

2286
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:29,608
YESTERDAY IS GOING ON.

2287
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,276
>> ALL RIGHT.

2288
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,277
>> AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

2289
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:32,736
TO WORRY ABOUT.

2290
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:33,320
>> OKAY.

2291
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:34,696
>> YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE UNHAPPY.

2292
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,031
>> I'M COOL.

2293
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:38,116
I'M READY TO GO HOME IF I HAVE

2294
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:38,533
TO TONIGHT.

2295
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,952
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME,

2296
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:40,160
THOUGH.

2297
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,495
>> BUT I'M READY TO IF THAT'S

2298
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:41,995
WHAT IT IS.

2299
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:42,746
I'M NOT WORRIED.

2300
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:43,538
>> BUT IT'S NOT.

2301
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:44,248
>> OKAY.

2302
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:44,790
WHY ARE YOU FREAKING OUT?

2303
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,792
IS EVERYTHING OKAY WITH YOU?

2304
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:47,334
LET IT BE.

2305
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,127
I MEAN, TO ME, IT DOESN'T MATTER

2306
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,963
WHO GOES HOME.

2307
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:51,672
I WILL DECIDE THAT AT TRIBAL.

2308
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:53,799
>> ABI IS ON THE WAR PATH, AND

2309
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:57,010
I'M SCARED THAT ABI'S GOING TO

2310
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,179
REACT, VOTE FOR JOE, AND THIS

2311
01:15:59,263 --> 01:15:59,805
ENTIRE PLAN IS GOING TO GO DOWN

2312
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,307
THE TIEWKS BECAUSE THERE'S NINE

2313
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,642
PEOPLE LEFT.

2314
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,227
WE HAVE FIVE, AND I NEED

2315
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,145
EVERYONE TO STICK TO THIS PLAN.

2316
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:07,771
ABI, IF TEE DON'T STICK WITH THE

2317
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:10,190
PLAN, IF WE DON'T VOTE FOR

2318
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,525
STEPHEN, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW

2319
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:12,484
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

2320
01:16:12,567 --> 01:16:14,736
>> AM I GOING TO HAVE TO JUST GO

2321
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,572
TOTALLY AGAINST THE PLAN FROM

2322
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:17,823
YESTERDAY?

2323
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,200
I CAN VOTE FOR FISHBACH OR JOJO.

2324
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:21,576
I HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

2325
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:21,827
WE'LL SEE.

2326
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,579
>> THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I KNEW

2327
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:25,163
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH ABI,

2328
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:25,664
AND IT'S HAPPENING.

2329
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,583
>> ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

2330
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,085
>> WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR JOE.

2331
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,169
>> JOE HAS AN IDOL.

2332
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:31,628
>> NO, HE DOESN'T.

2333
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,046
>> YOU'RE SURE?

2334
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,089
>> NO.

2335
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:35,173
>> BUT HE HAS TO.

2336
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:35,716
THAT'S THE PLAN.

2337
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:36,300
I MEAN--

2338
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:37,676
>> HE GETS THE MAJORITY OF THE

2339
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,844
VOTES.

2340
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:39,886
THAT'S WHY IF HE DOESN'T HAVE

2341
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,263
THE IDOL, HE GOES HOME.

2342
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:42,806
>> THERE COULDN'T BE MORE

2343
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,182
PANDEMONIUM RIGHT NOW.

2344
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:44,850
BUT I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE, AND MY

2345
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,686
ADVANTAGE ALLOWS ME TO STEAL A

2346
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,063
VOTE, AND NOW I HAVE THE NUMBERS

2347
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,941
TO SPLIT THE VOTES RELIABLY.

2348
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,944
EITHER WE LOSE JOE OR WE LOSE

2349
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,821
ABI AND JOE'S IDOL,.

2350
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,449
>> I THINK I'M GOING TO PLAY MY

2351
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:00,866
ADVANTAGE TONIGHT.

2352
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,035
WILL YOU VOTE FOR ABI AND NOT

2353
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:03,201
JOE?

2354
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:06,163
>> I'M QOOL THAT, BUT WHAT'S THE

2355
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:06,371
GOAL?

2356
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:06,705
WHAT HAPPENS.

2357
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:07,247
>> WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE

2358
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,832
VOTES, BUT USING MY ADVANTAGE.

2359
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:09,750
>> OKAY.

2360
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,127
BUT, LIKE, I KIND OF WANT TO

2361
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:12,586
KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS.

2362
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:14,504
>> I CAN STEAL A VOTE FROM

2363
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:14,713
SOMEONE.

2364
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:15,005
>> RIGHT.

2365
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:15,714
>> I GOT ENOUGH TRUST GOING WITH

2366
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,050
THEM THAT STEPHEN REVEALED TO ME

2367
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,093
WHAT HIS ADVANTAGE WAS, AND I

2368
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,346
WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT IT WOULD

2369
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:23,555
DESTROY EVERYTHING, EVEN THOUGH

2370
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:24,431
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT TO

2371
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:26,641
PUT WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN INTO

2372
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:30,062
PLACE, IT COULD ALL GO TO CRAP.

2373
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,481
STEPHEN HAS AN ADVANTAGE.

2374
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:34,691
ABI IS THE MOST UNRELIABLE

2375
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,526
PERSON HERE.

2376
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,736
WE ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR

2377
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:37,944
AN IDOL.

2378
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:41,531
AND A REASON TO BLINDSIDE JOE.

2379
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,367
OUR PLAN THAT WE HAMMERED OUT IS

2380
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:43,784
TO TAKE OUT STEPHEN.

2381
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:47,287
BUT IF I GO THAT ROUTE, I RUN A

2382
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:47,788
BIG RISK.

2383
01:17:47,871 --> 01:18:02,469
AND IT SCARES ME TO DEATH.

2384
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,435
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

2385
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:16,233
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

2386
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:19,152
KASS, SAVAGE, WIGLESWORTH, AND

2387
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:19,861
CIERA, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

2388
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:23,782
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2389
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:28,161
SO, JOE, BIG STORY HAS TO BE

2390
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:29,913
THAT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE WE

2391
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:32,499
MERGED, YOU ARE NOT WEARING

2392
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:32,791
IMMUNITY.

2393
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,042
>> OH, YEAH.

2394
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:34,876
ALL AFTERNOON I'VE BEEN MULLING

2395
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,087
THAT OVER IN MY HEAD, AND THE

2396
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:37,838
ONLY THING I CAN REALLY DO IS

2397
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,923
HOPE THE TRUST I BUILT WITH

2398
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:41,299
PEOPLE CAN TAKE ME A LITTLE

2399
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,843
FURTHER IN THE GAME.

2400
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:44,511

01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,181
LIKE JOE SAYING, "THERE'S REALLY

2403
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:49,599
NOTHING FOR ME TO DO OTHER THAN

2404
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:50,642
HOPE WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO

2405
01:18:50,725 --> 01:18:52,269
HAPPEN IS GOING TO HAPPEN?

I'M NOT GOING TO SCRAMBLE."

2407
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,105
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT

2408
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:56,815
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE GAME IF

2409
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:57,065
ANYTHING.

2429
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:31,349
GOING FORWARD.

2430
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,686
I NEED TO START FINDING THAT

BLOCK HAS ELIMINATED THE LITTLE

2439
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:50,869
TRUST YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD FROM

2440
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,412
YOUR ALLIANCE THAT YOU KNEW YOU

2441
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:52,829
WERE GOOD WITH.

2442

>> YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF.

2443
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:56,249
THERE DEFINITELY ARE ALLIANCES

2444
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,043
AT THE REWARD CHALLENGE STEPHEN

2445
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:58,960
CHOSE TASHA BECAUSE HE SAID HE

2446
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,546
NEEDED TO MEND FENCES WITH AN

2447
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,255
ALLIANCE MEMBER.

2448
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:05,467
>> THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OLD

2449
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:05,800
COLLOQUIALISM.

2450
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:06,927
I SHOULD HAVE SAID VOTING BLOCK.

2451
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:07,302
>> IT CAME OUT.

2452
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,347
I'M SAYING, IF YOU USE THE WORD

>> Jeff: FISHBACH AT THE LAST

2456
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:13,475
TRIBAL THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK

2457
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:14,601
ABOUT THE ADVANTAGE.

2458
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:15,852
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S A SCARY

2459
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:17,979
THING ADDING ONE, BIG, GIANT

2460
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:20,398
UNKNOWN THAT COULD UPEND

2461
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:20,690
EVERYTHING.

2462
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:21,691
SO I COULD UNDERSTAND WHY IT

2463
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:22,275
WOULD BE VERY THREATENING AND

2464
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:24,194
PUT A GIANT TARGET ON ME AND I

2465
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:24,986
THINK IT DID.

2466
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,738
>> Jeff: SO ARE YOU GENUINELY

2467
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:28,490
CONCERNED AGAIN, GIVEN LAST

2470
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:29,950
>> ABSOLUTELY.

2471
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:30,992
YOU KNOW, I THINK LAST TRIBAL

2472
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,036
SHOWED THE IDOL MAKES PEOPLE

2473
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:34,788
WANT TO SPLIT VOTES, AND THAT

2474
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:36,248
MAKES IT VERY EASY FOR ANOTHER

2475
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,166
GROUP OR FACTION TO VOTE MY WAY.

2476
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,668
>> Jeff: WOW.

2477
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:41,086
SPENCER, SO COMPLICATED.

2478
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:44,005
>> INSANELY COMPLICATED.

01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,632
I MEAN SPLIT VOTES, IDOLS,

THERE ARE SO MANY PERMUTATIONS

2482
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,553
OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN, AND WE'RE

2483
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:55,517

THERE WERE A LOT OF NAMES BEING

2488

IT WAS JUST, LIKE, ALL OVER THE

2490
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:04,359
PLACE.

2491
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:05,527
I ACTUALLY HAVE A HEADACHE.

2492
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:07,445
I CAN'T EVEN THINK STRAIGHT.

2493
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,905

2500
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,671
AND THERE IS A LOW RISK OF

2501
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:24,963
BLINDSIDE.

2502
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,214
