00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,507
LINDSAY:
That was wild.

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,242
-MIKE: You can breathe.
-Oh, my God.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,612
-I am so happy I'm here
with all of you.
-MARYANNE: Yeah.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,848
I need to give everybody a hug.

5
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:15,515
Oh.

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,683
Nobody wanted to see you go.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,586
Oh, my God, I'm so, so happy.

8
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,554
-Wow. How wild was that?
-MIKE: Hey, Lindsay...

9
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:25,759
That was the best Tribal Council
ever. Ever, ever, ever.

10
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,629
<i>I couldn't believe that</i>
<i>I actually picked the right box.</i>

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,631
That was awesome.

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,500
<i>And then Drea pulls out</i>

13
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,535
her advantage, which says

14
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,537
that she can ask anybody
one question--

15
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,773
if they have an advantage,
or they have an idol.

16
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,841
<i>And they have to be honest</i>
<i>if they do,</i>

17
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,143
<i>and if they do,</i>
<i>they have to give it to her.</i>

18
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,978
Mike, do you have an idol?

19
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,880
No.

20
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,417
I can verify
Mike is telling the truth.

21
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,218
Oh, my gosh!

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,190
Omar, you're the only person
I told the secret to, and I want

23
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,591
-everyone else to know that.
-(Hai gasps)

24
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:02,395
(laughs)

25
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,397
It was a such a great play.

26
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,866
So, she didn't get to use it.

27
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,235
<i>The vote went to Drea.</i>
<i>She's out.</i>

28
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,771
<i>Now my amulet is now</i>
<i>a hidden immunity idol,</i>

29
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,706
<i>which I have to use at six.</i>

30
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,108
<i>So I plan</i>
<i>on using that tomorrow.</i>

31
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,276
So, win, win, win.

32
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,044
Great day for me.

33
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,847
Dude, crazy lows, crazy highs.

34
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,149
-This game's insane.
-MARYANNE: Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,452
-LINDSAY: Drea took it awesome.
-She took it really well.

36
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,787
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>Tonight went</i>

37
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,689
perfectly.

38
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,624
Like, I wanted to unleash
my evil laugh, like...

39
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,860
(laughs)

40
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,229
Because my plan
just worked out so well.

41
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,402
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>My relationship</i>
<i>with Mike right now</i>

42
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,204
is right where I want it,
because he sees me

43
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,638
as his savior in the game.

44
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,040
Like, I saved his life

45
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:50,043
<i>and saved his idol</i>
<i>and gave it back to him.</i>

46
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,917
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>So my goal</i>
<i>in the next day is to pull</i>

47
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,887
Jonathan and Mike apart,

48
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,755
<i>make them distrust each other,</i>
<i>and know</i>

49
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,258
<i>that each other has to go next</i>

50
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,094
so that when the time comes,
I can pick a side.

51
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,096
And, you know,
it'll be a clean swipe--

52
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,965
Mike or Jonathan out.

53
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,404
-No, I didn't see them.
-Oh, Omie.

54
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,243
(Omar laughs softly)

55
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,178
JONATHAN:
Hey.

56
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,914
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>We made a great move,</i>
<i>it worked out, but,</i>

57
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,716
<i>at the end of the day,</i>
<i>people want to get to the end,</i>

58
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,451
<i>and they're gonna look</i>
<i>for their best possible angle.</i>

59
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,052
<i>And I know that Omar's</i>

60
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,889
afraid of me at the final
because I'm too likable.

61
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,891
<i>I wouldn't want to take me</i>
<i>to the end at this point,</i>

62
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,527
<i>so I get it. I would try</i>
<i>and cut me loose, too.</i>

63
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,195
So I have to do
what comes natural.

64
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,364
I have to cut Omar loose.

65
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,787
So...

66
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,457
So, it would be like...

67
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,195
-The merge started, yeah.
-Okay?

68
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,501
Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,237
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Right now, I need to prove</i>
<i>to Maryanne that Omar</i>

70
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,239
<i>is not her pawn,</i>
<i>and he's working against her.</i>

71
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,241
I'm setting the game plan
in motion.

72
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,877
<i>I just got to nourish it,</i>
<i>and in this game,</i>

73
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,712
<i>you got to not go too fast,</i>

74
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,581
<i>not be down their throat,</i>
<i>let them</i>

75
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,849
make their own decision,
but you give 'em a little nudge.

76
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,092
<i>MARYANNE:</i>
<i>Mike is right.</i>

77
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,063
<i>At Tribal Council, what the jury</i>
<i>saw was Omar just go</i>

78
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,898
from a caterpillar
to a butterfly.

79
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,733
This was someone who was sitting
in the background and, like,

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,736
boom, he's the reason
why Drea wa-was gone.

81
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,471
<i>And I'm like, "There is no way</i>
<i>that I can beat him."</i>

82
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,306
<i>So I'm thinking,</i>

83
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,976
being like, "Okay, there always
comes a time in this game

84
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,178
"when you have people
that you trust,

85
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,280
"but the people that you trust,
if you know they can beat you,

86
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,815
you have to do something."

87
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,083
Okay.

88
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,620
Okay.

89
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,054
Oh.

90
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,794

<i>I'm thinking right now</i>

92
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,933
this is honestly a hard decision
'cause I know Omar

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,501
and I love Omar
and I trust Omar,

94
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,637

<i>But if I don't make this move,</i>

Yeah.

99

Mm-hmm.

<i>LINDSAY: My plan now is,</i>

<i>I can't have him here</i>
<i>long enough</i>

105

<i>that he has another chance</i>

106
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,235
His ability to win challenges
is a huge threat.

107
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,570
I don't want him
to keep winning challenges.

108
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,305
<i>He's my main nemesis in that.</i>

109

"But I can't promise you yet."

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,398

chocolate cake and cookies,

170
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,922
Jonathan across the net.

171
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,290
There goes Lindsay.
There goes Maryanne.

172
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,325
Aah!

173
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,195
PROBST:
Lindsay tearing up those knees.

174
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,530
Man!
Now you got to get on the beam.

175
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,434
If you fall off,
you got to start again.

176
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,137
Maryanne's dizzy. Jonathan's
dizzy. He's coming back.

177
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,607
Here comes Romeo. Maryanne is
now trying to unspin

178
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,510
to reverse her dizziness.

179
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,912
Never seen anything like it.

180
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,049
Jonathan untying his key.

181
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,651
(gasps)

182
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,420
Lindsay trying
to stay on the beam

183
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,256
by using the rope to balance.

184
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,259
Mike drops.
He's got to go back.

185
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,762
Jonathan first across.
He's got the key.

186
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,996
Start unlocking those pieces.

187
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,872
Lindsay's good.

188
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,508
And Lindsay is across.
Start working on your puzzle.

189
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,243
Omar working on his key,

190
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,945
-Mike working on his key.
-MARYANNE: Ooh.

191
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,516
Omar has his key,
and you're across. You're good.

192
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,451
You're good, Romeo.

193
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,788
Mike's got a rhythm now.
Just get across. You're good.

194
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,757
You're good. Maryanne can
start working on her puzzle.

195
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,328
You're building a compass rose

196
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,800
piece by piece,
and you're studying as you go,

197
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,703
making sure it's right.

198
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,073
If you're right,
it's just a matter of time

199
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,709
before disappointment smacks you
in the face.

200
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,214
Sometimes it's fun
to just listen

201
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,683
to the sounds of the challenge.

202
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,720
(soft muttering)

203
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:26,859
This is hard.

204
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:35,668
PROBST:
Maryanne continues
to add pieces.

205
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,504
She was dead last to the puzzle,

206
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:43,075
and now she's down to a few
pieces left if she's right.

207
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,478
What am I doing wrong?
There's something wrong.

208
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,548
PROBST:
Now Omar with momentum.

209
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,952
It's now Omar in the lead,

210
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,087
Maryanne trying to catch Omar.

211
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,256
(gasps)
Oh, my gosh.

212
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,961
PROBST:
Omar with another piece.

213
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,864
♪ ♪

214
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,100
No, that's wrong.

215
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,937
-Jeff?
-PROBST: Omar thinks he has it.

216
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,040
-How confident are you?
-100%?

217
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,110
-Omar wins!
-LINDSAY: Nice!

218
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,945
-MIKE: Nice job, Omar.
-Great job!
-PROBST: Nice job!

219
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,480
-Oh, good job.
-MIKE: I had it, too.

220
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,515
I was right... I finally got
to the right track.

221
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,949
LINDSAY:
Nice.

222
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,552
Great job. I'm proud of you.

223
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,388
Good job.

224
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,158
Omar, come on over.

225
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,660
-Whew. (laughs)
-Whew. Good job, Omar.

226
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,795
-OMAR: Thank you.
-Nice job, Omie.

227
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,695
I never thought
I'd be next to you.

228
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,397
-Really?
-No.

229
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,465
-PROBST: You didn't think so?
-You surprise yourself out here.

230
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,133
-Yeah.
-You don't know what you're

231
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,035
capable of
until you have to do it.

232
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,737
-So...
-What surprised you about today?

233
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,338
Which part of this challenge?

234
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,507
I thought I was going
to blow through the puzzle,

235
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,176
but it was actually
really, really hard.

236
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,145
And my niece is afraid
to try anything new.

237
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,847
And I was terrified of
all the challenges, and I hope

238
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,148
she sees this,
and it inspires her

239
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,217
earlier in life
to take those risks.

240
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,185
-'Cause she's only eight.
-What's your...?

241
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,886
-What's your niece's name?
-Hannah.

242
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:04,223
Okay, so, Hannah, you're eight,
and there are millions

243
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,493
of other eight, nine,
ten-year-olds just like you.

244
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,496
Hear that message because
that is what<i> Survivor</i> is about.

245
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,200
-It is about pushing yourself
to your personal limit...
-Yeah.

246
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,202
and then seeing
if you got one more step.

247
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,071
That's what you've been doing
for 22 days. Today,

248
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,073
you did it.
You're in charge.

249
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,608
-You have a couple
of decisions to make.
-Okay.

250
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,444
You're going to decide,
do you want sustenance--

251
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,079
which is
grilled chicken and veggies--

252
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,748
or if you want chocolate cake
and cookies.

253
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,350
-Here's the additional twist.
-Yeah.

254
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,352
The invitation
with grilled chicken and veggies

255
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,287
includes two players.

256
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,856
-Okay.
-The invitation

257
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,959
with chocolate cake and cookies
includes three.

258
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,796
-Oh, man.
-So now you have
a very big dilemma.

259
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,798
OMAR:
You know,
we're all really out here

260
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,234
and really, really deprived,
so I think

261
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,237
I'm going to give
some more people...

262
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,973
And I'm really sorry
for the two I don't choose.

263
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,375
All right,
so you're going to take

264
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,244
chocolate cake and cookies,
and you're going to bring

265
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,312
three people with you,
which means

266
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,915
two will not participate
in this.

267
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,750
There's one person here
who's eaten nothing,

268
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,218
so I can't not pick Romeo.

269
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,720
-MIKE: Good job, Romeo.
-MARYANNE: Yeah!

270
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,622
-PROBST: Come on over, Romeo.
-MIKE: Yeah, Romeo.

271
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,626
The second person
I'm gonna pick is Maryanne.

272
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,728
She's been struggling, and
I think she could use a meal.

273
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,764
-PROBST: Come on over, Maryanne.
-Thank you.

274
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,334
PROBST:
One spot left,
so either Lindsay,

275
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,303
Mike or Jonathan is going
to join you,

276
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,905
and the other two will not.

277
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,307
For me, at this point, honestly,

278
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,943
it's really about who I think

279
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,312
would benefit from it the most,
and I want the other two

280
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,681
to eat all of our rice today.

281
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,816
So, Mike, come and eat
some chocolate cake.

282
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,252
-(applause)
-LINDSAY: Nice job, Mike.
-Thank.. thank you.

283
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,254
-Thank you, Omar.
-OMAR: You're welcome.

284
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,657
PROBST:
All right,
everybody heading back to camp.

285
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,692
You four are gonna have
a nice, decadent afternoon.

286
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,494
You two, got nothing for you.

287
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,030
-Thank you, Mr. Jeff.
-Thanks, Jeff.
-OMAR: Thank you.

288
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,098
-Nice job.
-Thank you.

289
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>To win a</i> Survivor<i> challenge?</i>

290
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,936
It felt like I was
at the top of the world.

291
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,306
<i>But the caveat is</i>
<i>which reward I picked.</i>

292
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,441
You know, it changes the number
of people you bring with you.

293
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,944
<i>So, for me, I thought</i>
<i>it would go a longer way</i>

294
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,712
<i>towards building relationships,</i>

295
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,148
<i>giving more people</i>
<i>some sustenance, and I hope</i>

296
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,417
there's no backlash
to the decision I made.

297
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,866
-OMAR: Wow.
-ROMEO: Wow.

298
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,401
MIKE:
Omar, you take the first,
whatever you want, pal.

299
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,070
-OMAR: Holy cow.
-MARYANNE: Uh, cheers.

300
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,471
-ROMEO: Wait. Cheers.
-MIKE: Cheers.
-OMAR: Cheers.

301
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,340
-Cheers. Thank you, Omar.
-You're welcome.

302
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,309
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

303
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,279
<i>OMAR: Today's reward challenge</i>
<i>was exhilarating because</i>

304
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,948
I just won a<i> Survivor</i> challenge,
which I never thought

305
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,783
I would ever do in my life.

306
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,151
ROMEO:
Come on.

307
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,653
MARYANNE:
Mm-hmm.

308
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,122
Romeo, I'm very happy for you.

309
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,323
-MARYANNE: Mm-hmm.
-Thank you for bringing me back

310
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,958
-from the dead.
-(laughter)

311
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,461
-OMAR: Well, you-you deserve it.
-Mm-hmm.

312
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,529
Everybody here deserves it.
I just feel bad for them.

313
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,964
I know how... gassed
Jonathan is,

314
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,733
and Lindsay chose me
for the other one.

315
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,270
But I was like
"I'm just trying to be fair."

316
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,438
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>Mike and Jonathan are</i>

317
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,341
<i>two very open targets</i>
<i>that I want out of the game.</i>

318
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,677
<i>So leaving Jonathan behind</i>
<i>at camp was</i>

319
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,445
maybe to deprive him
a little bit,

320
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,347
make him less energetic
for tomorrow's challenge

321
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,149
'cause I need to beat him.

322
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,856
No, I'm not bitter at all.
I understand the reason.

323
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,858
He's going to try
to get them comfortable.

324
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:29,628
-Mm-hmm.
-And then
blindside Mike is the plan.

325
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,664
That's what I'm thinking.

326
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,601
I didn't get
any confirmation on that,

327
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,503
but I assume
that would be the plan.

328
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,873
<i>JONATHAN:</i>
<i>When Lindsay and I are</i>
<i>discussing the vote over rice,</i>

329
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,543
<i>we are obviously trying</i>
<i>to fool each other.</i>

330
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,680
<i>And right now</i>
<i>Mike and I are very tight, but</i>

331
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,848
I don't think Lindsay really
wants to vote for Mike. No.

332
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,850
I think she would much rather
vote me out

333
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,953
<i>because I'm a bigger threat</i>
<i>when it comes to challenges.</i>

334
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,023
<i>So I'm just trying</i>
<i>to get her comfortable,</i>

335
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,626
<i>and she's trying</i>
<i>to get me comfortable.</i>

336
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,461
Hopefully, I'm doing
a better job than she's doing

337
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,097
because I know
that she's up to something.

338
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,432
-I'm gonna lay down.
-Okay.

339
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,434
-Take it easy.
-Okay.

340
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,536
<i>Jonathan thinks</i>
<i>that Mike is going home.</i>

341
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,705
<i>That's great because</i>

342
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,773
people actually
want Jonathan out first.

343
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,476
<i>The only thing that's going</i>
<i>to be a real challenge is, like,</i>

344
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,044
if Jonathan wins immunity,
Mike is abs...

345
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,546
is absolutely the target.

346
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,880
Hi!

347
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,283
<i>So I need him</i>
<i>to feel comfortable</i>

348
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,384
<i>that it's Jonathan going home.</i>

349
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,853
(insects buzzing)

350
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,991
-Am I safe?
-It has to be Jonathan,

351
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,259
is basically what needs
to happen.

352
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,928
Okay. Am I safe?

353
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,629
-I'm asking you straight up.
-I'm ask...

354
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,064
I'm telling you, if it's...

355
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,600
If Jonathan doesn't win,
you are safe.

356
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,336
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Am I feeling safe?</i>
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

357
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,438
I have to go with my gut.
My gut says

358
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,841
<i>Omar is now gunning for me.</i>

359
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,243
-You are the next biggest threat
after Jonathan.
-Okay.

360
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,146
That-that's how some people
feel. Me and Omar don't.

361
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,615
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>And Lindsay-- she's playing</i>
<i>the game with-with Omar.</i>

362
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,117
<i>I can't be 100%</i>

363
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,785
positive, but I can't see
how they're not.

364
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,153
I'll let you know
if you need to use your idol,

365
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,088
-uh, tomorrow night.
-Okay.

366
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,162
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>In talking with Lindsay,</i>
<i>it clicked in my head.</i>

367
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,497
Lindsay has an idol.
When Drea went out,

368
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,665
her-her amulet became
a full idol.

369
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,601
You... How long can
you-you... you can use...?

370
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,870
Okay.

371
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,872
<i>So at this point, I have</i>
<i>to obviously protect myself.</i>

372
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,675
<i>So I think my best move now</i>
<i>is to tell Jonathan and Maryanne</i>

373
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,345
<i>that Lindsay has an idol and</i>

374
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,212
make sure they're on my side.

375
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,552
Uh-uh.

376
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:37,923
Mm-hmm.

377
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,328
Mm-hmm.

378
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,165
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Anybody has to win this one</i>
<i>except for Lindsay</i>

379
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,034
<i>or Omar, of course, because</i>

380
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,003
what if she says, "Let me keep
my alliance strong with Omar.

381
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,872
"I'll give him my idol,

382
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,542
<i>and now we're both safe"?</i>
<i>That would be</i>

383
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,877
a very, very big damper
on my plans.

384
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,346
-And so, if they take me out
first, guess who's next.
-Me.

385
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,482
-If they take you out first,
guess who's next.
-You.

386
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,153
-'Cause...
-Exactly.

387
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,558
Mm-hmm.

388
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,093
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

389
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,862
Mm-hmm.

390
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,664
<i>This vote is extremely huge</i>
<i>for me.</i>

391
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,098
<i>Maryanne has two votes,</i>

392
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,900
so we need to work together.

393
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,102
<i>And I'm thinking,</i>
<i>"I'll make a deal with you.</i>

<i>"If you save my life</i>

"and help me get to five,

00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,242
that'll help me and you
get to four."

397
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,410
The oldest and the youngest.

398
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,545
-The bookends.
-The bookends.

399
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,280
<i>MARYANNE:</i>
<i>So, Mike tells me that he wants</i>

400
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,217
to play his idol
for me at the final five.

401
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,118
<i>But I already have an idol.</i>

402
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,555
And I'm here like,
"Are you kidding me?"

403
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,358
<i>This means</i>
<i>that I'm double safe, so</i>

404
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,860
I'm on for this plan for Omar.

405
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,628
Like, we have to get him out
as soon as we can,

406
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,763
and that means
at the next vote.

407
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,765
And even if he wins immunity,
we still have the votes.

408
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,767
Right. Who...?
Yeah, who do we go for then?

409
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,402
-This we have to talk about.
-Um...

410
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,871
Uh, Jonathan's on our side.

411
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,239
Then Lindsay? 'Cause, look...

412
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,374
No, Lindsay has immunity.

413
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,042
Lindsay has immunity?

414
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,515
-For final six?
-Yes. It's only good
till final six.

415
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,150
No.

416
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,058
<i>MARYANNE:</i>
<i>So, Mike tells me</i>

<i>which is a hidden immunity idol.</i>

418

and the only thing you will have
to do with the million dollars

is deciding who gets it.

455
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,682

-Yeah!
-Absolutely.

-We'll draw for spots.
We'll get started.

460
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,800
Survivors ready. Go!

461
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,636
First you're going
over these obstacles.

462
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,605
(grunting)

463
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,674
Doesn't matter how.
Just get over 'em.

464
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,309
Jonathan in the lead,
Lindsay on his tail.

465
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,511
There goes Mike.

466
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,449
Now you're untying the steps

467
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,984
you need
to build your staircase.

468
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,521
They're in batches of four.

469
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:06,625
Jonathan's out first
with his first four planks.

470
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,327
Everybody's getting
their planks together now.

471
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,662
We're tight early on.

472
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,365
Jonathan in a bit
of an early lead.

473
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,500
Here comes Romeo. Look at that!

474
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,737
Lindsay. Here comes Mike.
Now we got Omar.

475
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,373
-Let's go, Maryanne.
-(grunting)

476
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,678
They will go in one of the first
four spots on your staircase.

477
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:30,348
The question is,
which spots do they go in?

478
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:34,386
This is where
time is gained or lost.

479
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,022
And look at that.
Lindsay now in the lead.

480
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,224
She's getting
her next batch of pieces.

481
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,394
There goes Maryanne.
Omar's in on it.

482
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,097
Jonathan falling behind now.
He lost the lead.

483
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,898
There goes Mike.

484
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,101
Lindsay has her next four.
She's heading back.

485
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,037
Omar has his next four.
He's heading back.

486
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,507
Jonathan has his untied.

487
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,077
The next four pieces go
in the next four steps.

488
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,513
Jonathan is back.
Here comes Mike.

489
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,849
First you have to get
the pieces.

490
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,417
Then you have
to solve the puzzle.

491
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,188
He heads out.
Lindsay now heads out.

492
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,258
It's Omar and Lindsay
right now side by side.

493
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,293
Jonathan's done.
He's heading back.

494
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,429
Mike's good.

495
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,434
Omar, in the lead, continues.

496
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,737
He's back first.
Lindsay right behind.

497
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,205
Jonathan trying to get in on it.

498
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,509
It's day 23 of<i> Survivor 42.</i>

499
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,811
-Six players left.
-(Lindsay groans)

500
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,913
You got to step up,
or you go home.

00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,210
MARYANNE:
Flame.

671
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,213
<i>Right now, I'm feeling that</i>
<i>Omar can win this whole thing.</i>

672
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,014
<i>And that's not a feeling</i>
<i>that I want to have.</i>

673
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,015
JONATHAN:
Flame on.

674
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,750
<i>MARYANNE:</i>
<i>I feel dejected,</i>

675
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,452
<i>but I want to show that I'm here</i>

676
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,087
<i>to play my game,</i>
<i>and I'm here to win.</i>

677
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,790
<i>I have my extra vote.</i>

678
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:00,225
<i>I can go with</i>
<i>Omar and Lindsay's plan</i>

679
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,093
<i>and use my extra vote</i>

680
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,930
the way they want me to,
or I can go with my plan

681
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,466
<i>and use my extra vote</i>
<i>the way I want to.</i>

682
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,069
<i>So there's a chance</i>
<i>that this plan to take out Omar</i>

683
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,737
-can still happen.
<i>-Listen to me.</i>

684
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:13,605
Okay.

685
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,942
This is our time to take a risk,
but a big move.

686
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,777
-Okay. Okay.
-This is what
you're going to do, okay?

687
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,913
You're going to tell Jonathan,
"Vote Omar."

688
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,048
Then...

689
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,451
-I know for a fact Jonathan
is voting Romeo with me.
-Mm-hmm.

690
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,988
-Okay.
-And if you throw two votes
Romeo, and I vote Romeo,

691
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,823
there's nothing anybody can do.

692
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,825
Omar's next one. He has no,
he has no protection.

693
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,160
-It's me, you...
-But what if he wins tomorrow?

694
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,462
I want to vote for Omar.

695
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,133
<i>I could use my idol</i>
<i>tonight, but</i>

696
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,935
it's not gonna happen.

697
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,671
<i>I need my idol tomorrow</i>
<i>to make sure that I get to four.</i>

698
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,906
It's my life. My life's hanging
on the balance.

699
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,742
I'm putting my life
in your hands. Please.

700
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,809
MARYANNE:
I can't promise you right now.

701
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,312
I still need to think about it.
That's the thing.

702
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,114
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Lindsay wins</i>
<i>the immunity challenge.</i>

703
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,149
She doesn't need
her immunity idol.

704
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,985
<i>I'm thinking Lindsay</i>
<i>gives Omar her immunity idol.</i>

705
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,688
<i>It would make them both safe.</i>

706
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,992
<i>So the easy thing is,</i>
<i>put four votes on Romeo.</i>

707
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,595
<i>Simple, except Maryanne</i>

708
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,632
<i>wants to play</i> Survivor<i> 18.0,</i>
<i>instead of 2.0.</i>

709
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,668
<i>And having my fate</i>
<i>in her hands</i>

710
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,102
is scary.

711
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,470
-But you're not voting
for me, right?
-I'm not.

712
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,605
Okay.

713
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,140
-I'm not.
-Okay.

714
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,175
Like, I gave you my word,
and I'm keeping my word.

715
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,810
-Okay.
<i>-MARYANNE: Mike is just trying</i>
<i>to play it safe,</i>

716
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,046
<i>'cause people can feel</i>
<i>the final five.</i>

717
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,514
<i>And when people can feel it,</i>
<i>and they don't have</i>

718
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,382
<i>that necklace on their neck,</i>
<i>they get paranoid.</i>

719
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,185
<i>But I have my extra vote,</i>

720
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,555
and my two votes
give me a lot of power tonight.

721
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,857
Nothing from this
conversation can leak.

722
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,025
-Nothing.
-I swear.

723
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,593
-We have six votes.
-Yes.

724
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,131
(gasps)

725
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,135
-Oh, my God.
-Used... And it has to be used
this Tribal.

726
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,372
So that means
that us four are five votes.

727
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,074
This is what we need to do.

728
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,811
Me, you, Jonathan, Mike

729
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,612
vote Omar,
because Omar will win.

730
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,317
<i>I think I have Romeo on board,</i>
<i>but I still have</i>

731
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,885
a lot of work to do.

732
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:08,886
-This is simple.
-Mm-hmm.

733
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,988
You two do Romeo.

734
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,657
Romeo and I do Omar.

735
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,158
-That is three.
-You do your two?

736
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,993
Yeah, I will do two on Omar.

737
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,595
-Okay, do we trust Romeo
to vote Omar?
-Okay.

738
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,198
I do. I've talked to him.
I literally trust him.

739
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,933
<i>JONATHAN:</i>
<i>I'm not confident in Romeo</i>
<i>at all.</i>

740
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,235
<i>And he's been</i>
<i>very back and forth</i>

741
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,703
throughout the whole game.

742
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,706
<i>And if he votes me, then</i>
<i>I could go home.</i>

743
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,109
So I think
it would be a dumb move

744
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,610
<i>not to vote out Romeo.</i>

745
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,045
MIKE:
So here's my question.

746
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,013
Is it best we just go along
with whatever they say

747
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,348
to all of us,

748
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,717
and we silently
throw our votes on Romeo?

749
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,019
Then we're all guaranteed
to be here tomorrow,

750
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,721
and then we get Omar
tomorrow night.

751
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,256
-And then, and then...
no, no, listen to me.
-Oh, my God.

752
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,625
<i>MARYANNE:</i>
<i>Jonathan and Mike</i>
<i>are underestimating me.</i>

00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,194
<i>I'm trying to play</i>
<i>a good move to take out Omar,</i>

754
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,096
<i>-and they're just</i>
<i>not getting it.</i>
-Look.

755
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,233
If we all vote for Romeo,
Romeo is gone,

756
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,235
but then our way to the end
is more difficult.

757
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,137
This is a risk
that we have to take.

758

<i>I'm going guns blazing to go</i>

760

762

that last Tribal Council

-PROBST: It's coming.

784

It matches the intensity

Quite frankly, I'm at the point
now, this is past calculus.

There's nowhere to hide,

787

790
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,234
You know she's not going home.

791
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,970
What was the feeling today?

792
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,839
I think the dynamic
is changing a little bit.

793
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,709
I think people are
starting to think about

794
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,911
who they might want to sit
next to in the final three,

795
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,313
as opposed to who they want
to vote off next.

796
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,815
So it's different thinking.

797
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,351
It's a different feel,
and I think people are thinking

798
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,520
more long-term
than short-term now.

799
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,687
PROBST:
Lindsay,
do you concur with that?

800
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,357
That maybe
the shift is happening?

801
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,092
Absolutely. He's-- was spot-on.

802
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,527
Uh, like, at this point,

803
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,196
you're kind of figuring out
what are my best odds

804
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,998
to feel the most comfortable
in the final three.

805
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,202
So then, Omar, what does that do
in terms of who is the threat?

806
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,037
Who do I need to get out?

807
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,006
OMAR:
I don't know if I agree
with either of them,

808
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,140
to be honest.

809
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,142
I think people have been
playing for the long-term game

810
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,410
since the beginning.

811
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,811
Some of the people there,

812
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,813
you know, they may have
been trustworthy allies,

813
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,049
but people didn't want
to go to the end with them.

814
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,250
And that's why they're there.

815
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,419
So I think
that that trend will continue.

816
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,754
It's just that
there's fewer people

817
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,055
and less room to hide now.

818
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,057
PROBST:
Maryanne,
where do you sit on that?

819
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,592
Is there a shift happening?

820
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,827
MARYANNE:
I feel as if it depends

821
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,397
on where your position
was in the tribe.

822
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,098
If you're someone
who's on the bottom,

823
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,034
you might be thinking, "No, I
have to think self-preservation,

824
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,436
self-preservation."
And when you finally feel

825
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,704
a little bit more wiggle room,
that's when you're like,

826
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,006
"Okay, now I can think
about the endgame."

827
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,244
Lindsay, how confident are you
about tonight's vote?

828
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,212
I-I feel confident
in tonight's vote

829
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,614
with the discussions
that I've had.

830
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,216
So it's really more so
if they feel equally

831
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,118
as confident
that I was being honest

832
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,587
with what my discussion was.

833
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,856
Mike, that's
a very honest answer

834

to actually say, "I'm good.

835
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,227
"I don't know if
the other people will trust me,

836
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,963
and if they don't,
it might not go my way."

837
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,432
I-I live my life on trust.

838
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,401
I trust who I put my, uh,
fate in their hands

839
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,369
and their fate in my hands.

840
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,104
I trust in who I believe in.

841
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,040
PROBST:
Omar, what'd you read
into Lindsay's answer?

842
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,575
I mean,
I think that answer is...

843
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,810
just sums up
the game of<i> Survivor.</i>

844
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,912
You never know if
what you say to other people

845
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,749
is gonna be taken with truth
or with a falsity.

846
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,718
If I'm telling you something,
and you don't believe me,

847
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,152
then you could
change everything up.

848
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:39,123
So I'm<i> Survivor</i> confident
in what's gonna happen tonight,

849
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,159
but every time you're<i> Survivor</i>
confident, you could be wrong.

850
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,160
So I'm open to that, too.

851
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,464
PROBST:
So, Jonathan, if you're right,

852
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,666
and the vote goes the way
you want it to go,

853
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,068
what impact will it have
when you guys get back to camp?

854
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,737
JONATHAN:
Like, if it works out,

855
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,641
nobody lies, and everything
is all hunky-dory,

856
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,843
then that'll be the first Tribal
where that's ever happened.

857
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,078
It's not that easy.

858
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,414
Something is happening where
somebody's being lied to.

859
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,183
There is gonna be people
that keep their trust,

860
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,419
and there are gonna be people
that lie.

861
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,621
Lindsay, do you agree with that?

862
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,822
I mean,
unless it's a clean sweep,

863
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,691
then, yeah, somebody else
will definitely be upset.

864
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,593
And usually, I don't think
there's been a clean sweep yet.

865
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,594
MARYANNE:
Mm-mm.

866
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:17,762
Not with the Shot in the Dark.

867
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,363
Why?

868
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,798
'Cause, like, you don't know
who's gonna play it.

869
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,133
This is the last time
we can play it.

870
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,002
And then, also,
there's idols in this game, too.

871
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,171
So then, after, if you're trying
to do a clean sweep, and then

872
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,674
that person who you're doing
a clean sweep for has an idol,

873
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,842
then you're up the river, too,
'cause that person chooses.

874
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,377
You can never do
a clean sweep anymore.

875
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,446
And, Omar, the tricky part
about that is,

876
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,448
when there's only
six people voting anyway,

877
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,984
if you start splitting votes,
it gets very scary.

878
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,320
Yeah, and, I mean, there's
definitely the possibility

879
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,989
of a hidden immunity idol
coming out,

880
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,159
so we have to be really careful
if we don't have one.

881
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,827
I don't have one,

882
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,529
so I'm extra nervous
when you call out for

883
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,497
"Does anyone have
an advantage to play?"

884
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,966
Because I could be on the
receiving end of a blindside.

885
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,306
