1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,419
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>Survivor,</i> Dreamz had to decide

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,256
between two alliances: the four

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,299
horsemen or Earl, Yau-Man, and

5
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,968
Cassandra.

6
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:10,593
>> I can never tell how the game

7
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,721
is going to go, so I'm going to

8
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,432
just see how it plays out.

9
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,516
>> PROBST: First, Dreamz warned

10
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,809
Alex that he was on the chopping

11
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:18,601
block.

12
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,310
>> Alex, your name's going to

13
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,061
come up tomorrow.

14
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,271
>> PROBST: But Earl caught

15
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,355
Dreamz red handed.

16
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,106
>> You know I heard what y'all

17
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,523
was saying, right?

18
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:24,190
>> PROBST: Feeling the pressure

19
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,401
from Earl's alliance, Dreamz

20
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,569
dropped a bomb about the four

21
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:28,737
horsemen.

22
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,487
>> Mookie's got an immunity

23
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,822
idol.

24
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,198
>> There are two hidden immunity

25
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,950
idols.

26
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,452
The one in the Moto camp was dug

27
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,412
up by me.

28
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,913
>> PROBST: In their first

29
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,540
individual immunity challenge...

30
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,541
Yau-Man looks like he could go

31
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,834
all day.

32
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,002
...Yau-Man obliterated the

33
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,044
competition.

34
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,212
Boo is out of the challenge.

35
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,797
Yau-Man wins first individual

36
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,133
immunity.

37
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,093
Before tribal council....

38
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:52,677
>> Mookie wants to get rid of

39
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,970
Earl first.

40
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:54,804
Are you in?

41
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,597
>> PROBST: ...Alex tried to

42
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,973
recruit Stacy to join the four

43
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:57,724
horsemen...

44
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,558
>> I'm just hot.

45
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,809
I'm really agitated.

46
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,560
>> She was like, "I'm just

47
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,269
tired.

48
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:01,770
I'm just hot right now."

49
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,395
>> That means that she's not in,

50
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,813
dude.

51
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,481
>> PROBST: ...which put Alex at

52
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,148
risk.

53
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:05,815
>> I can save Alex by giving him

54
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,484
the immunity idol, but this

55
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,401
early in the game to use the

56
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,235
immunity idol is kind of a

57
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:09,569
disadvantage.

58
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,236
>> PROBST: Mookie reluctantly

59
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,530
passed his hidden immunity idol

60
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,282
to Alex in order to save him.

61
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,408
>> It's going to work, Mook.

62
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,201
It's going to work.

63
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:16,826
>> PROBST: And together, they

64
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,327
targeted Cassandra.

65
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,120
>> This is an all-or-nothing

66
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,163
move.

67
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,164
If it works out, it'll probably

68
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,374
be one of the best moves ever.

69
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,751
>> Mookie gave Alex the idol.

70
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,794
>> PROBST: Dreamz let his new

71
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,086
alliance know of the four

72
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,254
horsemen's plan.

73
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,172
>> He gave it to him?

74
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,215
>> I promise.

75
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,343
>> Listen-- Mookie, Mookie.

76
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,637
Mookie gave the idol to Alex, so

77
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,222
we're going to vote Mookie just

78
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,723
to catch them off guard.

79
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,766
>> Why don't we vote off

80
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,558
Edgardo?

81
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,434
>> PROBST: But unwilling to

82
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,477
fully trust Dreamz, the vote

83
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,228
switched to Edgardo.

84
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,312
>> If we hit them with Edgardo,

85
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,189
that hits them from the left

86
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:46,397
side.

87
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,357
>> Yeah, I've thought about it.

88
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,191
>> PROBST: And at tribal

89
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,276
council, Alex confidently played

90
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,861
Mookie's idol.

91
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,946
Alex is immune from tonight's

92
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,447
vote.

93
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,240
Alex, Mookie, and Edgardo were

94
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,117
certain their plan was working,

95
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:58,618
but when the votes were

96
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,327
revealed...

97
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,371
Tenth person voted out and the

98
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,705
fourth member of our jury...

99
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,289
...the rug was pulled out from

100
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,667
under them, and Edgardo was

101
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,043
voted out.

102
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:10,004
Edgardo, the tribe has spoken.

103
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,548
Eight are left.

104
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:27,856
Who will be voted out tonight?

105
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:38,116
>> Yeah.

106
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,409
>> I thought Dreamz would be

107
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,077
more on par with the four

108
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:41,703
horsemen alliance, but I guess

109
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,912
not.

110
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,621
He's the one that turned and

111
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,497
back-stabbed us.

112
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,250
I mean, it hurts.

113
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,814
>> Everybody made a pact to vote

114
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,691
out Mookie, and then all of a

115
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,277
sudden they switched to Edgardo.

116
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,903
So I was the only one who voted

117
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,445
Mookie.

118
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,446
At first I felt like they didn't

119
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,865
trust me, but then they came to

120
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,449
me and they let me know that

121
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,576
they just changed it just in

122
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,952
case Mookie pulled out the

123
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,286
immunity idol.

124
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,455
And I was comfortable after

125
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,540
that.

126
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,502
>> That was brilliant.

127
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,046
Now the power is pretty much on

128
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,465
our side, and I feel good.

129
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,383
There ain't no more secrets now.

130
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,844
We're actually six strong, and

131
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,137
there's two people just waiting

132
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,890
on death row.

133
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:31,729
(<i> theme song playing</i> )

134
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,355
>> ...come over and say

135
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,189
something.

136
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:33,815
>> Like "Hey, guys, you know,

137
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,774
like, it's a game."

138
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:45,618
>> A true traitor.

139
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,411
>> Why are y'all not hanging out

140
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,412
no more?

141
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,497
>> Why do you think?

142
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,709
>> I'm still hanging out.

143
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,293
>> We all got outwitted?

144
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,169
What are you talking about?

145
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:55,795
>> We all got outsmarted last

146
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,547
night.

147
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,589
>> Dude, you turned on us.

148
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,049
>> No, I didn't turn on y'all.

149
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:00,800
>> How do you figure?

150
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:01,592
>> I didn't turn on y'all.

151
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,719
>> There were three votes for

152
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,012
Cassandra.

153
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,471
>> No, I didn't turn on y'all.

154
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,265
That's not even in me.

155
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:07,890
>> Why didn't you go with

156
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,933
Cassandra anyway?

157
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:09,600
>> Why didn't I go with

158
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,018
Cassandra anyway?

159
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,102
>> Yeah, that would have been a

160
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:11,894
4-4 split.

161
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,603
>> It would have been 4-4, and

162
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,104
that was the end of it.

163
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:13,730
We said Cassandra, and that was

164
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,064
it.

165
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:15,732
>> That was the end of it.

166
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,357
As soon as you voted for

167
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,275
Edgardo, that was the end of us.

168
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,234
>> What?

169
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,277
>> Or you voted for me?

170
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,236
>> Who'd you vote for, Mookie or

171
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:20,987
Edgardo?

172
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,946
>> I voted Mookie.

173
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,406
I didn't throw Mookie's random

174
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,033
name out randomly and turn on

175
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,117
y'all.

176
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,701
But I knew once they had us

177
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,577
gone, it's me trying to go with

178
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,411
them.

179
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,371
It's not me turning on y'all

180
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,500
ever, ever.

181
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,252
I walked over to Mookie and Alex

182
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:36,836
and said, "I guess we just got

183
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,338
outplayed," because I want them

184
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,465
to think that it wasn't my fault

185
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,925
that it happened.

186
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,218
I pretty much told them a story

187
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,137
about me not knowing about what

188
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,805
was going on.

189
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,599
I didn't turn.

190
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,183
>> That's the only thing that

191
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:50,600
was upsetting to me.

192
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,603
If I get jacked, I get jacked.

193
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,229
But to be turned on, I was like,

194
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,064
"Man, I can't believe that guy

195
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,023
turned on me."

196
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,566
>> I didn't go, "Oh, yeah, Alex

197
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,484
got the immunity idol, don't

198
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,111
vote for him; vote for Edgardo."

199
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,154
>> Is there a way out of this

200
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,989
right now?

201
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:05,615
>> One of y'all win the

202
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,532
challenge.

203
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,116
All y'all can do now is win

204
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,327
challenges.

205
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,286
As fast as I'm trying to get

206
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:10,870
them out of here, I still want

207
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,621
to be their friends, because I'm

208
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,414
going to need their vote in the

209
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:13,956
future if I one of the final

210
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,249
two.

211
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,084
I got a headache and everything

212
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,252
at tribal council.

213
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:35,603
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

214
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,939
For today's challenge, you're

215
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:38,648
going to be randomly divided

216
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,734
into two teams.

217
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,610
One person from each team will

218
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,862
be on a platform.

219
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,739
You will be launching balls out

220
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,949
into the field, where your

221
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,118
teammates will run, slide, or

222
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,495
dive in the mud, attempting to

223
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,038
catch the ball using a catch

224
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:54,539
basket.

225
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,833
Each time you catch a ball, you

226
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,501
score a point.

227
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,085
It doesn't matter what color

228
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,962
ball you catch.

229
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,380
You catch a ball, you score a

230
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,631
point.

231
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,217
First team to five wins reward.

232
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,301
Want to know what you're playing

233
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:07,969
for?

234
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,053
>> Yeah!

235
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,972
>> PROBST: Some items to get you

236
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,515
nice and clean.

237
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,767
Trust me, all eight of you need

238
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,894
this desperately.

239
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,479
You will not take this back to

240
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,064
camp to get clean, though.

241
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,315
You will take this basket.

242
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,900
You will board a seaplane.

243
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,693
The seaplane will fly you to a

244
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,196
luxury spa resort.

245
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,322
>> Oh, God.

246
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,198
>> Thank you.

247
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,032
>> PROBST: When you arrive,

248
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,033
you'll take a shower, put this

249
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,161
Olay ribbons body wash to use.

250
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,829
You'll then spend the night, get

251
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:35,997
a good night's sleep in a bed,

252
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,540
return to camp in the morning.

253
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,667
In addition, the winning team

254
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,668
will send one person from the

255
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,422
losing team to Exile Island.

256
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,590
The person who goes to Exile

257
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,716
will find a new clue to the

258
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,843
location of the hidden immunity

259
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,429
idol, which has been rehidden

260
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,972
since Alex played it at the last

261
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,266
tribal council.

262
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,058
All right, we're going to

263
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,018
randomly draw for teams, and

264
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,103
we'll get started.

265
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,524
Here we go.

266
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,609
For the orange team, it is

00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,112
Yau-Man launching balls to Boo,

268
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,740

For the green team, launching

270
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,076
the balls is Stacy.

271
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,786
Out in the field, it is Dreamz,

272
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,539
Earl, and Alex.

273
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,040
Let's get this challenge

274
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,375

275
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:26,214
Three, two, one, fire.

Yau-Man launches deep, nobody

277
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,633

Everybody going for it.

283
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,015
loses it-- no points.

284
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:36,724
>> I didn't know they bounced

285
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,100
like that.

00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,284
>> PROBST: Quickly, orange leads

293
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,662

Alex makes a diving attempt but

296
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,383
cannot hold on to it.

297
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,718
>> Good try.

298
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,761

299
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,471

00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,629
>> Yau, patience.

382
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,088
Just watch the break.

383
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,340
>> PROBST: Three, two, one,

384
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,968
fire.

385
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,552
Yau-Man goes right back to the

386
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,804
same target.

387
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,805
Alex steals it for the green

388
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,891
team.

389
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,354
Stacy goes deep for Dreamz.

390
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,731
Boo with the good deflection,

391
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,024
does not score.

392
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,901
We are tied 4-4.

393
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,986
Next catch wins it.

394
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,989
Three, two, one, launch.

395
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,120
Boo has a shot at it, just

396
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,038
misses.

397
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,957
>> Dreamz!

398
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,962
>> PROBST: Dreamz has it.

399
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,255
Green scores!

400
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,925
Green wins reward!

401
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,220
Earl, Dreamz, Alex, and Stacy

402
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,971
going on a spa reward.

403
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,228
All right first big decision,

404
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,438
Alex, Stacy, Dreamz, and Earl,

405
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,731
you have to send one person to

406
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,525
Exile Island.

407
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,359
>> Boo.

408
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,109
>> He's been living the life of

409
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:39,860
luxury since he's been here, so

410
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,195
he has to go.

411
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,613
>> PROBST: Boo, head on out.

412
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,739
The boat will pick you up.

413
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,074
>> Good luck, Boo.

414
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,326
>> PROBST: Big reward.

415
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,827
>> Big, huge!

416
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,453
>> PROBST: Come grab your stuff.

417
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,205
Head on out this way.

418
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,206
The seaplane will pick you up.

419
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:52,540
>> Right now?

420
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,707
>> PROBST: You're going dirty,

421
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,167
just like this.

422
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,472
>> "The idol is back at your

423
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,599
very own beach.

424
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,685
It's close to a singular tree

425
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,520
and easy to reach."

426
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,604
It's not here.

427
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,564
It's not my beach.

428
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,690
That makes it a lot easier for

429
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,857
me here, because I don't want to

430
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,775
do anything.

431
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:20,985
I hurt my knee, and it's

432
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,070
painful.

433
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm out of water right now.

434
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,533
I'm nearing heat exhaustion.

435
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,367
Man, I cannot be in the sun

436
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,034
anymore.

437
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,370
I'm going to die.

438
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,380
>> It's great.

439
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,423
The first thing I'm going to do

440
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,507
when I get to this reward is see

441
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,633
if I can wiggle my way back into

442
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,844
this alliance.

443
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,012
I mean, I'm certainly in a bad

444
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,888
position, and I feel like odds

445
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,848
are against me.

446
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,557
>> Bula-Bula!

447
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,558
>> Bula-Bula!

448
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,475
>> Bula!

449
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,476
>> But, hey, I'm definitely

450
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,895
going to give it my all.

451
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,738
>> Hey, let's go ahead and get

452
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,572
sexy back.

453
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,657
We got the showers.

454
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,328
>> There's, like, so much dirt

455
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,204
in so many places, I don't know

456
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,789
what to do.

457
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,000
>> Warm water.

458
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,420
>> Oh, wow, this feels great.

459
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,047
>> I have mud under my arms.

460
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,383
How crazy is that?

461
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,635
Mud!

462
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,846
>> Time to Olay-- Olay, Olay.

463
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,765
Oh, my God, I'm clean again,

464
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,850
like human.

465
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,643
>> I don't know, Alex.

466
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,393
I think I'm getting my sexy

467
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,687
back.

468
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,356
>> Thank you very much.

469
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,690
>> Thank you.

470
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,816
>> Looks good, smells good.

471
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,735
>> Enjoy.

472
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,070
>> Getting the reward was good,

473
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:46,987
and it was definitely good for

474
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,114
morale.

475
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:49,698
>> I'm going to do the cheese

476
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,617
platter and that as well.

477
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,242
>> But it was extremely awkward

478
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,536
to have Alex there.

479
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,329
>> I mean, you've seen how I

480
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,038
play this game.

481
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,164
Whether I win or lose, I

482
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,540
congratulate the other team, and

483
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,208
I try to minimize, like, the

484
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,126
showboating.

485
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,212
>> Sometimes.

486
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,175
>> A lion is most dangerous when

487
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,094
he's wounded and backed up

488
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:10,469
against a wall.

489
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,262
That's how I feel, because I'm

490
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,306
clearly on the chopping block.

491
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,182
So if I can buy myself a couple

492
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,893
people off, that might give me

493
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:18,394
more time to try to maybe

494
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,523
infiltrate the alliance.

495
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,232
>> Yeah!

496
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,358
>> Yeah!

497
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,234
So can I ask you a question,

498
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:25,442
Earl?

499
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,735
>> Sure.

500
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,861
>> So what's the order, Mookie

501
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,364
and I?

502
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,240
>> That information probably

503
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,617
wouldn't be revealed, because

504
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,202
the game isn't over.

505
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,078
>> Fair enough.

506
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:36,495
>> Can't be stupid.

507
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,080
>> Fair enough.

508
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:38,664
>> I'm assuming you want to go

509
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,790
second.

510
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,334
>> I think Mookie wants to go.

511
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,298
>> Sounds reasonable to me.

512
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,718
But I've come to terms with the

513
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,343
way I've played the game so far,

514
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,345
and I'm happy.

515
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,346
Obviously, I'm at a

516
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,432
disadvantage, but I don't care.

517
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,391
I'm not going down without a

518
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,350
fight, you know, and they the

519
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,184
better be prepared forward me to

520
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,895
bring it at this point.

521
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,828
>> Get out of our seats!

522
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,288
We're ready to get on!

523
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,122
>> So fresh and so clean.

524
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,541
>> We can smell you from here!

525
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,502
>> Clean, washed, pressed.

526
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,336
>> When the people came back

527
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,921
from the spa reward, they

528
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,715
smelled like apples and

529
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,091
strawberries.

530
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:31,508
>> Let me smell you!

531
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,260
Let me smell you!

532
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,554
>> I know, I smell good.

533
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,097
>> Yes, their trip was great,

534
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,640
but I just hate hearing it.

535
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,350
You're back to your standard of

536
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,519
living you're used to, dirt.

537
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,938
At this point, I'm already x'd

538
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,232
out of the equation of everyone,

539
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,193
but even though I seem like I'm

540
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,611
out of the game, I'm just

541
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,695
completely out, my heart is

542
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,988
still going, and my mind is

543
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,324
constantly just thinking.

544
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,579
I think Yau-Man found it.

545
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,331
>> The idol.

546
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,500
>> Yau-Man found it because he's

547
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,375
the only person that's ever at

548
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,502
camp.

549
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,211
>> Ever.

550
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,086
>> Ever.

551
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:08,962
>> Always by the fire.

552
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,088
>> And he's always by the fire,

553
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,006
and he always has time, so he

554
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,716
has it.

555
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,592
When your back is against the

556
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,594
wall, you start being creative.

557
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,262
And I thought, "Hmm, the idol, I

558
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,974
wonder who really has the idol."

559
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,100
So I decided, "Well, Yau-Man's

560
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:22,684
fishing, the first time he's

561
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,269
ever been away from camp; I

562
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,270
might as well go check his bag

563
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,313
to see if there's anything in

564
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,272
there," just being curious.

565
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,443
Where's Yau-Man's bag?

566
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,238
Did he take it with him?

567
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,532
This is it right here?

568
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,741
Yup, he has it.

569
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,325
>> Are you serious?

570
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:38,784
>> Yeah, he's got it.

571
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,077
It's right here.

572
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,371
Look.

573
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,457
>> What can we do with that

574
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,166
information?

575
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,417
Do we blow up his spot?

576
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,293
>> We can do something with this

577
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:48,585
information.

578
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,128
>> We can do something with this

579
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:50,712
information.

580
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,505
Let's go think what is the most

581
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,174
damage we can cause.

582
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,093
>> I'm doing this because you

583
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,886
and me are the last two girls.

584
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,387
>> This is to a long and

585
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,347
prosperous game together.

586
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,891
>> Cheers.

587
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,517
>> That's why you don't hide the

588
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,727
immunity idol in your bag.

589
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,272
(<i> laughter</i> )

590
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:12,734
>> I hear somebody coming.

591
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,944
>> It's Yau-Man's best interest

592
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,112
not to align himself with us,

593
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:15,737
though, because we know he has

594
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,992
it.

595
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:20,868
Because there's no reason why he

596
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,451
would tell anybody yet, right?

597
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,411
>> There's nothing for his

598
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,372
position.

599
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:25,956
How are you going to convince

600
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,874
everyone that Yau-Man has the

601
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,833
idol?

602
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,501
>> Let's think about that.

603
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,544
>> Say, "I went in his bag.

604
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,004
He has the idol."

605
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:32,796
"You guys went fishing, I went

606
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,505
in his bag, he has the idol,

607
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,591
period."

608
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,428
>> He wears those pants to

609
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,263
tribal all the time.

610
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,557
"Yau-Man, do you have the idol?"

611
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,850
He's like, "No, I don't have the

612
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,143
idol."

613
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,102
"Pull your pants out and show

614
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:47,728
everyone here that you have the

615
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,312
idol if you're so confident."

616
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,813
>> Just blow up his spot at

617
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,063
tribal.

618
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,189
>> Right there, be like, "Throw

619
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:51,940
it up."

620
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:52,649
At tribal council, that's

621
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,902
like... if you blew him up on

622
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,111
the spot like that, and he had

623
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:56,695
it in his pocket, and then he

624
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,864
lied to everyone saying he

625
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,656
didn't have it...

626
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,365
>> They would vote with us.

627
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,409
>> Exactly.

628
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,077
>> God, it's going to be so

629
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:04,661
great!

630
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,287
Even if we get voted off, Mook,

631
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,331
it's going to feel so great!

632
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,667
That's going to feel so... ah!

633
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,169
That's going out swinging,

634
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,295
literally a blaze of glory.

635
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,923
>><i> Scarface.</i>

636
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:20,135
>><i> Scarface</i> style.

637
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,762
>> Two great brains working

638
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,805
together, strategizing, we're on

639
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,349
top of the world.

640
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,433
>> Ah, brilliant.

641
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,976
>> We devised this huge plan of

642
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,770
maybe we can bring up the idol

643
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,438
to everyone and surprise them at

644
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,482
tribal council, then people

645
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,484
won't be able to talk to each

646
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,361
other and people will be

647
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:37,986
paranoid; they don't know what

648
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,154
to do.

649
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:39,821
It's going to be an interesting

650
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,073
tribal council, let me tell you

651
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:41,573
that.

652
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,366
>> It is.

653
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,368
(<i> laughter</i> )

654
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:49,289
(<i> twig breaks</i> )

655
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,833
>> What?

656
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,542
>> Stacy and Cassandra are right

657
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,630
there.

658
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,465
>> We're screwed.

659
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,591
That's it.

660
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,051
They're going to tell Yau-Man.

661
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,261
>> There goes that plan.

662
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,596
>> Damn it, dude!

663
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,347
>> Right now the biggest thing

664
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,431
is we need to blow his spot up.

665
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,015
>> We blow up his spot before

666
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,183
tribal council.

667
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,476
>> We blow it up now.

668
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:17,609
>> We got to hurry up and go

669
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,193
there then, before they go.

670
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:21,113
Time to raise some hell.

671
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,496
>> Once I saw Stacy and

672
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,580
Cassandra listening to our

673
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,165
conversation, I came up with a

674
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,792
little idea that if we can get

675
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,501
back to Yau before them and kind

676
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,878
of give him an ultimatum, that

677
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,379
we can somehow use that

678
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,505
information against him in his

679
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,591
alliance.

680
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,054
>> I think they may be a little

681
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,596
paranoid, thinking we were

682
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,641
eavesdropping in on them.

683
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,393
>> Cassandra and I happened to

684
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,230
be sitting nearby where Mookie

685
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:55,689
and Alex were having a

686
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,066
conversation that they spoke

687
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,984
about a few things that we

688
00:21:59,067 --> 00:21:59,735
didn't hear.

689
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,361
We heard, like, words here and

690
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:01,570
there.

691
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,238
So then they went running back

692
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,531
to camp.

693
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,873
>> Now, do you want to tell the

694
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,749
group yourself, or do you want

695
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,541
us to do it?

696
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,626
>> Why do I have the idol?

697
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,300
>> I thought you guys were

698
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,009
getting firewood.

699
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,886
>> No.

700
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:26,511
>> So what do you want to do,

701
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,014
Yau?

702
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:29,681
>> You guys do what you need to

703
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,892
do.

704
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,312
>> Okay, we will.

705
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,439
>> All right.

706
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,440
>> So we go to Yau-Man, and he

707
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,484
was shocked.

708
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,109
I definitely saw it in his eyes,

709
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,652
like, "Holy crap."

710
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,570
He's not going to be able to now

711
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,529
use the idol the way he wanted

712
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,614
to.

713
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,698
So that still makes him more of

714
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,116
a target than it did before.

715
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,368
It'll be interesting, won't it?

716
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,131
>> Earl is the only one who

717
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,841
knows I have the idol.

718
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,802
At this point, it doesn't change

719
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,012
any outcome, because my voting

720
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:09,638
bloc members, we already have

721
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,599
decided, we have the majority to

722
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,184
continue the sequence that we

723
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,019
are going to.

724
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,521
It changed somewhat for me,

725
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,647
personally, because having that

726
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,024
information that early put me at

727
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:21,566
risk.

728
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,444
So I will have to tell all my

729
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,822
voting bloc just straight out.

730
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,626
>> He went through your bag,

731
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,253
Yau-Man?

732
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:41,837
>> He went through my bag.

733
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,587
They're trying to threaten me,

734
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:42,838
basically.

735
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,381
He didn't say that.

736
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,133
He implies that, pretty much.

737
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,176
>> My heart is, like, hurting

738
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,178
right now.

739
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:50,720
Alex went through Yau-Man's

740
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,890
things, his bag, his pants, and

741
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,308
then threatened him.

742
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,518
>> He threatened you?

743
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,727
>> He threatened him and said,

744
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,353
"I know you have the immunity

745
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,564
idol."

746
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,523
>> He looked at me and said, "I

747
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,482
saw it in your pants.

748
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,066
What are you going to do about

749
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,026
it?"

750
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,902
>> Yau went and told everybody

751
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,987
that they went through

752
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,072
everybody's bags and they found

753
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,073
the idol.

754
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,032
>> To go through people's

755
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,659
personal stuff and then to try

756
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,370
to bully you?

757
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,121
>> Yeah.

758
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,455
>> People were pissed that they

759
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,039
went through Yau's personal

760
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,541
things, not about, "Okay, Yau

761
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,877
has the idol."

762
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,627
>> That's dirty.

763
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,920
That's dirty.

764
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,046
>> But it sucked to me just

765
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,256
because someone knew, because I

766
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,465
like keeping everything quiet in

767
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:27,716
general.

768
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,717
That's just... because too many

769
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,634
people knowing about things, bad

770
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,719
things happen.

771
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,429
>> Who went through your bag,

772
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,388
though?

773
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,431
>> I don't know who, but they

774
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,348
did, because I just checked.

775
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:35,974
My pants are all ruffled up, and

776
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,642
I usually fold it nicely.

777
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,519
>> Finding out that Yau-Man had

778
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,896
the immunity idol changed a

779
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,605
whole bunch of stuff, because

780
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,024
everybody with an immunity idol

781
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,859
is considered dangerous.

782
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,860
Me, Cassandra, and Stacy know

783
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,069
that.

784
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,112
Everybody else is going to be on

785
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,363
a whole different level.

786
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,198
It's going to change a whole

787
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,283
bunch of stuff.

788
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:56,953
>> You know what?

789
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:57,746
At least it caused them some

790
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,872
dissension.

791
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,957
That's what we wanted.

792
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,920
You know what I mean?

793
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,338
>> The worst thing that can

794
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,131
happen is either Alex or Mookie

795
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:08,632
wins the next immunity

796
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,675
challenge, and somehow they

797
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,637
manage to get Dreamz and Boo to

798
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,555
their side.

799
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,641
Then it will be a 4-4 split.

800
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,018
And if we lose that 4-4 split,

801
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,728
it may be downhill for me.

802
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,695
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

803
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:40,872
We'll now bring in Boo returning

804
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,707
from Exile Island.

805
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,584
>> My tribe mates, my friends,

806
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:49,130
how y'all doing?

807
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:49,923
>> PROBST: First thing's first.

808
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,216
Yau-Man, I'll take back the

809
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,969
necklace.

810
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:58,223
Thank you.

811
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:58,848
Once again, immunity is back up

812
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,518
for grabs.

813
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,560
Today's challenge requires a

814
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,562
strong memory and a lot of

815
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,147
strategy.

816
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,191
You will each secretly select

817
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:08,817
your own block of three squares

818
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,528
on a grid.

819
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,028
They must line up either

820
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,532
horizontally, vertically, or

821
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,242
diagonally.

822
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,326
Then you're going to attempt to

823
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,911
knock out your opponents by

824
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,830
selecting coordinates and

825
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:27,085
bombing squares one by one.

826
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:27,836
The object of the game is to

827
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,547
knock out all of the squares of

828
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,882
your tribe mates.

829
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,467
The last person to still have a

830
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,469
square left on the grid wins

831
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,846
immunity, guaranteed a one-in-

832
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:43,184
seven shot at winning this game.

833
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,269
Losers go to tribal council

834
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,312
tonight.

835
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,397
Somebody will be going home.

836
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,482
Anything not clear?

837
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,400
We'll get your positions, and

838
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,819
we'll get started.

839
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,904
All right, Stacy has secretly

840
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,489
selected her block of three

841
00:26:56,573 --> 00:27:00,493
squares, as has Yau-Man, Mookie,

842
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:05,373
Cassandra, Dreamz, Boo, Alex,

843
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:10,170
and Earl.

844
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,129
Okay, so you all know your own

845
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:11,713
spots.

846
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,299
You don't know anybody else's.

847
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,216
So this is a little bit of a

848
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,094
guess and a lot of memory.

849
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,305
Dreamz, you're up first.

850
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,057
Fire away.

851
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,558
>> D-3.

852
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,643
>> PROBST: D-3 is a hit.

853
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,774
Oddly enough, Dreamz hits

854
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,611
himself, while also hitting Earl

855
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,696
and Boo.

856
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,661
Cassandra.

857
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,082
>> C-3.

858
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,709
>> PROBST: That is a hit.

859
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,504
That is a hit on Yau-Man and

860
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,005
Cassandra.

861
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:54,714
Cassandra blew up one of her own

862
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,717
positions on the target.

863
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,052
Mookie.

864
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,889
>> Uh... E-4.

865
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,643
>> PROBST: E-4 is a hit.

866
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,646
Earl takes his second hit.

867
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,440
Earl, make a selection.

868
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,858
>> B-4.

869
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,903
>> PROBST: B-4 is a good hit.

870
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,780
Earl hits Alex, Mookie, and

871
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,950
Cassandra, who now has only one

872
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:22,909
square left.

873
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,912
Yau-Man, make your choice.

874
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:30,291
>> C-2.

875
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,419
>> PROBST: That is a hit.

876
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,003
Dreamz and Boo both take their

877
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,880
second hit, and Earl takes his

878
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,134
third hit.

879
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,553
Earl is out of the game.

880
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,388
Stacy.

881
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,014
>> B-1.

882
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,893
>> PROBST: B-1 is a hit.

883
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,937
Boo takes a hit, and Dreamz

884
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,148
takes a hit.

885
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,607
And with that selection, Stacy,

886
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,984
you've knocked both Boo and

887
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:56,901
Dreamz out.

888
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,029
Take a spot on the mat, guys.

889
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,698
Alex.

890
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,199
>> D-2.

891
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,786
>> PROBST: D-2 is a miss.

892
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,289
Cassandra, your choice.

893
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,834
>> Can I have A-4, please?

894
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,295
>> PROBST: Miss.

895
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,546
Mookie.

896
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,590
>> A-5.

897
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,675
>> PROBST: A-5 is a hit.

898
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:22,135
Cassandra takes her third hit.

899
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:22,927
Cassandra, you're now out of the

900
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,889
challenge.

901
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:26,431
Yau-Man, chance to do some

902
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,934
damage.

903
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,061
>> C-5.

904
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,855
>> PROBST: Mookie takes a hit

905
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:38,234
and Stacy takes a hit.

906
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,404
Mookie now with one square left.

907
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,323
Alex.

908
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,824
>> B-5.

909
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,950
>> PROBST: miss.

910
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,994
Stacy.

911
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,579
>> A-4.

912
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,205
>> PROBST: A-4 has already been

913
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,831
picked.

914
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,625
It's a miss.

915
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,667
Memory is starting to play an

916
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,251
important role in this game as

917
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,003
we get further and further into

918
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,046
it.

919
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,300
Mookie, your choice.

920
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,968
>> C-4.

921
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,846
>> PROBST: That is a hit.

922
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,475
Alex takes a hit.

923
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,937
Alex now has one square left.

924
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,856
Yau-Man, your choice.

925
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,068
>> A-3.

926
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,029
>> PROBST: That is a hit.

927
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,907
Mookie takes his third hit.

928
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,409
Mookie now joins Earl, Dreamz,

929
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,828
Cassandra, and Boo.

930
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,163
We are down to three people

931
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,832
left: Alex, Yau-Man, Stacy.

932
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,042
Alex has one square left,

933
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,962
Yau-Man and Stacy each with two.

934
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,381
Alex, a chance to do some

935
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,551
damage.

936
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,927
>> E-5.

937
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,513
>> PROBST: E-5 is a hit.

938
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,056
It is a hit on Yau-Man.

939
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,308
Yau-Man and Alex each with one

940
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,186
square left.

941
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,272
Stacy.

942
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,402
>> D-4.

943
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,487
>> PROBST: Stacy says D-4.

944
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,745
D-4 is a hit.

945
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,330
Everybody takes a hit.

946
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,082
A good strategic move, as Stacy

947
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,083
hits herself but, in the

948
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,919
process, takes out both Yau-Man

949
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,380
and Alex.

950
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,466
Stacy wins individual immunity.

951
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,885
(<i> applause</i> )

952
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,515
Stacy, safe at tonight's tribal

953
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,766
council.

954
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,767
Somebody going home.

955
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,520
Head on out.

956
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,865
>> I'm not going to share with

957
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,951
them... if you can imagine.

958
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,285
But eat that.

959
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,745
That'll help keep your energy

960
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,287
up.

961
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,038
I'm definitely up against the

962
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:55,330
wall, right?

963
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:55,955
I don't have very many moves

964
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,916
left, but I'm just not... I'm

965
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,709
not going to go down without a

966
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,209
fight.

967
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,169
I'm don't think I'm going to go

968
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,086
that quietly, just so you know.

969
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,922
>> And right now, we have

970
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,799
nothing to be but honest.

971
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,592
>> We have nothing to be but

972
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,051
honest, exactly.

973
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,761
So I'm going to be completely

974
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,637
honest.

975
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,596
>> Cause some hell.

976
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,180
>> Just cause some hell, man.

977
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,056
If I'm going down, I'm bringing

978
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,893
hell with me.

979
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,852
I'm a lawyer.

980
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:18,811
I know what it's like to

981
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,562
negotiate with people.

982
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,396
I know what it's like to use

983
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,564
information strategically, which

984
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,857
I've been doing all along.

985
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,358
You know, it's very clear.

986
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,401
Hey, Yau-Man can't be trusted.

987
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,195
So at tonight's tribal council,

988
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,529
I'm going to point it out as

989
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,614
"Hey, these are the people

990
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,740
you've aligned yourself with.

991
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,241
Draw your own conclusions."

992
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,419
>> Why take a chance?

993
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,630
>> Okay, okay, fine, all right,

994
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,423
whatever, we'll do...

995
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,298
>> Everybody give it some

996
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,383
thought.

997
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,467
>> Boo came back from Exile

998
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,094
Island, and he had one clue to

999
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,597
the hidden immunity idol, and I

1000
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,181
think Boo somehow convinced

1001
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,267
Cassandra or whoever that Alex

1002
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,353
or Mookie may have found it

1003
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,021
somehow.

1004
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,273
They're afraid that Alex will

1005
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,899
pull another one out.

1006
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,984
So they're going to try and

1007
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,278
spread the vote out.

1008
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,502
>> Yeah, yeah.

1009
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,838
>> People want to do three votes

1010
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,090
Mookie and three votes Alex, and

1011
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,760
the reason for that was just you

1012
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,136
never know what might pop up.

1013
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,971
That will make it a tie at

1014
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,723
tribal council.

1015
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,557
So at that point, we can make a

1016
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,391
choice.

1017
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,434
We know that no magical idol has

1018
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,435
been played, because there won't

1019
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,519
be anything played, and we can

1020
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,520
say okay, "It's going to be

1021
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,688
Alex, that's who is going to

1022
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,314
go," because that is who's going

1023
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,691
to go.

1024
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,150
>> Ready?

1025
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,319
One, two, three.

1026
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,821
>> I'm against doing a split

1027
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,156
vote, but you know, I do what

1028
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,532
makes people feel comfortable.

1029
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,700
I'm not going to sit there and

1030
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,534
say, "No, guys, we're going to

1031
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,368
do this," because that would be

1032
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,454
the wrong approach.

1033
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,500
>> Tonight's tribal council,

1034
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,876
Mookie and I are going out

1035
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,337
swinging.

1036
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,797
And if that doesn't work, I

1037
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,215
think my best bet is to just try

1038
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,175
to stay alive past this vote.

1039
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,384
I've got one vote, and I better

1040
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,096
make it count.

1041
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,278
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1042
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:21,452
the jury: Rocky, Lisi, Michelle,

1043
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,995
and Edgardo, voted out at the

1044
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,082
last tribal council.

1045
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,963
Let's start with the reward

1046
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,297
challenge.

1047
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,882
Alex, did you sense the game

1048
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,299
shift at all?

1049
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,301
There were a lot of physical

1050
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,095
match-ups, a lot of people

1051
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,263
yelling at each other.

1052
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,848
>> I don't know if it changed

1053
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,683
the game, but it definitely

1054
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:44,809
revealed something about the way

1055
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,893
people are willing to play

1056
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,519
games, you know, if they're more

1057
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,771
likely to rub mud in someone's

1058
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,773
eyes or trip somebody.

1059
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,275
And as Dreamz pointed out last

1060
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,192
tribal council, the rats and the

1061
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,945
snakes came out of the woodwork.

1062
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:56,571
>> PROBST: Mookie, what did you

1063
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,322
notice from that challenge?

1064
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,867
>> I think, to some extent, we

1065
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,993
respect each other.

1066
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,869
But then, when it comes down to

1067
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:03,828
the game and how are you going

1068
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,288
to win, it's a little different.

1069
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,414
I mean, there's two sides to the

1070
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,582
story there.

1071
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,207
>> PROBST: Tell me about the

1072
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,375
other side.

1073
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,085
>> There are alliances, and one

1074
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:11,586
alliance was completely

1075
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,462
destroyed at the last tribal

1076
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,255
council, maybe some back

1077
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,381
stabbing and maybe some

1078
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,216
trickiness on the other

1079
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,718
alliance's part.

1080
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,886
But at that point, you feel

1081
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,596
yourself just being an outsider

1082
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,972
to an alliance.

1083
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:23,598
>> PROBST: So, Mookie, what do

1084
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,017
you do?

1085
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,601
>> You know, Alex and I, we

1086
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,351
realized our backs are against

1087
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,645
the wall with no way out.

1088
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,771
You know, we've come up with

1089
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,397
some kind of way we can possibly

1090
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,399
get out, and that was through an

1091
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:37,194
immunity idol that we found in

1092
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,405
one of the... in Yau-Man's bag.

1093
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,907
>> PROBST: Hold on, you found an

1094
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,366
immunity idol in Yau-Man's bag.

1095
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,619
>> Correct.

1096
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,579
>> PROBST: Found it?

1097
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,371
>> Well, it was in his bag,

1098
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,124
yeah.

1099
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,042
>> PROBST: This is coming on the

1100
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,126
heels of Alex saying the snakes

1101
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,669
and the rats came out.

1102
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,546
That's about as snaky-ratty as

1103
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,048
it gets, going through

1104
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,424
somebody's personal belongings.

1105
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,092
Yau-Man, is that fair-- that "If

1106
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:00,676
you're going something in your

1107
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,385
bag and leave, you better know I

1108
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,387
might look through it"?

1109
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,805
>> Well, the expectation is

1110
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,431
there's some privacy, but on the

1111
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,433
other hand, you know, it's a

1112
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,602
desperation move, and besides,

1113
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,394
it won't affect the outcome of

1114
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,521
the game for the next few

1115
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,522
rounds.

1116
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,148
>> PROBST: Well, that's a bold

1117
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:14,398
statement.

1118
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,483
It won't affect the game for the

1119
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,693
next few rounds?

1120
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,444
>> Couple rounds at least.

1121
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,696
I may have to change my strategy

1122
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,114
a little bit, if I, you know,

1123
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,324
intend to use it at some point.

1124
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,450
>> PROBST: Earl, what was the

1125
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,327
reaction when this all went

1126
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,495
down?

1127
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:27,828
>> I was pissed.

1128
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,454
Like, for one thing, I can say

1129
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,497
that this tribe, no one's going

1130
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,208
through anybody's stuff.

1131
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:32,833
That just hasn't been going on.

1132
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,501
So when I heard that, you know,

1133
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,545
I was pissed off.

1134
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,047
>> PROBST: Dreamz, how big an

1135
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,423
issue is trust?-- because it's

1136
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,800
hard to know who has been lying

1137
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,509
all along.

1138
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,804
>> My take on this is if they're

1139
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,180
both on the chopping block,

1140
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,932
after they're gone, it's still

1141
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:48,516
going to be six of us left.

1142
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,517
So we're going to split up too.

1143
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,519
So I'm trying to find out where

1144
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,145
I stand.

1145
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,939
>> PROBST: Alex, are there

1146
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:55,523
people coasting in this game

1147
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,608
that are threats and aren't seen

1148
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,901
as threats?

1149
00:37:58,985 --> 00:37:59,902
>> Yeah.

1150
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,070
And at this point, if Mookie and

1151
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,321
I are gone, and there are six

1152
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,656
people left, and they have to

1153
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,616
look at each other-- so whatever

1154
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,535
they did to get to that top six

1155
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,869
is going to come back and bite

1156
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,996
them in the ass.

1157
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,247
Karma has a funny way of working

1158
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,164
in this game, Jeff, and it's

1159
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:12,540
pretty immediate.

1160
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,583
You know, whatever will be will

1161
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,293
be, but word to the wise:

1162
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,962
remember past actions, because

1163
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,966
they foretell the future.

1164
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,426
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1165
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,552
to the vote.

1166
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,469
Based on tonight's tribal

1167
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,429
council, we know there is

1168
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,638
another hidden immunity idol in

1169
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,223
play.

1170
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,599
Whoever has it, if you need to

1171
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,559
use it tonight, you would

1172
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,643
present it to me before I read

1173
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,853
the votes.

1174
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:34,895
Stacy, you have individual

1175
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,521
immunity.

1176
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,189
Are you going hold on to it?

1177
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,107
>> Yeah.

1178
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,816
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1179
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,608
Stacy.

1180
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,484
Everybody else is fair game.

1181
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,528
Time to vote.

1182
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,322
Earl, you're up.

1183
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,174
>> Nothing personal.

1184
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,508
Someone needs to go.

1185
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:21,901
>> Just trying to stay in this

1186
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:22,902
another day, buddy.

1187
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,528
Good luck.

1188
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,286
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1189
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,580
votes.

1190
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:42,838
If you have the hidden immunity

1191
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,256
idol and you want to play it,

1192
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,549
now is the time to do so.

1193
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,350
Okay, once the votes are read,

1194
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:54,809
the decision is final.

1195
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,434
The person voted out will be

1196
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,353
asked to leave the tribal

1197
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,106
council area immediately.

1198
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:05,611
First vote: Alex.

1199
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,488
Alex.

1200
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,575
Two votes Alex.

1201
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:16,914
Mookie.

1202
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,541
Boo.

1203
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:22,628
One vote Boo.

1204
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,505
Mookie.

1205
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,840
That's two votes Mookie, two

1206
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:30,219
votes Alex, one vote Boo.

1207
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,846
Mookie.

1208
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:36,725
That's three votes Mookie.

1209
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,060
Alex.

1210
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,686
We're tied.

1211
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,521
Three votes Mookie, three votes

1212
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,150
Alex, one vote left.

1213
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,780
Eleventh person voted out and

1214
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,533
the fifth member of our jury,

1215
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,868
Mookie.

1216
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,495
You need to bring me your torch.

1217
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,923
Mookie, the tribe has spoken.

1218
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,258
Time for you to go.

1219
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,343
>> Good luck.

1220
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,063
>> PROBST: Well, based on what I

1221
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,607
heard tonight, it sounds like

1222
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,608
there's one very strong group of

1223
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,235
six and Alex, which means Alex

1224
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,695
is either odd man out or

1225
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,405
suddenly very valuable.

1226
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,865
Grab your torches.

1227
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,616
Head back to camp.

1228
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,076
Good night.

1229
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,005
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1230
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,090
from our next episode.

1231
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,387
>> PROBST: Next time on

1232
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,722
<i>Survivor,</i> Alex goes undercover.

1233
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,765
>> I'm trying to make sure I'm

1234
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,975
not seen or heard, kind of like

1235
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,435
a ninja right now.

1236
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,061
>> PROBST: Boo annoys everyone.

1237
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,437
>> He talks more than the girls

1238
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,230
talk.

1239
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:04,855
>> Y'all know what I was

1240
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,105
thinking.

1241
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,440
I was like, "Would you shut up?

1242
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:07,191
Why don't you stop saying stupid

1243
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:07,691
stuff?"

1244
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,609
>> PROBST: And the reward

1245
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,986
challenge gets primal.

1246
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,489
This is a free-for-all.

1247
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,287
>> You know, I'm pretty relieved

1248
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,538
that I'm out of the game, but at

1249
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,122
the same time, it would have

1250
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:22,665
been nice to still be in the

1251
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,749
game had the alliances stayed

1252
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,501
put for me.

1253
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,460
And I wish I could be back

1254
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:27,461
there, raising hell, making

1255
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:28,045
everyone's lives miserable, as

1256
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:28,712
miserable as my life has been

1257
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,464
here.

1258
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:31,090
It's kind of like grass is green

1259
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,424
on the other side.

1260
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,050
You know, it's unfortunate that

1261
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,593
I'm out of the game, but it was

1262
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,135
a great experience, and I

1263
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:35,678
wouldn't take it back for

1264
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,763
anything.
