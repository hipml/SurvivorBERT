1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,133
>> THINKING ABOUT IT MAKES YOU
SWEATY.

2
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,355
>> HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'S
FEELING?

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,275
>> YOU THINK YOU'RE GOOD, AND
THEN YOU GET BLINDSIDED.

4
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,276
LIKE I THINK HE'S STILL IN
SHOCK.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,279
>> TRIBAL WENT ACCORDING TO
PLAN.

6
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,405
TOM WENT HOME.

7
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:35,493
NOW WE'RE SITTING PRETTY WITH
FIVE VOKAI AND TWO LAIRO.

8
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,289
YOU THINK THIS IS SO SIMPLE,
LET'S TAKE OUT KARISHMA OR DEAN,

9
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,293
BUT THE PLAYERS I DON'T TRUST
ARE ACTUALLY JAMAL AND JACK.

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,294
THEY'RE THE GUYS THAT WERE
GUNNING FOR ME ON MY OWN TRIBE,

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,671
AND I KNOW I CAN'T WORK WITH
THOSE GUYS.

12
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,798
I HAVE TO KILL THEM BEFORE THEY
KILL ME.

13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,260
>> SO LIKE RIGHT NOW I SEE AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU AND ME TO

14
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,428
WORK TOGETHER.

15
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,429
>> OKAY.

16
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,265
>> JAMAL AND JACK, I WANT ONE OF
THOSE TWO GONE.

17
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,268
AND IF YOU HOOKED UP WITH THE
GIRLS AND WE GOT ONE OF THOSE

18
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:06,775
GUYS OUT, YOU WOULD GO FORWARD
AND WE WOULD BREAK THEM UP.

19
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,317
SO THINK ABOUT IT.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,611
>> OKAY.

21
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,697
>> NOURA HAS A PLAN.

22
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,283
THE PROBLEM IS NOR A IS
ABSOLUTELY CRAZY AND I THINK A

23
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,202
LITTLE BIT DELUSIONAL.

24
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,288
>> THIS MORNING, BY THE WAY,
THAT WATERED TASTED CHILL.

25
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,290
>> SHE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE, BUT
I WOULD BE CRAZY TO WORK WITH

26
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,167
HER, BUT I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
DISCOVERED A CRACK.

27
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:31,216
>> NOURA IS I STILL LOOK AT JACK
AND JAMAL AS TRYING TO RUN THE

28
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:31,716
SHOW.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,221
I THINK SHE'S CRAZY.

30
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,641
AND SHE'S LIKE --
>> SHE'S OUT OF HER MIND.

31
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,850
>> THAT'S LIKE, THINK ABOUT IT.

32
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,227
I THINK I GOT THE GIRLS, AND I
THINK IF YOU COME ON BOARD, WE

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,228
CAN DO IT.

34
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,023
>> OLD VOKAI ARE ON THE SAME
PAGE.

35
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,275
WE'RE TAKING OUT FORMER LAIRO
ONE ON ONE.

36
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:57,200
THEN NOURA DECIDES TO GO BONKERS
BY TRYING THE PULL TOGETHER A

37
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:03,206
GROUP TO COME AFTER ME.

38
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,208
>> TYING YOURSELF TO HER IS NOT
MOVE.

39
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,211
NOURA IS SO OUT OF TUNE AND SO
UNRELIABLE IN THIS GAME.

40
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,421
SHE DOESN'T GET IT.

41
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,050
THAT'S THE REASON WHY FOR ME
GETTING NOURA OUT IS OF THE

42
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:20,807
HIGHEST PRIORITY.

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,225
>> YOU WANT THIS LOGO WHERE IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE IN.

44
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,476
>> TURN IT AROUND.

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,354
THERE YOU GO.

46
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,272
>> IT'S LIKE GETTING DRESSED FOR
THE PROM.

47
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:32,318
>>
>> THERE YOU GO.

48
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:43,913
>> [SCREAMING]
>> A SPIDER.

49
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,747
>> IT WAS A TARANTULA?

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,333
>> I'M NEVER SLEEPING IN THIS
AGAIN.

51
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,295
>> I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT
IT, BUT IT WAS THIS BIG.

52
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,421
>> WAS IT A TRASH LA.

53
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,425
>> WE'RE ALL SMILING AND
LAUGHING AND JOKING AROUND, BUT

54
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,470
IF WE LOSE, STUFF IS ABOUT TO
GET REAL SERIOUS, BECAUSE WE'RE

55
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,763
4-4.

56
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,434
YOU KNOW, FOR VOKAI AND POOR OLD
LAIRO IS BASICALLY A STALEMATE.

57
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,144
>> HOW WILL WE GET THE NUMBERS?

58
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,562
>> I DON'T THINK THEY'LL TURN.

59
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,773
>> THEY'RE ALSO WILLING TO GO TO
ROCKS, WHICH MEANS WE WOULD HAVE

60
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,441
TO GO TO ROCKS.

61
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,401
>> ARE WE WILLING TO DO THAT?

62
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,279
>> US PEOPLE NEED TO STICK
TOGETHER.

63
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:22,744
WE BASICALLY WILL HAVE TO DRAW
ROCKS AND NO HARD FEELINGS.

64
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,787
AARON, MISSY, ELIZABETH, THEY
ARE LOYAL.

65
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,417
IF WE LOSE AND GO THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL, I DON'T THINK THEY'LL

66
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,126
SLIP.

67
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,962
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO TO ROCKS.

68
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,297
HE'S NOT GOING TO GO TO ROCKS.

69
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,466
>> I'M NOT GOING TO PUT MY FATE
IN THE GAME THE CHANCE, NOT A

70
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,675
CHANCE.

71
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,637
I'LL PLEDGE MY LOYALTY TO YOU
AND TELL YOU, IF YOU WANT ONE OF

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,640
MY GIRLS OUT, THEN IT'S TIME TO
CUT ONE OF THEM.

73
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:48,436
I WOULD PREFER NOT MISSY OR
ELIZABETH, THEY'RE LOYAL TO ME.

74
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,646
THAT MEANS THEY'RE LOYAL TO YOU.

75
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,816
>> SHE DOESN'T REALIZE YOU WOULD
BE WILLING THE WRITE HER NAME

76
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,192
DOWN?

77
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:54,901
>> NO, AT ALL.

78
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,321
>> THEY FLIP AT THE DROP OF HAT.

79
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,823
THEY'RE SCRAMBLING AND FIGHTING
FOR THEMSELVES.

80
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,493
AARON SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING
TO VOTE ELAINE.

81
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,202
SOUNDS GREAT.

82
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,662
IT'S ALL GOOD IN THE HOOD HERE.

83
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:13,962
IT REALLY IS.

84
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:24,013
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

85
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,557
VOKAI GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
THE NEW LAIRO TRIBE.

86
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:34,440
TOM VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

87
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,274
ALL RIGHT.

88
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,401
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S REWARD
CHALLENGE.

89
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,363
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'LL
TRANSPORT A SLED LOADED WITH

90
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,574
SANDBAGS AND ONE TRIBE MEMBER ON
TOP DOWN A TRAP AND THROUGH A

91
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,203
SERIES OF OBSTACLES.

92
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,080
YOU'LL RETRIEVE A KEY.

93
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,708
USE THE KEY TO UNLOCK A
SLINGSHOT.

94
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:58,423
USE THE SLINGSHOT TO KNOCK DOWN
THREE TARGETS.

95
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,676
ONE MORE THING, THE PERSON YOU
CARRY ON TOP OF THE SLED MUST

96
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,347
ALSO BE THE PERSON WHO SHOOTS AT
THE TARGET.

97
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,223
BILLING CHOICE.

98
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,891
YOU'RE PUTTING ONE PERSON IN A
BIG ROLE.

99
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,560
FIRST TO FINISH WINS REWARD.

100
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,436
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

101
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,730
>> YES.

102
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,066
>> Jeff: IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
THEM ALREADY...

103
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,068
>> MIGHT BE A CHICKEN.

104
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,905
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: CHICKENS.

105
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,782
>> I WANT TO EAT THAT.

106
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,869
>> Jeff: VOKAI, YOU HAVE ONE
EXTRA PERSON, SITTING SOMEBODY

107
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,078
OUT.

108
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,330
WHOEVER YOU SIT OUT MUST COMPETE
THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

109
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,750
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE IN
>> ELAINE IS GOING TO SIT OUT.

110
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:38,087
>> Jeff: ELAINE, YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO TAKE A SPOT ON THE

111
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:38,921
SITOUT BENCH.

112
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,799
YOU ARE HEADED TO ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS.

113
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,967
BOAT IS WAITING FOR YOU.

114
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,218
HEAD OUT.

115
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,930
>> OH.

116
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,432
>> WIN ME A CHICKEN, PLEASE.

117
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,809
>> WE'LL SAVE YOU ONE.

118
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,728
>> DANG, THAT SUCKS.

119
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,771
>> Jeff: DANG, THAT SUCKS?

120
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,564
>> I WANTED TO PLAY, JEFF.

121
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,109
>> Jeff: YOU WERE ALREADY
SITTING OUT.

122
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,613
>> I KNOW, BUT AT LEAST WATCH
IT.

123
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,407
>> Jeff: GIVE YOU GUYS A
MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

124
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:11,287
YOU'LL GET STARTED.

125
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,163
ALL RIGHT.

126
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:17,418
HOAR WE GO, FOR REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY.

127
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,295
GO!

128
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,463
>> TELL US WHEN TO GO?

129
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,173
>> ONE, TWO, THREE...

130
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,343
>> Jeff: WHOEVER YOU PUT ON
THAT SLED IS GOING TO BE YOUR

131
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,552
TARGET SHOOTER.

132
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,678
IT'S GOING TO BE JACK AND AARON
IN THE SHOWDOWN AT THE END.

133
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,681
BUT FIRST YOU GOT TO GET THERE.

134
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,643
LIFT YOUR TRIBE MEMBER UP TO GET
TO THAT KEY.

135
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,978
AARON IS THERE FIRST.

136
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,146
JACK RIGHT BEHIND.

137
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,022
EVERY SECOND COUNTS.

138
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,525
YOU ONLY HAVE THREE TARGETS TO
KNOCK DOWN.

139
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,151
>> GO!

140
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,320
>> Jeff: VOKAI HAS IT.

141
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,197
>> SANDBAGS, GO, GO, GO,.

142
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,657
>> Jeff: LAIRO IS RIGHT
BEHIND.

143
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,700
VOKAI IN THE LEAD.

144
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,160
START UNLOADING THOSE BAGS.

145
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:51,828
LET'S GO, LAIRO.

146
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,998
START UNLOADING THOSE BAGS.

147
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,084
JACK CANNOT HELP, AARON CANNOT
HELP.

148
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,340
YOU GOT TO GET THOSE BAGS.

149
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,342
>> WATCH WHERE YOU'RE THROWING
THEM.

150
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,635
>> Jeff: HOWEVER YOU CAN TO
YOUR PLATFORM.

151
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,347
AND THAT ARE HEAVY.

152
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,308
VOKAI HAS A GOOD SYSTEM OF
TRANSPORTING THEM.

153
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,810
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

154
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,686
KEEP IT GOING.

155
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,188
>> Jeff: LAIRO CARRYING THEM
INDIVIDUALLY.

156
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,691
WHICH SYSTEM WILL WORK BET
CENTER RIGHT NOW IT'S VOKAI WITH

157
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,026
A BIT OF A LEAD STILL.

158
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,862
LAIRO RIGHT BEHIND.

159
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,864
VOKAI WITH THEIR LAST BAG.

160
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,032
YOU'RE GOOD!

161
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,159
GET BACK IN THE SLED.

162
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,535
LAIRO WITH THEIR LAST BAG.

163
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,871
BOTH TRIBES FINISH AT ALMOST THE
SAME TIME.

164
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,330
>> READY?

165
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,290
LIFT!

166
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,667
>> Jeff: YOU HAVE TO GET TO
THAT FINAL CRADLE.

167
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,668
LAIRO IS MOVING QUICKLY.

168
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,752
THEY HAVE CAUGHT UP.

169
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,170
AARON IS THERE.

170
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,504
JACK IS THERE.

171
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,047
HERE IT COME, THE SHOWDOWN.

172
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,048
>> ALL RIGHT, JACK.

173
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,551
>> Jeff: AARON TRYING TO
UNLOCK HIS SLINGSHOT.

174
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,344
JACK GETTING HIS FREE.

175
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:50,928
AARON'S GOOD.

176
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,721
JACK IS GOOD.

177
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,390
WE ARE STILL SIDE BY SIDE.

178
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,892
>> THIS IS IS ALL YOU, BABY.

179
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,101
>> Jeff: THREE TARGETS.

180
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,227
HERE WE GO.

181
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,062
FOR REWARD, AARON JUST MISSES.

182
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,731
>> YOU GOT IT, JACK.

183
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,523
YOU GOT THIS.

184
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,568
>> Jeff: JACK WITH HIS FIRST
TOSS.

185
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,570
AND HE'S GOT ONE OUT OF THE
GATE.

186
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,779
LAIRO IN THE LEAD.

187
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,698
THEY'RE NOT USED TO THIS.

188
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,367
ERIC WITH SHOT.

189
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,077
>> THINK CHICKEN, BABY.

190
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,747
>> Jeff: AARON TIES IT UP.

191
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,208
BOTH TRIBES HAVE TWO TARGETS
LEFT.

192
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:20,917
>> YOU GOT, THIS BUDDY.

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,668
>> Jeff: JACK WITH ANOTHER
SHOT.

194
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,629
>> HERE WE GO.

195
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,255
>> Jeff: JUST MISSES.

196
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,798
AARON REARS BACK.

197
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,968
NUMBER TWO FOR VOKAI.

198
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,470
IT'S VOKAI IN THE LEAD.

199
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,555
ONE TARGET AWAY FROM WINNING
REWARD.

200
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,473
>> JACK, YOU GOT THIS.

201
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:39,602
>> Jeff: JACK TRYING TO TIE IT
UP RIGHT HERE.

202
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,562
JUST MISSES TO THE LEFT.

203
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,605
>> COME ON!

204
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,898
COME ON!

205
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:51,447
>> Jeff: AARON ALL THE WAY
BACK FOR THE WIN.

206
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,450
AND HE DOES IT!

207
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,244
VOKAI WINS.

208
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:03,334
CHICKENS WAITING FOR VOKAI
BECOME AT CAMP.

209
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:09,423
LAIRO, SAME STORY, GOT NOTHING
FOR YOU.

210
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,134
>> WE'RE WINNING EVERY CHALLENGE
WE GO TO.

211
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,763
NEW VOKAI TRIBE IS ALL THIS ALL
DAY, BUT WITH ISLAND OF THE

212
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,432
IDOLS, I THINK YOU HAVE TO
ASSUME THE WORST, AND IF ELAINE

213
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,936
COMES BACK WITH AN IDOL, THAT
TREMENDOUSLY COMPLICATES THE

214
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,688
NEXT IMMUNITY VOTE IF WE GET TO
IT.

215
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,400
IT MAKES IT VERY SCARY.

216
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,873
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA TIME
HERE ON ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

217
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,335
NOBODY IS VOTING US OFF, SO I'M
BUILDING A SHELTER LIKE YOU'VE

218
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,504
NEVER SEEN BEFORE ON "SURVIVOR."

219
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:54,135
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE THE MANSION
OF ALL SHELTERS.

220
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:54,677
WE'RE GETTING THERE.

221
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,512
A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME.

222
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,182
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET, BUT I MAY
CORNER OFF ONE SIDE OF THE

223
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:05,062
SHELTER JUST FOR SANDRA, BECAUSE
SHE SNORES AT NIGHT.

224
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:11,193
[LAUGHING]
>> I UNDERSTOOD MY TRIBE'S

225
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,695
REASONING FOR WANT TO SET ME
OUT.

226
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,408
I'M 5'2", A LITTLE BUSTED CAN OF
BISCUIT, BUT THAT'S THE STORY OF

227
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,701
MY LIFE.

228
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,370
EVERYONE UNDERESTIMATES ME
BECAUSE OF MY SIZE.

229
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,290
BUT I HAVE THE HEART OF A LION
AND I'M STRONG LIKE AN OX.

230
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,542
THEY UNDERESTIMATE THAT BIG
TIME.

231
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,835
I'M OKAY BEING BY MYSELF AND
ROLLING SOLO.

232
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:32,882
I'M HOPING GETTING SENT TO THE
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS IS A GAME

233
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,091
CHANGER.

234
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,926
>>WOW.

235
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,886
WHAT IN THE WORLD
SHUT YOUR FACE.

236
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,096
HOLY CRAP.

237
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,265
>> WELCOME.

238
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,058
COME ON.

239
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,059
GIVE ME A HUG.

240
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:43,768
HOW ARE YOU?

241
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,560
>> YOU'RE MY HERO.

242
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,855
>> THIS IS THE ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS.

243
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:48,189
>> WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

244
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,899
>> ELAINE.

245
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,777
>> ELAINE, I'M ROB
>> I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

246
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,028
>> I LOVE THE HAT.

247
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,945
>> COME IN.

248
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,867
WE'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

249
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,077
>> HOW'S IT GOING?

250
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,745
>> IT'S GOING, DUDE.

251
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,747
I CAN'T BELIEVE Y'ALL ARE HERE.

252
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,414
IT'S CRAZY.

253
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,625
>> WE SHOULD GET DOWN TO BIDS.

254
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,751
>> OKAY.

255
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,086
>> EVERYBODY THAT COMES TO THE
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS GETS A

256
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,253
LESSON.

257
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,755
TODAY YOUR LESSON IS ABOUT
HAVING THE COURAGE TO BE DARING.

258
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,884
IT ACTUALLY STARTS RIGHT NOW.

259
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,010
>> WHAT?

260
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,430
>> IN "SURVIVOR," YOU OF THE
HAVEN'T TO MAKE SPLIT-SECOND

261
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:21,764
DECISIONS.

262
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,973
>> RIGHT.

263
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,434
>> YOU HAVE TO DO IT WITHOUT
HESITATING AND SOMETIMES WITHOUT

264
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:25,768
INFORMATION.

265
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,435
>> UH-HUH.

266
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,312
>> THAT'S THE SITUATION TODAY.

267
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,940
YOU HAVE UNTIL THE SAND RUNS OUT
OF THAT BOTTLE TO DECIDE WHETHER

268
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,443
OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT
YOUR TEST.

269
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,363
IF THE SAND RUNS OUT OF THAT
BOTTLE BEFORE YOU GIVE ME A --

270
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,030
>> LET'S DO IT.

271
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:38,948
I'M READY.

272
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,866
>> YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT.

273
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,951
>> LET'S DO IT.

274
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,662
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING FOR.

275
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,955
>> I DON'T CARE.

276
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:46,455
LET'S DO IT.

277
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,289
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

278
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,126
LET'S GO
>> IMMEDIATELY ELAINE JUMPS ALL

279
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:50,918
OVER ME.

280
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:51,377
I'LL TAKE IT.

281
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,754
I'LL TAKE IT, ROB.

282
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,966
ELAINE, I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU WHAT
IT IS, ROB.

283
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,050
I DON'T CARE.

284
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,009
I'LL TAKE IT.

285
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,721
BEING THAT IMPULSIVE IS A
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

286
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,140
SHE'S SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY,
BUT SOMETIMES MAYBE STICK YOUR

287
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,015
FEET IN THE WATER BEFORE YOU
JUMP IN.

288
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,061
>>YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
SAID YES.

289
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,604
TO YOU DIDN'T LET ME GET IT TO.

290
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,147
>> STORY OF MY LIFE.

291
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,107
THIS IS WHAT I COME FOR.

292
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,317
I COME FOR THE EXPERIENCE,
ADVENTURE

293
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,569
>> I LIKE IT.

294
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,822
>> I'M IN THE HERE JUST FOR $1
MILLION, EVEN THOUGH THE MILLION

295
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,823
WOULD BE SWEET.

296
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,032
I'M HERE FOR MORE THAN THAT.

297
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,828
I JUST LOST MY MOM THREE MONTHS
BEFORE I COME OUT HERE, SO I

298
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,955
WANT TO SOUL SEARCH.

299
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,498
I WANT THAT LIFETIME JOURNEY.

300
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,500
I WANT SOME OF THAT
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

301
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,168
>> NERVOUS.

302
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,670
>> IT'S NOT TIME TO BE NERVOUS.

303
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,549
YOU BETTER START SERVING
>> I LOVE ELAINE.

304
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,425
SHE'S BALLS TO THE WALL.

305
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,634
THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY "SURVIVOR."

306
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,177
BUT THE EASY PART IS OVER.

307
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,386
NOW IS THE HARD PART.

308
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,849
>> AT THIS POINT WE CAN FILL YOU
IN ON WHAT YOU JUST AGREED TO

309
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,309
AND TELL YOU YOUR TEST.

310
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:54,690
AT YOUR NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,
A BLOCK OF ADVANTAGE WILL BE

311
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,858
HIDDEN.

312
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,861
YOU MUST BE GRAB IT WHILE
SURROUNDED BY YOUR TRIBE MATES.

313
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,029
BOTH TEAMS WILL START ON A MTA.

314
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,324
THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO
IS DIG IN THE SAND TO GET INTO

315
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,575
THE CAGE.

316
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,329
THEN TRIBE MEMBERS HAVE TO MOVE
THE CAGE OVER A TABLE AND SET IT

317
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,497
DOWN.

318
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,917
UNDERNEATH THE TABLE, THAT'S
WHERE YOUR ADVANTAGE WILL BE.

319
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,544
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, IT'S NOT
GOING TO BE EASY.

320
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:21,217
YOU HAVE TO GRAB THIS ADVANTAGE
IN PLAIN SIGHT OF ALL YOUR TRIBE

321
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,719
MATES IN THE MIDDLE OF A
CHALLENGE, AN YOU ONLY GET ONE

322
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,803
SHOT TO DO IT.

323
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,722
IF YOU MISS YOUR OPPORTUNITY,
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

324
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,223
YOU GOT IT?

325
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,015
>> I CAN DO THIS.

326
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,850
I'M LIKE A NINJA.

327
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,518
I CAN DO IT.

328
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,853
>> HERE'S THE THING, ELAINE.

329
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,104
IF YOU FAIL THE GRAB THE
ADVANTAGE, THERE IS A

330
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,147
CONSEQUENCE.

331
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:40,736
YOU WILL LOSE YOUR VOTE AT THE
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

332
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,780
>> OH.

333
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,280
4-4.

334
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,573
THAT'S A ROUGH ONE.

335
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,199
DAMN.

336
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,408
THAT SUCKS.

337
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,078
IF WE GO THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AND
IT'S 4-4 AND I LOSE MY VOTE,

338
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,080
THEN WE'RE SITTING DUCKS.

339
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:58,546
SO, YEAH, BIG STAKES, BUT I LIKE
STAKES.

340
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,547
YUM, YUM, YUM.

341
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,423
>> THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

342
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,425
>> ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME A
CHICKEN?

343
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,262
>> WE WANT YOU TO CHOOSE THE
NEXT PERSON FROM THE OPPOSITE

344
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,096
TRIBE TO COME VISIT US HERE.

345
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,766
>> ELAINE, SHE WON ME OVER.

346
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,809
SHE HAS THE GUSTO.

347
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,561
SHE HAS THE COMPLETE PACKAGE.

348
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,395
AND SHE'S DARING.

349
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,479
>> ALL RIGHT, ROB.

350
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,274
>> REMEMBER, CHOOSE YOUR
OPPORTUNITY OKAY.

351
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:18,899
GO FOR IT.

352
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,278
>> YOU GOT THIS.

353
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,739
SHE CAME TO PLAY, AND IF HER
TRIBE MATES DON'T WATCH OUT,

354
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,492
SHE'LL BE RIGHT THERE AT THE
END, AND SHE COULD EASILY TAKE

355
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:37,251
THIS MONEY.

356
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:44,008
>> THAT RHYTHM IS WANCALUCA.

357
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:51,015
>> I DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT WEST
AFRICA.

358
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,266
BUT JAMAL IS TEN YEARS OLDER
THAN I AM.

359
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,143
HE HAS SO MUCH MORE EXPERIENCE
AND WIZ COME THAN I DO, SO IT'S

360
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:59,773
FUN JUST SEEING JAMAL MAKE HIS
OWN DRUM AND TEACH KELLEE A WEST

361
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,608
AFRICAN DANCE.

362
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,943
>> JAMAL, TEACH ME HOW TO DO THE
DANCE.

363
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:07,990
>> JUMP BACK.

364
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:13,370
>> IT'S KIND OF COOL TO SEE HIM
OPENING UP AND SHARING MORE.

365
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,079
I LOVE IT.

366
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:19,126
IT IS GREAT.

367
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,220
>> NOW DO THAT.

368
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,143
>> I WAS SELF-CONSCIOUS.

369
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:40,105
WHITE PEOPLE, I'M ALWAYS LIKE,
DO YOU WELCOME THE RACE

370
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:40,481
CONVERSATION?

371
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,482
>> CAREFUL.

372
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,902
>> JACK WALKS AWAY.

373
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,070
>> DO-RAG.

374
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:51,408
JACK IS WALKING BY, AND HE'S
LIKE, JAMAL, CAN YOU USE YOUR

375
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,743
DO-RAG TO LIFT THE POT.

376
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,329
I IMMEDIATELY STAND UP AND HIM
AND LOOK AT HIM.

377
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,163
>> I MAKE A JOKE.

378
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,206
THAT SUCKED.

379
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,875
I IMMEDIATELY KNEW THAT I HAD
SAID SOMETHING WRONG.

380
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,210
AND I WAS VERY EMBARRASSED TO
HAVE SAID IT.

381
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,214
I JUST WAS LIKE THINKING ABOUT
IT MAKES ME SWEATY.

382
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:10,386
I JUST FELT REALLY BAD, BECAUSE
I FELT LIKE I COMPROMISED -- I

383
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,180
FELT LIKE JAMAL SEES ME IN THIS
MATURE WAY, AND I FEEL LIKE I

384
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,725
TOOK A STEP BACKWARD
>> I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M

385
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,310
EMBARRASSED I DID THAT TO YOU.

386
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,313
>> HOPEFULLY WE CAN MOVE FORWARD
FROM HERE.

387
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,774
IT WILL TAKE ME A LITTLE BIT OF
TIME.

388
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,527
I HOPE YOU CAN RESPECT THAT
>> ABSOLUTELY.

389
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,487
>> OKAY.

390
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,074
>> IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED
ABOUT WHY THIS IS INSULTING.

391
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,452
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE
MIGHT THINK WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

392
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:39,248
DON'T BLACK MEN WEAR DURAGS?

393
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,252
THE PROBLEM IS THE IMAGE A LOT
OF WHITE AMERICA HAS ABOUT BLACK

394
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,256
MEMBER IS THE THUG, THE DEADBEAT
FATHER, RIGHT, THE LEECH ON

395
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:53,595
SOCIAL SERVICES, WHICH IS OFTEN
UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE WEARING

396
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,431
DURAGS, TATTOO, WIFE BEATERS,
RIGHT?

397
00:16:55,514 --> 00:17:02,146
SO THIS WHOLE CARICATURE IS SO
ENGRAINED IN OUR CULTURE AND SO

398
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,065
COMFORTABLE FOR MAINSTREAM WHITE
AMERICA TO DIGEST ABOUT THE

399
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:14,658
BLACK MALE BODY THAT FOR A
SWEET, WELL-INTENTIONED BOY LIKE

400
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,368
JACK, IT FLOWS OFF THE TONGUE.

401
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,998
YOU HAVE PILLARS OF IDENTITY,
RACE, GENDER, SEXUAL

402
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,793
ORIENTATION, SOCIOECONOMIC
STATUS, YOU HAVE RELIGION.

403
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,837
INTERESTING TO RECOGNIZE THAT
YOU SEE IT THAT WAY.

404
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,005
>> VERY.

405
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,300
>> WHITE STRAIGHT MEN HAVE A
REALLY LONG WAY TO GO WHEN IT

406
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,386
COMES TO SELF-AWARENESS ABOUT
THEIR PRIVILEGE IN THIS WORLD.

407
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,476
>> I THINK THAT IS WHY I FEEL SO
POORLY ABOUT WHAT I DID BUT ALSO

408
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:49,651
WHAT I'M TAKING IS THAT ME BEING
MORE AWARE, BECAUSE I -- THERE'S

409
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,155
A LOT OF PLACES WHERE I CAN BE
MORE OF AN ACTIVE PERSON.

410
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,992
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

411
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,536
NOW, TO REACH A LITTLE FURTHER,
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN

412
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,290
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE ON THE BOTTOM?

413
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,335
>> ON THE BOTTOM?

414
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:11,632
>> JAMAL HAS A WAY OF HELPING ME
UNDERSTAND THAT PRIVILEGES DO

415
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,758
EXIST.

416
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,218
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK OF
MYSELF AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED

417
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:19,139
PERSON, BUT THE FACT OF THE
MATTER IS I AM VERY PRIVILEGED.

418
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,307
I AM.

419
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,392
AND IT'S REALLY COOL TO SHARE A
VERY HUMAN MOMENT WITH MY

420
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:27,064
STRONGEST ALLY, BECAUSE IT
BROUGHT US TOGETHER MORE AS

421
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,193
FRIENDS, EVEN THOUGH I MADE VERY
STUPID COMMENT.

422
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,194
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO
APOLOGIZE.

423
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,863
>> WELL, THANK YOU FOR DOING SO.

424
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,158
IT MEANS A LOT, AND IT'S HELPFUL
FOR ME TO TALK THAT WAY OUT

425
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:42,204
HERE, BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO KNOW
WHEN IT'S SAFE TO COME ON STRONG

426
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,039
WITH THAT KIND OF THING.

427
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,374
>> NO, I MEAN, I WANT YOU TO.

428
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,250
>> YEAH.

429
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,419
>> ESPECIALLY WITH ME, FEEL
COMFORTABLE.

430
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:53,215
>> BECAUSE IT CAN BE DIVISIVE
AND WE'RE PLAYING A SOCIAL GAME.

431
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,218
>> I GOT TO TELL YOU, I DON'T
GET A LOT OF APOLOGIES LIKE

432
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,386
THAT.

433
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,223
I DON'T GET A LOT OF PEOPLE
RECOGNIZING JUST HOW HARMFUL

434
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,392
THOSE LITTLE MOMENTS ADD UP TO
BE.

435
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:08,689
AND SO JACK'S APOLOGY TO ME KIND
OF LIKE MADE UP FOR A LOT OF

436
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,609
TIMES WHEN I'VE HAD TO FEEL SO
INSIGNIFICANT AND LET IT ROLL

437
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,237
OFF MY SHOULDERS FOR MY OWN
SOCIAL MOBILITY.

438
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,282
SO THAT APOLOGY, MAN, I'LL
REMEMBER THAT FOR THE REST OF MY

439
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,368
LIFE.

440
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,256
>> WHICH ONE IS THE ROOSTER?

441
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,424
>> I DON'T KNOW.

442
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,844
>> WE ARE SOME DUMB CITY FOLK, I
HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

443
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,472
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING
MALE ABOUT THIS ONE.

444
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,350
HEY, FELLA.

445
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,233
>> I'M HAPPY I CAN SHARE IT WITH
SOMEBODY NOW.

446
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:53,650
IS IT GOOD OR BAD?

447
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,235
CAN YOU TELL ME?

448
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,445
>> IT'S GOOD FOR US.

449
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,530
>> IF I CAN GET IT.

450
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,746
>> I MET ROB AND SANDRA.

451
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,413
>> SHUT UP.

452
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,250
>> WE WOULD KEEP THE MAJORITY.

453
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,460
>> I'LL COVER FOR YOU.

454
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,630
>> THERE IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR YOU
AT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IF I

455
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,839
CAN GET IT.

456
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,634
BUT I'M NERVOUS, SO I SPILLED
THE BEANS TO ELIZABETH, BECAUSE

457
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,470
SHE'S BEEN TO THE ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS.

458
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,264
SHE CAN RELATE TO MY
PREDICAMENT.

459
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,975
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS,
BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE

460
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:27,809
RIGHT THERE AT THAT ONE TABLE.

461
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,603
EVERYBODY'S EYES WILL BE RIGHT
THERE.

462
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:36,026
>> THIS IS HUGE, ELAINE.

463
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:36,985
>> NO PRESSURE.

464
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,779
>> RIGHT?

465
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,613
TOTALLY FINE.

466
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:49,623
JUST ANOTHER DAY IN THE OFFICE,
RIGHT?

467
00:20:49,706 --> 00:21:00,133
JUST ANOTHER DAY IN THE OFFICE,
RIGHT?

468
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:11,186
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

469
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,020
ALL RIGHT.

470
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,855
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

471
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,317
FIRST THINGS FIRST, DAN, WE'LL

00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:23,198
THANK YOU.

BAMBOO CAGE.

PICK IT UP AND MAKE YOU WAY

477
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:37,337

PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

VOKAI, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
PERSON.

484
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,897
ELAINE SAT OUT THE LAST
CHALLENGE.

485
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,399
WHO IS GOING TO SIT OUT THIS

SURVIVORS READY IN GO!

496
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,585
>> LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

497
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,589
>> Jeff: FIRST THING YOU HAVE
TO DO IS DIG AS A TRIBE UNDER

498
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,924
THAT CAGE AND GET INSIDE IT.

499
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,885
>> THAT'S THE WAY TO WORK,
ELIZABETH.

500
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:25,427
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH IS UNDER
FIRST FOR VOKAI.

501
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,388
THERE GOES JASON.

KELLEE IS IN.

SHE CAN START DIGGING FROM THE
INSIDE.

507
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:39,900
VOKAI HAS BIG HOLE.

THEY'RE OUT OF THE GATE FIRST.

513
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,996

593
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,251
N?

00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:33,300
NOT COME FROM THE LAIRO TRIBE.

609
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,136
IT WON'T BE ANYBODY FROM LAIRO
GOING HOME.

610
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:36,845
CONGRATULATIONS.

SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

620
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:58,950
>> WE ENDED UP LOSING THE
CHALLENGE, BUT THIS BLOCK OF

621
00:26:59,034 --> 00:26:59,826
VOTES IS HUGE.

622
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,203
IT COULDN'T HAVE CAME AT A
BETTER TIME.

623
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,206
I'M GOING TO PLAY THE HERO AND
RIDE IN ON MY STALLION AND JUMP

624
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,334

WE DO HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

628
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,069
WE'RE HAVING CHICKEN DINNER.

629
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,072
RIGHT NOW ELAINE IS LIKE ONE OF
THOSE CHICKENS IN THE CAGE

630
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,074
WAITING TO BE SLAUGHTERED.

631
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,076
IT'S STILL GOING TO TASTE GOOD.

632
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,080
UNLESS ELAINE HAS AN IDOL, SHE'S
GOING HOME.

633
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:49,584
TONIGHT I'M HOPING WE GET A BIG

YOU HAVE EARNED THE BLOCK-A-VOTE
ADVANTAGE.

636
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,010
IF THEY GET SPOOKED, THEY MIGHT
VOTE WITH THEM.

637
00:27:59,094 --> 00:27:59,928
>> YEAH.

638
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:04,557

640
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,603
>> OKAY.

641
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,897
>> THE BLOCK THE VOTE CHANGES
EVERYTHING.

642
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,319
THIS IS A GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR
THE FOUR LAIRO HERE AT VOKAI 2.0

643
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,822
TO SURVIVE, BUT WE NEED TO HAVE
FOUR NUMBERS TO THEIR THREE.

644
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,951
SO AS LONG AS ELAINE AND I CAN
CONVINCE MISSY AND AARON TO VOTE

645
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,161
WITH US, WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

>> YOU GOT TO BLOCK THE VOTE.

651
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:38,842
>> YOU CAN BLOCK ONE OF THEIR
VOTES.

652
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,135
>> YOU'RE US WITH, RIGHT?

653
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:40,885

>> I'M IN.

656
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,638
I'M IN.

657
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,473
>> WHO WOULD HAVE THUNK IT.

658
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,519
LITTLE OLD K.Y. WOULD COME
THROUGH FOR THE TEAM.

659
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,728
THAT'S AWESOME.

660
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,940
THAT'S THE COOLEST PART, LIKE I
GET TO DO THIS FOR MY PEEPS.

661
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,108
>> I LOVE YOU.

662
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,484
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

663
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,779
>> I GOT A BLOCK THE VOTE.

664
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,363
>> OKAY.

665
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:00,989
>> I GOT A BLOCK THE VOTE.

666
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,866
I GOT IT AT THE CHALLENGE.

667
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,158
>> OKAY.

668
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,159
OKAY.

669
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,869
>> SO WE'RE GOING THE BLOCK ONE

671
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,707
>> THANKS, ELAINE.

672
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,041
>> NOW WE RUN THE GAME.

673
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:12,459
OKAY.

674
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,585
THIS IS CRAZY.

675
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,463
WE WERE BASICALLY OFFERING UP
ELAINE AS A SACRIFICE, BUT

676
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:20,049
BECAUSE SHE CAN SAVE US, NOW
SHE'S OUR HERO.

677
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,551
>> NOW WE CONTROL THE GAME.

678
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:22,719
>> GOOD TO GO.

679
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:27,557
>> WHAT I'M DOING IS 100% A
COVER TO KEEP ELAINE RELAXED.

680
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,266
HEY, WE'RE OKAY.

681
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,018
WE'RE OKAY.

682
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,397
WELL, YOU'RE NOT OKAY.

683
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,857
>> HOW'S IT GOING?

684
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,025
>> YOU FEEL GOOD?

685
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,821
>> I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE
FOR MY GAME TO ROLL WITH YOU

686
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,530
GUYS.

687
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,823
>> ELAINE HAS THE BLOCK A VOTE.

688
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,160
BUT IF I HOP IN WITH VOKAI, WE
COULD STILL TAKE ELAINE OUT OF

689
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,369
THIS GAME.

690
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,913
IF I PROVE MY LOYALTY AT THIS
POINT IN TIME AND I VOTE THE WAY

691
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,041
VOKAI WANTS ME TO VOTE, ELAINE
GOES HOME.

692
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,667
I GET CEMENTED WITH THESE GUYS.

693
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,338
I DON'T THINK TRIBAL COUNCIL TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL, I THINK THREE

694
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,047
VOTES FROM NOW.

695
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,381
I DON'T WANT TO JUST MAKE MERGE.

696
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,549
I WANT TO WIN THIS GAME.

697
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,635
>> SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN IDOL,
RIGHT?

698
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,427
>> NO.

699
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,053
NO.

700
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:05,803
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

701
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,056
>> ISLAND OF IDOL, YOU NEVER
KNOW.

702
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,974
>> NO, SHE DOESN'T.

703
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,184
>> SERIOUSLY?

704
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:16,898
>> ELAINE GOES OFF, BECAUSE WE
KEEP STRONG, AARON AND MISSY.

705
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:17,941
THAT'S THE EASIEST BEST VOTE.

706
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,068
>> ELAINE, IF THERE'S NO IDOL.

707
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,071
>> I DON'T THINK ELAINE IS SMART
ENOUGH TO HAVE AN IDOL.

708
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:23,613
>> I'M COOL.

709
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,448
>> I SAY WE VOTE ELAINE.

710
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,408
>> ROCK 'N' ROLL, BABY.

711
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,618
ROCK 'N' ROLL.

712
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:33,039
>> HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW THAT
ERAIN HAS THE STRATEGIC MIND TO

713
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:37,252
BE ABLE TO PLAY US, BUT LIKE
EVEN IF ELAINE DOES HAVE AN

714
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,256
IDOL, I KNOW IT'S MISSY AND
ELIZABETH WOULD SPILL THE BEANS.

715
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,423
THEY WANT ELAINE OUT.

716
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,508
>> RIGHT.

717
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:50,598
>> UNLESS YOU GIRLS HAVE
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T KNOW.

718
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,891
>> NO.

719
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,853
>> TONIGHT IS AN ABSOLUTE WAR
BETWEEN LAIRO AND VOKAI, AND

720
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,563
VOKAI DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

721
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,981
WE GET TO DECIDE WHO GOES HOME.

722
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,109
FOR ME IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO
TAKE OUT LAUREN BECAUSE LAUREN

723
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,110
DOESN'T SHIELD ME.

724
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,113
LAUREN DOESN'T REALLY DO
ANYTHING FOR MY GAME.

725
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,575
BUT HONESTLY, THERE IS A REASON
TO VOTE OUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

726
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,285
THE VOKAI.

727
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:14,581
>> DAN IS A SKETCHY PERSON IN
GENERAL ON "SURVIVOR."

728
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:19,419
I SEE HIM CHECKING OUR BAGS WHEN
HE THINKS NO ONE IS WATCHING.

729
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,211
I'.

730
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,379
WATCHING HIM BECAUSE I TRUST NO
ONE.

731
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,381
DAN WOULD BE A GREAT OPTION TO
GO HOME.

732
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,466
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

733
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,010
>> VOKAI IS IN FOR A RUDE
AWAKENING.

734
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,971
I THINK TOMMY IS THE BIGGEST
THREAT.

735
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,141
HE'S GOT CLOSE TIES WITH
EVERYBODY.

736
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,643
I'VE GOT HIM IN MY SIGHT, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

737
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,396
>> THIS TRIBAL IS GOING TO BE
NUTS.

738
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,315
>> IT'S GOING TO BE NUTS.

739
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,360
BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU GOT JASON,
HE'S STRATEGIC AND I THINK HE'S

740
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,654
REALLY SMART, BUT I GOT MY
MOVES.

741
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,324
I GOT MY MOVES ON I'M WANTING TO
MAKE.

742
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,452
>> ELAINE FEELS LIKE SHE'S IN A
POWER POSITION, WHICH IS GREAT,

743
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,495
BUT SHE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY
POWER RIGHT NOW.

744
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,997
I HAVE CONTROL OF THIS GAME.

745
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,000
I CAN NOW CHOOSE WHO GOES HOME.

746
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,503
I CAN CHOOSE WHAT MOVES ARE MADE
NOW.

747
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,838
SHE WAS MY FIRST VOTE OUT.

748
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:04,213
THAT'S WHERE I WANTED TO GO.

749
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,548
I TRIED TO.

750
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,675
I PUBLICKED HARD FOR IT.

751
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,301
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

752
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,470
>> SO WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT.

753
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,513
>> I HAVE MADE SEVERAL PROMISES
IN THIS GAME.

754
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,433
SOME OF THOSE PROMISES I KEEP
AND SO I HAVEN'T.

755
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,225
THE GAME IS "SURVIVOR."

756
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:22,023
>> THIS GUARANTEES US MERGE.

757
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,191
SOMEBODY'S HEART IS GOING TO BE
BROKEN.

758
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,026
I HAVE TO BLAME SOMEBODY'S
TRUST.

759
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:30,323
A SURE VOTE WOULD BE ELAINE TO
GET THEM ON BOARD, OR I CAN STAY

760
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,075
LAIRO STRONG, MAYBE YOU END UP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE

761
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,243
NUMBERS, MAYBE YOU DON'T.

762
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,205
GOING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT'S
AN OPEN GAME.

763
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,290
AND THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE
VERY, VERY LIVE, VERY LIVE.

764
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,492
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

765
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,245
LET'S IMAGINE WE'RE IN A LIVING
ROOM, SPECIAL NIGHT, WATCHING

766
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,246
"SURVIVOR."

767
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,582
WE HAVE SOME DOUGHNUTS.

768
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:26,254
TRIBAL COUNCIL COMES AND IT'S
FOUR VOKAI, FOUR LAIRO.

769
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,258
JASON, HOW FAR INTO THE SCREEN
ARE YOU LEANING IN ANTICIPATION?

770
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,594
>> JEFF, WE'RE IN A UNIQUE
SITUATION HERE THAT THIS EARLY

771
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:38,099
IN THE GAME WE'RE AT A 4-4 TIE
SPLIT.

772
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,310
AND TO BE AT THIS POINT, BECAUSE
OF A SWAP, IT'S WILD.

773
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,105
SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT VOTE
TONIGHT:.

774
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,733
>> Jeff: ELAINE, YOU ARE
NODDING.

775
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,153
>> YEAH, IT'S LIKE AN OLD
FASHIONED STANDOFF.

776
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,362
WE'VE DRAWN THE LINE IN THE
SAND.

777
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,365
WE KNOW WHICH SIDE EVERYBODY
STANDS ON, AND I AIN'T SCARED OF

778
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,783
NO FIGHT.

779
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,951
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

780
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,494
BRING IT AS FAR AS I'M
CONCERNED.

781
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,871
>> I HOPE SHE GOT IT.

782
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,165
>> Jeff: SO AARON, THIS IS A
BIG MOMENT.

783
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:06,252
IF YOU GO 4-4 AND YOU GO TO
ROCKS, THEN EVERYBODY IS PLAYING

784
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,462
THE SAME GAME.

785
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,297
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE PERSON TO BE
ON A DIFFERENT SIDE AND THE

786
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,174
WHOLE PLAN BLOWS UP.

787
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,341
>> SURE.

788
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,011
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE
MAGNITUDE OF WHAT'S ABOUT TO

789
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,472
HAPPEN SOME TONIGHT WHETHER YOU
END UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE OR THE

790
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,601
WRONG SIDE, YOU HAVE TO PICK UP
THE PIECES AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

791
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,727
BEST FOR YOUR GAME.

792
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,355
>> LOOK, THERE IS A LOT OF VOKAI
STILL LEFT IN THIS GAME.

793
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,859
SO US FOUR FLIPPING MAKES NO
SENSE, SO FAR GET IS ON OUR BACK

794
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:30,985
AND WE'RE LABELED A FLIPPER.

795
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:34,030
THEY CAN NOW JOIN OUR SIDE AND
THEN THEY'RE IN WITH US.

796
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:38,659
THEY CAN BE A VOKAI.

797
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,660
>> HE'S SELLING THEM KOOL-AID.

798
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,331
>> BUT IT IS THEM ASKING US TO
EAT ONE OF OUR OWN.

799
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,291
HOW DO I TRUST WE DO THAT AND
DOWN THE LINE THEY WILL CARRY

800
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:45,917
US?

801
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,711
>> WE GO BACK SEVEN STRONG.

802
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,339
WE'RE SHOWING EACH OTHER THAT
THE PEOPLE WHO REMAIN ARE THE

803
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,008
PEOPLE WE ALL WANT TO PLAY WITH,
AND --

804
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:56,803
>> BUT IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR YOU
TO SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE ON

805
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,137
THE TOP OF THE NUMBERS.

806
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:02,308
WITH WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM, SO OH,
TRUST, TRUST, TRUST.

807
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,353
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I KNOW
AFTER TONIGHT, THERE'S GOING TO

808
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,397
BE PEOPLE THAT'S GOING TO BE
HURT FEELINGS, YOU KNOW, AND

809
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,191
WE'LL HAVE THE MOVE FORWARD
BECAUSE SOMEBODY GOES HOME FROM

810
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:14,529
MY FOUR, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
SUCK IT UP BUTTERCUP AND MOVE

811
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,571
ON.

812
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,198
SO THEY'LL HAVE TO DO THE SAME
IF IT'S ONE OF THEM.

813
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,535
>> Jeff: JASON, THIS IS THE
ART OF NEGOTIATION.

814
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,285
RIGHT?

815
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,204
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM.

816
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,206
NOBODY ACTUALLY DOES HAVE
LEVERAGE IF IT'S 4-4.

817
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:30,086
>> JEFF, THE GROUP WITH THE
UPPER HAND IS THE GROUP THAT IS

818
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,172
MORE LIKELY TO DRAW ROCKS, AND
RIGHT NOW I KNOW THAT IT'S MY

819
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,216
GROUP THAT'S MORE WILLING TO
DRAW ROCKS.

820
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,676
>> I'M WILLING THE DRAW ROCKS.

821
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,511
>> I'M WILLING TO DRAW A ROCK.

822
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,054
>> I THINK ALL OF US ARE.

823
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,055
>> I'LL DRAW A ROCK.

824
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:42,390
>> Jeff: SO TOMMY, YOU'RE
PREPARED TO GO HOME.

825
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:47,103
>> SMIEJS YOU HAVE TO TAKE
EXTREME RISKS TO SET YOU UP

826
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,605
REALLY WELL FOR THE REST OF THE
GAME.

827
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:57,029
>> JEFF, YEAH, I DON'T LIKE
ROCKS.

828
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,740
>> SHE GOT IT.

829
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:05,705
>> AND I JUST WANT TO GO AHEAD
AND APOLOGIZE BEFOREHAND.

830
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,708
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING TO READ.

831
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,542
>> Jeff: OKAY.

832
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,752
>> ALL RIGHT.

833
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:17,633
IT SAYS YOU HAVE EARNED THE
BLOCK A VOTE ADVANTAGE.

834
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,761
WHEN IT'S TIME TO VOTE, DECLARE
WHICH PLAYER YOU WANT TO BLOCK

835
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:25,433
FROM CASTING A VOTE, AND THAT
PERSON WILL NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE.

836
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,936
SO I'D LIKE THE PLAY THIS.

837
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,398
>> Jeff: AND WHOSE VOTE DO YOU
WANT TO BLOCK?

838
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:37,820
>> I'D LIKE THE BLOCK JASON'S
VOTE.

839
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,487
>> DAMN.

840
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,322
>> OH, MY GOD.

841
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,406
>> Jeff: ELAINE.

842
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:49,415
>> OH, MY GOD.

843
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,625
>> THANKS, ELAINE.

844
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,500
WHY ME?

845
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,460
WE COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS.

846
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:57,298
>> WE CAN STILL BE GOOD FRIENDS,
BRO.

847
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,800
>> Jeff: WOW, JASON, YOUR FACE
RIGHT NOW.

848
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,262
I THOUGHT GOING TO ROCKS WOULD
BE SOMETHING THAT IS OUT OF MY

849
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:17,944
CONTROL, BUT NOW THIS IS REALLY
OUT OF MY CONTROL.

850
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,196
>> Jeff: JASON, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS HAPPENING WITH ALL OF

851
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,155
THE TALKING NOW?

852
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,491
>> WHAT DO I THINK IS HAPPENING?

853
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,369
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

854
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:32,166
I WOULD LIKE THE KIND OF KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

855
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:41,467
>> YEAH, I THINK THEY'RE GOING
AFTER SOMEBODY ELSE.

856
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:49,350
>> Jeff: LAUREN, WHAT'S THAT
EMOTION HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

857
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,476
[CRYING]
>> WHAT?

858
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,687
>> IS THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE
FEELING THAT MAYBE YOU WILL BE

859
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,980
GOING HOME?

860
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:58,526
>> I MEAN, I'VE BEEN DREAMING OF
BEING HERE SINCE I WAS 11 YEARS

861

OLD.

862
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,530
IT SUCKS.

863
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,407
IT SUCKS.

THE ROAD FOR YOU, WHAT'S IT BEEN

865
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,536

866
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,539
>> A LOT LESS THAN I HOPED, TOM
BRADY HONEST.

867
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,376
I'LL BE INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED
THAT THIS IS THE WAY IT ENDS.

868
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,795
>> Jeff: TOMMY, HOW DOES THIS
SIT WITH YOU?

869
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,463
>> IT'S AWFUL.

TONIGHT, WHAT'S THE STORY?

>> JEFF, WITH EVERY WAKING
MOMENT THAT I'VE BEEN HERE, I

873
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:34,562
HAVE BEEN THINKING WHAT IF THIS
IS THE END, WHAT IF THESE ARE MY

874
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,106
LAST MOMENTS ON "SURVIVOR."

875

I'M DYING.

884
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,100
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AN YOU WANT

885
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,478
THE PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE
TIME TO DO SO.

886
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,312
OKAY.

887
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:03,442

YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

OF A THREAT, WHICH I'LL WEAR

00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:44,812
LIKE A BADGE OF HONOR.

934
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,854
THAT'S LIFE, MAN.

935
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,732
YOU CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL.
