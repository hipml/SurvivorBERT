1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:03,586
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,964
"SURVIVOR": AT OMETEPE, MATT AND

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,590
ANDREA FORMED A TIGHT BOND RIGHT

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,591
FROM THE START.

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,094
AND BOSTON ROB SAW THEM AS A
THREAT.

6
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,012
>> I KNOW HOW STRONG A PAIR CAN

7
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:13,680
BE IN THIS GAME.

8
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,099
>> Jeff: SO HE SENT MATT TO

9
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,226
REDEMPTION ISLAND, BUT MATT

10
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,811
REFUSED TO GO AWAY, DEFEATING

11
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,229
EVERYONE HE FACED, WAITING FOR

12
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,648
HIS SHOT TO RE-ENTER THE GAME.

13
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:28,319
FOR THE FIFTH TIME, MATT STAYS
ALIVE.

14
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:32,031
UNDER ROB'S LEADERSHIP, THE
OMETEPE TRIBE WAS FLYING HIGH

15
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,620
EVEN AS OLD NEMESIS PHILLIP WAS

16
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,122
BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE PART OF
THE TEAM.

17
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,166
>> RIGHT NOW I'M ON TOP OF THE
EARTH.

18
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,126
>> Jeff: AND ROB HAD ANOTHER
ACE UP HIS SLEEVE.

19
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,464
>> IT'S A CLUE WRAPPED UP LIKE A
COOKIE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER

20
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,340
WHAT IT SAYS
BECAUSE I HAVE THE IDOL

21
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:54,304
SO I WILL JUST THROW IT AWAY.

22
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,931
>> Jeff: ON THE ZAPATERA TRIBE,

23
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,350
RALPH ALSO HAD A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

24
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,643
>> AWESOME!

25
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,436
>> Jeff: BUT HIS TRIBE WAS IN
TROUBLE.

26
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,480
AT THE LAST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE...

27
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,649
SURVIVORS READY?

28
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,984
GO!

29
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,654
OMETEPE OPENING UP A BIG LEAD
RIGHT NOW.

30
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,949
EVERYBODY THROUGH THE WALL.

31
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,493
GRANT DOES IT!

32
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,119
OMETEPE BEAT ZAPATERA FOR THE

33
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,788
THIRD TIME IN A ROW.

34
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,501
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT CAME DOWN

35
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,460
TO SARITA, WHO WAS LOYAL,

36
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,713
OR DAVID, WHO WAS BETTER AT
CHALLENGES.

37
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,925
SARITA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

38
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,718
WITH SARITA OFF TO REDEMPTION

39
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,719
ISLAND, THE ZAPATERA FIVE ARE

40
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,097
HOPING FOR A LITTLE REDEMPTION
OF THEIR OWN.

41
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,194
>> YEAH.

42
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,695
>> WE SURE BLINDSIDED HER.

43
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,406
>> TONIGHT, WE VOTED SARITA OFF

44
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,159
BECAUSE WE FELT LIKE SARITA WAS

45
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,036
THE WEAKEST LINK WHEN IT CAME TO

46
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,247
HELPING US WIN THE CHALLENGES.

47
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,419
>> YEAH.

48
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,213
I WAS GOING
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.

49
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,297
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

50
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,215
I UNDERSTAND.

51
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:12,882
>> WE ARE DWINDLING.

52
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,176
WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE NOW AND WE

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,719
HAVE TO WIN THE NEXT CHALLENGE--

54
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,222
WE HAVE TO WIN THE NEXT TWO
CHALLENGES.

55
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,348
>> WE HAVE TO EVEN THIS THING
OUT.

56
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,725
NO ONE LIKES A LANDSLIDE.

57
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,726
>> WE'VE GOTTA WIN.

58
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,394
>> DO BATTLE.

59
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,437
>> EXACTLY.

60
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,442
>> HELLO?

61
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,360
MATT?

62
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,361
>> HEY.

63
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,237
>> IT'S SARITA.

64
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,823
>> HEY, SARITA.

65
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,077
( LAUGHS )

66
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,912
SARITA FROM THE ZAPATERA TRIBE

67
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,289
ARRIVED AT MI CASA ON REDEMPTION

68
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,498
ISLAND THIS EVENING.

69
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,046
I WAS QUITE HAPPY TO SEE HER

70
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,923
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE

71
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,925
TOO INCREDIBLY TOUGH.

72
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,428
YEAH, I'VE JUST BEEN HEARING

73
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,762
HORROR STORIES FROM ZAPATERA.

74
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,430
LIKE, WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON?

75
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,891
>> IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD.

76
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,602
THERE ARE A LOT OF AMAZING
PEOPLE.

77
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,771
JULIE, MIKE, STEVE, RALPH--
GOOD PEOPLE.

78
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,982
I LOVE THAT I CAN SHARE THE GOOD

79
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,443
PARTS OF ZAPATERA WITH HIM,

80
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,277
LIKE, HEY, HERE'S WHO YOU WANT

81
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,779
TO STICK WITH.

82
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,739
HERE WHO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT.

83
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,616
I LOVE BEING ABLE TO GIVE THAT

84
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,159
TO HIM BECAUSE HE IS A REALLY
GOOD KID.

85
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,120
YOU SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT OPEN
TO MIKE.

86
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,747
HE'S DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE
PLAYER.

87
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,956
>> I'M SORT OF THINKING THAT

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,587
SARITA MIGHT BE THE LAST OF THE
DUELERS BEFORE THE MERGE.

89
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,172
I TRUST THE INFORMATION THAT

90
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,966
SHE'S BEEN GIVING ME ABOUT THE
ZAPATERA TRIBE.

91
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,801
>> HE'S SO EX-MARINE.

92
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,510
HE'S A TOTAL BAD ASS.

93
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,386
>> UP UNTIL THIS POINT, I WAS

94
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,306
SAYING IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME

95
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,183
TO HOP BACK ON THE TRAIN WITH

96
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,809
OMETEPE, BUT IF ALL GOES AS

97
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,686
PLANNED AND I CAN WIN THE DUEL,

98
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,562
IT WOULD BE QUITE THE OPPORTUNE

99
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,148
MOMENT TO STRIKE AND TAKE OUT

100
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:53,733
THE OMETEPE TRIBE.

101
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,927
>> I HAVE MAIL.

102
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,637
>> WHOOO!

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,222
>> "ANOTHER DUEL TO BE PLAYED

104
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,682
THIS MORNING AND YOU KNOW IT'S

105
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,391
ANYONE'S GAME.

106
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,977
THIS TIME YOUR WHOLE TRIBE WILL

107
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,521
WIN THIS AS ANOTHER BUFF GOES IN
THE FLAMES."

108
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,480
>> I WONDER IF IT'S THE LAST
ONE.

109
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,189
>> MERGE.

110
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,691
>> MAY BE, MAN.
>> COULD BE.

111
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,525
>> TODAY WE GOT TREE MAIL THAT

112
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,988
INDICATED THAT WE ARE GOING TO

113
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,531
SEE A DUEL AT REDEMPTION ISLAND

114
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,491
WITH BOTH TRIBES FULLY PRESENT.

115
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,493
SO WE SUSPECT THERE'S GOING TO

116
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,536
BE A MERGE.

117
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,162
>> WE SHOULD PROBABLY BRING OUR

118
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,833
STUFF JUST IN CASE.

119
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,875
>> I AGREE.

120
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,085
>> IF THERE'S A MERGE, WE'RE

121
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,503
PROBABLY GOING TO THEIR BEACH.

122
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,212
>> REALLY?
>> YEAH.

123
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,172
>> IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO LEAVE

124
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,215
OUR STUFF HERE.

125
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,758
>> MY GUT IS THEY'D COME HERE.

126
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,093
>> YOU'RE A GAMBLING MAN.

127
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,845
>> I'M A GAMBLING MAN.
>> OKAY.

128
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,722
THEN WHAT DO WE WANT TO RISK?

129
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,556
GOING TO THE OTHER BEACH AND

130
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,390
LOSING EVERYTHING?

131
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,768
BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY.

132
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,854
>> I KIND OF WENT THROUGH, YOU

133
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,397
KNOW, I'M SICK AND TIRED OF

134
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,899
BEING THE REDHEADED STEPCHILD!

135
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:17,900
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, FRANKLY?

136
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,361
I'VE LEARNED A LOT PLAYING THE
GAME WITH ROB.

137
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,571
SO THIS IS A WHOLE NEW GAME NOW.

138
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,698
WE'VE GOT THE NUMBERS.

139
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,908
AND IF IT IS A MERGE, I'M VERY

140
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,243
COMFORTABLE STAYING WITH THE

141
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,579
OMETEPE TRIBE.

142
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,913
>> WOW, WE'RE ALL GOING.

143
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,791
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MIGHT
MEAN?

144
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,625
A DUEL FOLLOWED BY A MERGE.

145
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,753
>> WOULDN'T THAT BE CRAZY?

146
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,629
>> MY PERSONAL HOPE IS WE GET TO

147
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,590
A MERGE, I'M READY TO SINK MY

148
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,467
TEETH IN TO SOME OF THE OTHER

149
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,093
MEMBERS OF THE OMETEPE TRIBE.

150
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,429
ROB IS THE OBVIOUS TARGET.

151
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,557
HE'S A MASTER AT THIS GAME.

152
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,768
I'M READY TO GET IN THE RING AND

153
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,602
GO TOE TO TOE WITH THAT GUY.

154
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,069
>> TODAY IS DUEL NUMBER 6
FOR ME.

155
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,612
I'M REALLY NERVOUS BECAUSE I CUT

156
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,906
MY FOOT PRETTY BADLY.

157
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,492
IT'S RIGHT ON THE OUTSIDE OF MY

158
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,453
FOOT SO IF IT'S ONE OF THOSE

159
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,496
ENDURANCE CHALLENGES IT'S GOING

160
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,247
TO BE REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT.

161
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,791
BUT GOD GAVE ME THIS PLATFORM

162
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,085
AND I'M GOING TO DO THE BEST I

163
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,961
CAN AND HOPEFULLY COME OUT WITH
ANOTHER VICTORY.

164
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,922
>> MATT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO

165
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,632
BEAT BUT I AM GOING IN WITH SO
MUCH CONFIDENCE.

166
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,717
I THINK I'M A WORTHY OPPONENT.

167
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,644
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

168
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,978
THE COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S
DUEL.

169
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:40,983
MATT WILL BE BATTLING AGAINST
SARITA.

170
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,402
VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

171
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,534
WELCOME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND
ARENA.

172
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,494
WE'VE INVITED EVERYBODY FROM

173
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,663
BOTH TRIBES TO WITNESS YOUR DUEL
TODAY.

174
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,665
BECAUSE THE WINNER OF TODAY'S

175
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,709
DUEL WILL GO BACK IN THE GAME.

176
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,174
>> IF MATT WINS, IT'S NO GOOD

177
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,176
FOR ME PERSONALLY BECAUSE YOU

178
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,011
KNOW, I'M ONE WHO SENT HIM TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

179
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,680
SO I'M FIGURING HE'S HOLDING
THAT AGAINST ME.

180
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,182
AND THERE'S A POSSIBILITY HE

181
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,809
MIGHT DEFECT TO THE OTHER TEAM.

182
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,686
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

183
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,354
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S DUEL, YOU

184
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,231
WILL USE YOUR ARMS TO BRACE

185
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,692
YOURSELF AGAINST TWO WALLS WHILE

186
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,611
YOUR BARE FEET ARE PERCHED ON

187
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,321
VERY NARROW FOOTHOLDS.

188
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,866
EVERY 15 MINUTES, YOU'LL MOVE TO

189
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,200
A SMALLER FOOTHOLD.

190
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,245
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS

191
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,706
THIS DUEL, RE-ENTERS THE GAME,

192
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,374
AND CONTINUES THEIR QUEST FOR

193
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,876
THE MILLION-DOLLAR PRIZE.

194
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,710
LOSER IS OUT FOR GOOD.

195
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,045
THIS IS IT.

196
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,338
ONE SHOT.

197
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,715
IT'S A BIGGIE.

198
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,884
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

199
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,854
ALL RIGHT, THIS DUEL IS ON.

200
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,026
YOU'LL STAY ON THIS FOOTHOLD FOR

201
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,278
15 MINUTES.

202
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,696
IF YOU'RE STILL GOING, THEN

203
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,741
WE'LL MOVE TO THE NEXT SMALLER
FOOTHOLD.

204
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,076
>> ZEN, SARITA.

205
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,870
>> PIECE OF CAKE.

206
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,137
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE

207
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:33,846
BEEN UP THERE 15 MINUTES.

208
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,766
IT IS TIME TO MOVE DOWN TO THE

209
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,602
NEXT FOOTHOLD.

210
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:45,107
YOU'VE GOT 15 SECONDS...
GET SITUATED....

211
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:52,782
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

212
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,825
THE CHALLENGE CONTINUES.

213
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,411
>> ALL RIGHT, MATT.

214
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,913
>> Jeff: YOU'LL BE ON THIS

215
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,457
FOOTHOLD FOR 15 MINUTES.

216
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,833
NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY DOWN TO

217
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,919
ABOUT A QUARTER INCH OF WOOD

218
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,504
THAT YOUR FEET ARE RESTING ON.

219
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:11,342
IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE MORE
PAINFUL.

220
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,469
PHILLIP, GIVE US SOME INSIGHT.

221
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,221
THE SITUATION LIKE THIS, WHAT DO

222
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,847
DO YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL?

223
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,642
>> WELL, THE BUSCHUTO CODE WAS

224
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,145
HOW A SAMURAI KNEW HE HAD TO

225
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,355
CONDUCT HIS LIFE WHEN HE WAS

226
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,439
FACING DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES,

227
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,857
AND THEY HAD A WHOLE STRATEGY

228
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:32,321
ABOUT THE TASK AT HAND, AND THEY

229
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,656
SHAMED THEIR FEUDAL LORD, THEY

230
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,324
WOULD HAVE TO CUT THEMSELVES.

231
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,285
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THEY

232
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,828
LOOKED FOR, AND THEY LOOKED FOR

233
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,788
YOU TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE, AND

234
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,123
THEN THEY WOULD STRIKE.

235
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,000
AND THE BUSCHUTO CODE GAVE

236
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,628
THEM A WAY TO LIVE AS THE BIBLE.

237
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,713
FOR MATT, IT'S GIVEN HIM
A WAY TO LIVE.

238
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,966
I KNOW HE KNOWS IT'S ALL UP
HERE.

239
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,843
AND AS LONG AS HE KEEPS THAT

240
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,053
FOCUS, HE'LL BE JUST FINE.

241
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,893
>> THANKS, PHILLIP.

242
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,855
>> Jeff: IT IS TIME NOW TO

243
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,900
MOVE TO THE THIRD AND FINAL
FOOTHOLD.

244
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,862
YOU'LL HAVE 15 SECONDS,
GET SETTLED.

245
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,488
MAKE SURE YOU'RE REALLY LOCKED

246
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,032
IN BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE

247
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,745
STUCK HERE TILL THE END OF THE
CHALLENGE.

248
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:28,419
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

249
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,670
GOOD WORK, SARITA.

250
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,504
>> GOOD JOB, SARITA.
ZEN, BABY.

FINAL FOOTHOLD.

253
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,966
THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT NOW.

254
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,011
WE GO UNTIL ONE OF YOU DROPS.

255
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,722
THIS IS IT.

256
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,265
YOU'RE ON PROBABLY AN EIGHT OF

257
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,892
AN INCH OF WOOD RIGHT NOW.

258
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,893
THERE'S VERY LITTLE THERE.

259
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,894
>> GOOD JOB, SARITA.

260
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:50,441
STAY THERE.

261
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:50,900
>> YOU OWN THIS, SARITA.

262
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,736
YOU OWN THIS.

263
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,071
>> Jeff: WOMEN HAVE DONE VERY

00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:55,988
WELL IN THIS CHALLENGE,
HISTORICALLY.

265
00:10:56,072 --> 00:11:05,414
>> LOOKING GOOD, MATT.

266
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,584

KEEP DIGGING.

280
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,863
YOU WANT A SHOT BACK IN THIS
GAME, YOU GOT IT.

281
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,959
SARITA DROPS OUT OF THE DUEL.

282
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,337
MATT SEIZES THE MOMENT AND WILL

283
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,923
RE-ENTER THIS GAME.

>> I'M BUMMED.

289
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,147
I THOUGHT I HAD IT.

290
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,481
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SARITA,

291
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,483
YOU ARE OUT OF THIS GAME.

292
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,819
YOUR SHOT AT THE MILLION DOLLARS
IS OVER.

293
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,529
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

294
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,780

YOU ARE BACK IN THIS GAME.

301
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,508
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR BUFF OFF, TOO.

302
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,179
I'VE GOT A NEW ONE FOR YOU.

303
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,389
IT'S CLEAN.
>> ALL RIGHT!

304
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,349
>> Jeff: AND IT'S A DIFFERENT
COLOR.

305
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,018
BECAUSE WE ARE MERGED.

306
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,060

00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:10,873
ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU GOING TO
MERGE TO A NEW BEACH.

311
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,916
HERE'S A MAP.

312
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,503
ONE MORE THING-- BEGINNING WITH

313
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,837
THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

314
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,508
REDEMPTION ISLAND STARTS AGAIN.

315
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,884
>> WHAT!

316
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,553
>> Jeff: THAT MEANS, MATT, YOU
COULD BE VOTED OUT AGAIN

317
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,513
AND SENT RIGHT BACK HERE.

318
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:30,059
>> GUYS, JUST PLEASE,
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

319
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,352
>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD OUT,

320
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,187
LEAVE YOUR OLD BUFFS BEHIND.

321
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,106
>> THIS IS-- THIS IS CRAZY.

322
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,734
I'M ABSOLUTELY STOKED TO BE BACK

323
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,069
IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW.

324
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:40,903
I MEAN, I DEFINITELY THINK MY

325
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,280
TIME ON REDEMPTION ISLAND GIVES

326
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,156
ME AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE I HAD

327
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,534
SIX PEOPLE BREAK DOWN EVERYTHING

328
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,243
THAT WAS GOING ON IN EACH TRIBE.

329
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,453
NOW I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF
OPTIONS.

330
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,080
I CAN EITHER GO WITH OMETEPE.

331
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,706
I CAN GO WITH ZAPATERA.

332
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,250
BUT I'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL

333
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,084
BECAUSE ONE SLIP-UP OUT HERE AND

334
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,127
YOU'RE GONE.

335
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,603
>> YES, YES, YES!

336
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,651
>> WALKING UP AND SEEING ALL

337
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,279
THAT FOOD WAS LIKE A DREAM COME
TRUE.

338
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,947
MY WHOLE BODY GOT HAPPY.

339
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,575
I FELT LIKE JUST A LITTLE KID AT
A CARNIVAL.

340
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,828
( SCREAMING )

341
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,748
>> OH, MY GOD.

342
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,125
>> OH, THANK YOU!

343
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,293
>> THIS IS HEAVEN.

344
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,627
>> OH, MY GOD!

345
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,712
>> WE SAT DOWN.

346
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,715
WE HAD A GREAT PICNIC, FINALLY
GOT SOME GOOD FOOD.

347
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,260
WE HAD PRUSCIUTTO, BREAD,
WINE, LOCAL BEER,

348
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,971
BIG DEAL OF MIXED NUTS, DATES.

349
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,514
WE'VE GOT CHICKEN TO COOK
TONIGHT.

350
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,433
LIFE'S PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW.

351
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,477
>> YOU GUYS WHAT, DO YOU THINK
OF A NAME?

352
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,770
>> WHO'S GOT SOME SPANISH NAMES.

353
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,647
>> MURLONIO MEANS
"FROM THE SEA UNITED."

354
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,901
>> OH, MY GOSH, THAT'S
BEAUTIFUL.

355
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,820
>> DOES EVERYONE LIKE THAT?

356
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:05,946
>> SAY IT ONE MORE TIME?

357
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,032
>> MURLONIO.

358
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,366
MURLONIO DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

359
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,162
IT'S AN INSIDE JOKE BETWEEN
AMBER AND I.

360
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,456
SHE HAS A BUNCH OF STUFFED
ANIMALS AND MURLONIO IS THE

361
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,041
RINGLEADER SO THAT'S THE NAME OF
OUR NEW TRIBE.

362
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,836
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, MURLONIO!

363
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,382
>> FIRST THING ON MY MIND WHEN I

364
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,175
FOUND OUT WE HAD TO BUILD A NEW

365
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,801
SHELTER WAS OH, MY GOSH.

366
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,427
WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS AGAIN.

367
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,179
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

368
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,013
ACTUALLY THAT WE DID BUILD THE

369
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,264
SHELTER ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE

370
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,265
THAT'S THE ICEBREAKER.

371
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,819
>> LET'S THROW THE DECK IN.

372
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,698
>> MATT IS THE KEY LINCHPIN TO

373
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,741
THIS WHOLE DEAL.

374
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,701
HE WAS VOTED OUT BY THE OMETEPE

375
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,244
TRIBE, AND I THINK AT THIS

376
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,120
POINT, HE DOESN'T HAVE A HUGE

377
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,498
AMOUNT OF LOYALTY TOWARDS THEM.

378
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,500
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE MATT AND

379
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,043
ANDREA ARE VERY TIGHT, SO THIS

380
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,211
IS WHERE I GOTTA GO FOR BROKE.

381
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,214
I GOTTA TRY AND MAKE AS BIG OF A

382
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,757
MOVE AS I CAN BECAUSE I DON'T

383
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,675
WANT TO JUST JUST SIT BACK AND

384
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,259
GET DEALT WITH WHEN IT'S MY TIME

385
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,260
AT THE HANDS OF BOSTON ROB.

386
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,556
>> THE WAY IT STANDS RIGHT NOW,

387
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,350
IF ROB GETS WHAT HE WANTS, HE'S

388
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,560
JUST GOING TO TAKE US OUT ONE BY

389
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,187
ONE, AND THEN I THINK IT'S

390
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,814
PROBABLY GOING TO BE YOU,

391
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,523
ANDREA, AND PHILLIP NEXT.

392
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,733
AND YOU ANDREA ARE THE BIGGEST

393
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,276
CHESS PIECES IN THIS GAME RIGHT

394
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,319
NOW AND I TRUST YOU GUYS
WHOLEHEARTEDLY.

395
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,238
AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYS CAN

396
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,115
TEAM UP WITH US, I CAN ASSURE

397
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,702
YOU THAT WE CAN GO TO THE FINAL
FOUR.

398
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,411
>> I BELIEVE YOU.
>> OKAY?

399
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,871
>> AND I'M OKAY WHITTLING DOWN

400
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,415
MY TRIBE TO HONOR MY COMMITMENT

401
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,083
TO YOU AND ANDREA BECAUSE YOU'RE

402
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,251
INTEGRAL PARTS TO THIS THING.

403
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,127
>> I WANT TO BE IN THIS GAME AS

404
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,586
LONG AS I CAN SO I'M REALLY JUST

405
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,921
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST

406
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,297
FOR ME AND WHICH ROUTE TO TAKE

407
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,091
BECAUSE LAST TIME I WAS COASTING

408
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,551
AND WAITING TO PLAY THE GAME AND

409
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,635
THIS TIME I CAN'T BE NEAR AS

410
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,886
PASSIVE BECAUSE I'LL BE BACK ON

411
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,263
REDEMPTION ISLAND IN A JIFFY.

412
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,347
>> HERE'S THE DEAL.

413
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,102
IF YOU NEED THE IDOL,
YOU'VE GOT IT.

414
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,228
>> I LIKE THE SOUND OF IT.
>> YEAH.

415
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,815
>> BUT I JUST GOTTA TALK THINGS
OVER WITH ANDREA.

416
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,567
>> IT IS TRULY IN HER BEST
INTEREST AS WELL.

417
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,192
>> YEAH, IT IS.

418
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,797
>> ...AND IT'S LEAKING LIKE A
SIEVE

419
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,134
ON THE BACK HALF WHERE
ZAPATERA IS.

420
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,473
>> THERE'S A DIVISION BETWEEN

421
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,348
US, AND IT'S PRETTY TOUGH BEING

422
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,268
ON THE DOWN SIDE OF A 7-5 TRIBE.

423
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,688
ANDREA AND MATT, I HOPE THEY'RE

424
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,023
READY TO SWITCH SIDES.

425
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,358
OTHERWISE, WE'RE DEAD.

426
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,326
>> WHEN YOU WERE BLINDSIDED,
I HAD NO IDEA.

427
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,871
>> LET ME TELL YOU THIS RIGHT
NOW.

428
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,164
RIGHT NOW,
YOU ARE MY CLOSEST ALLY.

429
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,373
>> GOOD.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

430
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,834
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WERE THINKING.

431
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,377
>> OKAY, THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

432
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,838
I WANT TO TAKE OUT THE OMETEPE
TRIBE.

433
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,256
BECAUSE I'M HONESTLY AT THE

434
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,549
BOTTOM OF THE ALLIANCE.

435
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,383
I WAS THINKING, LIKE, WE VOTE

436
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,512
STEVE OUT, AND THEN WE VOTE

437
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,679
PHILLIP OUT.

438
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,473
OMETEPE THINKS EVERYTHING IS

439
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,975
HUNKY DORY AND THAT'S WHEN WE
BLINDSIDE ROB.

440
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,310
>> OH, MY GOD!
I'M SO NERVOUS.

441
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,021
>> JUST STOP. JUST CALM DOWN
AND JUST HEAR ME OUT.

442
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,397
THIS GAME RESPECTS BIG MOVES.

443
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,358
>> YEAH.
>> IT DOES.

444
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,192
AND THIS IS A HUGE MOVE.

445
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,153
>> RIGHT NOW
I AM TIGHT WITH ROB--

446
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,446
I HAVE TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

447
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,074
WE CAN ONLY TALK TO EACH OTHER
ABOUT THIS.

448
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,200
>> WE CANNOT SAY
ANYTHING TO THEM.

449
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,369
I WILL CONSIDER THAT WE HAD THIS
A LONG TIME FROM NOW.

450
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,746
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH CUTTING

451
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,706
THOSE TWO BECAUSE THEY KIND OF

452
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,582
BACKSTABBED US IN THE BEGINNING.

453
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,210
>> YEAH.
>> I REALLY LIKE MATT, BUT HE

454
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,379
HAD THIS IDEA THAT HE WANTED TO

455
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,756
BLINDSIDE THE OMETEPE TRIBE,

456
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,924
AND IN THE BACK OF MY MIND I'M

457
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,633
THINKING, THIS COULD BE BAD.

458
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,425
IT'S EXTREMELY RISKY FOR ME TO

459
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,845
JUMP SHIP AT THIS POINT.

460
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,680
BUT I'M DEFINITELY KEEPING MY
OPTIONS OPEN.

461
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:15,779
>> HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

462
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,948
WHAT ARE YOU READING OVER THERE?

463
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:22,077
>> MATTHEW, THE STORY OF JESUS'
ESCAPE TO EGYPT.

464
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,327
>> FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT.

465
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,249
>> YEAH.

466
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,418
ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS
"SURVIVOR"?

467
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,378
>> YEAH AND THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY

468
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,338
TO YOU ALL, BUT AFTER I BEAT

469
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,716
STEPHANIE, IT WAS LIKE GOD

470
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,593
WANTED ME TO WIN REDEMPTION
ISLAND.

471
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,887
I REALLY FEEL I WAS PUT HERE FOR

472
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,472
A REASON, AND THAT THAT REASON

473
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,183
WAS, I BELIEVE, TO HONOR MY GOD.

474
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,810
SO I'M MORALLY CONFLICTED HERE

475
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,312
BECAUSE I REALLY GENUINELY CARE

476
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,899
ABOUT EVERYONE ON THE FORMER
OMETEPE TRIBE.

477
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,318
PART OF ME WANTS TO DO THE BIG
"SURVIVOR" MOVE.

478
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,945
HOWEVER, RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE

479
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,488
MY HEART'S ALMOST TELLING ME NOT

480
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,949
TO AND JUST TO STICK WITH
OMETEPE.

481
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,076
>> "MAN DOES NOT LIVE ON

482
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,620
BREAD ALONE BUT ON EVERY WORD

483
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,288
THAT COMES FROM THE MOUTH OF
GOD."

484
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,165
THAT'S JUST SUCH BEAUTIFUL
LANGUAGE, YOU KNOW?

485
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,090
WHAT WOULD I REALLY SAY?

486
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,136
THERE'S LIKE A CHRISTIAN

487
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:21,845
COALITION BREWING HERE IN
NICARAGUA.

488
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,972
LOOK, I GOT NOTHING AGAINST GOD.

489
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,849
I MEAN, I GO TO CHURCH ON

490
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,935
SUNDAY, BUT ANY TIME A GROUP OF

491
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,269
INDIVIDUALS LIKES THE SAME

492
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,647
THING, I DON'T LIKE THAT.

493
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,357
IT COULD BE ROMANTIC COMEDIES.

494
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,776
IT COULD BE OREO COOKIES.

495
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,485
IF THEY'RE ALL LIKING IT

496
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,987
TOGETHER, I WANT THAT BROKEN UP.

497
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,530
WHO KNOWS, MIKE, MAYBE HE

498
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,950
ALREADY THINKS HE'S GOING TO

499
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,660
GRAB ONE OR TWO OF THEM.

500
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,494
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

501
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,205
IF MIKE DOESN'T WIN INDIVIDUAL

502
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,831
IMMUNITY I FEEL LIKE HE SHOULD

503
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,375
BE THE FIRST SENT OVER THERE TO

504
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,418
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

505
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,174
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

506
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,310
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR

507
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,354
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?

508
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,063
>> YES.
>> YES!

509
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,231
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.

510
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,901
ANDREA, I WILL TAKE BACK TRIBAL
IMMUNITY.

511
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:22,531
TRIBAL IMMUNITY IS DONE.

512
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,365
THIS IS NOW WHAT YOU COVET.

513
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,034
>> ALL RIGHT!

514
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,702
>> OH!
>> NICE!

515
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,871
>> Jeff: INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

516
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,498
IF YOU ARE WEARING THE NECKLACE,

517
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,333
YOU ARE SAFE IN THIS GAME.

518
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,710
YOU CANNOT BE VOTED OUT.

519
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,377
WITHOUT IT, YOU ARE MOST

520
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,921
DEFINITELY VULNERABLE.

521
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,673
SHALL WE GET TO THE CHALLENGE?

522
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,091
>> YEAH.
>> YES.

523
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,175
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S

524
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,011
CHALLENGE, YOU WILL BE PERCHED

525
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,887
ON A SMALL LOG WHILE BALANCING A

526
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,389
BALL ON A WOODEN DISK.

527
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,224
AT REGULAR INTERVALS, WE WILL

528
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:52,394
ADD MORE BALLS, MAKING IT MORE
DIFFICULT.

529
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,271
IF AT ANY POINT A BALL FALLS

530
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,897
OFF, YOU'RE OUT OF THE
CHALLENGE.

531
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,442
>> WHOA!
>> Jeff: LAST PERSON LEFT

532
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,068
STANDING WINS IMMUNITY AND IS

533
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,737
SAFE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

534
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,571
LOSERS, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED

535
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,074
OUT AND SENT TO REDEMPTION

00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,954
PHILLIP ALREADY HAVING TROUBLE

549
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,623

ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO ADD
ANOTHER BALL.

562
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,283
THAT MEANS YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND
ON THE BALL ON YOUR DISK.

563
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,326
YOU ARE SAFE.

564
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,996

NOW IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT.

590
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:56,661
THREE BALLS STANDING ON
A ROUND LOG WITH THE WIND.

591
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,083
NO MORE TIME LIMITS NOW.

592

WE'RE DOWN TO SEVEN.

599
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,280

ROB NOW STRUGGLING.

601

PHILLIP WITH A GREAT RECOVERY.

602
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,452
LIKE HE'S RIDING A WAVE!

603
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,287
MATT HAS ONE BALL HANGING JUST

604
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,830
ON THE EDGE OF HIS DISK.

605
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,750
MATT IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

606
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,835
ROB DROPS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

607
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,963
PHILLIP WOBBLING.

608
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,297
CAN HE SAVE IT?

609
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,966
PHILLIP IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

610
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,425
EVERYBODY GET YOUR COMPOSURE.

611
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,636

613
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,726

615
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,149
I'M IMPRESSED.

616
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,278
YOU'RE GOING A LONG TIME.

617
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:11,820
>> COME BACK HERE

618
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,322

619
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,283
>> Jeff: RALPH... ONE BALL

621
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,664
RALPH DROPS OUT OF THE
CHALLENGE.

622
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,626
WE ARE NOW DOWN TO THREE.

623
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,169
NATALIE AND STEVE NEED TO HOPE

624
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,796
FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TO MIKE

625
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,841
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, HE'S LIKE A
STATUE.

626
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,635
STEVE WITH THOSE BALLS HANGING

627
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,177
ON THE EDGE OF THE DISK.

628
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,097
FOCUS.
DON'T DRIFT.

629
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,853
STEVE IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

630
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,732
WE ARE DOWN TO THE FINAL TWO.

631
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:54,696
MIKE AND NATALIE.

632
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,407
MIKE, NO MOVEMENT AT ALL.

633
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,700
NONE.

634
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,037
IT'S LIKE THOSE BALLS ARE GLUED
TO HIS DISK.

635
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,663
NATALIE HAVING TO DO SOME

636
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,165
BALANCING, SOME RECOVERING.

637
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,890
>> Jeff: THE FIRST SIGN OF
MOVEMENT FROM MIKE.

638
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,735
MIKE FALLS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE,

639
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,072
NATALIE WINS FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY!

640
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,493
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

641
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,373
>> Jeff: NATALIE, COME ON OVER.

642
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,541
( APPLAUSE )

643
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,709
LOOK AT THAT.

644
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,211
GETTING A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

645
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,464
>> YAY!

646
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,965
>> Jeff: NATALIE, SAFE AT

647
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,050
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

648
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,927
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SHOULD

649
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,762
BE AN INTERESTING AFTERNOON.

650
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,974
11 PEOPLE, TWO NEWLY MERGED
TRIBES.

651
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,850
CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO TRIBAL,

652
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,478
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT

653
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,397
OF THIS GAME, AND THAT PERSON

654
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,898
WILL BE SENT TO REDEMPTION
ISLAND.

655
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,233
SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

656
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:13,900
NICE JOB.

657
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:14,275
>> THANK YOU.

658
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,111
( APPLAUSE )

659
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,738
>> WE'RE GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.

660
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,116
AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MATT
ABOUT FLIPPING.

661
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,951
BUT IF HE DECIDES TO JOIN FORCES

662
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,495
WITH OMETEPE TRIBE, IT COULD BE

663
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,747
ME GOING TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

664
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,425
>> GOOD JOB TODAY, MAMA.

665
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,844
>> I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, BABY.

666
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,803
ALL RIGHT!

667
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,470
>> THANK YOU.

668
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,138
>> GOOD JOB.

669
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,473
>> NATALIE WAS A CHAMP.

670
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,810
>> WHAT HAPPENED IS MY FEET WENT

671
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,978
NUMB AND THEN THEY JUST WENT
WHOOP.

672
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,814
THE CHALLENGE TODAY WAS QUITE A
BATTLE.

673
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,858
I THINK I HUNG IN THERE FOR
ABOUT 40 MINUTES.

674
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,651
I WAS IN THE ZONE.
I WAS FEELING IT.

675
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,153
I WAS LIKE I AM COMING BACK WITH

676
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,779
THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE AROUND MY

677
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,322
NECK BUT IT DIDN'T COME OUT

678
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,031
RIGHT, SO THIS FIRST VOTE

679
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,910
BETWEEN THE TRIBES IS A BIG ONE,

680
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,329
AND I MIGHT BE ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.

681
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,998
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

682
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,666
GO AFTER STEVE OR JULIE.

683
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,210
I DON'T THINK THEY SEE YOU GUYS
AS THREATS.

684
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,171
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE RALPH

685
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,047
OR ME BECAUSE I DID WELL AT

686
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,424
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE TODAY.

687
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,175
>> THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE TODAY.

688
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,217
>> ARE YOU OKAY PLAYING THE IDOL

689
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,677
FOR ME TO TRY TO WIPE OUT THEIR
VOTES?

690
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,344
>> IF WE NEED TO.
>> OKAY.

691
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,888
>> ROB IS GOING TO KNOW HE'S THE

692
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,307
SERPENT'S HEAD AND WE'RE COMING

693
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,184
AFTER HIM SO I THINK WE SHOULD

694
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,521
TAKE OUT ROB'S RIGHT-HAND MAN
AND GO GRANT.

695
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,398
THEY WON'T SEE THAT COMING.

696
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,861
THAT'S VERY SMART.

697
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:46,284
>> I LIKE IT.

698
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,619
>> PRETTY AWESOME, HUH?

699
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,204
>> I'VE GROWN SO MUCH THROUGH

700
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,415
THAT REDEMPTION ISLAND
EXPERIENCE.

701
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,709
THAT WAS A TIME WHEN I RELIED ON

702
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,503
GOD, AND I WAS TOUGH.

703
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,047
THIS ABSOLUTELY IS A GAME, BUT

704
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,549
MY HEART IS TELLING ME DON'T
CHANGE.

705
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,386
AND I WANT TO HONOR MY GOD AND
BE TRUE TO WHO I AM.

706
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,847
SO I'VE DECIDED I DON'T WANT TO
SWITCH.

707
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,224
I DON'T WANT TO FLIP.

708
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,100
AND I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO

709
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,727
HAVE PEACE
WITH WHATEVER HAPPENS.

710
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,354
I MEAN, IF IT'S GOD'S WILL,

711
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,356
HE'LL TAKE ME AS FAR AS HE WANTS
ME TO GO.

712
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,899
ROB, MIKE WAS TELLING ME, LOOK,

713
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,445
I HAVE AN IDOL FOR AND YOU
ANDREA.

714
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,821
HIM, RALPH, AND STEVE.

715
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,157
AND HE'S LIKE, "AND I COULD USE

716
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,076
YOU TO SAVE YOU WITH IT, AND

717
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:28,451
THEN IT WOULD BE YOU IN THE

718
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,245
FINAL FOUR."

719
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,038
I'M LIKE, THAT WOULD BE COOL.

720
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,416
I WANT TO GO AS FAR AS I CAN.

721
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,417
BUT I'M WITH YOU ALL.

722
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,338
I WANT TO CONTINUE RELATIONSHIPS
WITH OUR TRIBE.

723
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,422
>> THANKS, MAN.

724
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,757
THAT MEANS A LOT;
IT REALLY DOES.

725
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,300
MATT JUST TOLD ME HE WAS

726
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,053
THINKING ABOUT FLIPPING AND

727
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,096
GOING WITH ZAPATERA.

728
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,931
FIRST OF ALL, HE HAS THE

729
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,266
AUDACITY TO THINK THAT HE'S

730
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,560
GOING TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO

731
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,602
VOTE ME OUT.

732
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,104
AND THEN THE STUPIDITY TO TELL
ME THAT.

733
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,940
IT JUST CONFIRMED HE CAN'T BE
TRUSTED.

734
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,775
SO BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GIVING

735
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:05,613
HIM A ONE-WAY TICKET BACK TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

736
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,740
>> IT WOULD BE SUCH A GREAT
PLAN.

737
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,117
I HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

738
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,161
BUT MORALLY I WAS, LIKE, GOING
BACK AND FORTH.

739
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,122
I'M GLAD WE TALKED BECAUSE NOW I

740
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,958
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
ANYTHING.

741
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:22,964
ANDREA, I CAME CLEAN, TOLD HIM
ABOUT MIKE AND EVERYTHING.

742
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,509
I KNOW THEY WANTED TO BRING YOU
IN, BUT I'M NOT FLIPPING.

743
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,136
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT.

744
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,762
>> YESTERDAY, MATT AND I WERE

745
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,139
LIKE OKAY, WE'RE NOT TELLING

746
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,473
ANYBODY WHAT WE'RE PLANNING.

747
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,017
AND NOW HE'S, LIKE, THROWING ME

748
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,643
UNDER THE BUS TO ROB.

749
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,020
IT'S SO STUPID BECAUSE THAT

750
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,855
COULD HAVE SABOTAGED MY PLAN TO

751
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,981
GET TO, LIKE, THE FINAL THREE
COMPLETELY.

752
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,276
>> SO SHOULD WE VOTE FOR SOMEONE
LIKE MIKE?

753
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,319
>> I DON'T KNOW.

754
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,945
IT'S JUST LIKE YOU'RE SWINGING

755
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,155
FOR THE FENCES IN THE FIRST
INNING.

756
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,990
>> MAYBE THE SMART THING IS TO

757
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,658
GO FOR SOMEONE LIKE STEVE
OR JULIE.

758
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,659
>> I THINK STEVE.

759
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,328
I DON'T THINK THEY'D GIVE UP THE
IDOL FOR HIM.

760
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,747
>> STEVE DOESN'T DO ...
AROUND HERE, ANYWAY.

761
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:10,219
HE TOLD ME THAT HIM AND ANDREA

762
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,180
WERE GOING TO JOIN UP WITH THEM.

763
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,223
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS!
>> YUP.

764
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,184
HE'S TRYING TO GET US AGAIN.

765
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,687
IT'S GOT TO BE MATTY, BRO.

766
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,982
>> DUDE I'M-- HE'S SUCH A GOOD
CHRISTIAN GUY.

767
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,361
>> WELL, HE CAN STILL BE A GOOD
CHRISTIAN GUY.

768
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,529
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.
>> YEAH.

769
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,823
>> HE'S PLAYING BOTH SIDES
STILL. HE IS.

770
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,283
>> I LOVE HIM,
BUT HE'S JUST TOO NICE.

771
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,119
HE'S DOING THE SAME THING HE DID
THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

772
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,211
>> YEAH.

773
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,212
>> LIKE, I'M KIND OF FEELING
OSTRACIZED HERE.

774
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,047
>> YEAH.

775
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,882
LOOKING AT MATT, I CAN SEE

776
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,384
PARANOIA GETTING TO HIM, WHICH

777
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,261
IS A BEAUTIFUL THING TO HAVE AT
THIS POINT.

778
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,681
SO I THINK HE KNOWS THAT HE

779
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,100
COULD POTENTIALLY BE ON THE

780
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,267
CHOPPING BLOCK WITH THE OMETEPE
TRIBE.

781
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,228
YOU AND ANDREA
NEED TO JUMP WITH US

782
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,188
BECAUSE YOU'LL GO MUCH
FURTHER THAN YOU WILL WITH THEM.

783
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:06,109
I GUARANTEE YOU, ROB HAS GOTTEN
GUYS IN A PECKING ORDER.

784
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,443
>> I KNOW, I'M SIXTH.

785
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,570
>> YEAH, YEAH.

786
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,198
>> SO, WHAT AM I DOING TONIGHT?

787
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,120
>> EVERYBODY.
>> OKAY.

788
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,041
>> MATTY, COME OVER HERE,
PLEASE.

789
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:30,633
>> MATT SAID HE DOESN'T

790
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,593
NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT'S GOING

791
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,887
ON, AND BOSTON ROB
SNAGGED HIM UP.

792
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,681
I'M GOING TO WRITE A NOTE TO
MATT.

793
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,771
>> MATT, COULD YOU TWIST THIS
ONE RIGHT HERE?

794
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,939
>> HUH?

795
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,858
>> COULD YOU TWIST THIS RIGHT
HERE.

796
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,442
COULD YOU TWIST THAT?

797
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,902
>> RIGHT HERE?
>> YEAH.

798
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,465
>> TOP THREE, HUH?

799
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,633
THAT'S NOT BAD.

800
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,552
WE'RE ALL GETTING READY TO GO TO

801
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,597
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND MIKE SLIPS ME
THIS NOTE.

802
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,141
THIS IS MY GOLDEN TICKET TO THE
FINAL THREE.

803
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,309
SO HERE I AM, AT THE CROSSROADS

804
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,811
BETWEEN KEEPING MY WORD AND

805
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,812
BREAKING MY WORD.

806
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,521
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

807
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,523
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES THAT

808
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,484
YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING CRAZY
TONIGHT?

809
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,987
>> I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO AT
ALL, LIKE... BUT...

810
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,409
>> HE WENT ON A WALK.

811
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,122
>> TONIGHT'S VOTE IS MONUMENTAL.

812
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,665
IF THINGS GO DOWN THE WAY

813
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,501
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN,

814
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,628
THEN MATTY IS GOING HOME.

815
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,797
IF MATT AND ANDREA ARE WITH

816
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,841
THEM, THEN I'M GOING TO BE IN A
WORLD OF HURT.

817
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,842
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING DOWN.

818
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,221
>> ROB WANTS ME TO VOTE FOR

819
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,390
MATT, BUT I TRUSTED ROB ONCE

820
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,352
BEFORE, AND I GOT ROYALLY
SCREWED OVER.

821
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,229
SO IT MIGHT BE THE WISEST MOVE

822
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,856
TO FLIP WITH MATT BECAUSE I

823
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,316
COULD BE NEXT TO GO.

824
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,193
>> IT'S IN MATT'S HANDS
AT THIS POINT.

825
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,736
>> ON THE OTHER HAND, MATT'S

826
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,614
JUST SKETCHY AND HE'S FLIGHTY,
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

827
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:36,217
>> Jeff:
A LOT OF PEOPLE AT TRIBAL.

828
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,553
RALPH, WHAT'S 12 PEOPLE LIKE,
IN ONE CAMP LIVING TOGETHER?

829
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,595
>> BOY, IT'S ROUGH.

830
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,930
IT'S LIKE TWO TEAMS STILL YET.

831
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,348
WE'RE SLEEPING
IN TWO LITTLE AREAS,

832
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,767
AND AIN'T DOING A LOT OF
TALKING.

833
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,227
THEY GO THEIR WAY AND WE OUR'N.

834
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,689
>> IT'S CRAZY WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER THERE, JEFF.

835
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,566
NOBODY'S SAYING ANYTHING TO EACH
OTHER.

836
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,567
I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.

837
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,904
>> Jeff: DAVID, IS THIS WHAT
YOU EXPECTED?

838
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:57,947
>> IT IS ODD.

839
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,907
WE GOT THE REALLY BAD SIDE OF

840
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,242
THE SHELTER LAST NIGHT.

841
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,577
THEY WERE UNDER THE TARP.

842
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,828
WE WERE UNDER THE PALM FRONDS,

843
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,414
AND WE WERE SOAK WET WITHIN FIVE
MINUTES OF RAIN LAST NIGHT.

844
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,958
>> WE WON THE TARP, FIRST OF
ALL,

845
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,669
SO IF WE CHOOSE TO SLEEP
UNDER THE TARP--

846
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,962
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THE
ASTERISK--

847
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:13,921
TO WIN, THAT I DIDN'T
REALLY TRY TOO HARD.

848
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,425
>> Jeff: SO ZAPATERA DID THROW
A CHALLENGE?

849
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,969
>> YES.

850
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,430
>> JEFF, THAT'S THE DISTINCTION
BETWEEN THE TWO TRIBES.

851
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,390
BECAUSE--
>> OH, PLEASE! PLEASE.

852
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,600
>> PLEASE DON'T INTERRUPT.

853
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,434
I'LL BE COURTEOUS AND LET YOU
SPEAK.

854
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,102
DON'T INTERRUPT.

855
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:30,271
WE WOULD NEVER NOT TRY.

856
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,982
AND HERE'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY
ABOUT THAT, JEFF.

857
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,150
>> Jeff: PLEASE.

858
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,612
>> THERE ARE SOME ON THAT TRIBE,
LIKE DECEIT.

859
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,946
WHICH CAN BE BEAUTIFUL

860
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,948
AND GLORIOUS, BUT YOU KNOW WHEN

861
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,242
RECEIVED OUTWARD, IT SOMETIMES

862
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:47,121
LEAVES A STENCH SO GREAT.

863
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,497
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S PROBABLY

864
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,957
CARRYING SOMETHING PARASITIC,

865
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,378
AND, THEREFORE, YOU DON'T WANT
TO APROACH IT.

866
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,464
>> Jeff: NOW, WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS LAUGHING AT?

867
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,468
>> THAT.
>> WHATEVER PHILLIP JUST SAID.

868
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,510
IT WAS FUNNY.

869
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,013
>> IT IS TWO DIFFERENT TRIBES,

870
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,431
BUT I DON'T DISLIKE THEM AS
PEOPLE.

871
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,975
I THINK WE'RE BOTH BEING LOYAL

872
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,644
TO THE TRIBES WE ORIGINATED

873
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,521
WITH, AND THAT'S WHAT IT COMES
DOWN TO.

874
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,482
>> Jeff: AND, MATT, HERE ARE

875
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,150
YOU, FRESH BACK FROM REDEMPTION

876
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:17,193
ISLAND, COMING INTO THIS.

877
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,071
>> MAN, IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER ON
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

878
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,156
JUST NOT HAVING ALL THESE PEOPLE
AROUND.

879
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,451
I'VE HAD SOME PRETTY WILD TRIBAL
COUNCILS SO FAR.

880
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,996
I'M STARTING TO KIND OF HAVE A
FUNNY FEELING ABOUT THIS PLACE.

881
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,665
>> Jeff: SO, MIKE, THERE ARE

882
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,502
SIX OMETEPE, FIVE ZAPATERA,
AND MATT.

883
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,503
OBVIOUSLY, HE'S A BIG VOTE.

884
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,172
>> ABSOLUTELY.

885
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:38,881
MATT IS THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE.

886
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,841
YOU CAN SEE IT WEARING ON HIM,

887
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,550
BUT EVERYTHING'S GOING TO FALL

888
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,053
OUT HERE AT THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL

889
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:44,762
AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT
WHERE EVERYBODY STANDS.

890
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,973
>> Jeff: RALPH, WHAT DO YOU DO

891
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,350
TO TRY TO CONVINCE MATT TO COME
WITH YOU GUYS?

892
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,393
>> BE GOOD TO HIM.

893
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,018
TAKE HIM FURTHER IN THE GAME.

894
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,353
THEY DONE CANNED HIM ONCE,

895
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,688
SO THEY'LL PROBABLY DO IT AGAIN.

896
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,023
>> Jeff: MATT, FAIR ARGUMENT.

897
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,984
THESE ARE THE GUYS
THAT VOTED YOU OUT.

898
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:58,609
WHY GO BACK TO THEM?

899
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,695
>> IT'S AN EXTREMELY FAIR

900
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,321
ARGUMENT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE

901
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,532
I'VE BEEN GONE
THE PAST 15 DAYS.

902
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,158
IT'S NOT LIKE TIME STOPPED.

903
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,702
THEY CONTINUED TO GROW IN THEIR

904
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,412
RELATIONSHIPS AND GET CLOSER
TOGETHER.

905
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,621
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M ON THE BOTTOM

906
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,582
OF THE ALLIANCE HERE, AND
HONESTLY, I STILL EVEN STRUGGLED

907
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,876
TODAY WITH WHAT TO DO

908
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,837
BUT I'M STARTING TO SEE
THE WHOLE PICTURE.

909
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,216
>> Jeff: WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
A BIG VOTE

910
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,510
AND, MATT, YOU ARE
SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

911
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,761
NATALIE HAS THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE,

912
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,763
CANNOT VOTE FOR NATALIE.

913
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,389
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

914
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,516
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

915
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,226
NATALIE, YOU'RE UP.

916
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,990
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

917
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,413
IF ANYBODY
HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

918
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,665
YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

919
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,345
>> I WANT TO PLAY THIS ON MIKE.

920
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,723
>> Jeff: OKAY, GIVING THIS TO
MIKE.

921
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,685
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

922
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,271
ANY VOTES CAST AGAINST MIKE WILL
NOT COUNT.

923
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,526
ONCE THE VOTE ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

924
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,153
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

925
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,822
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

926
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,824
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

927
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,704
FIRST VOTE, GRANT.

928
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,498
GRANT.

929
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,499
TWO VOTES GRANT.

930
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:23,045
THAT'S THREE VOTES GRANT.

931
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,505
FOUR VOTES FOR GRANT.

932
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,715
FIVE VOTES FOR GRANT.

933
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,807
STEVE.

934
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,935
FIVE VOTES FOR GRANT, ONE VOTE
FOR STEVE.

935
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,483
MATT.

936
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,408
MATT.

937
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,869
TWO VOTES MATT.

938
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,579
THREE VOTES MATT.

939
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,248
MATT.

940
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,291
FOUR VOTES MATT.

941
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,337
WE'RE TIED.

942
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,549
FIVE VOTES GRANT, FIVE VOTES
MATT, ONE VOTE STEVE.

943
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,097
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR REDEMPTION ISLAND"--

944
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,473
MATT.

945
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,766
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

946
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,699
>> Jeff: MATT, ONCE AGAIN,
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

947
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,077
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

948
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:37,745
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAD BACK TO

949
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,704
REDEMPTION ISLAND WHERE ONCE

950
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,289
AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO

951
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,790
GET BACK IN THIS GAME.

952
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,423
>> WHAT THE HELL, GUYS.

953
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,093
>> Jeff: WELL, THAT IS A
"SURVIVOR" FIRST.

954
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,929
HERE'S THE PROBLEM-- MATT IS NOW

955
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,222
HEADING TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

956
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,390
WHERE AT LEAST ONE OF THE 11 OF

957
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,100
YOU WILL HAVE TO FACE HIM IN A

958
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,435
DUEL, AND I HAVE A FEELING

959
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:03,729
FORGIVENESS, NOT GOING TO BE ON
HIS MIND.

960
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,772
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

961
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,732
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
GOOD NIGHT.

962
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,328
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

963
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,250
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR": >> GRANT!

964
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,627
>> Jeff: AND ROB ARE THROUGH.
HELLO!

965
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,256
ROB CEMENTS
CONTROL OF HIS TRIBE.

966
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,633
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, OMETEPE!

967
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,926
>> Jeff: OR DOES HE?

968
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,261
>> I'M MY OWN MAN.

969
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:35,928
I MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS.

970
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,347
AND PHILLIP GETS A MAKEOVER.

971
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,807
PHILLIP, DID YOU HAVE A
COLLISION WITH A HAWK?

972
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,141
>> I ASKED FOR A SIGN,

973
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,644
AND OUT OF THIN AIR,
APPEARED THIS FEATHER.

974
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:49,817
>> WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

975
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,819
I HAVE NO IDEA.

976
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,822
I PUT MY TRUST IN GOD AND TODAY

977
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,864
GOD'S WILL WAS CONTRADICTORY

978
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,241
TO WHAT I WANTED.

979
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,534
I LIKE THESE PEOPLE.

980
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,994
I WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH THESE
PEOPLE.

981
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,496
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE
FRIENDS WITH ME.

982
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,914
AND, APPARENTLY, I'M JUST NOT

983
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,958
VERY GOOD AT THIS GAME OF
"SURVIVOR."

984
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:06,709
