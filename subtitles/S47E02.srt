<i>I need to go and read</i>

<i>I felt the scroll</i>

45
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,660

46

61
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:45,732
<i>Rome was the person</i>

63
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,373

-Like, and that's,

I should have discussed with you

90

00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,619
gone and out of my hands, but

505
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:04,790
<i>is in the hands</i>

506
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,358
RACHEL:
Let's go!

507
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,027
-There we go.
-Oh, my God.

508
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,996
There we go.
We got it.

509
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,397
<i>Finally, Rachel and I</i>

510
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,900
<i>get to the key to unlock</i>

511
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:16,001
the box.

512
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,769
Um, I'm not
feeling good right now.

513
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,970
I have to think about things.

514
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,672
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.

515
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,978
-Okay, let's talk.
-Okay.

516
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,614
<i>ANDY:</i>
<i>Sam-- he is my one foothold</i>

517
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,282
<i>to get back into this game.</i>

518
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,251
<i>And so my gut is saying</i>

519
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,086
I can trust him.

520
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,587
So, like, two hours ago,

521
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,390
I found but did not take
the Beware Advantage.

522
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,325
-You found it?
-Yeah, but I didn't take it.

523
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,827
-Oh, you left it?
-Yeah. Didn't want--

524
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,362
I didn't want to lose my vote.
So, I stashed it.

525
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,998
<i>SAM:</i>
<i>I was in musical theater,</i>
<i>and it's not for my singing.</i>

526
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,001
<i>Like, I can act a little bit,</i>
<i>but I was not ready</i>

527
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,504
for the bomb that Andy
was about to drop.

528
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,146
<i>SAM:</i>
<i>He says one of the girls found</i>

529
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,116
the Beware Advantage.
Music to my ears, Andy.

530
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,217
<i>I think you're right.</i>

531
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:06,585
<i>They're up to no good.</i>

532
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:07,919
They've got something.

533
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,521
Damn.

534
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,693
-I think it's okay.
<i>-ANDY: With Sam, I am</i>

535
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,927
<i>telling him this</i>
<i>valuable information</i>

536
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,497
in order to build
the trust I need.

537
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,599
I feel kind of bad
because I'm sitting there

538
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,701
<i>with the key in my sock.</i>

539
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,936
<i>But as silly as Andy might feel</i>

540
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,608
<i>losing a Beware Advantage,</i>
<i>he took a huge leap of faith</i>

541
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,009
coming to me
with this information.

542
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,845
-I trust you.
-Yeah, dude, I got you, 100%.

543
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,180
<i>This is starting</i>
<i>to make me feel</i>

544
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,717
like I can actually trust Andy
moving forward.

545
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,190
<i>TK: Now, obviously, us three</i>

546
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,760
and Gabe are probably set
to not be gone early.

547
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,428
Uh, so,

548
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,364
I just want to see w--
if we're really--

549
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,766
if we could gauge this out.
If we were to say right now,

550
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,469
<i>if we lose next challenge,</i>

551
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,939
who do we think
in this situation we're going?

552
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,308
It's, like,
a toss-up between, like...

553
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,442
<i>TK:</i>
<i>Sue and Caroline.</i>
<i>I just don't think Sue</i>

554
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,011
<i>brings anything to the table.</i>

555
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,384
Gabe.

556
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,920
-I'm moving slow today.
-TK: It's-it's all good.
Take your time, bro.

557
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,988
<i>GABE: TK, Kyle, and Tiyana--</i>

558
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,223
<i>I think they all think</i>
<i>I'm kind of just</i>

559
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,958
a quiet guy and I really
haven't found my place,

560
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,593
socially, with everybody.

561
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,829
We were just trying to figure
out, you know, generally...

562
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,130
GABE:
Uh-huh.

563
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:26,832
...how we were thinking
about the other two.

564
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,733
-GABE: Yeah.
-But I don't know.

565
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:34,005
Yeah. I'm down with it.

566
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:35,273
TK:
The-- This is the four, bro.

567
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,943
Yeah, yeah.
I'm totally cool with that.

568
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,645
<i>They pitched the idea to me</i>
<i>of "this is our four,"</i>

569
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,013
<i>and I think that</i>

570
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,548
they believe that
I'm in with them.

571
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,450
This is our four.
This is our four.

572
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:46,651
<i>But</i>

573
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,086
that four is not my four.

574
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,290
<i>Caroline and Sue</i>
<i>are way more attractive to me</i>

575
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,759
<i>as alliance partners</i>
<i>than the other three are.</i>

576
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,994
We need to put something
in our stomachs.

577
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,396
<i>GABE:</i>
<i>They're on the bottom right now.</i>

578
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:01,766
<i>These are wounded birds,</i>
<i>and I want</i>

579
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,202
<i>to bring these birds in,</i>
<i>'cause people who feel like</i>

580
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,670
they're on the bottom--
they're desperate.

581
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,040
<i>Me and Sue are pretty locked in</i>
<i>as number ones.</i>

582
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,242
<i>So, the next</i>

583
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,109
wounded bird
I need to go get is Caroline.

584
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,646
I think TK and Kyle
are way closer with each other

585
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,580
than either of them
are with me,

586
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,450
and the only person
I've talked any s--

587
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,652
real strategy with is Sue.

588
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,053
I feel like
you're a genuine person.

589
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,388
I really want to work with you.

590
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,890
You, me and Sue--

591
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:27,459
-we can run this thing.
-Okay.

592
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,427
<i>I have zero</i>
<i>working relationship with Gabe.</i>

593
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,963
<i>I just graduated</i>
<i>from business school.</i>

594
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,300
<i>I'm not an idiot. I don't</i>
<i>believe him for a second.</i>

595
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,336
So, I have no trust
in him whatsoever.

596
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,205
I want to work with you.

597
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,773
-Mm-hmm.
-We have a lot of potential.

598
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,875
-Uh-huh. Yeah.
-It's not here yet.

599
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,477
But I don't feel like
I have that thing

600
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:48,213
where I can, like...
I don't know.

601
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,314
It's just not clicking

602
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,016
-Yeah.
-as much as I want it to.

603
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,419
<i>GABE:</i>
<i>I'm surprised by just</i>
<i>how skeptical Caroline is of me.</i>

604
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,289
And I know I have to squash
that as soon as I possibly can.

605
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,823
So,

606
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,025
<i>at that moment,</i>
<i>I make the call</i>

607
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,526

00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,561
(mutters)

609
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,763
Yeah, that's it.

610
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,133
<i>And then he shows me</i>

611
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,401
his idol.

612
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,069
Hey, good job.

613
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,704
-It's huge.
-Thank you.

614
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,638
<i>CARLOLINE:</i>
<i>This is such a weird</i>
<i>show of trust.</i>

615
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,241
<i>So, I actually think</i>

616
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,010
maybe there's a world where
Gabe and I can work together.

617
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,744
-He told me he has it.
-Yeah?

618
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:22,380
-He has the idol.
-Okay.

619
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:25,016
-He told me, too. Okay.
-Oh, my God.

620
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,519
-Okay, okay, okay.
-So...

621
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,787
-Interesting.
-Yeah.

622
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,555
I want to be cautious,

623
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,690
but I'm optimistic.

624
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,692
But I-I definitely
think we're good.

625
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,727
I mean, I think
as long as me, you and Gabe

626
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,463
can stay strong,
we're gonna be okay.

647
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,076

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,888
we needed to take, like,
an hour or so nap on the beach.

653
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:39,924
It's much more comfortable
than our bamboo.

654
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,129
The reason I don't like Florida,
to be honest with you, bro,

655

is there's too much wildlife out

657

-Aw...
-I just-- Godzilla comes
out the bush, bro.

Like, the biggest alligator

Ready? It's heavy.

839
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:04,661

You guys are great.

877
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,580
PROBST:
You're doing this blind.

878
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,148
You're trying to find the hole

879
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,551
and then get the key
through hole.

880
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:34,986
KYLE:
Make a grid with your mind.

881
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,754
PROBST:
You don't know
if you're making progress

882
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,556

883
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,056

Good job, Rome.

885
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,395
PROBST:
You'll know

886
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:50,067

00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,451
Tiyana feeling the pressure.

00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,065
-Yeah, baby. Go!
-(whooping)

900
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:24,869
-Tear it open.
-SIERRA: Rip it
like that coconut.

901
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,071
PROBST:
Andy now looking for that ball.

902
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,940
-Rome has it for Lavo!
-Yes!

903
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:34,779
He can unlock that door. It's
now Tiyana who's gonna feel it.

904
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,349
-Yes!
-Andy has the ball.

905
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,084
It is Gata in the lead,

906
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,453
something they are definitely
not used to.

907
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,222
-Oh, yeah, baby. Yeah.
-GENEVIEVE: I don't know what

908
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,657
that means, but it sounds great.

909
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,159
-Ah! Ah!
-(whooping)

910
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,760
-PROBST: Rome has the door open.
-Come on!

911
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,895

912
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,931
PROBST:

Come on, Tiyana!

914
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,835
-SIERRA: Don't stress.
-SAM: All right.

915
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,402
-We ready?
-PROBST: Sierra, Sam and Anika.

916
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:02,973
And this will take a lot
of teamwork

917
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,842
and a lot of communication.

918
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,011
It's a very delicate move
you're trying to make

919
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:11,215
as you guide that ball
along this winding track.

920
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,285
There is a massive
learning curve to this challenge

921
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,822
because it requires all
three players to work together.

922
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,125
There are a lot of bogeys.

923
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,428
Those holes
you've got to get around.

924
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,864
Don't overdo it there.
We want it to stop right here.

925
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,666
PROBST:

He's got it.

927
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,637
Yes.

928
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,440
Tiyana finally has the key
for Tuku.

929
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,878
Tuku is through.

930
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,514
-Let's go, guys!

933
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,288
ANIKA:
We're learning.

934
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,857
I want to eat this.

935
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:54,692
Yeah, me, too.
I was just thinking.

936
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,462
PROBST:
Kyle looking for that ball now.
He's got it.

937
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,166
Gonna be TK,
Gabe and Kyle for Tuku.

938
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,501
AYSHA:
You got this, Lavo!

939
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,904
PROBST:
Lavo drops.
They got to start over.

940
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,672
-Let's go on the other side.
-GENEVIEVE: Yeah.

941
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,741
It is a blistering hot day.

942
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,710
You're already exhausted.

943
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,713
But it comes down to this--
one little ball,

944
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,616
a windy little path,

945
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:21,752
and victory
awaiting you at the end.

946
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,721
It is Gata in the lead.

947
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,089
Keep it taut.

948
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,657
PROBST:
But Tuku is now catching Gata.

949
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,160
I'm going pressure, you're
giving finesse right now.

950
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,161
Nice guide, bro. Nice guide.
We got it. Easy work.

951
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,663
PROBST:
A little tension,
a little slack.

952
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,331
You need more, I give you some.

953
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,100
I need some, you got to let go.

954
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,368
Guide it at your pace.

955
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,768
-You're good.
-SIERRA: Am I giving slack?

956
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:40,237
Yeah. Yup. Stop when we get
right before the hole.

957
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,772
ANIKA:
Stopping.

958
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,108
Sierra, you're calling out
which one's thicker.

959
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,210
SIERRA:
Well, my side. Wait. No.

960
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,978
-Left side, left side.
-SAM: Anika's side, okay.

961
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,613
So both of you pull,
get it to the end.

962
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,248
-Let me get this
to the edge.
-ANIKA: Yup.

963
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,551
When you figure out
how to work together on this,

964
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,820
it becomes very easy.

965
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,221
SAM:
Keep going, Si.

966
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,756
PROBST:
Lavo moving very slowly now,

967
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,758

from their mistakes.

968
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,526
-GENEVIEVE: Okay?
-ROME: We're good,
we're good, we're good.

969
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,762
But we are absolutely
neck-and-neck now

970
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:09,600
with Gata and Tuku
at the same spot, same obstacle.

971
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,035
-Little bit more, Gabe.
Give it a little bit.
-Yup, yup.

972
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,737
-Stop, stop, stop, stop!
-PROBST: Tuku can't navigate it.

973
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,473
That's how fast
this challenge can change.

974
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,510
-Somebody pull. Watch it.
-PROBST: It is Gata in the lead.

975
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,911
-I'm pulling as much as I can.
-Calm down.

976
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,547
Stop! Hey, stop! All right?

977
00:41:24,614 --> 00:41:26,317
-What are we doing? Let's go.
-PROBST: Gata starting to panic.

978
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,085
ANIKA:
Okay, well, I mean,
I can't pull.

979
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,354
Choke up on the rope.
You have more rope.

980
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,523
Sam, Sam, if I pull it
any further, it won't go.

981
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,991
-Please listen to me.
-SAM: All right. All right.

982
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,427
PROBST:
Tuku moving quickly now,

983
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,929
trying to catch Lavo.
They can feel the pressure,

984
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,533
but somebody's gonna be last.
Somebody's going to Tribal.

985
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,201
-Slack, lot of it.
-PROBST: Gata is very close

986
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,536
to finishing this challenge.

987
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,972
There is one spot left.

988
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,108
-No!
-I can't pull anymore.

989
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,343
PROBST:
Gata at the last spot.

990
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,478
One hole. Can they get past it

991
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,679
and drop for the win?

992
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:56,947
SAM:
Yeah. Watch it. Watch it.

993
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,382
PROBST:
Very close.

994
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,185
-Oh, my God.
-We're good. Stop. Stop.

995
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,523
And they got it!
Gata wins immunity!

996
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,893
Safe from Tribal Council.
We're looking for one more.

997
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,998
And right now, it is Lavo
decidedly ahead of Tuku.

998
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,299
-Keep the ring left.
-PROBST: They have got to move

999
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,101

I mean, obviously we lost,

1056

so we got to stay positive and
figure something out, you know?

1057
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,540
So, it's tough.

1058
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,575
TK, now you enter the last part
of the game,

1059
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,010
the biggest part of the game,

1060
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,678
when you go to Tribal,
and you vote somebody out.

1061
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,481
You haven't had
to deal with that yet.

1062
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:46,083
Can you anticipate
what's gonna be different

1063
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,085
as you head back to camp?

1064
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:51,355
Uh, I mean, honestly, I'm
genuinely pissed off right now,

1065
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,056
so it's hard for me to even
think that far right now.

1066
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,893
I'm just... We got way too many
smiles over here for us to lose.

1067
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,295
I'm just not used to losing.
I don't hang

1068
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,330
with people who are cool
with losing. I don't...

1069
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,366
I don't even associate myself
with that.

1070
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,835
If I lose,
I'm not gonna be happy about it.

1071
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,503
And, uh, I just want
to make sure

1072
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,505
that I have a tribe
that has the same mindset,

1073
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,507
and if we don't,
then that's a problem.

1074
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,877
All right, Tuku,
Tribal Council tonight,

1075
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,713

And as a penalty for losing--
sorry for you--

1078
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,485
I'm gonna take your flint.

1079
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,922
Thank you.

00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,893
-please come to me
and talk to me about it.
-Mm-hmm.

1162
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,431
Like, I don't need you going
around the circle to tell me,

1163
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,065
like, that you feel
a certain type of way.

1164
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,434
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Talk to me about it.

1165
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:58,869
At the end of the day,
I didn't even

1166
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:01,405
see who smiled on the tribe,
so nothing was pointed

1167
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,340
at you, him, anybody.

1168
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,876
Jeff said, "Damn, Tuku.
You guys are smiling.

1169
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,277
You're going to Tribal tonight."

1170
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,645
-And that's what triggered you?
-And I said,

1171
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,847
"I'm not comfortable
with anybody smiling right now."

1172
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,716
But that being said,
are we straight?

1173
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,484
-Uh, yes.
-All right.

1174
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,087
<i>TIYANA:</i>
<i>When I came out here,</i>
<i>I knew that I wanted to be</i>

1175
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,856
a player that separated emotion
from gameplay.

1176
00:49:19,922 --> 00:49:22,159
I could not like you,
but I could work with you.

1177
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:25,027
And I'm...
and then, I'm just like, "No."

1178
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:27,497
<i>TIYANA:</i>
<i>But it's very, very difficult</i>
<i>because right now,</i>

1179
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,867
<i>I'm getting a little bit annoyed</i>
<i>at TK with his ego.</i>

1180
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,070
<i>However, strategically,</i>

1181
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,973
<i>he is a great physical asset</i>
<i>to have in these challenges.</i>

1182
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,277
<i>And I know that I have to</i>
<i>sometimes put the emotions aside</i>

1183
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:41,844
if I want
to get farther in the game.

1184
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:43,413
-I just want to make sure
we're all good.
-KYLE: All right.

1185
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,581
-Yup. No. Ser...
-Love you. Love you.

1186
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,782
-We're straight. We're solid.
-So...

1187
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,918
We're gonna
stick to the same plan.

1188
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,020
Sue: done.

1189
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,955
<i>TIYANA:</i>
<i>I do believe that Sue,</i>
<i>right now,</i>

1190
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,857
<i>is one of the weaker members</i>
<i>of the tribe</i>

1191
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,292
<i>because she can't</i>
<i>really contribute</i>

1192
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,827
<i>to physical challenges,</i>

1193
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,763
<i>and it kind of seems like</i>
<i>she's fizzling out on day five.</i>

1194
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,832
-I'm good for it.
-TK: I think we stick with Sue.

1195
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,533
-So we stick with Sue? I'm game.
-And that'd be the end of it.

1196
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,902
<i>TK:</i>
<i>Sue needs to go home.</i>

1197
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,804
<i>It's not a hard decision</i>
<i>because Sue doesn't really</i>

1198
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,606
<i>bring anything</i>
<i>specifically to the tribe.</i>

1199
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:10,974
<i>So,</i>

1200
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,110
think my game plan
is working flawlessly right now.

1201
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,678
I think that's
the only way we can play.

1202
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:18,014
<i>Myself, Tiyana and Kyle--</i>
<i>locked in.</i>

1203
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,850

1204
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,284
<i>So, the way that I'm moving</i>

1205
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,585
these chess pieces around,

1206
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,286
everybody else
is playing checkers right now.

1207
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:33,697
<i>GABE:</i>
<i>I think T is cool with us.</i>

1208
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,699
I think T will go Sue
if we want her to go Sue.

1209
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,367
-I think she would.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-You know?

1210
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,136
I think Caroline and Sue...

1211
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,737
-No, no, no.
-TK: You know?

1212
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,840
I feel like T is almost more
like bro than...

1213
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,942
With us. Yeah, exactly.
Yeah. No, totally, totally.

1214
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:47,511
-All right, so...
-GABE: I...

1215
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:49,946
I think we just go four on Sue.

1216
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,416
<i>TK thinks that</i>
<i>it's the three guys plus Tiyana.</i>

1217
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,084
<i>That's what I need to happen.</i>

1218
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:58,054
I need him to think,
"Before we go to Tribal Council,

1219
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,090
"let me get Gabe in
'cause he's our fourth vote

1220
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,858
"and he's just happy to do

1221
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,193
<i>whatever we say anyway."</i>

1222
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,963
I think we do that
and, uh, call it a day.

1223
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,600
<i>GABE:</i>
<i>So, TK feels extremely secure</i>
<i>right now,</i>

1224
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,402
which will make this
quite a blindside.

1225
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,670
If we can pull it off.

1226
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:29,119
I'm praying to God you do not
need to play your idol tonight.

1227
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,754
I could play the idol for Sue,

1228
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:33,290
<i>but the thing with Tiyana</i>
<i>has changed things a lot.</i>

1229
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,794
-This is... Yeah. She's four.
-Okay. Yeah.

1230
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,363
Yes. 100%.

1231
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,235
<i>And I think if we can lock</i>
<i>Tiyana in as a fourth right now,</i>

1232
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,871
<i>I don't see any reason</i>
<i>to use my idol tonight.</i>

1233
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,639
I will have
a ... conversation with her.

1234
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,873

1235
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,742
You don't know I... Yeah.

1236
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,110

1237
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,911
-Whatever you got to say
to make it happen.
-Okay.

1238
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:59,082

Yeah, even if it's a tie.

1249
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,975

to put Tiyana,

1250

to ... change her vote.

1255
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,222

Behind each of you is a torch.

Go ahead and grab a torch,
dip it in and get fire.

1302

This is part of the ritual

Sue, did you see
any natural pairing?

1309
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:19,783
It often happens when you have
a group of strangers

1310
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,485
that you say, "Oh, I'm from
that part of the country"

or "I'm the mom, too."

was a bromance developing,

1313

from the very beginning,

1314
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,096
there were, like, the three guys

on the bottom.

It seemed like
they vibed really well.

1320
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,573
But also, this is<i> Survivor.</i>

1321
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,843
Nothing's ever so cookie-cutter.
"Oh, boys and girls."

1322
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,145
-Right.
-So, I really do think

1323
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,147
that what once started
as a bromance

1324
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:54,217
maybe possibly could be split.
We never know.

1325
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,685
PROBST:
So, let me just check
with the three guys.

1326
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,088
Do you agree with that?
Did you all feel like

1327
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:00,056
-you just bonded quickly?
-Oh, yeah.

1328
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:03,893
-I mean...
-I... I bonded pretty quickly
with them.

1329
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,862
but I also bonded
with some girls, as well.

1330
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,765
I'm not strictly on a bromance
or a romance or nothing.

1331
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:11,301
PROBST:
TK, one thing Sue said

1332
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,070
very clearly was,
the men were on top,

1333
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,272
and the women were
on the bottom. She didn't say

1334
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:17,873
it was even in her view.

1335
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,642
TK:
I think what a lot of that had

1336
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,878
to do with is maybe she wasn't
as comfortable initiating

1337
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,179
conversation like the guys were.

1338
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,181
If you're kind of just
in your own bubble,

1339
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:27,584
that can make you feel that way.

1340
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,486
So, Sue, that's
very much your problem.

1341
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,755
That's not my problem
whatsoever.

1342
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:36,226
I can socialize and be very good
with men as well as women.

1343
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,861
There was a line,
and you could tell,

1344
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:39,896
you know,
they wanted to stay strong.

1345
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,564
TK:
I just got a question.

1346
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:45,835
Has anybody really talked to Sue
more than two or three times

1347
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,871
as far as, like,
deep conversation?

1348
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,806
-Have you?
-I've tried. I mean,

1349
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:51,407
we've tried to have
conversations. I'm just saying.

1350
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,409
I'm just asking the question,
like, how much did you actually

1351
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,844
initiate conversation
with everyone else?

1352
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:57,847
That's the things that
you have to do on<i> Survivor,</i>

1353
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,882
is you have
to have those conversations.

1354
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,216
And if you're not,

1355
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,818
we all know
by watching the game,

1356
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:02,986
things can change.

1357
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:07,891
Gabe, it can't
surprise you that, already,

1358
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,593
there's this division
or misunderstanding

1359
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,195
or whatever
it might ultimately be.

1360
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,197
That's part of the design
of this game.

1361
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,834
You take a group of strangers
and you thrust them into crisis

1362
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,769
and say, "Figure it out."

1363
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,771
Yeah. I think that
in the game of<i> Survivor,</i>

1364
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,307
there's two kinds of
relationships you have, right?

1365
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,809
There are your
strategic relationships

1366
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,210
and there are
your social relationships.

1367
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,646
And I think that people,
especially in early days,

1368
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:33,716
they see social relationships,
and they immediately

1369
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,485
associate them
with strategic relationships.

1370
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,655
But those two things
aren't always the same thing.

1371
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:43,960
PROBST:
Caroline, is there
a stated philosophy

1372
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,428
with this tribe when it comes

1373
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:48,164
to searching
for idols or advantages?

1374
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,967
There's really only one person
I can think of who is known

1375
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,570
as the person for, like,
you can tell what they're doing.

1376
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,738
-So...
-PROBST: You're all smiling.

1377
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,207
Do you know
who Caroline's talking about?

1378
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,242
-Yeah.
-Yes.
-PROBST: Who is it?

1379
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,744
-Gabe.
-Ooh.

1380
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,781
So, Gabe, is this a surprise
that they are onto you?

1381
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,182
GABE:
I mean, look,

1382
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:09,118
the game says, "Here's
an island, and it's yours."

1383
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:12,188
And this is an opportunity
to be a kid again.

1384
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,257
And I like to Tarzan around
a little bit, and,

1385
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,625
you know,
I'm not blind to the fact

1386
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,627
that that's gonna
raise eyebrows,

1387
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,529
but I want to be Indiana Jones
for a little bit.

1388
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,598
Let me be Indiana Jones.
Come on.

1389
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:25,235
PROBST:
Gabe, your enthusiasm for that,

1390
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:28,137
to me, is the hallmark
of a new era player.

1391
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,407
You all tend to wear your hearts
on your sleeves.

1392
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:32,809
You're more passionate.

1393
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,911
We had it with you today, TK.

1394
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:38,181
It was different. You were
frustrated about the challenge.

1395
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,083
So, did you have an intention

1396
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:43,186
when you said, "I want people
to know I'm not happy"?

1397
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:46,422
Absolutely. I think the whole
goal of me even speaking out

1398
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,491
wasn't to single any one person
out on the tribe,

1399
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:49,893
but more to get
everybody's attention

1400
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,294
to reinforce the fact

1401
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,896
that we should not
be okay with losing.

1402
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,831
And we need to understand that
we want to win,

1403
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,299
we need to go as hard
as we can go

1404
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,301
and not be happy
with being last place

1405
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,503
and not be complacent
with being last place,

1406
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,472
especially for the fact that
somebody's going home tonight

1407
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:05,174
because we didn't win.

1408
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,043
(thunder rumbles)

1409
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,281
PROBST:
So, Tiyana, tonight's vote

1410
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,449
is the first test of trust.

1411
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:16,886
Did you find yourself needing
a little more reassurance?

1412
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,888
TIYANA:
Oh, absolutely.
And kind of going back

1413
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,891
to balancing
social and strategic,

1414
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,893
it's like,
"Oh, do I like this person

1415
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,896
"and I kind of trust them
for them just being themselves,

1416
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:29,098
"or do I trust them
on a strategy level

1417
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,100
of, like, playing
this game with me?"

1418
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:34,804
So, at this point, I'm like, how
will the chips fall? You know?

1419
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,273
So, moving forward in this game,

1420
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,476
I need to work with people
that I can genuinely trust.

1421
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:44,080
But also, you never
actually know who you can trust

1422
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:46,649
until whoever's
torch is getting snuffed

1423
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,518
is getting snuffed.

1424
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:53,356
And on that note,
it is time to vote.

1425
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,758
