it starts a timer.

133

And so, I run like I'm doing

134
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:23,275
a little airplane down the beach

135
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,931
so that my tribe buys

136
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:27,620
that Hunter's just excited about
this "Drop your Buffs thing."

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,620
HUNTER:
But in reality, a few days ago,

138
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:32,413
I found the Beware Advantage.

139
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:35,000
It says you have to wait
until either you lose

140
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:36,689
or you drop your Buffs
to get a clue

141
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,241

to get the idol.

143
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,206
Then I have to run back
to the place where I found

144
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,000
this Beware Advantage
to begin with,

145
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,172
dig it up and follow whatever
instructions it has for me

146
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,931
before the new Tribemates
show up.

147
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,620
And so, this unknown timer

148
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:51,413
just automatically
starts counting down.

149
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:52,931
Okay.

150
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,034
Okay. It's got
to be some of the steps.

00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:06,827
Maybe the steps
in front of camp.

152
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:08,379

"This step
won't lead you astray."

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,724
I've got people behind me

179
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,137
probably gonna
come down the steps.

180
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,137
I'm looking for a boat
to come on the horizon.

181
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,482
I mean, realistically,
we used to talk all the time

182
00:08:57,586 --> 00:08:58,793
in the beginning,
and now you barely talk to me.

183
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,137
And that's just a real...
that's, like...

184
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:01,620
I'm not blind, so, like,
that's just reality.

185
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,896
SODA: I feel like we have
not so much to talk about

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,379
because Nami
keeps winning, and...

187
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:06,827
But we need
to talk to each other.

188
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,862
Like, it doesn't have
to be strategy all the time.

189
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,068
HUNTER:
If those boats show up,

190
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:11,689
the time
to find the idol is done.

191
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:15,413
So, there is definitely
a ticking time bomb.

192
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:27,206
I don't just have
to find this thing.

193
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,689
I'm not looking for the idol.

194
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:31,724
I'm looking for the key
that gets me to my box

195
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:33,724
that opens it
and then I get the idol.

196
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:36,655
And so, there's so much to do
and so little time

197
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:38,310
and so many pressures,
and you're just like,

198
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:39,793
"Oh, my goodness.

199
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,413
I've got to get moving
with this."

200
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, golly.

00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,344
Hey, Hunter.

202
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:53,689
Come on, Liz.

203
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,068
And so, I finally
get the key out,

204
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,344
and then here comes Liz,

205
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:57,965
almost instantly, to talk to me.

206
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:01,068
I think I left a sling
out by the boat...

207
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:02,724
'cause I was excited.

208
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:04,068
I'll go get it for you.

209
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:05,862
I think I left my other one
out there, too.

210
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:08,689
I don't think
she sees anything, and so,

211
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:10,206
I hightail it to where
I've hidden this thing.

Oh, my God.

216
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:34,655
I finally open the box.

217
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,965
There it is-- a full-blown idol
sitting in this box

218
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:39,413
for me to use that nobody...

219
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,482
knows about.

220
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,482
That was way too stressful.

221
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,689
This is also
really important because

222
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:48,103
I lost my vote
on the last journey.

223
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:50,206

all around this island.

the foundation

307
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:45,448

made an alliance at the journey,

314
00:14:56,931 --> 00:15:00,344
and we all got the opportunity
to pull in one person

315
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,896
who we all must protect.

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,448

319
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,310
So today, the journey six

320
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:12,448
is what I want to try
to make sure is intact.

321
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,655
-Yeah?
-I'm more so...

322
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:18,103
I'm just unsure about Tim

323
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:19,586
because he has so many options
over there,

324
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:21,344
'cause they do seem like
they're all getting along.

325

But Hunter and I--
we still are a little

326
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,448
wary about Tim and Maria

327
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,172
on whether or not
they're on board.

328
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,655
We have to make sure
that the six is solid.

329
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:32,068
Yeah.

330
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,482
Q: So, my next talk needs
to be Maria

331
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,586
because I wanted to figure out,
has Tim done his part?

332
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,275
Did Tim talk to you
after the journey?

333
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,586
Tim talked to me
after the journey.

334
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:44,034
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah.

335
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:46,517
I mean, we-we kind of all do
everything together.

336
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,827
I don't know
if you've heard that.

337
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,275
-Yeah, he told us. Um...
-We...

338
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,620
We sit down and talk
about everything,

339
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:52,034
and everyone knows
everything, and...

340
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:55,827
Now, Tim and I and Hunter--
we was talking,

341
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:59,275
and Tim was telling us
you're his guy.

342
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,068
-Oh, really?
-Um, well, when I say "guy,"

343
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:03,517
-like, that's the... that...
-I'm his person?

344
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,413
-Yeah, that's the person.
-MARIA: Evidently, Tim told Q

345
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:09,068
on their journey that
Tim and I were really close.

346
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:11,000
And I was like,
"Huh? Like, what about Ben?

347
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,827
Like, I thought
Ben was your number one."

348
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,172
Like, I thought
it was very strange.

349
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,310
You know,
Charlie is my number one,

350
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:19,000
and Tim and I have
a connection,

351
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,724
but by no means would I have
put him top on my list.

352
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,482
Like, he might have been
number three.

353
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,241
You know, everybody
has their person

354
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:28,586
-in, like, different ways.
-Q: Out of the gate,

355
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:31,103
Maria didn't seem too filled in

356
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:32,724
on the six,

357
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,965
so I wanted to figure out
what Tim actually told her

358
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,482
from our journey.

359
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:38,517
If Tim did not fill Maria in
on the six,

360
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,172
I know now
Tim is not to be trusted.

361
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,000
And the other thing...

362
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:46,586
Q: I-I didn't...

363
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:52,275
TIM: No, I just think...

364
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,931
She a connection type person,
so anything, like...

365
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:57,827
She gonna feel you out
even if I tell her or not,

366
00:16:57,931 --> 00:16:59,172
you know, so I just like...

367
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:00,655
I like that y'all
was already talking.

368
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:01,896
I want to work
with the group of six.

369
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,378
I think they're strong, I think

370
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:08,034
they have a good likelihood
to go far in the merge.

371
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:10,792
I've also seen
people commit too early

372
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,413
in past seasons
ofSurvivor, so,

373
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,517
I'm exploring, I'm observing.

374
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,275
No solid game plans,

375
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:19,862
but I'm not
saying nothing too soon.

376
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:23,655
I'll secure it before nightfall.

377
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:25,482
I'll tell her the loop.

378
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:30,620
Q:
I'm so confused as to why
Tim didn't tell Maria.

379
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:34,896
Maybe he's trying to keep
this Siga thing intact, but

380
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
it got me worried now.
It got me worried.

381
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,034
♪ ♪

382
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:06,241
-TIM: Yeah, yeah.
-MORIAH: Oh, yeah.

383
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:08,103
-MORIAH: What are your takes?
-My takes are that...

384
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:13,275
You know,
you're not letting much...

385
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:15,344
VENUS:
You know, it's a new stage
in the game,

386
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:17,931
and I'm so excited
to start making big moves.

387
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:19,758
It's been 12 days
of just camping,

388
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:21,241
and I didn't come here to camp.

389
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:23,724
I came here
to play the game, so,

390
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:26,551
I need to see where Siga stands
and where those cracks lie.

391
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,275
TIM:
You know, everybody agrees
to that before a merge.

392
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,793
It's like,
"We're gonna be Siga..."

393
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,965
-TIM: Right.
-Yeah, I mean, we're...

394
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:41,482
We're entering, like,
a different st...

395
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:45,965
-Yeah.
-Numbers will give...

396
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,310
VENUS:
These tribal lines--

397
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:48,620
they're gonna have
to dissolve.

398
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:49,827
So, I said,

399
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:51,965
"I believe
in a name for a name, and

400
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:53,620
"if you're willing
to give me Siga, I'm willing

401
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:55,068
to give you one
of my Nami members."

402
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:57,068
I feel like all of us might want
to say something,

403
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:58,655
but no one wants to talk first.

404
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:00,482
Oh, I'm always gonna listen

405
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,103
and watch the group

406
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:04,034
before I can, like,
make a decision

407
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:06,068
-on how I feel about anything.
-MORIAH: Yeah.

408
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:07,896
Like, I've been trying here
'cause it's important,

409
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,724
but, like, to be honest,
it's overwhelming for me.

410
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:14,103
Me too. Okay.

411
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:15,586
We're, like,
the exact same person.

412
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:19,206
They didn't really give me
an answer, but Moriah--

413
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,241
I have a connection with her.
I feel like I can trust her.

414
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:22,758
I feel like she's a sweet girl,

415
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,655
and I think
she'll come around to it.

416
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:28,379
So, now that I've planted seeds,
I want to see what comes up.

417
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:31,068
I have power in this game, too,
and if you don't see that now,

418
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:33,862
you will see it very soon.
[chuckles]

419
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:38,862
CHARLIE:
These rays are nice,
coming through the clouds.

420
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:42,241
This is a trippy view.

421
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:45,517
MORIAH:
Clearly, the crack in Nami

422
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,758
is Venus, and it sounds like

423
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,620
there might be wiggle room
to get a Nami out.

424
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,068
But at the same time,

425
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:55,896
Venus is clearly
a strong social player.

426
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,758
She is aggressive
with her strategy, she is smart,

427
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,551
she is thinking.

428
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:03,482
So she's not someone
I necessarily want to work with.

429
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,000
She's crafty.

430
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,000
-What about you?
-Um,

431
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:12,000
Venus approached Tim and me
with strategy talk.

432
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:14,586
MORIAH:
She just said, "Yeah, like,

433
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,724
"I'd be interested
in a name for a name."

434
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:20,896
Like, Tim and I tell her
the cracks on Siga

435
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,379
and she tells us
the cracks on Nami.

436
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:24,793
Okay.

437
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:26,413
Venus is playing
a really hard game.

438
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,862
Everyone can see that.

439
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:30,758
She's wicked smart,
as we say in Boston.

440
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,655
She's got a good mind
for the game,

441
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:35,000
and she could be a threat to me.

442
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:36,517
I did a quick check-in with Mo.

443
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,689
Sounds like Venus was
hitting you guys pretty hard.

444
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,068
-TIM: Oh, yeah, yeah.
-CHARLES: Yeah, yeah.

445
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:42,482
-TIM: She came with it.
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

446
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:43,586
I'm not worried
about it, though.

447
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:44,758
I'm not entertaining that

448
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:46,689
'cause Venus
is giving it too hard.

449
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:49,655
She said "name for name."
You know what I'm saying? She...

450
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:51,172
And you guys
didn't give one yet?

451
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:53,379
No, I said, "I get it.
I totally understand.

452
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:55,000
You know, I'll think about it."

453
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:57,344
We're clearly
playing the game now,

454
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:59,034
but I'm not worried.

455
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:01,620
I'm in a better position
than I thought I'd be

456
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:04,931
because I have both Siga and

457
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:07,172
the, uh, plus-one alliance.

458
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:09,275
But Q is asking Maria,

459
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:10,793
"Hey, have you talked to Tim?"

460
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:14,413
So, I got to talk to her
one-on-one about

461
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:15,689
the plus-one alliance.

462
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:24,689
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like, looking out...

463
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,310
That's what Q put out first,

464
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,896
and...
Hunter and I confirmed it.

465
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,586
Like, yeah,
these are the people we trust.

466
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,000
-Okay. Okay.
-And we agreed that

467
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:33,448
we'll look out
for each other's name.

468
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,275
So at the end of the day,

469
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:38,172
us six are potentially voting
the same way.

470
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:41,413
I didn't tell Maria
immediately because

471
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:44,379
I wanted Maria
to make her thoughts

472
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:45,827
or her own feelings

473
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,379
about the group of six.

474
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:48,862
And at the end of the day,

475
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:50,689
she agreed it was a strong six.

476
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:52,034
I'm down for it.
You know, like...

477
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:53,689
-You're down for it?
-Yeah, I'm down...

478
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,413
I don't want to put that on you
'cause I know we didn't...

479
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:57,103
No. Like, I was surprised 'cause
you and I didn't talk about it.

480
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:58,310
-Yeah.
-I was like, "Oh, okay."

481
00:21:58,413 --> 00:21:59,586
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-You know, like...

482
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,034
If there's a group of six,

483
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:02,620
I'm down for it because

484
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:04,172
it's nice to have options.

485
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:06,482
But the question is
does it work for me?

486
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:07,896
Because

487
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,482
I'm not here
to play Tim's game.

488
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:11,137
I'm here to play my game.

489
00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:24,586
I'll take them anywhere.
The pool in the neighborhood.

490
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,758
That's what I go for. I can eat
a whole bag of those things.

491
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:38,275
Q: Listening
to the Siga players now,

492
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,448
it's really not much
about strategy

493
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,379
or who they want to work with.

494
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:44,482
They're playing a more

495
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:46,448
cards-to-your-chest
type of game.

496
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:48,655
So, I want to make sure
I get out there,

497
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:50,586
have the right conversations

498
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:53,034
so I can start to piece together
the puzzle.

499
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:56,068
I-I bet it was crazy when
y'all got back on the beach.

500
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:57,551
Everybody skedaddled.

501
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:59,793
It really was.

502
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:03,241
I mean, there's that moment of,
like, "Do we open a coconut?

503
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:04,689
Like, anyone hungry?"

504
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:06,482
-It was unanimous, huh?
-Yeah.

505
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,172
Other than my own tribe,
no one knows

506
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:11,689
that I'm potentially
the crack in Siga

507
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:14,344
because I was the one left out
at the last Siga vote.

508
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:17,965
But right now,
the general consensus is

509
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:20,896
that we need to stay united, so,

510
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,413
I'm putting on this face that
we unanimously voted out Jem.

511
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:26,172
Did she know
she was going home or...

512
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:27,758
She didn't use
her Shot in the Dark,

513
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:29,103
so we just assumed,
I guess not.

514
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:30,517
Whose name did she write down?

515
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,620
Um, she wrote down...
I think she wrote down Ben.

516
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:35,344
-That's crazy.
-Yeah.

517
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,068
MORIAH:
Out of all the conversations
I've had,

518
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:38,758
I felt like Q is almost, like,

519
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:40,275
hitting me the hardest.

520
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:43,000
And that tells me
he's looking for these cracks

521
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:45,413
in a way that other people

522
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:47,482
might not be, so,

523
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:50,551
there's a little bit
of trepidation there.

524
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:52,482
Survivoris, like,
so complicated.

525
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:53,965
It's one of those, like...

526
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,586
I don't think there's
a whiteboard big enough

527
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:57,137
-in the world to, like,
draw everything.
-Correct.

528
00:23:58,793 --> 00:24:01,137
Me? I started, like,
with Aubry.

529
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,689
I think that she came out here

530
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:04,034
and was just, like,
authentically herself.

531
00:24:04,137 --> 00:24:05,655
-That's it.
-And, like,

532
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,000
Aubry was really
the person that...

533
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:08,448
It... [coughs] got me hooked.

534
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,413
Like, she's my, like,
OG, for like, watching,

535
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,413
-like, the 30s and everything.
-Yup.

536
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:16,241
Mo seems like a nice person,

537
00:24:16,344 --> 00:24:18,034
but I'm scared of her.

538
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:19,413
Where's everybody else?
At the beach?

539
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:21,413
At the beach, but I was, like...

540
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:25,034
-Is she?
-Ooh.

541
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:26,827
Yeah.

542
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:33,965
Mo is just aSurvivor fanatic

543
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:36,551
that can talk, talk, talk
this game.

544
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:39,344
And for you to say Aubry
is your favorite player--

545
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:42,517
that is dangerous,
because Aubry

546
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,689
was setting up people
left and right.

547
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:48,413
And if Mo thinks
she's gonna set me up,

548
00:24:48,517 --> 00:24:50,379
Mo can cancel Christmas.

549
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:52,241
It ain't happening.

550
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:14,655
Come on in.

551
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,931
-CHARLIE: Oh, my...
-PROBST: Look at this.

552
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:36,103
You're gonna need
everything you've got

553
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:38,551
in the tank today.

554
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:40,827
-[weak chuckle]
-Oh...
-SODA: Crazy.

555
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,137
All right.
Shall we get to it?

556
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,931
-[all voicing assent]
-First things first.

557
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,689
Got to take back the idols.
Thank you, Hunter.

558
00:25:48,793 --> 00:25:50,931
-TEVIN: Okay.
-SODA: My God.

559
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:52,965
-Thanks, Kenzie.
-Yeah. No problem.

560
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,344
-This is gonna be crazy.
-[indistinct chatter]

561
00:25:55,448 --> 00:25:57,310
Tribal immunity...

562
00:25:57,413 --> 00:25:58,517
no more.

563
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,068
-TEVIN: Wow.
-Ooh.
-Really? What?

564
00:26:01,172 --> 00:26:03,586
-Sorry.
-Are you new?

565
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,931
No. I'm sorry.
I thought we were gonna split,

566
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:08,103
and then it was gonna be...
I-I know it's not a tribe.

567
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:09,413
Okay, whatever.
Just do your thing.

568
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:11,448
-I'll do my thing.
-Sorry.

569
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:14,206
So right now,
you're in Survivorlimbo.

570
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,482
You don't have a Buff.

571
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:18,034
Technically, you are not
part of a tribe,

572
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:21,724
but for at least six of you,
that's about to change.

573
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:24,103
Let's get into it.
For today's challenge,

574
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:27,448
we're gonna randomly divide
you into two groups of six.

575
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:29,586
On my go, one at a time,

576
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,103
you'll race under a muddy net

577
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:33,689
to a cart.

578
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:35,793
Once everybody's at the cart,

579
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:37,517
you'll push that cart
through the field,

580
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,310
collecting very heavy sandbags
along the way.

581
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:43,034
You'll then use those sandbags

582
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:45,448
to get you
to the top of a tower.

583
00:26:45,551 --> 00:26:49,379
Once everybody's up top,
you'll collect a bag of keys,

584
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,137
slide down the other side.

585
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,000
You're not finished.

586
00:26:54,103 --> 00:26:57,000
You will then work together
to climb

587
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:58,586
a massive boulder.

588
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:01,448
When everyone's at the top,
two players

589
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:04,482
at a time will use one crate
of puzzle pieces

590
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:07,379
to solve one section

591
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:10,344
of a three-section puzzle.

592
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:13,896
So everybody's on the puzzle.

593
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,310
-TEVIN: Mm-hmm.
-MORIAH: Wow.

594
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:17,137

...and immunity
at tonight's Tribal Council.

598
00:27:25,241 --> 00:27:26,655
-Yes.
-You'll go to Tribal.

599
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,689
You will cast a vote,

600
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:30,551
-but you can't be voted for.
-Wow.

601
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:34,310
Losing group,
no Buff, no meal, no immunity.

602
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:36,413
-Damn.
-PROBST: Because there are 13,

603
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:38,275
one person will not run.

604
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:41,413
Whoever draws the gray rock
will choose one group

605
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:43,655
and win or lose with them.

606
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:45,103

All right, here we go.

612
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:56,793
Your fate is in your hands.

Your entire game

614
00:28:01,275 --> 00:28:02,413
could change

615
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:05,551
based on a rock draw.

616
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:08,931
Does not rock.

617
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:10,275
MORIAH: Does not rock.

618
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:12,379
-PROBST: All right.
-Mercy!

619
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,586
All right,
everybody palms out,

620
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:21,379
flip 'em over and reveal.

621
00:28:27,827 --> 00:28:29,827
All right, everybody palms out,

622
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:32,517

624
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:38,310

If you have purple, go
to Purple, and if you have gray,

-Oh, no way.

Let's see what we got.

628
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:48,034
No way!

629
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:49,655
That's... [laughs]

630
00:28:49,758 --> 00:28:51,965
-No way!
-PROBST: Wow.

631
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:53,896
-Well, there you go.
-I want to cry right now.
-Oh, my God.

632
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,448
PROBST:
All right, so,

633
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:59,275
completely random draw.

634
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:02,655
-You couldn't be more lopsided.
-Wow.

635
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:04,965
-It's tough for them, huh? Yeah?
-Too much.

636
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:06,413
-PROBST: Kenzie?
-Yes.

637
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:07,724
PROBST:
What do you make of this?

638
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:09,344
Because you are
on what would appear

639
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,034
to be the better side
of the draw.

640
00:29:11,137 --> 00:29:12,448
We don't know.
We haven't run it.

641
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,620
Um, yeah, I think, uh,
I'm gonna carry this whole team

642
00:29:15,724 --> 00:29:17,793
-on my shoulders.
-Right.

643
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:20,896
I got these boys ready
to take it on, you know? Um,

644
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,482
I haven't had very much luck,
and I do think it's a game.

645
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:24,896
Y'all have a fair shot.

646
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,103
-Fair.
-KENZIE: But I'm feeling
a little...

647
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:28,482
a little good right now.

648
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:30,827
All right,
so let's go through our groups.

649
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:33,551
For Orange, we have

taking on Ben, Q, Kenzie,
Hunter, Tim and Tevin.

657
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,103
All right, Tiff,
you have a big decision to make.

658
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:56,482
Which group are you gonna
put your fate with?

659
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,827
It's really tough, Jeff.
I don't know.

660
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,724
I think
I'm gonna go with Purple.

661
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:02,689
-Yeah.
-PROBST: All right,
so Tiff has chosen Purple.

662
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:05,000
You will win or lose with them.

663
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,517
You'll have a spot at the end.

664
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,551

and feeling that pressure

848
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:04,758
of Soda and Moriah
on their tail.

849
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:12,413
It is Soda and Moriah on
the same section of the puzzle

850
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:14,862
with Ben and Kenzie.

851
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:17,000
Would anyone have predicted this

852
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:20,137
moments before
we started this challenge?

853
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:22,172
No.

854
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:25,344
You can never predict what's
gonna happen out here.

855
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:26,862
-TIM: There you go.
-TEVIN: Yeah.

856
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:28,448
PROBST:
This section is difficult.

857
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:30,068
That one up there's
flipped over, too.

858
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:33,310
-PROBST: But right now,
we look pretty even.
-TEVIN: Yeah.

859
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:34,793
That one in your hand.
Yes. Right there.

860

Keep that momentum.

863
00:37:41,482 --> 00:37:44,482
-Q: That's it, Kenzie.
-PROBST: Purple
picking up the pace now.

Down to just a few pieces
left in this second section.

865
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:51,551

-LIZ: There you go.
-PROBST: This is close.

867
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:53,896

Third section of the puzzle.

872
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:04,827
-We're just one piece behind.
-LIZ: There you go, Mo.

873
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:06,517
-PROBST: Orange is right behind.

Here comes Venus and Charlie...

876
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:12,896
Y'all got to go
fast, guys, fast.

877
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,448
...for the third and final
section of their puzzle.

878
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:18,413
We're back on.

00:38:18,517 --> 00:38:20,413
That one. That one.
That one. Yes.

880
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:23,137
Purple doing a nice job.

881

-BEN: There you go...
-PROBST: One piece at a time.

882
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:29,620
Can Orange close the gap?
It's Charlie and Venus.

883
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,034
All the pressure now on them.

884
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:32,793
TIM:
Bring that triangle down.

885
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:35,482
-You know where it goes.
-PROBST: This is
a very close challenge.

886
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:40,689
Charlie and Venus trying
to catch and pass Hunter and Q.

887
00:38:40,793 --> 00:38:42,379
KENZIE:
I know, I know.
You guys are doing so good.

888
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:44,103
[overlapping chatter]

889
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:46,551

892
00:38:51,103 --> 00:38:52,689
PROBST:
Hunter is on a roll.

893
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:54,103
Go, go, go. You got it.

894
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,965
Orange is gonna have to kick it
into high gear right now.

895
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,551
That one! That one!

896
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:00,517
PROBST:
It's been a valiant effort,
but they are behind

897
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,896

Don't give up.
You got this, guys.

Good job, y'all. That was tough.

You were in it. That was tough.

919
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:51,586
-I don't even care.
-[laughing]

920
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,275
All right, Purple,
congratulations.

921
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:57,310
-You have made the merge.
-Yay!

922
00:39:57,413 --> 00:39:59,137
-PROBST: Your merge Buffs

-Want to do it?

00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:01,068
KENZIE:
We can all do it. We all did it.

924
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:03,241
PROBST:
Put 'em on. Celebrate.
You earned it.

925
00:40:03,344 --> 00:40:04,689
Oh, my God!

926
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:06,896
PROBST:
Biggest challenge of the season.

927
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,758
Shred red.

928
00:40:08,862 --> 00:40:10,965

-PROBST: All right, so here's
what's gonna happen.

929

You're all going
back to camp together.

930
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:15,379
The seven of you
will have a nice merge meal,

931
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:16,827
separate from everyone else.

932
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,137
Everybody goes
to Tribal Council tonight.

933
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,206
Everybody votes,
but nobody can vote for you.

934
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,827
The only six people
who can be voted for

935
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:28,379
are Moriah, Charlie,
Venus, Liz, Soda and Maria.

936
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:31,413
One of these six--
your journey will end

937
00:40:31,517 --> 00:40:34,103
13 days into Survivor46.
Grab your stuff, head out.

938
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:35,586
See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

PROBST:
Head on down.

941
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:39,620
Good job, guys.

942
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:42,206
This was a clear
David versus Goliath situation.

943
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,896
And the Davids did really well,
I feel like.

944
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,586
But losing this challenge
really hurt.

945
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:49,620
I've been on Nami, and
we've been on a winning streak.

946
00:40:49,724 --> 00:40:50,827
This is my first Tribal.

947
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:52,827
This is uncharted territory
for me,

948
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:55,689
which is why I might be,
like, freaking out.

949
00:40:55,793 --> 00:40:56,862
I have agita.

950
00:40:56,965 --> 00:40:58,068
Agita, where you get,
like, chest pains,

951
00:40:58,172 --> 00:40:59,344
like a mini heart attack.

952
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:00,689
I have agita.

953
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,241
[laughs]:
That's what I have right now.

954
00:41:08,517 --> 00:41:09,896
[whispering]: Aw, this is where
the game gets really good.

955
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,103
Who are we gonna vote out?

956
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:12,551

I got my merge Buff.
I won immunity.

962
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:33,482
I'm safe at Tribal tonight,
and I won a feast.

963
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:35,517
I can see
the structure from here.

964
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,689
The losers keep on walking.

965

I'm so sorry for you,

966
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:40,413
but my mouth
is already salivating.

There's no Buff.
There's no feast for Venus.

choke on that food. [chuckles]

Even though we lost,
it wasn't by that much.

976
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:03,172
We were this close.
We were so close.

977

by everyone.

979

VENUS:
Just the fact that it wasn't
this big blowout loss--

980
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:12,310
it just warmed my-my cold,
dead heart, you know?

981
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:13,758
I was like, "Oh, my God.

982

tenseness in the air.

I don't know
if you guys looked over,

989
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:27,448
but I was looking at Tiffany's
face the whole time. She...

990
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:30,034
MORIAH:
The team that lost
has three on Nami--

991
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:31,448
Venus, Soda and Liz--

992
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,344
and three on Siga--
Maria, Charlie and myself.

993
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:36,137
None of us have Buffs.

994

We know that there are
votes coming to one of us.

995
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:41,482

hitting, y'all.

I'm trying to take it easy
with the wine,

I think this is a turning point
for the Yanu tribe.

1013
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,344
With this whole bottle of wine.

1014
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:20,379
[laughing]

1015
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:22,275
Tiff, Q and I-- we're all safe.

1016
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:24,655
Siga and Nami
are on the chopping block.

1017
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,586
So we're all just, like,

1018
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:28,517
deciding which way
we want to go.

1019
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,482
I think we're
in a peculiar position,

1020
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:32,103
'cause we got all of Yanu here.

1021
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:33,689
So y'all have an advantage.

1022
00:43:33,793 --> 00:43:37,103
Siga and Nami
are evenly numbered

1023
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:38,655
on the losing tribe.

1024
00:43:38,758 --> 00:43:40,344
HUNTER:
I can't even vote.

1025
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:41,862
-TIFFANY: Damn.
-TEVIN: Ooh.

1026
00:43:41,965 --> 00:43:43,241
Hunter can't vote,

1027
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:46,379
but, on day two, I took
a journey and got an extra vote.

1028
00:43:46,482 --> 00:43:48,034
And at Tribal Council,

1029
00:43:48,137 --> 00:43:50,068
there should be an extra vote
sitting there, waiting for me.

1030
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:51,344
TIM:
We vote, right?

1031
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:52,827
-KENZIE: Yeah, we all vote.
-TIFFANY: We vote.

1032
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:55,965
TEVIN:
Siga and Nami are even,
number-wise,

1033
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:57,344
and all Yanu's here,

1034
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:59,620
which means they're
safe tonight at Tribal Council.

1035
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:01,827
So it could be a Nami.
It could be a Siga.

1036
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,862
So, how you feel
about your tribe, Nami?

1037
00:44:04,965 --> 00:44:07,310
All I will say
is that from day one--

1038
00:44:07,413 --> 00:44:08,482
and I've been
very vocal about it--

1039
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:09,931
is that I don't trust Venus.

1040
00:44:10,034 --> 00:44:12,068
TIM:
Moriah, Venus and I
talked at the water well,

1041
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:14,413
and Venus was
thinking about opportunities.

1042
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:17,241
It completely validates
why you may not trust her.

1043
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:19,724
I could see
why that would be something

1044
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:21,965
you wouldn't want
to work with going forward.

1045
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:25,724
Q: Y'all got
to declare somebody, man.

1046
00:44:25,827 --> 00:44:28,068
-Yeah.
-Well, okay,
so who's y'all's Siga person?

1047
00:44:28,172 --> 00:44:29,862
BEN:
I feel like it's hard.
I know it sounds like I'm,

1048
00:44:29,965 --> 00:44:34,482
like, playing a cover, but...
really, we just had that Tribal.

1049
00:44:34,586 --> 00:44:37,034
I don't want to throw
anybody's name out from Siga.

1050
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:38,793
I really want
to go Siga strong.

1051
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:41,172
But everybody keeps asking,
"Yo, what's up with Siga?

1052
00:44:41,275 --> 00:44:43,034
You guys got
to throw a name out there."

1053
00:44:43,137 --> 00:44:44,586
-So we got out of that Tribal...
-HUNTER: Who was that?

1054
00:44:44,689 --> 00:44:45,655
-Jem.
-TIM: Jem.

1055
00:44:45,758 --> 00:44:47,482
-Jem's gone.
-BEN: Yeah.

1056
00:44:47,586 --> 00:44:50,103
TIFFANY:
Siga's kind of beating
around the bush a little bit.

1057
00:44:50,206 --> 00:44:52,379
They don't really want
to throw out a name.

1058
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:53,896
They're not really trying
to work with us,

1059
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,241
despite the fact that

1060
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:56,896
that's the impression
they're trying to give off.

1061
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,586
If you were, then you
wouldn't be so tight-lipped

1062
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:00,896
about who on your tribe
you were willing

1063
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,172
to put on the chopping block.

1064
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:03,965
Q:
Siga got to declare somebody.

1065
00:45:04,931 --> 00:45:06,344
KENZIE: Who's a threat?

1066
00:45:09,862 --> 00:45:11,965
TEVIN:
I was about-- I've heard through
the grapevine that she's savvy.

1067
00:45:12,068 --> 00:45:14,482
TIFFANY:
I've heard her, like,
spit some crazy Survivorfacts.

1068
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,965
If she know this game like that,
that scare me, dawg.

1069
00:45:17,068 --> 00:45:21,344
Do you think that Venus or Mo
is more manipulative?

1070
00:45:21,448 --> 00:45:23,655
TIFFANY:
In my personal opinion,
I would be more intimidated

1071
00:45:23,758 --> 00:45:25,724
by somebody who's
more knowledgeable than somebody

1072
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:27,000
who's just being shiesty,

1073
00:45:27,103 --> 00:45:29,103
because shiesty
you can sniff out a mile away.

1074
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:31,620
Somebody who's smart
could outmaneuver you

1075
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:33,620
in a lot of different ways.

1076
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:37,586
While they're quickly
trying to get Venus out,

1077
00:45:37,689 --> 00:45:40,068
they're basically just showing
their hand and saying that

1078
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:41,206
they're trying
to stay Siga strong.

1079
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,172
TIM:
I'm not saying Mo's off-limits.

1080
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:46,344
I want Venus now.
You have Mo. Let's vote.

1081
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:48,793
TIFFANY:
Because they were
so willing to vote Venus

1082
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:51,655
and more reluctant to say Mo,
it made me

1083
00:45:51,758 --> 00:45:54,793
want to vote Mo.

1084
00:46:01,379 --> 00:46:03,413
♪ ♪

1085
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:12,517
TIM:
Who's the bigger threat,
Venus or Moriah?

1086
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,827
MORIAH:
Oh, they're coming back.

1087
00:46:13,931 --> 00:46:15,137
-SODA: Are they?
-MORIAH: Yeah, I see Q.

1088
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:17,827
Okay. Okay. Angry faces.
No, don't clap for these people.

1089
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:21,448
TIM: Everybody agrees
that Venus is a snake

1090
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:23,310
and some people agree
that Mo is a threat.

1091
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,551
CHARLIE:
Hello.

1092
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:26,862
-VENUS: Hello. Wow.
-Hey.

1093
00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:28,655
Yay.

1094
00:46:31,827 --> 00:46:35,275
TIM:
At the feast, they said,
"We want you to vote for Mo."

1095
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,620
Why would I vote
for somebody on my tribe?

1096
00:46:37,724 --> 00:46:39,172
We want to hear about the feast.

1097
00:46:39,275 --> 00:46:40,862
BEN:
Come on, don't make us
feel guilty, dude.

1098
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,000
-MORIAH: I really want to know.
-CHARLIE: No, tell me.

1099
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:45,000
TIM:
Yes, I threw
Mo's name out there,

1100
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:48,379
but I'm trying
to swing things towards Venus.

1101
00:46:48,482 --> 00:46:50,413
I am protecting Mo

1102
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:53,310
and really protecting
Siga's numbers.

1103
00:46:56,896 --> 00:46:59,586
-Any talk over there?
-So... Yeah, definitely talks.

1104
00:46:59,689 --> 00:47:01,275
What's the deal?

1105
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:04,379
Everybody had to throw a name.

1106
00:47:04,482 --> 00:47:06,034
-Okay.
-Nami,

1107
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:09,241
it seems like there's
some distrust with Venus.

1108
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:10,586
Okay.

1109
00:47:10,689 --> 00:47:13,000
-For Siga's name...
-Yeah.

1110
00:47:13,103 --> 00:47:14,689
-I said Mo.
-Okay.

1111
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:16,137
And if I was
gonna give 'em a name...

1112
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:18,965
-Yeah.
-[scoffs] I'm not
giving 'em Charlie's name.

1113
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:20,000
Okay.

1114
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:21,862
What I'm hearing
is Venus and Mo.

1115
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,448
And I don't want Mo to go,

1116
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:25,655
but this is
an incredibly important vote.

1117
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:28,620
-Yanu's gonna vote Mo,
but I'm voting Venus.
-So...

1118
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:30,482
I'm not gonna
go down in numbers first.

1119
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:34,241
Um, Mo's gonna get
a little antsy from that.

1120
00:47:34,344 --> 00:47:37,793
She is. So with that, we have
to tell her to vote Venus.

1121
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,448
If it's five of us,
we keep our five.

1122
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:42,344
CHARLIE:
The question is,
how hard do we push

1123
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:44,931
to save Mo at this point?

1124
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:47,137
This is the individual part
of the game.

1125
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:48,965
I have to get through this vote.

1126
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:53,275
And if Mo going home
is what it takes for me to stay,

1127
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:54,896
that's what
has to happen tonight.

1128
00:47:57,793 --> 00:47:58,827
Right.

1129
00:48:03,586 --> 00:48:05,931
HUNTER:
I want to guide this vote,
even if I can't vote.

1130
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:07,448
You need more big sticks?

1131
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,827
HUNTER:
Ultimately, I want
to take out Moriah

1132
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:10,586
because Siga is so strong.

1133
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:12,103
If we leave Siga in this,

1134
00:48:12,206 --> 00:48:13,517
it's gonna get tough later.

1135
00:48:14,551 --> 00:48:15,965
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure.

1136
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:18,000
Okay?

1137
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,689
Q:
Siga is a stronger tribe,

1138
00:48:22,793 --> 00:48:25,206
right now, than Nami.

1139
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,344
-SODA: How many hours do
you think we have before Tribal?
-Like, three.

1140
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:30,379
Q:
Siga-- they're trying
to keep it together.

1141
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:32,241
Nami has cracks.

1142
00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:34,275
So it might be wiser
for us to side with Nami

1143
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:36,206
and vote out Mo.

1144
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,655
I want your opinion, though.

1145
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:39,034
Who do you think
is the right call?

1146
00:48:39,137 --> 00:48:40,482
Should we do Siga, Nami?

1147
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:42,172
I needed just
an honest vibe on...

1148
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:46,034
LIZ:
We were like, "Where's Tiff?"

1149
00:48:46,137 --> 00:48:47,689
I was hoping that you weren't
down on the beach.

1150
00:48:47,793 --> 00:48:49,517
Uh, you got to vote Mo tonight,
if you want to stay.

1151
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,758
VENUS: "It's Mo.
And if you don't

1152
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,310
vote Mo, it's you."

1153
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:55,206
That really pissed me off.

1154
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,758
TIFFANY:
This is what happened.
The name from your camp was you.

1155
00:48:58,862 --> 00:49:00,793
We were waiting a while
for Siga to throw a name out,

1156
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,655
and they wouldn't.
We need to...

1157
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:04,413
-It needs to be a Siga today.
-VENUS: I agree with Siga.

1158
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:05,551
I'm unsure about Mo.

1159
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:10,172
Let's give it a beat.
Let me talk a little bit more.

1160
00:49:10,275 --> 00:49:11,310
But for now, we know Siga.

1161
00:49:11,413 --> 00:49:12,586
TIFFANY:
But I'm just telling y'all,

1162
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:14,310
do not say anything, because...

1163
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,000
-Oh, I'm not gonna
breathe a word.
-TIFFANY: Y'all might...

1164
00:49:16,103 --> 00:49:17,586
VENUS:
When someone hears their name,
it's easy to,

1165
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:19,517
like, go into panic mode.
Like, "Oh, my God."

1166
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,793
Like, "Anything but me."

1167
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:23,310
But I realized, in that moment,

1168
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:24,689
this is a stupid vote.

1169
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:25,931
Charlie would be a smarter vote.

1170
00:49:26,034 --> 00:49:27,827
A man needs to go next.

1171
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:31,448
Charlie is the only man
that we can vote out tonight,

1172
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,517
so I want Charlie gone.

1173
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,310
Did they say anything else
about Mo?

1174
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:35,758
-Specifically? The guys?
-KENZIE: No.

1175
00:49:35,862 --> 00:49:38,000
VENUS:
I need to understand why Mo.

1176
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,448
If it's 'cause
she's a superfan alone,

1177
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:41,137
you should be scared
for the next vote.

1178
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:43,103
That's why
we should think Charlie.

1179
00:49:43,206 --> 00:49:44,793
Have you picked that up
from Siga's dynamics?

1180
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:47,275
-Yeah, but the boys
are super close, extremely.
-Like, why...

1181
00:49:47,379 --> 00:49:49,896
That's why I was saying Charlie
should be the name, not Mo.

1182
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,793
It'd be stupid of us
to vote out a girl

1183
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:54,448
because the three boys say...

1184
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:56,827
Look, all the ... men
went on a feast.

1185
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:58,655
[inhales sharply]

1186
00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:01,344
You're not wrong about that.

1187
00:50:01,448 --> 00:50:03,793
KENZIE:
Venus is pissed.

1188
00:50:03,896 --> 00:50:06,241
She's mad
that Mo's name is out there.

1189
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:07,551
Venus doesn't want

1190
00:50:07,655 --> 00:50:10,586
to send a girl home,
and so Venus throws out Charlie.

1191
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:13,068
This is where
the plan gets rocky,

1192
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:14,827
because if Venus
would just vote Mo,

1193
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:16,379
Mo just goes. Easy.

1194
00:50:16,482 --> 00:50:18,172
Venus doesn't want Mo.

1195
00:50:18,275 --> 00:50:20,793
-I know what
Venus has got going on.
-And, see, what scares me is...

1196
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:22,172
[laughs]

1197
00:50:26,137 --> 00:50:27,137
Yeah.

1198
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:29,379
Yeah.

1199
00:50:29,482 --> 00:50:31,275
Mad. Not just like...

1200
00:50:31,379 --> 00:50:35,034
Q:
I just told Venus
that it's either her or Mo.

1201
00:50:35,137 --> 00:50:37,758
So if she mad about it,
I'll vote Venus.

1202
00:50:37,862 --> 00:50:39,551
I'm going Venus. I can't...

1203
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:42,413
The girls right now in this game
have seven to six on the men.

1204
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:44,620
Venus don't want
to vote a woman.

1205
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:46,517
That's why she was throwing out

1206
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,793
Charlie's name
at the water well.

1207
00:50:47,896 --> 00:50:48,896
But I have to make sure

1208
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,103
Venus understands
I put my game on the line

1209
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:54,448
and told you
exactly what is gonna happen.

1210
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,448
If you gonna be ungrateful...

1211
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:58,482
I'll send your ass
back to Canada.
-KENZIE: So what are you gonna

1212
00:50:58,586 --> 00:51:00,172
tell Venus-- Mo?

1213
00:51:00,275 --> 00:51:01,655
I ain't talking
about Venus no more.

1214
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,206
-Okay.
-Damn, Venus.

1215
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,931
TEVIN:
I'm okay to send Venus home

1216
00:51:05,034 --> 00:51:06,551
because I have not
trusted Venus since day one.

1217
00:51:06,655 --> 00:51:07,965
She's been running around
this island alone.

1218
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:09,344
I don't know
if she has a Beware Advantage.

1219
00:51:09,448 --> 00:51:10,620
She's been spinning

1220
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:12,137
narratives on me.
And all of those things

1221
00:51:12,241 --> 00:51:14,379
line up in a way
that make me feel like I can't

1222
00:51:14,482 --> 00:51:16,896
trust Venus at all,

1223
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,344
and therefore she must go.

1224
00:51:19,448 --> 00:51:21,000
Tevin will go...

1225
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:24,275
And then all of us go...

1226
00:51:25,379 --> 00:51:26,310
Okay.

1227
00:51:26,413 --> 00:51:28,724
I am so worried.

1228
00:51:28,827 --> 00:51:31,482
I-I know my name
has been out there.

1229
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:34,034
It is annoying
to hear your name go down,

1230
00:51:34,137 --> 00:51:36,068
-Mm-hmm.
-but there's more

1231
00:51:36,172 --> 00:51:38,689
votes on Venus.

1232
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:41,517
MORIAH:
Going into the merge,
I decided to work with Siga.

1233
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,931
I fear that I am putting

1234
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:45,344
my loyalty and my trust
in the wrong spot.

1235
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:48,344
So I feel like I have
a lot of work to do today

1236
00:51:48,448 --> 00:51:51,965
to make sure
I'm not going home tonight.

1237
00:51:53,275 --> 00:51:55,137
TIFFANY:
We got to get on the same page.

1238
00:51:55,241 --> 00:51:56,413
Where is Q at?

1239
00:51:56,517 --> 00:51:57,793
TEVIN:
There he go. Yes. Come here.

1240
00:51:57,896 --> 00:51:59,344
-TIFFANY: Yes, please.
-TEVIN: Come here, please.

1241
00:51:59,448 --> 00:52:00,965
-It's got to be quick.
-TIFFANY: What the ...
is going on?

1242
00:52:01,068 --> 00:52:02,689
-I don't know what the...
-HUNTER: Why'd you change it?

1243
00:52:02,793 --> 00:52:05,000
-Just stick with Mo.
-Venus is moving around,

1244
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:07,206
saying all kinds of ...

1245
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,034
-What'd she say?
-HUNTER: Venus gonna
get herself voted out.

1246
00:52:09,137 --> 00:52:11,310
TEVIN:
He also doesn't like
that Venus is playing a game

1247
00:52:11,413 --> 00:52:13,034
that we don't want
to vote out none of the women.

1248
00:52:13,137 --> 00:52:14,655
She says she don't want
to vote no women out.

1249
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:16,034
HUNTER:
Who's she gonna vote out?

1250
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:18,793
Then why
are we worried about it?

1251
00:52:18,896 --> 00:52:20,551
Things are kind of chaotic
right now because

1252
00:52:20,655 --> 00:52:22,620
whoever goes home tonight,

1253
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:25,862
Mo or Venus is
gonna be the determining factor

1254
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:28,758
of the trajectory
of the next couple of votes.

1255
00:52:29,724 --> 00:52:31,068
On paper, Yanu has

1256
00:52:31,172 --> 00:52:32,655
a really large say
in tonight's vote,

1257
00:52:32,758 --> 00:52:35,551
but based
on how conversations go,

1258
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:36,931
that could quickly change.

1259
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:39,275
All I know is that
I'm glad I'm safe tonight

1260
00:52:39,379 --> 00:52:41,000
because, baby,
it's about to get messy.

1261
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,344
♪ ♪

1262
00:53:17,034 --> 00:53:19,206
PROBST:
For whom it is
your first time at Tribal,

1263
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:23,241
grab an unlit torch,
dip it in and get fire.

1264
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:40,310
This is part
of the ritual at Tribal Council

1265
00:53:40,413 --> 00:53:43,379
because in this game,
fire represents your life.

1266
00:53:43,482 --> 00:53:46,689
When your fire's gone,
so are you.

1267
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,689
All right. A lot going on.
13 people here.

1268
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:53,482
Seven are safe, six are not.

1269
00:53:53,586 --> 00:53:56,275
Tevin, the juxtaposition
of having

1270
00:53:56,379 --> 00:53:57,931
more than half the group

1271
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:01,275
completely safe is very unusual
at Tribal Council.

1272
00:54:01,379 --> 00:54:04,482
The perfect word that you
just used is "juxtaposition,"

1273
00:54:04,586 --> 00:54:07,344
because though I am protected,

1274
00:54:07,448 --> 00:54:09,689
I still have to be very aware
of what is happening

1275
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:12,241
at this Tribal Council,
because this will add up to what

1276
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:15,655
will happen when I'm inevitably
maybe not safe at the next one.

1277
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:18,758
PROBST:
Q, what is it like having

1278
00:54:18,862 --> 00:54:21,827
seven people that are safe?

1279
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:25,931
So, for me, Jeff, I'm just happy
that I'm one of the seven

1280
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:29,931
that has this so far,
because going back to camp

1281
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:33,827
after that feast was like
my little brother kicking over

1282
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:36,517
an ant pile and the ants
just started running at me.

1283
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,448
-[laughing]
-It was like,
"You had time to eat, buddy.

1284
00:54:39,551 --> 00:54:40,655
Now, it's time to talk."

1285
00:54:40,758 --> 00:54:44,000
And we'll see where
things kind of shake up.

1286
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:46,172
PROBST:
So, Charlie, as one of the six,

1287
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:49,344
can you try to move the game
in a direction you want?

1288
00:54:49,448 --> 00:54:52,034
Being part of the six, I feel
like I'm a goalkeeper, you know?

1289
00:54:52,137 --> 00:54:54,758
I have a goal,
and I'm not taking any shots.

1290
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,758
All I'm doing is blocking,
you know?

1291
00:54:56,862 --> 00:54:58,103
I'm just listening.

1292
00:54:58,206 --> 00:55:00,758
If I hear the name Charlie,
I got to get to work.

1293
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:04,344
How about for you, Venus?
Can you still play offensively

1294
00:55:04,448 --> 00:55:06,793
even though you're trying
to make sure it's not you?

1295
00:55:06,896 --> 00:55:10,034
Oh, 100%, Jeff.
You never give up.

1296
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:12,758
None of us want our names
written down, but, also, like,

1297
00:55:12,862 --> 00:55:14,586
if the kings of the castle
over there,

1298
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:17,310
who already have their Buffs,
say a name,

1299
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:19,137
you have to listen out
for whether or not

1300
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:22,517
your name's being said and to
move that target off your back.

1301
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:24,724
So, Hunter,

1302
00:55:24,827 --> 00:55:27,482
how is it decided
who you're gonna vote for?

1303
00:55:27,586 --> 00:55:31,103
HUNTER:
Yeah, I don't have a say in this
vote, and so I'll break the ice.

1304
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:33,448
The Yanu has
the choice right now,

1305
00:55:33,551 --> 00:55:36,689
and they have to choose
who's gonna lose a number: Siga

1306
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:38,896
or Nami.
And right now

1307
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,655
Siga is really, really close.

1308
00:55:40,758 --> 00:55:43,793
Like, the cloud nine of vibes.

1309
00:55:43,896 --> 00:55:45,931
And, Moriah,
that's what Hunter should do--

1310
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:48,413
throw it on another tribe,
not his.

1311
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:50,448
Yeah, I mean,
I'd be lying if I said

1312
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:51,655
we weren't doing the same,

1313
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:54,724
but I'll let you all
in a little secret here.

1314
00:55:54,827 --> 00:55:57,793
It was not unanimous
at the last Tribal Council.

1315
00:55:59,896 --> 00:56:01,655
I was the odd out.

1316
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,310
I didn't get the vote right.

1317
00:56:03,413 --> 00:56:07,000
I am on the damn bottom,
and I do not fit in.

1318
00:56:08,896 --> 00:56:11,000
HUNTER:
But perception
is just reality, though.

1319
00:56:11,103 --> 00:56:12,310
Like, none of us knew that

1320
00:56:12,413 --> 00:56:13,655
-because y'all
did such a good job.
-Yeah.

1321
00:56:13,758 --> 00:56:15,241
And so
if that was the case, like,

1322
00:56:15,344 --> 00:56:17,034
-you have to help us
with our perceptions.
-MORIAH: Yeah.

1323
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:20,275
Yeah, and I'm-I'm helping
you along as I can. I mean...

1324
00:56:20,379 --> 00:56:21,724
Well, you're talking
to the guy who can't vote.

1325
00:56:21,827 --> 00:56:22,896
-Yeah.
-[laughing]

1326
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,137
I think I'm talking
pretty loudly

1327
00:56:24,241 --> 00:56:25,896
to the guy that can't vote.

1328
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,068
-[laughs]
-But the question
really is up to Yanu.

1329
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:33,241
Q, in a game all about numbers,

1330
00:56:33,344 --> 00:56:35,862
Moriah just said,
"I'm not a part of that group."

1331
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:38,000
Is that appealing?

1332
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:41,000
It's appealing, Jeff,
if I feel like the information

1333
00:56:41,103 --> 00:56:45,517
is accurate, because this
is the first time I'm personally

1334
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,000
hearing that
she was on the bottom.

1335
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:51,586
Q, I'm serving it up to you
on a silver platter here.

1336
00:56:51,689 --> 00:56:53,827
-But I'm a man of truth.
-Yeah?

1337
00:56:53,931 --> 00:56:55,172
Q:
And in one conversation

1338
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:57,000
that we had,
I asked a simple question.

1339
00:56:57,103 --> 00:56:58,034
MORIAH:
Yeah.

1340
00:56:58,137 --> 00:57:00,551
Q:
What went on at Tribal for Siga?

1341
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:02,862
That probably
would have been a time to say,

1342
00:57:02,965 --> 00:57:05,413
"I am on the bottom.
I need help."

1343
00:57:05,517 --> 00:57:08,206
But instead, I was told
that the vote was unanimous.

1344
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,931
So, Moriah,
are you playing for Siga

1345
00:57:12,034 --> 00:57:13,517
or are you playing for you?

1346
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,793
I'm playing for me.
I want that merge Buff.

1347
00:57:15,896 --> 00:57:19,103
If you were on the bottom,
why not express that?

1348
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:20,482
-You see what I'm saying?
-Yeah.

1349
00:57:20,586 --> 00:57:22,896
Don't let anyone
mute you in this game

1350
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,344
if you feel like
you're on the bottom.

1351
00:57:25,448 --> 00:57:28,241
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Q: That's valuable information.

1352
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,793
-MORIAH: Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1353
00:57:31,793 --> 00:57:33,000
PROBST:
Tim, weigh in on this,

1354
00:57:33,103 --> 00:57:36,172
because a lot
of information is coming out

1355
00:57:36,275 --> 00:57:39,310
and it is a showdown
between two tribes,

1356
00:57:39,413 --> 00:57:41,344
with the Yanu three
in the middle.

1357
00:57:41,448 --> 00:57:44,862
Yeah, I mean, they were kind of
forced to make a decision

1358
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:48,793
on choosing someone from Nami
or choosing someone from Siga.

1359
00:57:48,896 --> 00:57:51,620
And so at the feast,
we went around the table

1360
00:57:51,724 --> 00:57:54,896
and everybody
that had a vote said a name.

1361
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,206
And at the feast, we left
with a clear understanding

1362
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:02,137
of who might be voting for who
at tonight's Tribal Council.

1363
00:58:02,241 --> 00:58:04,137
Charlie, did you hear your name?

1364
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:08,379
I heard whispers,
but my way of dealing

1365
00:58:08,482 --> 00:58:12,103
with the whispers is to go
to the people that I trust,

1366
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:14,517
that I've connected with,
that I've spoken with,

1367
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,172
and saying, "Do I need
to go scramble like crazy

1368
00:58:17,275 --> 00:58:19,758
or was this just a whisper?"

1369
00:58:19,862 --> 00:58:21,862
Venus, did you hear your name?

1370
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:24,275
Oh, yeah. A lot.

1371
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,931
Plenty of times.
A terrifying amount of times.

1372
00:58:27,034 --> 00:58:29,448
But you can't
let that get to you.

1373
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:32,482
I mean, realistically,
I hope the people around me

1374
00:58:32,586 --> 00:58:35,965
are smart enough to see
the value I could bring to them,

1375
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:39,827
and if they're as smart of
a player that I think they are,

1376
00:58:39,931 --> 00:58:43,620
they'll probably want to keep me
around over someone else.

1377
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:46,103
So, Moriah, how are you feeling?

1378
00:58:46,206 --> 00:58:49,000
You pitched a case.
People seem to be hearing it.

1379
00:58:49,103 --> 00:58:52,310
Are you feeling
optimistic or pessimistic?

1380
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:55,068
I know what
I wanted to say today.

1381
00:58:55,172 --> 00:58:58,379
I'll tell you right now, I might
be the most honest person

1382
00:58:58,482 --> 00:59:00,551
at this Tribal Council.
And, you know,

1383
00:59:00,655 --> 00:59:01,862
there's important information
out here.

1384
00:59:01,965 --> 00:59:04,655
I know how whispers fly
and how whispers go,

1385
00:59:04,758 --> 00:59:06,724
and I wanted
to say it loud and clear

1386
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:10,034
for all of you
to hear what happened.

1387
00:59:10,137 --> 00:59:12,379
