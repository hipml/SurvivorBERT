<i>This is a very dangerous</i>
<i>season of</i> Survivor,

170
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,006
and I just put myself in
a very dangerous situation.

171
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,420
Damn. Nothing in this hole.

172
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,388
Ah.

173
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,058
Nothing.

174
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,393
I want everybody on the Internet
to shut up,

175
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,295
talking
"Idols are easy to find."

176
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,831
<i>The idol is-is power</i>
<i>in this game.</i>

177
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,399
Nothing.

178
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,536
<i>I've been everywhere</i>
<i>on this island, you know?</i>

179
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,105
And I still haven't found it!

180
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,574
And it's gonna drive me insane.

181
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,243
What am I missing?

182
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,544
<i>But I do have one advantage.</i>

183
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,646
<i>I have an extra vote.</i>

184
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,581
<i>I didn't come here</i>
<i>for just one advantage.</i>

185
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,916
I came here for them all.

186
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,051
<i>I'm working so damn hard.</i>

187
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,722
If it's not out there,
I'm gonna be so pissed off.

188
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,557
<i>This idol is so hard to find.</i>

189
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,859
Well, maybe it's hard to find
because somebody found it

190
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,829
in the easy place,
at the beginning of the game.

191
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,766
<i>Ricard could have</i>
<i>the immunity idol.</i>

192
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,601
<i>He's sly. He's sneaky.</i>

193
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,336
<i>Out of everybody's</i>
<i>knowledge of the game,</i>

194
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,006
<i>he has the best, next to mine.</i>

195
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,274
<i>And...</i>

196
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,575
Shan...

197
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,677
<i>Shan's smart.</i>

198
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,146
<i>You know, she could be like,</i>
<i>"I don't want to tell JD."</i>

199
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,317
<i>So it wouldn't surprise me</i>
<i>that much if she had it.</i>

200
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,853
<i>Genie.</i>

201
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,087
<i>And she's also been</i>
<i>looking for the idol</i>

202
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,722
<i>so many times.</i>

203
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,091
<i>And then Brad never leaves</i>
<i>the dang shelter.</i>

204
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,460
<i>And some of us are like,</i>
<i>"Maybe it was at the shelter."</i>

205
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,196
But I know I don't have it.
(chuckles)

206
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,532
SHAN:
Somebody's got to have the idol.

207
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,733
Is it you?

208
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,304
No. I don't think
anybody has it yet.

209
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,338
There's got to be an idol,
right?

210
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,307
No, doesn't got to be.

211
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,611
It's a new era.

212
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,614
It's a crazy feeling
around camp when you know

213
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,716
<i>others are going out</i>
<i>looking for the idol,</i>

214
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,284
<i>but Genie and I</i>
<i>found it together</i>

215
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,919
<i>just 30 minutes earlier.</i>

216
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,857
Ha-ha.

217
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,960
"Beware Advantage."

218
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,901
Oh, Genie.

219
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,871
<i>GENIE:</i>
<i>Oh, my God, the moment when</i>
<i>I saw the joy on-on Brad's face,</i>

220
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,440
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"I wish I had found it."</i>

221
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,208
But that is the next best thing,

222
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,344
is that my closest ally
found it.

223
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,379
He said that.

224
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,480
(quietly): Okay.

225
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,182
BRAD:
He's got it. Xander's got it.

226
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,817
I truly believe that

227
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,187
butterflies are just dead
relatives saying hi.

228
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,889
-Wow.
-(laughter)

229
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,291
<i>BRAD:</i>
<i>Xander said that exact phrase,</i>

230
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,127
and so clearly he has one.

231
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,930
That's the other one.

232
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,032
They never said that.

233
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,066
<i>And I didn't hear the one</i>

234
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,701
about the goat and Astroturf.

235
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,037
So I assume the blue tribe
hasn't found theirs.

236
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,106
Oh. This is awesome.

237
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,177
So to have two Beware Advantages
is an amazing feeling.

238
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,547
<i>It's great that</i>
<i>I have this powerless idol</i>

239
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,115
that hopefully has potential,

240
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:27,386
but the "beware" part is I can't
vote at any Tribal Council

241
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,089
<i>until the other two are found</i>
<i>and-and activated.</i>

242
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,124
Down here,
there's that white log.

243
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,492
Up here is that white tree.

244
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,995
My gut says it's here.

245
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,999
<i>BRAD:</i>
<i>And I feel worst for Shan,</i>

246
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,334
<i>because she is busting it</i>
<i>for this idol,</i>

247
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,602
<i>and I haven't told her yet,</i>

248
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,905
<i>and she's number one</i>
<i>with me and Genie.</i>

249
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:50,342
So I want her to know that
I am loyal to her all the way.

250
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,745
I got a little extra something
to help us along the way.

251
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,080
You found the idol.

252
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,483
So, it's not mobilized yet.

253
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,851
SHAN:
Brad.

254
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,587
-This is for us now.
-(gasps) Oh, my God.

255
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,256
<i>So Brad trusts me completely.</i>

256
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,396
Because you only share
that kind of information

257
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,397
with your number one.

258
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,898
Okay, now, if you're ready...

259
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,607
-What? You found both?
-Number two.

260
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,109
-All right?
-Brad, when did you find these?

261
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,277
Hey, these things
just fall out of the sky.

262
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,746
What I need from you,
there's a boat coming tonight.

263
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,381
-Okay.
-I got to get on that boat

264
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,417
-and go to an island
to make a decision.
-Okay.

265
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,085
<i>And just when I think it's over,</i>
<i>then he tells me</i>

266
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,755
<i>he also found</i>
<i>another secret advantage.</i>

267
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,757
I don't know
what any of this means.

268
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,359
-Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
-Right?

269
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,194
-Come on. (laughs)
-Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my...

270
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,163
<i>I have to figure out</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do.</i>

271
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,300
See, do I keep Brad in the game
because he's got all that power?

272
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,735

<i>BRAD:</i>
<i>So, with this Beware Advantage,</i>

276
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,941
<i>I got to sneak out at night.</i>

277
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,445
<i>And I've got</i>
<i>to be able to provide</i>

278
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,348
an appearance
that I'm still in camp,

279
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,816

<i>Man, I do not want</i>
<i>to get caught.</i>

<i>from a distance,</i>

-Right.

a<i> Survivor</i> newspaper,

746
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,444
which one of the five of you
is the face that represents Ua

Oh, gosh.
Yase kicks Ua's ass. Yes.

749
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,684
That is what is on the headline,

750
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,220
and there's a really pretty
picture of me, you know?

751
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,657
And I thought, being the athlete
that I've been,

752
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,194
that I would be easily hitting
those sandbags up there.

00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,030
But I mean,
I just couldn't get it done.

754
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,031
And that's on me.

755
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,100
Ricard, in order
to win this game

756
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,769
you have to survive
every single Tribal.

757
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,137
So what makes the most sense?

758
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,939
Having a tribe
that doesn't lose,

759
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,841
so you don't have
to go to as many Tribals.

760
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,709
Therein lies the dilemma.

761
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,946
Tribe strength
or my personal alliances.

762
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,815
You know, I'm kind of
starting to veer towards

763
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,450
my own personal alliance.

764
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,619
I'm not gonna make it very far,

765
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,622
once we hit the merge,
if I just have strong people

766
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,090
that don't actually like me.

767
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,226
I need to work with people
who I trust.

768
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,929
Wow. Genie,
Ricard is saying straight out

769
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,330
somebody in this tribe
has lied to him,

770
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,132
and he's not happy about it.

771
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:42,700
They're probably
getting his vote tonight.

772
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,703
He thinks he's got his alliance,
but I know I have mine, so...

773
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,906
Do you think that he thinks
you're the one that was lying?

774
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,142
Probably based on
the first Tribal.

775
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,444
I don't think
Ricard's ever really truly

776
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,379

779
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,555
all the time on<i> Survivor--</i>
trust.

780
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,790
BRAD:
Oh, man.

781
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,059
Jeff, the fact is,
you got to trust somebody,

782
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,627
because, in the end,
that's all you got.

783
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:10,861
-Yeah.
-BRAD: And so,

784
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,129
to build trust,
you say what you're gonna do

785
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,497
and then you do it.

786
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,667
JD:
Jeff, we're all
talking about trust,

787
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,103
and I feel like
somehow, someway,

788
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,806
I've lost a lot
of you guys's trust.

789
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:25,209
Where trust in this game
is like crystal, right?

790
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:28,546
And each one of you has your
own crystal, and it's precious.

791
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,047
It's not easily given away.

792
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:34,485
And I hope that, even though
I may have dropped your crystal,

793
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,454
that you don't drop mine.

794
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,457
In a game like<i> Survivor,</i>
relational stock

795
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,759
is hard to rebuild
once it's gone.

796
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,995
It's beautiful
to pick up crystals,

797
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,297
once they've been
broken and-and dashed.

798
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,732
It's even better when you,

799
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,233
when you don't dash them,
you know?

800
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,937
JD, you seemed to get down
the minute Shan said,

801
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,640
"Yeah, it's pretty hard
to put a crystal back together."

802
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,042
Yeah, it's heartbreaking,

803
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,579
but I think
writing down my name tonight,

804
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,747
like, look at my leg,

805
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,515
will be
like scratching a mosquito bite.

806
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,351
You know, and you may feel
a little relief now,

807
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,120
but in the long run
it's gonna get a lot worse.

808
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,490
PROBST:
So, Brad, what's the good

809
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,426
that could come from this vote
when you go back to camp,

810
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,427
the four of you?

811
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,795
Jeff, if you can
make it through this,

812
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,797
what don't kill
you makes you stronger.

813
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,166
And so, once we're walking back,

814
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,101
the morale
is gonna start going back up.

815
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,704
It's bittersweet,
but it's a healthy cycle.

816
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,709
PROBST:
JD, if you're not here
and this is the end,

817
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,811
what's it been like
for seven days for JD?

818
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,579
JD:
I've said it so many times,

819
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,882
my faith and my family
are my foundation, obviously,

820
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,984
but<i> Survivor</i> built me up.

821
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,921
I went through my life
really skinny and nerdy

822
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,457
and short and-and not cool,
and I was bullied a lot.

823
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,793
And, through all of that,
I would go home

824
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,929
and I could turn on the TV
and I would watch<i> Survivor.</i>

825
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,399
And I could live vicariously
through Ozzy and Malcolm.

826
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,368
All my heroes.
I wanted to be like them.

827
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,669
Why do you think
I have this hair?

828
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,805
You know, why do you think
I wear the necklace

829
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,007
and I, like,
I quote Woo so much?

830
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,210
And without<i> Survivor,</i>
