>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,462
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,298
In the island nation of Palau,

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,758
20 new castaways began their

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,469
adventure with a big twist.

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,512
There are two immunity

7
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,181
necklaces-- one for the first

8
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,599
woman, one for the first man--

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,102
who can get to shore and claim

10
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,854
them.

11
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:21,521
Go!

12
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,105
With no other information

13
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:27,152
to guide them, the race was on.

14
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,696
Ian and Jolanda were the first

15
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,196
to claim the necklaces.

16
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,115
>> Whoo! Good job!

17
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,241
>> We're not a tribe.

18
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,534
We don't have our buffs.

19
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,994
We don't have a clue what's

20
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:36,953
happening next.

21
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,163
>> All right, see if we

22
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,372
can get this going.

23
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,165
>> PROBST: With all 20 on one

24
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,166
beach, and no fire to boil

25
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,250
water, things got even worse

26
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,544
on day two...

27
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,503
All right, Ian, take

28
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,671
a spot right over here,

29
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,714
Jolanda right over here.

30
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,673
...when the survivors finally

31
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,632
learned the value

32
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,675
of the immunity necklaces.

33
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,843
We're going to divide

34
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,719
into two tribes

35
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,678
with nine members each.

36
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,054
There are 20 of you.

37
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,181
Two people will be sent home.

38
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,974
(survivors groaning)

39
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,517
Ian and Jolanda made the first

40
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,187
of the schoolyard picks.

41
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,687
>> Katie.

42
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,105
>> Bobby Jon.

43
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,231
>> PROBST: And the two tribes

44
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,524
were chosen, one by one.

45
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,484
>> Willard.

46
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,651
>> PROBST: Willard was the last

47
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,819
member picked for the older

48
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,737
Koror Tribe.

49
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,529
>> Angie.

50
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,322
>> PROBST: And Angie was the

51
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,574
last picked for the younger

52
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,366
Ulong Tribe.

53
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,327
Jonathan and Wanda were out.

54
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,245
(cheering)

55
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,288
>> Go get 'em, Wanda!

56
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,457
>> I was really, really,

57
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,124
really sad.

58
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,668
I'm going to wipe my tears.

59
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,170
That's in the past.

60
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,505
It's a whole new game.

61
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,297
>> PROBST: All right.

62
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,548
Let's hand out the buffs.

63
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,510
Koror, you will wear brown.

64
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,302
You guys are Ulong.

65
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:38,723
You'll wear blue.

66
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,016
Survivors ready.

67
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,725
Go!

68
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,268
At the challenge, the tribes

69
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,520
competed for immunity

70
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,687
and whatever survival items

71
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,940
they chose to take.

72
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:47,482
The older Koror tribe took

73
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:51,820
only the flint to make fire...

74
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,906
>> Come on! We got to go!

75
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,949
>> PROBST: ...while Ulong

76
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:56,533
struggled with more supplies.

77
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,243
Koror is up and over.

78
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:58,535
>> Let's go!

79
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,285
>> PROBST: Koror's decision to

80
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,204
travel light secured them

81
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,247
victory...

82
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,499
Koror wins immunity and reward!

83
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,959
...and earned them the right

84
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:06,918
to choose a campsite.

85
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,086
You can either go back

86
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,003
to what you know

87
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:09,504
or you can start fresh.

88
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,005
>> New adventure.

89
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:11,881
>> PROBST: You're going to

90
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,674
take your chances.

91
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:13,883
>> We're going to take our

92
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,884
chances.

93
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,052
>> PROBST: But on the way

94
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:16,636
to their new beach, disaster

95
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,139
struck the winning Koror tribe.

96
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,641
>> Oh, my God!

97
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,934
>> All of the supplies to make

98
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:23,852
fire went straight down.

99
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,394
It was just like, "Did this

100
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,311
really happen?"

101
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,898
>> We're in a worse scenario

102
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,066
than we originally had.

103
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:31,901
>> PROBST: Back at Ulong,

104
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,444
Angie knew she was a target

105
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,280
going into Tribal Council.

106
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,698
>> You don't think I remember

107
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,074
exactly the order in which

108
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,158
we got picked for tribes?

109
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,368
The only reason we lost the

110
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,619
challenge is 'cause we didn't

111
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,787
leave soon enough.

112
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,788
>> PROBST: But Stephenie felt

113
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,998
Jolanda had held them back

114
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,623
at the challenge.

115
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,875
>> We made a dumb mistake,

116
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,376
and it's because of one person,

117
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,419
I feel.

118
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,087
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

119
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,671
Angie received three votes...

120
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,214
First person voted out

121
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,633
of Survivor: Palau...

122
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,551
...but it was Jolanda

123
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,468
who was voted out.

124
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,387
Jolanda, the tribe has spoken.

125
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,890
17 are left.

126
00:03:01,973 --> 00:04:24,931
Who will be voted out tonight?

127
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:29,978
>> Another day in paradise.

128
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:30,520
>> Today we won immunity,

129
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,689
which was fabulous.

130
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,398
We won a great reward

131
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,440
which was the flint,

132
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,651
and up until that point,

133
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,319
everything was just wonderful.

134
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,238
And of course, then there was

135
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:40,822
a turn of events with the

136
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,657
capsizing of the boat, and...

137
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,117
the flint is at the

138
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,996
bottom of the ocean,

139
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,372
so we can't even get fire.

140
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,540
>> It's a bummer and a buzz

141
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,457
kill, but like we said,

142
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,375
it was just like a car accident,

143
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:52,709
and we just got

144
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,210
to get back from it.

145
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,586
Get around the shock of it.

146
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,465
(squeaking)

147
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,926
(Janu shrieks)

148
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,220
(shrieking)

149
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,805
>> Oh, my God, there were three!

150
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,515
>> There's a lot of them...

151
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,019
>> When I first saw the rats,

152
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,353
oh, my God, saw three of them,

153
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,521
and they were just

154
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,149
(trills tongue) going to town.

155
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:16,399
(gasps)

156
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,276
I hear them.

157
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:18,818
Like, they're right behind

158
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,986
there.

159
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,154
(squeaking)

160
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,071
(gasps)

161
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,157
What?

162
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,615
>> You know what?

163
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,116
I saw something, but...

164
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,658
>> They're, like, walking

165
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,367
around.

166
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,202
They're not afraid of anything.

167
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:28,870
See? They're right there.

168
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,704
>> Ooh!

169
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,581
>> Ew!

170
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,582
>> Get out!

171
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,624
>> They're right there.

172
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,542
>> I know it's mind

173
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,752
over matter, and I know

174
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,502
if you don't mind,

175
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,253
it doesn't matter,

176
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,256
but, ooh, I mind and it matters.

177
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,424
I just can't stand those things.

178
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,842
They're huge.

179
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:47,096
Ugh!

180
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,597
>> Tom, I love the, uh,

181
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,974
the new campsite choice.

182
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,392
>> Really?

183
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,727
>> Although, do you think

184
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,062
there could be a worse island

185
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,146
than this?

186
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,689
>> Oh, I'm sure there are.

187
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,732
>> You think so?

188
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,734
>> Oh, yeah.

189
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,027
>> It wasn't safe for us

190
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,028
to choose this island.

191
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,071
It was just a quick decision

192
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,447
we made, and I-I regret that

193
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,157
we didn't think it through.

194
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,741
Tom, having taken the leader

195
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,452
role in the tribe,

196
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,454
said, "Let's go for it.

197
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,623
It's an adventure."

198
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,415
It was a rash choice made in a

199
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,294
moment that could really affect

200
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,046
the game for this tribe.

201
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:20,630
The way the whole thing came

202
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,507
down, I think Willard said, "I

203
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,842
think we should take a vote."

204
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,968
And you said, "I think

205
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,511
we should do it..."

206
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,012
>> Oh... okay.

207
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,097
>> "We-We're on for another

208
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,223
adventure, it's part of...

209
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,265
we're here for an adventure."

210
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,350
Without having...

211
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,226
>> I-I just... I'm gonna

212
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,102
disagree just because...

213
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,269
I-I thought we should go

214
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,145
back, too, and then...

215
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,188
>> You did?

216
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:37,980
>> ...three guys-- three

217
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:38,898
people-- were all saying,

218
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,066
"No, let's go to a new place.

219
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,025
We're out of coconuts."

220
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,984
>> Can we agree that

221
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,568
we should have a vote?

222
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,569
>> Definitely.

223
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,279
>> Even if it... if it's just

224
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,239
to make a decision.

225
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:46,739
Okay, okay, guys.

226
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,365
Raise your hand.

227
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,199
Who wants to go? Stay?

228
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:48,699
Raise if you want to go.

229
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,451
>> Caryn's really annoying,

230
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,955
because she has not stopped

231
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,915
talking about how this island

232
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,041
sucks and how everyone didn't

233
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,667
want to come here.

234
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,627
(thunder crashing)

235
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,546
>> Oh, no!

236
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,631
>> We only had a second to

237
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,799
decide, and the majority was,

238
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,883
like, "Let's go," you know?

239
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,968
New tribe, new camp.

240
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,718
Unfortunately,

241
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,387
it was the wrong decision.

242
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:09,846
Oh, well, we're here.

243
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,555
Get over it.

244
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:32,827
(thunder crashing)

245
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,578
>> We went to our first

246
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,495
Tribal Council,

247
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,456
and we got rid of Jo.

248
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,833
I think it was a great decision,

249
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,667
actually.

250
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,253
I think our whole team thinks

251
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,463
it, our whole tribe thinks it

252
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,923
was.

253
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,259
>> It's time to get up, y'all.

254
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:48,551
>> Mmm...

255
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,595
>> Without Jolanda around,

256
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,513
everybody's feeling good, you

257
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,514
know, 'cause there's nobody

258
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,640
telling people what to do.

259
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,392
We're not going

260
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,977
to follow a leader.

261
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,522
>> So what should we do?

262
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,524
>> Well...

263
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,609
>> Wake up first.

264
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,402
>> Yeah.

265
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:06,611
>> Yeah.

266
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,863
>> We can make our own decisions

267
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,408
and be democratic about it.

268
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,576
We're Americans, and we're going

269
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,079
to do democracy.

270
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,080
Come on, y'all.

271
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,082
Gather around.

272
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,167
>> See what we got.

273
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:21,626
>> You ready?

274
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,627
>> Yeah.

275
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,795
Get your ass up here, Ibrehem.

276
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,463
>> All right.

277
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,006
>> I hear you.

278
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,424
>> Maybe not.

279
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,508
(chuckles)

280
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,551
>> Go ahead, Bobby.

281
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,552
>> "Keep on your toes

282
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,179
while making this run.

283
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,263
"Your rivals will seek

284
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,224
to spoil your fun.

285
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,099
"You'll, too, have the chance

286
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:37,767
to spoil their mood.

287
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,060
Stay out of the water,

288
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,353
and you may catch more food."

289
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:40,895
>> I think we might fight

290
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:41,729
people.

291
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,482
>> Yeah, we're gonna... yeah.

292
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,650
>> I'm not quite sure

293
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,985
of my game plan yet.

294
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:48,778
I know that obviously there are

295
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,990
people who did vote for me,

296
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:53,783
and so, uh, I just want

297
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,617
to make myself

298
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,119
a valuable asset to this tribe.

299
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,996
If I don't, I'll probably

300
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,290
be on the chopping block again.

301
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,548
>> PROBST: Come on in.

302
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,759
Take a spot on the mat.

303
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,804
We'll now bring in Ulong.

304
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,555
Jolanda voted out at the first

305
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,809
Tribal Council.

306
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,977
Koror, how's the fire

307
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,270
working out?

308
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,771
>> It's not too good.

309
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,648
We capsized yesterday.

310
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,817
>> We just kind of lost it.

311
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,112
>> PROBST: You lost your fire?

312
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,739
That made Jeff really happy.

313
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,825
>> As well it should.

314
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,493
>> We're going to find it.

315
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,911
We're the Bad News Bears, man.

316
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,121
Our back's against the wall,

317
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:40,788
and we're coming on strong.

318
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,789
>> PROBST: You guys ready

319
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,832
for today's challenge?

320
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,624
>> Yeah.

321
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,750
>> PROBST: It is for reward.

322
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,751
Here's how it works.

323
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,254
You will attempt to cross

324
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,214
a balance obstacle course.

325
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:50,798
Moving one tribe member at a

326
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,633
time, you'll begin by swinging

327
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,718
over a trench.

328
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,928
You'll then make your way

329
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,346
over three rolling drums,

330
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,431
across a balance beam

331
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,016
and over a wobbly bridge.

332
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,434
Finally, you're going to cross

333
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,393
a rope bridge where' you'll

334
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,478
retrieve a flag and make your

335
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,564
way back to the start.

336
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,023
Along the way, members

337
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,733
of the other tribe are going to

338
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,401
try to knock you off by

339
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,861
swinging heavy bags of sand.

340
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,945
First tribe to collect

341
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:13,946
ten flags wins reward.

342
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,448
If at any time you're knocked

343
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,949
off the course or you fall off

344
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,242
the course, go back to the

345
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:18,659
start.

346
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,661
Each tribe will assign

347
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,121
two members to be in charge

348
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,247
of swinging the heavy bags.

349
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,623
Only rule: everyone has to cross

350
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,916
the rope swing at least once.

351
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,126
Make sense?

352
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,544
>> Yeah.

353
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,086
>> PROBST: Want to know what

354
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:29,754
you're playing for?

355
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,713
>> Yeah.

356
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,882
>> PROBST: If you can't get food

357
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,759
with this, you don't deserve

358
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,053
to be out here.

359
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:37,803
>> Oh, hell, yeah!

360
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,846
Come on, man.

361
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,556
>> PROBST: Mask and snorkel,

362
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,224
fins...

363
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,893
>> Oh... Yes.

364
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,935
>> PROBST: ...spear.

365
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,103
>> I love you, Jeff.

366
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,063
>> PROBST: In addition, Ulong,

367
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,731
since you haven't won it yet,

368
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,690
you're playing for flint.

369
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,777
>> You the man.

370
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,487
>> PROBST: Koror, who are going

371
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,654
to be the two people responsible

372
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,113
for swinging the bags?

373
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:56,739
>> Myself and Gregg.

374
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,574
>> PROBST: Tom and Gregg.

375
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,283
Ulong?

376
00:10:59,367 --> 00:10:59,825
Jeff and Ibrehem.

377
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,826
Okay, Koror, you have

378
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,578
one extra member.

379
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,371
You're sitting somebody out.

380
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:03,954
You cannot sit out the same

381
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:04,997
person in back-to-back

382
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,289

00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,067
(yelling)

572
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,235
And he beats himself up

573
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,153
as a reward.

574
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,114
Ulong with eight flags.

575
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,283
Janu worn out.

576
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,077
Stephenie back on the course.

577
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,578
Stephenie... Whoa, whoa!

578
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,205
>> Good job.

579
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,289
>> Beat her there,

580
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,540
beat her there, Janu.

581
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,625
>> PROBST: Janu and Steph

582
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,209
on the rope bridge.

583
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,044
Janu has another flag.

584
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,129
Steph has a flag.

585
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,383
Janu working the barrels.

586
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,300
>> Come on, Janu,

587
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,678
you're almost there now.

588
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,679
>> You got it, Janu.

589
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,638
>> You got it, Steph.

590
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:12,888
Come on!

591
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:13,639
>> Go, Steph!

592
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,723
>> PROBST: Janu across with

593
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,224
a flag for Koror.

594
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,016
Stephenie's across

595
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,937
with flag number nine.

596
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,397
9-3. Ulong leads.

597
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,816
Ulong needs only one more flag.

598
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,236
Kim could be the winner.

599
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,947
At stake: fishing gear and fire

600
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,073
for Ulong.

601
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,241
Ian has another flag.

602
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,034
Kim has a flag.

603
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,119
Both heading back.

604
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,954
>> Stay low, Kim.

605
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,205
>> PROBST: Tom, ooh, just

606
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,206
misses.

607
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,124
>> You got it, Kim.

608
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,125
>> Good job, Kim.

609
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,459
>> PROBST: Koror with four

610
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,877
if he can hang on,

611
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,880
and he doesn't.

612
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,965
(cheering)

613
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,091
Kim is this close to victory

614
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,260
for Ulong, and she's across.

615
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,762
(cheering)

616
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,889
Ulong wins reward!

617
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,268
>> Good job.

618
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,020
>> PROBST: Ulong, nice job.

619
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:02,312
Here's fire.

620
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,690
Who wants it?

621
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,274
(whooping)

622
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,609
>> PROBST: You now have fishing

623
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,736
gear and fire.

624
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,653
It should completely

625
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,195
change life at your camp.

626
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,114
Koror, I know what you're doing

627
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,283
this afternoon.

628
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,743
You're looking for that flint.

629
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,787
Head back to camp.

630
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,603
(all whooping)

631
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,604
>> Oh, my God.

632
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,480
That was so awesome.

633
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,439
>> We need to go catch us

634
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:45,689
some fish.

635
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,273
>> Hell, yeah.

636
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,192
>> I want to get some water.

637
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,443
>> 16 fish would be good

638
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:49,818
for us tonight.

639
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,987
>> After winning the flint

640
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,197
and the sling and the snorkel

641
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,615
and mask and fins,

642
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,866
now we can eat.

643
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,366
Now we can actually have

644
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,117
some protein.

645
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,243
>> Angie!

646
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,328
>> I'm tougher...

647
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,287
>> Motivated us all, girl.

648
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,330
>> When people think...

649
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,123
I know I am.

650
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,792
Everybody was like, "Wow, you

651
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,417
did so great, you did so great."

652
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,753
And I was like, "Oh, my God,

653
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,879
I needed this so badly."

654
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:09,505
This is exactly what I needed.

655
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,757
I was like, I was ready to cry

656
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,341
'cause I was just so relieved.

657
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,009
>> She... she showed

658
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:14,343
me something.

659
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,136
>> I definitely judged Angie

660
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,304
way too quickly.

661
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,680
She went into a challenge

662
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,681
and dominated.

663
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,141
I mean, completely dominated.

664
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,559
I don't know what got into her,

665
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,310
but it was good

666
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,645
and it totally changed

667
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,395
the whole morale

668
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,272
of our whole tribe.

669
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,818
(murmuring)

670
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,902
>> Oh!

671
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,861
>> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

672
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,862
Yeah!

673
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,863
>> Oh, my God.

674
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,823
We're gonna drink water.

675
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,949
Oh, my God.

676
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:37,324
>> I love fire.

677
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,451
It makes me want to cry.

678
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,829
>> The second we got fire

679
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,372
started, I wanted to try and see

680
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,206
if we could catch some fish.

681
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,750
Maybe even go explore and see

682
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,379
what's all around us.

683
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,682
(laughing)

684
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,641
(laughing)

685
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,517
>> There's got to

686
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,434
be bigger fish somewhere.

687
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,644
>> I saw some big ones

688
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,478
in there, dude.

689
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,396
>> Well, at least we know

690
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,355
that if there are some

691
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,523
big fish, we can get them.

692
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,024
You know, I didn't get a whole

693
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,109
lot, but I got enough

694
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,277
so that everybody could have a

695
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,071
couple of pinches of protein.

696
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,326
>> Are you serious, bro?

697
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,537
>> That's what I'm talking

698
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,623
about, Jeff, bring in the bacon.

699
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,958
>> Being well-fed and

700
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,751
well-nourished is the huge

701
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,335
advantage at the next immunity

702
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,170
challenge.

703
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,422
I'm happy that they don't have

704
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,756
their flint, and I hope

705
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,050
they don't find it.

706
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,393
>> We're getting our flint

707
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,394
and steel.

708
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,021
We dropped the box,

709
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,398
and we gotta go find it today.

710
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,233
>> We went out at the absolute

711
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,401
worst time,

712
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,944
and the current was ripping

713
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,029
like I've never seen

714
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,238
the ocean tide rip.

715
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,032
It was like, almost like being

716
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:00,532
in a fast-moving river.

717
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,242
We were paddling as fast

718
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,911
as we could and just barely

719
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,078
holding position.

720
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:05,454
Come on, Ian!

721
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,290
>> Give him the anchor. Go!

722
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,583
On your right.

723
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,751
>> You've got to keep paddling.

724
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,835
>> I don't know if

725
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,962
we were that far over.

726
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:14,922
>> I don't think

727
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,214
it was that far over.

728
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,007
>> But I do think

729
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,133
it was slightly that way.

730
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,719
They're going to be so

731
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,803
disappointed when they come

732
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,513
back, if they don't get it.

733
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,473
>> Okay, I see it, I see it,

734
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,808
I see it.

735
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,060
(screams excitedly)

736
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,102
Don't lose the spot.

737
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:29,519
Don't lose the spot.

738
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,979
We're drifting.

739
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:31,730
It was definitely

740
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,356
the strongest current

741
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,899
I've ever faced in my life.

742
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,025
And the box

743
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,151
was about 25 feet down.

744
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:36,902
We tried everything;

745
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,278
we tried hooking the anchor

746
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,988
into the handle on the box

747
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,531
and bring it up, that up,

748
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:41,990
but it kept slipping.

749
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:42,407
>> Got it?

750
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,201
(Ian grunts)

751
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:44,743
>> I feel like I lost it.

752
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,285
>> Do you see it?

753
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,329
>> As I got more and more tired,

754
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,288
it became more and more

755
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,581
difficult to get to the bottom,

756
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,582
became more and more difficult

757
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,541
to tread water.

758
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,168
So, there were a couple of times

759
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:53,669
when I was like, "Okay,

760
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,336
"you know, I'm underwater;

761
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,047
I don't know if I'm going to be

762
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,175
able to make it."

763
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:00,634
I had it hooked again.

764
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,260
You see it?

765
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,220
>> That it right there?

766
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,721
>> I saw it when I just

767
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,807
scratched the box.

768
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,357
>> I got it!

769
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,859
Hey, guys, just bring it over

770
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,485
quick, please.

771
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:24,574
Hurry.

772
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,952
Yeah!

773
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:31,540
(screams excitedly)

774
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,208
(yells and laughs)

775
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,126
>> Ah-ha-ha!

776
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:34,751
>> Yeah!

777
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,502
>> Yay!

778
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,336
(cheering)

779
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,879
>> Yay!

780
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,298
(screaming jubilantly)

781
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:39,881
>> Getting the box

782
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,008
and having it was like,

783
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,134
I mean, it was like

784
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:42,926
running the marathon

785
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,927
and winning first place.

786
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,262
Once we got it into the boat,

787
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:45,887
it was like, man, it was like

788
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,472
holding on to a big piece

789
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,682
of gold.

790
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,017
(laughing)

791
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,935
(whooping)

792
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,353
>> Nice job, Gregg.

793
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,772
(laughing)

794
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,565
(laughing elatedly)

795
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,775
>> It's one of the happiest

796
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,901
moments of my life.

797
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,236
It was definitely a high

798
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,070
for all of us.

799
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:02,738
And even though

800
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,739
we lost the challenge,

801
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,906
it really felt like

802
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,908
we won the day.

803
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,035
>> Come on, fire.

804
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,119
>> Okay, okay, blow.

805
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,078
Don't blow too hard.

806
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,746
>> Oh, my God.

807
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,622
(indistinct voices)

808
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,749
(clapping)

809
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,374
>> Good job, guys.

810
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,960
>> A group effort, right there.

811
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,587
>> Isn't that beautiful?

812
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,088
>> I'm so proud of you guys.

813
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,548
>> A good day. A good day.

814
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,633
We can be proud.

815
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,104
>> We got a lot of clam.

816
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:36,605
>> Look at all of them.

817
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,522
>> You want just to cook it all?

818
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,941
>> Yeah. Yeah.

819
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,859
>> You know, I hate clams, but

820
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,194
I know this is going to be good.

821
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,111
>> Yeah. I haven't had

822
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:43,737
giant clam before.

823
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,821
>> Well, first time for

824
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,989
everything, right?

825
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:46,448
>> Tonight is gonna be

826
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,284
our first time we had fire,

827
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:49,826
our first time we have water

828
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,494
and our first time we're eating

829
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,329
in four days

830
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,371
since we've been here.

831
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,122
We're all famished

832
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,957
and we're ready to chow down.

833
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,500
>> Oh, my God, it's so good.

834
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,626
How's the seaweed?

835
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,045
>> Oh, my God.

836
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:00,796
You know what?

837
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,588
We can't complain

838
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,005
right now, for real.

839
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,048
>> Oh, I know.

840
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:03,673
>> Hell, no.

841
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,883
>> We haven't eaten in four

842
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,051
days.

843
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,552
>> We, for the first night,

844
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,762
had actual food besides

845
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,347
coconuts.

846
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,517
Ashlee didn't want any of it.

847
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,645
>> You don't like clam?

848
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,438
>> The way we're gonna

849
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,981
advance ourselves

850
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,233
is be a strong team

851
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,192
all the way through,

852
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,401
and if we have someone

853
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,069
slowing us down,

854
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:24,569
I hope that that doesn't

855
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,573
bring down our team.

856
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,034
>> Ashlee went into the shelter,

857
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,202
and she went to sleep.

858
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,079
This fire was a big, big thing,

859
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,205
and she should have

860
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,289
came outside and just

861
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:36,665
kind of sat there.

862
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,416
Sometimes we do things

863
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:38,834
we don't want to do,

864
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,044
but it's just things you need

865
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,462
to do, 'cause we are a tribe

866
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,922
here and, you know, people will

867
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:44,965
get voted off this tribe

868
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,093
in this game we're playing.

869
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,555
>> I'm passing out.

870
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,806
>> I'm fighting to stay

871
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,515
awake right now.

872
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,850
>> Yeah, I-I think I'm gonna...

873
00:23:54,933 --> 00:24:03,233
I'm gonna crash.

874
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,068
>> Kim's been snuggling on Jeff

875
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,988
a lot, and I'm not

876
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:08,947
quite sure how that...

877
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,407
if she's playing him or not.

878
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,366
I mean, two-people alliance

879
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:11,867
is a very strong alliance,

880
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,702
and so I'm not sure

881
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,703
if they're kind of

882
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,620
buddying up to make an alliance.

883
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,497
And so I'm kind of waiting to

884
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:32,971
see how that all will play out.

885
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,181
>> Oh, look.

886
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,016
>> What do you think it is?

887
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,560
>> Dishes. Military dishes.

888
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,604
It's a code.

889
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,522
Lear... Learn.

890
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,191
>> T...

891
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:44,649
>> "Learn this."

892
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,026
It's "Learn this."

893
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:46,735
We need to learn this code.

894
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,945
Hey, guys!

895
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,113
>> Guys, we got tree mail.

896
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,740
>> It's Morse Code.

897
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,450
>> The tree mail just came

898
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:53,909
and we're about to all

899
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,118
learn Morse Code.

900
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,203
Right now, we've all

901
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:56,745
broken it off into sections,

902
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,537
'cause there's eight people.

903
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,663
We don't know if that's

904
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,540
a good strategy or not,

905
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,458
but we think it's

906
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,417
the best one we got.

907
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,793
Does anybody want to quiz me?

908
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,420
>> All right, W?

909
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,214
>> Dot-dash-dash.

910
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,506
>> Winning the other day

911
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,341
definitely gave us

912
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,800
a confidence boost,

913
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,135
but we're going to have

914
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:12,969
an immunity challenge here,

915
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,138
and we got to win that, too.

916
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,156
>> PROBST: All right, first

917
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,740
things first.

918
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:39,704
Give it up, Caryn.

919
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,914
Immunity back up for grabs.

920
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,791
Ready to get to today's

921
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,833
challenge?

922
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:44,793
>> Yep.

923
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,086
>> Yes.

924
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:46,836
>> PROBST: You received

925
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,754
tree mail this morning.

926
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:48,880
It said learn Morse Code.

927
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,589
I hope you did.

928
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,424
On my "go," you'll swim out

929
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,425
to a floating platform.

930
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:52,968
You'll dive down ten feet,

931
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,594
where you'll find a rope

932
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,804
that's strung through a barrel

933
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,014
and attached to a footlocker

934
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,016
that is 50 feet away.

935
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,433
While underwater,

936
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,519
you're gonna pull on a rope,

937
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,271
and as you do you'll bring that

938
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,313
footlocker closer and closer.

939
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,398
Every ten feet, a marker buoy

940
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,483
will pop up showing you

941
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,818
how far you have to go.

942
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,986
Once you've released all five

943
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,611
buoys, that footlocker will be

944
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,738
right in front of you.

945
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,823
You can open it.

946
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,617
Eight mess kits will pop up.

947
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,035
Bring them back with you to

948
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,288
shore, you'll then use the Morse

949
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,622
Code painted on the mess kits

950
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,666
to decode a hidden word.

951
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,750
First tribe to solve

952
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,294
the puzzle wins immunity.

953
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,378
Safe from the vote.

954
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,630
For the losers, a trip

955
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,090
to Tribal Council, you will vote

956
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,591
one member out of your tribe.

957
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,634
Make sense?

958
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,012
Koror, you have one extra

959
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,013
member-- got to sit somebody

960
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,014
out; you cannot sit out the same

961
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,848
person.

962
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:40,765
Willard sat out in the last

963
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,725
challenge.

964
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,142
Katie. All right.

965
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,810
Everybody else take your spots.

966
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,771
Wait for my "go."

967
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,650
Here we go. For immunity.

968
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,818
Survivors ready.

969
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,654
Go!

970
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,614
All eight have to get to the

971
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,116
pontoon before you can dive

972
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,493
down.

973
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,536
Got to have everybody

974
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,704
at the pontoon before you

975
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,788
can start pulling on the rope.

976
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,790
Willard falling behind.

977
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,710
(indistinct talking)

978
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,296
Ulong, go down.

979
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,840
>> Go. Go.

980
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,348
>> PROBST: Koror has to wait.

981
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,432
They cannot begin until

982
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:27,062
Willard gets to the pontoon.

983
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,439
Ulong getting a big head start.

984
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:33,818
Steph heading down.

985
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,861
>> Let's go.

986
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,236
Come on, Willard.

987
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:35,820
Let's get him, pull him up.

988
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,114
>> PROBST: Go, Koror.

989
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:44,371
Coby, Tom going down together.

990
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,457
Both tribes underwater.

991
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,338
Ulong making progress.

992
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:57,008
They're only 40 feet away now.

993
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,602
Tom made up a lot of ground

994
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,229
on that.

995
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,315
Angie's heading down.

996
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,576
Ian and Tom, going down

997
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,329
together.

998
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,374
Koror has a buddy system.

999
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,883
>> PROBST: Koror with the lead.

1000
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,301
>> Got 'em on the run.

1001
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,052
Let's go.

1002
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,137
>> PROBST: Ashlee going down

1003
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,599
for Ulong.

1004
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,602
>> Aah!

1005
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,942
>> You guys ready to go?

1006
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:56,776
Ready to go next?

1007
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,571
>> PROBST: Kim, hanging on.

1008
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,657
Tom heading down for Koror.

1009
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,122
Koror pulling ahead.

1010
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:09,914
Jeff taking a good long rest;

1011
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,084
he heads back down.

1012
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,801
Jeff not down very long.

1013
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,971
Ibrehem also right back up.

1014
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,184
Koror, getting that footlocker

1015
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,311
closer and closer.

1016
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:31,895
Only ten feet to go.

1017
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,854
>> Guys, we're way ahead.

1018
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,690
>> PROBST: Ulong falling behind.

1019
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:36,191
>> We gotta keep going.

1020
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:36,983
We gotta keep going.

1021
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,068
>> PROBST: Kim, the only one who

1022
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:39,986
has not been down for Ulong.

1023
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,280
Steph heading back down.

1024
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,040
Ulong with a lot of ground

1025
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,082
to still make up.

1026
00:29:53,166 --> 00:30:00,507
Ian heading down for Koror.

1027
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,052
Koror's got their trunk.

1028
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,262
Got to open your trunk

1029
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,015
and release the mess kits.

1030
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,850
Ian releases the locker.

1031
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,977
It's open.

1032
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,062
Koror has to unclip

1033
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,855
eight mess kits.

1034
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,775
>> I got two here.

1035
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:19,359
>> PROBST: Let's go, Ulong.

1036
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:23,154
Immunity at stake.

1037
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,079
Ulong still struggling to get

1038
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,664
their footlocker to them.

1039
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,414
We got 'em all.

1040
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,082
We got 'em all.

1041
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:34,415
Go!

1042
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,000
Koror has all eight mess kits.

1043
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,085
They're heading into shore

1044
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,129
to solve the puzzle.

1045
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,262
>> All right, guys, you got

1046
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,557
this!

1047
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,272
>> PROBST: You're good.

1048
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,358
Take off the burlap.

1049
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,067
>> "Immunity."

1050
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,152
Did you see...?

1051
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,071
>> PROBST: Let's go, Ulong!

1052
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:09,242
>> Come on!

1053
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:12,537
>> I...

1054
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,246
>> Y...

1055
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:13,663
>> I...

1056
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:13,913
>> I...

1057
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,414
>> T...

1058
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,790
>> Use the other "I."

1059
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:16,749
>> No, "M" is...

1060
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,625
"M" is dash, dash...

1061
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,001
>> Dash, dash...

1062
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:18,585
>> M...

1063
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:18,918
>> Willard...

1064
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,753
>> That's not...

1065
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:20,962
>> Yes.

1066
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:21,588
>> Check it.

1067
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,880
>> You sure?

1068
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,632
>> Check it.

1069
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,174
>> PROBST: Koror...

1070
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,134
(cheering)

1071
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,802
wins immunity!

1072
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:30,930
(cheering)

1073
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,024
(cheering continues)

1074
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,992
Koror, congratulations.

1075
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,744
Nobody going home

1076
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,787
from your tribe.

1077
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,955
Ulong, good effort.

1078
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,124
Sorry to say, another visit

1079
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,375
to Tribal Council.

1080
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,835
Another tribe member going home.

1081
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:01,336
Up to you to figure out

1082
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,795
who that's gonna be.

1083
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,173
Head on back to camp.

1084
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,189
>> When we lost the challenge

1085
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,358
today, everybody was so

1086
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,069
disappointed, and to make

1087
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,614
matters worse, it was raining,

1088
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,156
so our main priority was,

1089
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,533
oh, crap, I hope our fire

1090
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,286
didn't burn out.

1091
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,287
>> Get this.

1092
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,497
>> Luckily, we were able to

1093
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,125
scoop up any hot coals that we

1094
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,379
could and rushed to a cave.

1095
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,713
>> Let's go to that cave

1096
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,547
down yonder.

1097
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,590
>> What cave?

1098
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,134
Cave down here we have to go to.

1099
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:54,389
>> They're behind us...

1100
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,976
There we go.

1101
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,602
>> There it is.

1102
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,353
>> We're good.

1103
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,896
>> Just run and go back and work

1104
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:02,730
on everything else.

1105
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,565
There you go.

1106
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,026
>> What do you want to do?

1107
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,902
You want to stay here or you

1108
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,569
want to go help?

1109
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,320
Both of us can't stay.

1110
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,029
>> Oh, dude, no.

1111
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,656
>> Ange, are you staying?

1112
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,365
>> I'll stay.

1113
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,574
I'll stay if you want

1114
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,492
to go back to camp.

1115
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,453
We can... whatever you want.

1116
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:24,585
>> I talked to Ashlee a little

1117
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,003
bit.

1118
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:26,713
>> Yeah.

1119
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,131
>> And I told her pretty much

1120
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,632
that, you know, I was down

1121
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,217
with any sort of alliance

1122
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,343
'cause you guys really pulled

1123
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,344
through for me last time.

1124
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,554
>> I know.

1125
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,680
>> Kim's not pulling her weight

1126
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,765
as much as everybody else.

1127
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,102
>> At the immunity challenge,

1128
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,520
Kim didn't want to help

1129
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:46,399
the team pull that chest.

1130
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,942
So I'll tell you how it's going

1131
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:48,276
to happen.

1132
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,402
Kim is gone.

1133
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,738
>> Oh, yeah, for sure.

1134
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,156
>> And it's obvious to me

1135
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,199
you're attracted to Kim, okay?

1136
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:59,078
And right now, psychologically,

1137
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,749
sociologically, I'm seeing Kim

1138
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,792
as a threat, you know?

1139
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,293
>> Yeah. I just... I mean,

1140
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,210
I was thinking Ashlee,

1141
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,128
to be honest.

1142
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,298
She's-She's breaking down, man.

1143
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,132
I can see it.

1144
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,425
I mean, I can tell

1145
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,926
she's breaking down.

1146
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,094
>> She's not a threat,

1147
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,512
though, at the moment.

1148
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,180
>> James is definitely rubbing

1149
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,056
me the wrong way.

1150
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,599
He doesn't have the right

1151
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,809
to come to me and say, "Oh,

1152
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,603
listen, it's Kim over Ashlee."

1153
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,021
Well, not to me it's not.

1154
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,732
Ashlee has kind of changed

1155
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,692
her frame of mind.

1156
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,235
I can see her slowing down.

1157
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,946
I mean at this point, let's vote

1158
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,493
off our weakest link.

1159
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,827
>> Hey, Steph.

1160
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,536
>> What?

1161
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,287
>> After kinda like thinking,

1162
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,500
I think we push Ashlee.

1163
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,501
>> Yeah?

1164
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,168
>> I mean, just being honest

1165
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,085
with you.

1166
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:48,753
>> Honestly, Kim and Ashlee

1167
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,462
are just...

1168
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,630
they're about right here.

1169
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,255
You know, one's up, one's down.

1170
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,131
One's up, one's down.

1171
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,217
So you gotta go with your gut

1172
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,509
instinct.

1173
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,219
>> But I'm telling you that we

1174
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,804
need to break her and Jeff up

1175
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,179
because...

1176
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,180
>> I don't see what's wrong

1177
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,306
with that, really, right now.

1178
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,851
>> You don't?

1179
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,852
But if they stay together,

1180
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:05,686
they're going to go.

1181
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,312
They're going to go to the end.

1182
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,732
>> Mm, not necessarily.

1183
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,858
>> I mean, she didn't even

1184
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,692
try at the challenge.

1185
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,318
She stood up there.

1186
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:12,527
>> Yeah.

1187
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,904
>> She wouldn't go down in the

1188
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:15,655
water.

1189
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,239
The bottom line is we have to

1190
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,115
think of who's going to be

1191
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:18,699
better for the team right now

1192
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,409
so we don't have to go back

1193
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,202
to Tribal Council.

1194
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,454
Angie, myself, James and

1195
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,498
Ashlee still want to vote Kim

1196
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:25,665
off.

1197
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,458
Bobby Jon is undecided.

1198
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,584
So it's a complete mess,

1199
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,544
because actually, now

1200
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,795
it looks like four people

1201
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:31,879
are voting against Kim

1202
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:32,839
and four people are voting

1203
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,631
against Ashlee,

1204
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,132
so we're going to have a tie.

1205
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:35,967
I don't even know

1206
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,134
what happens in a tie.

1207
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,135
>> What are you doing?

1208
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:38,719
>> Dude, I don't even know.

1209
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,139
>> I don't know now.

1210
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,140
>> Is it me?

1211
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,726
>> Between you and Ashlee.

1212
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,478
>> Really? Who said me?

1213
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,106
>> It's, like, the consensus.

1214
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,148
Everybody.

1215
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:51,566
>> I want to know.

1216
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,526
If I'm going to get voted off,

1217
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,944
I want somebody to tell me

1218
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,195
that they're voting for me,

1219
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,488
and I will respect the people

1220
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:57,905
a heck of a lot more

1221
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:58,447
if they can just be, like,

1222
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,032
"Yes, I'm voting for you."

1223
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:00,783
I don't want to frickin' go

1224
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,576
home.

1225
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,243
I don't think I should have to

1226
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,579
go home.

1227
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,497
But, J, look at me.

1228
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,373
I want you to swear to God

1229
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,291
that you'll tell me if you're

1230
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,292
going to vote for me.

1231
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,168
>> I'll tell you.

1232
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:11,669
>> Okay.

1233
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:15,423
>> I promise, okay?

1234
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,592
>> Bobby Jon wasn't sure.

1235
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,259
He thinks it's gonna be you,

1236
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,261
but...

1237
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,222
I'm totally not thinking,

1238
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,600
like, smart at all.

1239
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,601
>> Well, maybe they're trying to

1240
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,102
do the same thing we're doing.

1241
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:28,603
Those four in an alliance,

1242
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,354
and then if one of us goes,

1243
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,230
we're going to be picked off

1244
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:31,522
one by one.

1245
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,274
>> I really think it's going

1246
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,359
to end up in a tie if everybody

1247
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,319
sticks to where they're at right

1248
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:36,485
now.

1249
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,196
Obviously, you can't assume

1250
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,781
anything in this game.

1251
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,908
So they might do something

1252
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,242
totally different, and I don't

1253
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,329
know.

1254
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,608
>> PROBST: Very subdued faces.

1255
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,651
Tribal Council wasn't fun the

1256
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,443
first time.

1257
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,319
Not going to be any

1258
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,529
more enjoyable tonight.

1259
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,948
Well, first, let's start with

1260
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,491
some of the good things.

1261
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,826
Angie, from where I sit,

1262
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,828
an amazing turnaround,

1263
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,996
considering you were last

1264
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,331
picked, thought you were nearly

1265
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,791
out of this tribe, and then we

1266
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,416
we get to this reward challenge

1267
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,835
and you dominated.

1268
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,253
Was there an impact with the

1269
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:36,837
tribe?

1270
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,047
Did they recognize that?

1271
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,715
>> I think that they did

1272
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,424
recognize.

1273
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,218
I think that when somebody was

1274
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,678
saying that I was a physical

1275
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,346
weak link, I think that kind of

1276
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,973
got into the heads of other

1277
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,140
people, even though it wasn't

1278
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,016
necessarily true.

1279
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,059
>> PROBST: Well, here's the good

1280
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:50,601
news.

1281
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,352
You did win the reward

1282
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:51,602
challenge.

1283
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,730
And with that came fishing gear

1284
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,481
and fire.

1285
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,441
The bad news of what's happened

1286
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,567
over the last couple of days,

1287
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,194
you lost another immunity

1288
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:00,820
challenge.

1289
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,946
Kim, what was the reaction

1290
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,155
when you got back to camp,

1291
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:03,739
knowing you were going to come

1292
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,448
back to Tribal Council

1293
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,449
and vote somebody out?

1294
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,785
>> I think it was actually

1295
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,828
total devastation.

1296
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,829
I mean, we've become

1297
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,122
really, really close.

1298
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:11,706
I don't think you're prepared

1299
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,373
for how quickly

1300
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,583
you bond with people.

1301
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,502
I mean, I... at home you never

1302
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,421
feel this way after, what, six

1303
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,714
days with somebody?

1304
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,465
But we rely on each other so

1305
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,759
much.

1306
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,427
>> PROBST: Jeff.

1307
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,721
Any friendships?

1308
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,931
Flirting? Adversaries?

1309
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,891
Give me something.

1310
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,810
>> Honestly, Kim and I have

1311
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:33,978
gotten to know each other

1312
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:34,562
a little bit more than I think

1313
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,354
I've gotten to know

1314
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,564
some of the other girls.

1315
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,233
>> PROBST: Kim, when did you

1316
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,943
feel the first initial seeds

1317
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,153
of any attraction?

1318
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,237
>> It's hot in here all of a

1319
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,738
sudden.

1320
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,114
(laughter)

1321
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:45,781
>> PROBST: Day one?

1322
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,907
>> Actually, yes, it was day

1323
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,616
one.

1324
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,409
Because I couldn't sleep

1325
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,328
and he was staying up, so...

1326
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,371
>> PROBST: Steph.

1327
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,497
Have you noticed Jeff and Kim?

1328
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,125
>> Yeah, they hang out a lot.

1329
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,543
They cuddle.

1330
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,836
>> We've all noticed.

1331
00:38:58,919 --> 00:38:59,462
>> All jokes aside, it really is

1332
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,672
nice to have someone laying next

1333
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,798
to you when you're cold.

1334
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,549
It's a big difference.

1335
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,760
>> PROBST: The problem with

1336
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,344
that, Jeff, is you get into a

1337
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:07,803
game that is based on

1338
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,764
social relationships and it's

1339
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,223
about voting and numbers.

1340
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,433
>> I see that completely,

1341
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,976
but I think everybody here

1342
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,187
understands that there's no

1343
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:20,357
alliances being built here.

1344
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,525
>> PROBST: Kim, obviously, you

1345
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,651
must feel the same way.

1346
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,986
>> Under my observations,

1347
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,570
I hope that they understand

1348
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,571
that it's not... I mean, it's

1349
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,530
never crossed my mind that

1350
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,699
that's going to change anything

1351
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,658
or influence anything.

1352
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,077
>> PROBST: It's never crossed

1353
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,660
your mind that they might look

1354
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,536
and say... "Well..."?

1355
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,373
>> Not until now.

1356
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:35,873
Really, in all honesty.

1357
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,583
>> PROBST: James.

1358
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,501
What are you basing your vote on

1359
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:38,751
tonight?

1360
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,128
>> I got my mind made up.

1361
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,755
It's somebody that I think can't

1362
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,173
hang with the rest of us,

1363
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,301
they're lagging and they're...

1364
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:50,179
ready to go home.

1365
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:50,846
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1366
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,055
vote.

1367
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,724
Steph, you're up.

1368
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:09,532
>> Ashlee was the one that

1369
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,159
picked me to be on this tribe,

1370
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,911
so I just feel like I have to be

1371
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:17,164
somewhat loyal to her right now.

1372
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,468
>> I'm a man of my word,

1373
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,762
and plus, you just bug

1374
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,182
the hell out of me.

1375
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,530
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1376
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,033
votes.

1377
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,254
Once the votes are read, the

1378
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,046
decision is final.

1379
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,381
The person voted out will be

1380
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:07,882
asked to leave the Tribal

1381
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:08,716
Council area immediately.

1382
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,719
I'll read the votes.

1383
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,097
First vote...

1384
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,559
...Kim.

1385
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,643
Ashlee.

1386
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:24,356
One vote Kim; one vote Ashlee.

1387
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,065
Jeff.

1388
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,152
One vote Kim; one vote Ashlee;

1389
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,988
one vote Jeff.

1390
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:35,659
Ashlee. It's two votes Ashlee.

1391
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,411
Ashlee.

1392
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,413
That's three votes Ashlee;

1393
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:43,667
one vote Kim; one vote Jeff.

1394
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,085
Second person voted

1395
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:45,669
out of<i> Survivor: Palau:</i>

1396
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,254
Ashlee.

1397
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,881
Based on the votes cast,

1398
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:49,632
four is enough.

1399
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,927
You need to bring me your torch.

1400
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,560
Ashlee, the tribe has spoken.

1401
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,647
It's time for you to go.

1402
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:14,657
Well, I sense that tonight's

1403
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,492
vote was tough.

1404
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,826
I do believe you guys are a

1405
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,661
tight tribe with a lot of good

1406
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,787
energy, but my take?

1407
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,915
Get a clear goal first,

1408
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,792
then harness that energy.

1409
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,167
Grab your torches.

1410
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,377
Head back to camp.

1411
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,462
Good night.

1412
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:41,976
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1413
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,103
from our next episode.

1414
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,899
>> PROBST: Next time on

1415
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:49,733
<i>Survivor:</i>

1416
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,735
>> They're coming closer.

1417
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,820
>> PROBST: Koror goes hunting.

1418
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:57,032
>> There he is.

1419
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:57,658
>> PROBST: Ulong faces a

1420
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:57,866
setback.

1421
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,827
>> I can barely put any weight

1422
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,160
on it right now.

1423
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,787
>> Everything I say,

1424
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,622
you have some snotty remark...

1425
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:04,623
>> PROBST: And Caryn and Katie

1426
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,249
have it out.

1427
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,250
>> Get off me!

1428
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,336
>> She's completely lost it.

1429
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,758
>> I'm just so incredibly

1430
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,261
grateful to have had this

1431
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,470
opportunity.

1432
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,430
I'm not surprised

1433
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:19,888
by the votes tonight.

1434
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,807
I think that they all sensed

1435
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,476
I was ready to go home.

1436
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,644
The only regret I have

1437
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,062
is that I did not use

1438
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,647
the excuse that I was cold

1439
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,024
to cuddle with Ibrehem

1440
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,609
'cause he sure is a cutie.
