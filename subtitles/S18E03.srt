Who will be voted out tonight?

>> The last thing in the world

53
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,342
I wanted to do was give Candace

54
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,677
any idea that I was voting for

55
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,386
her.

56
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,056
And, like, not knowing what

57
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,432
everybody else was doing, I was

58
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:39,849
like, oh, my God.

59
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,684
This could be the very last

60
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,062
nail in my own coffin.

61
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,231

62
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,775
it coming for us voting Candace.

63
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,360
And then when she did, she's

64
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,778
trying to, she's trying to back

65
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:52,904
out really fast.

66
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,697
She's-she's kind of panicking.

67
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,573
>> You guys were pretty

68
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,658
attached at the hips the

69
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,117
last two days.

70
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,202
>> 'Cause I wasn't sure about

71
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,036
her.

72
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:00,662
>> But she was turning on the

73
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,871
rest of us.

74
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,039
>> Yeah.

75
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:03,456
>> And you...

76
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,375
>> But I did know though...

77
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:05,750
>> You knew that.

78
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,252
>> You knew she was turning on

79
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,545
the rest of us, right?

80
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,046
>> But, like, it just really

81
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,381
wasn't a decision that I wanted

82
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,841
to make lightly until I felt

83
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,133
like, felt like I knew her

84
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:14,425
pretty well.

85
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,719
And once I did, I just felt

86
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,471
like I could not trust her for

87
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,473
a second.

88
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,141
>> Not only did she align

89
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:22,767
herself with the wrong person--

90
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,311
Candace-- she's has completely

91
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,021
insulted all of our

92
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,731
intelligences when we came back

93
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,775
tonight and she said, "You

94
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,526
know, I've just been hanging

95
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,360
around with Candace the last

96
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,988
couple of days because I just

97
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:35,572
wanted to see what she was up

98
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,740
to because I didn't trust her."

99
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,366
>> We weren't not getting along.

100
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,452
I was very cautious with her.

101
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,996
But I wasn't like, "Okay, we're

102
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,038
best friends."

103
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,331
Well, it's all over with, so

104
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,667
that's good.

105
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,670
>> For her to say that to us is

106
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,213
insulting, which is why she

107
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:52,755
never would have been in my

108
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,381
alliance from the very

109
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,966
beginning.

110
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:55,884
And she's made her bed, and

111
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,010
she's going to have to lie in

112
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:57,886
it.

really, really suck it up and do

152
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,691
it because now I feel like I'm

153

beans or something I've been

170
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,813
eating or something that's been

171
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,731
causing my stomach to hurt real

172
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,982
bad.

173
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,275

174
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,818

179
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:05,615
I'm used to some type of

180
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,617
situations like this when I was

181
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,410
in, uh, Afghanistan or

182
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,995
different-- other military

183
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,788
spots, so--

184
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,164
I never like to show weakness

185
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,831
anywhere I go.

186
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,041
I always want to be looked upon

187
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,877
as one of the stronger ones.

188
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,087
While everybody is doing their

189
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,629
normal activities, I got to

190
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,507
pretend that I'm happy, but

191
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,591
really inside, it's miserable.

192
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,425
(chuckles)

193
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,551
I'm-I'm trying to fight through

194
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,761
this.

195
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,887
I figure another day or so, I

196
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,471
should be good.

197
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,931
(groans)

198
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,017
>> How you feeling, Jerry?

199
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,185
>> Mother said there'd be days

200
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:34,852
like this.

201
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,394
>> Yeah.

202
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,438
(Jerry chuckles)

203
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,319
>> There are a bunch over here.

204
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,403
You want to move on this side?

205
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,696
>> Yeah, sure.

206
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,906
I see some over here.

207
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,116
>> There's a couple in there,

208
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,075
small ones.

209
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,076
>> There are a bunch of small

210
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,660
ones over here.

211
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,202
>> There's some right-right

212
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,370
under me.

213
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,497
>> Drop it.

214
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,331
He was right here.

215
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,541
Let's make sure.

216
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,542
>> We got fishing gear in the

217
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,044
challenge yesterday, and we were

218
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:00,795
all so psyched.

219
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,921
We assume... I think we all

220
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,463
imagined that we would be

221
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,800
feasting on plates of fish.

222
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,176
>> I see some over here.

223
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,094
>> There's a couple in there,

224
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:08,761
small ones.

225
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,929
>> There's a big one right here.

226
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,472
If we can get it over enough, we

227
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,265
can catch him.

228
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,141
>> Toss it far.

229
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,518
>> One, two, three.

230
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,602
You threw it on my head.

231
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,187
>> I'm sorry.

232
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,188
>> That might, it might be all

233
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,064
right.

234
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,983
>> No, he got out.

235
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:22,900
>> We're having a lot of

236
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,527
problems catching minnows.

237
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,071
We're not entirely sure how to

238
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:27,363
use the net.

239
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,407
J.T. thinks it's a throw net,

240
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,658
but it seems way too big for one

241
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,784
person to throw.

242
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,369
So we... I think we need to

243
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,288
figure out a good system.

244
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,125
>> One, two, three.

245
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,506
It's still not easy, but, you

246
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,883
know, we figured out, you know,

247
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,050
live bait with the minnows is

248
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,177
definitely the way to go.

249
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,386
This water is just a little

250
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,345
different from where I came

251
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,430
from, but we'll get it under

252
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,391
control.

253
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,351
>> Oh, baby, come on in.

254
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:57,727
>> You see him?

255
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,313
>> Got him.

256
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:00,771
>> Woo-hoo!

257
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,192
>> Attaboy.

258
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,193
>> All right.

259
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,486
Attaboy, J.

260
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,696
>> Think this may be first fish

261
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,906
I've ever caught.

262
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,865
>> Oh, it is.

263
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:11,866
Good.

264
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,909
>> Oh, oh!

265
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,327
I got one, buddy!

266
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,369
>> Oh, my God!

267
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,621
>> Oh, my God!

268
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,747
Whoa!

269
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,665
That is a fish.

270
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,833
Hello, dinner.

271
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,709
>> That's right.

272
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,961
>> My biggest fish yet.

273
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,884
>> I could eat.

274
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,052
>> Today is the first day I feel

275
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,220
really hungry.

276
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,095
>> Look at that.

277
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,721
>> That one looks delish.

278
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,514
>> Oh, my God.

279
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,974
It's like a feast.

280
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:37,767
Mmm.

281
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,602
>> It's amazing how it doesn't

282
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,353
need seasoning.

283
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,229
It just tastes well seasoned,

284
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:41,604
doesn't it?

285
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,855
>> Yeah.

286
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,899
>> Thank you, guys.

287
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,900
>> Thank you, guys.

288
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:46,943
>> Did you eat that skin?

289
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,611
>> That fish tasted just like

290
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:48,819
victory.

291
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,654
Just knowing that we got a

292
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,656
little food, finally using the

293
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,657
fishing gear the way it should

294
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,201
be used, I think it means that

295
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,327
we're just a force to be

296
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,329
reckoned with right now.

297
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:11,926
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

298
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,469
Jalapao getting your first look

299
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,012
at the new Timbira.

300
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:15,638
Candace voted out at the last

301
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,600
Tribal Council.

302
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,601
For today's challenge, six

303
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,853
members of each tribe will be

304
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,897
blindfolded and tied together

305
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,982
in pairs.

306
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,233
The remaining tribe member will

307
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:27,817
guide you through a maze.

308
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,403
You'll locate your bucket, then

309
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,154
make your way to a water tower,

310
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:32,780
where you must fill your bucket,

311
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,782
then race back to the start and

312
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,784
empty the water into a

313
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,827
container, raising a flag.

314
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,204
You'll then repeat the process,

315
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,164
this time collecting corn from

316
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,207
another tower.

317
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:43,749
First tribe to fill both

318
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,252
containers, raising both flags,

319
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:46,919
wins reward.

320
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,628
Want to know what you're

321
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,296
playing for?

322
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,380
>> Yes, please!

323
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,006
>> PROBST: It starts with this

324
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,174
tarp.

325
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:52,675
>> Oh!

326
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,467
(shrieking)

327
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,135
>> PROBST: It includes an

328
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:54,677
umbrella, chairs, pillows,

329
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,679
blankets, and a hammock.

330
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,847
In addition, the winning tribe

331
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,433
will choose one member of the

332
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,934
losing tribe to go to Exile

333
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:02,685
Island, and that person will

334
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,645
select somebody from the winning

335
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,647
tribe to join them.

336
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,023
Worth playing for?

337
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,566
>> Yes.

338
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,525
>> PROBST: Give you a minute to

339
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:10,484
figure out who's gonna be

340
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,569
blindfolded, who's gonna be the

341
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:11,944
guide.

342
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,281
We'll get started.

343
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,159
The caller for Jalapao: Joe.

344
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,202
For Timbira: Debra.

345
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:20,786
Here we go, for reward.

346
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,122
Survivors ready?

347
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:23,873
Go!

348
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,665
>> J.T., Sydney, go left.

349
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,084
Y'all start moving, Spencer.

350
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:27,918
>> Straight!

351
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:28,627
Straight!

352
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,462
>> PROBST: Take a lot of

353
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,963
teamwork to figure this out.

354
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,048
>> Straight, straight, straight!

355
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,050
>> J.T., start inching left.

356
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:34,925
>> PROBST: First thing you have

357
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,802
to do is find your buckets.

358
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,846
Each pair will have a bucket.

359
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,930
>> I got a bucket.

360
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,515
>> PROBST: J.T.'s got a bucket.

361
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,433
>> Right, right, right!

362
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:42,892
Faster!

363
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,100
Forward!

364
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,769
Forward, forward, forward!

365
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,062
>> PROBST: Sierra's got a

366
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:46,645
bucket.

367
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,229
>> Get on that rail!

368
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,272
Go right! Go right!

369
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:48,898
>> PROBST: Taj has got a bucket.

370
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,442
Spencer's got a bucket.

371
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,194
Jalapao has their buckets.

372
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:53,819
Now you got to start collecting

373
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,404
water.

374
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,947
>> Spencer, water's to your

375
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,156
right!

376
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,991
>> Water's on your right, right!

377
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,159
>> Step straight!

378
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,535
It is on your right!

379
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,120
>> PROBST: Tyson has his bucket.

380
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,038
>> Keep going! Keep going!

381
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:04,455
>> Here, here, here.

382
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:04,997
Put the bucket right here.

383
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,249

are you going to send to Exile

556
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,594

are going back yet again, have

569
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,572

>> PROBST: Brendan, your map,

574
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,704
not that you need it.

575
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,205
Head down to the beach.

576
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,498
>> Bye, baby.

577
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,249
>> PROBST: You'll both be back

578
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:17,958
in time for the next immunity

579
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,960
challenge.

580
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,795
Jalapao, grab your stuff.

581
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,463
Head out.

582
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,131
You've got a lot it carry.

583
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,216
>> Oh, my gosh.

584
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,926
>> PROBST: Camp life at Jalapao

585
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,011
just got a whole lot better.

586
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,514
Sadly, Timbira, I got nothing

587
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,098
for you.

588
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:33,849
Grab your stuff.

589
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,225
Head back to camp.

590
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,310
>> We've got to turn it around,

591
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,061
just for every reason

592
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,022
imaginable: pride, the rewards,

593
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,192
the anger that I'm feeling.

594
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,943
Winners find a way to win.

595
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,779
Losers find a way to lose.

596
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:52,409
We've got it get it together.

597
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,495
(thunder rumbles)

598
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,337
>> Yes.

599
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,380
>> Yeah, I know it.

600
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,172
>> I think we need to have a

601
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,590
little talk later.

602
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,676
>> What happened?

603
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:10,511
>> No, it wasn't.

604
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,095
>> I let out a scream at the

605
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,639
end of the challenge, a primal

606
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,684
yell that was about a quarter

607
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,143
of what I felt inside because I

608
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:18,477
was just so...

609
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,104
I was so pissed off.

610
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,939
>> If we give in right now to

611
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,439
it, it's...

612
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,524
>> Give in?

613
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,983
We're not giving in.

614
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:25,609
>> I mean, just like, give in to

615
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,695
the anger or the upsetness.

616
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,278
>> I was totally embarrassed.

617
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,615
I mean, there's no other word

618
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:31,865
for it.

619
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,282
We were humiliated.

620
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,576
>> Now, my biggest thing is I

621
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,536
just feel like I've let

622
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,245
everybody down.

623
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,538
>> I mean...

624
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,664
>> Sierra said you guys couldn't

625
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,206
hear me.

626
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,916
And I was screaming at the top

627
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:41,208
of my lungs.

628
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,084
Maybe that was the problem.

629
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,502
I was screaming instead of...

630
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,837
>> It's not like we're not all

631
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,504
trying.

632
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,380
>> No, not at all.

633
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,923
>> There's nothing about trying.

634
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:48,507
I mean, the last that thing we

635
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,508
should do...

636
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,719
And I beg all of you to not go

637
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,345
off in groups and say, "Man,

638
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,972
you know, Erinn really screwed

639
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:55,514
up today or Debbie really

640
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,265
screwed up today," because that

641
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,851
would be the worst thing we

642
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,936
could do.

643
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,152
>> So, what are you thinking?

644
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,737
>> People are just panicked in

645
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,320
the challenges.

646
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:10,654
Did you see...

647
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,155
Have you seen Sierra?

648
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,489
>> Yeah.

649
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,490
>> She screams.

650
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,909
She's like, "Aah! I can't hear!

651
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,118
Aah!"

652
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,120
Every time.

653
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,121
I'm just like, "Oh, my goodness.

654
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,039
I mean, who's worse?

655
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,540
Is it Erinn?

656
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,792
Is it, you know, Sierra?

657
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,418
I mean, obviously, I want to get

658
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,128
Erinn out immediately.

659
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,338
>> One word to describe Coach?

660
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,548
I think that's it.

661
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,132
"Coach."

662
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,508
You know?

663
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,093
He's not always the best at what

664
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,680
he's coaching, but he thinks he

665
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,890
knows the most.

666
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,808
>> I mean you, me, Sierra, and

667
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,434
Debbie are going to vote Erinn

668
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,435
off next.

669
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,394
It doesn't matter what Brendan

670
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:42,895
thinks.

671
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:43,604
I'm sure he'll be with us

672
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,522
because that's four to three.

673
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,648
>> He likes his voice to be

674
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,233
heard, which is what we all want

675
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,696
and all need.

676
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,363
>> And we only just see things.

677
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:53,947
We don't even have to talk.

678
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,948
And I think that's going to

679
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:55,324
be...

680
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:55,866
But as we're getting to know

681
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,950
each other, you know...

682
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,659
>> Yeah.

683
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,202
>> The first seven days, I

684
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:58,827
wanted to make sure you saw it

685
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,412
the exact same way as I did.

686
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,915
(laughing)

687
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,332
>> You know what?

688
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,542
When he told me I was like his

689
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,335
assistant coach, more power to

690
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,294
me, you know?

691
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,087
>> Cool.

692
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:09,463
>> Thank you.

693
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,422
>> Yup, sweet.

694
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,965
I'm glad we're seeing it exactly

695
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,591
the same.

696
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,217
I love it.

697
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,176
>> But he has a little

698
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,135
schoolboy crush on me.

699
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,638
People see that.

700
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,305
He loves me, you know.

701
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,182
So, if I just keep plugging

702
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,141
away, I'll eventually make

703
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:21,350
coach.

704
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,018
He may promote me.

705
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:23,769
I don't know if I'll have my

706
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,395
own team or will be co-coach,

707
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,230
or whatever.

708
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,314
But people are going to start

709
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,315
calling me that.

710
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,317
I'm actually going to demand it.

711
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,735
If we ever get put on separate

712
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,612
tribes in this game, I will

713
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,238
demand that the other tribe

714
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,323
calls me "Coach," too.

715
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,705
>> On three.

716
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,748
One, two, three!

717
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,791
>> Pao!

718
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:46,667
>> All right.

719
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,543
>> Pao!

720
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,710
>> Oh, my God.

721
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,711
>> We did great.

722
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,337
I mean, we did.

723
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,922
>> That was awesome.

724
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,298
>> It was like organized chaos.

725
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,092
>> You did phenomenal.

726
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,928
Slow and methodical.

727
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,137
>> We won.

728
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,347
We won the reward challenge

729
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,557
today.

730
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,182
It was awesome.

731
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,600
We work very, very well

732
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:03,892
together.

733
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,186
>> Coach was pissed.

734
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,689
"I'm pissed!"

735
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,398
>> Hey, if we get this next

736
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,233
immunity challenge today,

737
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,150
we're sweeping.

738
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:12,734
Timbira's got to be struggling

739
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,194
right now with morale.

740
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,863
I mean, I think we put it to

741
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,363
them pretty good today.

742
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,532
I mean, we could really do some

743
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,616
damage if we won the next

744
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,036
challenge.

745
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,912
>> Hey, can we get somebody

746
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,496
else back here to help lift

747
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,624
this up?

748
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,250
>> We got to run it back here,

749
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,252
too.

750
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,796
>> It's got to come back my way.

751
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,214
>> Back this way.

752
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,883
>> It makes a huge difference

753
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,925
to have a tarp because we know

754
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,261
it's hard to make a roof rain

755
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,888
proof at this point, and I know

756
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,430
they're getting soaked and

757
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,222
we're staying dry and that's

758
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,974
going to make a big difference

759
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,059
on the next challenge.

760
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,900
>> To say...

761
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,234
To say something about the fact

762
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,819
that not only are they taking

763
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,445
those pillows and blankets, they

764
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,362
took my other blanket and

765
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,740
brought it to Exile.

766
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,325
(thunder rumbles)

767
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,327
>> Judging on the fact that

768
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,286
Jalapao seems to be a hell of a

769
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,580
lot dirtier than us, they

770
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,915
probably need that stuff more

771
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,749
than we do.

772
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,374
I don't care about comfort.

773
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,459
No shelter.

774
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,920
Let me bury myself in the sand,

775
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,504
get eaten by tarantulas and

776
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:14,922
bitten by snakes.

777
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,048
I don't care about comfort

778
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:16,548
anymore.

779
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,049
I don't want care about

780
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,342
anything else except for winning

781
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,427
this game.

782
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,351
>> You must choose...

783
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,480
Each choose an urn.

784
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,898
Oh, damn.

785
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:33,732

786
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,359
I keep doing the same thing.

787
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,276
Oh, no.

788
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,487
I got it this time.

789
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,906
Open in private.

790
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:41,531
All right.

791
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,741
I'll be back in two seconds.

792
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,367
>> Okay.

793
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,827
>> Clue Two.

794
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,162
"You must search around.

795
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,164
You can and you should.

796
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,457
The item desired is surround by

797
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,251
wood."

798
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,211
>> Uh-oh.

799
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:54,962
(Taj laughs)

800
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:55,379
>> What do we got?

801
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,505
>> It's back home.

802
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,422
It's surrounded by wood.

803
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,216
>> We got another clue.

804
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,008
>> We got another clue.

805
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,093
We got another clue.

806
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:01,969
>> Oh, perfect.

807
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,719
Perfect!

808
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,512
>> Oh, good.

809
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,597
Brendan and I back in Exile

810
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,306
Island.

811
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,808
He's kind of working right

812
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,517
along with me.

813
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,643
We both have the same goals in

814
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,144
mind in that we're trying to

815
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,021
find the idol so we can both be

816
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,106
safe in the long run.

817
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,315
So, then, we have at least three

818
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:15,524
days...

819
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,943
Or two days after we get back

820
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:18,527
from Exile to find it on our

821
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,028
own.

822
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:20,779
>> When I get back to camp, I'm

823
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:21,571
going to look for the idol

824
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,823
immediately and the first place

825
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,865
I'm going to look is something

826
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,908
that's surrounded by wood.

827
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,118
When I hear, "surrounded by

828
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,536
wood," I think of my shelter.

829
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,247
I think of the tree mail area.

830
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,039
So that's probably where I'll

831
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,125
take a peek.

832
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,586
The key is getting the immunity

833
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:36,795
idol.

834
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,879
>> I know.

835
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,506
If we don't find it by the time

836
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,632
somebody else gets here and gets

837
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,633
a clue, then we're outed.

838
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,635
Unless we can convince them to

839
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:43,969
send us again.

840
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,804
>> God...

841
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,805
Hopefully, we can and we'll

842
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,389
work on that.

843
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,015
>> Right.

844
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,516
>> But if we can't, who else do

845
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:49,725
we send?

846
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,476
>> Steve.

847
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,019
Do Steve and I'll prep him

848
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,688
before the next challenge, so

849
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,023
he'll know.

850
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,357
>> Okay.

851
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,943
So then, like, I'll go to

852
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,527
Sierra.

853
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,737

854
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:01,945
Sierra?

855
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,031
>> Yeah, I think I can.

856
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,906
>> Okay.

857
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,532

858

859
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,410
I'll work Steve.

862

00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,183
I will see you at Tribal

1140
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,017
tonight.

1141
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,143
>> I feel a great deal of

1142
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:30,935
responsibility for the loss

1143
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,103
today because I couldn't give it

1144
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,146
my all.

1145
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,814
I'm weak. I'm-I'm real weak.

1146
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,483
My stomach just feels so bad.

1147
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,025
It's like, uh, somebody's in

1148
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,277
there with... two boxers in

1149
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,403
there boxing around.

1150
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,029
But, uh, I'm pretty sure that

1151
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,989
everybody started looking at me

1152
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:43,823
like, uh, "Jerry's not getting

1153
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,325
any better.

1154
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,451
He's probably the weakest link

1155
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,994
on the tribe, so maybe get rid

1156
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:57,921
of him."

1157
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:01,007
(bird squawks)

1158
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,050
>> How you feeling, Jerry?

1159
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,970
Better?

1160
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,097
>> I'm gonna go take a dip.

1161
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,225
>> Okay.

1162
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,351
>> Jerry, there's some extra

1163
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:11,976
water over here.

1164
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,353
Do you want me to fill your

1165
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,438
canteen?

1166
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,150
You sure?

1167
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:24,072
>> Yeah, I got plenty here.

1168
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,616
But I felt pretty good when we

1169
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,200
went down and got that first

1170
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,910
block, but after that all my

1171
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,621
energy was zapped.

1172
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,039
But I'm trying to... trying

1173
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:37,418
to... endure.

1174
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,836
Trying to tough it out best I

1175
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,380
can.

1176
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,005
I'm not gonna quit, though.

1177
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,048
That's for sure.

1178
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,217
I'm not a quitter.

1179
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,594
(chuckles)

1180
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,595
They got to vote me out.

1181
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,682
I'm not giving up.

1182
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,143
>> I think we had a

1183
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,728
communication breakdown at some

1184
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,189
point today, and I can't quite

1185
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,190
figure out what it was.

1186
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,358
>> We got this, we're just...

1187
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,484
it's just the beginning of the

1188
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,068
game.

1189
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,236
>> We're just one behind.

1190
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,320
We're one person behind now.

1191
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,655
>> Yeah, it's, like, no big

1192
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,197
deal; we'll figure it out.

1193
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,907
Is Jerry okay?

1194
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,950
>> The beans are making him

1195
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,326
sick, and that's all we... you

1196
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,036
know, we can't eat all the rice.

1197
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,912
>> Shut up.

1198
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,955
>> 'Cause he won't eat the

1199
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:14,789
beans.

1200
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:15,665
>> He can't... he hasn't eaten,

1201
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,792
really, in... since you've left.

1202
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,170
>> The most unfortunate thing

1203
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:21,963
about this whole situation is

1204
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,965
that as soon as Erinn realized

1205
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,884
that Jerry was not sick, she

1206
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,136
turned around and looked at the

1207
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,222
tribe with the evil sneer, kind

1208
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,642
of like...

1209
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,186
"I'm staying."

1210
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,652
>> What?

1211
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,446
>> I'm so pissed off, man.

1212
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,072
When she saw Jerry, it

1213
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,033
registered that she was still

1214
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:50,283
staying.

1215
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,034
She went... I'm not kidding

1216
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,411
you; I practiced her look.

1217
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,496
She went like this.

1218
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,502
It was the evilest look.

1219
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,421
I can't stand it, man.

1220
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,631
>> That's why I'm talking to

1221
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,214
Jerry and telling him to stay

1222
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,468
strong so we can get rid of her.

1223
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,093
>> I think my relationship with

1224
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,220
Tyson started out like head

1225
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,221
coach/assistant coach.

1226
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,598
But I go to him first because

1227
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,849
if he's my right-hand man, if

1228
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,893
he's my general, then I want to

1229
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,935
make sure that we're clear with

1230
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:18,394
our orders.

1231
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,103
>> Let's still go with Erinn.

1232
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,064
But Debbie and Sierra, those are

1233
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,107
the two I'm gonna have to talk

1234
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,317
to.

1235
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,818
>> I mean, we're only as strong

1236
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,694
as our weakest link.

1237
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,237
>> Well, yeah, she did know she

1238
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,280
was going home if Jerry wasn't

1239
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:29,489
sick.

1240
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,198
>> Yeah, and it just makes me

1241
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,618
sick because I-I exist... to

1242
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,953
surround myself with people that

1243
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,288
have integrity, and I cannot

1244
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,831
exist around people like that.

1245
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,374
You guys can because you can

1246
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,792
socialize with them.

1247
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,212
I am so true... that existing

1248
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,965
around people that smile evilly

1249
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,092
when somebody else is on their

1250
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:49,467
knees kills me.

1251
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,010
I can't exist around... I can't

1252
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,345
look at her in camp, I can't

1253
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,347
walk by her now.

1254
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,723
>> Coach is definitely pissed

1255
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,475
about voting out Jerry, but I am

1256
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,394
honestly not going to sever off

1257
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,145
another limb so that we can get

1258
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,231
our vendettas against Erinn.

1259
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,774
>> She's still an asset to a

1260
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,441
certain extent.

1261
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,734
In the beginning when they saw

1262
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,236
<i>me</i> sick and they saw<i> me</i> weak,

1263
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,737
they were gonna vote me out.

1264
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,698
So, as much as I have grown to

1265
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,366
actually like and be fond of

1266
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,244
Jerry, I'm not gonna be stupid.

1267
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,207
>> You gotta stay strong, man.

1268
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,126
You gotta...

1269
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,669
stick it in there if you can,

1270
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:25,837
you know.

1271
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,965
Don't... yeah, don't give up.

1272
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,050
>> Yeah.

1273
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,678
What do you have in mind?

1274
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,387
>> Erinn.

1275
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,221
>> Erinn?

1276
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,097
>> She was right on board with

1277
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,305
Candace.

1278
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,516
To me, it looks like she's just

1279
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,978
here to lie and deceive and...

1280
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,021
you know, get ahead any way

1281
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,189
she can.

1282
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,607
>> Has anybody been talking

1283
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,900
about voting me out?

1284
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,485
>> No, nobody has.

1285
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,570
You try and look as strong as

1286
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,904
you can.

1287
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,240
Don't say anything to anybody.

1288
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,786
>> Yeah.

1289
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,249
(thunder rumbling)

1290
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,877
>> With Tribal Council coming, I

1291
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,211
I knew I only had a couple of

1292
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,671
hours to get my act together

1293
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,297
and go look for the idol, and so

1294
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,173
I immediately kind of went to

1295
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,216
the one place that made the

1296
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,342
most sense to me, and that was

1297
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,178
kind of the statue next to tree

1298
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,180
mail.

1299
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,932
And I got up to it, and, like,

1300
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,225
started shaking the thing, and

1301
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,268
nothing happened.

1302
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,227
And I finally just, like, pushed

1303
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,437
it out and, like, tried to look

1304
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,480
underneath it because I thought

1305
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,856
it might be there.

1306
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,774
It wasn't there.

1307
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:28,816
And then just started kind of

1308
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,984
feeling around and looking at

1309
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:30,526
the skirt, and then kind of

1310
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,235
lifted up the skirt on the

1311
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,321
backside of it and saw a little

1312
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,074
hole and there was the idol.

1313
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,828
Yes!

1314
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,080
That makes not eating for a

1315
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,166
couple of days worth it.

1316
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,337
Good, good, good news.

1317
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,214
It all worked out.

1318
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,256
You know, the plan worked,

1319
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,508
which was perfect.

1320
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,967
As an entrepreneur, when I

1321
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:55,551
think about business, like, to

1322
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,260
me it was never about making

1323
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,596
money, and even with<i> Survivor</i>

1324
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,680
it's not about making money.

1325
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,723
I love winning games, I love

1326
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,725
playing games, competing and

1327
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,477
winning them.

1328
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,103
So as long as you're focused on

1329
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,146
doing something that you love

1330
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,397
and you're playing the game the

1331
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,900
right way, good stuff happens.

1332
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,985
Keep my fingers crossed.

1333
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,327
>> Jerry, you want some beans?

1334
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,667
>> Like you don't want to be

1335
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,126
like, hey, everybody, Jerry's

1336
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,254
sick, but you kind of want to be

1337
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,171
like, hey, everybody, Jerry's

1338
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,173
sick.

1339
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,675
And trying to, like, wrestle

1340
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,968
with all these options of,

1341
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:37,552
like, how do you bring it up

1342
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,345
delicately, how do you make it

1343
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,555
look like you're not trying to

1344
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,889
throw someone under the bus or

1345
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,182
save your own ass because every

1346
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,725
time we send someone home who

1347
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,226
doesn't want to be here it

1348
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,228
leaves a space for someone who

1349
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,897
does and I want to be here so

1350
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,191
see you, Jerry.

1351
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,361
>> Where's the thumb meter?

1352
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,239
Sideways?

1353
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,198
>> I'm doing better.

1354
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,200
Thumb is sideways right now.

1355
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,953
It was down; now it's sideways.

1356
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,454
>> It's moving up.

1357
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,290
>> Yeah, it's moving up.

1358
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,541
Taste of a good cheeseburger,

1359
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,208
I'd be back on top.

1360
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,294
(laughing)

1361
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,425
>> Yeah, I think Jerry's

1362
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,384
illness has put a couple of

1363
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,177
eyeballs on him.

1364
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,262
I mean, if he's in pain and

1365
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,263
can't compete in the

1366
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,306
challenges, if he's the weak

1367
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,724
link and it comes to Tribal

1368
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,975
Council, he could be the next

1369
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,977
one to go.

1370
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,145
But anytime there's a

1371
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,187
blindside, it's pretty awesome,

1372
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:30,771
just the look on somebody's

1373
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,356
face.

1374
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,442
I think Erinn wants to be here

1375
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,777
so, so bad, that her getting

1376
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,779
blindsided would look really

1377
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,323
cool.

1378
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,909
I love seeing people cry when

1379
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,036
you crush their dreams.

1380
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,968
>> PROBST: Tyson, let's

1381
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:01,469
talk about momentum.

1382
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,221
Jalapao clearly has it.

1383
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,723
How important is it in a game

1384
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,849
like this?

1385
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,767
>> Momentum's extremely

1386
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,517
important.

1387
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,352
I think we got a little bit

1388
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,604
arrogant, and they're on a high

1389
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,731
right now, and we're on a low.

1390
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,357
I mean, it doesn't take much to

1391
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,777
regain momentum, just a win.

1392
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,070
If we can all focus and get

1393
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,155
together then it can flip-flop

1394
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,573
pretty fast.

1395
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,950
>> PROBST: Well, what I noticed

1396
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,409
today in the challenge was Erinn

1397
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,661
right off the bat said, "I have

1398
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,038
a plan, let's follow it," and it

1399
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,081
was over.

1400
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:30,873
>> That's exactly what

1401
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,666
happened.

1402
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,792
I said, "This piece goes here."

1403
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,001
Everybody said, "No, no, no,

1404
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,044
that's not right."

1405
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:35,670
People panicked and we all did

1406
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,755
nothing and then went, "Oh,

1407
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,215
yeah, okay, that is right."

1408
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,633
And it was too late by then.

1409
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,884
>> PROBST: How frustrating is

1410
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,010
that for you when you felt like

1411
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,511
you knew it all along?

1412
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,972
>> I...

1413
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,391
it was just frustrating.

1414
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,892
>> PROBST: Brendan, do you think

1415
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,394
this group communicates as well

1416
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,020
as it needs to?

1417
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,146
>> I think we communicate very

1418
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,649
well.

1419
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,441
>> PROBST: Jerry, you were

1420
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:57,984
shaking your head back and

1421
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,443
forth as fast as you could.

1422
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,319
>> Well, for instance, in

1423
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,570
today's challenge, if we'd of

1424
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,572
had a controlling person to say,

1425
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,533
"Okay, you got it; we're all

1426
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,201
going to listen to you, bam."

1427
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,452
But that didn't happen.

1428
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,537
We just need to establish a

1429
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,329
leader.

1430
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:10,871
>> PROBST: Who should it be,

1431
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,206
Jerry?

1432
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,874
>> I think it should be...

1433
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,127
Brendan.

1434
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,044
>> PROBST: Coach, you agree with

1435
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,004
that; Brendan's the guy that

1436
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:18,587
should be leading this tribe?

1437
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,506
>> Being the devil's advocate,

1438
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,424
let's say Brendan is the

1439
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,717
leader; he has to take the

1440
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,260
reins.

1441
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,261
I'm not suggesting that I'm the

1442
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,887
leader, but on the truck I was

1443
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,180
making eye contact with

1444
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,640
everybody and the reason why it

1445
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,017
worked so smoothly is because I

1446
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,351
basically told everybody with

1447
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,687
my eyes to get what they needed

1448
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,771
to get.

1449
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:36,605
>> PROBST: So it sounds like you

1450
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,481
should be leading.

1451
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,315
>> Well, absolutely, I would

1452
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:38,983
love to be leader.

1453
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:39,567
That's what I'm used to doing.

1454
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,484
>> PROBST: Erinn you had about

1455
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,403
five different reactions.

1456
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,738
Just share one with me.

1457
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,864
>> I think it's a role that

1458
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,198
Coach is used to.

1459
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,408
It's a role that he would love

1460
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,534
to be in, but it's something

1461
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,495
that Brendan does better.

1462
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,455
>> PROBST: Coach?

1463
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,581
>> Again, I'm not criticizing

1464
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,124
Brendan, but we've lost three

1465
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:55,750
challenges in a row and for her

1466
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,752
to be so quick to say that, I

1467
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,086
think comes more to a

1468
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,421
personality clash between us

1469
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:00,588
two.

1470
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,505
>> I didn't know we had a

1471
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,424
personality clash.

1472
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,760
You have these great ideas, but

1473
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,762
I don't ever see you saying

1474
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,804
more than, "Well, I have this

1475
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,430
idea, but you guys do whatever

1476
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,349
you're going to do."

1477
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,184
>> PROBST: So you're saying

1478
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:13,934
he's a little

1479
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:14,852
passive-aggressive, throwing

1480
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:15,811
throwing out an idea, but not

1481
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,562
owning it?

1482
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,521
>> Uh-huh.

1483
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,814
>> PROBST: Coach, is that hard

1484
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:19,732
to hear?

1485
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,816
'Cause it sounds like what

1486
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,984
you're struggling with a little

1487
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:22,485
bit is ego.

1488
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,237
>> It's not about ego because

1489
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,781
I would rather toe the line and

1490
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,365
be a good assistant coach than

1491
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:28,908
try to be a head coach and

1492
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,533
stroke my ego.

1493
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,576
What I was doing was I

1494
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,411
was justifying why I should be

1495
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,373
the leader, and why I registered

1496
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,457
surprise when Erinn said it's

1497
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,001
Brendan.

1498
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,002
>> PROBST: Jerry, how is

1499
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:40,920
tonight's vote going to make

1500
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:41,587
this tribe better?

1501
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,548
>> I think tonight's vote will

1502
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,175
make this tribe better because

1503
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:46,801
it will get rid of the weakest

1504
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,719
person.

1505
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,931

1507
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,226
Coach, you're up.

1508
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,569
>> I hope you feel better.

1509
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,331
>> Love you, sweetheart, but we

1510
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:20,000

votes.

1513
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,481
If anybody has the hidden

1514
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,774
immunity idol and you want to

1515
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,567
play it, now would be the time

1516
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,570
to do so.

1517
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,572
Okay, once the votes are read,

1518
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,573
the decision is final.

1519
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,657
The person voted out will be

1520
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,575
asked to leave the Tribal

1521
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,909
Council area immediately.

1522
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,995
I'll read the votes.

1523

First vote: Jerry.

1524
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:03,711
Jerry.

1525
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,796

00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,467

Jerry.

1529
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,725
That's three votes Jerry;

1530
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,810

That's four; that's enough.

1534
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,779
You need to bring me your torch.

1535
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,206
Jerry, the tribe has spoken.

1536
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,666
Time for you to go.

1537
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:53,719
Well, according to you guys,

1538
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,554
tonight's vote was all about

1539
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,264
making this tribe stronger.

1540
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,557
Time will tell if you made the

1541
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,016
right decision or not.

1542
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,226
Grab your torches.

1543
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,018
Head back to camp.

1544
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,228

Sydney turns on the charm.

1556
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,751
>> I definitely try to flirt

1557
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,586
when it comes to this game.

game.

1562
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,688
>> As far as my experiences in

1563
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,772
Afghanistan and the military

1564
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,942
career, this by far was the

1565
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,569
toughest thing I have endured

1566
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,696
in my life.

1567
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,321
I don't know what happened to

1568
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,115
my stomach, but in 130-degree

1569
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,449
heat and me not being able to

1570
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,285
eat anything took a toll on my

1571
00:42:59,368 --> 00:42:59,618
body.

1572
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,704
I'm hoping and praying that one

1573
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:02,288
of my tribe members will win

1574
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,040
that million dollars.
