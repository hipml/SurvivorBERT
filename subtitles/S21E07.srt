1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,462
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY
ON<i> SURVIVOR.</i>

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,548
DROP YOUR BUFFS.

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,674
WE ARE SWITCHING TRIBES.

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:11,261
AFTER A SURPRISE SWITCH,
THE YOUNG AND OLD WERE COMBINED,

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,179
BUT ON EACH TRIBE,
THE YOUNG ADOPTED

6
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,974
A FEISTY OLDER MOM
TO GET THE UPPER HAND.

7
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,308
>> I LOVE YOUR ENERGY.

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,310
>> Jeff: THE ESPADA YOUTH
PICKED UP HOLLY.

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,479
>> 100% I'M ON BOARD.

10
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,773
>> Jeff: AND THE LA FLOR KIDS
PICKED UP JANE.

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,067
>> I'M AS THICK
AS PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY

12
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,277
WITH THE YOUNGER LA FLOR TRIBE.

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,114
>> Jeff: THAT LEFT EVERYONE ELSE
NORTH OF 40 OUT IN THE COLD.

14
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,115
>> WE'VE BEEN DEALT
A VERY BAD HAND.

15
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,993
>> Jeff:
THEN AN EVEN BIGGER SURPRISE

16
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,453
SENT BOTH TRIBES REELING.

17
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,246
BOTH TRIBES ARE GOING
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

18
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:44,002
BOTH TRIBES WILL VOTE SOMEBODY
OUT OF THIS GAME.

19
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,338
AT LA FLOR, BRENDA AND SASH
WERE IN COMPLETE CONTROL.

20
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,299
THEY WANTED TO FLUSH OUT
MARTY'S HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

21
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,968
AND BLIND-SIDE KELLY B.

22
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,636
>> IF EVERYTHING GOES
ACCORDING TO PLAN,

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,265
WE'LL BE ABLE TO KILL
A COUPLE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.

24
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,851
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
SASH AND BRENDA WERE SURE

25
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,478
THAT MARTY WOULD PLAY HIS IDOL.

26
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,604
IF ANYBODY HAS
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

27
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:08,485
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

28
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,153
BUT HE SHOCKED THEM
BY HOLDING ON TO IT.

29
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,782
MARTY'S GAMBLE PAID OFF,
BECAUSE HE KEPT HIS IDOL

30
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,700
AND KELLY B. WENT HOME.

31
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,536
KELLY B., THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

32
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,500
NOW MARTY AND HIS ALLY JILL
ARE TWO AGAINST FIVE.

33
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,336
AT THE ESPADA TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THE YOUTH HAD TO DECIDE

34
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,464
BETWEEN YVE, WHOSE STRENGTH
COULD HELP THEM IN CHALLENGES,

35
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,176
OR DAN, WHO, BECAUSE OF HIS BAD
KNEE, WOULD NEVER BE A THREAT.

36
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,137
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

37
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,056
THE PERSON VOTED OUT
WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE

38
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,307
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

39
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,517
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,019
IN THE END,
YVE'S STRENGTH WAS HER UNDOING.

41
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:47,023
YVE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

42
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:50,527
13 ARE LEFT--
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

43
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,704
(\CROWING\)

44
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,376
>> OH...! WHAT A DAY.

45
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,044
>> 13 LEFT.

46
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,212
>> THANK YOU, HONEY.
THANK YOU.

47
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,840
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

48
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,383
>> ALL RIGHT, I NEED A...

49
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,676
>> WE LOVE YOU, DAN.

50
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,344
>> THEY USED TO CALL JOHN GOTTI
"THE TEFLON DON,"

51
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:19,722
BECAUSE EVERY TIME THEY'D TRY
AND GET HIM ON SOMETHING,

52
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,516
IT COULD NEVER STICK.

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,309
SO I FEEL LIKE TEFLON DAN.

54
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,436
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
WE DISCUSSED THE ORIGINAL PLAN

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,565
AND VOTE YVE OUT TONIGHT,

56
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,900
BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED
ABOUT DAN'S PERFORMANCE.

57
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,527
IT'LL DEFINITELY BE
A HARD PILL TO SWALLOW

58
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,070
IF DAN COSTS US THE CHALLENGES.

59
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,905
BUT WE'VE MADE OUR DECISIONS,
WE'VE MADE OUR BEDS,

60
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,657
AND WE'VE GOT TO LAY IN IT.

61
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,084
>> ALINA IS STRONG

62
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,045
AND SHE'S VERY SMART.

63
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,047
FROM DAY ONE,
SHE HAD THESE EYES

64
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,424
THAT CAN JUST SEE
STRAIGHT THROUGH YOU.

65
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,427
I NEVER TRUSTED HER AT ALL.

66
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,762
SO WE NEED
TO GET ALINA OUT NEXT.

67
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,805
AND THAT'S FOR SURE.

68
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,931
>> MM-HMM.

69
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,600
>> ALL RIGHT?
>> OKAY.

70
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,320
>> COULD I JUST SAY, WOW! WOW!

71
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,451
>> WE WOULD'VE GONE
WITH WHATEVER

72
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,785
YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE SAID.

73
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,413
>> WE WANTED TO FLUSH THE IDOL,
WAS THE PLAN BUT...

74
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:29,125
>> WHY ANY VOTES ON ME?
WHAT WERE THE VOTES ON ME?

75
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,252
WHAT WAS THAT?

76
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,587
>> YOU HAVE THE IDOL.

77
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,631
>> YOU GOT TO HAVE
BIG, BIG CAJONES

78
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,758
TO PULL THE MOVE
THAT I PULLED TONIGHT,

79
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,636
WHICH IS, I DID NOT PLAY
THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

80
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,513
I SENSED THAT YOU GUYS
WANTED TO FLUSH THE IDOL,

81
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,975
BUT SOMETHING IN MY GUT SAID

82
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,269
THAT THAT WASN'T
TOTALLY BULL ... SO...

83
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,479
I KEPT THAT IMMUNITY IDOL
IN MY POCKET,

84
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,191
AND I DEBATED LONG AND HARD,

85
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,486
AND SOMETHING TOLD ME
HANG ON TO IT, AND I WAS RIGHT.

86
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,947
I ALSO NEED TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF JANE.

87
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,782
OBVIOUSLY,
JANE VOTED FOR ME TONIGHT,

88
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,076
SO THAT'S GOING TO HAVE
TO BE DEALT WITH.

89
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,535
I'M JUST SITTING HERE
SEETHING ABOUT JANE, ACTUALLY.

90
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,371
I HAVE NEVER LIED TO HER ONCE,

91
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,791
I HAVE NEVER MISLED HER,
I'VE NEVER VOTED FOR HER.

92
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,000
SHE TURNED ON ME.

93
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,962
SHE'S A DESPERATE ONE AND SHE
HAS BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING,

94
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:14,837
AND SHE'S GOT TO GO.

95
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,216
>> SHE'S NEXT.
>> SHE'S PISSING ME OFF.

96
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,531
>> HEY, THE ONE THING
I WANTED TO SAY

97
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,284
AFTER LAST NIGHT TO YOU IS...
ACTUALLY, LIKE, THREE THINGS.

98
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,369
ONE IS...

99
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,620
I HAVE NEVER, EVER LIED TO YOU.

100
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,582
UNLESS YOU TELL ME RIGHT NOW YOU
THINK I'VE LIED ABOUT SOMETHING,

101
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,792
I'LL SET IT STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW.

102
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,502
>> I DON'T THINK YOU'VE LIED.
>> I HAVE NEVER...

103
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,129
I HAVE NEVER,
EVER ONCE LIED TO YOU.

104
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,630
I'VE NEVER MISREPRESENTED MYSELF
TO YOU IN THIS GAME,

105
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,799
NOT EVEN ONCE.

106
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,593
I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN
YOUR NAME DOWN,

107
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,429
AND I HAVE NEVER, EVER SUGGESTED
THAT YOUR NAME SHOULD GO DOWN.

108
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,558
THEY ALL TOLD US YOU WERE GOING,
BUT WHEN I SAW EVERYTHING TURN,

109
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,602
THAT'S WHY I TURNED TO YOU
AND SAID, "VOTE FOR BRENDA,"

110
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,646
'CAUSE I WAS, LIKE, THIS
WHOLE THING IS GOING HAYWIRE.

111
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,482
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE IT WAS GOING.

112
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,734
I FELT LIKE
THEY HAD TURNED ON US.

113
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,112
SO I'M NOT REALLY CLEAR
ON WHAT ALL THEIR STRATEGY WAS.

114
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,448
I THINK THEY WANTED
TO FLUSH THE IDOL OUT.

115
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,951
TWO, THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF
KELLY B., BUT THEY WERE WORRIED

116
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,620
THAT KELLY B.
HAD MAYBE COME AND TALKED TO US

117
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,332
AND THAT WE WOULD USE KELLY B.
TO FLIP ON THEM.

118
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,416
>> BE A FOURSOME.
>> RIGHT.

119
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,920
>> AND WE HAD NO IDEA,
I NEVER, EVER HAD A CLUE.

120
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,131
>> I NEVER HAD A CLUE.
NOT AN IOTA.

121
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,133
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I WANT TO KNOW THAT,

122
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,010
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
YOU VOTED FOR BRENDA

123
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,638
AND I THINK YOU WROTE
MY NAME DOWN LAST NIGHT, SO...

124
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,808
(\LAUGHING\)

125
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,152
>> YOU DID?
>> YEAH, I WAS, LIKE,

126
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,446
"I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN
YOUR NAME DOWN, EVER."

127
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,664
>> KELLY B. GOING HOME
BUYS MARTY AND I

128
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,290
ANOTHER THREE DAYS HERE.

129
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,834
I'M HOPING THAT
JANE WILL BE NEXT,

130
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,585
BUT MARTY AND I ARE REALLY,
LIKE, SCRAMBLING AROUND

131
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,256
FROM BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL
TO TRY AND STAY HERE.

132
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,716
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S GOING TO WORK.

133
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,021
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

134
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,697
LA FLOR GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW ESPADA TRIBE.

135
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,659
YVE VOTED OUT
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

136
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,871
GUYS READY TO GET

137
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,330
>> ABSOLUTELY.

138
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,331
>> Jeff:
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

139
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,876
ONE MEMBER OF EACH TRIBE
WILL BE YOUR DEFENDER.

140
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,545
THEY'LL BE STANDING ON A PERCH
IN THE WATER,

141
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,797
WHILE, ONE AT A TIME,
MEMBERS OF THE OTHER TRIBE

142
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,718
LEAP OFF A PLATFORM
AND ATTEMPT TO THROW A BALL

143
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,220
PAST THE DEFENDER INTO THE NET.

144
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,514
EACH TIME YOU GET
A BALL IN THE NET,

145
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,141
YOU SCORE A POINT
FOR YOUR TRIBE.

146
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,727
FIRST TRIBE TO SCORE FIVE POINTS
WINS REWARD.

147
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,769
WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?

148
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,771
>> YES.
>> YEAH.

149
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,690
>> Jeff: TOMORROW MORNING
THE WINNING TRIBE

150
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:06,903
WILL ENJOY
A NICARAGUAN FARM EXPERIENCE.

151
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,113
THAT INCLUDES
A LITTLE HORSEBACK RIDING

152
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,533
AND THE MAKING
OF A FRESH BREAKFAST

153
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,452
WITH TORTILLAS...

154
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,745
EGGS, CHEESE,

155
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,706
AND FRESH MILK
THAT YOU GUYS WILL COLLECT

156
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,959
FROM THE COW YOURSELVES.

157
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,544
WORTH PLAYING FOR?

158
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,754
>> YES!
>> YES!

159
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,923
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LA FLOR,
YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA MEMBER,

160
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,924
SITTING ONE PERSON OUT.
CANNOT SIT OUT

161
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,051
THE SAME PERSON
IN BACK-TO-BACK CHALLENGES.

162
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:30,968
WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?
>> JANE.

163
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,429
>> Jeff: JANE, TAKE A SPOT
ON THE BENCH.

164
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,223
EVERYBODY ELSE, I'LL GIVE YOU
A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE

165
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,807
AND DECIDE WHO
YOUR DEFENDER'S GOING TO BE.

166
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,851
WE'LL GET STARTED.

167
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,649
OKAY, WE HAVE OUR TWO DEFENDERS.

168
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:49,111
FABIO FOR LA FLOR,

00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,397
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

265
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,276
>> REWARD WAS FOR
A HORSEBACK RIDE AND BREAKFAST,

266
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,114
AND... YOU GET TO MILK
YOUR OWN MILK, I GUESS.

267
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,075
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT MAKES SENSE.

268
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,744
YOU GET TO MILK
YOUR OWN MILK, AND...

269
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,870
THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.

270
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,372
WE SHOULD HAVE WON.

271
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,375
AND WE SHOULD BE GOING,
'CAUSE THAT IS AMAZING.

272
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,975
>> WE LOST THE REWARD,
BUT IT MAKES YOU GET UP

273
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,270
AND DO THINGS AND KEEP GOING,

274
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,273
AND THE WORD "QUIT"
IS NOT IN MY VOCABULARY.

275
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,775
I MEAN, I GO AT IT ALL DAY LONG.

276
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,319
I'M A FARMER GIRL
AND FARMER GIRLS HAVE

277
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,613
A STRONG HEART
AND A STRONG WILL.

278
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,282
I CAN DO A WHOLE LOT MORE

279
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,284
THAN MARTY AND JILL
EVER THOUGHT I COULD DO,

280
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,952
SO I'M TRYING TO STAY
IN THE GOOD GRACES

281
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:34,498
OF THE FOUR TRIBE MEMBERS
THAT I HAVE MADE FRIENDS WITH

282
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,000
OVER AT THE LA FLOR TEAM.

283
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,504
SO, YOU KNOW, THEY CAN
LOUNGE AROUND, THAT'S OKAY,

284
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,465
AS LONG AS THEY FEEL
I'M IMPORTANT.

285
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,309
>> I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY DO RIGHT NOW.

286
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,311
I'M NOT GOING
TO TELL THEM TO GET OFF THEIR...

287
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,145
LAZY LITTLE ASSES.

288
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,480
LET THEM SLEEP.

289
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,024
LET THEM SLEEP, LET THEM RELAX.

290
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,110
AS LONG AS WE WIN CHALLENGES,
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

291
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:07,990
>> YOU KNOW, SHE'S A MASTER
FISHER WOMAN, SO HOPEFULLY...

292
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,830
>> THE OLDER PEOPLE
WHO CAME OVER FROM ESPADA

293
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,166
CAN WORK THEIR BUTTS OFF,
FEED ME ALL DAY LONG,

294
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,711
AND, YOU KNOW,
THEY'LL HELP ME GET STRONGER,

295
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,505
SO I LOVE IT. UM...

296
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,050
YOU KNOW, I GET TO STAY HOME
ALL DAY, RELAX,

297
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,134
EAT THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR,

298
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,720
WHILE THEY GO OUT,
THEY WORK HARD.

299
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,639
YOU KNOW,
I GIVE THEM A LOT OF CREDIT,

300
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,016
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A GAME AND, YOU KNOW,

301
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,186
LONG RUN... FOR ME,
WHO STAYS IN THIS GAME

302
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,564
ISN'T A MATTER OF HOW HARD
YOU WORK AROUND CAMP,

303
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,232
IT'S ABOUT HOW LOYAL
YOU ARE TO ME.

304
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,694
>> HOPEFULLY...

305
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,113
FINGERS CROSSED,
WE'LL GET FISH TODAY.

306
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,920
>> WE WON REWARD
AND WE SHOWED UP, AND...

307
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,463
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

308
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,757
I MEAN, I GREW UP
ON A HORSE FARM IN FLORIDA,

309
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,510
AND SINCE MY DAD PASSED AWAY,
WE STOPPED HAVING ANY HORSES

310
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,261
IN OUR BARN, AND THAT
WAS JUST AMAZING FOR ME,

311
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,056
ALL THE EMOTIONS AND EVERYTHING.

312
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,224
YOU GET A LOT OF TIME
TO REFLECT ON...

313
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,061
STUFF THAT YOU MISSED, AND I
REALLY, REALLY MISS MY DAD.

314
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,104
JUST BEING HERE,
THE FIRST REWARD THAT I GET

315
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,314
WAS BEING ABLE TO SPEND IT
ON A HORSE,

316
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,859
WHICH WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE,
'CAUSE IT JUST REMINDED ME,

317
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,111
LIKE, GOD, HE'S JUST HERE,
HE'S WITH ME.

318
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,823
AND IT WAS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE
FEELING, 'CAUSE...

319
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,826
YOU KNOW, I MISS MY DAD, AND...

320
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:36,245
>> HEY, THAT WAS AWESOME!

321
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,747

FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO
IS MILK THE COW.

00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,592
IT'S REALLY EASY, BUT PROBABLY
YOU HAVEN'T TRIED BEFORE.

327

>> NEVER.
>> OKAY, WHAT YOU DO IS,

PRESS ON THE TOP,
AND THEN YOU SQUEEZE DOWN.

I DESERVE THIS ONE.

372

GOING FOR A CLOSER TARGET.

508
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,387
>> YES!
>> Jeff: AND SHE CONNECTS!

509
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,388
>> LET'S GO, BRENDA!

510
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,433
>> Jeff: BRENDA HOPING
TO SCORE FOR LA FLOR.

511
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,809
JUST MISSES.

512
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,936
ESPADA NOW LEADS THREE-ONE.

513
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,564
>> WE NEED TO GO BACK
TO THAT FIRST ONE WE TRIED,

514
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,566
BECAUSE WE SEE
WHERE THE FIRST ONE HIT.

515
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,610
>> WE GOT LITTLE BALLS.
>> I KNOW. I KNOW, BUT...

516
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,111
>> WE GOT LITTLE BALLS.

517
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,780
>> ARE WE GOOD?
WILL YOU TELL US?

518
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,782
>> IT WAS RIGHT ON,
IT WAS JUST TOO SHORT,

519
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,909
SO WE'RE GOING TO GET
MORE MOMENTUM UP HERE.

520
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,953
>> Jeff: BENRY MOVING DOWN
TO THE SECOND LEVEL

521
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:38,745
FOR ESPADA'S NEXT SHOT.

522
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,122
>> COME ON, BENRY!
>> COME ON, BEN!

523
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,167
>> Jeff: BENRY RELEASES.

524
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,127
>> OH, BABY! WHOO-HOO-HOO!
>> Jeff: AND IT CONNECTS!

525
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,963
>> COME ON, GUYS!
>> LET'S GO, GUYS.

526
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,631
>> Jeff:
BRENDA READY FOR LA FLOR.

527
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,258
SHE RELEASES.

528
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:51,800
AND JUST MISSES.

529
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,969
>> OH, MY GOD.

530
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,804
>> Jeff: ESPADA
NOW LEADS FOUR-ONE.

531
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,806
THERE ARE FIVE TILES TO BREAK.

532
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,475
>> I NEED NAY AND DAN TO PULL.

533
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,310
>> PULL UP. RIGHT THERE.

534
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,812
>> YOU GUYS HAVE GOT
TO BOTH TALK ABOUT IT UP THERE.

535
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,148
>> WE ARE. WE'RE BOTH
TALKING ABOUT IT UP HERE.

536
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,691
>> FEELING THAT, BABY.
>> YEAH?

537
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,776
>> YEP LET IT GO.

538
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,195
>> Jeff: ESPADA
COULD WIN IT WITH THIS.

539
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,823
>> OH! JUST BARELY. DON'T MOVE.
>> Jeff: JUST SHORT.

540
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,824
LA FLOR STILL ALIVE.

541
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,703
LA FLOR NEEDS TO SCORE HERE,
TRAILING FOUR-ONE.

542
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,288
>> I'M GOING TO LET IT GO.

543
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,999
>> Jeff: DOWN ON THE THIRD LEVEL
WITH THE BIGGER BALL.

544
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,376
AND IT WORKED--
LA FLOR SCORES!

545
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,962
LA FLOR NOW HAS TWO,
ESPADA AT FOUR.

546
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:29,963
>> YOU WANT TO GO
WITH THE BIG ONE?

547
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,840
>> LET'S TRY A BIG ONE.
>> GO GRAB A BIG ONE.

548
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:36,177
>> HOW DOES IT LOOK FROM THERE
IF I LAUNCH A BIG ONE FROM HERE?

549
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,512
DOES IT LOOK GOOD?

550
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,180
>> Jeff:
ESPADA GOING TO CHANGE BALLS,

551
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,682
GOING WITH
THE BIGGER CANNONBALL.

552
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,350
A LOT OF STRATEGY.

553
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,686
>> THE AIM IS PERFECT, GUYS,
BUT WE'RE OVERSHOOTING.

554
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,188
>> WHEN I WENT DOWN THERE,
THOUGH, IT WAS SUPER SHORT.

555
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,316
>> IT'S GETTING HARD DOWN HERE.

556
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,692
>> Jeff: ESPADA COULD WIN IT
WITH THIS TOSS.

557
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,861
>> YES!
>> Jeff: AND THEY DO!

558
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,864
>> YEAH, BABY!
>> Jeff: ESPADA WINS IMMUNITY!

559
00:26:55,947 --> 00:27:00,035
>> I SHOULD BE A PIRATE!

560
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:00,869
>> YES!

561
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,872
>> I REALLY FELT
LIKE WE HAD THAT.

562
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,708
>> ME, TOO.

563
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,711
>> Jeff:
ESPADA, CONGRATULATIONS.

564
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,760
BACK-TO-BACK WINS, ALINA.
GOT TO FEEL GOOD.

565
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,553
>> IT FEELS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

566
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,722
>> Jeff: NOBODY GOING HOME
FROM ESPADA.

567
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,682
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

568
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,684
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

569
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,941
>> Jeff: LA FLOR,
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

570
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,527
THE EIGHTH PERSON
WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

571
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,155
YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE
OUT WHO THAT'S GOING TO BE.

572
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,865
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

573
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,116
SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

574
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,410
>> LOSING IMMUNITY TODAY,
FOR ME, MEANS THAT WE GO

575
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,913
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND THE WAY
THINGS ARE SHAPING UP,

576
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,040
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE REMAINING LA FLOR MEMBERS

577
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,377
WANT MARTY OR I GONE, AND BEING
THAT HE HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL,

578
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,670
IT WILL PROBABLY BE ME.

579
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,949
>> FABIO.

580
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,785
>> FABIO.
>> FABS.

581
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,953
WHO DO YOU WANT TO GO TONIGHT?

582
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,623
>> WE GOT TO SPLIT...

583
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,042
WE GOT TO PUT THREE ON MARTY,
TWO ON JILL,

584
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,462
MAKE MARTY PLAY THE IDOL, JILL
AND WHOEVER THEY VOTE FOR TIE...

585
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,964
>> WHICH WOULD MEAN A TIE.

586
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,299
>> AND THEN
WE'LL ALL VOTE JILL OUT.

587
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,135
>> OKAY, JANE NEEDS
HER SATISFACTION

588
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,094
OF VOTING FOR MARTY, I THINK.

589
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,638
>> JANE, ARE YOU GOING
TO VOTE FOR MARTY?

590
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:47,100
>> I'M SORRY, I WAS
THE UGLY DUCKLING OVER THERE.

591
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,602
>> YOU'RE A PRIZED POSSESSION
OVER HERE.

592
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:54,607
>> I'M A FIRM BELIEVER,
WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND.

593
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:59,487
MARTY AND JILL HAVE TREATED ME
LIKE I DON'T EXIST FROM DAY ONE,

594
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,990
GOING ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THE ESPADA TRIBE.

595
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,286
I MEAN, I REALLY FELT LIKE
THE UGLY DUCKLING OVER THERE,

596
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,706
AND I KNOW I GAINED
THE RESPECT OF BRENDA,

597
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,542
PURPLE KELLY, FABIO AND SASH.

598
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,670
SO AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
I HOPE MARTY GOES HOME.

599
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:18,548
IT'S STILL ICING ON THE CAKE
IF JILL GOES HOME. (\LAUGHS\)

600
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,967
I WANT THE CAKE,
AND I WANT TO EAT IT, TOO,

601
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,845
AND I WANT BOTH OF THEM GONE.
(\LAUGHS\)

602
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,555
>> WHY DON'T I DO THIS?

603
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:29,017
WHY DON'T I GO UP TO MARTY
AND TELL HIM IT'S GOING TO BE

604
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,394
THREE VOTES FOR YOU,
TWO VOTES FOR JILL,

605
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,354
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE
TO PLAY YOUR IDOL TONIGHT,

606
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,815
OR... I GUARANTEE YOU...

607
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,774
>> YOU WON'T GO HOME.

608
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,194
>> ...JILL WILL GO HOME,
AND GIVE ME THE IDOL

609
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,945
SO THAT WE HAVE IT

610
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,992
>> RIGHT NOW THE GAME PLAN IS,

611
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,037
PUT THREE OF OUR VOTES ON MARTY
AND TWO ON JILL,

612
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,540
AND TELL MARTY, LIKE, "BRO,
YOU GOTTA PLAY THE IDOL NOW,"

613
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,210
SO HE DOES,
AND THEN IT WILL BE A TIE

614
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:59,255
BETWEEN JILL AND WHOEVER
MARTY... AND JILL VOTE.

615
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,050
AND THEN ON THE REVOTE,
JILL WOULD END UP GOING HOME.

616
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,554
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

617
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,848
>> I THINK WE SHOULD
REALLY CONSIDER THIS.

618
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,099
ASK MARTY FOR THE IDOL.

619
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,936
TELL HIM, "YOU'RE SAFE,
GIVE US THE IDOL,

620
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:18,566
WE'LL VOTE OUT JILL,"
AND THEN WE VOTE HIM OUT.

621
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,694
>> THE... THEN THE ONLY PROBLEM

622
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,531
I SEE WITH THAT IS THAT JILL

623
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,075
WILL HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO ALLEGIANCE

624
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,618
OR CONFIDENCE IN US.

625
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,286
>> IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
EITHER WAY.

626
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,789
YOU THINK SHE WILL EVER,
EVER, EVER TRUST US?

627
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,249
WE JUST VOTED OUT MARTY.

628
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,709
>> TH-THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
>> OR-OR WE VOTE OUT HER.

629
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,920
EITHER ONE, THEY DON'T TRUST US,
AND THEY NEVER WILL TRUST US.

630
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,881
THEY'RE NOT THAT DUMB, SASH.

631
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,091
TONIGHT EITHER MARTY OR JILL
IS GOING TO GO HOME.

632
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,635
THAT'S THE PLAN.

633
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,054
SASH AND I ARE BOTH STUCK
ON WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

634
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,099
AND WE'RE WONDERING,
WHAT IF WE COULD BE,

635
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:56,729
LIKE, SUPER MEAN, ASK MARTY FOR
THE IDOL AND VOTE HIS ASS OUT.

636
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,281
>> I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
SUCH A TOUGH DAY, DUDE.

637
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:10,535
SO... WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS...

638
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,289
THEY'LL SPLIT THE VOTE
THREE TO TWO TONIGHT.

639
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,291
>> THREE VOTES FOR YOU;
>> YEAH.

640
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,419
>> TWO VOTES FOR JILL,
>> YEAH.

641
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,129
>> IN HOPES THAT-THE
THE IDOL IS FLUSHED,

642
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,507
>> YEAH.
>> UM, AND THEN IT'D GO TO A TIE

643
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,468
AND THEN IN A TIEBREAKER,
JILL WOULD GO HOME.

644
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,179
>> YEAH.
>> UM, THE OTHER OPTION

645
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,264
TO STRENGTHEN US...

646
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,142
YOU HAND THE IDOL OVER
AND I LOOK YOU IN THE EYE,

647
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,977
MAN TO MAN,
AND SHAKE YOUR HAND

648
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,105
THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT.

649
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,648
>> RIGHT.
YEAH, BUT I...

650
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,150
>> WOULD YOU DO THAT?
>> I'D JUST GO HOME NEXT TIME.

651
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,528
>> LOOK, IF THIS HAPPENS,
IF YOU GIVE IT TO ME,

652
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,865
UM, I'LL LOOK YOU IN THE EYE
AND SHAKE YOUR HAND AGAIN.

653
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,826
IF WE LOSE
THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,

654
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:54,329
I'M GONNA
GIVE YOU BACK THE IDOL.

655
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,919
YOU KNOW, JILL'S
GOING HOME, REGARDLESS.

656
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,838
>> I CAN'T VOTE FOR HER.
>> NO, NO, NO.

657
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,673
>> I HOPE YOUR PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND THAT.

658
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,176
>> NO, NO, NO. YOU...
YOU'LL VOTE FOR...

659
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,303
>> JANE.
>> JANE, BRENDA,

660
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,846
WHOEVER YOU WANT.

661
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:15,183
I THINK IT MAKES SENSE,
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S...

662
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:21,022
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT
TO DO WITH YOUR OWN IDOL, SO...

663
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,399
>> RIGHT NOW I FEEL...

664
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:27,987
ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS IN EVERY...

665
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,031
WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.

666
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,032
IF I KEEP THE IDOL...

667
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,702
I HAVE TO USE THE IDOL
TONIGHT, SO...

668
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,872
I GIVE SASH THE IDOL,
AND MAYBE I GO HOME TONIGHT,

669
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:38,998
MAYBE I DON'T.

670
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,209
I GOT TO GIVE THE IDOL
TO SOMEBODY,

671
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,044
SO I'M EITHER GIVING IT
TO JEFF TONIGHT

672
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,422
OR I'M GIVING IT TO SASH.

673
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,218
A CURSE AT TIMES,
A GOOD THING AT TIMES--

674
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,220
THE IMMUNITY IDOL IS YOURS.

675
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,888
>> THANK YOU, BROTHER.

676
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,391
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER, OKAY?

677
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,267
>> IT'S IN YOUR HANDS.

678
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,227
I'D RATHER GIVE IT TO SASH,

679
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,064
BECAUSE MAYBE,
IF HE LIVES UP TO HIS WORD,

680
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,067
I WOULD MAYBE LIVE
ONE MORE CYCLE.

681
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,569
ONE MORE CYCLE
COULD POTENTIALLY GET ME

682
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,281
TO THE MERGE,
AND THEN THINGS ARE WIDE OPEN.

683
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:19,205
>> WELL, IT TURNS OUT I DON'T
EVEN HAVE TO DIG FOR IDOLS.

684
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,541
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS ASK FOR THEM.

685
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,709
PEOPLE WILL LITERALLY

686
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,086
HAND ME AN IDOL

687
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,548
JUST BECAUSE I MAY OR MAY NOT
KEEP THEM IN THE GAME

688
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,216
A LITTLE LONGER.

689
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,300
MARTY MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

690
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,262
THAT'S PROBABLY HIS BIGGEST
MISTAKE IN THE GAME.

691
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,298
>> Jeff: SO FABIO, BACK-TO-BACK
LOSSES, REWARD AND IMMUNITY.

692
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,259
DOES ESPADA HAVE MOMENTUM?

693
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,470
>> YEAH.
I THINK THEIR SPIRITS ARE UP.

694
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,138
I THINK THEY HAVE MOMENTUM.

695
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,681
I THINK THEY'RE A STRONG TRIBE.

696
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,142
I THINK WE'RE ALSO STRONG.

697
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,936
I THINK TOMORROW OR THE NEXT
REWARD CHALLENGE,

698
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,146
I THINK IT WILL STILL BE AN EVEN
PLAYING FIELD.

699
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,982
BUT, YEAH, THEY'RE FEELING GOOD
RIGHT NOW.

700
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:30,485
>> Jeff: JANE, LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL WAS CRAZY.

701
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,279
PEOPLE BEING SURPRISED,
DOUBLE CROSSES.

702
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,324
WHAT WAS THE VIBE BEFORE
THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL?

703
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,660
>> SOME OF US GOT TOGETHER
AND TALKED;

704
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,164
THE ONES OF US THAT HAVE MESHED
TOGETHER REALLY GOOD,

705
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,332
AND WE MADE A DECISION.

706
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,418
>> Jeff: IS IT OBVIOUS, JANE,
WHO DOESN'T MESH TOGETHER?

707
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,669
WHO'S ON THE OUTSIDE?

708
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,004
>> UH-HUH.

709
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,256
>> Jeff: AND DO THEY KNOW
THEY'RE ON THE OUTSIDE?

710
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,300
>> I THINK SO. MM-HMM.

711
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,843
>> Jeff: MARTY,
DO YOU FEEL THAT?

712
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,179
THERE'S A SENSE OF BEING IN
WITH THE GROUP

713
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,347
AND BEING OUTSIDE OF THE GROUP?

714
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,515
>> YEAH, CLEARLY.

715
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,308
I MEAN, WE CAME IN AS A MINORITY
INTO THIS TRIBE,

716
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,353
AND SOME OF US DID MORE
OF A FLIP-FLOP,

717
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,563
AND SOME OF US JUST TRIED
TO INCORPORATE OURSELVES

718
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,190
WHERE WE FELT WE FIT IN.

719
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,483
>> Jeff: WHO FLIP-FLOPPED?

720
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,692
>> I THINK JANE'S A FLIPPER.

721
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,571
SHE'LL GO WHEREVER THE WIND
BLOWS IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE

722
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,365
THAT SHE SAVES HER OWN SKIN,

723
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,407
AND WE TRIED TO REMAIN STRONG

724
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,536
AND TRIED TO FIT IN
WITH WHOEVER WE COULD.

725
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,037
>> Jeff: "WE" MEANING YOU
AND JILL.

726
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,746
>> JILL AND I, YEAH.

727
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,373
>> Jeff: JANE, FAIR CRITICISM?

728
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,252
>> WELL, WHEN WE BECAME YELLOW,
I BECAME YELLOW.

729
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,420
AND THAT'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.

730
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,048
>> Jeff: BRENDA, COULD YOU FEEL
THAT FROM JANE?

731
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,465
>> TOTALLY.

732
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,217
FROM DAY ONE.

733
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,385
SHE JUST...
SHE'S JUST VERY GENUINE.

734
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,888
SHE NEVER REALLY TRIED TO MAKE
AN ALLIANCE,

735
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,016
IT JUST BECAME
A NATURAL FRIENDSHIP.

736
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,394
>> Jeff: JILL, DO YOU FEEL
THE SEPARATION?

737
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,354
>> OH, DEFINITELY.
FROM THE MINUTE WE GOT TO CAMP,

738
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:52,525
CLEARLY IT'S AN OLD/YOUNG
DIVISION THAT STILL EXISTS.

739
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,235
SO IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING
TO BE PUT IN THAT SITUATION,

740
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,905
BUT IT'S MY OBLIGATION TO PLAY
OUT OF IT IF I CAN.

741
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,365
>> Jeff: MARTY, LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL

742
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,243
THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK
ABOUT THE IDOL,

743
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,287
AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAD IT,
WOULD YOU PLAY IT OR NOT.

744
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,539
DID THAT COME UP AGAIN TODAY?

745
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,915
>> OH, SURE. AND YOU COULD ARGUE

746
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,418
THAT MAYBE IT WAS THE STUPIDEST
MOVE NOT TO PLAY IT

747
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,752
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL

748
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,088
OR YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IT WAS
THE GUTSIEST MOVE.

749
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,216
BUT I WENT WITH MY GUT INSTINCTS
AND DECIDED TO HOLD ONTO IT.

750
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,802
BUT TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, IS THE
FIRST TIME THAT I FEEL LIKE

751
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,431
I MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
THIS EVENING.

752
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,599
I'M AT A DISADVANTAGE NOW.

753
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,603
AND SO DO YOU DO SOMETHING,
TRUST SOMEBODY AND TRANSFER

754
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,439
THE POWER OF THE IDOL, AND MAYBE
IF THINGS WORK OUT AND YOU TAKE

755
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,441
A RISK, IT BUYS YOU A LITTLE
MORE TIME IN THIS GAME, WHICH,

756
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,694
IT'S A CRAZY GAME, YOU NEVER
KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN.

757
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,946
>> Jeff: BRENDA, WORRIED ABOUT
WHERE THE IDOL IS?

758
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,448
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE IDOL IS?

759
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,324
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW PHYSICALLY
WHERE IT IS.

760
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,491
I THINK SASH HAS IT.

761
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,369
>> JEFF, THE IDOL IS IN
MY POCKET.

762
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:52,793
>> I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS IN HIS POCKET.

763
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,630
>> Jeff: SO MARTY, WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE IDOL?

764
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,505
>> IN TALKING TO SASH, WE AGREED

765
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:01,344
THAT I WOULD TRANSFER THE IDOL
TO HIM.

766
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,680
>> Jeff: SO YOU GAVE YOUR IDOL
TO SASH?

767
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,515
>> I DID. IT COULD GO DOWN

768
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,311
AS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST MOVES
EVER OR MAYBE NOT.

769
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,522
>> Jeff: FABIO, REASONABLE OF
MARTY TO BE A LITTLE CONCERNED

770
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,983
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE
JUST MADE A BLUNDER?

771
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,693
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S VERY
REASONABLE

772
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,112
BECAUSE WE COULD EASILY VOTE HIM
OUT TONIGHT.

773
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,155
BUT EITHER WAY,

774
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,493
WE HAVE THE IDOL, SO I THINK
WE COME OUT ON TOP.

775
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,703
>> Jeff: BRENDA, IT'S
INTERESTING THAT FABIO SAYS,

776
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,454
"WE HAVE THE IDOL."

777
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,331
>> I THINK IT'S OKAY TO SAY "WE"

778
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:34,502
BECAUSE THAT IS HOW MUCH
WE TRUST SASH.

779
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,712
>> Jeff: SASH, OF COURSE YOU
THINK THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE

780
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,798
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH IT IN YOUR POCKET.

781
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,758
JUST OUT OF CURIOUSITY,

782
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,511
NOW THAT YOU HAVE IT IN
YOUR POSSESSION FOR THE GROUP,

783
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:47,139
YOU WANT TO GIVE IT TO BRENDA
TO HOLD ONTO?

784
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,558
>> IF THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDE
AS A GROUP,

785
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,852
THEN MAYBE BACK AT CAMP
I MIGHT DO THAT.

786
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,647
AT THIS MOMENT I DON'T THINK
IT SERVES A PURPOSE.

787
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,566
BUT IF THERE'S A TIME
WHEN I LOSE TRUST IN THEM...

788
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,652
I'M SORRY.

789
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,071
IF THERE'S A TIME WHEN THEY LOSE
TRUST IN ME,

790
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,532
THEN I'LL HAVE TO TURN IT OVER
OR I'LL HAVE THE BIGGEST TARGET

791
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,326
ON MY BACK OF THIS ENTIRE TRIBE.

792
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,704
>> Jeff: GOTTA ASK, SASH, YOU
SAID IT, I JUST HEARD IT.

793
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,788
FREUDIAN SLIP?

794
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,332
IF THERE COMES A TIME WHEN YOU
LOSE TRUST IN THEM

795
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,084
AND YOU HAVE THAT IDOL
IN YOUR POCKET?

796
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:19,213
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT TO
SAY, BUT THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

797
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,550
>> Jeff: FABIO, ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE PSYCHOLOGIST FREUD?

798
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,094
>> YES, I'M ACTUALLY A LITTLE
BIT FAMILIAR

799
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,762
WITH FREUDIAN PSYCHOLOGY.

800
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,016
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE WHOLE 90%
OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS

801
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,601
OMING UP ABOVE AND COMING OUT.

802
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,186
>> Jeff: BRENDA,
THAT'S GONNA LINGER

803
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,064
IN YOUR BRAIN FOR A WHILE.

804
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,065
>> YEAH.

805
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,776
I MEAN, IT WAS A SLIP.

806
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,446
>> Jeff: JANE, HOW BIG A MISTAKE
COULD IT BE FOR MARTY TO GIVE UP

807
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:47,408
THAT IDOL TO SASH
BEFORE TRIBAL COUNCIL?

808
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,454
>> WELL, ANY TIME YOU WATCH THIS
GAME AND YOU GIVE UP THE IDOL,

809
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,539
IT COMES BACK TO HAUNT YOU.

810
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,588
>> Jeff: OKAY, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.

811
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,672
JANE, YOU'RE UP.

812
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,780
>> THIS GAME AIN'T OVER YET.

813
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,716
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

814
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,601
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

815
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:59,855
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

816
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,653
ALL RIGHT. ONCE THE VOTES ARE
READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL.

817
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,488
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE

818
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,990
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

819
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:10,574
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

820
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,790
FIRST VOTE, JANE.

821
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,420
JANE. TWO VOTES JANE.

822
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,507
JILL.

823
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,676
TWO VOTES JANE, ONE VOTE JILL.

824
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,847
MARTY.

825
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,142
TWO VOTES JANE, ONE VOTE JILL,
ONE VOTE MARTY.

826
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,019
JILL.

827
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:43,190
THAT'S TWO VOTES JANE, TWO VOTES
JILL, ONE VOTE MARTY.

828
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,695
MARTY.

829
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,196
WE'RE TIED.

830
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,534
JANE HAS TWO VOTES, JILL HAS TWO
VOTES, MARTY HAS TWO VOTES.

831
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,077
ONE VOTE LEFT.

832
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:05,171
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
<i>SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA...</i>

833
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,673
JILL.

834
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,481
>> Jeff: JILL,
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

835
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,776
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

836
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,627
>> Jeff: WELL, IT'S CLEAR FROM
THE VOTE THAT THIS GROUP IS

837
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,670
MAKING DECISIONS
BASED ON LOYALTY.

838
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:52,384
THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG CAN
THAT LOYALTY LAST?

839
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,761
GRAB YOUR TORCHES,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

840
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,638

846
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,963
>> Jeff: SO NAONKA WORKS
OVERTIME TO TEAR EVERYONE APART.

847
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:29,755
>> THAT WAS PRETTY FRUSTRATING
WHEN WE REALIZED

848
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,049
ALL THESE THINGS WERE MISSING.

849
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,218
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

850
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,808
>> UM, REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY THAT I'VE HAD

851
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,603
TO MEET A LOT
OF FANTASTIC PEOPLE.

852
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,437
MARTY, COULD LUCK TO YOU.

00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,481
MY KIDS NEED SOMEONE
TO ROOT FOR NOW,

854
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,483
SO I HOPE YOU GO
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

855
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,651

AND I HOPE
THAT THEY'RE PROUD OF ME

859
