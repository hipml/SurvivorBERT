1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:04,364
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:06,765
There was a twist.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,135
There will be two separate councils.

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,652
Oh my God !

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,259
And the ghosts 
of past mistakes resurface

6
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:19,156
when Donathan played his idol.

7
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:21,430
Sorry, Jenna, I'm playing it for me.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,059
But it was useless.

9
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:24,685
Jenna, the tribe has spoken.

10
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:30,149
Kellyn cast her 
extra vote against Laurel.

11
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:32,933
But it was Michael 
who joined the jury.

12
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:34,710
Michael, the tribe has spoken.

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,616
There are eight left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

14
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:48,870
What happened ?

15
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:50,414
It was disturbing.

16
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,069
Six votes cast 
in a five-man board.

17
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:54,846
Who had one more? 
Not me !

18
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,800
Nor me. 
Nor me.

19
00:00:56,925 --> 00:00:58,694
It must be Kellyn!

20
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,014
Yeah. It was me.

21
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:03,855
Did you vote against me twice? 
I did not understand.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,841
Alright, I sit down.

23
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:08,532
I had one more vote, and tonight,

24
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:11,982
I thought there would be 
one vote for me, one for Laurel,

25
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:14,509
that the three guys 
would be quiet,

26
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:17,238
so I cast my two votes 
against Laurel.

27
00:01:17,363 --> 00:01:20,270
And I understand that 
she is very hurt.

28
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:23,013
I passed 
very close to the exit this evening.

29
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:26,054
And that Kellyn put 
not one, but two votes on me

30
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:28,263
shows that it's every man for himself.

31
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,255
I have to adopt the same attitude.

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,201
Fortunately, Wendell and Dom have stuck with 
me.

33
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:45,992
Over here, everyone!

34
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:56,341
Ready for 
today's reward event?

35
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,563
Today you will have to 
collect a bag of sand,

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,081
then overcome obstacles 
until the finish,

37
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:06,289
where you should place the bag

38
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,656
on a very small table.

39
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:10,864
The first to finish 
wins the reward.

40
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:12,815
Want to know what's at stake? 
Yes !

41
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,243
The winner 
will go to a very beautiful place

42
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,329
where he will taste ribs,

43
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:19,819
chicken, burgers,

44
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:23,839
pastries and ice cream 
for dessert.

45
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,696
Is it worth it ? 
Yes !

46
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:31,984
Do you know what the one thing 
would make it even better?

47
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:34,214
It would be to share it

48
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,761
not only 
with those you play against,

49
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:39,119
but to be able to share it

50
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,793
with those for whom you play.

51
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:43,660
I speak of love!

52
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,126
Wendell, what does it do?

53
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:54,254
Why is love so important 
right now, in this game?

54
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,143
These are the people 
we think about,

55
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:58,860
who we play for.

56
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:01,913
And I know...

57
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:05,035
I know that my father is not far away!

58
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:07,644
So, shall we start with you?

59
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,150
Well, 
let's welcome Wendell's father!

60
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,967
Wendell, come here!

61
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:18,275
I'm proud of you.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,988
You can do it, you know it. 
You are my son.

63
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:23,584
Thank you dad.

64
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,778
Wendell. You are that tough guy 
participating in a tough game.

65
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,538
But seeing your father, 
you become the son.

66
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,830
This guy is everything to me.

67
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:34,982
He's... He's me!

68
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:37,384
It's the original Wendell, the senior.

69
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,113
Look at it, you will see me. 
Look !

70
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:42,864
It's Wendell Senior, 
the guy I told you about!

71
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:44,816
I told you !

72
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,635
He worked so hard.

73
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,139
All the things 
I built on the camp,

74
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:51,422
he taught me how to do it 
in my childhood.

75
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,436
He is everything for me.

76
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:56,411
Wendell senior. 
Where does this pride come from?

77
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,995
He's saying 
you're his hero!

78
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:01,950
He is ours.

79
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,953
He accomplished so much more

80
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,509
in every way, 
than one could have imagined.

81
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:07,884
We are very proud of him.

82
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,989
Well, give him one last hug.

83
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,087
[???] 
I love you.

84
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,289
It's him, it's my rock.

85
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,829
Kellyn, ready for some love?

86
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,443
This is your big brother, Clay! 
Come here, Clay!

87
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,077
Oh, damn it!

88
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,519
You can do it ! You can do it !

89
00:04:36,913 --> 00:04:38,223
We're in Survivor!

90
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:41,942
A big part of building 
our relationship as adults...

91
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,632
We're opposites 
on so many levels

92
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:47,255
except one or two things 
we agree on,

93
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:51,556
Watching the show every week 
cemented

94
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:54,445
rebuilding our relationship 
in recent years.

95
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,492
Thanks to the Survivor family 
for what they did for ours!

96
00:04:58,617 --> 00:04:59,941
One last hug!

97
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:01,685
It's so good to see you!

98
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,727
Donathan.

99
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:05,280
Let's welcome your Aunt Patty. 
Come, Patty!

100
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:10,990
She is cabbage!

101
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,466
I'm so glad 
you came!

102
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,946
You're okay ? 
Good.

103
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,965
Donathan. I've never seen you 
so vulnerable,

104
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,838
and I saw you being.

105
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:27,907
What is the explanation? 
What's going on for you?

106
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:30,119
It means everything to me.

107
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:33,140
I love being on the show,

108
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,497
but having this family contact,

109
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:38,093
it's something 
I will never forget.

110
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:42,011
How are mom and grandma doing? 
Perfectly.

111
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:44,678
Perfectly. Everything is fine, I promise.

112
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,091
Are you worried 
about your family?

113
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:51,216
Clearly. They depend on me. 
Come here, leave them alone,

114
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:54,901
it was risky, so hearing that 
takes a big weight off me.

115
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:58,079
They are doing very well. 
And she sends you lots of love.

116
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:00,863
She gave me this for you. 
Oh thank you !

117
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:03,066
Alright, one last hug! 
I love you !

118
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:04,579
I love you, Patty!

119
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:06,980
You will win !

120
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:10,863
Ready for a little love? 
Yes !

121
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,881
Let's welcome your daughter, Paige. 
Come on, Paige!

122
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:20,840
I'm proud of you !

123
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:31,433
Paige, tell me about your relationship.

124
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:34,980
Our norm is to be separated.

125
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,639
She served 21 years in the army, so...

126
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:40,126
We are used to being apart.

127
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,120
Manage it, manage 
to put our emotions aside

128
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:44,699
and do what is necessary

129
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:48,483
to improve our lot 
and brighten our future.

130
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,670
Angela, your daughter said 
a very interesting thing.

131
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:54,556
You served in our army.

132
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:56,674
And in consequence,

133
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:59,191
you have sacrificed 
your own family.

134
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:04,628
How do you feel 
when your daughter says that?

135
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:07,435
Is it painful 
or is it part of the bond?

136
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,648
A little...

137
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:10,438
A bit of both.

138
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:11,817
Because...

139
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,794
While being very proud,

140
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:18,443
I also suffer 
from leaving my family behind.

141
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,640
Sometimes it feels like they've been 
abandoned.

142
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:26,661
But then when you see 
the amazing young adult that...

143
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:29,991
Everything she's become...

144
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,581
It's my family, 
the real heroine

145
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:34,429
of all that, of my story.

146
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,132
Thank you, little sister!

147
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,557
One last hug! 
I love you !

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,393
Chelsea! Ready for a little love?

149
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:46,884
This is your sister, Sydney. Come !

150
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,126
I told 
you you would bring your butt here!

151
00:07:57,582 --> 00:07:59,582
I miss you so much !

152
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:03,601
Sydney, you weren't here, 
but you see your big sister

153
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:07,208
which is clearly vulnerable. 
Yes. I am very proud of her.

154
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:09,580
She has always been very ambitious.

155
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:12,252
I try to be solid and strong 
for her

156
00:08:12,377 --> 00:08:15,878
when she's in trouble, 
to give her love, and she...

157
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:18,704
everyone loves him. 
And everyone is fine.

158
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,979
She may be 
the most supportive little sister

159
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:22,675
never seen in Survivor!

160
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,014
Is not it ! 
One last hug!

161
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,541
I love you, my darling! 
Me too !

162
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:30,184
Laurel, ready? 
Yes !

163
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,122
Let's welcome your brother Franck! 
Big brother !

164
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,276
It's really difficult !

165
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,391
Laurel, is this 
the expected big brother welcome?

166
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:46,709
Is he your rock?

167
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,253
He is my rock.

168
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:51,306
He helps me through 
the hard times,

169
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,242
because it is always strong 
and resistant and...

170
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,637
It's very hard not to have him here,

171
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:59,645
because here you find people 
you think you can trust,

172
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,538
but I can trust him 100%.

173
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:06,573
To have someone here who you know 
is telling you the truth,

174
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:08,923
and vice versa, it's priceless.

175
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,965
One last hug! 
Come on, come on!

176
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:16,105
You will win ! Go on !

177
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:19,955
You also have a little sister!

178
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,430
Welcome Grace!

179
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,930
I'm proud of you ! 
I miss you so much !

180
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:33,284
You are too pretty !

181
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,519
Between brother and sister, in general,

182
00:09:38,674 --> 00:09:40,559
during childhood, 
we are dog and cat.

183
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,557
And yet, when we come here,

184
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:44,126
it all flies away.

185
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,978
How does it feel 
to kiss your little sister?

186
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:50,112
She is more than my little sister, 
she is my twin.

187
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:52,118
Not for real, but check it out!

188
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,717
We are the same person!

189
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:56,051
It's my best friend,

190
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:59,060
the only one I like to talk 
to at any time of the day.

191
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:03,611
If I had to choose one person 
to spend the rest of my life with,

192
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:07,148
that would be Grace. 
Honey, it's her.

193
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,883
One last hug!

194
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,792
I love you, sis!

195
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,611
More than one person. Domenick.

196
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:16,746
Your woman. The only relative 
without blood ties.

197
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:19,627
You chose this woman 
to build a family.

198
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,337
Kristin, over here!

199
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:36,820
I love you and hate you so much!

200
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:45,012
Can I see your face, 
please?

201
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,606
Domenick. 
Tell me about this relationship.

202
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:51,788
This woman, for giving up 
what she gave up

203
00:10:51,913 --> 00:10:54,705
so that I can 
come here to experience this...

204
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,543
... crazy adventure,

205
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:59,620
something I've 
been a fan of for ages...

206
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:02,493
What more can you ask of 
a woman?

207
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,373
She is my life, my rock.

208
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,708
It's so painful.

209
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:09,978
I suffer so much, 
I don't even recognize myself anymore.

210
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,719
Where does suffering come from?

211
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:15,958
Live without him, 
without talking to him every day.

212
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,363
I hadn't gone a day 
without talking to him in 20 years.

213
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:21,742
We're glad you're here. 
Yes.

214
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:23,632
Thanks. 
One last hug.

215
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,979
Now the stakes are known.

216
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:36,504
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

217
00:11:41,423 --> 00:11:42,836
Well, on and go.

218
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,297
For a reward 
in the form of love.

219
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,317
Survivors, ready?

220
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:53,739
Wendell quickly comes out of the water.

221
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,995
Sebastian on his heels. 
Wendell passes. Sebastian too.

222
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:01,607
Come on, Chelsea! 
Kellyn passes.

223
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:03,065
Come on, Donathan, good!

224
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:05,854
Donathan and Angela, 
always at the start.

225
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:07,487
Domenick, it's good!

226
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:09,955
Everyone else 
is on their sandbags.

227
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,173
You have to undo all the knots.

228
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,636
Donathan...

229
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,578
Oh, big drop! Its good !

230
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,349
Laurel has her bag, she's gone.

231
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,288
Chelsea has hers, she passed.

232
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:26,854
Chels, my baby! Go on !

233
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,874
Laurel and Chelsea are digging. 
It's good for Sebastian.

234
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,172
Come on Sebastian!

235
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,933
Angela waddles forward. 
Give it your all, Angela!

236
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:35,073
Good, mom!

237
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:36,782
Go ahead, you can do it!

238
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:39,500
Kelly's a son sac de sable. 
Wendell a le sien.

239
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,818
Go, mom, go! 
Go on !

240
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:45,156
Angela passed.

241
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:48,426
Domenick, Angela and Donathan 
are on their sandbags.

242
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,353
Everyone else digs.

243
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:51,946
Keep on going ! Dig !

244
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:54,010
Bien, Kellyn, bien !

245
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:55,752
Everyone can win.

246
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:59,168
It remains to place the sandbag 
on a very small table.

247
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:01,492
Domenick has his bag, he's gone.

248
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:03,082
Come on, Dom, come on!

249
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:04,884
This is Donathan.

250
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:06,537
He passed.

251
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:08,649
Angela is on her sandbag,

252
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:10,198
she is last.

253
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,350
Laurel will try to go 
through a very small hole.

254
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:16,075
A little more, come on! 
Not skinny enough!

255
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:19,619
You have to dig under this trunk. 
Come on Sebastian!

256
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,040
Sebastian gives it a shot.

257
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,951
He passed!

258
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,517
He can start tossing his bag.

259
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:33,088
He has a good lead, 
he can take his time.

260
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,023
Dig, mom, dig!

261
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,278
Angela digs now.

262
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:39,394
Chelsea tries to pass.

263
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:42,556
Everyone fights for love!

264
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:45,662
Sebastian can win now.

265
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:49,037
Still too short. 
You are still in the game!

266
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,375
You go-y, you and it is!

267
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,707
Good, Donathan!

268
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,557
Donathan tries to slip out.

269
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:56,210
Domenick tries. As well as Wendell.

270
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,015
Everything remains open.

271
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,983
Go on !

272
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:01,037
Sebastian throws, for the win.

273
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,101
No, it falls!

274
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:09,182
Domenick has passed, 
he can take his sandbag.

275
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,655
My God ! 
Domenick has a chance.

276
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,699
Domenick... It's falling! 
Go on !

277
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:20,218
Come on, there you are!

278
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:23,053
Sebastian... It's falling again.

279
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:24,306
This is Domenick.

280
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:27,394
Oh, just not!

281
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,236
Sebastian succeeds!

282
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:33,020
Sebastian wins love! 
Yeah !

283
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,618
Wow ! 
Well done, sea bass!

284
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:39,777
Everyone fought for it.

285
00:14:44,157 --> 00:14:46,490
Sebastian. 
We know how important it is.

286
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,010
We just talked about it.

287
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:51,741
And you know how it works. 
Choose a person and their loved one

288
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,338
to accompany you.

289
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:56,735
He loves family life so much. 
I have to choose Dom. Come !

290
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:00,764
Come, Kristin!

291
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,083
Alright, Sebastian, 
pick another player .

292
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,409
and his relative to accompany you.

293
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,661
I promised Wendell. 
It must be Wendell.

294
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,801
Wendell, come here! 
Wendell senior, join us!

295
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:17,163
Good Sebastian.

296
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:21,584
Choose one last person 
and their loved one to join you.

297
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,256
Donathan, come on, buddy!

298
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,923
Sorry, girls. 
You deserve it, buddy!

299
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,893
Bien. Kelly's, Laurel,

300
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:34,519
Chelsea, Angela,

301
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:36,582
no more love for you.

302
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:38,845
Loved ones, it's time to go.

303
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:43,448
Good. One more decision to make.

304
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:48,463
Sebastian, you decide 
who goes to Ghost Island.

305
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,521
And today there is a surprise.

306
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:52,603
Car awaits you on Ghost Island

307
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:54,794
an advantage in the game.

308
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:58,117
All you have 
to do is land on Ghost Island

309
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:00,066
and the advantage is yours.

310
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:03,048
You can choose yourself. 
You're the boss.

311
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:06,393
In this case, your sister would leave 
and you would go to the Ghost Island.

312
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,537
If you offer it 
to one of the other three,

313
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:10,543
his relative will leave.

314
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,690
But if you don't choose

315
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,274
one of you four,

316
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,034
power passes to these four, 
who will decide.

317
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,805
Anyway, 
I'm not going to Ghost Island.

318
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,183
But I offer it to you.

319
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:24,822
If you want to go there, you can.

320
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:26,296
Say it to me.

321
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:27,758
I will go.

322
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:31,524
Wendell, you give up

323
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,934
to a potentially unique afternoon

324
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,105
in exchange for an advantage in the game.

325
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,171
Good. Say goodbye to your father.

326
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:39,914
Make them drool! 
Yes.

327
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:43,999
One of us could have gone. 
Wendell senior, it's time.

328
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,107
Wendell, take your things 
and on the way, the boat is waiting for you.

329
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:50,674
Take care of yourself !

330
00:16:51,914 --> 00:16:54,651
Well, Sebastian, Domenick, Donathan 
and your loved ones,

331
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,593
a beautiful afternoon awaits you.

332
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,185
On the way, enjoy!

333
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,124
Kellyn, Laurel, Chelsea, Angela,

334
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,495
nothing for you. 
Take your things, leave.

335
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,817
These guys are so full of themselves

336
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:12,221
that they didn't even bother 
to leave the four of us alone.

337
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:14,311
Get to work, girls!

338
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:32,899
Jeff said, "Go to Ghost Island 
and you're guaranteed an advantage."

339
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:36,028
Although it was great 
to be with my dad,

340
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:39,332
the best man in the world, 
my mentor, my everything,

341
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:43,952
we agreed. He said, 
"Go ahead and earn that money!

342
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:46,557
You have to go 
all out and give it your all!"

343
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:49,492
And in my place, he would have done the same.

344
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,629
"Congratulation !

345
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:56,222
You have earned 
the same “second chance” benefit,

346
00:17:56,382 --> 00:18:00,506
for the same ordeal, 
as Malcolm in season 25,

347
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:05,773
If you drop the ball, 
you are not eliminated.

348
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:08,511
You will replace the marble 
and start over."

349
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,233
Malcolm lost on the bill.

350
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:13,060
He is not eliminated, 
he has a second chance.

351
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,275
"But he lost the ball... 
twice."

352
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:19,109
And suddenly, Malcolm is eliminated.

353
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,931
"He lost the event 
and was eliminated that night."

354
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:23,278
The tribe has spoken.

355
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,757
"He never reached 
the final square again.

356
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,628
This tainted perk 
has been living on Ghost Island for six years.

357
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:32,702
Only question: can you 
reverse the curse?

358
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:37,772
At the next immunity, 
I will have a second attempt

359
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:39,876
if the ball falls, like Malcolm.

360
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:42,260
Such an advantage, in this game,

361
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:43,819
at this stage,

362
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,429
we don't do better.

363
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:47,418
The end is in sight, we all know that.

364
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,798
It means to 
seize, to catch, to grab

365
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:51,939
any advantage that can be found.

366
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,369
I have to be in the final. 
And this brings me closer.

367
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:02,198
Dom, ready to eat? 
God's goodness !

368
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:05,360
I am blessed to have my wife here.

369
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,710
But despite my desire 
to be with her,

370
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:10,260
this is an opportunity 
to talk to people

371
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:12,985
and say, 
"This is our chance to unite!"

372
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,784
We're holding something here.

373
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:17,880
And with friend Wendell 
working for us on Ghost Island,

374
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,860
we work well together.

375
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:22,174
And I tell you, Aunt Patty,

376
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,324
I will go to the end with them. Really.

377
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:26,560
I take you at your word! 
It is said !

378
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:30,260
I am a country girl! 
I know it !

379
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:33,068
Domenick and Sebastian 
were drawing their plans,

380
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:35,260
now that we're together.

381
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:37,159
But they are the most dangerous.

382
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:39,450
And I don't know 
if good old Donathan

383
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:41,871
can take on and defeat 
these tough guys.

384
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:45,360
At the last tip, 
I wasted my idol.

385
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,919
Now 
I have to be more aggressive.

386
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:50,385
I must eliminate one of these targets.

387
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:03,307
Let's have a girls meal.

388
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:06,382
Shit, we can do whatever we want

389
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:08,685
without them 
to give us orders!

390
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:13,108
The three guys got together 
and left for the reward

391
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,729
or seek benefits 
on Ghost Island,

392
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:18,260
and left us here 
to do the dishes.

393
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:21,784
And guess what he's doing here?

394
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:25,280
He laughs at you 
because he gets a new advantage.

395
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:27,860
He doesn't care if he 
deprives someone of his family.

396
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:29,437
And it pisses me off!

397
00:20:30,385 --> 00:20:31,885
Everything works for them.

398
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,084
They win immunity, 
maybe have idols,

399
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,620
see their loved ones...

400
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:40,396
Wendell goes to Ghost Island, 
assured that everything will be fine for him.

401
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:44,159
We can blame them, be sad 
not to see our loved ones,

402
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:48,084
or seize the opportunity 
to take full control of the game.

403
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:50,284
But their plan for the day has a flaw.

404
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,760
They left us here.

405
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,385
How many ? 
Four. A majority.

406
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:58,729
If we can rally Donathan... 
Yeah.

407
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:00,084
It's OK for me.

408
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:04,269
Who goes out first, then? 
I would say: separate Dom and Wendell.

409
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:07,151
For us, there, 
it's quits or double.

410
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:10,060
This is the only opportunity 
to take the majority from them.

411
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,084
Dom and Wendell are in charge.

412
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:19,459
The four girls plus Donathan, 
we can unite and break this duo.

413
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:21,885
We'll make you smile.

414
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:26,385
Take care, guys. 
You will be entitled to it.

415
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:30,760
It will only work 
if they don't suspect a thing.

416
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:33,084
They don't even have to consider it.

417
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:36,260
But targeting Wendell first 
worries me,

418
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:39,719
because I think he potentially has 
more tricks up his sleeve.

419
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:41,695
So, we leave Dom. 
Yeah.

420
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,485
This is the shot to play.

421
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,959
Kellyn would want my trust after 
targeting me at the last tip.

422
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:50,805
But it is of interest.

423
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,284
We can be mutually 
useful to each other.

424
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:55,438
You can start 
playing to win.

425
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:57,560
I agree. I agree.

426
00:21:57,685 --> 00:21:59,393
The problem is that I know

427
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,159
that Domenick and Wendell 
each have an idol.

428
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:05,560
So it's scary, but finding 
another option is tempting.

429
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:07,764
I can join the girls

430
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,485
and target one of the guys.

431
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:13,258
Hoping 
to avoid a backlash.

432
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:30,963
Over here, everyone!

433
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:44,543
And this is Wendell, 
back from Ghost Island.

434
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:49,843
Hi. 
Hi.

435
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:53,691
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

436
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:56,520
First of all, 
I take back the necklaces.

437
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:57,981
Both.

438
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:01,585
Thanks, Dom.

439
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:04,243
Thank you, Chelsea.

440
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:10,618
Once again, 
individual immunity is at stake.

441
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:13,006
Today, 
using two handles,

442
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:15,618
you will balance a marble 
on a wooden cylinder.

443
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:19,184
Regularly we will add 
sections to the cylinder,

444
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,218
increasing the difficulty.

445
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:23,843
If you drop the ball,

446
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,317
it's lost.

447
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:28,320
Last to stand wins immunity,

448
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:32,665
makes sure to have a one in seven chance 
of going to the end.

449
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,263
The Losers: On the council, someone 
will become the sixth member of the jury.

450
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:40,218
Wendell, read us your advantage.

451
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:42,243
Yes, I have an advantage.

452
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:46,718
"If you knock the ball down, 
you're not out.

453
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,306
You will replace the marble 
and start over."

454
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,406
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

455
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:02,549
Let's go. Grab your handles!

456
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:08,118
I'm doing the count, 
the cylinder should be in the air.

457
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:09,259
Three...

458
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:10,464
... of them...

459
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:11,786
... and...

460
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:15,425
Everyone looks good 
with their first section.

461
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,269
The test is on.

462
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,642
Three cylinder sections

463
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:24,942
that you are trying to hold 
between two handles.

464
00:24:25,127 --> 00:24:26,873
In the center, a small ball,

465
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,743
who wants to move, 
one way or the other.

466
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:33,743
Domenick moves a little 
but recovers well.

467
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,043
Things are moving a bit at Wendell.

468
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:41,642
It can move anywhere, 
as long as it doesn't fall.

469
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:44,767
It will depend on your balance

470
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:47,330
and the pressure exerted 
on the handles.

471
00:24:52,043 --> 00:24:54,817
Kellyn loses his marble. 
No immunity for her.

472
00:24:54,942 --> 00:24:58,118
Go to the bench. 
Kellyn is the first eliminated.

473
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:00,243
You are only seven.

474
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:02,790
We will stay ten minutes 
on this section,

475
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:04,208
then we will continue,

476
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:06,961
and it will become 
much more interesting.

477
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:16,809
ELAPSED TIME: 10 Minutes

478
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,391
Alright, next round! 
ELAPSED TIME: 10 Minutes<br>

479
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:21,275
Pose and relax.

480
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:23,942
Let's add a section 
to your cylinder.

481
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:29,877
I count again. 
You must have raised before zero.

482
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:31,343
Let's go.

483
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:32,697
Three...

484
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:33,972
... of them...

485
00:25:34,261 --> 00:25:35,243
... and...

486
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:37,442
Lift up, Angela!

487
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:41,252
Angela couldn't lift in time.

488
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:43,142
Angela is eliminated.

489
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:47,118
Wendell loses his ball. 
He has a second chance.

490
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:48,517
Everyone rest!

491
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:51,218
Everyone is quiet. 
We start the round again.

492
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:54,967
Wendell uses his advantage, 
takes his second chance.

493
00:25:55,217 --> 00:25:57,142
Let's go. I count.

494
00:25:57,743 --> 00:25:58,779
Three...

495
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,271
... of them...

496
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:02,442
... a... You have to lift!

497
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:04,942
Everyone is good, here we go again.

498
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:09,215
You are only six. 
Wendell used his advantage.

499
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,642
But will it help him?

500
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:15,543
Things are already moving a little at Wendell.

501
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:17,942
But he recovers.

502
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,243
It is necessary to make sure 
to exert equivalent pressures,

503
00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:25,638
not to overtighten the cylinder,

504
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:27,942
or it will collapse.

505
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:34,243
Wendell loses his ball, 
he is eliminated.

506
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,843
The curse is maintained, 
the advantage did not help him.

507
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:41,630
Wendell is vulnerable on the board.

508
00:26:41,755 --> 00:26:43,642
He sits on the bench.

509
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:50,111
ELAPSED TIME: 20 Minutes

510
00:26:50,112 --> 00:26:51,536
Alright, round over. 
ELAPSED TIME: 20 Minutes<br>

511
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:53,918
Relax. 
We go to the last round.

512
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:55,642
Good boy ! 
Good boy !

513
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:57,642
Replace your items.

514
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:00,966
Take back your handles.

515
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:02,938
Prepare yourself mentally.

516
00:27:04,043 --> 00:27:05,118
On and go.

517
00:27:05,243 --> 00:27:06,267
Three...

518
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:07,425
... of them...

519
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,614
... and...

520
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:12,243
The last round 
of this event is launched.

521
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:15,049
We will only stop 
when there is a winner.

522
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:19,743
Things are moving at Laurel. Well recovered.

523
00:27:20,243 --> 00:27:23,418
If you're shaking, 
you have to quickly regain control.

524
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:26,558
Big movement at Domenick, 
but he recovers.

525
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:29,517
You jump a little, 
squeeze too hard,

526
00:27:29,642 --> 00:27:31,811
have the slightest contraction,

527
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,343
and it's done.

528
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:37,942
And suddenly, Sebastian loses his ball!

529
00:27:38,343 --> 00:27:40,243
You are only four.

530
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:43,849
You can't get away 
from this ordeal.

531
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:47,243
And the room for maneuver is small.

532
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:52,952
Laurel loses her marble, 
she is eliminated.

533
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,908
You are only three. 
It's accelerating.

534
00:27:56,243 --> 00:28:00,043
Domenick, right next to Chelsea, 
and at the very end, Donathan.

535
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:05,178
Stability, focus. 
Stay in control at all times.

536
00:28:07,543 --> 00:28:11,223
Domenick continues 
to analyze the position of his hands.

537
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:13,970
Donathan 
begins to shake a little.

538
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:19,611
Suddenly, Chelsea loses her ball.

539
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,453
His streak of immunity victories comes to an 
end.

540
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,041
And it's face-to-face.

541
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:27,043
Domenick versus Donathan.

542
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,260
Domenick 
begins to shake a little.

543
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:38,343
He's shaking more.

544
00:28:40,043 --> 00:28:42,072
Donathan keep shaking

545
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:44,731
but continues 
to stand the test.

546
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:47,343
Keep on fighting!

547
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:56,118
Donathan can't do it anymore!

548
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:59,930
Domenick wins 
his second individual immunity!

549
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:02,118
Safe at tonight's council.

550
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:04,796
A guaranteed place 
in the last seven.

551
00:29:07,343 --> 00:29:09,043
That was a battle!

552
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,243
Domenick, come here!

553
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:17,918
Once again, 
immunity is yours.

554
00:29:18,043 --> 00:29:21,340
Safe on the board again, 
you can't be knocked out.

555
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,942
Unfortunately for you, 
after 32 very difficult days,

556
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:29,017
someone will become 
the sixth member of the jury.

557
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,691
Take your things, leave. 
Congratulation !

558
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:35,554
Naviti's happy family 
is really over.

559
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:38,420
The Naviti girls 
will attack the Naviti boys.

560
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:39,984
And Laurel and Donathan

561
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:42,918
are the most popular articles on Lavita.

562
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:45,982
Everyone needs 
their votes. The game is started.

563
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:47,833
It's up to Laurel and Donathan to play.

564
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:01,047
Well done, Dom.

565
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:02,778
Cheer ! 
I was shaking.

566
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:04,942
Cheer. 
Well done, sir!

567
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,952
I did not win immunity.

568
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:09,464
And not having 
made fruitful the advantage,

569
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:12,261
I gave up seeing my father 
for nothing.

570
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:15,715
But I trust my alliance.

571
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,277
We should be 
able to take out whoever we want.

572
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:20,566
At the reward, yesterday,

573
00:30:20,716 --> 00:30:22,738
it was Donathan, Sea Wolf and me.

574
00:30:22,885 --> 00:30:26,007
I said, "We should work together, 
and our friend Wendell

575
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:29,341
is on Ghost Island, 
working for us."

576
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:32,928
So, the four of us plus Laurel, 
we can do business.

577
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:34,413
What do you want to do ?

578
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:36,103
Let's eliminate Chelsea.

579
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,198
So that'll be five... 
Five on Chelsea.

580
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:41,879
We act as if the Naviti 
remained united,

581
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:44,523
but in reality, tonight, 
we're going out Chelsea,

582
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:48,321
because it is important to remove 
the people who dominate the tests

583
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,004
so that they don't worry us 
afterwards.

584
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,491
Let's keep moving forward.

585
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,534
So what's the plan?

586
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,767
They form a block, let's separate them.

587
00:30:57,892 --> 00:30:59,851
So, are we targeting Wendell?

588
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:02,821
I will follow your choice, 
but I would prefer Wendell.

589
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,991
See Dom win immunity

590
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:07,064
comforted me in the idea

591
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:09,698
that the three boys 
have too much power.

592
00:31:09,823 --> 00:31:13,308
If I can pull this off with the girls 
and get Wendell out,

593
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:16,989
this will be my sweetest victory 
in Survivor so far.

594
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:19,507
We all know what to do:

595
00:31:19,632 --> 00:31:21,881
play "welded Naviti".

596
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:25,589
I walk. Unless you tell me 
something's changed,

597
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:27,995
I will follow the plan. 
I'm 100%.

598
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,606
We can rally Donathan.

599
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:31,997
Donathan would follow us, do you think? 
Yeah.

600
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:37,799
This is our plan. 
We spoke to Laurel yesterday.

601
00:31:37,924 --> 00:31:39,558
Hey, hi, Chelsea,

602
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:40,741
Kelly's...

603
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:43,048
...and Laurel.

604
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:49,817
Tonight, 
the boys are not suspicious.

605
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,024
This is our chance. I mean...

606
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:55,036
Of course, you do 
what you want tonight,

607
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:58,223
but I hope... 
I'm in for Wendell.

608
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:00,753
Wendell is excellent 
in the trials.

609
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,584
And he's smart.

610
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:06,088
For me, it is the most dangerous 
at this stage.

611
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:09,982
We think our only chance 
is to do it now.

612
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:11,674
It involves trapping him.

613
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:14,392
We must not alarm them. 
It will happen.

614
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,697
It's gonna be fucking epic!

615
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,189
So tonight: Chelsea.

616
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,546
Yeah. 
And then we will have the majority.

617
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:28,161
We'll take them out one by one.

618
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:30,541
Sebastian is in? 
He told me.

619
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,360
As long as Don-Don is with us... 
He is.

620
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,536
No worries. 
He follows us.

621
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:38,358
I trust Laurel a lot, 
and I need her tonight.

622
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:42,428
But I don't get 
the usual good vibes from her.

623
00:32:42,553 --> 00:32:44,265
So, I have the idol in my pocket,

624
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,113
unpacked, ready to go.

625
00:32:46,238 --> 00:32:50,006
At the slightest glance, 
I draw it and I shoot.

626
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:56,376
If we follow them and take out Chelsea,

627
00:32:56,501 --> 00:33:00,457
we will have the opportunity, at the next move, 
to attack Dom or Wendell.

628
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:03,375
They are the most serious 
candidates for victory.

629
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:07,477
For me, tonight is an opportunity 
to target one.

630
00:33:07,602 --> 00:33:11,059
My worst regret would be not 
having done it when it was possible.

631
00:33:11,184 --> 00:33:13,044
It's a hell of a decision.

632
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:17,143
Laurel and I, we are well placed, 
in the center of everything,

633
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:19,652
There's Wendell and Dom, 
with Sebastian,

634
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:21,465
and the three Naviti daughters,

635
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,862
pulling us here and there, 
Laurel and me.

636
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:26,599
I don't know how it's gonna turn 
out tonight,

637
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:29,942
but I'm afraid that my choice 
could turn against me.

638
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,588
I'm afraid we're out 
of strategy, after that,

639
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:35,444
if Dom and Wendell 
keep crushing everyone.

640
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:36,902
Want to follow them?

641
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:41,370
I do not know. I want 
to play it all out.

642
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:44,107
Here, I don't know what to do.

643
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:47,457
On the one hand, I have the guys, 
who I think I can trust,

644
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:49,772
but which I doubt I can beat.

645
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:54,439
On the other, the girls, whom I think I 
can beat in the final.

646
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:57,455
But can I trust them 
to get me there?

647
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,181
Plus, I know Domenick and Wendell 
protected by a ton of idols.

648
00:34:05,306 --> 00:34:08,163
This is probably the last opportunity 
to target one of them

649
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:09,789
without them expecting it.

650
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,596
Donathan and I 
both control this board,

651
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:14,584
and the direction of the rest of the game.

652
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:16,576
This decision is essential.

653
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,599
Now here are the members of the jury.

654
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,156
and Michael, 
eliminated at the last council.

655
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,721
Kellyn, after the last advice, 
on the way back to camp,

656
00:34:59,846 --> 00:35:02,126
are there any fallouts? 
What's the vibe?

657
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:05,651
After this big double board 
where two people left,

658
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:09,356
some were injured. 
I put two votes on Laurel.

659
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,321
She didn't expect it.

660
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:14,526
So that kind of weighed down the mood a bit , I think.

661
00:35:14,651 --> 00:35:17,607
Donathan. 
Do you always feel

662
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:21,044
that Naviti still has the majority?

663
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:24,065
Laurel and I are at 
the bottom again,

664
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,084
but there is a commotion 
among the Naviti,

665
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,762
and she and I 
realize that, so...

666
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:32,592
So there might be 
an opening

667
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:35,592
among the six Naviti. 
There's one tonight.

668
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,697
This assertion 
has brought all Naviti

669
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:45,835
to squint at each other.

670
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:48,066
I see it, and I'm one of them!

671
00:35:48,191 --> 00:35:50,265
To see how everyone 
looks at each other,

672
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,029
I worry 
about what will happen tonight.

673
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:56,947
Well, I do not know. 
I'm shaken here.

674
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:59,484
Kellyn. 
You too seem concerned.

675
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:02,527
What do you feel ? 
Do you believe what he said?

676
00:36:02,652 --> 00:36:03,790
uh well...

677
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:06,625
A bombshell of truth 
came from that corner

678
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,924
to every advice 
I made with him,

679
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:11,072
so my heart is racing.

680
00:36:11,197 --> 00:36:13,463
Laurel. Donathan included you

681
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,699
in this discussion on: 
"Oh yes, there is an opening!"

682
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:20,144
There is an opening, a fault, 
and we have found the way.

683
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:23,403
We therefore hope to be 
able to cash this check this evening.

684
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:24,542
Let's go !

685
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,928
Chelsea. 
You also look around.

686
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:30,404
Yes. At the two previous councils, 
I had a necklace around my neck.

687
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:33,082
There, I am more vulnerable.

688
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:37,047
So if I hear somebody say 
there might be a rift

689
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:39,856
I'm trying to figure out 
what exactly is going on,

690
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,722
if anything has changed.

691
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:44,490
I will be clear. 
These girls approached me.

692
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:46,981
And these guys approached me.

693
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:48,333
This is the flaw.

694
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:52,199
Domenick. It was categorical.

695
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:55,144
But I would like to mention 
one thing that we forget:

696
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:57,623
yesterday, during the 
family reward,

697
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:01,990
these four women spent 
an afternoon together.

698
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:05,343
And if these three 
can speak to her, to her,

699
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:07,098
and that she is with him...

700
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:10,794
What's going on here 
is a very confusing mess.

701
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:13,656
And this necklace 
is very pleasant to me, there.

702
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:16,841
Wendell. Do you wonder

703
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:19,146
if Donathan 
is just showing off?

704
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,506
I don't really know what he's talking about,

705
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:25,400
but we come to know 
that Donathan hardly holds his tongue

706
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:28,299
and that he is ready to drop bombs 
on the board.

707
00:37:28,424 --> 00:37:31,726
We will have to live with it 
and do what we have to do.

708
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:33,912
Kellyn. It would be unrealistic

709
00:37:34,037 --> 00:37:36,022
not to imagine that everyone here

710
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:38,782
did not consider: 
"What if I changed things?

711
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:41,043
What would it be?" 
No?

712
00:37:41,168 --> 00:37:43,162
Yes. It boils down 
to a fairly small group

713
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:47,534
to be able to discuss by considering 
each person, each test,

714
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:51,244
so all brains 
must be on high alert,

715
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:55,117
and the visit of the families 
deviated me a little from the path.

716
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:59,191
I was thinking of coming to play Survivor 
thinking, "I'm home."

717
00:37:59,316 --> 00:38:02,547
Then to see something 
that really comes from home,

718
00:38:02,672 --> 00:38:05,120
it's a huge...

719
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:06,676
An upheaval.

720
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:08,762
We all consider scenarios

721
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,407
with different people.

722
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:13,750
Chelsea. Are we at a stage in the game 
where it's actually

723
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,592
to wait and see 
who will switch sides first?

724
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:19,844
Yes. It's like 
a giant bumper car track.

725
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:23,342
And you don't know who's loyal to you 
and will get out of your way

726
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,283
and who's going to run into you.

727
00:38:25,408 --> 00:38:27,346
Domenick. It's a great picture.

728
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,366
Do you have this feeling 
that anything is possible tonight?

729
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:33,249
It's exactly that.

730
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:35,232
People act not only

731
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:38,830
to make sure to go further,

732
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:42,204
but can also consider a shot

733
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:44,782
which would enrich their CV.

734
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,807
So will I wait 
for someone to come after me

735
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:50,970
or shoot first ' 
cause I don't wanna sit there

736
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,783
when I could have avoided 
it at the right time?

737
00:38:53,908 --> 00:38:57,456
Donathan. What are the odds 
of a surprise elimination tonight?

738
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,778
If it turns out the way I believe

739
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,966
then there might be one.

740
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,425
Well, it's time to vote.

741
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,073
Angela, over to you.

742
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:49,582
I will count the votes.

743
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,072
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

744
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:07,072
now is the time to do it.

745
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,301
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

746
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:23,006
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

747
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,477
I will read the votes.

748
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:37,168
Wendell. 
Two votes Wendell.

749
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:41,268
Chelsea. Equality.

750
00:40:41,393 --> 00:40:43,422
Two Wendell votes, 
two Chelsea votes.

751
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:47,591
Wendell. 
Three votes Wendell.

752
00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:52,966
New equality. 
Three Wendell votes,

753
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:55,293
three votes Chelsea, 
two votes left.

754
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:00,982
Chelsea. 
Merde.

755
00:41:01,107 --> 00:41:03,236
Four Chelsea votes, 
three Wendell votes.

756
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,522
One vote remains.

757
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:10,874
Thirteenth person eliminated 
and sixth member of the jury:

758
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:12,816
Chelsea. 
Bring me your torch.

759
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,166
Nice battle, sir. 
Nice game, ma'am.

760
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:29,149
Chelsea, the tribe has spoken.

761
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:33,121
It's time to go.

762
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:45,551
This advice answered the question: 
there is indeed a fault.

763
00:41:45,858 --> 00:41:48,241
The new question is: 
what now?

764
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:51,134
Take your torches, 
return to the camp. Good night.

765
00:42:05,828 --> 00:42:09,018
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

766
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:14,292
Next time in Survivor...

767
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:16,787
When you're caught 
in the bag...

768
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:17,863
What ?

769
00:42:17,988 --> 00:42:20,464
I have to play it all out.

770
00:42:20,627 --> 00:42:22,584
... the consequences 
can be terrible.

771
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,235
We can target Domenick.

772
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,665
If Donathan wants to blow it all up,

773
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,887
maybe that's my ray of hope.

774
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:31,914
What is he going to do ? 
He got out of control!

775
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:34,851
As a fan, 
I'm super grateful.

776
00:42:34,976 --> 00:42:38,435
I actually have no regrets 
for this advice.

777
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,407
I wanted to make a big hit tonight

778
00:42:41,532 --> 00:42:44,670
and I'm proud to have tried it.

779
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,430
Even though it didn't work out 
in my favour,

780
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:50,100
I'll be gone with a bang

781
00:42:50,225 --> 00:42:51,809
and fighting.
