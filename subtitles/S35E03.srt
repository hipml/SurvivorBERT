I HAVE THE IDOL COULD ABSOLUTELY

SIMONE'S CLOTHING WAS UP FOR
GRABS.

00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,753
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A YARD SALE.

26
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,131
SHE LEFT A LOT OF OF CLOTHING
HERE, INCLUDING A NICE PAIR OF

27
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:30,882
BOOTS, A NICE PAIR OF PANTS, A
BLAZER.

28
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,343
IT'S LIKE YOUR "MIAMI VICE"

33
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,145
>> ZIP THEM UP.

34
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,689
>> ZIP ME UP.

35
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,358
THE PRACTICALITY OF THE
KNEE-HIGH BOOTS IS, IT GOES ON

00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:54,239
I MEAN, YOU COULD AVOID CRACK
WHEN DOES YOU'RE IDOL SEARCHING.

37
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:59,869
FINALLY, SIMONE IS SHOWING HER
WORTH IN SOME CAPACITY.

47
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:20,557
SHE'S IN THE SAME AGE RANGE AS
US, SO THAT'S A KNOCK ON LAUREN.

I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS
ANYTHING GOING ON WITH LAUREN,

MOVES OUT LOUD.

172
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,892
ALAN JUST DOESN'T SEEM LOOK A
SAFE BET.

173
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,436
>> RIGHT, BUT NEITHER DOES JP.

174
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,147
JP IS JUST A PUPPY WAITED TO BE
LED SOMEWHERE.

175
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,483
>> BUT HE CAN BE OUR PUPPY.

176
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,777
>> YEAH, BUT--
>> WE COULD TRAIN HIM.

177
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,656
>> BUT ANYONE ELSE WITH A PIECE
OF MEAT DANGLING IN FRONT OF HIS

178
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:51,989
FACE.

179
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:52,782
>> RIGHT.

180
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,950
>> HE'S GOING TO GO TOWARDS
THEM.

181
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:58,996
>> YEAH, BUT I FEEL LIKE ALAN
WOULD DO THE SAME "MY TRIBE

182
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,789
THINKS I'M CRAZY."

183
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,625
>> OH, YEAH.

184
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,336
ASHLEY IS TOSSED TO A POWER
COUPLE.

185
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,005
WHAT'S THAT IS THE TRUTH OR THE
WHOLE ALAN THING BUT I CAN'T

186
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,300
FULLY TRUST ASHLEY AT THIS POINT
BECAUSE SHE KEEPS PUG FOR JP TO

187
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,844
STAY IN THE GAME, WHICH MAKES ME
THINK JP AND ASHLEY ARE STILL

188
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,639
WORKING TOGETHER.

189
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:30,736
NORMALLY, AS A POWER COUPLE ON
"SURVIVOR" TDON'T WORK OUT GOOD.

190
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,280
>> SURE.

191
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,489
>> ARE WE BRINGING THIS BAG?

192
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:38,119
>> WE CAN BRING BOTH BAGS IN
CASE WE CATCH THIS BIG FISH.

193
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:38,828
I'M FEELING GOOD.

194
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,954
WE'VE WON EVERY CHALLENGE.

195
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,497
WE ARE A DOMINANT TRIBE.

196
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,082
LIFE AT CAMP IS GREAT.

197
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,168
EVERYONE IS STILL ON THE SAME
PAGE, WITH MIKE BEING THE NUMBER

198
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,336
ONE VOTE-OUT.

199
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,672
I GOT EVERYONE BELIEVING MIKE
HAS THE IDOL.

200
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,675
SO I'M COOL AND CONFLICTED RIGHT
NOW.

201
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,344
I MEAN, THINGS COULDN'T REALLY
GO BETTER AT THIS POINT.

202
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,015
THE ONLY THING IS COLE KNOWS I
HAVE THE IDOL SO THAT'S A

203
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,141
CONCERN OF MINE.

204
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,768
I DON'T THINK COLE HAS TOLD
ANYBODY BUT I'M DEFINITELY

205
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,604
CONCERNED ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH JESSICA.

206
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,731
THEY HAVE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF
TIME TOGETHER, FISHING AND

207
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:07,857
THINGS LIKE THAT.

208
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,028
COLE IS LIKE A LOVE BIRD, AND
THAT LOVE BIRD DISEASE IS

209
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:12,611
DANGEROUS.

210
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:21,245
IT'S WORSE THAN THE FLU.

211
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:27,877
♪ ♪ ♪
>>> THE FISHING EXPERIENCE IS

212
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,213
100% BONDING FOR COLE AND I
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY THE ONLY

213
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,049
TIME WE GET TO BE ALONE,
TOGETHER.

214
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,885
AND WE'RE REALLY FORMING A
CONNECTION.

215
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,845
>> GOT ONE.

216
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,138
>> THEY'RE BITING!

217
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,432
I SHOULDN'T HAVE STAYED DOWN
THERE, THAT LONG.

218
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,558
YOU COULD HAVE HAD, LIKE, FIVE.

219
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:45,311
BUT THEN LIFE OUTSIDE OF
"SURVIVOR" I MOVE LIKE A SLUG

220
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,438
WHEN IT COMES TO ROMANCE.

221
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,982
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I
KNOW WHAT ROMANCE MEANS.

222
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:54,695
TO BE HONEST, I COME FROM A
SUPER-RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND, AND

223
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,488
I AM A VIRGIN.

224
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,741
OH, MY GOD, I REALLY-- IT'S
AWESOME.

225
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,910
I COULD STAY DOWN THERE FOR A
REALLY LONG TIME.

226
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:07,124
SO MY FACE FEELS RED THINKING
ABOUT HIM THINKING ABOUT ME.

227
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,960
BEING A COUPLE ON "SURVIVOR" IS
HARD.

228
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,753
AND IT'S DANGEROUS.

229
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,589
SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND
SEE.

230
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:18,928
WE HAVE A LONG TIME LEFT
TOGETHER, I HOPE.

231
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,597
>> ARE YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF?

232
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,474
>> YEAH, I'M HAVING A BLAST.

233
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,601
I LIKE TO BE OUT HERE.

234
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,435
LIKE, AWAY FROM THE GAME.

235
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,311
>> UH-HUH.

236
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,106
>> I FEEL LIKE I CAN LET MY HEAD
BREATHE.

237
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,400
>> I'LL SHUT UP ABOUT THE GAME
THEN.

238
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,275
>> NO, NO, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE GAME.

239
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,611
>> I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT
YOU'RE SAFE.

240
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,278
>> YEAH.

241
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,781
I BETTER BE.

242
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,950
YOU CAN'T GET TO THE END WITHOUT
ME.

243
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,788
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT!

244
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,833
BUT I 100% KNOW THAT MIKE
DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL.

245
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,793
>> YEAH.

246
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,254
>> BECAUSE THERE'S SOME OTHER
INFORMATION.

247
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,463
>> WHAT OTHER INFORMATION?

248
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,467
>> I FEEL LIKE I DO HAVE A SHOT
WITH JESSICA AFTER OUR OUTING

249
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,635
TODAY.

250
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,970
SHE JUST SHOWED ME MORE OF
HERSELF, AND I KEPT LIKING IT.

251
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,432
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING I COULD
FIND WRONG WITH HER, HONESTLY.

252
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,726
SO I WAS DEFINING HER AS MY
DREAM GIRL, I GUESS.

253
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:13,315
SO I DECIDED I WANTED TO SHARE
WITH HER SOME INFORMATION.

254
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,651
SO JOE HAS THE IDOL.

255
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:20,656
WE FOUND IT TOGETHER.

256
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,490
RIGHT?

257
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,366
RIGHT?

258
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,663
>> I'M SO-- CAN I KISS YOU ON
THE CHEEK?

259
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,834
HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE THAT JOE
HAS THE IDOL BRINGS ME SO MUCH

260
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,501
HAPPINESS.

261
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,211
>> I'M GOING TO GO RINSE OFF.

262
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,755
>> YUP, YUP.

263
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,632
SECRETS ARE REALLY POWERFUL IN
THIS GAME.

264
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,511
IT'S "SURVIVOR," AND SO IT'S TO
MY BENEFIT THAT I KNOW JOE'S

265
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:42,887
SECRET.

266
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,972
THAT'S POWER.

267
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,934
SO UNRELATED, I MEAN, I GAVE HIM
A KISS ON THE CHEEK.

268
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:49,560
IT JUST HAPPENED.

269
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,770
MY KISSES ARE VERY PRIVATE.

270
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,191
LIKE, MY LIPS DON'T GO NEAR
OTHER PEOPLE'S CHEEKS VERY OFTEN

271
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,942
SO, THIS IS BIG!

272
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:15,211
>> YUP.

273
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,371
YOU DON'T REALLY SEARCH FOR THE
IDOL IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY

274
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,082
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD
RELATIONSHIP BUILDING, AND IT

275
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:58,879
MAKES PEOPLE PARINOID.

276
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,469
>> I DO KIND OF HAVE IDOL FEVER.

277
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,679
I WANT THE IDOL.

278
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,099
NOW, I MEAN, I'M NOT REALLY
HIDING LOOKING FOR AN IDOL AND,

279
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:14,395
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT WILL TURN
AROUND AND BITE ME, BUT BEING A

280
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,563
HUSTLER, WE'RE ALWAYS MOVING
ALONG-- PUN INTENDED.

281
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,148
I HAVE A MOVING COMPANY IN
ALABAMA AND THE MOVING INDUSTRY

282
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:22,236
IS IT NOT STOP-- WHEELS ALWAYS
ON THE GROUND, SOMETHING ALWAYS

283
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,445
IN MOTION.

284
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,990
THAT'S WHY THE WORK HARDER THAN
THE REST OF MY TRIBE MEMBERS,

285
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,950
LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

286
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,453
>> ME AND PATRICK HAVE A PRETTY
GOOD RELATIONSHIP, BUT HE

287
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,373
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A SOCIAL
GAME, AND I WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR

288
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,624
HIM.

289
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,295
SO I THINK THAT FOR MY GAME, I
NEED TO HELP PATRICK MESH BETTER

290
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,504
WITH THE GROUP.

291
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,300
YOU HAVE TO PLAY SMARTER, PAT,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU GOING IDOL

292
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,970
CRAZY, IS GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE
THINK LIKE, "WHY IS HE SO

293
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,138
WORRIED?"
YOU KNOW?

294
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,431
>> ALL RIGHT.

295
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,476
>> I'M JUST TELLING YOU BECAUSE,
LIKE, I DON'T WANT SOMETHING TO

296
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,686
HAPPEN.

297
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,480
>> SHE'S LOOKING OUT FOR MY BEST
INTEREST, AND I'M LOOKING OUT

298
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,732
FOR HERS AS WELL.

299
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,985
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT YOUR
NAME TO BE NEXT OR MY NAME TO BE

300
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,236
NEXT.

301
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,780
>> BUT ALI TELLING ME TO COOL IT
IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT TAKES

302
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,906
AWAY FROM MY PERSONALITY.

303
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,993
I MAY NOT BE ABE TO CREATE
RELATIONSHIPS IF I'M NOT BEING

304
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,535
ME.

305
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,121
>> DON'T DWELL ON IT.

306
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:14,663
IT'S OVER.

307
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,166
CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST.

308
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,126
LOOK FORWARD THE FUTURE PUP
LEARN, THOUGH, LEARN FROM IT.

309
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:25,507
>> I WILL, ALWAYS LEARN.

310
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,520
>> THANKS FOR COOKING, GUYS.

311
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,396
>> MY PLEASURE!

312
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,814
>> OH, MY GOD!

313
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,859
>> YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

314
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:44,985
>> NOT IF IT'S RAW.

315
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,195
THAT ONE'S COMPLETELY RAW.

316
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,029
SEE THE COLOR.

317
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,323
>> I JUST DON'T THINK WE CAN BE
PICKY.

318
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,201
>> I MEAN... IT'S NOT BEING
PICKY.

319
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,869
THIS IS (BLEEP) COMPLETELY RAW.

320
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:54,286
>> I'LL EAT IT.

321
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,706
I DON'T CARE.

322
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,957
>> YOU'LL EAT THE RAW ONES.

323
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:05,005
>> JOE HAD SOME ISSUE WITH THE
WAY WE COOKED THE PA-TA-TAS, NOT

324
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,217
WAIT HE WANTED THEM COOKED AT
EXPHOAM IF IT'S NOT TO HIS

325
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,595
LIKING HE CHUCKS IT IN THE WOODS
INSTEAD OF OFFERING IT TO

326
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,766
SOMEBODY ELSE TO EAT SO THAT CAN
BE A BIT OFF-PUTTING, WHEN FOOD

327
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,350
IS SCARCE.

328
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,434
>> I CAN'T EAT RAW FOOD.

329
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,310
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ALL DO IT.

330
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,940
>> JOE, YOU'RE WELCOME TO COOK
NEXT TIME.

331
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,901
>> JOE COMPLAINS A LOT SOMETIMES
AROUND CAMP.

332
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,111
SO HE'S ALREADY RUBBED SOME
PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY.

333
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,364
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, JOE HAS
THE IDOL.

334
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,742
AND THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT JOE
HAVING THE IDOL, THE MORE I

335
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,454
REALIZE THAT JOE HAS ALL THE
POWER, AND I DON'T LIKE THAT AT

336
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:37,913
ALL.

337
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,749
HERE'S ONE IDEA.

338
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,710
SO JOE DOES HAVE THE IDOL.

339
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:49,299
AND IF WE WERE TO LOSE TONIGHT,
LIKE, HE'D BE SUPER CONFIDENT

340
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,259
THAT MIKE WOULD GO HOME.

341
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,927
>> A BLINDSIDE?

342
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,886
I THOUGHT THAT LAST NIGHT.

343
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,013
>> SEND HIM HOME WITH THE IDOL
IN HIS POCKET.

344
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,640
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

345
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,227
>> THE IDOL IS UNPREDICTABLE,
ESPECIALLY IN AN UNPREDICTABLE

346
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,395
PERSON'S HANDS AND IT HAS A LOT
OF POWER.

347
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:05,274
AND I DON'T WANT THAT POWER
BEING THROWN AROUND WITHOUT MY

348
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,484
SAY IN IT.

349
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,111
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
REAL QUICK.

350
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,449
JOE HAS THE IDOL.

351
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,118
>YEAH.

352
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,035
>> OKAY.

353
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,913
>> COLE JUST WORD VOMITS THAT
JOE HAS IDOL.

354
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,417
AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

355
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,586
LIKE, IT'S TOO SOON.

356
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,963
I'M LIKE, WHY ARE YOU SHARING
THAT INFORMATION.

357
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,590
>> WE FOUND IT TOGETHER.

358
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:33,510
AND SO, WE COULD POTENTIALLY, IF
WE WANT TO GET RID OF THAT

359
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,264
THREAT, IF WE LOSE TONIGHT, WE
COULD SPLIT VOTES BETWEEN JOE

360
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,432
AND MIKE.

361
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:42,478
>> I THINK THAT HE NEEDED TO
WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

362
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,480
THE CHALLENGE AND TALK TO ME
AGAIN.

363
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,775
AND WE DECIDE IS IT WHAT WE WANT
TO DO.

364
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,567
>> COOL.

365
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,152
>> IF WE GET RID OF MIKE THIS
TIME.

366
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,320
>> YES.

367
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,991
>> AND THEN JOE'S STILL LEFT
WITH THE IDOL, WE CAN'T-- HE'S

368
00:17:56,074 --> 00:18:00,162
GOING TO BE A LOT MORE
SUSPICIOUS THAT HE MIGHT BE ON

369
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,330
THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

370
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,000
>> JOE IS AN AMAZING BLINDSIDE
CANDIDATE BECAUSE HE IS LOCKED

371
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,168
IN ON MIKE.

372
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:14,051
SO I AM FULL BUY-IN INTO THE JOE
BLINDSIDE ENJOY YOUR IDOL A

373
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,135
SUFNEAR PLAN.

374
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,180
>> WE'RE THINKING JOE OVER MIKE
TONIGHT POTENTIALLY.

375
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,140
HE'S NOT A STRONG SWIMMER.

376
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,393
HE WILL NOT BE SUPER GOOD AT
PUZZLES.

377
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,561
>> AND HE COMPLAINS A LOT.

378
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,898
>> RIGHT NOW WOULD BE THE BEST
TIME TO TAKE HIM OUT BECAUSE

379
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,358
MIKE KNOWS HE'S ON THE BOTTOM.

380
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,693
HE'S ALREADY TOLD ME THAT.

381
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,362
HE'LL GO WHEREVER I WANT HIM TO
GO.

382
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,990
>> I LIKE THE THOUGHT PROCESS,
COLE.

383
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,075
>> YEAH, YEAH.

384
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,285
>> I'M TICKED OFF AT COLE FOR
JUST RUNNING HIS MOUTH.

385
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,289
HE LOST A LOT OF POWER WITH ME
BY TELLING ROARK AND DESI, AND

386
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:49,044
THE LAST THING WE WANT IS FOR
JOE TO FIND OUT THAT WE KNOW

387
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,839
BECAUSE HE COULD PLAY HIS IDOL,
AND THEN ANY OF OUR HEADS WOULD

388
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,591
BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK,
PROBABLY COLE'S FIRST.

389
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,718
SO RIGHT NOW, HIM WANTING TO
BLINDSIDE JOE I AM NOT SURE IS

390
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:26,623

YOU'LL THEN USE SANDBAGS TO

403
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:11,501
YOU MUST THEN STACK THOSE BLOCKS
ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER.

>> PAT PARK.

513
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,872
>> Jeff: PATRICK STILL THE
ONLY PERSON TO THROW FOR THE

514
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,747
HUSTLERS.

515
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,207
>> IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH, YOU
CAN SWITCH.

516
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,208
>> Jeff: THERE IT IS!

517
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,376
GO, HUSTLERS!

518
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:25,088
GOT TO GATHER ALL YOUR BLOCKS
BEFORE YOU START STACKING.

519
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,715
>> I CAN'T GET IT UP.

520
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,716
>> HERE, TWO AT A TIME.

521
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,051
>> I NEED TO BE HIGHER.

522
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,388
>> Jeff: THIS IS REMINISCENT
OF THE FIRST CHALLENGE WHEN YOU

523
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,682
HAD TO STAND ON EACH OTHERS'
SHOULDERS.

524
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,309
>> HOLD MY LEG!

525
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,227
>> HEALERS DOING A NICE JOB.

526
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,270
HEALERS WORKING VERY QUICKLY.

527
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,565
>> HOLD MY LEGS!

528
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,775
>> Jeff: HUSTLERS STILL RACING
TO CATCH UP.

529
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,696
CHRISSY IS UP ON THE SHOULDERS
OF THE HEROES.

530
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,198
JESSICA UP ON THE SHOULDERS OF
THE HEALERS.

531
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,782
>> THIS IS THE LAST ONE!

532
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,742
WE'RE WINNING.

533
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,161
>> Jeff: HEALERS HAVE NOT LOST
A CHALLENGE YET.

534
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,413
THEY THINK THEY HAVE IT!

535
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,873
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT, NO.

536
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:00,790
>> WHAT'S NOT RIGHT?

537
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,835
>> ARE WE MISSING A BLOCK?

538
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,713
>> Jeff: THIS OPENS THE DOOR
FOR THE HUSTLERS AND THE HEROES.

539
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,883
>> WHAT'S NOT--
>> BLOCK, BLOCK, BLOCK.

540
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,926
>> OH, MY GOD!

541
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,137
>> Jeff: THE HEALERS DID NOT
HAVE ALL THEIR BLOCKS!

542
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,013
HUGE MISTAKE BY THE HEALERS.

543
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:15,805
>> GET DOWN!

544
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:20,435
>> JOE, GIVE IT TO ME!

545
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:20,936
>> Jeff: HEROES GOT IT!

546
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:25,398
GET BACK TO YOUR MAT.

547
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:30,946
3, 2, 1, HEROES WIN IMMUNITY AND
REWARD!

548
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,240
JESSICA NOW BACK UP FOR THE
HEALERS.

549
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,783
HUSTLERS STRUGGLING TO GET RYAN
UP.

550
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,244
>> LET ME DOWN!

551
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,453
JUST DROP ME!

552
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,746
>> IT'S OKAY.

553
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,081
IT'S OKAY.

554
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:45,168
>> Jeff: HEALERS WIN IMMUNITY
AND REWARD, SENDING THE HUSTLER

555
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:49,798
TRIBE TO TRIBAL COUNCIL AGAIN.

556
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,466
>> GOOD JOB.

557
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,802
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT WAS SO
AWESOME!

558
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,097
>> Jeff: HERE ORGANIZATION
CONGRATULATIONS.

559
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,681
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

560
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,640
NOBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

561
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,100
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

562
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,852
>> Jeff: HEALERS, ONCE AGAIN,
SAFE FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL.

563
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:08,650
NOBODY GOING HOME.

564
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,986
HERO TRIBE, THANKS TO THE
MISTAKE BY THE HEALERS, NICE

565
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,778
REWARD FOR YOU.

566
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,488
COME GRAB YOUR CHICKENS.

567
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,489
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

568
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:18,118
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

569
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,328
HEALERS, FORTUNATELY, YOU STILL
HAVE THE EGGS.

570
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,162
COME GRAB THEM.

571
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,332
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

572
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:30,213
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

573
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,464
PATRICK, WHAT'S THE FEELING?

574
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,843
WE'RE ONLY EIGHT DAYS IN, AND,
YET, YOU'RE GOING BACK TO

575
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,470
TRIBAL, GOG LOSE ANOTHER TRIBE
MEMBER.

576
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,722
YOU'RE ALREADY DOWN TO FIVE.

577
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,641
IS IT GOING TO BE A BIT OF A
MADHOUSE?

578
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,809
>> YES, JEFF.

579
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:46,021
WE ALL LIKE EACH OTHER AND WE
ALL GET ALONG WELL, AND IT'S

580
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,814
QUITE DEPRESSING KNOWING THAT
WE'RE GOING BACK.

581
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,525
>> BUT WE'RE GOING, AND WE GOTTA
DO IT.

582
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,320
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GRAB
YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

583
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,823
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL, WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE THIRD

584
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,366
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

585
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,328
>> WE JUST LOST THE CHALLENGE,
BUT PATRICK DIDN'T WANT TO STOP.

586
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,996
IT WAS LIKE A ONE-MAN SHOW.

587
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,040
I'VE BEEN PLAYING CENTER FIELD
FOR 25 YEARS.

588
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,208
I CAN HIT A CATCHER IN THE
FOREHEAD.

589
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,754
AND I THINK EVERYBODY'S PRETTY
MUCH OVER PATRICK IN THE WAY

590
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,340
THIS HE COST US TODAY, AND I
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PATRICK

591
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,425
IS GOING HOME.

592
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,336
HITTING ALL THE TARGETS LIKE I
SHOULD HAVE BEEN, AND I SHOULD

593
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:56,424
HAVE LET SOMEBODY, POSSIBLY, SUB
IN FOR ME.

594
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,425
SORRY.

595
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,928
>> YOU JAENT JUSTIFY IT, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

596
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,931
>> I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

597
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,682
LAUREN'S NOT HAPPY WITH ME.

598
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,143
BUT BY LOOKING AT HER, I DON'T
THINK THAT HER COMING IN FOR ME

599
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,898
WOULD HAVE REALLY CHANGED MUCH.

600
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:12,941
I'M SORRY, GUYS.

601
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,942
>> DON'T BE SORRY.

602
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:14,943
>> YEAH.

603
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:15,777
WE'RE ALL GOOD.

604
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,905
>> I KNOW YOU TRIED YOUR
HARDEST, MAN.

605
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:19,531
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

606
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,909
>> THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

607
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:28,832
>> I'M GONNA RINSE OFF.

608
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,585
>> WELL, GUYS, WHAT'S--
>> WE'RE GOOD.

609
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,837
SHE WANTS YOU OUT.

610
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,963
WE'RE GETTING HER OUT.

611
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,632
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

612
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,300
>> I MEAN, SHE HAS SAID HIM?

613
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,261
>> I THINK SHE ASSUMES.

614
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,345
>> THAT'S GREAT.

615
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,139
>> WHY IS IT GREAT?

616
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,641
>> I'M BEING VERY SARCASTIC.

617
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:47,559
>> DON'T EVEN WORRY.

618
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,936
>> SO TONIGHT, I'VE GOT THE GUYS
ON MY SIDE.

619
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,148
I'VE GOT ALI ON MY SIDE, AND I'M
COMFORTABLE KNOWING LAUREN'S

620
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,274
GOING HOME.

621
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,943
BUT I DON'T WANT HER GOING
AROUND WORRYING, SO I'M TRYING

622
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:03,158
TO, YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE I
CONTINUE TO HAVE HER PART OF MY

623
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,994
CONVERSATION AND, YOU KNOW,
MAKING HER ENJOY HERSELF HERE.

624
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:06,828
YOU GOOD?

625
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:11,374
>> I'M AS GOOD AS I CAN GET, I
GUESS.

626
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,668
HOW ABOUT YOU?

627
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,003
>> I FEEL TERRIBLE.

628
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,838
>> FEEL TERRIBLE?

629
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,175
>> YEAH.

630
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,176
FREAKING COULDN'T KNOCK ANY OF
THOSE FREAKING BLOCKS DOWN.

631
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,846
>> WELL, WE KEPT SAYING WE'D
SWITCH OUT WITH YOU.

632
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,974
WE KEPT SAYING, WE COULD TELL
YOU WERE TIRED, AND I PLAYED

633
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,186
OUTFIELD FOR 25 YEARS.

634
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,022
ME AND ALI KEPT SAYING THAT.

635
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,899
BUT YOU ACTED LIKE WE WEREN'T
EVEN THERE.

636
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,026
IT WAS LIKE A ONE-MAN TEAM THERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

637
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,029
TO LOSE TODAY IT, JUST IN
GENERAL, I'M BUMMED OUT ABOUT

638
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,698
IT, BUT PATRICK WOULDN'T QUIT.

639
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,074
AND IT REALLY DID COST US.

640
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:49,704
I WOULD MUCH RATHER LOSE AS A
TEAM THAN ONE PERSON LOSE FOR

641
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:50,872
EVERYBODY.

642
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,582
I'M ASSUMING YOU ALL ARE GOING
TO TRY TO VOTE ME OUT TONIGHT.

643
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,418
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S RIGHT.

644
00:29:55,502 --> 00:30:00,256
>> IF IT'S NOT ME, WHO ELSE IS
IS IT IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE

645
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,382
IN MIND?

646
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,344
BECAUSE I CAN LOOK AT YOU AND
TELL YOU HAVE ME IN MIND.

647
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,304
>> YEAH, BUT--
>> YEAH BUT WHAT?

648
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,222
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

649
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,015
>> REDHEADS DON'T DO VERY WELL
AT LYING.

650
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:14,062
SO YOU COSTING US THE WIN COST
VOTE MEEG OUT TODAY.

651
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,856
THAT MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.

652
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,944
ALL HE COULD DO IS GRIN, SO I
KNOW FOR A FACT THAT PATRICK

653
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,195
WILL WRITE MY NAME DOWN.

654
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,949
YOU KNOW, TO BE A GOOD FISHERMAN
DO I SIT HERE IN THE SAME SPOT

655
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,410
EVERY DAY AND WAIT FOR THE FISH
TO COME BY?

656
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,578
NO.

657
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,789
I TRY NUMEROUS DIFFERENT THINGS
AND I NEVER THREW MY HANDSUT

658
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,166
WITHOUT TRYING MY HARDEST.

659
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,586
>> WHAT UPSET ME AT THE END IS
THE WAY HE WAS GRINNING AT ME,

660
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,754
LIKE IT WAS FUNNY.

661
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:43,716
>> IF HE HAD-- HE WOULD HAVE
REALIZED, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

662
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,425
MORE ON THE TEAM THAN HIM.

663
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,510
>> EXACTLY.

664
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,177
>> IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A
PATRICK LOSS, IT WOULD HAVE

665
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,929
BEEN, "AT LEAST WE ALL TRIED."

666
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,266
PATRICK BEING THE COMPETITIVE
PERSON THAT HE IS, HE WAS

667
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,434
SUPPOSED TO BE ONE STRONG IN
CHALLENGES.

668
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,271
BUT AGAIN, WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO
IT, WE DIDN'T WIN.

669
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,107
AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE A
REPETITION FOR US.

670
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,069
SO I NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF
PATRICK BEING AROUND IS REALLY

671
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,153
AN ADVANTAGE ANYMORE.

672
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,115
>> I MEAN, DON'T TAKE THIS
OFFENSIVELY, BUT YOU'RE THE

673
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:07,532
ODDBALL.

674
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,116
>> YEAH, YEAH.

675
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:08,992
>> AND I'M THE OLD WOMAN.

676
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,120
>> NOW THAT SIMONE IS GONE--
>> EXACTLY.

677
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,957
>> AND I TRUST ALI AND I TRUST
DEVON BUT I DON'T TRUST--

678
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,166
>> PAT, YEAH.

679
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,130
>> HE'S A WILD CARD.

680
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:26,843
>> LAUREN JUST CAME UP TO ME AND
SHE'S JUST LIKE, "IT'S GOING TO

681
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:27,760
BE PATRICK."

682
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,928
>> OKAY.

683
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,599
>> SHE'S LIKE, "YOU'RE THE
ODDBALL, AND, LIKE, I'M THE OLD

684
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,516
LADY, SO... I WAS LIKE UH...

685
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,145
>> WHAT MATTERS IS WE HAVE--
>> FU FOR SURE.

686
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,396
>> EVERYBODY COMING TO US.

687
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:43,526
>> DEVON AND I ARE IN POSITION
WHERE WE CAN SORT OF DICTATE THE

688
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,611
VOTE.

689
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,154
THE OPTIONS NOW ARE VOTE OFF
LAUREN OR VOTE OFF PAT.

690
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:51,326
>> WHAT DO YOU JOONG THIS IS
UNEQUIVOCALLY A BIG DECISION FOR

691
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,201
ME.

692
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,162
AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO
DO YET.

693
00:31:54,245 --> 00:32:00,126
>> PAT'S JUST--
>> I WANT TO SAVE PAT.

694
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,836
WE GET RID OF LAUREN TONIGHT.

695
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,839
AND WE CAN DO THE BOYS TO THE
MERGE.

696
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:05,506
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

697
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,716
PAT AND LAUREN HATE EACH OTHER.

698
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,180
>> YEAH, BUT I'D RATHER-- I
THINK I'D RATHER GO TO THE MERGE

699
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,139
WITH LAUREN THAN WITH PAT.

700
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,141
>> WE DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL GET TO
THE MERGE.

701
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,976
I'M GOING BACK AND FORTH.

702
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,562
>> PAT STEPPED UP AT THE
CHALLENGE, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING

703
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:24,025
TO STEP UP, YOU BETTER BE ABLE
TO HANDLE WHAT YOU STEP UP FOR.

704
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,568
IT WAS JUST PAT CHOKING.

705
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,488
AND I DO THINK WE LOST BECAUSE
OF THAT.

706
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,031
LAUREN, ON THE OTHER HAND, SHE'S
VERY STEADY.

707
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,367
I TRUST HER.

708
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,203
BUT, SHE DOESN'T REALLY FIT IN
WITH THE OTHER TRIBE MEMBERS,

709
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:40,917
AND IF WE KEEP LAUREN AROUND,
WE'RE MORE LIKELY TO LOSE THE

710
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,253
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, AND
WE'VE ALREADY LOST TWO IN A ROW.

711
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,383
>> I COULD BE A HOT HEAD, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME, I KNOW WHEN TO

712
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,551
TURN IT INTO I KNOW WHEN IT TO
TURN IT OFF.

713
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,222
I FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE EVERYTHING
I CAN DO.

714
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,226
OBVIOUSLY, I'M A HUSTLER FOR A
REASON.

715
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,188
SO IF IT IS ME GOING HOME
TONIGHT, I WILL PROMISE YOU, I'M

716
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:12,240
NOT GOING TO GO HOME WITHOUT A
FIGHT.

717
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:24,377
NOT GOING TO GO HOME WITHOUT A
FIGHT.

718
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,378
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO LAUREN,
EIGHT DAYS IN.

719
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,256
YOU'VE LOST TWO OUT OF THREE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.

720
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,552
AT WHAT POINT DO YOU GUYS STOP
TALKING ABOUT HOW WELL YOU GET

721
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,722
ALONG AND START OWNING THE FACT
THAT IT JUST ISN'T WORKING RIGHT

722
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,098
NOW WITH THIS GROUP?

723
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,182
>> TODAY.

724
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,310
I MEAN, THAT CHALLENGE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN A WIN FOR US.

725
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,772
BUT ONE OF US KIND OF TOOK IT TO
THEIR OWN LEVEL AND TRIED TO

726
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,315
COMPLETE IT BY THEMSELVES.

727
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,402
>> Jeff: PATRICK, SHE CAN ONLY
BE TALKING ABOUT YOU AND THE

728
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:49,861
SANDBAGS, RIGHT?

729
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:50,945
>> YES, SIR, I AM.

730
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,822
>> DEFINITELY TALKING ABOUT ME,
JEFF.

731
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,951
I CAN SEE WHERE SHE'S CONCERNED
WITH ME NOT WINNING THAT, AND

732
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,328
THERE IS A POINT WHERE IT COULD
BE MY FAULT.

733
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,248
I SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THE
ENTIRE TIME FOR MYSELF.

734
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,499
>> I AGREE.

735
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,251
I MEAN I WAS GOING TO FINISH THE
SENTENCE, BUT HE FINISHED IT FOR

736
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,210
ME.

737
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,295
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TOOK THE WHOLE
TIME HIMSELF.

738
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,424
I MEAN, I PLAYED OUTFIELD,
CENTER FIELD FOR PROBABLY 25

739
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,633
YEARS.

740
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,051
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT IT'S
NOT A ONE-MAN SHOW SOMETIMES.

741
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,430
WE HAVE TO LOSE TOGETHER AND WE
NEED TO WIN TOGETHER.

742
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,891
AND TODAY, WE DIDN'T LOSE
TOGETHER.

743
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,142
>> IT'S AN ADRENALINE RUSH.

744
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,936
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT, SON, BUT
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WENT UP THERE,

745
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,605
THERE WAS FIVE OF US.

746
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,316
AND THEN THERE WASN'T
MYSTERIOUSLY JUST ONE PERSON

747
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:28,816
LEFT.

748
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,400
WE DIDN'T DISAPPEAR.

749
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,611
>> I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

750
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,279
>> Jeff: ALI WHAT WAS YOUR
TAKE ON THE CHALLENGE?

751
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:38,493
>> PATRICK DID CALL AN EXECUTIVE
DECISION AND SAY, "I'M STAYING

752
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,660
IN."

753
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,161
YON IF THAT SHOULD HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING ABOUT US BEING

754
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,412
HERE.

755
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,957
WHO KNOWS IF WE HAD SWITCHED WE
COULD HAVE TOOKEN EVEN LONGER?

756
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,293
FOR ME I DON'T LIKE TO DWELL ON
THINGS FROM THE PAST AND WE NEED

757
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,377
TO LOOK FURTHER FROM HERE.

758
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:52,006
>> Jeff: PATRICK, DOES THAT
GIVE YOU A LITTLE SENSE OF

759
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:55,843
COMFORT THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
BE JUDGED ON ONE ELEMENT FOR ONE

760
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,219
CHALLENGE?

761
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,428
>> FOR SURE.

762
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,472
JEFF, I TRIED MY BEST, AND IT
DEFINITELY GIVES ME A SENSE OF

763
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,517
COMFORT IN KNOWING I'M NOT GOING
TO BE HELD TOTALLY ACCOUNTABLE.

764
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,018
I WANTED THOSE CHICKENS.

765
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:04,936
THEY LOOKED SO GOOD.

766
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,312
>> Jeff: LAUREN, YOU HAD YOUR
HAND RAISED.

767
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,398
>> LIKE I SAID, WE STILL HAVE TO
PLAY AS A TEAM, AND TODAY JUST

768
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,610
SHOWED THAT PATRICK IS NOT
EXACTLY A TEAM PLAYER.

769
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,487
I MEAN, HE'S A GOOD IDOL HUNTER.

770
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,279
THAT'S ALL HE DOES.

771
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,364
EY ADMITTED, "I'M CONSTANTLY
LOOKING.

772
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,532
I'M CONSTANTLY LOOKING."

773
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,285
IT KEEPS YOU ON EDGE KNOWING
THAT SOMEONE IS TRYING TO PLAY

774
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,372
STRATEGY AND WORRIED MUS ENOUGH
THEY NEED TO COVER THEIR BACK.

775
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,709
I DON'T THINK I'VE LOOKED FOR
THE IDOL YET, BUT IF HE'S

776
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,087
HUNTING, MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL GO
HUNTING.

777
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,380
>> Jeff: PATRICK, YOU HAD A
BIG REACTION TO LAUREN SAYING

778
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,715
SHE HASN'T LOOKED YET.

779
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,886
>> I'M WORRIED THAT LAUREN HAS
AN IDOL, AND HER SAYING SHE

780
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,346
HASN'T LOOKED WAS A BIG RELIEF.

781
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:44,392
>> I HAVE TWO OF THEM.

782
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:49,397
>> I HAD A QUICK CONVERSATION
WITH LAUREN AND SAID, "WHO ARE

783
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,691
AND AND I DIDN'T GIVE HER AN
ANSWER.

784
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,942
>> LET'S SAY WHAT YOU REALLY
SAID.

785
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:57,697
YOU APPROACHED ME WITH A SMILE
WHICH IS VERY OBVIOUS AND I

786
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,407
SAID, "OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE VOTING
FOR ME TONIGHT."

787
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,410
AND HE SAT THERE AND GRINNED AND
I SAID YOU'RE TRYING TO COMFORT

788
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:07,415
ME WHEN I NEVER BELIEVED A
REDHEAD A DAY IN MY LIFE.

789
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,752
JEFF, I WILL SAY, TONIGHT, ONE
OF US IS GOING TO BE BLINDSIDED.

790
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,879
I CAN SAY THAT.

791
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,423
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, SOMEBODY WILL
BE BLINDSIDED FOR SURE.

792
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:20,261
>> Jeff: RYAN, IT'S KIND OF
LIKE YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP--

793
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,430
>> I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A
RELATIONSHIP.

794
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,431
>> Jeff: OKAY.

795
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,391
>> YOU KNOW SOMEBODY?

796
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,559
( LAUGHTER ).

797
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,518
>> Jeff: WELL, I WAS JUST
GOING TO SAY, IT'S KIND OF LIKE

798
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,772
IF YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP AND
GUTO THERAPY.

799
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,609
THE FIRST THING THE THERAPIST
WILL SAY IS LET'S JUST TALK.

800
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,610
>> YEAH.

801
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,819
>> Jeff: GET IT OUT, AND
THINGS WILL GET BETTER.

802
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,321
CAN YOU FEEL THAT, THE TRIBE IS
AIRING TO GET MOVEMENT GOING?

803
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:42,575
>> I DO FEEL THAT WAY BECAUSE I
THINK EVERY MEMBER OF THE GROUP

804
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,410
IS THINKING YEAH, THIS IS A
HAPPY GROUP AND I'M CONTRIBUTING

805
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,454
TO THAT HAPPY GROUP.

806
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,499
BUT IT'S NOT A HAPPY GROUP, AND
WE'RE NOT A SUCCESSFUL GROUP AT

807
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,626
THAT.

808
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,461
SO SOMEBODY IS INFLUENCING THE
GROUP IN A NEGATIVE WAY.

809
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,548
>> Jeff: DEVON, IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM OF THIS

810
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,467
GROUP IS JUST CHEMISTRY?

811
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,676
>> YEAH.

812
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,806
MY VOTE TONIGHT IS, YOU KNOW,
HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION, WHAT

813
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,476
IS GOING TO GET THAT CHEMISTRY
GOING AGAIN, SO THAT WE CAN WIN

814
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,646
>> I THINK MY VOTE IS GOING TO
BE FOR THE SAME REASON.

815
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,438
>> Jeff: CHEMISTRY.

816
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,649
>> CHEMISTRY, TO KEEP US
ROLLING.

817
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,275
IT AIN'T NECESSARILY WHAT WAS
DONE.

818
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,486
IT'S HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER.

819
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:23,240
>> BUT, ALSO, FOR WHENEVER THE
MERGE COMES, WE NEED TO BE BEST

820
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:27,536
SUITED GOING FORWARD TO SOCIALLY
DISCERN WHICH GROUP CAN WE FIT

821
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,746
INTO.

822
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,165
BECAUSE STRATEGICALLY, WHAT THE
HECK ARE WE GOING TO PRESENT

823
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,333
STROOJICALLY TO THEM?

824
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,000
ARE WE GOING TO SHOW THEM HOW TO
DO CHALLENGES AFTER THAT?

825
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,168
THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

826
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:37,338
>> Jeff: PATRICK, DO YOU FEEL
THAT PRESSURE, TOO, THAT IF

827
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,132
THERE'S A MERGE COMING, MAN,
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

828
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,342
>> FOR SURE.

829
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,553
WE'RE ALREADY FEWER NUMBERS THAN
THE OTHER TRIBES SO HOW CAN WE

830
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,263
WORK TOGETHER TO GAIN NUMBERS?

831
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,014
WHO CAN TALK THE BEST?

832
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,684
WHO CAN MAKE FRIENDS THE
EASIEST?

833
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,394
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING I
CAN OFFER.

834
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:56,524
I CAN MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LOVED AND
COMFORTED AND THAT'S PART OF

835
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,692
MAKING FRIENDS AND GETTING AN
ALLIANCE.

836
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,402
>> Jeff: ALI, THAT'S A REALLY
HONEST STATEMENT FROM PATRICK.

837
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,654
>> I GUESS THAT'S HIS OPINION.

838
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:05,116
HE MAY THINK HE GETS ALONG WITH
PEOPLE BUT WHY CAN'T YOU GET

839
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,994
ALONG WITH LAUREN AND WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR EIGHT DAYS.

840
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,163
HOW EASY IS IT GOING TO BE FOR
HIM WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLICKED

841
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,499
EIGHT, 10, 15 DAYS AND WE HAVE
TO TRY TO SQUEEZE OURSELVES IN

842
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,543
THERE.

843
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,545
>> Jeff: PATRICK, YOU HAVE A
SMILE ON YOUR FACE.

844
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,881
IS THAT BECAUSE SOMETHING IS
HAPPENING FOR THIS TRIBE, EVEN

845
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,552
THOUGH WE'RE AT THE WORST PLACE
YOU CAN BE, TRIBAL COUNCIL?

846
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,222
>> YOU KNOW, JEFF, I ALWAYS
WELCOME CRITICISM BECAUSE, YOU

847
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,849
KNOW, I'M NOT A PERFECT PERSON.

848
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:34,603
I KNOW I HAVE-- I HAVE
DIFFICULTIES IN-- IN GROWING,

849
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,771
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

850
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,565
HEARING ALI TELL ME THAT I'M NOT
NECESSARILY A GOOD SOCIAL

851
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,774
PLAYER.

852
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,277
AND HEARING LAUREN TELL ME THAT
I'M NOT LISTENING TO THE TEAM

853
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,696
WHILE WE'RE GOING THROUGH
CHALLENGES, YOU KNOW, IT IS A

854
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,905
WAKE-UP CALL TO ME.

855
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:49,076
>> Jeff: SO, PATRICK, YOU JUST
TOOK TWO LETHAL CRITICISMS FROM

856
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,579
TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND YOU'RE
SAYING, "I WELCOME IT.

857
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:51,912
I'M LEARNING."

858
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,414
>> RIGHT.

859
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,584
AND, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GROW
FROM ALL THIS.

860
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,087
>> Jeff: RYAN, IS IT TOO BIG
OF A STRETCH TO SAY THAT MOMENTS

861
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,550
LIKE THAT BETWEEN ALI AND LAWREN
AND PATRICK CAN ACTUALLY FLIP A

862
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,676
TRIBE?

863
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,138
>> YOU KNOW, TRIBAL COUNCIL IS--
IS VERY-- IT HAS SO MUCH

864
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,431
MOMENTUM, RIGHT?

865
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,308
AND YOU CAN GAIN SO MUCH BECAUSE
YOU JUST COME TOGETHER AND SAY,

866
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,517
"THIS IS THE GROUP.

867
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,104
THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT WE'RE
GOING TO SHINE UP THIS CRAPPY

868
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,606
LITTLE TRICYCLE AND TRY TO SELL
IT TO THESE OTHER TRIBES WHO

869
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,649
NOW, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE USED
AS PAWNS.

870
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,110
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SAYING AT
ALL.

871
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,948
WE ALSO UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOT
COMINCOMING IN AS THE C.E.O.s.

872
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,616
WE MAY BE MONTH THE FLOORS AT
FIRST.

873
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,617
>> WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HUSTLERS.

874
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,452
>> EXACTLY.

875
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,286
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

876
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,537
NOBODY HERE IS GIVING UP.

877
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,290
AND WE ARE THE ONLY TRIBE THAT
IS GOING TO HAVE REAL UNITY AND

878
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:42,630
THAT IS SOMETHING UNIQUE ABOUT
US AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT.

879
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,591
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.

880
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:51,722
LAUREN, YOU'RE UP.

881
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,607
YOU'RE AGGRAVATING!

882
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,362
>> I'M SORRY, LAUREN.

883
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,573
YOU HAD TO GO.

884
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:35,057
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

885
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,519
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

886
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:43,107
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

887
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,902
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

888
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,697
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL

889
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,197
IMMEDIATELY.

890
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,492
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

891
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:58,706
FIRST VOTE, PATRICK.

892
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,456
LAUREN.

893
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:05,880
ONE VOTE PATRICK, ONE VOTE
LAUREN.

894
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:06,755
PATRICK.

895
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,426
THAT'S TWO VOTES PATRICK, ONE
VOTE LAUREN.

896
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,012
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR," PATRICK.

897
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:13,387
THAT'S THREE.

898
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,096
THAT'S ENOUGH.

899
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:20,853
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

900
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:24,732
>> OH!

901
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:30,905
YOU GUY GUYS ARE AWFUL.

902
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:40,998
>> Jeff: PATRICK, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

903
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:47,254
>> Jeff: PATRICK, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

904
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,716
>> Jeff: WELL, TRIBAL IS THE
END FOR SOMEBODY BUT TONIGHT, IT

905
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,428
ALSO APPEARS TO BE A REBIRTH FOR
THE REST OF THE TRIBE.

906
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:57,097
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

907
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,142
GOOD NIGHT.

908
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,608
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

909

>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

910
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,529
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

911
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,120
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR": JUST WHEN YOU THINK

912
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,121
YOU'RE ON TOP--
>> THINGS WERE WELL OILED AND

913
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:21,497
GREASED.

914
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,289
WE ARE MOVING.

915
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,624
>> Jeff: THE GAME FLIPS UPSIDE
DOWN.

916
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,626
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR BUFFS.

917
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,835
>> WHOA!

918
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,629
>> Jeff: WE ARE SWITCHING
TRIBES.

919
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,755
>> MY PALMS ARE SWEATING.

920
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,673
MY HEART WAS RACING.

921
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,757
>> OH!

922
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,803
>> EVERYTHING GETS ERASED AND
IT'S A BRAND-NEW GAME.

923
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,720
>> WILD.

924
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,473
>> THIS IS THE WORST THING I'VE
EVER FELT.

925
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,308
I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS COMING.

926
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,602
I IT TOTAL TRUST WITH RYAN,
DEVON, AND ALI.

927
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:47,648
I HOPE YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE A
VERY SUCCESSFUL GAME BECAUSE

928
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,485
YOU'RE LIARS AND IT REALLY HURTS
ME THAT YOU WOULD NOT KEEP YOUR

929
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,653
WORD.

930
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,989
IT'S TOO EARLY IN THE GAME FOR
ME TO LEAVE AND THIS HAS BEEN

931
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:55,406
DEVASTATING.
