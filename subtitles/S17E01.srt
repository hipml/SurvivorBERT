they do, if that is what they

192
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:25,468
do.

193
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,344
(chuckles)

194
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,513
Rock, paper, scissor to see

195
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,806
who chooses first.

196
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,391
>> Okay, ready, one, two, three?

197
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,184
Got her.

198
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,060
>> PROBST: Paper covers rock.

199
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,019
Bob will choose first.

200
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,896
And how it will work is you will

201
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,356
make the first choice, then you

202
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:38,689
will choose.

203
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,233
Then the person who was chosen

204
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,442
will make the next choice.

205
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,069
These are individual decisions.

206
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:43,611
All right, Bob, your first

207
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,114
choice of who you want on your

208
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:46,906
tribe.

209
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,658
>> I'm bad at names.

210
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,576
Can I take Baldy?

211
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,035
(laughter)

212
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,203
>> PROBST: The guy with shaved

213
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:52,411
head.

214
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,913
You want to tell him your name?

215
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,789
>> Thanks, Bob. It's Ace.

216
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,456
>> Nice to be able to talk to

217
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,541
you.

218
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,126
>> I'm going to talk to you

219
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:58,334
today.

220
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,544
>> The woman that was standing

221
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,920
next to Ace.

222
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,171
>> My name is Crystal.

223
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,218
>> Hey, Crystal. Come on over.

224
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:07,844
>> Ace, it's now your choice.

225
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,929
>> I don't think it would be

226
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:10,763
appropriate for a photographer

227
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,806
not to have a model.

228
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,140
Sugar, please.

229
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:12,890
>> Yes.

230
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,434
(contestants chuckle)

231
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:15,726
>> Awesome.

232
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,062
>> PROBST: Sugar joins Ace and

233
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,107
Bob.

234
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,025
Crystal, your choice.

235
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,069
>> Suzanne, come on home.

236
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,112
>> I knew it.

237
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,239
>> You know, mamas gotta hang

238
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:28,531
together.

239
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,699
>> That's right. (both laugh)

240
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,533
>> Okay, now we're playing

241
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,326
<i>Stupid Survivor</i> because this

242
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:32,869
makes zero sense.

243
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,162
Like, she clearly is not an

244
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,164
athletic person.

245
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,165
I'm so confused.

246
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,457
Like, don't you want to win

247
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,459
immunity?

248
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,127
>> PROBST: All right,

249
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,961
interesting so far.

250
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:42,253
>> Go, moms.

251
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:46,591
>> Uh, the tall farmer-looking

252
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,508
boy.

253
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,176
(laughter)

254
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,260
>> Hey, I'm Marcus.

255
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,012
>> Marcus, welcome aboard.

256
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,430
>> I'm going to go for the

257
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:52,763
surfer dude.

258
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,598
He looks beefy strong.

259
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,057
>> Matty.

260
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,391
>> Hey, Matty.

261
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,059
>> Come on down, Matty!

262
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,643
>> We need some strength, Ace.

263
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,687
>> PROBST: What do you think,

264
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,062
Matty?

265
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,397
You like this tribe?

266
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,814
>> Yeah. (all laugh)

267
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,733
>> Like he has a choice.

268
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,734
>> I got three moms.

269
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,401
>> That's right.

270
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,277
>> PROBST: All right, Marcus,

271
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,652
your choice.

272
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,029
>> I'll take the guy in the

273
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:08,404
suit.

274
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,616
>> I'm Charlie.

275
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,367
>> PROBST: Charlie's happy.

276
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,410
>> Hi!

277
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,912
>> I'm gonna go with the guy

278
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,954
in the flowered shirt.

279
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:17,872
>> Randy.

280
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,625
>> PROBST: Randy.

281
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,627
>> Palomo.

282
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,252
>><i> Paloma.</i>

283
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,754
>> Paloma. Come on down.

284
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,339
>> That's cool.

285
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,174
>> We gotta have a tie on our

286
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,425
team. Come on.

287
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,636
Dan, Dan. Nice to meet you.

288
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,054
>> My lady, Kelly.

289
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:33,679
>> Yay!

290
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,598
>> I'm taking the young Jay-Z

291
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,724
there on the end.

292
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,184
>> Hey, my name is Danny,

293
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,852
by the way, but you can call me

294
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,645
G-Sizzle or GC.

295
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,729
>> I'm gonna take the other

296
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,104
blond.

297
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,482
I think we need three blonds.

298
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,691
>> PROBST: Three people left.

299
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,692
GC, it's your choice.

300
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,986
>> I'm gonna pick the big homey

301
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,363
with all the game right there.

302
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:50,863
I don't know your name.

303
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,781
>> Oh, my name is Ken.

304
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,116
>> Ken, my bad. All right, Ken.

305
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,160
>> Come on over, Ken.

306
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,621
>> PROBST: Two choices left.

307
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,206
Jacquie, who do you want on

308
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:00,498
your tribe?

309
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,208
>> The girl in the suit.

310
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:02,750
>> Corinne.

311
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,543
>> PROBST: Corinne joins the

312
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,878
yellow tribe.

313
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,047
>> Welcome, Corinne.

314
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,881
>> PROBST: Gotta ask you,

315
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,925
Michelle, last one chosen.

316
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:11,342
>> Yeah.

317
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:11,926
>> PROBST: What does it feel

318
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:12,802
like?

319
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,220
>> I'll learn to love you guys,

320
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:14,720
maybe.

321
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,806
>> We'll take another hot girl

322
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,598
over here. That's fine.

323
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,225
>> Yeah!

324
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,685
>> Yeah! Yeah!

325
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:20,977
>> Finally!

326
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,980
>> PROBST: All right, we have

327
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,231
our two tribes.

328
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,192
Red tribe, you are Fang.

329
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,654
Here are your buffs.

330
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:37,201
Yellow, you are Kota.

331
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,119
>> Kota!

332
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,078
>> PROBST: All right, guys,

333
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,371
ready to get to your first

334
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,748
challenge?

335
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,583
On my go, you're going to race

336
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,918
through the flags to the top

337
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:46,627
of the hill, where you will find

338
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,755
two individual immunity idols,

339
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,341
one for each tribe.

340
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,467
The first person from

341
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,386
each tribe to get to the top of

342
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,762
the hill and grab the idol will

343
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,181
be safe at the first Tribal

344
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,099
Council.

345
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:00,850
Also waiting for you at the top

346
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,185
of the hill are the essentials

347
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,146
that you're gonna start with,

348
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,272
including a bag of rice.

349
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,065
There is one more twist to this

350
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:08,816
challenge.

351
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,444
Also waiting at the top of the

352
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,738
hill is an extra bag of corn

353
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,406
and beans.

354
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,533
The first entire tribe to get

355
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,827
all of their members across the

356
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,662
black line wins the corn and

357
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,456
beans.

358
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,915
Do you race out ahead selfishly

359
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,834
and get that idol for yourself

360
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,045
or do you work together, thus

361
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,047
ensuring food?

362
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,506
I'll see you at the top.

363
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,799
Survivors ready?

364
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,805
Go!

365
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,767
What are they gonna do?

366
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,232
(women laughing)

367
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,962
GC's out in front.

368
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,298
Gillian bringing up the rear.

369
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,258
Fang quickly falling behind.

370
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,594
Matty and Dan now going back to

371
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,596
help their tribe.

372
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,098
>> Gotta get 'em on the hill.

373
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,974
Gotta get 'em on the hill.

374
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,853
>> PROBST: GC first to the

375
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,729
hill.

376
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,773
>> Come on, guys.

377
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,692
Almost there.

378
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,153
Keep pushing.

379
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,571
>> PROBST: GC and Marcus

380
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,739
looking out for themselves,

381
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,199
going after that individual

382
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,117
immunity.

383
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,701
Big move to make early in the

384
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,369
game.

385
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:43,911
>> Come on.

386
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,621
Keep it going.

387
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,623
Keep it going.

388
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,291
(Paloma grunts)

389
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,418
>> PROBST: Bob helping out

390
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,253
Paloma for Kota.

391
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,880
Ace pushing her.

392
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,508
Marcus first to the top.

393
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,801
Marcus has the idol for Kota.

394
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,221
Here comes GC for Fang.

395
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,806
Michelle right on his tail.

396
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,352
The rest of Fang lagging behind.

397
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,647
For Fang, GC grabs the idol.

398
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,982
Michelle, the last woman

399
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,109
picked, is the first woman

400
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,694
across.

401
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,445
>> Really don't think the

402
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:21,365
Fang tribe really is that smart.

403
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,367
I was the last one picked, and

404
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,827
I was the first girl up there,

405
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,996
so they can kiss my ass.

406
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,038
>> PROBST: Big question now:

407
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,250
which tribe gets the food?

408
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,751
>> Oh.

409
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,545
>> Come on, girl.

410
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,504
>> Come on, Kota!

411
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:35,838
Let's go!

412
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,840
Come on, guys.

413
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,841
>> PROBST: Kota with a big

414
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,009
lead heading for that food.

415
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:40,384
>> Come on, guys!

416
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:40,968
>> Let's go. Let's go.

417
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,554
>> PROBST: Susie, Gillian,

418
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,930
Crystal really struggling for

419
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:45,848
Fang.

420
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,851
This isn't even close.

421
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,144
Everybody got to be across

422
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,562
the black line.

423
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,356
(Gillian grunts)

424
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,024
(applause)

425
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,609
>> We got it.

426
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,152
>> PROBST: Kota wins the extra

427
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,487
food!

428
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,823
Bag of corn and beans.

429
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,783
Matty just trying to get his

430
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,368
tribe to the top.

431
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,745
>> I think we're screwed in a

432
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,662
lot of physical challenges

433
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,164
because Gillian is going to be

434
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,791
a huge, huge, huge load to

435
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,375
carry.

436
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,835
She's a slow-moving human being.

437
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,005
>> Sorry.

438
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,257
>> Thank you.

439
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,300
>> I know I can run.

440
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,052
But climbing that hill was so

441
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,677
hard.

442
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,012
I had on a dress, and on top of

443
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,223
that, my two shoes weigh at

444
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,893
least ten pounds.

445
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,061
>> That's it.

446
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,854
That's it, Gillian.

447
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,980
>> Good job.

448
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,148
Come on, girl.

449
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,858
Almost, you're almost finished.

450
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,610
>> PROBST: Fang finally crosses

451
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,946
the finish line.

452
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,906
All right, so Marcus has the

453
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,033
idol for Kota.

454
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,119
GC got the idol for Fang.

455
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:49,870
Kota was the first tribe to get

456
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,789
everybody to the top.

457
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,957
You win the extra bag of corn

458
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,707
and beans.

459
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,584
(applause)

460
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,835
>> PROBST: I got to say, Fang,

461
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,504
if this is any indicator,

462
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,088
it's going to be a long run

463
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,464
for you guys.

464
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,966
That wasn't even close.

465
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,384
All right, Fang, grab your

466
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,927
stuff, including the map, to

467
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,055
your new tribe home.

468
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:08,889
All right, Kota, grab all your

469
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,225
stuff, including that very

470
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,935
important extra bag of food and

471
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:44,049
head out.

472
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,719
(elephant trumpeting)

473
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,304
(monkey squawking)

474
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,349
>> Being this far out in nature

475
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,184
in the middle of this huge

476
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,769
jungle is definitely an

477
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,937
unnerving experience.

478
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,938
(monkey squawking)

479
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:58,480
You don't know what's around

480
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,106
the next tree.

481
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:04,028
It's really, really scary.

482
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,696
We emerged from the jungle and

483
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,280
we look down and we see the

484
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,449
flag for Kota waving in the

485
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:08,949
breeze.

486
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,200
There's this beautiful lake,

487
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,660
and in front of it are a couple

488
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,120
of broken-down huts.

489
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:13,996
(applause)

490
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,081
It was such a joy to see that

491
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,541
there was some shelter kind of

492
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,250
established.

493
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,418
>> It's crazy.

494
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,919
>> It's a wild, wild place, and

495
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:21,503
you don't want to be out there

496
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,421
exposed to animals.

497
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,505
I mean, the rest of the tribe

498
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,423
could be sitting there and we

499
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,341
could be getting eaten by a

500
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,258
leopard and no one would know

501
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,301
the difference.

502
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,054
>> We have the canoe.

503
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,347
>> We have a dock.

504
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,348
That's awesome.

505
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,517
>> I love it.

506
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,310
I'm excited.

507
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,645
This place looks beautiful.

508
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,562
(laughs)

509
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,897
But there's really wild animals

510
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,439
out here.

511
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:40,981
(laughs)

512
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,984
This is really Africa.

513
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,861
So I'm not going to get in the

514
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,237
water right now, and I'm not

515
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,822
going to be bathing or swimming

516
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,491
in the lake with my tribe mates.

517
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,533
(laughs)

518
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:55,537
>> Hey, we need to work on the

519
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,580
roof.

520
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,206
>> It's about to rain.

521
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,917
>> I'm feeling sprinkles.

522
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,588
>> Okay, let's pass these out

523
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,172
now.

524
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,507
>> We got to layer it up.

525
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,549
>> Okay, okay.

526
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,177
>> We're pretty solid.

527
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,512
>> Do you need more twine?

528
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,263
>> Just give me a piece, like, a

529
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,140
foot long.

530
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,183
>> Ugh, Bob-- he's just like the

531
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,142
forever Boy Scout.

532
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,561
>> Go, Bob.

533
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,062
Go, Bob.

534
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,022
Let's give him some moral

535
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:22,231
support.

536
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,107
>> Bob, he's totally like, he

537
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,775
gets it together.

538
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,652
He's got the camp running really

539
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,111
smoothly.

540
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,112
>> Yeah, it's looking really

541
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:28,404
good, man.

542
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,113
>> He's 57 years old, and he's

543
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,490
awesome.

544
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,200
>> Good job, guys.

545
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,118
(applause)

546
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,079
>> Whoo!

547
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,455
>> I've done a lot of stuff

548
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,248
around camp.

549
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,374
To me, it's common sense.

550
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,166
I come from Maine.

551
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,459
You know, that's what we do in

552
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,001
Maine.

553
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,002
>> ...exactly together.

554
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:44,878
>> ...actually use a short

555
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,004
piece of something.

556
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:46,630
>> It's actually turning out to

557
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,257
be a nice-looking bench.

558
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,883
>> This is the coolest stuff.

559
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,051
>> You're the coolest, Bob.

560
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,177
>> I don't like to spend money

561
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:52,636
on stuff, so I tinker.

562
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,388
If I don't know how to do it, I

563
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,556
go to the library and get the

564
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,599
book, look it up and go do it.

565
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,642
I'm going to make something

566
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,018
like this when I get home.

567
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,103
>> Bob, at what point are we

568
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,187
going to eat?

569
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,148
(laughter)

570
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,951
>> Oh, yeah?

571
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:16,702
Oh, great.

572
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,327
We got some huts to begin with.

573
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,204
Awesome.

574
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,164
>> This will work.

575
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,331
>> This will work.

576
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,666
Yeah, all right, so,

577
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,001
apparently, according to some

578
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,669
people, we sucked today.

579
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,170
I don't think so.

580
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,048
I thought we were awesome.

581
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:29,673
And I think that's what we need

582
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,341
to do is we've just got to keep

583
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,092
that awesome spirit going.

584
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,219
There's an African word for

585
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,012
"fierce."

586
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,847
It's...<i> bucale!</i>

587
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,431
(all chattering)

588
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,307
>> I don't know if I believe

589
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,183
you on that.

590
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,726
>> All right.

591
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,269
(cheering)

592
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,605
I always try and maintain a

593
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,189
positive attitude, and I just

594
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,816
hope that our tribe, the Fang

595
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,027
tribe, will stay positive.

596
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,487
This is cool.

597
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,405
Hey, this is awesome.

598
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,656
And maybe they'll forget I was

599
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,074
the old broad that fell up the

600
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:56,283
hill.

601
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,993
(laughs)

602
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,495
Hey, you guys, if anybody finds

603
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,245
any elephant dung, bring it

604
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,497
back.

605
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,206
It burns well.

606
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,291
>> We've been here 20 minutes

607
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,044
and she wants elephant ...

608
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,378
>> Oh, elephant dung.

609
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,256
>> Oh.

610
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,883
>> Isn't that interesting?

611
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,052
Obviously, one has to be wary.

612
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,220
There are elephants around

613
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,262
because there was elephant dung

614
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,430
that we walked over.

615
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,765
But let's hope that they just

616
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,474
keep their distance.

617
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,434
And if we can get fire going, it

618
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,186
will certainly keep animals

619
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,521
from coming around the camp.

620
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,772
So you want to see the elephant

621
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,648
dung?

622
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,440
>> Not really.

623
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,316
>> It's very interesting.

624
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,859
Look.

625
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,027
>> You want to see my dung?

626
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,862
It's interesting, too.

627
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,197
>> They poop out the seeds that

628
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,198
they don't digest.

629
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,282
And we were wondering, maybe

630
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,409
there might be something edible

631
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,410
inside still.

632
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,161
>> Oh, don't even think about

633
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,372
that.

634
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,207
>> This is our first day, and

635
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,959
I've come to the conclusion

636
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,919
that Gillian is annoying.

637
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,711
>> You can.

638
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,171
You can squeeze elephant dung

639
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:51,505
and drink it.

640
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,091
>> She is so busy at just

641
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,884
trying to look busy, and she's

642
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,178
not accomplishing crap.

643
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,306
>> You know, here.

644
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,266
>> I know.

645
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,351
>> Kick it open.

646
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,269
>> They're in there.

647
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,187
You want, you want to be the

648
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,272
first to try a termite?

649
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,314
>> You don't have to cook them,

650
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:09,773
right?

651
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,607
You can just eat them.

652
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,859
>> You just eat them.

653
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,151
I found a queen one.

654
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,403
This is a lot of protein.

655
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,947
As a professional gamer, there

656
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,949
is a stereotype that, you know,

657
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:19,950
you're antisocial, you're a

658
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:20,492
nerd, and you sit in your

659
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,285
basement all the time.

660
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,662
And of course, I mean, girls

661
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,413
don't dig that.

662
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,372
Are you going to eat it?

663
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,623
Are you really going to eat it?

664
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,002
It'll be hot if do you that.

665
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:30,419
Everything that...

666
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,629
You ate it?

667
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,338
How'd it taste?

668
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,131
>> I don't know.

669
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,132
I just swallowed it.

670
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,217
>> You got some protein.

671
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,429
>> I just ate a termite.

672
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,513
>> That was hot.

673
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,182
>> My God, I just ate a termite!

674
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,057
(laughs)

675
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,726
>> Back home, I am very shy with

676
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,894
the girls that I like.

677
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,896
Last girl I kissed was

678
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,980
actually in high school.

679
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,815
That was, like, four, five years

680
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,902
ago, which is a long time.

681
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,444
That was the queen termite.

682
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,278
That wasn't any ordinary

683
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,613
termite.

684
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,405
>> I know, you gave me

685
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,281
something special there.

686
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,032
Like, seriously...

687
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,033
>> Yeah, that was my gift to

688
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:01,199
you.

689
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,326
>> Thank you.

690
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,578
>> But being here in Gabon with

691
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,245
a girl that, you know, you are

692
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,331
attracted to is a very special

693
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,374
moment in life.

694
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,335
I mean, I am single, and she is

695
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,002
single.

696
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,045
You never know.

697
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,338
A romance could start.

698
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,590
>> It tasted like chocolate.

699
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,925
(Ken mutters)

700
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,475
>> We've got the cantinas right

701
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,100
now.

702
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,477
Why don't we try and do all the

703
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,770
other stuff, get a great camp,

704
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,896
and then we'll work on getting

705
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,272
the water and fire.

706
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,482
>> Um, just from personal need,

707
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,442
where are we going to put the

708
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,151
latrines?

709
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:36,735
>> Do you guys want us to dig,

710
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,363
like, a three-foot, like, thing?

711
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,739
>> No, not a deep hole.

712
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,990
>> So then what are we doing?

713
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,742
Does everybody individually dig

714
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,035
their own hole, poop, and then

715
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:45,452
cover it up?

716
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,536
>> The Roman legions used to

717
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,162
do it...

718
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:47,537
The latrine moves.

719
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,915
So we cut down, we cut down a

720
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,334
foot, and then we cover it up.

721
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,835
And when it's completely flat

722
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,962
again, we move the latrine.

723
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,088
I don't want to punish you guys.

724
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,005
I mean, I'll go do it.

725
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:57,965
>> I don't mind doing the

726
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:58,423
latrine.

727
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm just confused on how to do

728
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:05,514
it.

729
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,848
>> I'm the full package.

730
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,642
I'm not just a physical

731
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,518
competitor.

732
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,727
I'm a mental competitor.

733
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,520
I have no fear of being the

734
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,396
sole survivor.

735
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,107
I have no fear of standing in

736
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,609
front of Jeff and expecting my

737
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,861
check for a million dollars.

738
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,239
What I've done at the moment is

739
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,157
give suggestions, let other

740
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,367
people carry them out, take

741
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,660
some of the benefit, and then

742
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,619
they go, "But you know who

743
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,620
suggested that, right?

744
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:28,829
Ace."

745
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,789
Why don't we go into two groups

746
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,415
and get some really dry wood and

747
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,960
try and do the fire thing?

748
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,425
>> Ace, he's like charismatic,

749
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,718
and I think he has a plan.

750
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,636
Like, he's here to play hard.

751
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,887
I think the best strategy right

752
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,264
now is to just lay low.

753
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,557
>> Our best bet is probably to,

754
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,642
like, let Ace run the show for

755
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,226
a while.

756
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,310
My prediction is Ace is going

757
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,186
to get obnoxious.

758
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,563
Like, let's sort of let him, if

759
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,564
he can, dig his own grave for a

760
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,732
while.

761
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,607
>> People say you don't need

762
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,650
friends here, but if you can

763
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,776
find a friend or someone you

764
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,486
trust, I think that's, like, it

765
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,071
means a lot.

766
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,031
And, like, I was like, I'll

767
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,823
either be playing this game

768
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,991
alone or find someone who I have

769
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:06,408
a connection with.

770
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,201
I feel that I have a special

771
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,411
bond with Marcus.

772
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,537
Ever since I saw him on the mat

773
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,372
and he picked me, I just felt

774
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,666
this connection in his deep,

775
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,209
blue, beautiful eyes.

776
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:16,835
>> Do you think I had any doubt

777
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,087
that you're a well-balanced

778
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,047
human being-- like, I wouldn't

779
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,672
be talking to you like this if I

780
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,715
did, so...

781
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,049
>> Okay, cool.

782
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:22,507
All right.

783
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,634
It feels good to, like, trust

784
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,844
one person at least.

785
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,094
>> Yeah.

786
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,763
The thing with Charlie is I

787
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,972
think he's attracted to me.

788
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,223
But, you know, I'll be honest.

789
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:30,807
Like, I don't see any romance

790
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,267
with Charlie and I.

791
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,185
I think he's a great guy.

792
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:33,769
You know, I can see that he's

793
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,312
handsome and smart and all

794
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,146
those things, and I really

795
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:36,938
can appreciate that about him,

796
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,606
um, but it's not really the way

797
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,523
I roll.

798
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,608
>> You're a nice guy, and you

799
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,817
know it.

800
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,443
>> Yeah, I'm chill, that's all.

801
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,612
I'm straight, so we're in

802
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,280
Eden, but there's no two Adams

803
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,031
here.

804
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,325
(both chuckle)

805
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,711
(trumpeting)

806
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,921
>> Don't they have more bears

807
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:01,129
than...

808
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,005
>> Shh, there it is!

809
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:02,297
There it is.

810
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,007
>> You guys hear that?

811
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,384
>> What is that?

812
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,134
>> Sounds like something

813
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,054
calling.

814
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,056
(trumpeting)

815
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:11,640
>> There it was again.

816
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,809
(elephant trumpeting)

817
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,185
>> The animals are starting to

818
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,186
lurk around camp.

819
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,479
There's an elephant 30 yards

820
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,815
from our house, just cruising

821
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,440
through the forest right behind

822
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,735
our little huts, so it's a

823
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,569
little bit frightening.

824
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,738
(elephant trumpeting)

825
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,157
>> Shh, shh, shh.

826
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:29,533
(rustling)

827
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,200
>> Ow!

828
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,118
>> Oh, no!

829
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:31,660
>> I think I have a small

830
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:31,868
scratch.

831
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,245
>> See it?

832
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,329
>> Holy crap.

833
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,413
>> I was walking back to camp

834
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,082
and I was kneeling down to get

835
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,625
into our little house and I hit

836
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,253
my head on a sharp branch.

837
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,713
The second I hit my head, I felt

838
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,464
the blood running down my face.

839
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,632
I don't know how bad it is.

840
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,509
All I know is it's bleeding a

841
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,552
hell of a lot.

842
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,845
Nurse, do you know anything

843
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,929
about scratches?

844
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,932
>> Well, hmm.

845
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,225
Sorry, can't see a thing.

846
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,227
>> It was totally dark around

847
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:57,811
here.

848
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,187
>> There I am, this nurse in the

849
00:23:59,271 --> 00:23:59,938
dark.

850
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,731
A real clinical challenge for me

851
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,649
and everybody's looking at me

852
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,692
like I'm going to be able to do

853
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,109
something about it.

854
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,237
Yeah, right.

855
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,741
>> Right.

856
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,784
>> At the risk of being like a

857
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,578
mother, you've got to really

858
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,121
take care of yourself out here.

859
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:16,705
Just be careful; otherwise,

860
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,206
you're going to get hurt.

861
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,083
So, we've called the medical to

862
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,127
come and take a look at it.

863
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:26,840
>> You can use that anesthesia

864
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,217
any time you want.

865
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,636
A .22 gauge needle.

866
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,181
It's going to sting, Randy.

867
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,307
>> Break up the monotony of our

868
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,475
first night here.

869
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,895
>> You'll feel a sharp sting.

870
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,937
My suspicion is you're going to

871
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,898
need a few stitches there.

872
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,273
>> Just a couple?

873
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,484
>> Yeah, yeah.

874
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:46,735
You okay?

875
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,613
>> The cut is smarting a little

876
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,198
bit.

877
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,866
No need to stop; just go for it.

878
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,910
>> Yeah, get it done.

879
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,381
All right?

880
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,758
>> Just so I stay in the game.

881
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,468
I can live with the scar.

882
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:11,885
I couldn't see it.

883
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,594
I don't have eyes on the top of

884
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,179
my head.

885
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,513
I didn't know if it was three

886
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,014
stitches or 30 stitches.

887
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,974
I knew it was bleeding a lot.

888
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,352
But leaving this game is not an

889
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:20,894
option.

890
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,396
And I am petrified that this

891
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,773
injury could take me out of the

892
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,816
game.

893
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,456
(trumpeting)

894
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,123
>> You hungry?

895
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:42,832
Man, we've got some good food.

896
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,333
>> Yeah, we got some...

897
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,459
>> Like what?

898
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,293
>> Grasshoppers and crickets

899
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,711
and...

900
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,879
>> Eww.

901
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,755
>> Who wants them?

902
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,215
>> You might want them.

903
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,549
>> I'm full.

904
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,468
(laughter)

905
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,512
Last night, I cut my head.

906
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,846
The doctors were great.

907
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,223
I think it only took, like, two

908
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,140
or three stitches.

909
00:25:59,224 --> 00:25:59,724
I don't know.

910
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,936
And they put this huge bandage

911
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:03,812
on it.

912
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,397
But it's better today than it

913
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:05,981
was yesterday, which means it

914
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,857
will be fine in a couple days.

915
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,197
>> I'm supposed to be on the

916
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:14,739
frigging equator.

917
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,117
Where the hell is the sun?

918
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,660
Seriously, like, I'm just

919
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:22,247
freezing.

920
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:22,664
>> Look at her.

921
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,665
She's miserable.

922
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,459
>> Think you'll be...

923
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,168
>> It's really, really, really

924
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:27,877
cold at night.

925
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,255
And I'm really bony, so I'm

926
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,757
sleeping bone on wood, and I

927
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,092
don't have any, like, cushion,

928
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,303
so nights are definitely the

929
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,137
hardest.

930
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,513
>> You got some fire?

931
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:38,888
>> No.

932
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,514
>> Bone is pretty hard, isn't

933
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,223
it?

934
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:40,807
>> Not hard enough to create

935
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,433
spark.

936
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:41,808
>> No.

937
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,685
>> You don't think?

938
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,478
I don't think that's going to

939
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,022
work.

940
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,440
>> Trying to make fire with a

941
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,442
bone.

942
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,026
I don't think I got stuck with

943
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:51,860
the brightest bunch, that's for

944
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,486
sure.

945
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,779
I just kind of keep thinking

946
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:55,989
"Why did I get stuck with all

947
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,115
these people and the other

948
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,408
team's got all, like, these

949
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,201
smart, beautiful people, and I'm

950
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,329
stuck with these dorks?"

951
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:21,389
>> Where is the tree mail?

952
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,850
There it is.

953
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,268
Our first tree mail.

954
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:25,852
>> Let's bring it back.

955
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,644
>> Yeah.

956
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,562
>> Let's bring it back to camp.

957
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,481
>> Okay, let's do it.

958
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,440
>> Okay.

959
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,066
"You've had a cold, dark night

960
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,776
in the jungle, and your

961
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,569
situation is feeling dire.

962
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:35,528
Wouldn't you love some

963
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,113
security and a nice, big roaring

964
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,156
fire?

965
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,657
>> Yeah!

966
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,533
>> "Well, you'd better move

967
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,159
together for a chance to win the

968
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,243
flame.

969
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,203
If you're not the first to

970
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,537
finish, you may be the first to

971
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,124
leave the game."

972
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,751
>> All right, so we're going to

973
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,835
do a little combined meditation.

974
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,589
So, focus on something.

975
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,633
Hands up.

976
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,886
Going into this challenge,

977
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,346
I wanted us all to be, like,

978
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,889
really in sync, so I felt a

979
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,558
little yoga would really sort

980
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,560
of clean out our humors, get

981
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,312
our energy flowing; the chakras

982
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,315
would be all in tine.

983
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:12,899
And just get us excited and

984
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,984
motivated for this next

985
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:15,777
challenge.

986
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,487
Just breathe into it if you feel

987
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,655
any sort of shudder.

988
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,280
(snickers)

989
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,241
>> I should be stretching too.

990
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,125
(laughing)

991
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:58,528
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

992
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,154
You guys ready to get to

993
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,113
today's challenge?

994
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:00,780
>> Yes.

995
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,406
>> Yeah.

996
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:01,781
>> Definitely.

997
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,323
>> PROBST: All right, for

998
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,534
today's challenge, six tribe

999
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,619
members will be belted together.

1000
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,496
You will race through a swamp,

1001
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,374
over a net wall, under and over

1002
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:11,958
a series of hitching posts.

1003
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,878
You'll then dig up three bags

1004
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,921
of puzzle pieces...

1005
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,839
and make your way to the finish

1006
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,508
where the three remaining

1007
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,135
tribe members will use those

1008
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,553
pieces to solve the puzzle.

1009
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,473
First tribe to solve the puzzle

1010
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,766
wins.

1011
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,350
Want to know what you're

1012
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:29,851
playing for?

1013
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,480
>> Yeah.

1014
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,231
>> Immunity.

1015
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,024
>> Immunity!

1016
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,817
>> PROBST: This is the most

1017
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,486
important thing in this game.

1018
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,028
When you have immunity, you

1019
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,655
cannot be voted out.

1020
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,574
Without it, you are vulnerable.

1021
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,158
>> Yeah.

1022
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,242
>> PROBST: Winning tribe wins

1023
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,412
immunity and fire in the form of

1024
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:49,871
flint.

1025
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,498
(cheering)

1026
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:51,915
>> Yeah!

1027
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:52,874
>> PROBST: Losers go to Tribal

1028
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,627
Council, where somebody will be

1029
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,253
the first person voted out of

1030
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,213
this game.

1031
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:58,838
Going to give you a minute to

1032
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,130
strategize.

1033
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,509
We'll get started.

1034
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,051
All right, so it's Paloma,

1035
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,136
Sugar, and Bob solving the

1036
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,929
puzzle for Kota.

1037
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,473
For Fang, it is Susie, Gillian,

1038
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,058
and Randy.

1039
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,227
For immunity and fire,

1040
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,563
survivors ready?

1041
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,064
Go!

1042
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:16,981
>> Go, Kota!

1043
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,858
>> Go!

1044
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,110
>> First leg is through a

1045
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,530
leech-filled swamp.

1046
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,908
>> Kota! Kota!

1047
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,368
>> Neck and neck through the

1048
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,411
swamp.

1049
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,624
>> Kota!

1050
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,124
>> Push it!

1051
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,335
Push it!

1052
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,127
>> PROBST: Kota with a bit of a

1053
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:38,920
lead.

1054
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,796
>> Go!

1055
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,922
>> Go, Kota!

1056
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,467
>> Go on! Keep moving it!

1057
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,053
>> PROBST: Go! Keep it moving!

1058
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,097
Everybody's got to get over!

1059
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,893
Corrine and Kelly are stuck.

1060
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,936
>> Go, go, go, go!

1061
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,522
>> PROBST: Fang now in the lead!

1062
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,649
>> Yeah, let's go, Fang!

1063
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,066
>> Good job, guys!

1064
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,943
>> PROBST: Got to go under, then

1065
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,611
over.

1066
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,112
Fang at the lead at the

1067
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,905
crawl-under.

1068
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,116
Kota right behind.

1069
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,368

here.

1072
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,789
Fire and immunity.

1073
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:15,999
You don't want to go to Tribal

1074
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,875
Council.

1075
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,961
>> You got it! You made it! Go!

1076
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,170
>> PROBST: Fang still with the

1077
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,005
lead!

1078
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,633

bags of puzzle pieces.

Got a friendly exchange of dirt

1082
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,683
going on.

1083
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,018
It's not a playground.

1084
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,061
Million-dollar game.

1085
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,690
>> Whoo!

1086
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,608

We got to get some fire for

1092
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:46,863
real.

1093
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,532
>> Keep digging!

1094
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,575
>> I got a bag.

Kota has their second bag of

00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,253
puzzle pieces.

1105
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,422
Fang still trying to get that

1106
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,924
first bag out.

remaining two bags.

1114
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,731
Exhaustion is setting in.

1115
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,191
>> Come on, guys. Help us.

1116
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:23,566
>> Let's go, guys.

1117
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,901
>> Try and get the sand off.

Don't throw it back in.

Start solving it.

1127

>> I teach physics, so I was all

1128
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,383
excited to do the puzzle.

1129
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,759
It's like working in the

1130
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,593
classroom.

1136
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,562
>> Come on, guys, right here.

1137
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,814
>> PROBST: Kota has the first

1138
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,566
third of their puzzle solved.

1139
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,694
Two bags left.

1140
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,861
>> You're fine! Keep going!

1141
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,699
>> Okay, these two go together.

1142
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,033
>> Kota on their last part of

1143
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,577
the puzzle now.

1144
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,121
This challenge is an absolute

1145
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,288
blowout at this point.

1146
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,124
>> Dig fast! Dig!

1147
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,167
>> PROBST: It might be time to

1148
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,043
put it in the deep freeze,

1149
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:24,502
Gillian.

1150
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,461
You might be out of it.

1151
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,254
>> Nothing's gone till it's

1152
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,296
gone.

1153
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,297
>> I'm really tired of that

1154
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,298
accent.

1155
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,384
I understand "never quit", but

1156
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,177
dude, we lost.

1157
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,596
>> Come on, guys!

1158
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,223
Keep going!

1159
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,141
It's not over till it's over!

1160
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,935
>> Fang, let's go! Come on!

1161
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,603
>> You're okay!

1162
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,646
>> PROBST: Fang coming around

1163
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,648
the corner, but it's too late.

1164
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,232
Kota wins immunity and fire!

1165
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,192
(cheering)

1166
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,826
>> Boy, that was brutal.

1167
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,327
>> PROBST: All right, well, so

1168
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,288
far, three days in, this is not

1169
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,080
even close.

1170
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,248
Two absolute blowouts.

1171
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,376
Kota, congratulations.

1172
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,502
(cheering)

1173
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,253
>> Yeah!

1174
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:07,795
>> PROBST: Immunity, nobody

1175
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,048
going home tonight.

1176
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,133
Also, the other half, fire in

1177
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:16,721
the form of flint.

1178
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,139
Fang, the only thing I have for

1179
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,223
you is a date with me tonight

1180
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,892
at Tribal Council, where one of

1181
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,852
you will be going home tonight.

1182
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,561
Grab your stuff.

1183
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,605
Head back to camp.

1184
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,144
(trumpeting)

1185
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,484
>> Good job, you guys.

1186
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,527
>> We did not get destroyed.

1187
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,528
>> All right, awesome.

1188
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,570
>> And we are not unorganized.

1189
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,613
>> We were winning till the

1190
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,614
third quarter.

1191
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,615
>> Okay, guys.

1192
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,908
>> We lost another challenge.

1193
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,701
We could have had fire tonight,

1194
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,161
and most importantly, we could

1195
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,163
have kept our tribe together.

1196
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,498
>> We need somebody, and none of

1197
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,332
us want to do it, step up and

1198
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,501
say, "I'm leader."

1199
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,419
>> I'm the only one who is not

1200
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,546
worried about getting voted off

1201
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,880
because I did win that first

1202
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,714
immunity challenge.

1203
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,298
And it feels good, but at the

1204
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,383
same time, there is nobody

1205
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,677
stepped up as a leader of the

1206
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,678
tribe.

1207
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,096
So, we got to have some kind of

1208
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:46,143
game plan.

1209
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:46,936
>> What are you hearing,

1210
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,228
anything?

1211
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:47,603
>> Yeah, Michelle.

1212
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,312
>> Why is our team better

1213
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,856
without Michelle?

1214
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,690
>> Because right now we're...

1215
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,774
>> I'm not arguing with you.

1216
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,900
>> ...we're in a down-and-out

1217
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,486
position; we need positivity.

1218
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,071
She's negative; she doesn't want

1219
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:57,613
to be here; she's miserable.

1220
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,406
>> I'm up in the air.

1221
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,074
I'll do whatever.

1222
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:00,867
>> Michelle.

1223
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,868
>> Michelle. Michelle.

1224
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,702
>> That's a good reason...

1225
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,036
>> You know what, you do what

1226
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,537
you think you got to do.

1227
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,539
That's who I'm gonna go with.

1228
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,582
>> That's who I'm going for.

1229
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,875
As of now, I'm voting Michelle.

1230
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,668
>> Just let me know where you're

1231
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,294
at-- I'm there.

1232
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,129
>> Me, too.

1233
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,547
>> Are you guys feeling me or

1234
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,714
no?

1235
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,799
Randy, you look like you're not

1236
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,426
feeling me good.

1237
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,510
>> It's early.

1238
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,721
I'm-I'm... I hear you.

1239
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,848
>> It's not<i> that</i> early.

1240
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,392
>> If I believed that Michelle

1241
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,768
was getting five, six, seven,

1242
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,394
eight votes tonight, I'd have no

1243
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,312
problem voting for her.

1244
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,648
It's just, I don't buy it yet.

1245
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,941
>> Hot.

1246
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,483
>> Get out of the sun, then.

1247
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,111
>> I would prefer Gillian to go

1248
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:40,072
tonight, just because... she's a

1249
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,325
60-year-old woman.

1250
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:42,783
Nothing against the

1251
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,619
60-year-old women out there,

1252
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,455
but don't come to<i> my</i> camp.

1253
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,289
>> You guys were great.

1254
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,707
You just had to dig differently,

1255
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,333
and that's all.

1256
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,834
>> I didn't think about that.

1257
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,044
>> So just because it seems

1258
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,295
like we're disorganized, I don't

1259
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,590
think any of us think we are.

1260
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,300
>> She cheerleads and blows

1261
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,010
sunshine, thinking they're gonna

1262
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,137
like her, but, to be honest,

1263
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,805
Gillian is worthless, totally

1264
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,767
worthless.

1265
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,435
>> So, who's leaving tonight?

1266
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,269
>> I really want to... want to

1267
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,479
vote out Gillian.

1268
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,649
>> That's what I was thinking.

1269
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,358
She's the oldest and would slow

1270
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,360
us down the most.

1271
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,570
>> Gillian is our weakest

1272
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,780
member, like, in everything, and

1273
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,948
we do need physical players

1274
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,950
right now.

1275
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,451
Like, she's a nice lady, but I

1276
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,786
don't think she's meant for this

1277
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:26,994
game.

1278
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:27,620
I don't know how everybody else

1279
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,330
is gonna vote.

1280
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,207
I think you're on the outs right

1281
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:31,457
now.

1282
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,167
>> Really?

1283
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,919
>> Yeah. I mean, we're the...

1284
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,504
>> That's so funny 'cause that

1285
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,005
would just, like, confirm my

1286
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:38,506
belief in this tribe that

1287
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,257
they're, like, the dumbest

1288
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,092
people on earth.

1289
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,343
>> You don't talk to anybody

1290
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,762
besides me, so they do think...

1291
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,055
>> They're all retarded. Like...

1292
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:46,722
>> I know.

1293
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,599
I would really rather keep

1294
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,392
Michelle in this tribe because

1295
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,103
I really do like Michelle, and I

1296
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,731
really do think that she would

1297
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,066
be allies with me.

1298
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,693
>> It's hard for me to pretend

1299
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,487
to like people that... really

1300
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,321
frustrate me.

1301
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,364
>> I seriously don't know what's

1302
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,615
gonna go on at Tribal Council

1303
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:04,865
tonight.

1304
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,076
I think it's gonna be a mixed

1305
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,328
vote.

1306
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:09,829
>> She's Negative Nancy.

1307
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,372
>> And there will be no

1308
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,832
hesitation in me tonight to vote

1309
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,125
Michelle off for that whole

1310
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:14,834
reason.

1311
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,334
>> Me, neither.

1312
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:15,751
>> She's-she's sad.

1313
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,586
She just doesn't need to be

1314
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,088
here.

1315
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,214
I personally had absolutely no

1316
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,841
qualms about myself voting for

1317
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,843
Michelle.

1318
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,468
I'm sorry, but I think Michelle

and for our sake.

1321
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,973
She's just having too hard a

1322
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:29,598
time, and it's not good for all

1323
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,392
of us.

1324
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,394
Bad vibes is just not a good

1325
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,480
thing to have around.

1326
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,815
I might be the naive woman

1327
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,899
that's just walking around

1328
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,525
thinking, "Tra-la, it's not me,

1329
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,737
thank God," um, but it may be.

1330
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,238
Uh, I doubt it, though.

1331
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:44,780
I really feel Michelle just

1332
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,533
doesn't want to be here.

Grab a torch, approach a flame,

1337

dip it in, and get fire.

1338
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,653
This is part of the ritual of

1339

think you did at today's

1351

1354
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,600
better than we expected.

>> PROBST: So in addition to

1359
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,189
being a complete disaster, this

1360

1361
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,316
>> I disagree.

1362
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,776
I don't think it was a complete

1363

and utter<i> disaster.</i>

1364
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:05,778

play-by-play.

1370
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,410
You were in there.

1371
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,245
What was going on?

1372
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,788
>> Well, it took a long time,

1373
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,997
and there were people taking

1374
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:17,456
breaks.

1375
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,250

>> I'm-I'm sorry. I got tired.

1379
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,630
I mean, I got exhausted, so,

1380
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,091
yeah, I took a break.

1381
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,425
If that was the reason we lost,

1382
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,718
I'm sorry, but, I mean...

1383
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,137
>> Well, it wasn't the reason we

1384
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,847
won 'cause we're sitting here.

1385
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,556

the time.

1388
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:36,684
>> Um, that's what a challenge

1389
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,686
is, that's what a race is.

1390
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,146
You don't stop till the job is

1391
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:40,980
done.

1392
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,106
>> Oh, for Pete's sake, then why

1393
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:42,648
didn't you step up at that

1394
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,733
point and just get right on it?

1395
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,276
>> I didn't stop digging.

1396
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:45,901
>> But you should've verbalized

1397
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,902
it.

1398
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,028
You should've said, "Hey, will

1399
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:48,529
you do this?"

1400
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,572
>> That's what I was doing.

1401
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,656
"Come on, y'all, hustle!"

1402
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,490
>> All right, all right, you're

1403
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,575
right.

1404
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,326
(several talking at once)

1405
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,536
>> There was a barrier there, so

1406
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,829
we could not see you guys.

1407
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,955
>> I just thought it's common

1408
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,123
sense that, you know, when we're

1409
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,416
in a race that you don't stop

1410
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:05,171
until we're done or we win.

1411
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,213
>> PROBST: Well, I'll tell you

1412
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,089
what I just saw.

1413
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:07,715
I asked a simple question, and

1414
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,800
immediately you guys went into

1415
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,304
arguing about something else.

1416
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,805
So, Crystal, who's leading this

1417
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,848
tribe?

1418
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,474
>> Right now, at this current

1419
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,934
moment, we don't have a distinct

1420
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,519
leader.

1421
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,480
It's frustrating.

1422
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,647
>> PROBST: Gillian, you started

1423
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,065
picking this tribe.

1424
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,692
Are you happy with the fact that

1425
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,235
you still don't have any

1426
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,111
leadership?

1427
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,362
>> I think there are plenty

1428
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:30,905
leaders in the group, but I

1429
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,865
think that a lot of people feel

1430
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,949
like it's kind of the death

1431
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,910
knell to... to come out as the

1432
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,118
leader.

1433
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,453
>> PROBST: Anybody willing to

1434
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,787
step up and say, "I think I

1435

could help us avoid coming to

1436
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,541
Tribal Council"?

1437
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,751
Anybody willing?

1438
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,585
>> I think it would be a good

1439
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,254
idea if we had someone who we

1440
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,381
all looked up to and said, "You

1441
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:49,965
could definitely be the leader

1442
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,051
of our tribe," but since none of

1443
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,010
us have that feeling toward...

1444
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:53,761
>> I think you could.

1445
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,054
>> I happen to think you could,

1446
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:55,221
too.

1447
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,847
>> I think it needs to be

1448
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,431
discussed.

1449
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:57,973

opinions or strategies, I think

1453
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,020
you got a great style.

1454

>> I appreciate you guys saying

1455
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,940
that, but maybe I don't have the

courage to be the leader

1457
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,150
because I don't want to lead you

1458
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,276

1459
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,070

1460
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:11,862
making that decision.

1461

But if I was volunteered, I'll

1462
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,614
take it.

1463
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,491
If they want me to roll with it,

1464
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,533

>> I didn't say that, either.

1469
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,705

Fang has a leader, and his name

1495

is GC.

1496
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,403
Good.

1497
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,321

out here?

>> Probably... Ken.

1501
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,535

you're there, it's like even

1688
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:50,237
though I'm not there, like, I

1689
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,406
feel like, I'm there in spirit,

1690
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,532
and I'm, like, yeah, like,

1691
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,950
someone's gonna back me up

1692
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:55,534
if I'm, like, knocked down.

1693
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,159
Our alliance is, like,

1694
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,161
clearly...

1695
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,496
I just can't imagine

1696
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,622
there being a stronger one.

1697
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,248
>> I think you just have to see

1698
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,417
how every day it stacks up and

1699
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,377
gets stronger and stronger.

1700
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,721
I kind of have this inner circle

1701
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,638
bond with Charlie.

1702
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,265
I look at it like layers of an

1703
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,141
onion.

1704
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,017
And I think Charlie's

1705
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,269
the guy that's sort of the

1706
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,603
innermost layer, then we're

1707
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,187
adding people as we go along.

1708
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,357
I, I talked to Jacquie a little

1709
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,275
bit, you know?

1710
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,735
She seems like a really cool

1711
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:30,569
girl.

1712
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,071
And I am totally psyched

1713
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,823
'cause I know she likes you.

1714
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:35,449
Like, I think Jacquie might get

1715
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,075
along.

1716
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:41,455
>> I think at this point, it's

1717
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,331
looking like the large onion

1718
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,249
alliance, as I might call it:

1719
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:48,044
myself, Charlie, Jacquie,

1720
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,046
Corinne, is what we're shooting

1721
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:50,714
for.

1722
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,007
Jacquie is an awesome girl and

1723
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:52,507
I think she's also very

1724
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,258
intelligent.

1725
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,385
And I think Corinne is probably

1726
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,720
the smartest one around.

1727
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,680
>> I think the best way to

1728
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:59,973
strategize with her is to get

1729
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,266
to know her as a person, like...

1730
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:01,683
>> Yeah.

1731
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:02,809
I'm gonna talk to Corinne

1732
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,561
and kind of get a vibe for her

1733
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,937
'cause no one's really made any

1734
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,106
official pitch at this point.

1735
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:18,116
(buzzing)

1736
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,659
>> If we're going to go look for

1737
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,994
some fruit or something, I think

1738
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,537
it'll be best to do it before it

1739
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,498
gets too hot.

1740
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,124
Susie and Crystal, would y'all

1741
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,126
mind getting fruit?

1742
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,169
Fruit.

1743
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,295
Yeah, Matty, maybe you and Randy

1744
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,213
could find stuff that we could

1745
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,339
use maybe as spoons or bowls or

1746
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,340
something.

1747
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,299
>> Okay.

1748
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,052
>> You know, you get sticks,

1749
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,094
kind of like, like, uh...

1750
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:38,804
>> Shape 'em.

1751
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:39,513
>> Yeah, shape 'em and mix

1752
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,514
foods.

1753
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,306
>> Kenny, if you want to just,

1754
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,558
man, grass or anything, just

1755
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,101
stuff we might could use for a

1756
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,186
good layer.

1757
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,479
Being the leader right now, I

1758
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,980
think, is working out okay.

1759
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,315
I'm just trying to get this camp

1760
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:50,649
put together.

1761
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,108
I'm a maintenance supervisor,

1762
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:52,692
you know, and it's my job to

1763
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,110
build things and get them put

1764
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,111
together.

1765
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,196
I'm like, man, let's just get

1766
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,280
this thing together and let's

1767
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,198
get this ball rolling.

1768
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:58,740
>> If you guys want the best

1769
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,826
bedding, we'd have to weave.

1770
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:01,451
>> At least put down a layer of

1771
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,244
grass, and whatever you're

1772
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,286
talking about weaving, we can

1773
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,246
put on top of that.

1774
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,789
>> Yeah, yeah.

1775
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:06,748
>> So that way, at night we're

1776
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,333
all comfortable.

1777
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,876
>> I guess I can weave all day.

1778
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,460
>> Let's do it.

1779
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:10,961
>> All right, you ready?

1780
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:11,294
>> Yeah.

1781
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,880
So far, the ideas that I present

1782
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,298
to 'em they think are pretty

1783
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,842
good, so we've got a plan for

1784
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:22,389
the day.

1785
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,391
>> We're gonna have to change

1786
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,433
out this water.

1787
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,560
>> This is rice water.

1788
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,853
>> Actually, do you mind if I

1789
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,854
try to make it?

1790
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:29,813
>> What, the rice?

1791
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,816
>> Yeah... if you don't mind.

1792
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:33,859
>> No, of course not.

1793
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:34,776
>> If, if you're all ready, I'll

1794
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,360
start it now.

1795
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:35,944
>> Yeah, tha-that's what I was

1796
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:36,319
doing.

1797
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,572
Just wing it.

1798
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,115
If you get too much water, we

1799
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,366
just cook it longer and...

1800
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,619
>> Okay.

1801
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,412
>> GC, you use lake water.

1802
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,706
All we have up there is clean

1803
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,748
water.

1804
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,708
It's boiled.

1805
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,709
>> Anything wrong with using

1806
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:51,626
clean water?

1807
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,878
>> Yeah, to make rice you got to

1808
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,170
boil it again, and that doesn't

1809
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:54,880
make sense.

1810
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,464
Boil it once and use lake water.

1811
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,008
>> What do you mean we have to

1812
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:58,592
boil it twice?

1813
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,301
It's already boiled.

1814
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,385
It's just water.

1815
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,428
Do you understand what I'm

1816
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,429
saying?

1817
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,097
>> I understand what you're

1818
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:04,806
saying, but you're doing the

1819
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,519
work twice.

1820
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,729
>> It's just water, Randy.

1821
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,189
We're surrounded by water, bro.

1822
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,191
>> I get you.

1823
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,318
>> Our tribe has a leader-- GC--

1824
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,361
but he's too young and he

1825
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,196
doesn't know squat about any of

1826
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,698
this, and my new operation is

1827
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,617
called Operation Let Other

1828
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,618
People Crash and Burn.

1829
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,702
>> Didn't you want us to go get

1830
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,703
fruit?

1831
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:27,621
>> We're going to get leaves for

1832
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:27,829
the bed.

1833
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,039
>> What's happening?

1834
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:29,623
What's cracking?

1835
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,248
Ain't nobody moving.

1836
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,751
>> My best plan right now is

1837
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,377
just to keep my mouth shut, sit

1838
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,296
on my ass, and watch us

1839
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,547
self-destruct.

1840
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,715
>> The king is restless this

1841
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:55,565
morning.

1842
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,652
(monkeys squealing)

1843
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,992
>> I only talked to Jacquie.

1844
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,202
>> Oh, really?

1845
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:07,827
>> For me, at least, I'm only

1846
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,411
putting my-- I trust Jacquie

1847
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,454
wholeheartedly.

1848
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,373
She's like my girl, and I trust

1849
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,374
you.

1850
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,416
>> I like hanging out with you,

1851
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,293
and, like, I think it would be

1852
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,921
great to have, like, a smaller

1853
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:18,922
layer of the group.

1854
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,090
>> Yeah, I think we have a

1855
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,091
really good chance.

1856
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:21,716
I would like the alliance to be,

1857
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,301
like, me, you, and Jacquie,

1858
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,178
tight, strong, Charlie, and then

1859
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,013
just have, like, one, like,

1860
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:27,472
like, loser person.

1861
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,516
>> I think things are kind of

1862
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,101
naturally just going the right

1863
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,102
direction.

1864
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,228
>> Originally when I came in, I

1865
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:33,895
really liked Jacquie and I

1866
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:34,479
really liked Marcus and also

1867
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,438
Charlie 'cause I feel like

1868
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,439
they're really trustworthy.

1869
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,067
I know that that's only four and

1870
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,443
that leaves five out, but that's

1871
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,403
a short-term thing.

1872
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,320
And then we just need a

1873
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,613
peripheral one extra person to

1874
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,156
be in the majority, and Bob is

1875
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,991
really benign.

1876
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:50,829
Like, everyone likes him.

1877
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,831
>> I think Bob's the best,

1878
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:53,832
right?

1879
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:54,833
>> Right.

1880
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,417
>> Bob is our chance.

1881
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,334
If we can convince Bob that

1882
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,419
going with Ace is not the right

1883
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,586
way to go, then, like...

1884
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,879
>> I can bring Bob in, like,

1885
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:00,797
full-on bring him in.

1886
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,381
>> Better situation.

1887
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,091
>> The only, only problem is I

1888
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,509
don't want to give him too much

1889
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:05,468
information.

1890
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,720
>> When Corinne, Marcus,

1891
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,263
Jacquie, and I were out in the

1892
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,305
forest, it was the first time

1893
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:09,889
we ever talked strategy as a

1894
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:10,432
foursome.

1895
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,767
>> If they see us all going off,

1896
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,810
they're probably gonna be like--

1897
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:14,853
everyone is going to get

1898
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,730
nervous.

1899
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,772
>> What should we do?

1900
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,232
This is bad business.

1901
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,233
Let's go back.

1902
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:20,817
>> It was like magic.

1903
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,901
It was like one brain working as

1904
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:22,902
one.

1905
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:23,862
It was amazing.

1906
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,238

1911
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,270
started some time when the moon

1912
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,480
was right above us.

1913
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,981
GC had got up earlier.

1914
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,357
I heard this washing machine

1915
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,400
going, doing lots of, you know,

1916
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,401
the slushy, slushy, slushy

And I thought: just keep it down

1920
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:08,698
so we can all sleep.

1921
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,407
Otherwise we're going to be

1922
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,618

1927
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,334
joined him, and then the talking

1928
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,710
started and more talking,

1929
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:21,920
and more talking, and then

1930
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:22,545
Susie joined them, and then that

00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,255
got even louder.

1936
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,302
last night.

1937
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:29,928
>> Was she?

1938
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,596
>> I have, I have a request.

1939
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,973
I'm going to voice my opinion.

1940
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,226
We have all day to blah, blah,

1941
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:36,810
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1942
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,311
blah, blah.

1943
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,646
Perhaps we could just keep it

1944
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,398
down for certain times during

1945
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,066
the night.

1946
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,151
>> I'm sorry, Gill, but I was,

1947
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,070
I was woke up, like, early this

1948
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,196
morning because five people

1949
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,072
were in there snoring.

1950
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:49,531
>> Yeah, I...

1951
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,281
>> All right?

1952
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,825
So I got up as quietly as I

1953
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:52,033
could.

1954
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:52,659
If other people come out and

1955
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,452
start talking, don't come out to

1956
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,161
me and say...

1957
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,329
>> I didn't say...

1958
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,372
>> It felt like, it felt like

1959
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,289
when you came out, you were

1960
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,165
saying Danny, uh...

1961
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,458
>> If I wanted to attack you, I

1962
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,460
would have said, "Danny, quit

1963
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,837
flapping your gums at night."

1964
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,754
>> I'm a grown man.

1965
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:05,755
Ain't nobody gonna tell me

1966
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:06,798
when I can do something and

1967
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:07,132
when I can't.

1968
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,383
>> Do you see I didn't tell

1969
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,008
you what to do?

1970
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:09,592
>> I'm just telling you.

1971
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,343
>> I just asked.

1972
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,761
I just put in a request-- could

1973
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,971
we keep the blah, blah, blah

1974
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:21,187
down.

1975
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,480
>> We don't need a damn leader.

1976
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,982
I'm younger than all y'all, so

1977
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,817
what I'm being the leader for?

1978
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,943
I didn't want to be a leader,

1979
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,111
I'm not gonna let y'all force me

1980
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:28,778
to be the leader.

1981
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,947
So I'm not going to.

1982
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,490
>> GC, which stands for

1983
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,285
"golden child," resigned as

1984
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,537
leader, which was probably the

1985
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,040
best leadership call he's made

1986
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,584
since he's been leader because

1987
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,294
he hasn't led anything.

1988
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:44,919
>> So, Dan, if you want to step

1989
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,006
up, here's your chance.

1990
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,257
Randy, you want to step up?

1991
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:49,883
I mean, you guys say-- if that's

1992
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,468
what you want, somebody here,

1993
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,053
somebody else's chance.

1994
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,305
And if nobody says nothing, then

1995
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,222
that means we don't need a

1996
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,265
leader because obviously

1997
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:57,849
nobody wants to be a leader.

1998
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,643
>> He's a leader who quit, who

1999
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:01,811
quit this morning.

2000
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,771
It was just the complete

2001
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,106
opposite reaction that you

2002
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,191
would want from any kind of

2003
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:06,399
leader.

2004
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:06,900
>> If you want to be the

2005
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,610
leader, man, I'm telling you...

2006
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,153
>> I-I don't necessarily think

2007
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,696
my management style would-would

2008
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,699
be good for this tribe.

2009
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,242
I-I personally don't.

2010
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,286
So I-I prefer not to.

2011
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,204
Everyone's got their own

2012
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,663
management style, you know.

2013
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,874
I-I know I-I'm highly emotional.

2014
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,584
So I'm not sure my-my management

2015
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,627
style would be any better.

2016
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,170
I would like to be a silent

2017
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:27,921
leader.

2018
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,088
The silent leader is never the

2019
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,506
one that gets the blame, but he

2020
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,091
gets to lead, so that would be

2021
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,220
a great direction.

2022
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:38,181
>> We got mail.

2023
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,098
>> Yeah!

2024
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,475
>> Hey!

2025
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,601

wishing.

2029
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,233
One tribe will have to vote

2030
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:48,858
someone out, the other one will

2031
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,860
soon be fishing."

2032
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:51,569
>> We got tree mail this

2033
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,570
morning, and I definitely think

2034
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,073
we have a chance of winning, but

2035
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,449
we'd have a much better chance

2036
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:59,452
if we were more unified.

2037
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:01,955
(indistinct chatter)

2038
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:02,872
>> Oh, there it is.

2039
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,082
>> Nice.

2040
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,667
>> There it is.

2041
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,335
>> I had the idea of painting

2042
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,003
people's faces with charcoal,

2043
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,296
and that seemed to bring the

2044
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,339
mood up a little bit.

2045
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,632
>> Yeah, this is my "go to war"

2046
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:13,633
face.

2047
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,926
I'm about to tear it up!

2048
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,010
>> Oh, that's good.

2049
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:16,761
>> I'm gonna kick your ass!

2050
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:20,473

00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:46,749
Michelle voted out at the last

2056
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,836
Tribal Council.

2057
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,718
What's with the face paint?

2058
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,177
Gillian?

2059
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,429
>> Unification.

2060
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,638
>> United tribe coming to take

2061
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,808
them on, and, uh, do it.

2062
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,852
>> PROBST: Guys ready to get to

2063
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,186
today's challenge?

2064
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,271
>> ALL: Yeah.

2065
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,272
>> PROBST: First things first.

2066
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,565
I will take back the immunity

2067
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:11,357
idol.

2068
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,233
Thank you, Marcus.

2069
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,318
>> See you in a bit.

2070
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:17,238
(scattered laughter)

2071
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,698
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

2072
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,200
is back up for grabs.

2073
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,827
For today's challenge, on my go,

2074
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,371
both tribes will push a large

2075
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:25,913
boulder through a series of

2076
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:26,873
gates.

2077
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,125
Along the way, you must retrieve

2078
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,835
two sets of three keys.

2079
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,129
When you reach the final gate,

2080
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:33,880
you'll use those keys to open

2081
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,091
three locks, then race to the

2082
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,176
finish.

2083
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:38,760
First tribe to the finish with

2084
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,054
their boulder securely on their

2085
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,722
pedestal wins immunity and

2086
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,723
reward.

2087
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:44,766
Want to know what you're

2088
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,184
playing for on that end?

2089
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,268
(all voicing assent)

2090
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,062
>> PROBST: Here's your reward.

2091
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,063
Fishing gear.

2092
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,064
(applause)

2093
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,065
>> Yeah.

2094
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,274
>> Yeah.

2095
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,442
>> PROBST: Everything you need

2096
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,318
to fish.

2097
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,779
You have hooks, line, netting.

2098
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,405
You have worms.

2099
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,531
Traps.

2100
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:01,532
>> Oh!

2101
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,492
>> PROBST: And a spear.

2102
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,076
>> Oh, we get the business.

2103
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,911
>> PROBST: In addition, the

2104
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,412
winning tribe will choose one

2105
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,747
person from the losing tribe to

2106
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:12,085
go to Exile Island.

2107
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,587
Good news, bad news about Exile.

2108
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,047
Bad news is, when you're away,

2109
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,006
things happen at camp.

2110
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,508
You never want to be away from

2111
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,342
camp.

2112
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,593
Good news-- waiting for you at

2113
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:22,011
Exile Island-- the first clue to

2114
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,304
the location of a hidden

2115
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,138
immunity idol.

2116
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:24,847
If you have immunity as a tribe

2117
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,308
or as an individual, you cannot

2118
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,601
be voted out of this game.

2119
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:29,602
Worth playing for?

2120
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:30,603
>> Absolutely.

2121
01:01:30,686 --> 01:01:30,812
>> Yeah.

2122
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:31,813
>> PROBST: Kota, you have one

2123
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,398
extra member.

2124
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,690
Gonna have to sit somebody out.

2125
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:35,733
Who is it going to be?

2126
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:35,942
>> Me.

2127
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:36,859
>> PROBST: All right, Paloma,

2128
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,861
take a seat on the bench.

2129
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,154
Everybody else, I'll give you

2130
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,197
a minute to strategize.

2131
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,533
We'll get started.

2132
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,494
Here we go.

2133
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:46,994
For immunity and reward,

2134
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,914
Survivors ready?

2135
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:55,044
Go.

2136
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,045
>> Push.

2137
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:56,838
Push more!

2138
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:57,213
Get on the side!

2139
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:57,797
Get on the side.

2140
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,674
>> Susie, Susie.

2141
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:00,675
>> PROBST: These hills are

2142
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:01,551
steep.

2143
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:02,135
You're going to have to dig

2144
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:02,760
deep.

2145
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,720
That ball is heavy.

2146
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:05,763
>> Gillian, get out of the way

2147
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,933
so somebody else can push.

2148
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,020
>> PROBST: Kota with a bit of a

2149
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:13,896
lead.

2150
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,148
Fang right behind, no thanks to

2151
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,149
Gillian.

2152
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,150
Let's go.

2153
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,943
>> And then get around it.

2154
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:19,986
>> PROBST: Kota-- first to their

2155
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,448
first set of keys.

2156
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,490
Fang slowing down right before

2157
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,491
they get there.

2158
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,534
>> Hold it. Hold it.

2159
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:27,076
>> PROBST: Bob working the

2160
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,744
knots for Kota.

2161
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:29,495
>> Let's go.

2162
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,746
>> Okay, if you stabilize this.

2163
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,707
>> PROBST: Head up top for Fang.

2164
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,958
>> Go, Ken!

2165
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,668
>> Come on...

2166
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:36,294
>> PROBST: Bob has the keys for

2167
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:36,794
Kota.

2168
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:37,795
They're heading out.

2169
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:38,796
(woman whoops)

2170
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,797
>> Go, Ken.

2171
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,883
>> PROBST: Ken has the keys for

2172
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:42,091
Fang.

2173
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,925
They're heading out.

2174
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:43,843
>> Guys!

2175
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,762
>> Yeah!

2176
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:47,180
>> How's it going?

2177
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,015
Let's get it over here.

2178
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,475
>> Not too much push.

2179
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:51,559
>> Get there...

2180
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:52,518
>> Let's go.

2181
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,561
>> PROBST: Kota still with a

2182
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:54,937
bit of a lead heading down the

2183
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,024
hill.

2184
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,319
(indistinct chatter)

2185
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:02,069
(boulders banging)

2186
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,321
Major collision between Kota

2187
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,323
and Fang.

2188
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,282
>> Aah!

2189
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,283
>> Lucky key.

2190
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:08,326
>> Go, go, go, go, go!

2191
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,535

>> Up.

2195
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:14,290
>> Okay, you can do it.

2196
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,166
>> Good job, Bob.

2197
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:16,083
>> Good job, Bob.

2198
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,126
Don't look at anybody but

2199
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:17,877
yourself.

2200
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,294

>> Nice, Bob.

2210
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:28,513

>> PROBST: Fang right behind.

2215
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,100
>> Straight.

2216
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,352
Right, right, right.

2217
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:34,852
>> We got it, guys.

2218
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,687
>> Come on.

2219
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,772
Give it all, you guys.

2220
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:38,564
>> Come on.

2221
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,565

but only three locks.

2234
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,497
The question is, how lucky are

2235
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,331
you?

2236
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:56,332

01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:08,712
>> Ow!

2615
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:09,713
No, no, no.

2616
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:10,714
No, no, no, no.

2617
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:11,715
Success!

2618
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:12,716
Finally!

2619
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:14,885
We caught some damn fish around

2620
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:15,886
this place.

2621
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:17,512
>> Now, that is meat.

2622
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:18,889
>> We lost reward challenge that

2623
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:20,307
was supposed to get us fishing

2624
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,933
gear, but we caught fish anyway.

2625
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:21,767
We don't need that stuff.

2626
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,768
We're good.

2627
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:27,064
We're survival experts.

2628
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:27,648
>> We got something.

2629
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,442
We got five sardines.

2630
01:15:30,525 --> 01:15:31,443
>> Let's see 'em.

2631
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,611
>> Got 'em, y'all.

2632
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:33,612
>> We got some sardines.

2633
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:34,613
>> Oh, yes!

2634
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:35,614
Thank you!

2635
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:36,782
>> All right!

2636
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,408
>> Thank you!

2637
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,202
>> It looks good!

2638
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:42,579
>> Ooh, I can smell 'em.

2639
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:43,580
>> Mmm.

2640
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,791
>> Oh, look at that.

2641
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,376
>> The Fang Tribe has protein,

2642
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:49,211
finally, after six days now,

2643
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,297
and it feels good.

2644
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,555
>> Oh, it's Dan coming back.

2645
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:00,847
>> Oh, good.

2646
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:01,682
>> All right.

2647
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:02,683
>> Man's back.

2648
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:05,185
>> All right!

2649
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:05,769
Come on back.

2650
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:08,480
>> It's a bad place.

2651
01:16:08,563 --> 01:16:09,481
>> Welcome back.

2652
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:10,899
>> No, but it was not-not fun at

2653
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:11,733
all.

2654
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:12,150
Thank you so much.

2655
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:12,693
>> How was it?

2656
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:13,777
>> Did you have fire?

2657
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,820
>> Did you have any food?

2658
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,405
>> I can't really talk about it.

2659
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:16,947
>> Oh. Why, it was so bad?

2660
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,490
(mumbling)

2661
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:19,783
>> No. I mean, there was a

2662
01:16:19,866 --> 01:16:20,617
good...

2663
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:21,910
I just made the bad choice.

2664
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:22,661
>> What?

2665
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:23,704
>> There's, like, a choice when

2666
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:24,037
you get there.

2667
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,497
>> Oh.

2668
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,790
>> If we have to send one of

2669
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:28,083
their tribe members, we need to

2670
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:28,750
think about it.

2671
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:29,001
>> Yeah.

2672
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,794
>> You send a weak player, they

2673
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:31,795
may just quit right there.

2674
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:32,004
>> Yeah.

2675
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,505
>> Yeah.

2676
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:34,506
>> I think a weak player...

2677
01:16:34,589 --> 01:16:35,465
>> You send a strong player,

2678
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,717
they may find the idol and be

2679
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,050
even stronger.

2680
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,510
>> True. Plus, a stronger

2681
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,428
player...

2682
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:40,679
>> But I don't know if anyone is

2683
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:41,680
going to find that thing.

2684
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:42,806
I looked, like, five or six

2685
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:43,015
hours.

2686
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:43,765
>> I figured. I said, "I bet

2687
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,851
Dan's is gonna be going all over

2688
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:46,852
the place looking for that."

2689
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:47,269
>> Couldn't find it.

2690
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:47,686
I was going berserk.

2691
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,729
>> Dan's back from Exile Island,

2692
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:51,940
and, uh, he was acting real

2693
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:52,649
strange, man.

2694
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,901
Like, I just don't get this guy.

2695
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,737
>> Oh, man, it really makes you

2696
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:57,904
rethink, like, your reasons for

2697
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:58,905
doing this.

2698
01:16:58,989 --> 01:16:59,906
(laughter)

2699
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:00,991
>> I'm guessing that he-he

2700
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:03,744
either knows where it is, or Dan

2701
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:05,329
has the immunity idol right now.

2702
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:06,330
>> Yeah, something's fishy with

2703
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:07,331
Dan, for sure.

2704
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:08,373
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.

2705
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,374
>> Fishy.

2706
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,834
He either ate, or he's got the

2707
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:11,877
idol.

2708
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,086
>> I think Dan is cool.

2709
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,254
>> Something's up, dude.

2710
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,547
>> If Dan has the immunity idol

2711
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,798
right now, it affects my game

2712
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,217
because he will hold the power

2713
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,218
of the tribe.

2714
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:20,844
>> The two people on the block

2715
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:22,721
right now is Dan or Gillian.

2716
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:22,971
>> Yeah.

2717
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,556
>> Yeah.

2718
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:25,307
>> Okay.

2719
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,141
>> Like-Like 100%...

2720
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:27,184
>> We cannot trust Dan 100%.

2721
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:28,185
>> 50-50.

2722
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:29,102
>> 100%.

2723
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:30,103
>> 50...

2724
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,774
>> Yeah.

2725
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:34,900
>> He's definitely got the idol,

2726
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:35,942
dude.

2727
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:36,818
He's acting too weird.

2728
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:37,819
>> (laughing): No...

2729
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:38,820
>> He's too comfortable.

2730
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:39,863
>> He's not tripping out like

2731
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:40,072
normal.

2732
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,199
>> I think he's just paranoid.

2733
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:43,241
I think he's just really,

2734
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,618
really tired and had a tough

2735
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:45,577
night.

2736
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,370
I really do.

2737
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:46,995
>> You don't think he's got it,

2738
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:47,704
dude, you really don't?

2739
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,498
>> I really don't.

2740
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:50,415
>> He's coming back.

2741
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,416
>> He's a smart person.

2742
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,459
I think he has it.

2743
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:55,545
>> He's coming back.

2744
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,386
>> Isn't the plan, according to

2745
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:03,428
everybody, Gillian?

2746
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:04,429
>> What?

2747
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:05,013
No. Right now, the way things

2748
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,183
seems is, it could be Dan.

2749
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:10,227
>> I'd rather have Gillian go.

2750
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:11,520
>> If you guys decide Dan goes

2751
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:12,104
first, I'm definitely going

2752
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:12,896
with you.

2753
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:15,023
>> We got to weigh our options,

2754
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:15,816
too.

2755
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:17,442
My whole thing is, Dan is smart,

2756
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,236
and I think that Dan is going to

2757
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:20,237
try to...

2758
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,238
>> He's not smart enough.

2759
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,239
>> He's a lawyer.

2760
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:22,864
It takes a person with a certain

2761
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:23,865
swagger to be a lawyer.

2762
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,284
Not everybody is cut out to

2763
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,578
be lawyers.

2764
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,835
(snorts)

2765
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:52,394
>> PROBST: Catch me up on what's

2766
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:54,396
happened in the last few days.

2767
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:55,647
Last time I saw you, you

2768
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:57,023
decided we need a leader.

2769
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:57,774
GC's going to be the leader.

2770
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:00,652
How's it going being the leader?

2771
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:03,363
>> Well, uh, it was...

2772
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:04,573
>> It<i> was?</i>

2773
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:05,907
>> It was going all right for a

2774
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,742
day or two, but my group kind of

2775
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,077
volunteered me to be the leader,

2776
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,620
and that's not a position that I

2777
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:12,289
want to be in in this game with

2778
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,165
this tribe.

2779
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:14,666
And I told them, you know, I

2780
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,959
don't want to be the leader of

2781
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:16,209
the group.

2782
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:16,918
>> PROBST: Susie, what happened?

2783
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:19,129
>> There was a little conflict

2784
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:20,338
between Gillian, I think.

2785
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:20,881
She just wanted to voice her

2786
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:21,923
opinion about something, and GC

2787
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,967
felt like he was being attacked.

2788
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,010
So, that's kind of what

2789
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:25,260
happened.

2790
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,053
It kind of just fell apart.

2791
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:27,888
>> And it definitely doesn't

2792
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:28,930
mean I'm not helping out.

2793
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,223
It doesn't mean I'm not giving

2794
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,016
my opinion.

2795
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,100
It doesn't mean we're not

2796
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:33,101
working together as a group.

2797
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,644
It just means that I'm not the

2798
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:35,937
one that everybody is looking to

2799
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,272
for some kind of guidance, which

2800
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:39,065
some people just really don't

2801
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,400
need anyway.

2802
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,485
>> PROBST: Randy, what's the

2803
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:42,736
problem right now with the

2804
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:43,653
tribe?

2805
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:44,905
>> We've got eight individuals.

2806
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:45,822
Period.

2807
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,407
I see where GC is coming from.

2808
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:48,742
I wouldn't want to lead this

2809
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:49,075
bunch, either.

2810
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:50,911
>> PROBST: Dan, is the problem

2811
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:52,370
that there's just too many

2812
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,372
disruptive forces?

2813
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,373
I'm up; you're down?

2814
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:56,666
I'm left; you're right?

2815
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,167
>> I think it's lack of

2816
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,001
leadership.

2817
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,462
And I can understand that you

2818
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:01,838
don't want to be voted off<i> for</i>

2819
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:02,839
standing up.

2820
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:03,924
I mean, you just kind of made a

2821
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:05,842
face and shook your head when I

2822
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:06,885
said that, but that's no

2823
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,011
different than what Randy just

2824
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:08,970
said.

2825
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,014
>> And I was, like, "If you

2826
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:12,307
really feel like we need a

2827
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,433
leader, how about somebody else

2828
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,726
step in, wants to be that

2829
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:15,519
person?"

2830
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,979
And what did everybody do?

2831
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:20,232
>> PROBST: Crystal, are you

2832
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:21,358
frustrated that you don't have

2833
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:22,192
a leader?

2834
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:23,735
>> It can be a little bit

2835
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:25,028
frustrating, but sometimes, our

2836
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:26,279
day-to-day chores at the house,

2837
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:27,322
we don't need a leader.

2838
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:27,906
If we see the wood is going

2839
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,908
low, somebody is going to get

2840
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:30,075
up.

2841
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,327
But when it's time to go to

2842
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:32,953
war, Jeff, I'm all about in the

2843
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:33,870
zone.

2844
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:36,122
I need to hear about how we're

2845
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,374
going to get our heads together

2846
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:38,583
and how we're going to kick

2847
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,417
Kota's butt.

2848
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:40,418
>> I agree there.

2849
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,711
It's the strategies and the

2850
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,088
discipline and the challenges

2851
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,131
that we need to pull together

2852
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:45,966
on, and we all need to agree.

2853
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:49,803
Otherwise, we're doomed.

2854
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:50,387
>> PROBST: GC, tell me about

2855
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:51,012
camp life.

2856
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,097
Has it gotten any better?

2857
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,182
>> It got a little bit better,

2858
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,142
man, 'cause, uh, the homie Randy

2859
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:57,602
right here made us a fishing

2860
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:58,562
hook.

2861
01:20:58,645 --> 01:20:59,854
Crystal and Sue, and I think

2862
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:01,022
Gill even, were out getting

2863
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:01,898
worms this morning.

2864
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,441
And me and Kenny hopped on the

2865
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:04,776
boat, and we caught, like, five

2866
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:05,360
fish.

2867
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:06,653
They were small, but, hey, it

2868
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:07,696
helped out a lot.

2869
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:09,239
It made us feel a lot better.

2870
01:21:09,322 --> 01:21:10,615
>> PROBST: Dan, tell me about

2871
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:11,658
Exile Island.

2872
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:13,743
>> It's a... It's a tough place.

2873
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:14,369
I mean, it's a good opportunity,

2874
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:16,037
but it can really mess with your

2875
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,081
mind a little bit.

2876
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:19,791
Searching for that idol comes

2877
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,001
with its price because you

2878
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:22,377
could spend all day looking for

2879
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,920
the idol and not find it.

2880
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,214
So, it can play that trick on

2881
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,507
you a little bit, being out

2882
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:28,550
there.

2883
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:29,801
>> PROBST: Matt, are you at all

2884
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:31,052
concerned over whether Dan may

2885
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,554
have found the hidden immunity

2886
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:33,805
idol already?

2887
01:21:33,888 --> 01:21:34,806
>> Yeah, there's a little

2888
01:21:34,889 --> 01:21:35,140
concern.

2889
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,933
>> PROBST: Crystal, did you guys

2890
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:37,934
talk about it?

2891
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,686
>> You know we did!

2892
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:40,145
(laughter)

2893
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:43,356
Okay, it's bound to happen.

2894
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,567
Yes, we talked, and I think Dan

2895
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,652
is a very smart gentleman.

2896
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,154
And I think you got the idol.

2897
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:50,155
(laughing): That's just my

2898
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:50,989
thing.

2899
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:52,073
I think you found it.

2900
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,575
But, you know, as limited... as

2901
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:54,576
limited clues...

2902
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:55,118
>> I don't see any idol in

2903
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:56,036
there, sister.

2904
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:57,829
>> It's fine.

2905
01:21:57,912 --> 01:21:58,705
It's limited clues.

2906
01:21:58,788 --> 01:21:59,539
>> I-I don't lie.

2907
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:00,582
I just don't lie.

2908
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:01,750
>> I don't discount anyone or

2909
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:04,210
anytng in this gam

2910
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:05,712
>> I don't have the idol.

2911
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:06,713
I wish I did.

2912
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,131
So don't try and flush it out,

2913
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:09,132
please!

2914
01:22:09,215 --> 01:22:13,011
I don't want to go home.

2915
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,012
>> PROBST: All right.

2916
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,055
It is time to vote.

2917
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:18,183
Dan, you're up.

2918
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,734
>> You're a sweet woman, but

2919
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:28,276
I think this is where the

2920
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,069
group's going.

2921
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:32,155
For all I know, it could be me.

2922
01:22:53,259 --> 01:22:55,470
>> My vote tonight is for Kenny.

2923
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:57,180
He just doesn't get a clue a lot

2924
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:58,181
of the time.

2925
01:22:58,264 --> 01:23:01,393
So, good luck, Kenny.

2926
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,531
>> Sorry.

2927
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:18,618
I wish it wasn't you, but it is.

2928
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:24,874
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

2929
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,961
votes.

2930
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,556
>> PROBST: If anybody has the

2931
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:40,598
hidden immunity idol, and you

2932
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:41,182
want to play it, now would be

2933
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:45,687
the time to do so.

2934
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:47,230
Okay, once the votes are read,

2935
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:48,231
the decision is final.

2936
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:49,524
The person voted out will be

2937
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:50,608
asked to leave the Tribal

2938
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,735
Council area immediately.

2939
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:55,155
I'll read the votes.

2940
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:59,617
>> First vote: Gillian.

2941
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:02,203
Kenny.

2942
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:03,246
One vote Gillian;

2943
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:06,207
one vote Kenny.

2944
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,459
Gillian.

2945
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:12,297
Two votes Gillian; one vote Ken.

2946
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:13,506
Gillian.

2947
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,632
That's three votes Gillian;

2948
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:18,678
one vote Ken.

2949
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,054
Gillian.

2950
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:20,597
That's four votes Gillian;

2951
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:24,309
one vote Ken.

2952
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,019
Second person voted out of

<i>Survivor: Gabon:</i> Gillian.

2954
01:24:26,686 --> 01:24:27,270
That's five.

2955
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:28,271
That's enough.

2956
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:31,357
You need to bring me your torch.

2957
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:41,743
Gillian, the tribe has spoken.

2958
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,788
>> Bummer.

2959
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,581
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.

2960
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:47,707
>> Bye, guys.

2961
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,794
Good luck.

2962
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,135
>> PROBST: Well, the best news

2963
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,012
to come out of tonight's Tribal

2964
01:25:01,095 --> 01:25:03,014
Council is that you realize that

2965
01:25:03,097 --> 01:25:04,349
when you work together, you are

2966
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,266
successful.

2967
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,811
Now, you just need to do it a

2968
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:08,937
little more often.

2969
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:09,771
Grab your torches.

2970
01:25:09,854 --> 01:25:10,313
Head back to camp.

2971
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,398
Good night.

2972
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:29,499
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

2973
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:30,458
from our next episode.

2974
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:33,253
>> PROBST: Next time on

2975
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:35,004
<i>Survivor:</i>

2976
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,005
>> Randy, are you, like, the

2977
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:36,923
leader of the tribe now?

2978
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,091
>> PROBST: Fang is a tribe with

2979
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:38,883
big problems.

2980
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:39,801
>> No. We decided this tribe

2981
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:40,552
doesn't need a leader.

2982
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:41,344
Drop it.

2983
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:42,220
>> I don't have to drop

2984
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:42,554
nothing, man.

2985
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:43,221
I can ask you something if I

2986
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:44,973
want.

2987
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:45,765
>> PROBST: They've lost three

2988
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:46,683
challenges in a row.

2989
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:48,143
Now they're in for the fight of

2990
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,602
their lives in order to stay in

2991
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:50,645
the game.

2992
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:52,981
>> Let go...!

2993
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:57,694
>> There's a huge part of me

2994
01:25:57,777 --> 01:25:59,904
that would have wished that I

2995
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:00,947
could have won<i> Survivor: Africa</i>

2996
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:03,074
because I'm still not done with

2997
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:04,158
wanting to play it.

2998
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:05,243
Guess it doesn't work to speak

2999
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:06,536
your mind when you know you

3000
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:07,495
really shouldn't.

3001
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:08,538
I should have just continued

3002
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:09,873
flying low under the radar, and

3003
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:10,623
I didn't.

3004
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:11,332
It has been an absolutely

3005
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,375
fantastic experience, and I wish

3006
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:14,419
the tribe good luck because I

3007
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:17,338
think they're going to need it.
