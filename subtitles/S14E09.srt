00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,462
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,880
Yau-Man discovered the Immunity

4
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,799
Idol hidden at Moto...

5
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,342
>> This is my million dollars.

6
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:09,551
Mwah!

7
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,927
>> PROBST: ...and he immediately

8
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,178
informed Earl.

9
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,723
>> I would have never thought

10
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,349
that a big, strong black man

11
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,184
would become one of my best

12
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,436
allies.

13
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,062
>> PROBST: At Ravu, Mookie, Alex

14
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,606
and Edgardo found the idol

15
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,234
hidden at their camp.

16
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,777
They made a pact not to tell

17
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,194
Lisi or Dreamz.

18
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,447
>> Dreamz is not so good about

19
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,239
keeping his trap shut, so we're

20
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,324
doing it for his protection and

21
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:33,950
our own.

22
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,576
>> PROBST: Lisi had no idea that

23
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,828
the idol had been found.

24
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,370
>> A little idol digging?

25
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,038
I'm, like, "Dude, you're gonna

26
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,206
have to wake up really, really

27
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,750
early to fool an old cat like

28
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,417
me.

29
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,668
What's wrong with you?"

30
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,419
>> PROBST: At the Reward

31
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,463
Challenge, the Survivors squared

32
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,673
off in a dance competition...

33
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,507
>> Okay!

34
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,717
>> PROBST: ...and Earl led Moto

35
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,885
to victory.

36
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,135
>> Moto.

37
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,597
(cheering, shouting)

38
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,514
>> All right, then.

39
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,515
>> PROBST: Lisi was banished to

40
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,184
Exile Island, where she broke

41
00:00:59,267 --> 00:00:59,392
down.

42
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,226
>> I really don't want to be

43
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,103
here, but what am I supposed to

44
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,104
do, man?

45
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,273
(thunder crashing)

46
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,108
I feel like quitting.

47
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,318
>> PROBST: At the Immunity

48
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,277
Challenge...

49
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,404
(cheering)

50
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,782
...Yau-Man dominated for Moto.

51
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,825
Moto wins immunity!

52
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,953
>> Flex my muscle!

53
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:19,537
>> PROBST: With another Tribal

54
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,581
Council looming, it looked like

55
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,124
Ravu's decision was clear.

56
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,167
>> I don't see you guys winning

57
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,002
the next Reward Challenge, and

58
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:26,628
that means I get to go to Exile

59
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,253
Island again.

60
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,213
>> PROBST: When Lisi threw in

61
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,923
the towel...

62
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,341
>> I'm done like a Thanksgiving

63
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,009
Day turkey, man.

64
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:33,760
(clucks like a turkey)

65
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,344
>> The fact that Lisi wants to

66
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,638
quit pissed me off, because I

67
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,889
could probably use her in the

68
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,640
future.

69
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,516
>> PROBST: But Lisi had second

70
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,308
thoughts...

71
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,976
>> What would happen if... we

72
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,310
kept on going?

73
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,062
>> PROBST: ...which threw

74
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:49,234
Edgardo and Alex for a loop.

75
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,152
At Tribal Council...

76
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:51,694
>> I think Lisi wants to go

77
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,904
home.

78
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:53,822
>> PROBST: ...Dreamz called Lisi

79
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,239
out.

80
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,532
>> Do you want to be here?

81
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,407
>> Okay...

82
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,450
>> It's a yes or no question,

83
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:57,867
Lisi.

84
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,493
>> Well, I have to think for a

85
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,160
minute, I have to just chill...

86
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,454
>> Jeff, I'm ready to vote.

87
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,163
>> PROBST: In the end, Lisi's

88
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,707
indecisiveness got her

89
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,459
unanimously voted off.

90
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,379
Lisi, the tribe has spoken.

91
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,839
Ten are left.

92
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:15,009
Who will be voted out tonight?

93
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,402
(sizzling)

94
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,236
>> Do you have the idol now

95
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:33,486
with you?

96
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,365
Hey, put it here, man.

97
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,950
Are you sure?

98
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:39,951
>> Yeah.

99
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:40,535
>> And if you use it against

100
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,244
me, I'm gonna ... you over,

101
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,787
man.

102
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,037
>> Okay.

103
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:43,663
The idol I have in my pocket is

104
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,542
actually for...

105
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,793
You know, I'm selfish.

106
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,419
I'll admit it in this game.

107
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,629
It's for myself, to get myself

108
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,298
further along in this game.

109
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,799
Now, if that plays into my

110
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,426
alliance with these guys, to use

111
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,261
these guys to get further, then

112
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,888
I'll, you know, I'm all for it.

113
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,930
>> We're placing our faith in

114
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,726
you, man.

115
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,606
Okay, fair enough.

116
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,277
>> Dreamz, hey, man.

117
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,447
>> Edgardo, Mookie and myself

118
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,823
have not told Dreamz about the

119
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,866
Immunity Idol.

120
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,450
Not because we want to keep it

121
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,494
from him so that we can use it

122
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,121
against him, but really, it's

123
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,539
just because we don't think

124
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,707
Dreamz is good about keeping

125
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,877
information to himself.

126
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,757
>> Not bad at all.

127
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:38,885
>> I know, but one at a time,

128
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,346
you know?

129
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,199
>> Tree Mail!

130
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,661
>> It's not a good Tree Mail.

131
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,912
>> Uh-oh.

132
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,996
>> "Gather your personal

133
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,540
belongings only, and use the map

134
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,333
to paddle your tribe boat to

135
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,544
Exile Island immediately.

136
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,254
You are not allowed to bring

137
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,465
rewards, tools or flints.

138
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,383
Bring only your personal items,

139
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,802
including your canteen."

140
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,761
>> We need to boil up the rest

141
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,012
of that rice.

142
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,097
>> Boil it up, boil it up.

143
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,430
>> Boil it up.

144
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:24,931
>> Boil it up.

145
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,182
>> Are we living on Exile

146
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,684
Island for the rest of the time?

147
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,309
We got Tree Mail, and we're

148
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,979
like, "Oh, man, we're leaving

149
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:31,604
our camp."

150
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,024
You know, this sucks.

151
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:35,566
>> Nope.

152
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,818
>> The fact that I've been

153
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,443
through, you know, the old Ravu

154
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,989
situation, I know I can sleep

155
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,116
in the dirt and not eat a lot

156
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,534
of food for a while.

157
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,493
Me and Earl actually exchanged

158
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,620
places, and we were like, "This

159
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,413
is great.

160
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,914
We can totally do this."

161
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,541
Cassandra, Stacy and Boo have

162
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,458
been living the whole time on

163
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,836
Honeymoon Fiji here, and they're

164
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,295
like, "Oh, my God, we're gonna

165
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,507
die."

166
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,094
>> Gather round, horsemen.

167
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,303
Let's see what we've got.

168
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,304
>> Is this mail?

169
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,390
>> Is this mail?

170
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,891
>> This is a map.

171
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,351
>> It's a map.

172
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,686
>> Oh!

173
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,729
>> "Gather your personal

174

including your canteens."

181
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,952
>> Sounds like we're about to

182
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,037
mix and match again.

183
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,288
>> No, we... we all go to Exile

184
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:30,580
Island.

185
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,539
That's where we stay now.

186
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,624
We all merge at Exile Island.

187
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,084
What do you think about that?

188
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:35,710
>> We're ready.

189
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,836
>> I think we're merging.

190
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,838
>> All right, guys, um, so, all

191
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,423

195
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,968
The game takes so many twists.

196
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,511
I'm hoping for a merge, but if

197
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,596
it's not, I mean, it's part of

198
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,848
the game.

199
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,474

200
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,391
clear on who we're targeting.

201
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,352
We're targeting Cassandra.

202
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,354

203
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,191
>> You're Michelle?

204
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,442
Let's target Stacy.

205
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,777
>> So the master plan is

206
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,444
basically, if we merge, Dreamz

207
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,155
tries to pull Cassandra over,

208
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,865
giving us five-five, Mookie

209
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,325
tries to pull Michelle or

210
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,160
Yau-Man, and I think I can pull

211
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:09,952
Stacy.

215
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,455
here.

216
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,623

>> And the bottom line is, each

219
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,460
of us has proven our loyalty to

220
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,087
the other by essentially giving

221
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,712
up someone we were aligned with

222
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,422

225
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,467
We gave up Lisi.

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,427
Right now, we have to get nasty,

227
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,595

were going to live there and

286
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,306
least we came from Ravu, where

287
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,182

rice, potatoes, a toothbrush,

343
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,788
toothpaste, a shower, and I

344
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,790
smell like crap, I know.

345
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,166

00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,606
and behold, nothing.

382
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,108
I mean nothing.

383
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,902
We got a little bit of fishing

384
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,987
gear, a couple of pots, a

385
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,781
machete, a flint, and that's it.

386
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,576
>> I've never seen Moto.

387
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,952
>> You never did get to see

388
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,036
Moto, did you?

389
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,580
>> Never got a bed.

390
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,038
I never a toothbrush.

391
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,915
I never got anything.

392
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,800
>> Everything was gone.

393
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,011
No bed, no couch, no shelter,

394
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,514
no bathroom, no nothing.

395
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:45,973
I felt okay with that.

396
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,016
I kind of laughed.

397
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,602
Had a little smirk on my face

398
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,978
because I've already been

399
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,188
trained.

400
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,731
You know, being at the old Ravu

401
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,941
for 13 days-- hey, I'm just back

402
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,527
home again.

403
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,570
>> Everybody has the same way

404
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,571
now, so.

405
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,197
>> Good.

406
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,655
>> All right, well...

407
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,239
>> Everybody gather around for

408
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:02,823
the mail.

409
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,825
All right.

410
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,495
"Now it is time to reveal your

411
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,662
world from scratch.

412
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,872
Give yourself a new name, paint

413
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,874
your new flag, and start the

414
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,083
game anew."

415
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:13,918
>> That's it?

416
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:14,919
>> Yeah, that's it.

417
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,587
>> Let's do it.

418
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,213
>> All right.

419
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,255
>> Okay, what's the name, guys?

420
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,298
>> Something that has to do

421
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,341
with the islands or something

422
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,342
I don't know.

423
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,551
>> Venaca.

424
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,928
>> Isn't Venaca "thank you"?

425
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:24,929
>> Thank you.

426
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:25,971
>> And "Bula" is hello.

427
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,014
>> Let's do Bula.

428
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:27,348
>> Bula-Bula.

429
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,016
>> I... I vote for that.

430
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,017
>> Bula-Bula.

431
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,060
>> Bula-Bula it is.

432
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,061
>> Bula-Bula.

433
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,479
>> Either that, either that or

434
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,272
the nooky-nooky tribe.

435
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,273
>> Bula-nooky.

436
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,274
>> Bula-looky-nooky.

437
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,275
>> Hello.

438
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,568
>> So who's good, who's good at

439
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,569
drawing?

440
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,571
>> Me and Stacy?

441
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,865
>> We decided on Bula-Bula as

442
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,660
the tribe name because "Bula"

443
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,538
is how you say "hello" in Fiji.

444
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,000
>> On the flag itself or on

445
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,001
what-what's going on here?

446
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,002
>> The flag.

447
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,003
>> No, I wanted to look at our

448
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,005
canvas.

449
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,007
We can never be so sure in this

450
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,050
game, you know.

451
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,051
>> I know.

452
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,887
>> We want to be in a safe spot.

453
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,889
I think we are now, don't you?

454
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,099
>> Yeah, yeah.

455
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,892
I'm a little worried because you

456
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,310
guys are all still super close.

457
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,353
>> Yeah, but the thing is,

458
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,646
Michelle, is that I don't that

459
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,689
think that we're a threat

460
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,273
because we're girls, and those

461
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,149
guys are going to get super

462
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,776
competitive.

463
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:21,402
It's interesting, I think boys

464
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,027
are going to start attacking

465
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,613
boys and getting them off game

466
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,823
before they're going to touch

467
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,448
the girls, because they look at

468
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,116
us as non-threats.

469
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,702
So we'll be, like, the last to

470
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,703
go.

471
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,996
I mean that's how it's lined up

472
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,997
for now.

473
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,624
We're in a pretty good spot.

474
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,834
>> Now I'm like-- now I'm

475
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,876
thinking like the other island

476
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,877
is better.

477
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,461
>> As far as fishing, yeah.

478
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,004
>> Because we could get more

479
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:40,963
food.

480
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:41,964
>> Like crabs.

481
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,007
We're a new tribe now.

482
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,426
But there-there's a core group.

483
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,760
There's a tribe within the tribe

484
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,554
and the tribe within the tribe

485
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,931
is myself, Michelle, Cassandra,

486
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,558
and Yau.

487
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,726
Now it's just divide and

488
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,727
conquer.

489
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,020
We have to kind of divide up

490
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,855
that old Moto and get them one

491
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,440
by one and knock them out.

492
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,442
>> What do you all want to do?

493
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,277
>> Yeah, let's divide everything

494
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,279
up and just get-get going.

495
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,073
So the moment has final arrived.

496
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,116
These first couple of hours are

497
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,493
really crucial.

498
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,578
They're going to determine who's

499
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,163
the final five.

500
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,956
I'm ready to fight.

501
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,249
>> All right, so who's going to

502
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,250
go fishing?

503
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,001
>> I can go.

504
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:19,918
>> I'll go.

505
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:20,461
>> Let's go us four, then.

506
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,754
>> There are two slings.

507
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,379
Two people can be crabbing while

508
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,089
another couple of people can sit

509
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,674
on the boat and try to fish.

510
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,468
>> I had my niche in the first

511
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,510
Moto tribe.

512
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,053
I had my niche in the second

513
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,096
Moto tribe and I was very

514
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,097
comfortable.

515
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,140
At this point, I'm not

516
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,558
comfortable at all, so I'm

517
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,184
going-going to take a backseat.

518
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,019
And that's all I can do is be a

519
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,813
good little helper, and then

520
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,732
when it's time, I'll assume

521
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,817
leadership role again.

522
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,781
>> How was camp over here?

523
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,573
>> It was good.

524
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,282
It was nice.

525
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,825
We had a good little, um, thing

526
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,826
going.

527
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,410
>> Me and Dreamz hooked up at

528
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,119
Ravu, so we got good.

529
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,120
>> I was hoping that.

530
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,914
I was hoping that.

531
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,539
>> Yeah, I mean we clicked and

532
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,500
then... he said, you and I saw--

533
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,042
I said, you know me and Yau,

534
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,044
like I trust Yau at Ravu.

535
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,671
>> And Earl and Michelle.

536
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,963
>> Am I still one who trusts

537
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,964
someone, Yau?

538
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:06,840
>> Yeah.

539
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,009
>> Or have I left?

540
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,552
>> No, I didn't go to the dark

541
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,136
side.

542
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,346
>> We were all afraid.

543
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,098
>> First second, we got onto

544
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,140
this island, four horsemen as

545
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,309
we discussed-- we were going to

546
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,852
go split up and figure out what

547
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,311
was happening at Moto.

548
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,980
And so we went straight to work,

549
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,565
and infiltrated that group and

550
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,651
kind of gained their trust.

551
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,945
>> Are you guys good with Boo?

552
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:28,529
Do you guys like him or...?

553
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,238
>> Oh, no.

554
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,864
I'm a...

555
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,865
>> He goes first.

556
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,491
>> We can't decide whether it's

557
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,033
Boo or Stacy.

558
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,828
Stacy because we don't want the

559
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,412
Alex connection, but now that

560
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,246
we merged...

561
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,247
Yeah.

562
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,040
>> And that's the thing, Boo

563
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,083
just stirs up too much...

564
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,126
>> He gets it going quick.

565
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,168
>> Yeah, he stirs too much.

566
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,712
You gotta get him out before he

567
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,504
starts, like...

568
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,505
>> Mm-hmm.

569
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,256
>> Right away, we found they

570
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,550
want Boo out, and then we take

571
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,551
out Stacy.

572
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,844
Right now, our plan is working

573
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,137
out perfectly as far as what we

574
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,138
know.

575
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,431
We just have to execute it

576
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,432
right.

577
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,433
>> So, Boo first?

578
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,434
>> Boo first.

579
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,103
And then Stacy or Alex.

580
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,815
>> Currently, I'm the only one

581
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,191
with the idol, and Earl is the

582
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,735
only one who knows I have the

583
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,736
idol.

584
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,112
Potentially, there should be two

585
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,155
immunity idols in play right now

586
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,197
in the game.

587
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,366
The question is who's got the

588
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,367
other one?

589
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,660
The next opportunity we have we

590
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,286
would like to vote out Boo, and

591
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,164
I think we have pretty much

592
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,750
secure Mookie's and Dreamz's

593
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,960
votes, but we don't trust nobody

594
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:27,045
here.

595
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
>> Oh, it's so cute!

596
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,634
>> There you go!

597
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,186
>> Yeah, he goes first.

598
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,188
For sure.

599
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,190
>> I really have a lot of trust

600
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,524
in Alex, because we're both

601
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,067
original Moto, and that's just,

602
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,110
you know, the chance that I'm

603
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,111
taking.

604
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,154
But he's the most trustworthy

605
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,697
person that I can think of right

606
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,740
now.

607
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,365
>> I mean, I think we should do

608
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,325
what's most convenient for us.

609
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,744
You know, me, you, and Ed are

610
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,037
tighter-- are going to be

611
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,662
tighter together than whoever

612
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,247
it is that's around.

613
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,459
>> And then we-we also are more

614
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,752
solid, too, on a vote.

615
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,795
>> Yeah, we're more solid...

616
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,797
>> Against two.

617
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,380
>> I can use the relationships

618
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,341
I've had to sort of create smoke

619
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,885
and mirrors, to keep them sort

620
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:15,511
of guessing, so that, you know,

621
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,346
the four horsemen can take it

622
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,347
all the way.

623
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,640
Unless I'm mistaken, the four of

624
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,682
us are controlling this game

625
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,683
right now.

626
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,267
I could be wrong, and I could

627
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,520
be getting set up, but this is

628
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,521
my best bet.

629
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,522
What can I do?

630
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,523
I know you're smart.

631
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,607
I'm not worried about you.

632
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,191
I just wanted you have all the

633
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,150
information I have.

634
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,236
>> No, I appreciate it.

635
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,328
>> We all want Boo off.

636
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,621
>> Yeah, so Boo's going to go

637
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,622
off first.

638
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,915
>> And then we're going to get

639
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:45,332
Stacy off second.

640
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,292
>> The thing is-- yeah...

641
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,295
>> Okay.

642
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,926
>> All of a sudden, Mookie let

643
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,512
Dreamz know that we had the

644
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,930
idol, and as soon as that

645
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,307
happened, my gut was like, "Ooh,

646
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,350
that was not so smart."

647
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,394
But you can't say a ... word.

648
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,478
>> You can't say...

649
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,771
>> Do I look like...? Shut up.

650
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,814
>> No, no, no, no, just...

651
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,857
>> I'm not... no, I'm not...

652
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,858
>> Don't tell, don't tell

653
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,859
Cassandra.

654
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,860
>> When Alex and Mookie told me

655
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:13,861
that they had the immunity idol,

656
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,444
I was kind of mad because they

657
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,404
didn't tell me when they first

658
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,948
found it.

659
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:18,490
>> Just a few days ago.

660
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,825
>> Why didn't y'all tell me?

661
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,826
>> 'Cause we didn't...

662
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,827
>> Only because of Cassandra,

663
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,244
just to make sure.

664
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,038
But we were going to tell you.

665
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,540
>> We had a pact, and they kind

666
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,083
of made me not trust them a

667
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,459
little bit and-and made me feel

668
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,752
that I was on the outskirts.

669
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,170
So, point-blank, I'm going to

670
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,213
trust them until I can't trust

671
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,214
them no more.

672
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,215
Strange.

673
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,258
No, I wouldn't have said

674
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,134
anything.

675
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,427
I'm glad you all told me now

676
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,720
because I was getting kind of

677
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,345
scared.

678
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,638
I-I was getting kind of scared

679
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,222
about...

680
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,432
>> ...now it works perfect.

681
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,266
>> Now is everything's perfect.

682
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,267
Let's do it, y'all.

683
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,436
Don't screw up.

684
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,521
No more talk.

685
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,070
>> Dreamz knows about the

686
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,322
immunity idol, by the way.

687
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,948
>> Who told him?

688
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,325
>> Mookie wanted to tell him.

689
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,367
>> You told Dreamz about the

690
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,785
idol, man?

691
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,786
>> Why?

692
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,079
>> All right, I'm going to tell

693
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,372
you right now, I don't like that

694
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:07,581
plan.

695
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,248
Like not-not that I don't trust

696
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,042
you, but trusting all these

697
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:10,792
people...

698
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,835
>> No, no, either way, we're

699
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,836
taking out Boo first.

700
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,837
That's-that's everyone's

701
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:14,838
consensus.

702
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,881
>> I'm pissed off about the

703
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:16,882
whole situation right now.

704
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,925
We found the immunity idol.

705
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:18,508
It's something that, you know,

706
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,385
you need to keep between three

707
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,304
or two people to make it work.

708
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,931
That's all the people that

709
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,514
needed to be told, and Mookie

710
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,725
just told Dreamz out of nowhere.

711
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,352
And now I feel really

712
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:28,936
uncomfortable because Dreamz

713
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,021
has the... knows about the idol;

714
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:31,647
Cassandra knows about the idol;

715
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,274
Earl knows about the idol.

716
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,443
>> Do you get what I'm saying?

717
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,362
>> Maybe-- I mean, I don't know

718
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,446
how you feel about this, but we

719
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,781
should maybe just take Boo out

720
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,240
first, and then at that point

721
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:42,741
Stacy has nowhere to go.

722
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,409
And I trust Stacy.

723
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,452
She's not gonna, she's not

724
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,995
gonna...

725
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,456
So we could pull her in.

726
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:49,748
That's five.

727
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,126
That's a five-four majority.

728
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,627
That's the simplest way.

729
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,339
Stacy will be loyal, and we

730
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:57,881
don't really have to worry

731
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,217
about her winning the final

732
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,636
immunity, I don't think.

733
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,679
And we can put whatever order

734
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:03,929
you want.

735
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,348
I don't care.

736
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,101
>> I mean, that's fine.

737
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:15,649
The original plan was to

738
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,276
actually take out Boo and then

739
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,485
Stacy.

740
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,404
Things changed.

741
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,780
Alex and Edgardo want to bring

742
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:21,989
Stacy.

743
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,658
Now, bringing on Stacy is only

744
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,868
in their best interest, because

745
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,494
they still have the

746
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,495
relationship from the old Moto.

747
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,539
So when it gets down to five,

748
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,750
as we planned, Stacy is on

749
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,502
their side, and me and Dreamz,

750
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,753
you know, we're left out of the

751
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,256
loop.

752
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:39,840
>> If Dreamz tells somebody,

753
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,424
I'm going to kill you, Mookie,

754
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,386
man, seriously.

755
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,610
>> No one knows who has who.

756
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,361
>> Mm-hmm.

757
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,320
>> And that's great.

758
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:02,571
>> Mm-hmm.

759
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,782
(chuckles)

760
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,700
>> You're still the most

761
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,410
popular girl here right now.

762
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,454
You and Michelle, too, actually.

763
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:10,746
>> Uh-huh.

764
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,289
>> Michelle's getting pretty

765
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:12,956
popular.

766
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,041
>> Uh-huh.

767
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:14,583
>> And long as they just,

768
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,626
they don't pay any attention to

769
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,419
Dreamz still.

770
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,047
>> Mm-hmm.

771
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,298
>> I don't think, I still don't

772
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,674
trust Mookie.

773
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,842
>> Uh-huh.

774
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,719
My alliance is with some of the

775
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,096
people from Ravu side: Earl,

776
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,306
Yau-Man.

777
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,390
And then Earl has Michelle on

778
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,560
his side, and then definitely

779
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,311
Dreamz.

780
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,937
I was really hoping that he

781
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,355
would make it through to the

782
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:37,773
merge.

783
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,607
We've pretty much got the

784
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,108
numbers on our side.

785
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,194
>> Hey, just keep them thinking

786
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:42,611
that they have you.

787
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,821
Keep them thinking that I'm not

788
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,447
thinking.

789
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,573
>> Mm-hmm.

790
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,784
Yes, I'll definitely do that.

791
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,077
That's easy.

792
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,535
>> We'll just sail on.

793
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,788
I was actually happy about the

794
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,497
merge 'cause now the game is

795
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,040
really on.

796
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:55,624
It's time to take it to the

797
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,044
advanced level.

798
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,441
>> Let's see what's going on

799
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,651
there.

800
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,277
>> I'm like, do I bring my shoes

801
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,571
or do I run?

802
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,538
>> What?

803
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,497
>> Still Boo?

804
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,748
>> Boo, Stacy-- 'cause that's

805
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,499
two out of the way.

806
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,667
>> What they're saying now is

807
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,336
they want to keep Stacy on

808
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,963
board and use her the whole

809
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,881
time to have majority.

810
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:45,590
>> That's me and you out.

811
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,508
>> I know, I know, I know.

812
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,968
That's why I don't want to take

813
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:48,677
Stacy with us.

814
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,096
>> No way, no, point blank, no.

815
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:51,972
>> They just want Stacy on

816
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,181
their side to take one of us

817
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:53,348
off.

818
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,307
>> Take one of us off.

819
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,475
>> Because we said guaranteed

820
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:55,934
five.

821
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:56,476
>> Yeah.

822
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,018
>> Take one of us out, then

823
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,562
he's gonna take us out.

824
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,729
That will bring too much into

825
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,064
Alex's hands.

826
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:01,898
>> I ain't trusting nobody with

827
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:02,983
Stacy around, you know what I

828
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:03,191
mean?

829
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,401
'Cause they gonna always have

830
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,694
numbers with Stacy around.

831
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,738
That's why I said Stacy second.

832
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,156
Do you understand?

833
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,949
I was planning a long time ago.

834
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:11,533
I'm really looking forward to

835
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,660
voting off Stacy because she

836
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,829
treated me so bad when I was

837
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,997
with the old Moto.

838
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,039
She treated Cassandra so bad,

839
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,249
and all of a sudden she's happy

840
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,667
and nice and glad to see me all

841
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,668
of a sudden 'cause I got

842
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,295
friends and she ain't got the

843
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,004
power no more.

844
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,507
She's got to go.

845
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:43,440
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

846
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,942
I'll take that from you, Earl.

847
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,449
You guys ready to get to

848
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,283
today's challenge?

849
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,243
>> Yep.

850
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,040
>> PROBST: Draw a stone.

851
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,877
Do not look at it in your hand.

852
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,130
Separate bag for the ladies.

853
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,843
Keep it covered.

854
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,224
One left for you, Earl.

855
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,772
Everybody, put your hands out.

856
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,524
Everybody, reveal.

857
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,651
If you have orange, go to the

858
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,860
orange mat.

859
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,195
If you have green, go to the

860
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,947
green mat.

861
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,915
>> Another twist.

862
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:42,874
>> PROBST: Edgardo, you kind of

863
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,417
shrugged your shoulders.

864
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,001
>> I don't know what to expect

865
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,211
anymore.

866
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,671
I'm just like, well, you know,

867
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,380
bring it on.

868
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:48,880
Let's do it.

869
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,257
Let's do this right now.

870
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,049
>> PROBST: Boo, what do you

871
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,008
think's happening?

872
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:52,884
>> I think we've switched again.

873
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,348
>> PROBST: You have merged.

874
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,433
You are one tribe, but for

875
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,601
today's challenge, you will be

876
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,020
competing against each other.

877
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,897
You are two teams in this

878
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,940
challenge.

879
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,900
The green team will be Alex,

880
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,194
Michelle, Mookie, Stacy, and

881
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,153
Dreamz.

882
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,322
And the orange team: Edgardo,

883
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,284
Cassandra, Boo, Yau-Man and

884
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,410
Earl.

885
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,369
All right, should I tell you

886
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:19,828
about the challenge?

887
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,495
>> Yes, please.

888
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:20,996
>> Yes, please.

889
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,247
>> PROBST: On my go, you will be

890
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,665
shown a large Fijian mask and

891
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,126
given time to memorize the

892
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,961
symbols and their arrangement on

893
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,296
the mask.

894
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,338
You will then paddle in your

895
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,756
boat down the river to three

896
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,216
different stations.

897
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,509
Each time you come to a

898
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,760
station, you must retrieve a

899
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,972
bundle of puzzle pieces.

900
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,098
When you have all three

901
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:40,682
bundles, you'll paddle to the

902
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,725
finish.

903
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,977
Two tribe members from each

904
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,313
team will then use those pieces

905
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,149
to construct six of the symbols

906
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,027
that you saw on that mask.

907
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,694
You must then place the symbols

908
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,530
in the correct order on your

909
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,157
team mask.

910
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,658
First team to get it right wins.

911
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,368
Want to know what you're

912
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:00,827
playing for?

913
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,703
>> Yeah.

914
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,954
>> PROBST: Winning team wins

915
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,664
immunity.

916
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,791
The five people on that team

917
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,668
will not go to Tribal Council.

918
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,003
You will be safe from another

919
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:10,962
vote and guaranteed a

920
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,673
one-in-nine shot at a million

921
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,133
bucks.

922
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,677
In addition, the winning team

923
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,763
will feast.

924
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,390
Steak, skillet to cook it in,

925
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,976
some seasoning, vegetables,

926
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,811
couple bottles of wine.

927
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,729
Worth playing for?

928
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,606
>> Oh, yeah.

929
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,982
>> PROBST: For the losers,

930
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,568
nothing except this note and a

931
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,112
date with me at Tribal Council.

932
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:36,404
All right.

933
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:36,905
We'll get you guys in your

934
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,989
boats, we'll get started.

935
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,912
Here we go.

936
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,122
Reveal the mask.

937
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,166
The symbols you want to study

938
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:48,875
are the symbols in the turtle

939
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:53,171
shell at the top of the mask.

940
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,173
Whenever you're ready, take off.

941
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,008
This challenge has begun.

942
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,343
>> Ready.

943
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,260
>> PROBST: Green team thinks

944
00:27:59,344 --> 00:27:59,761

>> It went down like-- it went

1133
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,357
down like this... whoa!

1134
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,733
>> I can feel it going down.

1135
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,776
>> We're going to be running...

1136
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,819
we're going to be streaking

1137
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:08,027
naked.

1138
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,237
>> I don't want to cook because

1139
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,113
we have so little, if I mess it

1140
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,156
up, then I'll get beat up.

1141
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,032
>> That's what Boo does for a

1142
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,410
living, he cooks.

1143
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,537
>> That challenge saved my butt.

1144
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,830
If we hadn't been divided into

1145
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,665
teams, I would have been gone.

1146
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,124
There's no question.

1147
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,334
You know, I dodged a bullet.

1148
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,836
That's good.

1149
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,755
>> That meat looks glorious.

1150
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,257
>> And besides that, we all got

1151
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,051
steaks and sautéed vegetables.

1152
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,261
It was nice.

1153
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,347
It brought my spirits back up.

1154
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,186
>> Man, victory is sweet.

1155
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,230
>> I didn't want to go to

1156
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,648
Tribal Council, man.

1157
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,649
>> I know.

1158
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,109
>> Can't strategize, can't

1159
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,652
conspire...

1160
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,820
Straight from the challenge.

1161
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,863
>> Hey, wink at somebody.

1162
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:52,947
>> That's going to be hard.

1163
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,865
>> That's crazy.

1164
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,450
>> It might be something really

1165
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,367
crazy that happens, that

1166
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,410
somebody we didn't even think

1167
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,703
they would vote off would be

1168
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,871
gone.

1169
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:00,913
>> I'm a little bit worried

1170
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,372
about Alex right now.

1171
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,666
I hope he doesn't get voted out

1172
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,001
because if he gets voted out,

1173
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,461
all my plans will be like, all

1174
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,754
the strategies that I worked for

1175
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,337
the last 24 days will be gone.

1176
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,298
But, uh, Mookie has the idol

1177
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,176
right now, and maybe, you know,

1178
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,677
he can use the idol smartly.

1179
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,970
You know what pisses me off?

1180
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:17,263
The chance that we didn't get to

1181
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,681
say bye to the person.

1182
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,015
>> Yeah, man.

1183
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,475
>> That sucks that we can't do

1184
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:20,641
that.

1185
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,225
>> Who do you think they're

1186
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,935
going to vote out?

1187
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,103
>> I think it's a toss-up

1188
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,271
between Stacy and Michelle.

1189
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,689
>> I think it will be Stacy.

1190
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,941
>> It can be a surprise, though.

1191
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,193
If Michelle is gone, I'm

1192
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:30,818
definitely concerned about the

1193
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,319
future, 'cause she's a key

1194
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,905
component in my strategy.

1195
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,198
So I'm really keeping my fingers

1196
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,033
crossed that, uh, she's still

1197
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,493
alive.

1198
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,369
This is going to be a very, very

1199
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,204
interesting vote, 'cause you're

1200
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,789
going to get a lot of truth

1201
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:47,877
from people.

1202
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,350
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1203
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,312
the members of our jury.

1204
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,231
Rocky and Lisi voted out

1205
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:12,902
at the last Tribal Council.

1206
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,953
Dreamz, tell me about the merge.

1207
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,496
Was it exciting?

1208
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,747
Was it bad news?

1209
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,665
What was your reaction?

1210
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,249
>> I felt it was like day one

1211
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,376
all over again except this

1212
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,294
time people already know people.

1213
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,088
So it was all the same to me

1214
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:32,713
'cause I had friends from the

1215
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,882
old Moto and friends from the

1216
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,218
new Ravu, so I was pretty, I was

1217
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,678
pretty happy with that.

1218
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,720
>> PROBST: Alex, what was your

1219
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,013
reaction when you got to the

1220
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:41,556
beach and found out you were

1221
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,307
really going back to the

1222
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,559
original Moto?

1223
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,435
>> Kind of a "holy crap."

1224
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,228
I was shocked.

1225
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,771
I mean, when I got there, I

1226
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,940
was, like, "This is not good.

1227
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,316
This is not going to be fun."

1228
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,110
>> PROBST: Mookie, can you

1229
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,486
start to feel paranoia setting

1230
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,071
in already?

1231
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:57,697
>> Definitely feel the paranoia.

1232
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,282
I mean, people are developing

1233
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,158
different relationships, and

1234
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,201
you kind of lose yourself in

1235
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,494
it, and you don't know where

1236
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:03,911
you stand anymore.

1237
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,496
And definitely you feel the

1238
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,706
paranoia, especially on the

1239
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,707
hot seat again.

1240
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,000
>> PROBST: Why are you on the

1241
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:09,458
hot seat?

1242
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,085
>> I think everybody here is on

1243
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:11,878
the hot seat.

1244
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,503
We weren't able to talk to each

1245
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,796
other.

1246
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,464
And so now we're here not being

1247
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,215
able to devise a plan, not being

1248
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,259
able to talk to each other,

1249
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,552
understand where our stances are

1250
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,804
on who we think should go,

1251
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,599
and that makes me paranoid.

1252
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,142
>> PROBST: Stacy, so here you

1253
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,060
sit now, getting ready to vote

1254
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,228
somebody out with no idea what

1255
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,063
everybody else is thinking.

1256
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,107
How uncomfortable are you?

1257
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,108
>> Um, it's pretty

1258
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:34,734
uncomfortable.

1259
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,776
I think it's a toss-up.

1260
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,069
Right now my head is spinning

1261
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:37,653
a little bit because there's a

1262
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,405
group here and there's a group

1263
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,531
there and there's a group to the

1264
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,574
right and the left and behind

1265
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,783
you, and everybody is thinking

1266
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,493
about different scenarios and

1267
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,412
different alliances.

1268
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,622
>> PROBST: Dreamz, give me a

1269
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,915
reason to get rid of Stacy.

1270
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,207
>> One good reason for me to

1271
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,918
vote out Stacy is because it

1272
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:56,047
ain't me.

1273
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,631
>> PROBST: Michelle, give me a

1274
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,299
good reason to get rid of

1275
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,258
Dreamz.

1276
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,426
>> Me and Dreamz haven't really

1277
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,844
talked much about strategy, so

1278
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,846
I can't really say who he's in

1279
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,472
an alliance with.

1280
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,265
It's a fear of the unknown.

1281
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,350
>> PROBST: Mookie, what's a good

1282
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,392
reason you should get rid

1283
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,769
of Michelle?

1284
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,062
>> I mean guess one thing about

1285
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,647
Michelle is, uh, we had a

1286
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,314
relationship at the old Ravu,

1287
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,192
and we were good then, but she

1288
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,860
could have switched to a

1289
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,444
different side.

1290
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,487
That's something I'll have to

1291
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,030
think about in the next, I don't

1292
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:21,656
know how many minutes, you know,

1293
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,449
and determine who could be the

1294
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,159
biggest threat, and who can, you

1295
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,453
know, strengthen my alliance.

1296
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,496
>> PROBST: Michelle, give me a

1297
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,164
good reason to get rid of Alex.

1298
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,207
>> I think the biggest reason

1299
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,750
to get rid of Alex is that he's

1300
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,501
a threat in challenges.

1301
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,670
He performs very well every

1302
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:35,836
time.

1303
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,047
And when it comes down to

1304
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,131
immunity being so important

1305
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,550
now, it's definitely a threat.

1306
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,677
>> PROBST: Alex, give me a

1307
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,970
reason to get rid of Stacy.

1308
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,262
>> I don't really have a good

1309
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,305
reason to get rid of Stacy,

1310
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,098
Jeff.

1311
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:47,682
>> PROBST: Give me a reason to

1312
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,516
get rid of Michelle.

1313
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,559
>> I don't know Michelle as well

1314
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,103
as I know anyone else on this

1315
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:52,895
tribe right now.

1316
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,188
>> PROBST: Give me a reason to

1317
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:54,981
get rid of Mookie.

1318
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:55,606
>> I don't have a reason to get

1319
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,066
rid of Mookie.

1320
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:57,692
>> PROBST: Give me a reason to

1321
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,151
get rid of Dreamz.

1322
00:37:59,235 --> 00:37:59,777
>> I don't have a reason to get

1323
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,904
rid of Dreamz.

1324
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:02,947
>> PROBST: Dreamz, do you think

1325
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,949
as people speak here tonight,

1326
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:05,574
that they are speaking not only

1327
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,785
to me to answer a question, but

1328
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,078
also to everybody else here to

1329
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:09,662
kind of say "here's what I'm

1330
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,706
thinking" by giving me their

1331
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,623
answer?

1332
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,457
>> He just let you know whose

1333
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,168
name he's putting on the paper.

1334
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,670
He don't have to talk to me.

1335
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,213
He's one of the people I do

1336
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,256
trust in the game.

1337
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,382
So I understand where he's

1338
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,925
coming from.

1339
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,093
>> PROBST: Mookie, how do you

1340
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:24,719
think this will change the game,

1341
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,345
tonight's vote?

1342
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,638
>> I think it's going to reveal

1343
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,931
some things to the other guys

1344
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,557
that are eating steak right now.

1345
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,268
And they're going to see who's

1346
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:32,893
been telling the truth and who

1347
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,563
has been lying.

1348
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,356
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1349
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,149
to the vote.

1350
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:38,774
If somebody does have the hidden

1351
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,484
immunity idol, and it turns out

1352
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,028
you want to play it tonight, you

1353
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:42,653
would present it to me before I

1354
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,571
read the votes.

1355
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,364
It's time to vote.

1356
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:49,452
Alex, you're up.

1357
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:56,959
>> Sorry, Michelle.

1358
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,210
It's nothing personal.

1359
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,298
I'm just playing the game.

1360
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,852
>> You were on the list

1361
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:18,939
of people to go.

1362
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,542
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1363
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,630
votes.

1364
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,056
If anybody has the hidden

1365
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,099
immunity idol and you want

1366
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:53,641
to play it, now is the time

1367
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:59,605
to do so.

1368
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,898
Okay, once the votes are read,

1369
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:01,816
the decision is final.

1370
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,109
The person voted out will be

1371
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,151
asked to leave the Tribal

1372
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,319
Council area immediately.

1373
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,239
I'll read the votes.

1374
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,199
First vote...

1375
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,661
Stacy.

1376
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,704
Michelle.

1377
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,039
One vote Stacy, one vote

1378
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,334
Michelle.

1379
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:20,501
Stacy.

1380
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,628
Two votes Stacy,

1381
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:28,217
one vote Michelle.

1382
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,552
Michelle.

1383
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,636
We're tied.

1384
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,720
Two votes Michelle,

1385
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,471
two votes Stacy.

1386
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:39,979
One vote left.

1387
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:40,646
Ninth person voted out and the

1388
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:44,066
third member of our jury:

1389
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,484
Michelle.

1390
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,572
You need to bring me your torch.

1391
00:40:55,786 --> 00:41:00,875
Michelle, the tribe has spoken.

1392
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,584
Time for you to go.

1393
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,555
Well, it was clear tonight's

1394
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,015
vote will have a major impact

1395
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,683
on this game.

1396
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,101
And there are five people

1397
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,519
waiting back at camp eager to

1398
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,438
know exactly what that impact

1399
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,606
will be.

1400
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,858
Grab your stuff, head back to

1401
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,066
camp.

1402
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,110
Good night.

1403
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,333
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for

1404
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,417
scenes from our next episode.

1405
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,004
>> PROBST: Next time on

1406
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,714
<i>Survivor:</i>

1407
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,341
Mookie confronts Dreamz about

1408
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,593
his vote at Tribal Council...

1409
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,139
...and the fireworks begin.

1410
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:57,932
>> I am irritated with

1411
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,767
Cassandra.

1412
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,060
She just made the worst mistake

1413
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:01,602
of her life.

1414
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,645
>> I'm not going to deceive

1415
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,103
y'all.

1416
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:03,771
>> PROBST: And Dreamz can't

1417
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,689
keep quiet.

1418
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,738
>><i> Survivor</i> has been an amazing

1419
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,281
experience.

1420
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,741
I think my alliance is a little

1421
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,786
weaker now that I'm not there.

1422
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,329
Earl is going to have to find

1423
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,206
himself a new spy.

1424
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,166
But I think I've just affirmed

1425
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,584
I know what kind of person I

1426
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,211
am, and I know what I'm capable

1427
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,879
of, and that I'm just as strong

1428
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,382
as I thought.
