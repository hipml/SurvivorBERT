00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,461
>> JEFF PROBST: 27 days ago, two

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,338
tribes of ten castaways each

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,047
began an epic battle.

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,551
The purple tribe, Galu, won

5
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,344
almost every encounter.

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,972
Galu wins immunity!

7
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,223
By the time the two tribes

8
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,559
merged, the yellow tribe, Foa

9
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,310
Foa, was down to four.

10
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,103
The old Galu had eight, and

11
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,188
they planned to keep it that

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,897
way.

13
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,982
>> What's Samoan for "Get the

14
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:24,441
hell off my island"?

15
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,609
>> Look at us.

16
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,110
We're like savages.

17
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,404
>> PROBST: But the old Foa Foa

18
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,113
losses sharpened their ability

19
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,282
to strategize.

20
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,200
>> Things are about to change

21
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,285
totally in this game.

22
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,578
I don't think they even realize

23
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,412
it right now.

24
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,538
We're steps ahead of them.

25
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,914
We already have our plan down.

26
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,875
>> PROBST: And the plan worked.

27
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,501
At the next two Tribal

28
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,128
Councils, two of the old Galu

29
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,296
went home.

30
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,213
But the old Foa Foa paid a

31
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,341
price-- Russell had to play his

32
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,678
hidden immunity idol.

33
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,472
Then three game-changing

34
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,848
events took place.

35
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,850
One, Russell found another

36
00:00:58,933 --> 00:00:59,309
hidden immunity idol.

37
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,728
>> Oh, my God!

38
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,521
>> PROBST: Two, Shambo agreed

39
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,106
to vote with the Foa Foa four

40
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,232
to take out Laura.

41
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,817
>> It is the destiny of Laura

42
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,110
to go home.

43
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,653
>> PROBST: And, three, John

44
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,696
agreed to switch his vote,

45
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,322
hoping that Russell would vote

46
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,323
out a Foa Foa next.

47
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,658
>> Next one needs to be Foa Foa.

48
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,868
Deal?

49
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,869
>> Okay. That's a deal.

50
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,163
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

51
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,289
John changed his vote.

52
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,917
The ninth person voted out and

53
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,335
the third member of our jury.

54
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,878
And Laura made it three of the

55
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,298
old Galus in a row.

56
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,216
>> PROBST: And now, the entire

57
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,676
tribe is about to find out if

58
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,762
the old Foa Foa is as good at

59
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,263
holding on to a lead as they are

60
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,932
at getting one.

61
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:39,265
Nine are left.

62
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,393
Who will be voted out tonight?

63
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,738
(chickens clucking)

64
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,917
>> Medusa has been dethroned.

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,670
Is that just hysterical?

66
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,966
(snickering)

67
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,134
>> At Tribal tonight, Laura

68
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,970
went home.

69
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,596
The vote was 5-5.

70
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,431
The rules of<i> Survivor</i> say that

71
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,266
if there is another tie after a

72
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,768
second round of voting, the

73
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,895
remaining members would choose

74
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,063
rocks.

75
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,398
One of those rocks would be of

76
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,482
a different color, and that

77
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,650
person would go home.

78
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,776
I'm not going to go home

79
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,778
because of ridiculous rocks.

80
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,072
I gave multiple, multiple

81
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:37,657
explanations and multiple

82
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,992
rationale for why we should be

83
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:39,617
making different decisions, and

84
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,995
no dice.

85
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,747
I had a conversation with

86
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,291
Russell in which he and I said

87
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,626
the next person to go would be

88
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,210
Foa Foa.

89
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,462
So right now, I think I have a

90
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,630
pretty good position.

91
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,591
What's funny is, collectively,

92
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,467
they made the correct move, and

93
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,260
I made the correct move.

94
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,679
>> We all want to make it to

95
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,388
the end, but at some point, you

96
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,308
need to show loyalty and

97
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,268
integrity and respect for the

98
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,812
people that you made promises

99
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,813
to.

100
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,106
When it came down to it

101
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:10,815
tonight...

102
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,274
>> Uh-huh.

103
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,609
>> I still could not flop for

104
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,610
Laura.

105
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,903
I definitely have come to see

106
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,445
John as little bit more as a

107
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,864
Judas of the Galu tribe.

108
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,742

in the next immunity challenge.

291

this game right now.

299
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,679
This could make it one in eight.

300
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,680

>> PROBST: $300 to John.

305
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,146
>> I thought, uh, when John was

306
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,772
bidding on the item that would

307
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,691
do well in the challenge that

308
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,900
we needed to be in possession

309
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,193
of that item.

310
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,403
Maybe it was my turn to, you

311
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,654
know, sacrifice a little bit for

312
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,613
the good of the former Foa Foa.

313
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,991
I... Can I ask you a question

314
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:35,825
before I bid?

315
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,784
We both have 500 bucks.

316
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,785
What if we both bid $500?

317
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,786
>> PROBST: Somebody's going to

318
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:39,787

321
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,833
first?

322
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,627
>> PROBST: Yeah.

323
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,628

Bring it to the next immunity

330
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,138
challenge.

331
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,180
You will open it there.

332
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,181
We'll find out if it was worth

333
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,182
it.

334
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,183
>> Nice move.

335
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,601
>> PROBST: So Jaison spends all

336
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,520
his money on one item, and that

337
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,521
means no food.

338
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,522
Next item.

339
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:07,523

348
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,115

353
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,703

354
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,704
hilarity.

seeing you uncover that thing,

369
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,179
yeah, second, third, fourth,

want that hamburger.

372
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,516

Only one thing keeps you safe

383
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,990
in this game, and that is

384
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,158
immunity.

385
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,701
$200 to John.

386
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,872
Going once, going twice.

387
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,873
Sold to John.

388
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,332
>> Nice job, Johnnie.

389
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,750
>> Nice one, buddy.

390
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,294
>><i> Excuse moi.</i>

391
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,629
Russell may have the idol, you

392
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,630
know.

393
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,589
Anyone can.

394
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,173
>> PROBST: Take it with you.

395
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,883
Open this back at camp.

396
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,177
>> I'm not going to sit here and

397
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,470
go, "I'm gonna let the immunity

398
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,471
go.

399
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,514
Someone else can buy that."

400
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,516
Absolutely not.

401
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,102
Immunity is the goal.

402
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:26,936
>> PROBST: Next item-- you've

403
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,688
been looking at it.

404
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,148
It's the<i> Survivor</i> shower.

405
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,149
>> $100.

406
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,526
>> PROBST: Which John has bid

407
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,236
$100 on already.

408
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,946
Shampoo, conditioner, clean

409
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,781
underwear.

410
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,782
>> Clean underwear.

411
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,783
$120.

412
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,617
>> PROBST: $100 to John.

413
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,201
$120 to Natalie.

414
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,119
>> Go ahead and get in there,

415
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,120
girl.

416
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,413
>> PROBST: $120 to Natalie going

417
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,457
once, twice.

418
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,500
Sold to Natalie-- $120.

419
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,127
>> Oh, do it, girl.

420
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,711
>> No one wants to see old John

421
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,712
take a shower.

422
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,547
>> PROBST: Here's your towel.

423
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,131
>> Thank you.

424
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,592
>> PROBST: Enjoy your shower.

425
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,137
>> Oh, yes.

426
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,264
Oh, my goodness.

427
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,598
>> Whoo!

428
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:09,562
(laughter)

429
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:09,979
>> Oh, my goodness.

430
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,022
>> PROBST: Next item-- let's

431
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,357
uncover.

432
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,358
>> Oh!

433
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,485
>> PROBST: One gigantic piece of

434
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,611
apple pie.

435
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,612
>> $180.

436
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,613
>> $300.

437
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,156
>> PROBST: $180 to Brett.

438
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
$300 to John.

439
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,993
Going once, going twice.

440
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,328
$300-- sold to John.

441
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,663
>> Why's it always got to be

442
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,290
apple pie, my favorite?

443
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:29,999
Can't be something else.

444
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,000
>> PROBST: $300.

445
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,253
Now, that is what you bought.

446
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,254
That is yours.

447
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,465
You can keep that.

448
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,676
Before you dig into it, I'll

449
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,803
give you an option.

450
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,306
You can choose right now to keep

451
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,599
that piece of pie for yourself,

452
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,142
or you can give up your piece of

453
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,143
pie.

454
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:49,894
You will have no pie, and you

455
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,564
can divvy up among four people

456
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,565
an entire pie.

457
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,566
>> Oh!

458
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,025
>> Oh, my goodness.

459
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,026
>> PROBST: Do you remain

460
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,069
selfish, keep this for

461
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,113
yourself, or do you try to buy

462
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,239
some good will?

463
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,240
>> Well, what's the move?

464
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,575
What do you guys want?

465
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,202
Is anyone really stoked on pie?

466
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,244
>> Yes, I'm stoked on pie.

467
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:07,995
>> I love pie.

468
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,288
>> It's your move, man.

469
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,289
>> It's your choice.

470
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,332
It's your move, dude.

471
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,041
>> It sucks that this was my--

472
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,834
you know, there's always a

473
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,586
choice, but I'll eat the pie.

474
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,171
Everyone's nice and I'm

475
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,131
confident that no one's going to

476
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,049
vote me off because they didn't

477
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,593
get a piece of apple pie.

478
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,887
>> PROBST: Enjoy.

479
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,931
>> John should have gave the pie

480
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,933
to everybody.

481
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,309
It just showed how stingy he

482
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,310
was.

483
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,520
You're playing a game.

484
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,521
You're in the game.

485
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,563
You don't need to eat.

486
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,189
If it was me, I would have gave

487
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,942
it to my tribe-- Foa Foa-- and

488
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,653
Shambo, so I think it was a

489
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,654
terrible move.

490
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,947
It was terrible at that point in

491
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,948
the game.

492
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:44,865
>> PROBST: All right, that's

493
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,908
going to be it.

494
00:13:45,991 --> 00:14:10,891
The<i> Survivor</i> auction is over.

495
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,893
>> This morning I got a clue to

496
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,688
the hidden immunity idol, so

497
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,730
that's something that can help

498
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,274
me advance in this game and

499
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,984
potentially, you know, guarantee

500
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,777
me passage at least past the

501
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,070
next Tribal Council.

502
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,488
I'm hoping, you know, knock on

503
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,448
wood, that this is a pretty good

504
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,034
clue.

505
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,203
"The immunity idol is no rolling

506
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:31,954
stone.

507
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,915
At a fork in the road you'll see

508
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,126
a structure of rocks.

509
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,085
Which are covered with a blanket

510
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,879
of green.

511
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,549
So search at the base, you may

512
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,092
dirty your hands.

513
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,177
Remember, it's hidden, so it's

514
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:53,100
not easily seen."

515
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,395
I'm assuming it's buried.

516
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,996
I'm not seeing it right now.

517
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,539
I don't know if anyone had been

518
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,749
in here.

519
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,916
Everything outside is disturbed,

520
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,336
so it could be found already.

521
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,629
It's making me wonder if Russell

522
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,421
has the idol.

523
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,464
I mean, he's good at finding

524
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,507
idols without clues, but I'm

525
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,800
still going to make moves to

526
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,343
advance myself in this game.

527
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,637
Better safe than sorry.

528
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,222
I'll keep looking.

529
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,350
(chickens clucking)

530
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,363
>> We're going to have to have

531
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,073
you guys for lunch today, and I

532
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,366
just wanted to let you know,

533
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,367
okay?

534
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,242
(chicken squawks)

535
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,662
Well, I'll talk to you in Heaven

536
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,914
when I go to Heaven, okay?

537
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,751
Bye, chickens.

538
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,920
The chickens were probably my

539
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:07,508
single source of happiness the

540
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,175
last 29 days.

541
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,969
>> We can all take a hand in it.

542
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:11,387
>> I can't do it.

543
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,056
I won't do it.

544
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,641
I'll start bawling because I'm

545
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,684
really attached to those

546
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,184
chickens.

547
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,603
We'd have conversations and I'd

548
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,063
tell them, "I really need you

549
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,606
guys to lay me some eggs because

550
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,232
all these people want to kill

551
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,024
you."

552
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,651
And they'd go...

553
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,528
(squawks)

554
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,612
...like they understood and they

555
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,322
knew exactly what I was saying.

556
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,491
(chickens clucking)

557
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,075
I think that I brought them as

558
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,077
much peace as they brought me,

559
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,329
and it was a win-win.

560
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:46,004
Then... off with their heads.

561
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:46,588
(chickens clucking, Russell

562
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,800
mumbling)

563
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,927
(clucking stops)

564
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,305
>> You got him.

565
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,056
>> You got him.

566
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,099
>> That actually wasn't so bad.

567
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,100
>> Mm-mm.

568
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,935
>> Tell me when the chickens

569
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,896
stop screaming.

570
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,448
What I'm going to do is I'm

571
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,074
gonna part the chickens out, and

572
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm going to boil them in a

573
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,453
little bit of salt water and a

574
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:17,911
lot of fresh water.

575
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:18,287
>> Mm-hmm.

576
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,997
>> Can we rotisserie at least

577
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,998
one?

578
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:21,915
So we can get some, like...

579
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,624
>> No, absolutely not.

580
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,625
>> Why?

581
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,919
>> Because you'll lose 65%

582
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:26,920
yield.

583
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:27,504
I'll take care of the cooking

584
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,089
because I might not know a lot

585
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,549
about a lot of things, but when

586
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,720
it comes to cooking... that's

587
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,345
time to say "shut up" if you're

588
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,223
me.

589
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,516
>> I think most people just want

590
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,809
to skewer the chicken and put it

591
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,477
over the fire, but Shambo, being

592
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,479
the chef and all that, is going

593
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,439
to, like, want to do something

594
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,982
crazy, and so I-- you know, we

595
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,608
don't even care so long as we're

596
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,109
eating chicken today.

597
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,737
So I think that's the plan

598
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,780
unless somebody decides to veto

599
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,199
it later.

600
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,207
>> How's that chicken coming?

601
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,249
>> About another hour and a

602
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,250
half.

612
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,228

613
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,021
so I think I should be able to

00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:26,730

All right, everybody place your

759
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,609
left hand on the second position

760
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,861
on the rope.

761
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,738
Get a good grip and release

762
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,575
your right hand.

763
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,493
Hot day to be sitting out in the

764
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,621
sun holding on to a heavy log.

765
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,338
All right, everybody put your

766
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,631
left hand on the fourth position

767
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,632
on the knot.

768
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,968
>> Now I'm using both.

769
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,177
>> PROBST: Jaison using his two

770
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,178
spots right now.

771
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,847
Jaison is now only on the second

772
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,556
knot.

773
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,641
Everybody else is on the fourth

774
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,892
knot.

775
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,560
Jaison used that move very early

776
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,561
in this challenge.

777
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,564
See if it pays off.

778
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,717
All right, everybody, it is time

779
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,886
to move further down on the

780
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,262
rope.

781
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,722
Three, two, one.

782
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,809
Release.

783
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,560
Now the log's going to begin to

784
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,730
get heavy.

785
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:46,151
Shambo trying to hold on.

786
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,152
(glass breaking)

787
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,153
>> Oh!

788
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,154
>> PROBST: Shambo.

789
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:49,905
The log<i> and</i> Shambo take a

790
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:50,614
tumble.

791
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,699
Shambo, first person out of this

792
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,700
challenge.

793
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,701
You all right?

794
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,079
>> I'm good to go.

795
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,247
(glass breaking)

796
00:24:59,331 --> 00:24:59,873
>> PROBST: Russell, surprisingly

797
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:00,540
drops out.

798
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,625
What happened?

799
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,336
>> I got a charley horse in my

800
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,796
forearm, and that was it.

801
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,797
>> PROBST: All right, everybody,

802
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,424
it is time to make the last

803
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,425
move.

804
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,010
Switch hands.

805
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,012
Three, two, one.

806
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,765
And release.

807
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,017
You have no knot now to give

808
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,643
you any kind of leverage or any

809
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,645
kind of grip.

810
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,480
Now this rope can slip through

811
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
your hands a lot more easily.

812
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,566
Jaison, on the other hand, does

813
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,568
have a knot to hold on to, and

814
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,780
now will never feel all of the

815
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,657
weight of this log.

816
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,868
(rope creaking)

817
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,870
(glass breaking)

818
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,747
Monica drops her log.

819
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,332
>> All right, go ahead, boys.

820
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,333
(glass breaking)

821
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,126
>> PROBST: John's had enough.

822
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:52,968
He steps out of the challenge.

823
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,010
(glass breaking)

824
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:54,803
Brett cannot hold on any longer.

825
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,305
Brett is out of the challenge.

826
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,724
We are down to four-- Jaison,

827
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,686
Dave, Mick and Natalie.

828
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,813
I have to say, Natalie, you've

829
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,356
got to be the surprise of this

830
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,607
challenge right now.

831
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,776
(glass breaking)

832
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,195
Mick drops out of the challenge.

833
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,364
We are down to three.

834
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,200
We have two former Foa Foa, one

835
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,035
former Galu.

836
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,162
Everybody doing a good job of

837
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,706
digging deep.

838
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,040
Keep digging.

839
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,792
You have more in there.

840
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,961
You never know when it's your

841
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,713
turn to go.

842
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,966
You don't want it to be tonight.

843
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,551
(Jaison exhales loudly)

844
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,552
(rope creaking)

845
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,136
That hand better be bleeding

846
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:40,557
when you let go.

847
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,558
(glass breaking)

848
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,684
Natalie cannot hang in there any

849
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,685
longer.

850
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,686
>> Darn.

851
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,687
>> PROBST: Great effort.

852
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,771
Natalie out of the challenge.

853
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,690
And we are down to two, side by

854
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,610
side-- Jaison and Dave for

855
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,653
immunity.

856
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,198
Jaison has a two-knot advantage.

857
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:57,866
Dave Ball is holding on to rope

858
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,784
with no knot.

859
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,494
It could easily slip through his

860
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,498
hands.

861
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:05,874
(rope creaking)

862
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,460
>> You got it, Jaison.

863
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,836
>> PROBST: Dave with a bit of a

864
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,837
slip.

865
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,838
>> He's slipping.

866
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,839
>> Hang on, Jais.

867
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,800
>> Hang on.

868
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,970
(rope creaking)

869
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,016
(glass breaking)

870
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,017
>> PROBST: Dave Ball cannot hold

871
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,018
on any longer.

872
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,019
Jaison wins individual immunity!

873
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,020
>> Good job, Dave.

874
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,063
(glass breaking)

875
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,064
>> Yeah.

876
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,024
>> Good job.

877
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,025
>> When Dave's hand slipped and

878
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,026
the plate broke, it was like

879
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,027
heaven.

880
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,819
I mean, I'm not sure I would

881
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,820
have beaten Dave without that

882
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,821
advantage.

883
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,405
Shambo wants him gone, and the

884
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,656
former Foa Foa are trying to

885
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,449
strike while the iron is hot

886
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,450
with Shambo.

887
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,242
I just want to focus and

888
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,243
execute.

889
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,036
We've got to get Dave tonight.

890
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,037
>> PROBST: Jaison, come on over.

891
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,038
>> Victory!

892
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,039
>> Good job, Jaison.

893
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,040
>> Yay, Jaison!

894
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,041
>> Finally won something.

895
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,042
>> Finally you won!

896
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,043
>> Finally wins!

897
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,044
>> Great job, Jaison!

898
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:51,836
>> PROBST: Well, you passed up

899
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,837
chicken.

900
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,421
>> It cost me food and money,

901
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:53,880
yeah.

902
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:54,881
>> PROBST: You passed up

903
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,882
cheeseburger, but while

904
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,926
everybody else has a full belly,

905
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,220
you have something much more

906
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,263
valuable-- safety at tonight's

907
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,598
Tribal Council.

908
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,141
Jaison cannot be voted out.

909
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,851
As for the rest of you, after 30

910
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,645
days out here, one of you going

911
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,646
home tonight.

912
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,647
Grab your stuff.

913
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,648
Head back to camp.

914
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,942
I will see you at Tribal.

915
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,402
>> I am definitely in a position

916
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,904
of power with Foa Foa at my

917
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,156
disposal to vote how I ask them

918
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,157
to.

919
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,409
And they keep saying, "Shannon,

920
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,410
whatever you want."

921
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,869
Dave is so gone, he doesn't even

922
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:41,761
know it.

923
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,762
>> Man, good job today.

924
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,763
>> Dave, good work.

925
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,764
You almost beat me, and you had

926
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,765
no knot.

927
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,808
That's incredible.

928
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,767
>> You beat me fair and square,

929
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,810
bro.

930
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,769
>> Hey, awesome.

931
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,770
>> Well, I had...

932
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,312
>> Hey, you, too. Good job.

933
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:51,896
>> That was good.

934
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,772
>> You're on fire, man.

935
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,482
>> Thanks, man, thanks.

936
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,483
>> What were you doing up there?

937
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,526
Just think... just keep...?

938
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,527
>> Dave made a few comments to

939
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,862
Shambo about the chicken and how

940
00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,863
to cook it and stuff, and she

941
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,864
was furious, and, you know, when

942
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,948
she gets sort of angry at

943
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,825
somebody, that's who she wants

944
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,826
voted off, but at this point, we

945
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,745
kind of count on Shambo's votes,

946
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,080
so it's going to be Dave.

947
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,000
>> Thank you.

948
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,001
I'm bummed I lost, but, oh,

949
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,002
well.

950
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,003
>> It was nice, man.

951
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,796
>> You and me finally won

952
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,797
something, huh? Back to back.

953
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,798
>> I know, look at that.

954
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,924
>> I know...

955
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,426
>><i> C'est la vie.</i>

956
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,803
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

957
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,517
>> No way. No way.

958
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,075
>> Clearly, Galu is running

959
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,285
scared.

960
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,286
>> Right.

961
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,288
>> The next vote, I can get them

962
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,331
to vote off someone from

963
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,332
Foa Foa.

964
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,333
>> Right.

965
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,375
>> You already said you were

966
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,376
cool with that.

967
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,377
>> Right.

968
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,629
>> So I think we just lay low,

969
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,630
we hang out, not a lot...

970
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,673
>> So, right now, just, uh, I

971
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,758
guess we're thinking Mick right

972
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,759
now.

973
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,760
>> I mean, I think... I think

974
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,761
so, man.

975
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,762
>> It might be the best option,

976
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,763
uh, both ways, yeah.

977
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,181
>> And then we continue to move

978
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:08,890
on and move on and move on and

979
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,226
move on through this game and

980
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,227
progress further and further.

981
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,228
>> Right.

982
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,354
>> And if something crazy

983
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,647
happens, because you have ears

984
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,065
here and I have ears there...

985
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,066
>> Yeah, I'll let you know.

986
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,527
>> If we are... If we do find

987
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,195
ourselves outgunned, we can see

988
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,196
it coming...

989
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,197
>> Right.

990
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,281
>> ...we play the idol, and

991
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,409
then we're done.

992
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:31,955
>> You have it.

993
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,956
I'm 100% sure...

994
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,957
>> Where-Where... Where'd you

995
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,958
look?

996
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:35,959
>> Uh... well, I...

997
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,001
>> Tell me where the clue was,

998
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,002
and I'll tell you, I'll give

999
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,003
you a hint.

1000
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,046
>> What do you mean?

1001
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,047
>> Tell me where the clue was,

1002
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,048
and I'll tell you where the

1003
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,175
idol is.

1004
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,176
At first, we were thinking, get

1005
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,177
rid of Dave.

1006
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,345
Everybody's on board to get rid

1007
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,388
of Dave.

1008
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,389
It was<i> in</i> the wall 'cause it

1009
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,390
didn't roll off.

1010
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,391
>> Yeah. Right, right.

1011
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,392
>> So, it was sitting inside.

1012
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,393
>> Yeah, exactly.

1013
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,060
>> In the meantime, probably the

1014
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,187
best move would be to get rid of

1015
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,188
John.

1016
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,189
He's a threat strategically,

1017
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,526
and, uh... and I told him that I

1018
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:07,407
had the immunity idol.

1019
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,408
And I go, "Good for me..."

1020
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,409
>> Right.

1021
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,410
>> "...if anyone has it, 'cause

1022
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,661
I thought about the numbers.'

1023
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,704
>> I knew he knew I had it.

1024
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,663
So he said, "I know you have

1025
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,664
it."

1026
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,665
So I didn't want to sit there--

1027
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,666
"No, I don't, no, I don't."

1028
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,084
So I said, "Yeah, I have it,

1029
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,043
and it can help us."

1030
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,128
So now, I have to get rid of

1031
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,087
John.

1032
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,088
>> As long as you give me your

1033
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,881
word that you're not voting for

1034
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,716
me, we're both here after the

1035
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,717
vote, we can continue to work...

1036
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,718
>> Right.

1037
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,719
These poor people need to close

1038
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,304
their ears when I start talking,

1039
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,597
'cause when I tell you

1040
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,598
something, and I made a mistake,

1041
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,098
I got to get rid of you.

1042
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:32,974
It was my mistake, but, sorry,

1043
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:33,975
John, you've got to go home for

1044
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,853
it.

1045
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,146
Sounds good to me, man, as long

1046
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,188
as, uh, we stick together...

1047
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,189
>> I mean, you're not going to

1048
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,190
burn me the next vote, I'm not

1049
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,233
gonna burn you the next vote.

1050
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,234
I'm mean, we're rolling.

1051
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,277
>> Yeah, as long as we stick

1052
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,278
together, then we can do this,

1053
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,279
the whole way through.

1054
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,238
>> So we're fine.

1055
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,951
>> All right, cool.

1056
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,952
I can save you tonight.

1057
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:53,953
It would be you.

1058
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:54,954
>> It would be me?

1059
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,955
>> It would definitely.

1060
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,123
>> I had a feeling.

1061
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,752
>> Now, it's going to be Shambo,

1062
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,753
and the whole Foa Foa tribe.

1063
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,837
>> Mm-hmm.

1064
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,047
>> That's whose the vote is.

1065
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,048
>> Okay.

1066
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,342
>> I think the best way to do

1067
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,178
this is get rid of John tonight.

1068
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,721
And there's no reason I would be

1069
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:12,722
lying about this...

1070
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,681
>> Mm.

1071
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,265
>> ...because why would I come

1072
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,100
to you saying, I want to get rid

1073
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,268
of him when your name's in the

1074
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,269
sling right now?

1075
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,270
>> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1076
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,272
>> Is-Is Monica close to John?

1077
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,149
Can you tell her without her

1078
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,109
going to John and saying

1079
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,152
anything?

1080
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,153
>> I could probably say

1081
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,154
something to her.

1082
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,155
>> All right.

1083
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,156
>> Uh, yeah, yeah, well, you

1084
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,616
know what, is-- I mean, after

1085
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,617
he, uh, flipped on Laura, a

1086
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,618
matter of frigging time.

1087
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,619
You know, nobody trusts him

1088
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,620
anymore.

1089
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,621
>> It will be you if it's not

1090
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,666
John.

1091
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,501
I want you to stay in the game.

1092
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,211
>> All right.

1093
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,212
Because I almost won it today,

1094
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,213
huh?

1095
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,422
>> That was pretty impressive.

1096
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,423
>> All right.

1097
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,883
>> I don't want them to see me

1098
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:49,384
talking to you too much.

1099
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,134
>> All right.

1100
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,135
All right, brother.

1101
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,136
>> All right, man.

1102
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,306
>> All right.

1103
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,063
>> If you had a choice to get

1104
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,107
rid of anybody in this game

1105
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,109
right now, who would it be?

1106
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,610
>> John.

1107
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,655
>> He is dangerous.

1108
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,825
>> Most dangerous person here.

1109
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:14,909
>> With him gone, things would

1110
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,160
be... we could run it down.

1111
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,829
>> Oh, dude, it'd be cake.

1112
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,081
>> Dave is way too scared right

1113
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,208
now to not make this deal.

1114
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,376
Way too scared.

1115
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,836
We just talked for about 30

1116
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,920
minutes.

1117
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:26,212
>> You did?

1118
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,256
I don't know, what do you

1119
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,424
think, man?

1120
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,633
I think we try John.

1121
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,260
>> I think we get rid of John.

1122
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,136
>> What happens next week with

1123
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,137
Dave gone?

1124
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,430
What is Shambo going to do?

1125
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,431
We don't know.

1126
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,724
Dude, I don't trust them.

1127
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,101
I don't trust them at all.

1128
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,269
All right, so you really

1129
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:41,602
believe this.

1130
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,270
>> Dude, it's real... this is

1131
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,062
gonna happen.

1132
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,814
>> Okay, all right.

1133
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,523
>> For sure.

1134
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,315
>> All right.

1135
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,443
>> John.

1136
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,784
>> So, basically, Russell and I

1137
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,994
started talking, and he's, like,

1138
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,120
"Who would you get rid of if you

1139
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,204
could get rid of anybody

1140
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,414
right now?"

1141
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,081
Clearly, I said, John.

1142
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,208
He's, like, "We can do that, I

1143
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,335
think."

1144
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,383
>> No.

1145
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,968
It would be us four...

1146
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,678
>> The next round, I know we can

1147
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,054
get him.

1148
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,222
But next round's gonna be a

1149
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,515
four-four tie, 'cause Shambo's

1150
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,684
gonna leave us in two seconds.

1151
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,022
Taking her for granted.

1152
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,148
You're telling me you really

1153
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,316
agree with this?

1154
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,734
>> This may be one of our only

1155

shots to get rid of John.

1156

>> Why?

1157
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,945
>> Nothing's for sure, but it

1158
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:33,529
just seems like we do have the

1159
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,822
numbers.

1160
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,990

1161
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:36,491
piss off Shambo, and she's

1162
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,326
gonna go to the other side,

1163
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,535
and then we're gonna have to

1164

1166
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,332
settle Shambo.

food at the auction for one

1177

only won it because you had the

advantage, but that doesn't

challenge?

was close, I wanted it real bad,

and downs within the last 30

know they're going.

1274
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,320

1276
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,656
gonna be a shocking vote tonight

the way I'm expecting it to go,

1280
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,454

1282
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,335
take on tonight's vote?

1283
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,421
>> I think that of the two

1284
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,339
potential names, you've asked

1285
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,382
both of them questions, and

1286
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,384
they both said they wouldn't be

1287
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,468
shocked, so I think the answer

1288
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,304
is no.

1289
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:27,930

Jaison, you earned that

1292
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,600
immunity.

1293
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,685
I assume you're keeping it?

1294
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,519
>> Yeah.

1295
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,562
>> PROBST: All right, you

1296
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,813
cannot vote for Jaison.

1297

Everybody else is fair game.

1298
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:37,565

1299

continue.

1300
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,943
It is time to vote.

1301
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,070
Monica, you're up.

1302

chickens.

1304
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,342
They were great friends.

1305
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,699
>> John, I'm voting for you

1306
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,451
because it might get me closer

1307
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,869
to a million bucks.

1308
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,996
Sorry, pal.

1309

If anybody has the hidden

1312
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,303
immunity idol and you want to

1313
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:50,513
play it, now would be the time

1314
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,640
to do so.

1315
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,727
Okay. Once the votes are read,

1316
