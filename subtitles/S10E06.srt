00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,586
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,963
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:05,714
>> Your shoulder's right

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,507
on my head.

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,508
>> JEFF: A close relationship

6
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:09,592
developed at Koror.

7
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,385
>> Jennifer and Gregg have

8
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,470
definitely teamed off.

9
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,346
I mean, they've got to

10
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,264
to think we're stupid

11
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:14,723
if we can't tell that

12
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,141
they're together.

13
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,058
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa...

14
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:17,600
>> JEFF: Ulong got lost in a

15
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,184
storm.

16
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,562
>> I'm going back to camp.

17
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,229
>> Why are you going

18
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,147
back to camp by yourself?

19
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,981
>> Why can't I?

20
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:23,732
>> Angie wanted to quit.

21
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:24,733
She's one of those folks

22
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,234
that says, "I can't do this."

23
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,111
>> JEFF: At Koror, Willard's

24
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,155
work ethic was questioned when

25
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,239
he failed to tend to the fire.

26
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,240
>> Willard's been getting a

27
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,783
free ride, and he's been able

28
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,826
to play this game

29
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,410
a lot longer than he should.

30
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,037
>> JEFF: At the challenge...

31
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,205
Win or lose, both tribes

32
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,040
are going to Tribal Council

33
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:41,583
tonight.

34
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,667
The winning tribe will

35
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,419
vote somebody out.

36
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,170
They will then cross

37
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:45,587
to the jury side,

38
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,631
help themselves to some stew

39
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,633
and root beer and listen in

40
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,259
as the losing tribe

41
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,553
has their Tribal Council.

42
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,680
Ibrehem down.

43
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,765
Ibrehem failed to retrieve

44
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,224
a bottle.

45
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,518
>> Come on, Ib!

46
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,895
>> JEFF: Koror wins reward.

47
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,814
>> Get on the raft!

48
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,273
>> JEFF: At Ulong...

49
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,108
>> I can't believe we lost.

50
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,151
>> JEFF: Ibrehem's mistake was

51
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,944
hard to overlook.

52
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,071
>> We had it in the bag.

53
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,323
Then Ibrehem, we lost because of

54
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:13,490
him.

55
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,535
He's history.

56
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,286
>> JEFF: Jubilation turned

57
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,288
to paranoia, as Koror faced

58
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:20,830
their first Tribal Council.

59
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,748
>> He's out, right?

60
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,290
>> Yeah.

61
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,834
( indistinct voices )

62
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,376
>> Don't tell anyone.

63
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:25,668
>> I won't.

64
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,294
>> JEFF: And Gregg let Coby

65
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,546
in on his plan with Jenn.

66
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,172
Once Willard and Caryn are gone,

67
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,634
it becomes seven people,

68
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,345
me, Jenn, you and Janu.

69
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:35,804
Then we start picking

70
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,638
them off.

71
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,305
>> I'm very excited.

72
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,390
I love that the game is going

73
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,308
to a new level.

74
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,601
I can't wait.

75
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,268
>> JEFF: At Koror's first

76
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,228
Tribal Council...

77
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,188
Fifth person voted out

78
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,356
of Survivor Palau...

79
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,732
Willard was voted out.

80
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,775
The tribe has spoken.

81
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,694
Koror, go ahead and pull off

82
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:51,945
the cover.

83
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,905
Koror then dug into their beef

84
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,074
stew reward in front of a

85
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,617
dejected Ulong tribe.

86
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,368
>> Oh!

87
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,411
>> It was really close today.

88
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,371
We really needed this.

89
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,331
>> It seems like all I've heard

90
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,749
today is "Wow, we could have

91
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,834
really been eating that beef

92
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:06,709
stew right now," like that's

93
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,627
the end of the game,

94
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,212
like beef stew is it.

95
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,213
>> JEFF: And with Ibrehem on

96
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,005
the chopping block,

97
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,340
there was one more surprise.

98
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,424
Koror, you are going

99
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,260
to vote to give immunity

100
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,636
to one person from Ulong.

101
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,638
Koror voted and gave immunity

102
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,014
to Ibrehem.

103
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,182
With a wrench thrown into

104
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,393
Ulong's plans, Bobby Jon and

105
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,562
Angie each received two votes.

106
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,981
We have a tie.

107
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,565
Stephenie had first voted for

108
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,401
Bobby Jon, but in the tiebreaker

109
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,360
she changed her vote, and Angie

110
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,404
was voted out.

111
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,031
The tribe has spoken.

112
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:37,323
12 are left.

113
00:02:37,407 --> 00:03:19,699
Who will be voted out tonight?

114
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:47,352
♪ ♪

115
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,355
♪ ♪

116
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,627
>> That may have been the

117
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,753
craziest Tribal Council

118
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:14,337
I've ever been to.

119
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,340
From walking in, believing

120
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:17,715
that I was going

121
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,299
to be voted off,

122
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,052
but then the tide got turned

123
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,095
and the other tribe ended up

124
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:22,512
giving me immunity.

125
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,931
And, uh, someone else ended up

126
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,975
getting voted off instead of me.

127
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:27,725
>> I think for the next

128
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,519
challenge, not only do we

129
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,645
need to have great listening

130
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,562
skills, because I'm also...

131
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,814
>> Yeah, everybody needs to

132
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,940
listen.

133
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:34,607
>> I mean, like...

134
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,525
>> Keep your ears open

135
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,526
and listen to your teammates.

136
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,361
>> Tonight at Tribal Council,

137
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,654
Ib got the immunity.

138
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,030
So, um, Angie was the one that

139
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,489
ended up going.

140
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,157
But you know, he knew was gonna

141
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:43,783
get voted off,

142
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,076
and he knows he's going next,

143
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,702
'cause I'm not changing my mind.

144
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,454
So we'll see what happens.

145
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,541
>> I was pissed at you, really.

146
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:51,916
You wasn't paying

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,375
attention today.

148
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,460
That was your problem.

149
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,294
>> Okay.

150
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,379
>> Okay?

151
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,923
You cost us the game because

152
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,842
you didn't pay attention.

153
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,843
All you had to do was

154
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,427
yank on the bottle.

155
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,885
>> Yeah, you're right.

156
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,845
>> You were yanking

157
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,345
on the rope.

158
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,097
>> No, ain't none of us perfect.

159
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,223
>> You should have been at

160
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,099
least honest and, uh...

161
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:08,725
>> About what?

162
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,350
>> ...told us that you couldn't

163
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,351
dive down deep enough

164
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,394
to get the bottle.

165
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,312
>> Didn't I tell you I was

166
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:13,688
honest about it?

167
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,189
I told you, if you was

168
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:15,773
listening, I said I dove down

169
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,108
I was at two bottles,

170
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,192
and I tried to pull the rope.

171
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,110
>> Yeah, all we know is

172
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,028
you went down three times,

173
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,237
didn't come up with a bottle.

174
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,821
>> Bottom line is,

175
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,239
we just need to win now.

176
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,407
'Cause we really can't afford to

177
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,283
lose anybody else.

178
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,492
I mean for real.

179
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,202
>> And you need to focus,

180
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,662
you know.

181
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,705
>> James just kind of put

182
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,372
Ibrehem on the spot.

183
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,582
I mean...

184
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't agree with that,

185
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,168
you know.

186
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,294
I mean, we win as a team

187
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,086
and lose as a team.

188
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,670
Yeah, he-he missed the bottle,

189
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,840
and we didn't win the beef stew.

190
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,383
I mean, whatever, you know.

191
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,468
You can't get over

192
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,219
beef and stew?

193
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,930
Please.

194
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,735
>> A lot of times I'm able to

195
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,903
get off on my own away by

196
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,696
myself and actually do my

197
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,741
prayers.

198
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,827
I think if things would have

199
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,204
just stayed on track at Tribal,

200
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,413
I'm pretty sure I-I probably

201
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,248
wouldn't be here right now.

202
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,792
I don't know.

203
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,584
The way things happen,

204
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:16,918
I almost think

205
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,711
God had a hand in it.

206
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,462
I feel like I'm definitely

207
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,422
meant to be here.

208
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,591
I think you appreciate things

209
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,592
a little more when it's almost

210
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,511
taken away from you,

211
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,929
so I think I got

212
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,556
a whole new grasp on it.

213
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:50,827
>> Last night was the first

214
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,829
Tribal Council, and we had to

215
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,873
vote somebody off, which

216
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,667
ended up being Willard.

217
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,544
And then, we got to eat our

218
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,294
stew.

219
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,420
Right away, you started, you

220
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,588
felt this rush of energy back.

221
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,048
And the crew woke up

222
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,424
this morning very charged up

223
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,801
and refreshed.

224
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,219
And it's just another day

225
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,762
in paradise today.

226
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,180
>> Idle hands are the devil's

227
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,558
plaything, you know.

228
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,060
You know what?

229
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:16,686
It's a different day, you know.

230
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,354
We all got fed,

231
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:18,980
everyone's got a little energy,

232
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,731
and everyone's doing a project.

233
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,192
Today is a day just to kind of

234
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:23,776
do something to save ourselves

235
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,528
some work down the road.

236
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,948
>> What do you think?

237
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,826
>> That's pretty.

238
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,162
That's so cool.

239
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,206
Camp Koror had craft day.

240
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:37,957
Well, just Katie;

241
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,333
everybody else was working.

242
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,878
Didn't help with the fire,

243
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,503
didn't go hunt,

244
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,504
didn't go do anything.

245
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,005
But she made necklaces,

246
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,214
God love her.

247
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,551
Actually, more of a headband.

248
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,802
>> I feel great, I really do.

249
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,636
I thought it'd be harder than

250
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,762
this.

251
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,138
And it will be,

252
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:52,722
and I'm prepared for that.

253
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,891
So I think that if you keep

254
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,641
that state of mind,

255
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,518
then you can survive.

256
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,728
>> It's pretty.

257
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,104
>> So what do you do after

258
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:00,938
you get the three...?

259
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:01,689
>> You just start

260
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,316
tying them together.

261
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,525
>> I would like to see Katie

262
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:04,942
work a little harder

263
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,361
and move a little faster.

264
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,863
It appears that she's just here

265
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,697
to entertain.

266
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,781
She sings, she's cheerful,

267
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,992
she makes a lot of jokes.

268
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,785
But what is her role here?

269
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:19,207
I don't know.

270
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,041
>> I'm so sad!

271
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,667
>> Boo-hoo!

272
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,544
( shouting )

273
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,754
>> My name is Angie, and I can

274
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,672
smell the stew.

275
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,673
( laughter )

276
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,759
>> I'm Bobby Jon.

277
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,092
I love everyone,

278
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,552
and I look like Jesus Christ.

279
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,929
( laughter )

280
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,264
Waaah...!

281
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,183
Waaah...!

282
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,605
>> Open the box.

283
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,733
Ooh.

284
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,277
( gasps )

285
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,112
Pringle!

286
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,489
Tree mail!

287
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,074
>> Tree mail!

288
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,742
>> Guess what it has on it?

289
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,493
>> Guess!

290
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,786
It starts with a P!

291
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:01,207
>> And ends with a "le"!

292
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,708
Pringle!

293
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,292
>> Pringle?

294
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:03,751
>> Pringle?

295
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,628
Oh.

296
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,965
>> "Ready, aim, fire.

297
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,132
"You'll each get a shot.

298
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:10,341
>> Yeah!

299
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,260
>> "Make sure it's a good one,

300
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,303
you'll be bummed if it's not.

301
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,055
"No strength required,

302
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,307
a steady hand to compete.

303
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,058
See the wonders

304
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,268
"of these islands

305
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,019
and give your taste buds

306
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:22,311
a treat."

307
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,105
( cheering )

308
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:24,647
>> So, it sounds like

309
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,648
it's going to be some sort

310
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,108
of shooting competition.

311
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:27,692
We don't know whether

312
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,776
or not it's bow and arrow,

313
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,027
we don't know if it's slingshot,

314
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,820
gun.

315
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,862
But, yeah, we really

316
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,072
want to win this.

317
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,575
( all growling )

318
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:46,794
>> JEFF: Come on in, Koror.

319
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,754
Koror getting your first look

320
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,507
at the new Ulong tribe.

321
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,050
Angie voted out at the last

322
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,760
Tribal Council.

323
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,016
>> Ready for today's challenge?

324
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:00,683
>> Yes.

325
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,560
>> JEFF: There are 16

326
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,978
tribe-colored tiles, eight for

327
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,439
Koror, eight for Ulong.

328
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,940
Using a replica of a 50-caliber

329
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,234
small-class cannon,

330
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,319
you're going to attempt

331
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,779
to knock out your tribe tiles.

332
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,573
First tribe to knock out all

333
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,575
eight of their tribe tiles

334
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,409
wins reward.

335
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,660
Want to know what you're playing

336
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,286
for?

337
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,370
>> Yeah.

338
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,496
>> JEFF: Well, it started this

339
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,372
morning with your tree mail.

340
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,707
Pringles is part of your reward.

341
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,293
The winning tribe will leave

342
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,294
here and you will board

343
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,420
a very unique, one-of-a-kind

344
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:29,879
Japanese boat.

345
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,714
On board, you'll have

346
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,217
Pringles and mai-tais.

347
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,471
>> Oh, my God!

348
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,598
>> JEFF: While you're relaxing,

349
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,058
you'll cruise out to a body of

350
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,060
water called Jellyfish Lake.

351
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,144
It is literally home

352
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,439
to millions of jellyfish.

353
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,190
You're gonna snorkel

354
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,316
with the jellyfish.

355
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:50,775
And the good news is,

356
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,776
they can't hurt you.

357
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,986
They have lost their necessity

358
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,405
and their ability to sting.

359
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,490
You've never seen anything

360
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,824
like this.

361
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,576
You'll be rejuvenated,

362
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,411
get some food in your belly,

363
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,162
couple of drinks--

364
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,830
could be a whole new game.

365
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,539
Worth playing for?

366
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:05,790
>> Yeah!

367
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,333
>> Yes, sir.

368
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,876
>> JEFF: All right, Koror, you

369
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,169
have four extra members-- you're

370
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:10,753
sitting four people out--

371
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,004
who's it gonna be?

372
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,923
>> Katie, Janu, Jenn and me.

373
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,840
>> JEFF: Have a seat on the

374
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,469
bench; we'll get started.

375
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,266
>> JEFF: All right, after

376
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,352
rock-paper-scissor, Ulong, you

377
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,145
won the right to go first.

378
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,563
Once you establish your order,

379
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,774
keep it.

380
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,526
Ready, aim, and whenever you're

381
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,237
ready, Bobby Jon.

382
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,784
Low.

383
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,660
Gregg.

384
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,828
Let's go, Gregg.

385
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,537
Take a little while

386
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,876
to get used to this sight.

387
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,879
>> Almost.

388
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,463
>> JEFF: James.

389
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,757
You shoot a lot of guns?

390
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,217
>> Yeah.

391
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,802
>> JEFF: Whenever you're ready.

392
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,928
Ooh.

393
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:01,804
>> Wow!

394
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,014
>> JEFF: Just misses.

395
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,559
Coby. Still no score.

396
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,184
>> Go, farm boy.

397
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,436
>> JEFF: Coby could put Koror

398
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,148
in the lead.

399
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,649
Just misses.

400
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,402
Ibrehem.

401
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,987
Take your aim.

402
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,071
Learn from the people

403
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,116
who've gone before you.

404
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,201
Low.

405
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,996
Tom.

406
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,626
( loud cheering )

407
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,043
>> JEFF: Tom.

408
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,837
The first to hit a tile.

409
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,214
Koror leads, one-zip.

410
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:44,305
All right, Steph.

411
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:44,972
>> JEFF: That's it!

412
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:45,347
Steph drills it!

413
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,933
We're tied, one-one.

414
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,351
Caryn getting her first shot

415
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,688
at the gun.

416
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,566
Just misses.

417
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,236
Bobby Jon coming back up.

418
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,905
Bobby Jon

419
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,072
connects for Ulong!

420
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,325
Ulong leads two, one.

421
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,784
( indistinct talking )

422
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,830
Gregg could tie it up for Koror.

423
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,956
That's how you do it!

424
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,835
We're tied up at two-two.

425
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,421
James.

426
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,510
Ooh.

427
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,594
Coby could put Koror

428
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,180
in the lead.

429
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,598
Just misses.

430
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,894
Ibrehem.

431
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,603
>> Yes!

432
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,812
>> Nice!

433
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,355
>> JEFF: Ibrehem connects.

434
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,608
Three-two, Ulong leads.

435
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,692
Tom had no troubles

436
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,194
his first time.

437
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,154
Let's see if he can tie it up.

438
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,365
Ooh. Just misses.

439
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,492
Steph.

440
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,329
>> JEFF: She does!

441
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,080
Ulong leads, four-two;

442
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,334
they're halfway there.

443
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,961
Caryn makes it three for Koror.

444
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,254
>> Yes!

445
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,088
>> JEFF: That's five-three,

446
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,714
Ulong.

447
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,006
>> Yeah!

448
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,925
>> JEFF: Gregg keeps Koror in

449
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,678
it.

450
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,846
James, you are oh-fer.

451
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,597
>> You ain't lyin'!

452
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,267
I'm doggin' it today, ain't I?

453
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:14,979
>> JEFF: Still dry.

454
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,856
>> Still dry.

455
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,066
>> JEFF: Takes his aim...

456
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,901
Tom up for Koror.

457
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,238
Ulong with a five-four lead.

458
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:24,989
Steph would like

459
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,240
to increase that.

460
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:26,907
And she does!

461
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,911
Ulong leads, six-four.

462
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,580
Ulong with only two tiles left.

463
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,163
You're pretty good

464
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,374
with that gun.

465
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,043
( inhales sharply )

466
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,379
>> Yeah!

467
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,880
>> JEFF: Caryn connects!

468
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,049
Koror with five.

469
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,593
>> You got it.

470
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,970
>> JEFF: And he connects!

471
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,013
>> Yes!

472
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:49,471
>> JEFF: Ulong leads

473
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,432
seven-five-- they're one tile

474
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,100
away from reward.

475
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,856
>> Yes!

476
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,189
>> Yes!

477
00:14:59,273 --> 00:14:59,773
>> JEFF: Gregg connects for

478
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,482
Koror!

479
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,318
We are at seven-six.

480
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,153
Here's where things stand.

481
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,654
One tile left.

482
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,155
Knock it out, you win.

483
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:13,287
Miss and Koror is still alive.

484
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,622
Low and to the right.

485
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,039
Koror still in this.

486
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,374
Coby, you need to connect

487
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,375
to keep you alive.

488
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,045
Ulong leads, seven-six.

489
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,129
You like this pressure,

490
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,090
don't you?

491
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,638
Coby does it!

492
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,015
We are tied, seven-seven.

493
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,099
Ibrehem, if you connect,

494
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,935
you will have eight,

495
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,145
Koror will get last shot

496
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:43,984
to tie it up.

497
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:44,318
Ooh.

498
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,778
Just misses to the right,

499
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,657
opens the door for Koror.

500
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,240
Tom, because Ulong went first,

501
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:54,536
you guys get last shot.

502
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,120
You have one tile left-- that

503
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,122
means if you hit it, you win it.

504
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,540
Pringles, mai-tais,

505
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,251
Jellyfish Lake.

506
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,714
For the win.

507
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:05,881
Ooh!

508
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,384
Just misses.

509
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,134
Steph, you have one tile left--

510
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,053
hit it, you'll have eight

511
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,932
tiles, Koror will get last shot.

512
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,023
Steph does it again!

513
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,108
Ulong with eight tiles;

514
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,861
Koror gets their last shot.

515
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,279
Pressure is on Caryn.

516
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,364
It's very simple, Caryn--

517
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,574
hit your tile,

518
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,659
you force a tiebreaker;

519
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,829
miss, Ulong wins reward.

520
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,249
It's all on you.

521
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,042
>> You got it, Caryn.

522
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,504
>> JEFF: Get your aim.

523
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,597
Misses low to the left!

524
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:55,973
Ulong wins reward!

525
00:16:56,056 --> 00:17:01,019
( shouting, cheering )

526
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,358
>> Pringles and mai-tais!

527
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,276
>> JEFF: Koror, something

528
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,361
you haven't experienced

529
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,238
much of in 13 days out here:

530
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:11,947
defeat.

531
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,240
I got nothing for you.

532
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,075
Ulong, I don't know if a tribe

533
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,493
has ever needed a reward

534
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,244
like you guys.

535
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,496
Great shooting, Steph.

536
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:19,913
Pringles, mai-tai,

537
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,542
Jellyfish Lake.

538
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,475
>> We won the reward;

539
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:39,808
I freaked out.

540
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,727
It was just such a nice feeling

541
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,186
to know what it's like

542
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,687
to win again.

543
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,313
I mean, we've been losing so

544
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,315
much, and I hate that feeling.

545
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,817
Hello, Pringles and mai-tais...

546
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,818
Oh, my God, I see...

547
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,569
( mumbles inaudibly )

548
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,278
I knew that we needed this

549
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,781
to boost our spirits and morale,

550
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,365
and it... it basically, it was

551
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,995
a whole new chapter for us.

552
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,622
>> Look at that.

553
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,332
>> Oh, hell, yeah!

554
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,250
( groans )

555
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,919
Let's have a toast.

556
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,128
Oh, I get the pink one, too.

557
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,172
>> Everybody, get you a bottle.

558
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,465
>> Oh, my God.

559
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,549
>> Okay.

560
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,510
>> Look--<i> Survivor</i> Pringles.

561
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,010
>> Ah.

562
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,136
>> This is cool.

563
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,887
>> It's trivia.

564
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,638
>> Yeah, I know.

565
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,180
>> Yeah.

566
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,348
All right, ready?

567
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,390
"Which Survivor: Pearl Islands

568
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,475
castaway has a daughter

569
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,267
named Raya?"

570
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:22,726
>> Rupert.

571
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,018
>> Rupert.

572
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:23,227
>> Yes.

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,065
which that was kind of neat.

576
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,149
And we were all kind of, like,

577
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:29,858
reading our questions,

578
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,484
answer 'em, eating the Pringles.

579
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,277
>> "Which three<i> Survivor</i>

580
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,988
all-stars won cars during the

581
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,406
show?"

582
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,282
>> Who was it?

583
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:37,783
>> Boston Rob and Amber.

584
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,617
>> And?

585
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,910
>> Shii Ann.

586
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,328
"Who won more, men or women?"

587
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,579
>> Men.

588
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,247
>> Women.

589
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,499
Isn't that amazing?

590
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,959
Pretty damn good.

591
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,377
We got to have another toast.

592
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,503
Think so.

593
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,796
Name of this toast is called

594
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,213
"From here on out."

595
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,882
From here on out...

596
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,174
>> We win.

597
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,509
>> We win.

598
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:55,884
>> We're buddies.

599
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,052
>> And keep going...

600
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,471
going with the tide.

601
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,398
>> Oh, I think we made it.

602
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,983
>> After we climbed

603
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,192
to the top of the mountain,

604
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,318
we see this lake,

605
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:13,694
and it's just...

606
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,445
it's just crystal clear.

607
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,614
It's just amazing to know that

608
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,699
you're about to go somewhere

609
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,616
where all these jellyfish

610
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,576
are at, and none of them can

611
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,368
sting you 'cause they lost their

612
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,661
stinging tentacles,

613
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,662
because they're in fresh water,

614
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,746
and they've been there

615
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,123
for millions of years.

616
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,709
>> Let's do this.

617
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,384
You're swimming in the water,

618
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,720
and all of a sudden you see,

619
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,762
oh, there's a jellyfish,

620
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,180
and then five minutes later,

621
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,932
you're with millions, and...

622
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,558
they're just all just coming at

623
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,475
you.

624
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,101
It's just...

625
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:46,935
It's kind of like

626
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,103
a euphoric type of feeling.

627
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,271
And I just kind of wanted

628
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:49,771
to cherish every second,

629
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,815
'cause I was at a place

630
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:52,441
in this world where I won't ever

631
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,527
go again.

632
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,364
>> The win for us today

633
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,992
was a huge boost of morale.

634
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,119
We feel confident now.

635
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:04,870
We feel healthy,

636
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,371
we feel strong.

637
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,831
And we feel, you know, happy.

638
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,375
We feel like a tribe again.

639
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,397
( crackling thunder )

640
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,108
>> It's so sandy.

641
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,026
It's in my eyes,

642
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:36,944
it's in my mouth.

643
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:37,611
>> Is Tom's sand still up?

644
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,278
>> The sand is still up.

645
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,321
The wind is coming

646
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,405
directly at it.

647
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,575
>> You a little worried?

648
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,451
>> Yeah.

649
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,285
>> This isn't going to go

650
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,370
anywhere, there's no way.

651
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,831
I'd like to see 'em try.

652
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,541
( thunder crackling )

653
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:56,129
( whooping and laughter )

654
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,464
>> We had a, uh, a rainstorm

655
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,132
that kicked in, but now the

656
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,676
wind has picked up to a point.

657
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,927
I mean, this-this feels

658
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,011
like about a 40-mile-an-hour

659
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,345
wind right now.

660
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,348
It's really gusting hard.

661
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,848
Oh, God!

662
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,225
Are you, like, kidding me?

663
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,435
( rumbling thunder )

664
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,655
>> I don't know what the hell

665
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,823
that was, but it wasn't

666
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,324
paradise in Palau,

667
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:24,700
that's for sure.

668
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:29,162
>> Uh-uh.

669
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:29,871
>> That was.

670
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,290
That was absolute torture.

671
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,625
>> Last night was the first

672
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,252
night I think that I've ever had

673
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,129
where I felt so vulnerable.

674
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:37,587
I just felt very alone

675
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,007
and scared.

676
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,799
But, I mean, I ended up

677
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,508
getting through the night,

678
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,635
but it kind of just has

679
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,470
lingered on into the day.

680
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,478
>> Hang in there.

681
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,104
This is...

682
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,147
It's a bad day.

683
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,564
I feel the same way.

684
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,314
I'm so far away from

685
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,107
my family today that I'm down.

686
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,401
>> I feel like crap.

687
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,444
I'm just... I don't want

688
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,612
to get out of bed either.

689
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,156
It's, uh...

690
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,657
It's a bad place to be,

691
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,369
but let today be a bad day.

692
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,705
>> It's so hard.

693
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,289
>> It is hard.

694
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:12,956
It's very hard.

695
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,416
>> I'm so depleted.

696
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:14,916
>> You've already passed

697
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,627
your worst fear

698
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,839
of going home early.

699
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,132
You're going to make the merge.

700
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,216
I think you're going

701
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,134
to be on the jury,

702
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,011
and if most of us aren't

703
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,888
careful, we're going to be the

704
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,641
jury voting on you.

705
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,393
>> I don't have the strength.

706
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:33,643
>> You do.

707
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,480
>> I don't, I'm telling you.

708
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,482
>> Yeah, you don't have it

709
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,733
today, I agree with you.

710
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,692
You don't have it today,

711
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:44,821
but you have it.

712
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,365
>> Janu is losing it.

713
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,533
She gets totally caught up

714
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,160
in her head,

715
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,703
and she's like in the cocoon

716
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,454
in the hammock.

717
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,538
And everything is always

718
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,833
dramatic with Janu.

719
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,168
So I thought I was

720
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:58,668
the drama queen, but...

721
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,672
apparently not.

722
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,563
>> Rice?

723
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,816
>> No.

724
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,149
>> Is it heavy?

725
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,777
>> Yeah.

726
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,405
>> "This flag and box

727
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,282
belong to your enemy.

728
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,408
"Stop.

729
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,661
Your enemy has your flag

730
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:32,994
"and box also.

731
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,913
Stop.

732
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,331
"You must secure the flag

733
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,250
inside this box using only

734
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:38,834
"the ropes provided.

735
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,501
Stop.

736
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,586
"Make this box impenetrable.

737
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,546
Stop.

738
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,630
"Bring the secured box

739
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,549
to the challenge.

740
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,175
Stop."

741
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,718
So who knows how...?

742
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,178
>> Tie good knots.

743
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:50,804
>> Tree mail is a big old chest,

744
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,515
flag in it and a bunch of rope.

745
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,017
And we have to make it

746
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:56,685
impenetrable.

747
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,686
Well, I know a few things

748
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,478
about knots.

749
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,480
I've got a plan for you.

750
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,274
I learned this in the Navy.

751
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,150
They're not going to find a

752
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,151
knot.

753
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,403
You can tug on it all you want.

754
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,112
>> Oh.

755
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:07,529
>> Cool.

756
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,281
>> All right, James.

757
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,490
We're going to let you

758
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,325
do the tying, 'cause...

759
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,493
I'm not good at tying.

760
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,662
>> James says he was in the

761
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:15,871
Navy.

762
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,831
We spent a lot of time tying

763
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,167
this one knot that he says like

764
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:20,709
that when you pull on it,

765
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,668
that it's just going to get

766
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,086
real, real tighter.

767
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,421
He took the lead.

768
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,505
And he acted like he knew

769
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:25,881
what he was doing,

770
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,716
so, you know, I followed.

771
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,091
>> Wait a minute.

772
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,467
What the hell?

773
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:29,885
Where's the end?

774
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,387
>> Regulators!

775
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,138
>> I'm pretty sure

776
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,181
this is ours the taking,

777
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:38,351
so... we're gonna win.

778
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,330
>> JEFF: All right,

779
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,789
first things first.

780
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,918
Janu, give it up.

781
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,545
Immunity is back up for grabs.

782
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,671
All right, today's immunity

783
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,216
challenge began this morning

784
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,050
with your tree mail.

785
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:10,800
You each received

786
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,636
a footlocker and some rope.

787
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,094
Inside the footlocker

788
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,679
was the opposing tribe's flag.

789
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,224
You were instructed to use that

790
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,434
rope and make the footlocker

791
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,019
as impenetrable as you could.

792
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:21,561
The challenge continues.

793
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,022
Now you'll have 20 minutes

794
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,106
to swim out, retrieve

795
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,525
three bundles of lumber,

796
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,276
build a fortress

797
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,778
around this footlocker

798
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,363
to make it even more difficult

799
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,030
to get into.

800
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,782
After 20 minutes, we'll stop,

801
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,242
switch sides and each tribe

802
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,743
will attempt to undo

803
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,827
what the other tribe

804
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,496
has just done.

805
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,664
First tribe to release their

806
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,999
flag, secure it to the flag pole

807
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:43,750
and raise it to the top

808
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,669
wins immunity.

809
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,586
Koror, the four people

810
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,129
who sat out the last challenge

811
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,172
are in this one--

812
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,674
Jenn, Katie, Janu and Ian.

813
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,092
Everybody else take

814
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,051
a spot on the bench.

815
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,137
Let's go.

816
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,597
Here we go, for immunity.

817
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,475
Survivors ready?

818
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,311
Go!

819
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,817
Ulong sending three people out.

820
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,195
Koror sending just two.

821
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,282
Katie and Janu adding more

822
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:15,490
knots.

823
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,074
James getting a game plan for

824
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:16,741
Ulong.

825
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,077
Starts with keeping his toga on.

826
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,828
>> Ready?

827
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,496
Pull.

828
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,039
I got this one.

829
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,916
>> JEFF: Bobby Jon and Steph

830
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,334
coming back with the first load.

831
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,919
Ibrehem waiting in the middle.

832
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:28,837
I'll pass it to you.

833
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,337
>> Yeah.

834
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,171
Tell James to get close to

835
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:30,714
shore.

836
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,923
>> JEFF: Katie and Janu already

837
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,049
doing a lot of rope work.

838
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:33,425
The more knots,

839
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,175
the more difficult

840
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,261
it's going to be to untie.

841
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,850
James in no hurry at all.

842
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,934
Ulong coming back with

843
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,644
all three bundles at once.

844
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,189
James gives up on the toga.

845
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,650
Jenn back with a load for Koror.

846
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,735
You have 20 minutes

847
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,278
to get this thing

848
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,196
as impenetrable as possible.

849
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,489
Need to pick it up.

850
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,574
Ulong starting to work

851
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,827
on their fortress.

852
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,204
>> Good knot.

853
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,497
Make sure it's on the other end,

854
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,123
too.

855
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:05,874
>> JEFF: Steph getting

856
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,876
her teeth involved.

857
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,668
Ian back with the last load

858
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:14,466
of lumber for Koror.

859
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,050
Koror finally getting to work

860
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,801
on their fortress.

861
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,432
>> JEFF: Ten minutes down,

862
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,600
ten minutes to go.

863
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,853
>> Come on.

864
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,230
>> JEFF: Five minutes left.

865
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,024
Five minutes, we will switch

866
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,359
sides, and you will have to

867
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,902
untie what the other tribe has

868
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,112
done.

869
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,364
One minute left.

870
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:37,906
Ulong has used every piece

871
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,658
of rope they have.

872
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:43,745
Koror still has

873
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,082
quite a bit of rope left.

874
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,166
Ulong shoving every piece

875
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:48,917
of lumber they can.

876
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,670
Koror doing the same thing.

877
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,881
Two big disaster piles.

878
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:59,886
Five, four, three, two, one.

879
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,598
Everybody stop.

880
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,688
All right, on my "go,"

881
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,606
you will switch sides

882
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,857
and start untying.

883
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,942
First tribe to get

884
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,485
their flag free

885
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,528
and up the flag pole

886
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:16,861
wins immunity.

887
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,904
Be tigers, guys!

888
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,030
Survivors ready?

889
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,866
Go!

890
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,285
Now we're going to find out

891
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,662
who did a better job

892
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,663
of securing their footlocker.

893
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,705
No time limit here.

894
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,456
It is simply

895
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,462
the first tribe to finish.

896
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:34,879
Both tribes

897
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,048
making good progress.

898
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,550
Koror used a lot of wood

899
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,050
and a lot of knots.

900
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,887
Steph not impressed

901
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,638
with Koror's knots.

902
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,722
Ulong appears to have

903
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,224
a bit of a lead.

904
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,397
Ian takes care of the big rope

905
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,897
with no trouble.

906
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:53,940
>> But that's what's in it.

907
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,693
>> Keep doing that.

908
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,235
>> JEFF: Ulong starting to

909
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:01,656
slow down.

910
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:02,157
Koror getting closer.

911
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,160
>> TOM: Good, Koror!

912
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,286
>> There you go!

913
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:06,703
Yeah!

914
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,412
>> JEFF: Koror getting very

915
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:07,829
close.

916
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,956
Koror has their footlocker!

917
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,083
Come on.

918
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,376
( indistinct shouting )

919
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,002
Now you've got to untie it.

920
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,837
Ulong getting closer to

921
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,922
releasing their footlocker.

922
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,090
You guys need to keep moving.

923
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:19,799
Pull, pull, pull!

924
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,426
You're waltzing.

925
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,427
>> Slow and steady.

926
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,928
Just maintain that work.

927
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,512
>> JEFF: Both tribes working

928
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,389
on their footlocker.

929
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,015
This is where all your earlier

930
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:31,895
knot tying is going to pay off.

931
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,146
Ulong working together well.

932
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,814
Got to get that footlocker open.

933
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,608
Koror getting closer and closer.

934
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,151
Ulong with a lot of knots

935
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,027
to get undone,

936
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,404
but they're moving quickly.

937
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,740
>> Yeah!

938
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:44,324
>> JEFF: Ulong still working

939
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,241
strong.

940
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,826
You're still in it.

941
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,204
Koror getting closer and closer.

942
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,038
Ulong not giving up.

943
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,998
Immunity at stake.

944
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,958
Tribal Council awaits.

945
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,378
Somebody going home.

946
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,004
Koror literally down

947
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,839
to their last few knots.

948
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,425
>> GREGG: There you go!

949
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:06,554
>> JEFF: Koror has their

950
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,097
flag free.

951
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,974
Got to get it up the flag pole!

952
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,020
>> GREGG: There we are!

953
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,189
>> JEFF: Koror wins their fifth

954
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,608
straight immunity challenge!

955
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,401
All right, Ulong.

956
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:20,985
>> Oh, great job.

957
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,487
>> Nice.

958
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,071
>> Great job.

959
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,281
>> JEFF: Koror, you have yet to

960
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,283
lose an immunity challenge.

961
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,660
( whooping )

962
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,744
>> JEFF: No Tribal Council,

963
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,913
nobody going home.

964
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,415
Ulong, you have yet to win

965
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:34,999
an immunity challenge.

966
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:35,416
Next Tribal Council,

967
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,084
somebody going home.

968
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,919
This tribe will be

969
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,170
down to three.

970
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:39,837
Head on back.

971
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,380
See you at Tribal Council

972
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,674
tomorrow night.

973
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,628
>> We ended up losing

974
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,839
another immunity challenge.

975
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,174
Ulong hasn't won an immunity

976
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,427
challenge yet this whole game.

977
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,511
When it comes to

978
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,637
tonight at Tribal,

979
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,305
the only criteria

980
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,598
I'm going to go with

981
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,557
is whoever I think

982
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,558
has done the worst

983
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,601
out of all these

984
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,018
immunity challenges.

985
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,436
So it will most likely

986
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,689
be for James.

987
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,053
>> Ibrehem has overstayed

988
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,471
his welcome.

989
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,055
He was meant to go last time.

990
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:16,434
And by the grace of Allah,

991
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,060
he didn't go.

992
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:22,065
Well, my god says he is today.

993
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,529
I got two votes the other

994
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,697
night at Tribal Council,

995
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,157
and I know Angie was one.

996
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,992
but I thought Stephenie was the

997
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:33,993
other, but it wasn't Stephenie.

998
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,162
I'm thinking it was James,

999
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,206
and it was male handwriting.

1000
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,123
So I'm thinking James threw

1001
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,166
a dart at me and I'm going

1002
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,294
to throw one at him.

1003
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,025
>> She had to go.

1004
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,652
We couldn't lose you.

1005
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,362
I don't like to lie,

1006
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,447
but this was in the midst of we

1007
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,031
were deciding who we were

1008
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:12,990
gonna vote out tonight,

1009
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,242
so there's no way in hell I

1010
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,493
could have told him the truth.

1011
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,703
So I said, "I swear to God

1012
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,038
it wasn't me."

1013
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:19,372
I...

1014
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,082
It was a close one.

1015
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,000
>> Yeah, it was.

1016
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:23,418
>> I feel really bad

1017
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,002
lying about it,

1018
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:25,420
but if I would have

1019
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,879
told him the truth,

1020
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,296
they would have

1021
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:27,755
voted me off tonight.

1022
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,006
He would never

1023
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,174
be able to trust me.

1024
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,135
Either way, somebody's going to

1025
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,387
get their feelings hurt.

1026
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,347
>> Yeah.

1027
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,223
I swear to God, I voted

1028
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,101
for Angie, though.

1029
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,485
That's right.

1030
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,778
>> So I said to Bobby Jon,

1031
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,279
"Well, what if it's a tie?

1032
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,239
"Then what are we gonna do?

1033
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:53,948
We're gonna put

1034
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:54,449
our butts on the line?"

1035
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,284
And he assured me that

1036
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,201
he wanted to make an alliance

1037
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,579
with me that if I vote

1038
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,913
for James tonight, he wants

1039
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,458
to vote Ibrehem out next.

1040
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,001
Okay.

1041
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,210
I'll vote for James with you.

1042
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,462
>> Right.

1043
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,546
>> That's only if you promise

1044
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,297
if the three of us are still

1045
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,173
here, you and I will

1046
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,008
go to the end...

1047
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:12,925
>> We'll go to the end.

1048
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:13,384
and we'll vote Ib off.

1049
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,218
Yeah, we'll do that.

1050
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,970
'Cause I think we

1051
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:16,763
deserve it the best.

1052
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,513
>> Yeah, I know we do.

1053
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,264
>> Okay.

1054
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:18,848
Well, then, that's what we'll

1055
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,017
do.

1056
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,642
>> At this point in the game,

1057
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,644
I'm looking in the future,

1058
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,687
and I don't think

1059
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,980
I can get to the end

1060
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:26,314
with Ibrehem.

1061
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,690
So, it will definitely be

1062
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,568
me and Stephenie all the way to

1063
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,360
the end.

1064
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,445
If she's playing me,

1065
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,489
we'll find out,

1066
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:41,579
but I don't think she is.

1067
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,288
>> I'm between two sides

1068
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,331
right now.

1069
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,665
Because I can stick with James

1070
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,000
and it will be a tie,

1071
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,877
or go with Bobby Jon and Ib,

1072
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,379
vote off James,

1073
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,547
and then persuade Bobby Jon

1074
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,715
to stick with his word,

1075
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:57,053
and next time, Ib will go.

1076
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,096
I really don't know

1077
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,516
where I stand right now.

1078
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,801
>> JEFF: James?

1079
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,176
>> Yo.

1080
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,219
>> JEFF: You have not

1081
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,430
won a single immunity challenge.

1082
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,766
>> I tell you what...

1083
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,350
>> JEFF: Tell me something.

1084
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,269
When we hear the word

1085
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,312
"immunity," I think we

1086
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:48,980
subconsciously

1087
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,859
sabotage ourselves.

1088
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:53,985
>> JEFF: Well, let's talk about

1089
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:54,610
that.

1090
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,028
Do you guys think you gave 100%

1091
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:56,737
the last immunity challenge?

1092
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,614
I mean, I sat there and watched.

1093
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,282
>> Oh, yeah...

1094
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,117
>> JEFF: Steph and Bobby Jon

1095
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,534
swam out.

1096
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,785
Ibrehem took a leisurely stroll

1097
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,120
to the middle, doing what,

1098
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:04,579
I'm still not sure.

1099
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,622
And you sat back there

1100
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,373
messing with your skirt

1101
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,500
for two, three, four minutes.

1102
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,751
>> Wow.

1103
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,502
>> JEFF: That's when

1104
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,004
you lost the challenge.

1105
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:13,754
>> Well, that's not what held

1106
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,630
us up.

1107
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,924
>> JEFF: Ibrehem, last Tribal

1108
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:17,550
Council it looked like you were

1109
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,260
this close to being gone.

1110
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,261
Have you ever thought,

1111
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,346
these first few days out here,

1112
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,431
"Maybe I'm just not cut out for

1113
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,224
this game?

1114
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,309
>> Uh, actually, I've never

1115
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:26,726
thought like that.

1116
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,270
Um...

1117
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,063
It's really opened my eyes

1118
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,690
to what I can do, rather than

1119
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,566
what I can't handle.

1120
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,942
>> JEFF: James, if you hold

1121
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:35,818
the same criteria that

1122
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,986
you were holding to Ibrehem

1123
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,946
from last Tribal Council,

1124
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,197
do you think it's fair

1125
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,324
to base a vote simply on how

1126
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,867
you performed in a challenge?

1127
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,492
>> No, it's not fair to go ahead

1128
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,452
and just base my vote

1129
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,288
directly towards a challenge.

1130
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,540
It's camp life, personality.

1131
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,000
Do I get along with this person?

1132
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:51,584
Do I have personal feelings

1133
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,377
for this person? You know.

1134
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,754
>> JEFF: Steph, you guys

1135
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,005
have to be fighting for

1136
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:56,631
your own lives at this point.

1137
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,132
This tribe is almost done.

1138
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,175
>> We're almost out of numbers

1139
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,968
here.

1140
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:01,427
But the fact remains,

1141
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,261
that I want to win

1142
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,013
at least one immunity.

1143

I mean, I don't want to leave

1144
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,599
here being that tribe

1145
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,767
that never won immunity.

1146
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,101
That's like a disgrace.

1147
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:09,685
>> JEFF: Bobby Jon?

1148
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,394
>> Yes, sir.

1149
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,979
>> JEFF: Do you trust these

1150
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,606
people in your tribe?

1151
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,732
>> If you don't trust 'em,

1152
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,107
you shouldn't be

1153
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:15,566
in a tribe with them.

1154
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,484
You can't have a tribe

1155
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,485
if you don't trust people,

1156
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,111
and I do trust

1157
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:19,779
every one of them.

1158
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,446

1159
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,447
these three guys?

1160
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,449
>> I do.

1161
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,200
>> JEFF: Somebody here

1162
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,076
gives you their word,

1163
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:25,701
you can go to the bank with it?

1164
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,662
>> Absolutely.

1165
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,080
And, uh, when I get

1166
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,082
someone's word and I give them

1167
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:31,666
my word, I hope that they, you

1168
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,126
know, take it, and, so,

1169
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,921
I do trust them.

1170
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,172
>> JEFF: You three guys are all

1171
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:38,923
from, basically, the same part

1172
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:39,674
of the country, right?

1173
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,133
>> Pretty much.

1174
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:41,425
>> Alabama.

1175
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:41,717

1176
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,594
>> JEFF: Steph.

1177
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,637
A little bit of a concern

1178
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,304
that if you're looking

1179
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:45,763
for some way to divide

1180
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,765
this tribe, three guys, one

1181
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,641

1182
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,350

every time we come here.

1185
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,605
But, um, the fact remains

1186
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,356
that I've worked my butt off,

1187
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,525
and I've done the best I could,

1188
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,569
and I've done really well so

1189
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,654
far, so I just feel like

1190
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,030
it's really not my time yet,

1191
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:03,489
and I just hope that

1192
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,408
they see that, too.

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,840
that not many people

can say they have,

1293
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:15,634
