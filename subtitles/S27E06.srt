1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:05,296
>> Jeff: FROM DAY ONE, THE

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,256
RETURNING PLAYERS DOMINATED

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:06,631
THEIR LOVED ONES.

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,134
>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT COULD GET

5
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:09,551
ANY WORSE.

6
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,427
>> Jeff: SENDING THEM TO

7
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,095
TRIBAL COUNCIL, WEEK AFTER WEEK.

8
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,097
JOHN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

9
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,891
HE HAS THE RING AND HE'S UP WITH

10
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:17,058
IT.

11
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,935
BUT AFTER 13 DAYS, THE LOVED

12
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,228
ONES FINALLY WON A CHALLENGE.

13
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,188
HAYDEN SCORES.

14
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,189
TADHANA WINS THEIR FIRST

15
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,400
CHALLENGE OF THIS SEASON.

16
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,278
BACK AT CAMP, LAURA B WAS THE

17
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,654
EASY TARGET.

18
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,197
>> WHO DO YOU WANT YOU WOULD

19
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,866
WANT TO SEND HOME FIRST?

20
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:33,158
>> LAURA B.

21
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,327
>> Jeff: BUT ARAS HAD BIGGER

22
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:42,459
PLANS.

23
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,918
>> Jeff: THE TRIBAL COUNCIL,

24
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,336
GALANG WENT WITH ARAS AND TOOK

25
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,756
OUT ONE OF THEIR STRONGEST

26
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,465
COMPETITORS.

27
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:48,882
LAURAM.

28
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,593
HOPING LAURAM CAN BEAT BRAD AT

29
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,261
REDEMPTION ISLAND'S NEXT DUEL.

30
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,389
LAURA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

31
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,807
WILL GALANG GET BACK TO WINNING

32
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:02,061
OR WILL VOTING OUT LAURAM

33
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:02,312
BACKFIRE?

34
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:02,979
12 ARE LEFT.

35
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:23,249
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

36
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,250
>> THAT WAS BRUTAL.

37
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:24,876
>> YEAH.

38
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,419
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR

39
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,337
FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL, LAURA?

40
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,048
>> IT WAS SAD TO SEE SOMEBODY

41
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:30,423
VOTED OUT FIRST.

42
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,842
>> I'M GLAD IT WASN'T ME.

43
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,803
WE JUST GOT BACK FROM MY FIRST

44
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,386
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND I'M BACK.

45
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,221
I'M BACK HOME.

46
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,263
IT WASN'T ME.

47
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,683
MY NAME WAS WRITTEN DOWN, BUT WE

48
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,103
ALL HAD A UNANIMOUS VOTE TO VOTE

49
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,147
OUT LAURAM TONIGHT.

50
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,942
>> I FEEL LIKE AN OCTOPUS.

51
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,360
WE WERE EIGHT LEGS STRONG AND

52
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,986
NOW WE'RE DOWN A LEG.

53
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,279
>> RUPERT GAVE UP HIS GAME TO

54
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,113
LET ME PLAY.

55
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:54,697
I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE SO

56
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,199
PROUD OF ME.

57
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,200
>> SHE LOOK AT ANYBODY?

58
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,576
>> I DIDN'T LOOK AT HER.

59
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,202
>> SHE LOOKED ME DEAD IN THE EYE

60
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,247
LIKE, "YOU'RE A JERK.

61
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:02,497
OF.

62
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,082
>> WHY DID YOU LOOK AT HER?

63
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,875
>> WHY DID I LOOK AT HEAR?

64
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,627
I KIND OF WANTED TO SEE HER

65
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:07,919
EXPRESSION.

66
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,795
I WAS CURIOUS.

67
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,379
LAURAM LOOKED ME DEAD IN THE

68
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,340
EYE, AS SHE REALIZED IT WAS HER,

69
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,759
AND SHE WAS VERY ANGRY, AND I

70
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,343
GOT MY FINGERS CROSSED THAT

71
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,720
SHE'S GOING TO TAKE THE NOBLE

72
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,765
APPROACH TO REDEMPTION ARENA,

73
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,517
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, REDEMPTION

74
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,436
ARENA HAS BECOME A PLACE TO

75
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,020
DESMIMP PEOPLE'S CHARACTER.

76
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,730
>> DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO

77
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,398
GET THE RAMIFICATIONS OF ALL

78
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,732
THIS TOMORROW?

79
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,569
>> WHAT IS SHE GOING TO SAY?

80
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,236
SHE HADERATE WAYS OF THE WAY

81
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,280
THAT VOTE WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

82
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:35,530
TONIGHT.

83
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,323
SHE KIND OF DID HERSELF IN.

84
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:37,949
UNFORTUNATELY, IT LOOKS LIKE I'M

85
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:38,366
THE RING LEADER.

86
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,994
THAT'S NEVER A GOOD THING.

87
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,412
YOU NEVER WANT TO BE AT THE TOP.

88
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,873
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF

89
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:45,498
THAT POSITION.

90
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,041
PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE

91
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,129
OTHER, TREAD CAREFULLY, I

92
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,382
SUPPOSE.

93
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,425
WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE

94
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,219
TO TALK ONE ON ONE ABOUT ARAS.

95
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,222
I FEEL OKAY WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.

96
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,892
>> UH-HUH.

97
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,185
>> BUT IF WE LOSE, THERE'S A

98
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,437
GOOD CHANCE THAT'S THE LAST TIME

99
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,187
BEFORE THE MERGE.

100
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:08,521
>> YEAH.

101
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,274
>> THE SECOND HE GOES WITH

102
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,359
VYTAS, I'M THINKING HE THINKS

103
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,110
I'M A THREAT.

104
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:14,360
>> RIGHT.

105
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,737
>> WHICH IS DANGEROUS.

106
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,823
THAT MEANS WHEN HE GET TO VYTAS,

107
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,950
HE'LL BE LIKE, "TYSON IS

108
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:21,200
TROUBLE."

109
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,452
>> YOU FIGURE ARAS CAN MAKE A

110
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:22,660
MOVE.

111
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,121
>> AND DOES THAT SCARE JEW OF

112
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:25,330
COURSE.

113
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,998
>> SO WE'RE BOTH KIND OF ON THE

114
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:27,707
SAME PAGE WITH HIM?

115
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,291
>> RIGHT.

116
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,667
>> I DO LIKE ARAS.

117
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,919
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

118
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,961
HE'S FUNNY.

119
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,256
HE'S A LITTLE OUT THERE ON HIS

120
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,966
ZEN-TYPE BELIEFS BECAUSE I HAVE

121
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,426
ZERO BELIEFS-- EXCEPT FOR MAGIC.

122
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,427
I BELIEVE IN MAGIC.

123
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,054
IT'S AWESOME.

124
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,805
BUT PEOPLE LIKE ARAS, THEY DO.

125
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,393
THAT'S THE TRICKY PART, WHEN TO

126
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,437
DETHRONE KING ARAS.

127
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,481
IF WE LOSE THE CHALLENGE WOULD

128
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,900
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WRITING HIS

129
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:54,150
NAME DOWN?

130
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,818
>> LESS AS IT GOES ON.

131
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,153
ARAS IS A LEADER RUNNING THE

132
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,696
SHOW, AND TYSON BROUGHT UP GOOD

133
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,364
POINTS THAT WE MAY ONLY HAVE ONE

134
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,407
MORE CHALLENGE LEFT BEFORE THE

135
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,576
MERGER, AND THAT MAY BE OUR LAST

136
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,203
CHANCE TO GET RID OF ARAS.

137
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:05,745
>> IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK

138
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:05,954
ABOUT.

139
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,330
IF YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH

140
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,331
HIM, I'M GOING TO FEEL GREAT

141
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,041
WITH HIM, TOO, OR I'M GOING TO

142
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,626
TRY TO FEEL GREAT WITH HIM.

143
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,585
I WANT TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

144
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,754
BECAUSE I'M IN WITH THIS YOU.

145
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,422
>> I ABSOLUTELY SCREWED UP IN MY

146
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,716
FIRST SEASON BEING A CHESS PIECE

147
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,343
AND THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

148
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,681
JUST TO BE LOOKED AT AS A PLAYER

149
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
WHO PLAYED IT TWICE AND DIDN'T

150
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:26,975
PLAY.

151
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:27,725
I DON'T WANT THAT.

152
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,310
I THINK THE NEW POWER COUPLE OUT

153
00:04:29,394 --> 00:05:02,719
HERE IS ME AND TYSON.

154
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:09,308
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

155
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,768
TADHANA GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK

156
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,313
AT THE NEW GALANG TRIBE.

157
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,232
LAURA M. VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

158
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:16,691
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

159
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,484
WE'RE NOW BRING IN THE

160
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,946
COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S DUEL.

161
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:32,457
JOHN, BRAD, AND LAURAM.

162
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,458
SO CIERA, EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE THE

163
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,753
ROOKIE, YOU SURVIVED FOUR TRIBAL

164
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,045
COUNCILS.

165
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:37,628
YOUR MOM, THE VETERAN, DIDN'T

166
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,671
SURVIVE ONE.

167
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,631
>> IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE ALL DAY

168
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,176
I'VE HAD A REALLY WEIRD FEELING.

169
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,844
I JUST-- I JUST KIND OF KNEW.

170
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,138
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

171
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:47,722
>> Jeff: DOES THAT SURPRISE

172
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,390
YOU, LAURA, THAT SHE MIGHT

173
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,768
ACTUALLY HAVE FELT SOMETHING,

174
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,268
SOME ENERGY?

175
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:52,643
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

176
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,104
THAT'S MY BABY.

177
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,022
SHE CAME FROM ME.

178
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,191
SHE'S PART OF ME.

179
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,067
WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

180
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,235
WE'RE STILL IN THIS.

181
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,236
>> Jeff: ONE OF THE TWISTS

182
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,488
THIS SEASON IS THAT IF YOU HAVE

183
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,239
A LOVED ONE THAT IS ON

184
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,949
REDEMPTION ISLAND, YOU CAN SWAP

185
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,158
SPOTS--

186
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,993
>> THERE'S NO WAY SHE'S SWAPPING

187
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:09,535
WITH ME.

188
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,453

00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,238
BUT IF YOU COME IN AND THINK

564
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,116
EVERYBODY CRACKS OPEN A COCONUT

565
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:14,908
WHENEVER THEY WANT.

566
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,535
EVERYBODY CAN EAT A BANANA

567
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:16,952
WHENEVER THEY WANT.

568
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,245
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FAIR.

569
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,622
WANT TO SEE HOW FAST I CAN DRINK

570
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:20,789
THIS?

571
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,207
IT'S DEFINITELY A GOAL TO EAT

572
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,376
AND STEAL AS MUCH FOOD AS I CAN

573
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,169
FROM THIS TRIBE, AND I'M GOING

574
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,838
TO KEEP EATING THAT FOOD TILL

575
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,630
IT'S GONE.

576
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,381
OH, IT'S TOO MUCH.

577
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,924
YOU DO HAVE TO DO A CERTAIN

578
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,386
AMOUNT OF WORK OR APPEAR TO BE

579
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,180
WORKING SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T

580
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,806
JUST HATE YOU AS THE LAZY GUY.

581
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,223
>> YEAH!

582
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,266
ALL RIGHT!

583
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,642
THANK YOU.

584
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,311
>> I DON'T THINK I'M PAINTED AS

585
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,979
THE LADY GUY YET.

586
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,355
BECAUSE AFTER I CRACK A COCONUT

587
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,357
AND DRINK HALF OF IT, I PASS THE

588
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,859
REST AROUND TO THE OTHER FIVE

589
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,277
PEOPLE TO SHARE SO THAT'S KIND

590
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,737
OF GENEROUS FOR ME TO DO.

591
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,363
I'M GOING TO HIT ALL THAT FOOT

592
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,115
FOODLIKE A ONE-MAN WRECKING

593
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,324
BALL.

594
00:17:55,407 --> 00:18:02,372
( LAUGHTER )

595
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,415
>> WELCOME TO OUR HOME.

596
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,250
THIS IS OUR HOUSE.

597
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,004
>> THIS IS KATIE.

598
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:09,171
VYTAS.

599
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:13,050
>> HI.

600
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,009
>> THIS IS MONICA.

601
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:14,426
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

602
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,470
IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO HAVE KATIE.

603
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,055
THIS IS A CREAM COME TRUE.

604
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:18,806
THAT FIRST NIGHT I THOUGHT THIS

605
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,182
MIGHT BE THE ONLY NIGHT SHE AND

606
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:20,557
I SPEND TOGETHER.

607
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,227
AND HERE WE ARE TOGETHER AGAIN.

608
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,313
AND TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS GAME

609
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,942
WITH HER AND PLAY AS A TEAM IS

610
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:30,818
JUST WONDERFUL.

611
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,111
BECAUSE NOW, YOU SWITCH.

612
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,571
I'VE BEEN PLAYING WATER, AND NOW

613
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,366
I CAN PLAY BLOOD.

614
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:37,533
>>.

615
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,243
>> I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED

616
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:39,701
WITH WHAT HAPPENED.

617
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,453
I MEAN, I CAME FROM A PLACE

618
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,329
WHERE I WAS PRETTY MUCH IN

619
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,205
CONTROL OF MY DESTINY TO A PLACE

620
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,457
WHERE I HAVE ZERO CONTROL.

621
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,166
I MEAN, YOU COULD SAY, YEAH, TWO

622
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,086
OF US CAME OVER TO A GROUP OF

623
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:49,294
FOUR.

624
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,212
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE BECAUSE

625
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,881
ONE OF US THAT CAME OVER IS THE

626
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,132
DAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE FOUR.

627
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,301
SO YOU TAKE KATIE WITH TINA,

628
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,803
THERE'S ME AND THERE'S FIVE

629
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,011
GIRLS.

630
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:02,599
YOU KNOW, I'M THE ODD MAN OUT.

631
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,143
>> I THINK WE STICK TOGETHER IN

632
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,687
OUR TRIBE OF FOUR, THE ORIGINAL

633
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:06,895
GALANG.

634
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:07,312
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

635
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,106
>> I MEAN, YEAH, IT SOUND GOOD.

636
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,275
>> I MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH TINA,

637
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,194
MONICA, LAURA B, AND KATIE, BUT

638
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,362
MONICA WILL NOT STOP

639
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:15,696
STRATEGIZING.

640
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,405
SHE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

641
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,239
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

642
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,282
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

643
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,534
I HAVEN'T EYE HAVEN'T MADE

644
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:20,742
THOSE--

645
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,829
>> IF WE WERE TO LOSE, IT WOULD

646
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,413
BE MAYBE VYTAS?

647
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,623
>> WHEN YOU HAVE AN ALLIANCE,

648
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,791
DON'T OVER-STRATEGIZE.

649
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,334
ALL THAT DOES IS PUT HE'S HEATON

650
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,043
YOUR BACK.

651
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,254
YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY

652
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:32,546
"SURVIVOR?"

653
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:37,467
SHUT IT.

654
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,595
>> LOOK AT ALL THE CENTIPEDES

655
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,804
COMING OUT OF THAT THING.

656
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,763
ALL THE DANGEROUS ANIMALES WERE

657
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,389
IN THAT LOG.

658
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,473
>> THIS THAT LOG.

659
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,266
WE KILLED ALL OF THEM.

660
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,809
>> ARE YOU GUYS HUNGRY?

661
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,768
SHOULD WE DO SOME RICE.

662
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:46,977
>> YES.

663
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,228
>> WE'RE ALWAYS HUNGRY.

664
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:48,854
>> I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW

665
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,814
TO RUN YOUR HOUSEHOLD, GUYS.

666
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,026
>> BUT YOU FEED YOUR GUESTS

667
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:54,401
IMMEDIATELY.

668
00:19:54,484 --> 00:20:00,866
YOU'RE BEING RUDE.

669
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:06,496
>>

670
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,248
>> BEFORE THE TRIBE SWAP,

671
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,876
GERVASE AND I HAD DECIDED THAT

672
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,460
GETTING RID OF ARAS MIGHT BE A

673
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,920
WISE MOVE.

674
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,338
SO NOW I JUST MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

675
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,632
HE'S BOSSING EVERYBODY AROUND,

676
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,716
TAKING CHARGE AND DOING WHATEVER

677
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:24,097
HE WANTS.

678
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,600
>> YOU KNOW, I'LL APOLOGIZE FOR

679
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,434
HIM CONSTANTLY.

680
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,478
I'M LIKE, "SORRY ABOUT ARAS.

681
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,812
HE KIND OF DOESN'T KNOW.

682
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:36,109
HE'S SOCIALLY UNAWARE, AN" AND E

683
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,527
SURE PEOPLE KNOW BETWEEN HE AND

684
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,864
I, HE'S THE ONE IN CHARGE.

685
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,157
>> YOU NEED MORE SUNSHINE.

686
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,158
>> THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

687
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,326
BUT I WAS LIKE I ALREADY CUT

688
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,371
HALF OF IT.

689
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:56,672
>> I'M OUT HERE TO PLAY AND I

690
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,757
HAVE TO USE MY BRAIN.

691
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,844
SO HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A LITTLE

692
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,554
SMALLER ON ME AND LARGE OR ARAS.

693
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:30,080
EVERYTHING YOU'VE GIVEN US AND
PLEASE BLESS THOSE WHO ARE NOT

694
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,041
AS FORTUNATE AS WE ARE.
AS OF RIGHT NOW, WE ARE A SOLID

695
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,627
TRIBE AND WE'RE GOING TO DO VERY
WELL TOGETHER AND PLEASE LOOK

696
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,715
AFTER OUR LOVED ONES WHO ARE ON
THE OTHER SIDE IN YOUR NAME,

697
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,882
AMEN.
>> IT IS ME AND FIVE WOMEN ON

698
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,593
THE NEW GALANG TRIBE, AND
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PLAY FOR ME

699
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,556
COMING IN HERE.
BASICALLY, THESE WOMEN HAVE

700
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,558
BONDED SO I'M AT THE MERCY OF
THEM.

701
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,436
>> I WAS TRYING TO SAY
MISUNFORTUNATE-- BUT--

702
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,106
>> LESS FORTUNATE.
>> LESS FORTUNATE.

703
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,734
YOU KNEW WHAT I MEANT.
>> PINT OF LANGUAGE IS TO GET

704
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,069
THE IDEA ACROSS.
I GOT THE IDEA.

705
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,030
I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT
WOMEN.

706
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:07,743
BUT I DO KNOW THAT WHEN I'M A
LITTLE BIT VULNERABLE WITH

707
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,620
WOMEN, IT GOES A LONG WAY.
ME OPENING UP AND LETTING THEM

708
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,582
KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY PAST
COULD KEEP ME AROUND.

709
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,085
>> HOW LONG WERE YOU IN JAIL?
>> I DID EIGHT MONTHS MY YEAR.

710
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,421
>> HOW SCARED WERE YOU?
>> SO SCARED.

711
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,423
OH, MY GOD.
I'M THIS LITTLE 19-YEAR-OLD KID

712
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,426
ON THE WEST SIDE.
EAST L.A., I KILLED THREE

713
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,553
PEOPLE.
I ROBBED FOUR BAEKS.

714
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:31,433
AND I'M LIKE I TRIED TO GET
MONEY FROM A LAELD FOR DRUGS.

715
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,812
>> HEARING VYTAS ADMIT HE HAD A
REALLY HARD TIME WITH A HEROINE

716
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,608
ADDICTION IS REALLY POWERFUL.
THAT'S A NEAT PART OF A MAN THAT

717
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,568
CAN SHARE HIS EMOTIONS AND
FEELINGS.

718
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:48,450
IT REMINDS ME OF RUPERT.
>> ARAS HAD SO MUCH RESENTMENT.

719
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,951
I ABANDON HIMAISE TEENAGER.
I WASN'T THERE.

720
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,245
>> RIGHT.
>> FOR THE LAST 13 YEARS NOW

721
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,582
IT'S BEEN US TRYING TO GET OUR
RELATIONSHIP BACK BECAUSE I LOVE

722
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,583
HIM.
MORE THAN ANYTHING, THAT'S WHO I

723
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,126
WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH.

724
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,587
ARAS IS SMATTER THAN ME.
ARAS IS MORE PHYSICALLY GIFTED

725
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,673
THAN ME.
ARAS IS AMAZING.

726
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,803
>> DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.
>> I'M NOT SELLING MYSELF SHORT.

727
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,389
>> I AM SO ENJOYING GETTING TO
KNOW YOU.

728
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,142
DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.
>> I LOVE VYTAS.

729
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,520
I FEEL CONNECTED ALREADY.
I HAVE TO KEEP MY HEART OUT OF

730
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:20,607
IT.
I LIKE HIM A LOT, BUT VYTAS AND

731
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:30,659
ARAS COULD TAKE THIS WHOLE GAME.
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

732
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:50,512
ARAS COULD TAKE THIS WHOLE GAME.
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

733
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,807
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO YOUR FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

734
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,641
AS NEW TRIBES?
>> YES.

735
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:59,563
>> YEAH!
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

736
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:05,193
TAKE BACK THE IMMUNITY EYEOL.
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

737
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,655
FOR GRABS.
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, ONE PAIR

738
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,701
FROM EACH TRIBE WILL RACE OUT TO

00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,173
THERE AND IT'S ALL GUYS.

907
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,341
GUYS.

908
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,635
WE ALL KNOW WHY IT'S A GOOD IDEA

909
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,678
TO STAY WITH THE PLAN.

910
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,179
LET ALL THE GIRLS STICK TOGETHER

911
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,972
AND GET RID OF THE GUY.

912
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:55,598
KAT'S ALREADY WANTING TO SWITCH

913
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,393
THAT UP AND SEND MONICA HOME.

914
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,602
KAT'S LOYALTY, I DON'T FEEL

915
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,145
LIKE, IS AS STRONG, AND THAT'S

916
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,397
JUST INFORMATION THAT NEEDS TO

917
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,815
BE THROUGHOUT FOR EVERYBODY TO

918
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,360
KNOW.

919
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:11,948
>> REALLY?

920
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,157
>> YES.

921
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:13,950
>> WHY?

922
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,952
>> BECAUSE THE STRA STRATEGY.

923
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,620
SHE SAYS SHE WORRIES ABOUT YOU

924
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,371
STRATEGIZING TOO MUCH.

925
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,790
>> THAT IS A LITTLE WORRISOME,

926
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,625
ESPECIALLY IF WE MADE A PACT

927
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,293
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE OUT VYTAS--

928
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,169
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

929
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,338
IF WE HAD A GIRLS' ALLIANCE AND

930
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,756
SHE'S ALREADY SAYING I WANT

931
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,049
MONICA GONE, HOW DO YOU KNOW

932
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,342
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET TO THE

933
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,260
OTHER SIDE AND SHE SAYS I WANT

934
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,386
TINA GONE.

935
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:33,636
>> I KNOW.

936
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,930
>> I WAS TOTALLY ON BOARD THAT

937
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,432
IT WOULD BE VYTAS, BUT IF I'M

938
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,725
HEARING THAT KAT'S GUNNING FOR

939
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,145
ME, I NEED TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR

940
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:47,233
MONICA.

941
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,693
>> JUST NOW?

942
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,318
>> UH-HUH.

943
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,820
>> WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IF

944
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,196
WE SHOULD TELL VYTAS THAT HE'S

945
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,198
GETTING ELIMINATED OR NOT.

946
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,366
>> RIGHT.

947
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,784
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THAT YOU

948
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,952
SAID ABOUT ME?

949
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:01,497
>> NO, NOT TO TEEN ANNO.

950
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,332
>> NO.

951
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,250
>> I HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU BROUGHT

952
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,877
MY NAME UP.

953
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,544
>> FROM WHO?

954
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,170
>> PEOPLE HAVE SAID YOU HAVE

955
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,796
SAID MY NAME.

956
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,922
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

957
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:10,256
TALKING ABOUT.

958
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,717
>> I KNOW MY NAME'S BEEN THROWN

959
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,468
OUT THERE.

960
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,011
I'VE ASKED HER TO TELL ME THE

961
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:15,470
TRUTH, AND SHE WON'T.

962
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,056
IF SOMEBODY IS GUNNING FOR ME,

963
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,348
WHICH I CAN FEEL IT.

964
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,643
I CAN SENSE IT IN KAT THAT SHE

965
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,811
IS, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

966
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,437
KEEP THEM AROUND.

967
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,229
>> I WANT TO GO ALL GIRL STRONG.

968
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,190
I DON'T NEED TO CONTINUE TO

969
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,692
COMMUNICATE ABOUT ALLT ALL THE

970
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,234
TIME.

971
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,736
LIKE-- MONICA'S VERY DANGEROUS,

972
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,654
BECAUSE WHEN SHE STRATEGIZES

973
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,406
PEOPLE ACTUALLY MIGHT LISTEN TO

974
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:35,573
HER.

975
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,324
SO MY BACK'S UP AGAINST THE

976
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:36,491
WALL.

977
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,910
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN

978
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,827
TO STAY HERE AND THAT'S IT.

979
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,120
>> I'M SORRY.

980
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,163
>> SO IF VYTAS HAS TO GO HOME

981
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,998
TONIGHT, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO

982
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,457
GO HOME.

983
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,250
THAT'S HOW THE NATURE OF THE

984
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:46,501
GAME GOES.

985
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,710
>> YOU KNOW WHO, RIGHT?

986
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,962
>> NOT FOR SURE.

987
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:50,171
STILLV?

988
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:50,421
>> YEAH.

989
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,215
>> OKAY.

990
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,675
>> AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME.

991
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,927
>> OR NOT ME.

992
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,263
>> I TEACH MY KIDS DO UNTO

993
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,057
OTHERS AS YOU WOULD WANT THIM TO

994
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,682
DO UNTO YOU.

995
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,478
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IN "SURVIVOR

996
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,813
"I FIGURED IT OUT.

997
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,690
IT'S DO UNTO OTHERS BEFORE THEY

998
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,274
DO UNTO YOU.

999
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,193
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT KAT?

1000
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,444
IF SOMEBODY IS IT GUNNING FOR ME

1001
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,987
I'M WRITING HER NAME DOWN.

1002
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,155
I'M TRYING TO CORAL AND PERSUADE

1003
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,199
EVERYBODY IN THIS TRIBE TO DO

1004
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,700
THE SAME THING.

1005
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,368
>> I THINK THE BEST THING IS FOR

1006
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,577
KAT TO GO.

1007
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,871
>> WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION

1008
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,250
TONIGHT WHO DOES IT MAKE SENSE

1009
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,669
TO SEND, CAPT OR VYTAS?

1010
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,294
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO STAY

1011
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,005
WITH THE PLAN, WHICH IS TO VOTE

1012
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:33,631
FOR VYTAS.

1013
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,174
BUT KAT'S LOYALTY, I'M NOT SO

1014
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,634
SURE ABOUT THAT.

1015
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,261
WHO SHOULD GO?

1016
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,470
HONESTLY, IT IS A COIN TOSS.

1017
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,265
IT IS 50-50.

1018
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,082
>> Jeff: SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

1019
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,125
THE TRIBE SWITCH.

1020
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:09,667
KAT, NEW GROUP OF PEOPLE.

1021
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,795
WHO'S NOT GETTING ALONG?

1022
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,421
>> I GUESS IT'S JUST BETWEEN

1023
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,338
MONICA AND I.

1024
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,757
I SAW MONICA WAS KIND OF DOWN,

1025
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,384
SO I JUST WENT OVER TO ASK HER

1026
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,302
HOW SHE'S DOING.

1027
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,344
AND THE CONVERSATION DIDN'T END

1028
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,346
UP AS WELL AS I THOUGHT IT

1029
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:22,555
WOULD.

1030
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,848
>> Jeff: MONICA WHAT WAS THE

1031
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,099
CONVERSATION ABOUT, FROM YOUR

1032
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:25,308
SIDE?

1033
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,934
>> JUST ABOUT THE GAME.

1034
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,768
AND TRUST ISSUES.

1035
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,854
I MEAN, ALL I'M LOOKING FOR IS A

1036
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,272
LITTLE BIT OF TRUST.

1037
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,941
AND YOU WANT IT SO MUCH FROM

1038
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,027
THIS YOUNG LADY BECAUSE I

1039
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,611
GENUINELY AM CHEERING FOR HER.

1040
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,363
AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT.

1041
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,157
>> MONICA, THIS SHOULDN'T BE ANY

1042
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,074
YOU AND I RIGHT NOW.

1043
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:42,658
>> I UNDERSTAND.

1044
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,452
>> LIKE, I GENUINELY LOVE

1045
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,871
MONICA, AND I LOVE THESE GIRLS.

1046
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:47,455
LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE THEIR BACK.

1047
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,665
AND IF WE ALL MAKE IT TO THE

1048
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,083
MERGE, I FEEL LIKE THAT WE

1049
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,376
SHOULD ALWAYS STICK TOGETHER.

1050
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,128
NO OFFENSE.

1051
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:54,420
NO OFFENSE.

1052
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,005
>> Jeff: THAT WILL ONLY HAPPEN

1053
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,506
IF TONIGHT VYTAS IS VOTED OUT.

1054
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,592
>> JEFF KAT'S GOING TO WRITE MY

1055
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,468
NAME DOWN TONIGHT PROBABLY.

1056
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,636
AND I FEEL FOR THEIR

1057
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,637
RELATIONSHIP, BUT TRUST IN THIS

1058
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,930
GAME IS STICKING WITH YOUR

1059
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,181
ALLIANCE NO MATTER WHAT.

1060
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:05,806
SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE THE ONE

1061
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,516
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK WHEN I

1062
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,768
FEEL LIKE I HAVE ESTABLISHED

1063
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,894
SOME PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS

1064
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,186
AROUND HERE.

1065
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,230
>> JEFF, I'VE ESTABLISHED

1066
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:12,647
RELATIONSHIPS HERE.

1067
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,481
I HAVE ALL OF THEIR BACKS AND

1068
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,482
THEY KNOW IT.

1069
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,484
MONICA, YOU KNOW I ALWAYS HAVE

1070
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,985
YOUR BACK.

1071
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,611
>> OH, KAT.

1072
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,280
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING MORE

1073
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,449
THAN I WANT TO DO THAN TRUST YOU

1074
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:27,495
AND I SERVED IT UP ON A SILVER

1075
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,789
PLATTER A FEW TIMES TRUSTING.

1076
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,791
AND IN THE END, I EVEN HEARD

1077
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,376
YOU'VE THROWN MY NAME AROUND.

1078
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,335
>> Jeff: KAT, DO YOU THINK

1079
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,211
YOU'RE GOING HOME TONIGHT?

1080
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,253
>> I HOPE I DON'T.

1081
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,047
I WANT TO STAY.

1082
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:38,631
AND YOU GUYS KNOW HOW MUCH I

1083
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,340
WANT TO STAY.

1084
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,468
PLEASE, BECAUSE I WILL DO

1085
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:42,718
ANYTHING.

1086
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,762
>> Jeff: WHO SHOULD BE GOING

1087
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:44,971
HOME?

1088
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:45,596
>> I FEEL LIKE THE WOMEN SHOULD

1089
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,099
STICK TOGETHER LIKE OUR PLAN WAS

1090
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,227
FROM THE GET-GO, AND VOTE OUT

1091
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:51,435
VYTAS.

1092
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,854
>> JEFF, I HEAR A LOT OF "I'M

1093
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,105
SORPRY."

1094
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,272
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY MADE SOME

1095
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,315
MISTAKES IN BUILDING TRUST WITH

1096
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,359
HER PARTNERS, BUT I HAVEN'T MADE

1097
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:58,859
ANYONE TO ANYONE HERE--

1098
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,945
>> WE WON'T KNOW THAT.

1099
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,114
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE

1100
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,407
FIVE STRONG GOING INTO THE MERGE

1101
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,450
IF ONE PERSON HAS DEMONSTRATED

1102
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,952
ALREADY THAT THEY CAN'T BE

1103
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,202
TRUSTED.

1104
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:08,619
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1105
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,038
AND JUST BECAUSE VYTAS COMES IN

1106
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,622
AND HE'S GENUINE TO EVERYBODY

1107
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,792
FOR 24 HOURS, WE DON'T KNOW

1108
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,292
ANYTHING.

1109
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,711
BUT YOU DO KNOW I WILL STAY

1110
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,795
HERE, AND I LOVE THESE PEOPLE,

1111
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,714
AND THEY KNOW THAT.

1112
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,340
>> Jeff: TINA, ONE SIDE SAYS

1113
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,134
STICK WITH YOUR ALLIANCE, DON'T

1114
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,427
LET THE OUTSIDERS IN.

1115
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,469
THE OTHER SAYS TWO NEW PEOPLE?

1116
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,512
CHANCE TO BREAK THINGS UP.

1117
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,140
>> YEAH, WELL FOR ME IT'S A

1118
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,057
LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT BECAUSE I

1119
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,517
HAVE A LOVED ONE OVER HERE NOW.

1120
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,311
THAT PUTS A WHOLE NEW DYNAMIC ON

1121
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:34,603
THINGS.

1122
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,647
AND SO, I HAVE TO MAKE MY

1123
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,440
DECISION BASED ON WHAT I THINK

1124
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,484
IS GOING TO GET ME FURTHER

1125
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,528
TONIGHT AND POSSIBLY IN THE

1126
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:42,737
FUTURE.

1127
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,530
>> Jeff: SO, VYTAS, HOW DO YOU

1128
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,866
MAKE SURE IT ISN'T YOU TONIGHT?

1129
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,576
>> ALL I CAN REALLY DO IS COME

1130
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,204
IN HERE AND JUST BE OPEN, BE A

1131
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,581
LITTLE BIT VULNERABLE,UN, SHOW

1132
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,749
THE PERSON THEY REALLY AM.

1133
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,082
AND THAT'S IT.

1134
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,543
THE REST IS LEFT FOR THEM TO

1135
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,544
JUDGE AND SAY OKAY, DO WE BUY

1136
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,588
THIS GUY?

1137
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,380
CAN WE TRUST HIM?

1138
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,383
OR DO WE JUST STICK WITH WHAT WE

1139
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:04,592
HAVE?

1140
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,510
>> Jeff: KAT, WE'RE JUST GO

1141
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,095
BTO VOTE.

1142
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,096
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ON YOUR

1143
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,265
MIND JAI LOVE YOU GUYS.

1144
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,392
FROM DAY ONE I HAVE HAD ALL YOUR

BACKS EXPWI ALWAYS WILL.

1146
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,519
>> Jeff: VYTAS YOU'RE SHAKE

1147
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,896
YOUR HEAD.

1148
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:17,563
>> I'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT HER

1149
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,066
NOT HAVING PEOPLE'S BACK.

1150
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,233
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1151
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:21,859
>> SHE SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY WITH

1152
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,237
HER BACK UP AGAINST THE WALL I

1153
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,238
GOT CAUGHT THROWING PEOPLE'S

1154
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,031
NAMES OUT.

1155
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,407
PLEASE, I WILL NEVER DO THAT

1156
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,575
AGAIN.

1157
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,327
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1158
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:31,827
MONICA, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1159
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,454
>> I HAVE BEEN THERE.

1160
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,497
CAN I PLEASE FINISH.

1161
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,248
IT SUCKS TO MAKE MISTAKES.

1162
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,292
>> PLEASE STAY TOGETHER, GUYS.

1163
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,461

>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1166
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:43,547
