2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,130
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,920
Brice, the tribe has spoken.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,230
In the Beauty tribe, 
Morgan lost his only ally .

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,810
and found himself facing 
an alliance of four.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,890
It is very likely 
that I will leave next.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,100
I'll have to save 
myself, I guess.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,570
In the Muscle tribe,

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,350
winning was becoming routine.

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,000
The Muscle Tribe succeeds!

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,900
But that did not prevent 
divisions from appearing.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,790
I want Cliff gone.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,650
I can do it. 
Trust me.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,940
During the last 
immunity test...

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,320
Spencer, it goes in and it comes out!

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,140
The Intelligence tribe 
perpetuates its tradition…

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,300
She is there! Muscle wins!

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,190
...of defeat.

19
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,310
The Intelligence tribe 
once again goes to the council.

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,570
- And at the tribal council... 
- At this rate,

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,540
none of you will be there at the end.

22
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,490
- Nope. 
- ...their dilemma was clear.

23
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,640
Do we keep the strongest 
to the trials, Spencer?

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,810
Or do we choose 
the one who has proven her loyalty?

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,070
Finally, 
they chose strength.

26
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,930
J'Tia, bring me your torch.

27
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,040
J'Tia, the tribe has spoken.

28
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,030
There are fourteen left, 
who will be eliminated tonight?

29
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,750
It's a sign.

30
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,170
Our fire is still burning.

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,270
- Oh my God. 
- Okay, hugs?

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,700
- To both of you. 
- It was really intense.

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,590
- Oh my God. 
- I've never been so nervous.

34
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,720
I couldn't 
be happier

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,770
to always be in the game.

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,270
I was thinking of leaving today.

37
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,150
This game changes in an instant. 
Now I'm going back.

38
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,550
It's like a roller coaster

39
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,500
and I'm glad I haven't 
fallen off the wagon yet.

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,470
I don't know 
what made your decision.

41
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,690
I can't... You...

42
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,420
It's intense, making 
the decisions during the council.

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,550
I knew that by keeping her,

44
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,050
we would be back three days 
later, with regrets.

45
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,110
- Absolutely. 
- I had that feeling.

46
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,780
This advice was crazy.

47
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,370
We had a 
last minute vote change.

48
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,530
I suddenly realized 
that we guaranteed a defeat

49
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,830
if we kept J'Tia.

50
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,290
But if we took Spencer, 
he delivers.

51
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,700
And I need to win.

52
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,880
But our way of playing 
is ridiculous.

53
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,970
We are not "Intelligence",

54
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,730
one is "Imbecility".

55
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,170
We're a messy dead end 
with a handful of nerds at heart.

56
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,050
We could be the final trio. 
The only thing that separates us from it,

57
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,000
it's two whole tribes.

58
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,490
That's all?

59
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,260
- That's all. 
- No problem.

60
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,300
What's new?

61
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,010
- How much? 
- The rice is thrown.

62
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,200
How about we look at 
what the mail says?

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,990
- Yes! 
- I knew it.

64
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,800
“You dream of tasting victory.

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,730
Or so it seems.

66
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,010
Will this flavor 
be denied to you?

67
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,910
You will struggle and scream 
as you are dragged away."

68
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,880
- To eat. 
- A test with food.

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,760
The decision to keep Spencer 
will be tested today.

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,850
We keep telling ourselves that it 
's the best combination of people,

71
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,880
that it is the strongest tribe 
that we have had.

72
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,870
Today, we will be fixed.

73
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,560
- This is the opportunity to come back. 
- Yes.

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,240
The start of the return.

75
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,280
The Intelligence tribe 
really had a hard time,

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,860
and if we win, 
I think people

77
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,650
will start wondering again

78
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,150
what is the true strength 
of our tribe.

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,610
Over here, everyone!

80
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,410
Muscle and Beauty Tribes,

81
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,420
discover the new 
Intelligence tribe.

82
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,260
J'Tia was eliminated 
at the last council.

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,280
Alright, everyone.

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,610
Throw away your bandanas.

85
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,870
Intelligence, Muscle 
and Beauty no longer exist.

86
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,410
Damn it.

87
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,660
We will form 
two new tribes.

88
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,540
Oh my God.

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,110
Jeff said, "Throw away your bandanas," 
and my head went...

90
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,180
It took me six days to 
figure out who to trust.

91
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,750
And now 
I have to start all over again.

92
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,480
You're all going to take 
a wrapped bandana.

93
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,050
Don't open it yet.

94
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,870
Take whatever you want.

95
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,260
I'm nervous.

96
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,630
We are forming two new 
ones - Aparri and Solana.

97
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,220
- OK. 
- So it will be orange or purple.

98
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,640
Open all your little package

99
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,780
and see which bandana you have.

100
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,780
Intelligence stays together.

101
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,760
Many members of Muscle 
stick together.

102
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,020
- Good. 
- We all have the same.

103
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,170
Take a seat on your new mats.

104
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,900
Meet 
your new teammates.

105
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,800
Health!

106
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,200
Nice to meet you.

107
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,510
Alexis, delighted.

108
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,570
Lindsey. You must be LJ.

109
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,700
- Nice to meet you. 
- I am Jefra.

110
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,390
Well, we have 
our two new tribes.

111
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,000
The New Solana Tribe:

112
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,360
Sarah, you are the only one 
of your tribe left.

113
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,850
What do you think 
of this new tribe?

114
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,410
I feel 
like the exception.

115
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,360
My whole tribe has just left me.

116
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,060
Tasha, that's exactly 
what you called for.

117
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,970
- A new beginning. 
- In effect.

118
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,700
I'm very excited.

119
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,200
I think this tribe will be 
very strong in the trials.

120
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,110
I'm really excited, Jeff.

121
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,700
- Jefra. 
- Yes sir?

122
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,630
Almost the whole Muscle tribe 
is together, and there's LJ and you.

123
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,300
- Yes. 
- What are you doing now?

124
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,630
Our position sucks.

125
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,600
They are more numerous than us,

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,920
but I'm excited 
to be with Muscle.

127
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,120
They are supposed to be 
the best, the strongest,

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,750
and there might be 
a place for LJ and me.

129
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,440
Cliff, what's the impact on the game?

130
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,670
It changes 
people's thinking mechanisms,

131
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,980
on their position and their alliances,

132
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,410
if they will continue 
to make these alliances work

133
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,350
or create new ones.

134
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,340
Well, how about we 
go to our first

135
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,240
reward trial 
as new tribes?

136
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,440
- Yeah. 
- Yes.

137
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,190
Today a person 
will hold on to a pole.

138
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,750
On my signal, 
two members of the other tribe

139
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,640
will try to unhook 
this person from the post

140
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,880
and drag 
her to the finish line.

141
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,100
The first tribe to bring back 
the member of the other team

142
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,370
to the finish line, 
scores a point.

143
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,130
The first team to two points 
wins the reward.

144
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,870
- Want to know what's at stake? 
- Yeah!

145
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,540
It's big, it's beautiful, 
you'll love it.

146
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,520
Coffee, donuts, chocolate cookies,

147
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,510
blueberry pastries, 
cinnamon rolls, brownies.

148
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,670
A splendid way to celebrate 
the first victory of a new tribe.

149
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,610
A moment to get organized, 
and we'll get started.

150
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,790
First round, only women.

151
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,820
Morgan and Sara.

152
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,640
They gon' try to get 
Lindsey off that post

153
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,980
and get him to cross the line.

154
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,890
Trish and Jephra.

155
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,570
They will try to get Tasha.

156
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,610
We play in two points. 
Let's go.

157
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,210
Survivors, ready?

158
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,960
Tasha and Lindsey 
gather their forces.

159
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,860
You can do it, Tasha!

160
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,060
Jefra and Trish attack Tasha.

161
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,010
Sarah and Morgan 
tackle Lindsey.

162
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,440
You gotta get 'em off the post

163
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,010
and bring them back to the sand.

164
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,080
They freed 
Lindsey's arms.

165
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,870
Morgan sits on Lindsey

166
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,400
while Sarah 
takes care of the feet.

167
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,380
Come on, Tasha!

168
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,410
Tasha clings.

169
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,130
Trish and Jefra can't 
get her to move.

170
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,480
- She is well attached. 
- Hold on, Tasha!

171
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
- Fight! 
- So.

172
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,220
Sarah cleared 
Lindsey's legs.

173
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,460
Morgan and Sarah took 
Lindsey off the post.

174
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,280
Now we have to bring her back.

175
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,330
Lindsey hangs on again.

176
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,390
It gets very physical 
between Lindsey, Morgan and Sarah.

177
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,200
Trish and Jefra picked up

178
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,010
both of Tasha's arms off the pole.

179
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,300
Morgan and Sarah took 
Lindsey off the post,

180
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,640
but she clings to the sand.

181
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,010
Lindsey makes it difficult 
for Morgan and Sarah.

182
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,370
It's a great first battle.

183
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,660
Sarah and Morgan 
slowly take Lindsey away

184
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,720
towards the finish line.

185
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,750
But she makes a very big effort.

186
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,710
Lindsey is on her feet again.

187
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,440
And again on the ground. 
Tasha is locked.

188
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,640
Trish and Jefra fail 
to get her.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,950
Sarah and Morgan are 
ever closer

190
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,190
to get 
Lindsey across the line.

191
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,960
That's it, Aparri 
scores the first point!

192
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,480
Two men, one woman.

193
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,830
They will try to unhook 
Cliff from the post.

194
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,960
LJ et Trish.

195
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,860
They will try to get 
Alexis off the post.

196
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,730
Aparri leads 1-0. 
We play in 2 points.

197
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,130
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?

198
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,220
Cliff is tall.

199
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,940
It is heavy, it is high, 
it is massive.

200
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,360
Jeremiah and Spencer 
don't hesitate for a moment.

201
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,600
Alexis is no match, 
it seems unfair.

202
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,340
LJ drags her.

203
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,080
Alexis, very quickly 
unhooked from the post.

204
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,650
She struggles, 
but that won't change anything.

205
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,360
Lo and behold, Solana scores. 
Tied, 1-1.

206
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,320
Two men, one woman.

207
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,590
Each tribe fields 
its strongest players.

208
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,440
Cliff finds the post for Solana.

209
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,620
And attacking Sarah, 
Lindsey and Tony.

210
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,980
The winners of this round 
earn the reward.

211
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,070
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?

212
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,870
Come on, Spencer!

213
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,000
It's decided now, 
give it all you got,

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,170
to hold on or to drop out.

215
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,180
Depending on your role.

216
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,250
Lindsey keeps 
both of Sarah's arms unhooked.

217
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,660
Tony unhooked his legs.

218
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,730
Spencer and Jeremiah 
unhooked Cliff's arms.

219
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,820
Spencer tries 
to clinch her legs.

220
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,610
This time, Spencer and Jeremiah 
progress a bit.

221
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,060
But Cliff's feet 
are locked.

222
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,710
Sarah struggles hard 
against Tony and Lindsey.

223
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,120
They drag her, but 
she makes it difficult for them.

224
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,150
Spencer tries to clinch 
Cliff's feet.

225
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,540
Jeremiah is sitting on Cliff.

226
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,920
Tony picks up Sarah.

227
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,820
He literally lifts her up.

228
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,760
Cliff remains lying down, 
as if to say "go ahead!".

229
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,700
Try!

230
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,420
- Go on! 
- Come on, Tony!

231
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,010
Sarah fights back. 
She does not give up.

232
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,910
Sarah gives time

233
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,810
to Spencer and Jeremiah, 
and it works.

234
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,380
Spencer released 
Cliff's feet.

235
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,720
Tony shoots Sarah again.

236
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,740
She lost her two shoes.

237
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,400
The reward is near. 
Solana could win.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,570
And that's it! 
Solana wins the reward!

239
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,940
Huge physical effort 
from everyone.

240
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,260
Solana, congratulations. 
Take your reward,

241
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,780
return to camp and enjoy.

242
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,260
Apparri, I have nothing for you.

243
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,840
Grab your things 
and head back to camp.

244
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,900
It's nice to go 
from mothers to pretty daughters,

245
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,150
but it's also hard 
to lose all the time.

246
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,710
Everything related to Intelligence

247
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,160
seems 
to be going wrong somehow.

248
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,180
Nice job on that first 
reward, folks!

249
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,050
Damn, look at this shelter!

250
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,900
That's either the tarp 
or Cliff's jacket.

251
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,130
We won the race, 
good news.

252
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,360
But in reality, 
this is bad news.

253
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,370
Be careful, don't eat too fast.

254
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,510
Jefra and I are in the minority,

255
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,870
at 5-2, against the Muscle tribe.

256
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,300
I have an idol 
that I could play,

257
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,760
but it would just 
save me a few days,

258
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,210
and then I would leave.

259
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,470
My only hope 
is that they absorb me

260
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,810
as a teammate, 
rather than a threat.

261
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,880
We're trying to guess 
what you're doing.

262
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,930
In your opinion?

263
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,860
- Are you a hairdresser? 
- Yeah.

264
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,650
The scissors.

265
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,630
You 
must be a professional surfer.

266
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,320
I am a surf 
and martial arts coach.

267
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,000
- You are a horse trainer. 
- Yeah.

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,050
Where do you come from?

269
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,800
I'd never thought...

270
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,420
I thought you were 
from Montana or Colorado.

271
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,520
I found out that LJ 
is from Massachusetts,

272
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,300
which I would not have guessed. 
I'm coming too.

273
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,390
It creates a bond between us.

274
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,300
You were in Saugus High School?

275
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,570
- When did you graduate? 
- 97.

276
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,040
I thought those in Beauty were 
spending time on their looks.

277
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,420
But LJ is pretty laid back 
and easy going.

278
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,050
And you can tell he's a gentleman. 
He's from Boston,

279
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,720
that must be why 
I immediately found him cute.

280
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,170
I found myself single, 
and I said to myself "I want a horse".

281
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,750
- And when I got him... 
- Are you single?

282
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,950
- Yes, single. 
- Oh, oh, Trish!

283
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,310
- Oh, shut up! 
- Single!

284
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,980
I find LJ very handsome,

285
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,270
but I could be his mother.

286
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,550
I am not Mrs. Robinson.

287
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,730
It's perfect. 
We have a small island.

288
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,330
When Trish said 
she was from Boston,

289
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,190
it was a ray 
of sunshine for me.

290
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,870
There is already a bond between us,

291
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,760
and if i were to be attracted 
to someone a little older,

292
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,260
a bachelor who should have lived,

293
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,340
Whether she's attracted to 
my sex appeal or something,

294
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,890
I will use it to save myself.

295
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,120
I should go out more. 
I didn't know about twerking.

296
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,700
I would like to hear Trish roar.

297
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,670
No, nobody wants to 
hear me roar, believe me!

298
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,370
Trish exaggerates her laugh

299
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,580
when she's with guys, 
and that disgusts me.

300
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,730
You're 50, stop trying

301
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,470
to attract the attention 
of 20-year-old men.

302
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,420
Seriously.

303
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
Things couldn't 
have turned out better today.

304
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,020
"come on!".

305
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,180
Amazing, all those purples.

306
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,130
I'm happy 
with this mix of tribes.

307
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,050
I was able to keep five 
of my original team-mates.

308
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,980
If we can keep 
moving forward with these people,

309
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,730
we are in an excellent position.

310
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,100
The only thing I hated 
was when Trish got purple.

311
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,140
Right now, 
my concern is Trish.

312
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,060
I don't know what 
's going on between her and LJ.

313
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,100
I have to keep an eye on them.

314
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,640
It's imperative.

315
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,440
- High five! 
- Here, my friend!

316
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,230
What a beautiful shelter!

317
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,620
If I had known 
that we would have visitors,

318
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,990
I would have cleaned up. 
Our laundry is hanging everywhere.

319
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,560
You are at home, 
you are not guests.

320
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,110
Get comfortable.

321
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,740
I am the only 
original Aparri in the tribe,

322
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,470
with three members of Intelligence 
and three of Beauty.

323
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,350
This is clearly 
a worrying situation.

324
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,270
Because we don't know 
who we can trust.

325
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,050
That's why I wanted to 
know who, on the first day,

326
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,430
had the clue for the idol, 
or chose the food.

327
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,500
We have two bags of rice here.

328
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,860
Thanks to Trish.

329
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,880
Trish didn't choose the clue, 
but the rice.

330
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,190
- She chose a second bag? 
- So Garret chose the clue?

331
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,190
He didn't tell us anything.

332
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,370
He told us 
there was a decision.

333
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,530
- We were going to ask. 
- Yeah.

334
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,720
What was the decision?

335
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,110
Rice or the idol?

336
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,630
- You're kidding? 
- No, that was it.

337
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,680
I did not find it.

338
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,420
- Oh, you looked for the idol? 
- Yes.

339
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,080
Sarah revealed to me,

340
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,020
when she said Trish 
preferred rice to idol.

341
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,480
I had chosen the clue 
and kept it a secret ever since.

342
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,620
I hope I can make 
a new start with this tribe

343
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,520
and let no 
one hold it against me.

344
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,760
It was a clue for the idol 
or a bag of rice.

345
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,040
I looked for the idol. 
But obviously I don't.

346
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,760
My God!

347
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,960
Morgan lied 
from day one.

348
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,590
It made her even 
more suspicious than before.

349
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,150
Like she was carrying 
a hundred red flags.

350
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,450
They told me exactly 
what I needed to know:

351
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,540
that you should neither 
trust her nor ally herself with her.

352
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,220
So I will protect myself

353
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,060
and switch sides immediately.

354
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,260
I would like to consider 
a few scenarios with you.

355
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,980
My closest friend 
in my tribe was Jefra.

356
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,680
And she's not here.

357
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,750
So I think 
the only safe scenario

358
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,940
would be that we allied, 
all four.

359
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,030
I don't know 
if you're in,

360
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,200
and it's hard to 
immediately trust.

361
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,590
But I give you my word, 
I'm serious.

362
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,980
That Alexis came to see us

363
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,910
so fast, almost desperate, 
is telling.

364
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,510
Now that we see a little 
of the divisions of Beauty,

365
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,710
it greatly improves 
the position of Intelligence.

366
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,610
The fact that they're so divided

367
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,450
shows that they can be played 
against each other.

368
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,290
Initially, 
Jeremiah was with us,

369
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,310
but he changed sides, 
then changed sides again.

370
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,820
And Morgan lies all the time.

371
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,590
In the whole game, she 
never went to fetch water.

372
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,180
She had to pick up 
two pieces of wood.

373
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,260
The Beauty tribe 
loves gossip.

374
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,990
It feels like high school.

375
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,420
They gossip about each other, 
spread rumours.

376
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,430
Sometimes in front of each other.

377
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,390
She and LJ cuddle 
every night.

378
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,020
He always asks her 
to move her buttocks.

379
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,450
Butt wiggling, yeah!

380
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,950
She is proud to know how to 
move her ass like that.

381
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,780
They seem singularly lacking 
in social skills

382
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,090
for a tribe of 
supposedly beautiful and sociable people.

383
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,220
My instinct tells me

384
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,410
that Morgan wouldn't hesitate 
to betray me.

385
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,260
Really?

386
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,860
Are you and Alexis friends?

387
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,340
We were at the start.

388
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,260
LJ, her and I, we were like that.

389
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,620
So I'm away.

390
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,890
Do you see 
what I mean?

391
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,180
I will follow you.

392
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,060
On bolts to ground four.

393
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,060
For now, Intelligence is 
in the best possible position.

394
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,300
At first, I thought 
we should face Beauty,

395
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,420
but there are 
dissensions between them.

396
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,430
So we went from tragedy

397
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,230
to what appears to be a triumph.

398
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,900
Just when you think you're lost, 
things change.

399
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,400
And you're back on top.

400
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,480
The night of this big storm, 
were you cold?

401
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,390
- That was crazy, right? 
- I no longer felt my extremities.

402
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,240
Me too, I didn't feel 
my toes for 3 hours.

403
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,750
I felt so good,

404
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,410
before the change, 
my position was solid.

405
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,320
But with just LJ and me, 
and the whole Muscle tribe,

406
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,470
the feeling 
is totally different.

407
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,060
- I'll give you a quick rundown. 
- Yes, what's going on?

408
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,500
Lindsey and I are not...

409
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,860
We are not in...

410
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,370
- You're not on the same side? 
- No no no.

411
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,100
You understood that quickly, huh?

412
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,450
She will make you feel like 
you are working hard.

413
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,830
- OK. 
- But this is not the case.

414
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,370
She is allied with Cliff.

415
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,050
- Lindsey and Cliff? 
- Yes.

416
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,300
When Trish 
summed up alliances for me

417
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,850
and explained his position to me,

418
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,440
it was a bit surprising, 
because it happened rather quickly.

419
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,570
I won't sell 
the bear skin until I kill it,

420
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,410
but there may be a space

421
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,260
where LJ and I could sneak.

422
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,660
There's something 
fishy about Cliff.

423
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,430
We wanted to get rid of it, 
but we couldn't lose the race.

424
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,110
LJ is clearly with me, 
we are very close.

425
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,760
I was very naive at the start of the game.

426
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,590
But I'm starting to realize

427
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,710
that I have to do what it takes 
to get to the top.

428
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,620
OK, we agree.

429
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,420
From the start, I thought I 
was the most misplaced.

430
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,850
But everything was turned upside down.

431
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,150
Hi big guy!

432
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,570
Over here, everyone!

433
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,150
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

434
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,270
First of all, 
I take back the idols.

435
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,760
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

436
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,920
As of now, we only play 
for an immunity idol.

437
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,850
We're going to get rid 
of the little brother.

438
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,120
And we keep Mom.

439
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,420
Your Dad.

440
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,080
I'm not really sure.

441
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,390
Today each tribe 
will use a large trunk

442
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,460
to knock down two walls.

443
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,250
Then you will maneuver the trunk

444
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,340
through a maze.

445
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,750
The first tribe 
to cross the labyrinth

446
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,340
and ring the gong

447
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,780
wins immunity 
and is shielded from the vote.

448
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,780
The losers will go to the council, 
where someone will be

449
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,830
the fifth person eliminated 
from Survivor Cagayan.

450
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,970
This event is played 
six against six.

451
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,280
In each tribe, 
someone will not participate.

452
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,180
- It will be me. 
- Trish is not participating for Solana.

453
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,880
What about you, Apparri?

454
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,080
Are you good 
at puzzles and mazes?

455
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,420
- I want to participate. 
- Me too.

456
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,280
Do we do paper, rock, scissors?

457
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,000
I really want to participate.

458
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,870
Who will it be?

459
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,460
Do paper, stone, scissors.

460
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,140
- Go for it. 
- OK.

461
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,180
Paper, stone, scissors.

462
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,890
The pebble breaks the scissors.

463
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,010
Morgan, take a seat on the bench.

464
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,780
Alexis will participate.

465
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,630
One minute to get organized, 
and we'll get started.

466
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,670
Well, on and go.

467
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,890
For immunity. 
Survivors, ready?

468
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,840
The six must hold 
the trunk permanently.

469
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,650
From the outset, it's neck and neck.

470
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,500
Use the trunk 
to break down this wall.

471
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,710
It's not conclusive for Solana.

472
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,550
Apparri, it's harder 
than it looks, isn't it?

473
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,930
It's harder 
than you thought.

474
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,120
You have to lift the trunk 
more to hit higher.

475
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,750
Solana does some damage, 
here we go.

476
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,220
Apari insists.

477
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,860
But they have trouble 
lifting the trunk.

478
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,100
You can cross, 
as long as you don't let go of the trunk.

479
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,400
Solana makes the crossing easier.

480
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,400
- Can we switch places? 
- Yes.

481
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,260
Yes, you can switch places.

482
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,710
Aparri will change strategy

483
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,820
and put the tough ones in the front.

484
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,080
Solana has crossed the first wall.

485
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,360
Aparri is still 
on the first wall.

486
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,810
There are two to cross.

487
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,440
Solana attacked her second wall.

488
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,320
It takes a lot of strength. 
The trunks are heavy.

489
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,710
The walls are very strong.

490
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,890
Sarah crosses. 
Aparri passes to the second wall.

491
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,360
Aparri is in on it again.

492
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,370
Solana lost momentum.

493
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,520
Aparri changed strategy,

494
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,670
with Jeremiah and Spencer, 
and it works.

495
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,430
Aparri begins to cross.

496
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,060
Solana now crosses.

497
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,870
It's neck and neck, 
it's going to be played out in the maze.

498
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,550
- Go! Go! Go! 
- Let's go!

499
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,600
- Gently. 
- This way.

500
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,540
Once the trunk is in place, 
remove the handles

501
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,540
and start the maze.

502
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,990
Solana attacks the maze.

503
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,080
Aparri attacks 
the maze now.

504
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,550
PUSH!

505
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:45,880
PUSH!

506
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,210
Left! Right! Left!

507
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,420
Solana has a slight lead.

508
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,750
But Aparri is right behind.

509
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,890
PUSH! PUSH!

510
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,360
Back up, back up, back up!

511
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,800
Solana makes a big mistake, 
they have to back off.

512
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,920
No no no! 
Step back, step back!

513
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,440
Aparri makes the same mistake. 
They must back down.

514
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,950
Lots of teamwork. 
Communication is crucial.

515
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,100
Solana brought out the front. 
Also appeared.

516
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,140
Is it correct?

517
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,940
This is where the Intelligence tribe,

518
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,020
which is entirely 
at Aparri, should shine.

519
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,570
don't want to go back 
to tribal council.

520
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,830
No one from the Muscle Tribe 
has gone to the council yet.

521
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,500
- PUSH! 
- Aparri is very close.

522
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,910
Solana is now very close.

523
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,580
It's neck and neck again.

524
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,620
- PUSH! 
- Go on!

525
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,370
- PUSH! 
- Yes.

526
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,590
Apparri crossed!

527
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,970
Huge victory for the underdogs!

528
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,830
Aparri wins immunity!

529
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,130
My God!

530
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,670
It was awesome!

531
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,570
We communicated and we did it!

532
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,180
My God!

533
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,260
How it happened?

534
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,490
Apparri, who wants her?

535
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,520
Give it to Tash.

536
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,660
Immunity for Aparri, 
no tribal council,

537
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,960
which is a big change 
for Tash, Kass and Spencer.

538
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,450
Take your things, 
return to camp.

539
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,800
Enjoy your free evening.

540
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,860
Well, Solana, see 
you tonight at the council,

541
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,660
where someone will be the fifth 
person eliminated from Survivor Cagayan.

542
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,290
Take your things, 
return to camp.

543
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,190
How did we 
lose this race?

544
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,100
She was made for Muscle.

545
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,810
Fortunately, we have the majority, 
things are clear.

546
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,620
LJ is dangerous, 
so he leaves first.

547
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,570
It sucks.

548
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,800
What was the thing?

549
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,310
I thought we were in the lead.

550
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,380
I don't know 
what happened.

551
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,470
All I know 
is that in the end, I was dead.

552
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,930
In the end, 
we have to leave it to them,

553
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,070
they beat us.

554
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,470
- I hate losing so much. 
- Yeah.

555
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,820
Upon arriving at the test,

556
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,070
"no problem, 
it's brute force".

557
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,800
There is no doubt, 
we should have won.

558
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,300
Alas, we lost.

559
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,730
And that met Jephra and me 
in a difficult position.

560
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,750
They will probably 
try to eliminate me.

561
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,220
Unless something 
happens, I'm screwed.

562
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,450
I understand it's a game

563
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,580
and that you have 
a strong alliance.

564
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,480
But I hope 
you will consider

565
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,740
that I can help you.

566
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,060
You know, in trials.

567
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,960
At this point, we can keep LJ 
for the trials.

568
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,580
But he's from Massachusetts. 
Trish is from Massachusetts.

569
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,490
They have this bond in common.

570
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,020
And they went for walks alone 
and had discussions.

571
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,910
She is already playing with her emotions.

572
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,300
And if we get carried away 
by our emotions in this game,

573
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,880
that's when we make 
silly mistakes.

574
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,240
The four of us will vote for LJ.

575
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,960
- First? 
- Light!

576
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,020
I am as good, if not better, 
on earth than him,

577
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,470
and ten times better 
than him in the water.

578
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,480
So, let's turn the "fort".

579
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,960
Yes, it's over for LJ.

580
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,820
Muscle elders, 
we're in a good position.

581
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,200
On our old camp,

582
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,860
there were some tensions, 
some problems.

583
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,400
But now 
it's a whole new game.

584
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,940
And we have to have 
an overview.

585
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,780
And the best for us 
is to get rid of LJ.

586
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,170
Alas, paranoia is mounting 
at the moment.

587
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,100
Trish does what he wants.

588
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,750
Don't worry about Trish.

589
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,850
He's the kind of person 
who likes to be complimented.

590
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,880
Do not worry about that. 
Everything is fine for us.

591
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,000
What is their plan?

592
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,400
They want to fire me.

593
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,780
We shouldn't 
be seen discussing too much.

594
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,740
But you're in on it.

595
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,980
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

596
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,370
Completely.

597
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,530
We want Cliff gone. 
He is really shady.

598
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,750
We have already tried to eliminate it.

599
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,940
- Who exactly? 
- Tony and me.

600
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,520
It would be you, 
Jefra, me and Tony.

601
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,870
You are in?

602
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,230
Of course, if it's not 
my name that comes out.

603
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,420
Exactly.

604
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,140
Well, that's all 
we need to know.

605
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,790
Trish told me she wanted 
to get rid of Cliff.

606
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,040
I was shocked.

607
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,050
Apparently 
Trish and Tony don't like Cliff.

608
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,080
And that makes no sense to me.

609
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,730
You are five against two. 
There is nothing to discuss.

610
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,130
But if she is telling the truth?

611
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,340
I may not have 
to play my idol.

612
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,710
- That's the plan. 
- I hope so, Trish.

613
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,110
You trust me?

614
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,560
Yes. I do not have a choice.

615
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,880
We're from Boston, damn it, okay?

616
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,220
I play with my heart, 
and I really like LJ.

617
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,260
He's a gentleman, he gets along 
with everyone, he never gives up.

618
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,250
He has it all. 
But Cliff, he's not doing anything.

619
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,700
And 14 days of his sufficiency,

620
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,930
it's the most my 
nervous system can take.

621
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,690
So we'll write Cliff's name.

622
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,790
And the best part is that 
Cliff doesn't suspect a thing.

623
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,570
And that really makes me laugh.

624
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,930
- She's going to betray us. 
- But no.

625
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,300
Of course it is, Woo.

626
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,590
I swear on everything I love,

627
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,160
she will fuck us, 
I guarantee it.

628
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,540
So what do you think?

629
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,990
And you?

630
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,160
Cliff does nothing.

631
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,660
- I understand. 
- He never picked up a piece of wood.

632
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,260
So for me, he goes first.

633
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,760
Do you know that in thirteen days,

634
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,480
he didn't say a word to me?

635
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,720
- I know, but... 
- Let's see it this way.

636
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,670
When we merge, we'll have 
to fire him anyway.

637
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,880
Because he is strong.

638
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,470
He will kill everyone 
in the immunity trials.

639
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,920
By her sheer strength.

640
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,190
He must go.

641
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,360
He leaves first, 
and then it will be crazy.

642
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,790
Trish took me aside

643
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,340
and told me he wanted 
to get rid of Cliff.

644
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,360
You have to cut off the snake's head.

645
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,860
Which is crazy.

646
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,770
I don't know if she 
's bipolar, schizo or what.

647
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,730
But there's no reason 
to do that now.

648
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,170
What needs to be done 
is get rid of LJ.

649
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,320
He has the heart, 
the energy, the ambition,

650
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,960
he has a strategic mind, 
so he is dangerous.

651
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,400
Do you trust me 
on this one?

652
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,880
I trust you, 
but here's what I think.

653
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,230
- Jefra and LJ are isolated. 
- Yes.

654
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,550
We are five solids, five solids.

655
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,080
That does not make any sense.

656
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,280
They could get us 
one by one if we open that door.

657
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,840
You think Jefra 
and LJ are stupid?

658
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,160
- Nope. 
- Exactly.

659
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,820
But we could be 
the turkeys of the farce.

660
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,450
- We won't. 
- OK.

661
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,930
That's the thing. I don't like Cliff.

662
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,530
I never trusted him.

663
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,970
Because Cliff 
has a lot of influence.

664
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,000
And he puts people 
in his pocket.

665
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,530
Which makes it very dangerous.

666
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,910
More Virer Cliff,

667
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,520
it's all about LJ.

668
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,530
Do I trust him? 
Surely not!

669
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,900
So I don't know 
what I'm going to do.

670
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,530
What were you discussing?

671
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,710
To stay strong, this and that.

672
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,860
She said she hopes 
we stay strong.

673
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,810
So...

674
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,160
You are not trying to...

675
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,250
She said 
the dynamic had changed

676
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,200
"I know she has changed."

677
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
But if we do something crazy...

678
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,210
Listen. Trish can act 
if she wants.

679
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,630
- Not alone. 
- Exactly.

680
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,940
If Trish wants to make a hit, 
she'll be eliminated.

681
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,200
We need stability.

682
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,400
She can do whatever she wants.

683
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,550
In the end, it's always 
four against three.

684
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,420
I know I know. 
It's only speculation.

685
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,930
- But who's leaving? 
- LJ is leaving.

686
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,750
- LJ. 
- OK.

687
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,950
In fact, I'm looking forward 
to going to the council.

688
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,100
Trish lets 
her emotions rule her.

689
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,340
So we'll cut her off 
from her new support,

690
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,060
and bring her back to 
her old comrades.

691
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,860
I talked about Cliff with her.

692
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,740
I do not know if that's true. 
But we have no way out.

693
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,520
- It's you and me. 
- Tony makes me nervous.

694
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,070
Do you think Tony will vote Cliff?

695
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,130
I do not know.

696
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,620
How do you know what's on his mind?

697
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,270
Trish is ready to betray.

698
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,390
The problem is that 
I have my doubts about Tony.

699
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,970
But in reality, 
I have no choice.

700
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:38,420
So I fully 
trust Trish and Tony

701
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,040
to do 
what they said tonight.

702
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,100
And if they start 
being too talkative,

703
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,010
I will know if they play 
to eliminate me,

704
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,700
and I will play 
my idol if necessary.

705
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,860
Those of you who do 
n't have a torch, light one.

706
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,950
It is part 
of the council ritual,

707
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,720
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

708
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,170
When your fire goes out, 
it's the end for you.

709
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,290
LJ, after changing tribes, 
you return to your camp,

710
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,200
but with only two members, 
and five from another tribe.

711
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,800
Who really controls 
this camp now?

712
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,390
It was as if Jefra and I 
were a couple

713
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,170
who sold his house

714
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,450
and that there was a group 
about to buy it.

715
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,490
"When you want us 
to leave, let us know."

716
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,460
It was very intimidating 
and unpleasant.

717
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,160
But in the end, 
it's Jef and me,

718
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,310
and we try to enjoy 
it as much as we can.

719
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:00,560
Cliff, you are coming to 
a new camp, but in the majority.

720
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,410
Has life really changed?

721
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:07,750
It may seem simple, keep 
progressing with the majority,

722
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,210
but there will always be someone

723
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,730
who is not comfortable 
in his situation,

724
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,380
who can't put 
his emotions aside.

725
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,820
And people have to understand

726
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,070
that in this game 
majorities are essential.

727
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,550
Ultimately, 
that's all that matters.

728
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,860
So, Woo, looks 
like Cliff is dreading

729
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,800
that someone in this group 
of five does something stupid

730
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,470
and plays with his emotions.

731
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,840
Is this your interpretation?

732
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,030
Yes, I am on this ground.

733
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,880
You can't get carried 
away by your emotions.

734
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,200
You have to trust 
the group to which you belong.

735
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,270
You have to stay with. 
And go against it

736
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,540
will only put you 
in a bad situation.

737
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,330
Trish, does this advice

738
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,970
will test the loyalty of the five 
former members of Muscle?

739
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,490
I would say yes, absolutely.

740
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,880
Having the majority is important,

741
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,930
but only if it is 
of interest to you.

742
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,780
If not, other arrangements may have to be found.

743
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,640
Jefra, it's the only thing 
we can want to hear

744
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,750
if we are you or LJ.

745
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,370
That there is a chance.

746
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,590
Maybe a little,

747
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,580
but maybe 
there is an opening.

748
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,960
Yes, and I understand 
the importance of having the majority,

749
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,720
but at 
the same time, risk is central in this game.

750
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,950
And someone will be fifth 
in this alliance.

751
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,860
And this person 
will not reach the top alone.

752
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,260
Lindsey, the danger for you 
is that LJ and Jefra

753
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,290
have nothing to lose.

754
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,540
It's true. I mean... 
I hate to say that,

755
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,880
but I think 
we should stick together.

756
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,020
I think we have a better 
chance, because it's not 5-2,

757
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,440
it will be us five,

758
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,340
and then the other tribe, 
ultimately together.

759
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,710
Without Jefra and LJ.

760
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,910
Cliff, is there anything 
cathartic about finally coming here?

761
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,510
I see it as 
the NBA playoffs.

762
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,750
The season only really starts 
when you lose a game.

763
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,340
The old Aparri, 
we hadn't been here yet.

764
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,210
We really do not know

765
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,050
what goes on in 
one or the other's head.

766
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,660
Once we see it, 
we can make adjustments

767
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,090
and go ahead.

768
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,640
Do you dread, Tony, 
that tonight's advice

769
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,090
could tilt the game 
one way or the other?

770
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,420
This advice will definitely swing 
the game one way or the other.

771
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,880
After tonight's vote, 
we will see

772
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,820
if we can move 
forward as a team,

773
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,130
or if we're going 
to take a step back

774
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,890
and move forward 
with a different team.

775
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,820
It all depends on the outcome of the vote.

776
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,010
Well, it's time to vote.

777
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,570
Woo, it's up to you.

778
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,360
Sorry, buddy.

779
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,960
The last thing we need 
is for you to reach fusion

780
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,950
and reform 
the Beauty Tribe.

781
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,370
Cliff, you can't 
decide everything forever.

782
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,980
I hope the others 
will follow the plan.

783
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,920
Nothing personal, 
it's purely strategic.

784
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,110
I will count the votes.

785
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,660
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

786
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,430
now is the time to do it.

787
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,680
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

788
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,710
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

789
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,870
I will read the votes.

790
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,780
First vote.

791
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,100
LJ.

792
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,620
Cliff. Equality. 
Two Cliff votes, two LJ votes.

793
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,890
That's three LJ votes, 
two Cliff votes.

794
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,200
Cliff. Equality. 
Three Cliff votes, three LJ votes.

795
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,550
One vote remains.

796
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,120
Fifth person eliminated 
from Survivor Cagayan:

797
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,300
Cliff. You must 
bring me your torch.

798
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,620
Cliff, the tribe has spoken.

799
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,720
Good luck to you.

800
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,380
It's time to go.

801
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,720
It worked.

802
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,830
Oh my God.

803
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:15,510
You came to the board 
with a big question.

804
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,350
Where does the loyalty lie 
in this group?

805
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,250
I believe you have the answer.

806
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,570
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

807
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,640
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

808
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,660
In the next episode of Survivor...

809
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,070
Trish makes me sick.

810
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,430
- A bitter quarrel... 
- Lindsey isn't helping.

811
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,860
- ...has been growing for days. 
- I can not stand her.

812
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,830
And can no longer be contained.

813
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,460
Everything you are, 
I can't stand it.

814
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,580
I don't love you.

815
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,440
She is tyrannical, 
I can't stand her presence.

816
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,320
What's going on?

817
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,930
I had too much faith 
in my alliance.

818
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,540
I thought I was...

819
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,190
aware of 
what was happening in the camp.

820
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,010
But it's hard, it's hard.

821
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,160
And that's what happens in this game.

822
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,100
When you think 
things are going your way

823
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,130
boom, you're being betrayed.
