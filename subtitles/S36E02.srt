1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,730
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT GHOST ISLAND,

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,070
JACOB WAS FIRST VISITOR TO
ENCOUNTER THE GRAVEYARD FOR BAD

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,330
"SURVIVOR" DECISIONS.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,000
AND HE WILLED A CURSED LEGACY
ADVANTAGE TO MORGAN.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,070
IT'S THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,800
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,130
I'M TOUCHING IT.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,770
Jeff: AT THE NAVITI TRIBE,
DOMENICK USED HIS FAKE IDOL IN

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,370
AN ATTEMPT TO GARNER TRUST.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,600
READ IT.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,430
IT'S SICK.

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,800
Jeff: BUT IT BECOME FIRED.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,600
LOOK, I DON'T TRUST HIM.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,100
SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS JUST OFF.

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,670
Jeff: THE MALL OF AMERICA
TRIBE WAS FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL,

16
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,830
AND JAMES WAS ON THE HOT SEAT.

17
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,000
I COST US THAT CHALLENGE.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I CHOKED.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,830
Jeff: BUT A BLIND SIDE WAS
BREWING.

20
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,230
WE GOT TO GET JACOB.

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,270
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
JAMES RECEIVED VOTES, BUT JACOB

22
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,130
WAS SENT HOME.

23
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,970
JACOB, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

24
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,070
Jeff: 18 ARE LEFT.

25
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:05,170
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:12,200
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,000
AFTER THAT TRIBAL I'M FEELING
A LITTLE BIT DRAINED OBVIOUSLY.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,570
IT WAS PRETTY MUCH A ROLLER
COASTER RIDE FOR ME AND MY

29
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,100
HEARTBEAT.

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,170
THAT WAS A GOOD PLAN.

31
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,930
I'M GLAD IT WORKED.

32
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,870
JAMES, FOR THE RECORD, PLEASE
DON'T HATE YOURSELF.

33
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,770
I'LL TRY.

34
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,400
TONIGHT I ENDED UP GETTING TWO
VOTES.

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,530
I DID DESERVE TO BE THE SECOND
TARGET.

36
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,770
BEING RAISED IN A
KOREAN-AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD HAS

37
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,300
TAUGHT ME TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF
MY FAILURE, BUT I'M GLAD I'M

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,100
STILL HERE.

39
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,370
I'M READY THE FIGHT FOR ANOTHER
DAY.

40
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,900
IT'S TIME TO WIN.

41
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,470
I'M DONE LOSING.

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:04,370
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

43
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,370
NAVITI GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW MALOLO TRIBE.

44
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,370
JACOB VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

45
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,900
WE'LL BRING DONATHAN IN
RETURNING FROM GHOST ISLAND.

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,300
COME ON IN, DONATHAN.

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,370
WELCOME BACK.

48
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,400
DONATHAN ALSO GETTING HIS FIRST
LOOK AT THE NEW MALOLO TRIBE.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,200
LIB AGREE, TWO CHALLENGES IN,
YOU'VE LOST TWO TRIBE MEMBERS.

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,000
WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW IN THE
GAME WITH THIS TRIBE?

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,130
I STILL FEEL WE'RE UNITED.

52
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,230
WE'RE POSITIVE.

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,100
I CAN SAY WE'RE TILL GROWING
INTO THAT BEST TRIBE EVER.

54
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,900
Jeff: BRADLEY, WHERE'S
NAVITI RIGHT NOW?

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,000
I THINK WE'RE STRONG.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
WE'RE GETTING ALONG REALLY WELL.

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,030
IT'S REALLY A COHESIVE BUNCH.

58
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,470
Jeff: SO IT SOUNDS LIKE
BOTH TRIBES ARE FEELING REALLY

59
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,400
GOOD.

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,170
WHICH MAKES IT A PERFECT TIME
FOR A SWITCH.

61
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,230
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR BUFFS.

62
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,770
WE ARE SWITCHING TRIBES.

63
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,500
DANG IT.

64
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,230
DAMN.

65
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,970
IT'S BEEN REAL, GUYS.

66
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,630
DAMN.

67
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,870
OH.

68
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,430
Jeff: ANGELA, WHAT ARE YOU
FEELING RIGHT NOW BEFORE WE DRAW

69
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,600
BUFFS?

70
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,130
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF
ANXIETY, LIKE A BRECKEN FAMILY.

71
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,030
SO IT'S BAD.

72
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,670
Jeff: IS THAT A LITTLE BIT
OF EMOTION?

73
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,830
I DON'T KNOW.

74
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,100
I LOVE THESE GUYS.

75
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,370
I DID TWO DEPLOYMENTS IN THE
MILITARY WHERE YOU BUILD STRONG,

76
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,430
LASTING RELATIONSHIPS IN A VERY
SHORT TIME.

77
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,070
TO ME THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME,
SO I'M ABSOLUTELY NERVOUS ABOUT

78
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,300
THIS SWITCH.

79
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,070
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

80
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,570
LET'S GET TO IT.

81
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,300
DON'T OPEN THEM.

82
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,530
WAIT FOR ME.

83
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,030
I'M IN A BIT OF A POWER
POSITION RIGHT NOW, SO I'M KIND

84
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,170
OF FREAKING OUT.

85
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,830
BUT I KNEW I WASN'T GOING TO BE
IN POWER THE WHOLE GAME.

86
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,430
YOU GOT TO RIDE THE WAVE.

87
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,030
THERE'S WAVE THERE, YOU GOT SURF
IT.

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,870
Jeff: TWO BUFFS LEFT.

89
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,200
MICHAEL WILL GET TRULY THE LAST
SHOT.

90
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,830
ALL RIGHT.

91
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:14,630
EVERYBODY REVEAL YOUR NEW BUFFS.

92
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,330
SAY HELLO TO YOUR NEW TRIBE.

93
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,030
PURPLE.

94
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,030
WHAT ARE YOU, DOM?

95
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,300
PURPLE.

96
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,070
I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE I STILL
HAVE TO DEAL WITH CHRIS ON THIS

97
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,570
TRIBE, SO IT IS CRITICAL TO ME
THAT I BUILD WITH RELATIONSHIPS

98
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,930
WITH EVERYONE OUT HERE IN ORDER
TO TAKE HIM OUT.

99
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,600
Jeff: IF YOU'RE PURPLE,
YOU'RE NAVITI.

100
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,900
HEAD OVER TO THE PURPLE MAT.

101
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,270
IF YOU'RE ORANGE, YOU ARE
MALOLO.

102
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,170
HEAD OVER TO THE ORANGE MAT.

103
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,170
I'M MALOLO.

104
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,700
Jeff: MAKE YOUR MOVE.

105
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,030
HEY, GUYS.

106
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,300
MICE TO FINALLY TALK TO YOU.

107
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,070
I KNOW.

108
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,570
HI.

109
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,800
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

110
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,900
ON THE NEW NAVITI TRIBE, THERE
ARE FOUR OLD MALOLO, DONATHAN,

111
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,100
LIBBY, LAUREL, AND JAMES.

112
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,900
AN WE HAVE FIVE OLD NAVITI,
DOMENICK, CHRIS, ANGELA,

113
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,170
WENDELL, AND MORGAN.

114
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,070
HOW YOU FEELING, MORGAN?

115
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,670
I'M FEELING GOOD.

116
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,370
PURPLE IS MY FAVORITE COLOR.

117
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,470
WE HAVE A LIVING ROOM.

118
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,570
WE HAVE THE COMFORT.

119
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,370
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD.

120
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,430
Jeff: AND YOU STILL HAVE
THE NUMBERS.

121
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,170
AND WE STILL HAVE THE
NUMBERS, THAT'S FOR SURE.

122
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,370
Jeff: OKAY.

123
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,000
ON THE NEW MALOLO TRIBE, THERE
ARE ALSO FOUR OLD MALOLO WITH

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,630
JENNA, STEPHANIE, BRENDAN AND
MICHAEL AND FIVE NAVITI WITH

125
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,430
DESIREE, SEBASTIAN, KELLYN,
BRADLEY, AND CHELSEA.

126
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,000
KELLYN, IS THERE ANY PART OF YOU
THAT'S NOW WONDERING WHAT'S

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,530
GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS NAVITI
FIVE?

128
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,730
CAN WE ACTUALLY STAY TOGETHER?

129
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,070
I MEAN, JEFF, I FEEL REALLY
GOOD ABOUT PURPLE, BUT AT THE

130
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,000
SAME TIME, THINGS CHANGE.

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,270
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN, AN I'M EXCITED TO MEET

132
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,500
MORE PEOPLE AND OPEN UP NEW
TREASURE BOXES OF LOVE.

133
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,770
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

134
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,070
MALOLO, NAVITI, GRAB YOUR STUFF.

135
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,900
HEAD OUT.

136
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,270
THE GAME HAS CHANGED ONCE AGAIN.

137
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,000
FROM THE OUTSIDE IT LOOK LIKE
I WANT TO WORK WITH MALOLO, BUT

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,970
MY GAME PLAN IS TO KEEP US
TOGETHER BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SO

139
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,070
EPIC TOO JUST LIKE GO AND KNOCK
OUT THOSE MALOLO TRIBE MEMBERS

140
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:25,100
ONE BY ONE.

141
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,670
ONE BY ONE.

142
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,800
WELCOME.

143
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,000
DOES THIS WILL BE A LOT
DIFFERENT FROM YOUR CAMP?

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,070
YEAH.

145
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,600
WELL, MINUS THE PILLOWS AND
THE HAMMOCK AND STUFF.

146
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,670
MAJORITY IS KEY AN CRUCIAL IN
THIS GAME, SO WHEN I LOOKED

147
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,370
AROUND AND I SAW MY FOUR HOMIES
FROM THE OLD NAVITI TRIBE, I WAS

148
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,570
STOKED.

149
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,500
IT'S THE PERFECT SITUATION FOR
ME, SO RIGHT NOW I'M A HAPPY,

150
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,800
SMILEY, GIG LIE PIECE OF LAFFEY
TAFFY.

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,670
BANANA FLAVORED.

152
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,770
YOU KNOW HOW YOU JUST THROW
STUFF UP.

153
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,830
SO PROBABLY HALF OF WHAT WE'VE
DONE ISN'T RIGHT OR ISN'T GOOD.

154
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,430
IT'S A NICE BIG SHELTER.

155
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,700
IT'S JUST REAL BUMPY.

156
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,000
TO GO FROM NAVITI TO MALOLO,
I THINK IT WAS A BIT OF A SHOCK

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,230
FOR US BECAUSE THE SHELTER IS
JUST ALL TANGLED UP AND ONE BIG

158
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,700
HOT MESS OVER HERE.

159
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,500
THIS IS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE MEETING
A FRIEND'S NEW BABY WHO THEY

160
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,400
THINK IS SO CUTE AND IT'S THE
LOVE OF THEIR LIFE, BUT YOU'RE

161
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,900
LIKE, THAT BABY IS UGLY.

162
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,400
LIKE WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER
HERE?

163
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,330
IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT TO
TAKE IN HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS IS,

164
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,330
MAN.

165
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,900
YOU GET LOST IN WHAT WE'RE
DOING.

166
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,170
IT'S EASIER THAN "TWO AND A
HALF MEN'S" CAMP.

167
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,370
I BET.

168
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,900
COMPARED TO THEIR BEACH.

169
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,770
THIS IS LIKE A GRASSLAND.

170
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,000
ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME
ABOUT NAVITI IS THEY HAVE DONE

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,100
NOTHING BUT COMPLAINING ABOUT
THE CONDITIONS OVER HERE SINCE

172
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,230
THEY GOT HERE.

173
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,730
AND BRADLEY SPECIFICALLY, HE
JUST CRIES ABOUT EVERYTHING.

174
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,670
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

175
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,700
THIS IS "SURVIVOR," IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE HARD.

176
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,400
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY
IT'S SHOCKING TO THESE PEOPLE.

177
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,770
ON TOP OF, THAT WE'RE DOWN 4-5.

178
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:15,970
ALL IN ALL, NOT A GREAT SWAP FOR
ME.

179
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,000
WELCOME TO NAVITI, GUYS.

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,930
WELCOME HOME.

181
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,230
THIS IS OUR LIVING ROOM.

182
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,130
WOW, YEAH.

183
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,270
THIS IS GREAT, GUYS.

184
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,330
IT GETS A LITTLE COLD OUT HERE
DURING THE EVENING.

185
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,530
TAKE IT TO THE BEDROOM.

186
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,970
WE WRAPPED UP OUR COMFORT
RIGHT HERE.

187
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,000
WE DIDN'T HAVE TOOLS LIKE YOU
GUYS.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,970
WE HAVE OUR NIGHTTIME
FIREPLACE.

189
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,870
I'M DEFINITELY LIKE FLOORED
WHEN I ARRIVE HERE AT THE NAVITI

190
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,070
TRIBE, BECAUSE THEY REALLY GOT
IT GOING ON.

191
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,030
THEY GOT TWO FIRE PITS.

192
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,370
THEY GOT A GOOD SHELTER.

193
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,330
SURE ENOUGH, THEY GOT THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL VIEW THAT I HAVE EVER

194
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,600
SEEN IN MY LIFE.

195
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,670
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE THIS NEW TRIBE WILLING

196
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,230
GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL ANY TIME
SOON.

197
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,670
WE LOOK STRONG, YOU GUYS.

198
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,670
WE HAVE THE 5-4 ADVANTAGE,
BUT IT'S WAY MORE COMPLEX THAN

199
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,600
THAT, BECAUSE THREE OUT OF THE
FIVE I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAD

200
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,870
HUGE CONNECTIONS WITH, AND DOM
HAS AN IDOL.

201
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,430
THAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME.

202
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,770
I HAVE TO ELIMINATE IT.

203
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,670
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO
HAPPEN?

204
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,400
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

205
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,100
THERE'S NO REASON FOR US NOT TO
CARRY IT.

206
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,370
YOU NEED TO START PUTTING
YOUR ARMY INSTINCT ON AND TOP

207
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,530
THINKING WITH YOUR HEART.

208
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,500
OKAY.

209
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
YOU NEED TO --
 IF YOU WANT TO WIN, YOU NEED

210
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,030
TO START THINKING LIKE THAT.

211
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,230
LIKE I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

212
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,430
LOOK.

213
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,670
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,
DOM TOLD ME HE HAS THE IDOL.

214
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,570
HE LOOKED FOR A LONG TIME.

215
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,270
YOU THINK HE DOES?

216
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,500
HE DOES.

217
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,570
THE ONLY WAY YOU AND I ARE GOING
TO SURVIVE IS IF WE HAVE EACH

218
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,270
OTHER BOTH.

219
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,870
IF IT'S JUST ME, WE'RE SCREWED.

220
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,470
I BELIEVE THE INFORMATION
CHRIS GAVE ME ABOUT DOMENICK IS

221
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,670
TRUE.

222
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,830
NOW THAT THIS SWITCH HAS
HAPPENED, WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR

223
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,470
GAME PLAN.

224
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,030
WE NEED THE BLIND SIDE DOM.

225
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:00,400
I'M GOING ALONG WITH IT, BUT
WHEN CHRIS IS TELL ME STORIES,

226
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,770
I'M CRINGING, BUT CHRIS TALKS TO
YOU INSTEAD OF WITH YOU.

227
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,000
HE WAS GIVING ME ORDERS, FOLLOW
THIS AND STAY ON TRACK.

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,270
EVEN THOUGH I'M USED TO GUYS
BARK, ORDERS IN THE MILITARY, I

229
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,830
DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF
CONFRONTATION AT ALL.

230
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,000
HOW ARE YOU ALL ON COCONUTS?

231
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,030
LET ME ASK YOU GUYS THIS, ALL
FOUR OF YOU ARE ALIGNED,

232
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,470
DOMENICK PROBABLY HAS THE IDOL.

233
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,470
YOU THINK SO?

234
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,830
YES, I KNOW SO.

235
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,470
AN WE NEED TO GET HIM OUT.

236
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,530
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY.

237
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,670
ALL RIGHT.

238
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,830
AND I GUARANTEE YOU HE'S GOING
TO TRY TO SWOOP EVERYBODY.

239
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,300
HE WILL.

240
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,970
HE WILL.

241
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,000
YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,870
YOU GET IT.

243
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,700
HE'S NEW YORK E.

244
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,970
I'VE BEEN ON THE HIM SINCE DAY
ONE.

245
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,830
CHRIS STARTED TALKING ABOUT
HOW DOMENICK HAS A HIDDEN

246
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,400
IMMUNITY IDOL.

247
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,600
WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUT.

248
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,430
AN I WAS LIKE, WOW.

249
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,000
WELL, WELCOME TO NAVITI.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
WE GOT TO DO IT.

251
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,870
GOT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

252
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,570
SERIOUSLY, LET'S SHAKE ON IT.

253
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,500
ABSOLUTELY.

254
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,730
OKAY.

255
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,300
CHRIS HAS A BIG PERSONALITY,
SO WHEN HE TALKS TO ME, I HAVE

256
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,870
TO NOD AND SMILE, NOD AND SMILE,
AN ACT LIKE I'M JUST THIS GIRL

257
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,700
THAT HE MIGHT THINK HE CAN TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF AND JUST LICK DRAG

258
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,670
ME IN AS A NUMBER.

259
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,900
WHEN WE GET BACK WE'LL PLAY
IT ALL COOL.

260
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
I'LL PLAY DUMB, BUT I'M NOT
GOING TO BE DUMB ABOUT IT.

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,430
THAT'S AMAZING.

262
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,070
I KNOW.

263
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,130
LOOK HOW PRETTY THAT IS.

264
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,500
THERE'S IN WAY THAT COULD EVER
GET OLD.

265
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,630
IT'S FREEZING.

266
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:48,830
I JUST WANT TO BE BACK AT NAVITI
YOU GUYS HAVE DIRT.

267
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,970
WE HAD SAND EVERYWHERE.

268
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,030
I FEEL DIRTY AND GROSS.

269
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,130
OH, MY GOD.

270
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,970
NAVITI PRETTY MUCH HATES
EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR CAMP.

271
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,170
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF COMPLAINERS,
BUT I'M IN THE MINORITY ON THIS

272
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,300
NEW TRIBE, AND I HAVE TO FIND A
CRACK.

273
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,330
SOMETIMES THIS GAME JUST LIKE
LITERALLY THE LUCK OF THE DRAW.

274
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,200
CRAZY, YEAH, BUT NONE OF US
ARE GOING TO FLIP ON PURPLE, SO

275
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,000
IT SUCKS FOR YOU GUYS TO BE 5-4.

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,170
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM,
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT IT OUT.

277
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,300
YOU HAVE TO MAKE AS MANY
CONNECTIONS AS YOU.

278
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,830
CAN IT'S FRUSTRATING THAT THIS
KIND OF LUCK CAN ALL OF A

279
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,930
SUDDEN, YOU GO FROM THE TOP OF
THE FOOD CHAIN TO THE BOTTOM.

280
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,530
NO, WE'RE NOT GIVING UP.

281
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,570
SO ME AND STEPHANIE NEED TO FIND
AN IDOL.

282
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,170
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SWITCH
UP THE NUMBERS.

283
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,930
WE GO ON MAD DASH.

284
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,770
WE JUST RUN OFF INTO THE WOODS.

285
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,270
AN WE START SEARCHING UNDER
EVERY TREE.

286
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,230
EVERY ROCK, PEBBLE.

287
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,870
ANYTHING?

288
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,870
BRANCH.

289
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,300
THE WELL, TREE MAIL.

290
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,700
OH, MY GOD.

291
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,530
I'M SEEING THINGS STARTING TO
JUMP.

292
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:54,000
WE'RE DIGGING OUR HANDS IN LOGS
COVERED WITH TERMITES AND ANTS.

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,070
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO
FIND AN IDOL.

294
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,430
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ME OUT,
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ME

295
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,900
OUT FIGHTING AND SCREAMING
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO DO

296
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,700
EVERYTHING I CAN TO STAY IN THIS
GAME.

297
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,570
THIS COULD NOT HAVE WORKED
OUT MORE PERFECTLY.

298
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,730
WE VOTE THEM OUT.

299
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,670
I THINK IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE.

300
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,370
THERE'S A REAL IDOL SOMEWHERE IN
HERE.

301
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,930
NOW MORE THAN EVER THE OLD
MALOLO FOUR DECIDE WE NEED TO

302
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,200
FIND AN IDOL.

303
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,230
SO NOBODY SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF
A FEW OF US OLD MALOLO FOLKS ARE

304
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,000
OUT LOOKING FOR IDOLS.

305
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:35,030
THERE HAS TO BE A CLUE OR
SOMETHING.

306
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:44,870
THERE HAS TO BE A CLUE OR
SOMETHING.

307
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,500
WE GOT THE IDOL, BRO.

308
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,730
I AM JUST ECSTATIC.

309
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,670
I JUST FOUND THIS HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

310
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,100
THIS FOR ME IS A HUGE SHRIVER
DREAM COME TRUE.

311
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,300
CONGRATULATION, YOU'VE FOUND THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

312
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,800
THIS IS ONE OF THE AUTHENTIC
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS.

313
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,770
THIS IS GHOST.

314
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:11,400
AND THIS IS JAMES' ORIGINAL IDOL
FROM "SURVIVOR: CHINA" IN 20 OP

315
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,430
WHEN HE WENT HOME WITH TWO OF
THESE GUYS.

316
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,700
IT WAS A DECORATION ON THE
ENTRYWAY TO THE TRIBE CAMP THAT

317
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,330
NO ONE EVER SUSPECTED AS A IDOL.

318
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,070
HE PRIDE IT OFF, SURE ENOUGH,
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

319
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,600
ON DAY 30 JAMES FOUND HIMSELF IN
A VERY STRONG POSITION.

320
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,530
HE HAD A TIGHT ALLIANCE OF FIVE
AND TWO IMMUNITY IDOLS.

321
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,570
THIS COMBINATION OF POWER LULLED
HIM INTO A FALSE SENSE OF

322
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,830
SECURITY.

323
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,030
AS HIS CLOSEST ALLIES SENT HIM
HOME WITH BOTH IDOLS STILL IN

324
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,230
HIS POCKET.

325
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,700
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

326
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,900
JAMES.

327
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
JAMES IS THE ONLY PLAYER IN THE
HISTORY OF "SURVIVOR" TO BE

328
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,500
VOTED OUT WITH TWO IDOLS.

329
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,700
THE ONLY QUESTION IS CAN YOU
REVERSE THE CURSE?

330
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,670
AT EIGHT YEARS OLD, FIRST SEASON
I WATCHED WAS "SURVIVOR: CHINA"

331
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,470
AND JAMES WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE
PLAYERS.

332
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,800
I WATCHED HIM WALK HOME WITH TWO
OF THESE.

333
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
TO BE SITTING HERE 11 YEARS
LATER HOLDING THE ACTUAL IDOL

334
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,770
AND BE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO
REVERSE HIS CURSE AND CHANGE HIS

335
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,870
LEGACY IS AMAZING.

336
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,700
THIS IS HUGE, MAN.

337
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:23,570
EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE LOOKING
FOR.

338
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,900
OH, THIS LITTLE SUCKER.

339
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,670
RIGHT HERE.

340
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,300
OH, WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO
DO.

341
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,370
I'M WORRIED CHRIS IS GOING TO
TURN ON US BEFORE WE GET HIM.

342
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,230
I THINK HE'S GOING TO TAKE
ANGELA WITH HIM.

343
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,330
HIM AND ANGELA ARE TIGHT.

344
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,630
LIBBY, I LIKE HER.

345
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,700
CHRIS IS ALREADY TRYING TO
GET THEM.

346
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,070
THAT'S WHY WE GOT TO ROPE ALL
OF THEM IN, NOT JUST ONE OR TWO

347
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,870
OF THEM, WE GOT TO ROPE ALL FOUR
OF THEM IN.

348
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,970
THE EASIEST THING WOULD BE
THE FIVE OF US STICK TOGETHER.

349
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,730
I MEAN, AT LEAST ONE VOTE.

350
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,270
BUT I GET THE SENSE THAT CHRIS
DOESN'T WANT TO STAY FIVE STRONG

351
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,130
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALLY SEEM
TO HAVE A GOOD CONNECTION WITH

352
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,170
DOM.

353
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,000
SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO FOR
CHRIS.

354
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,400
I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO
GET A LITTLE PARANOID, BUT I

355
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,170
DON'T THINK YOU GUYS HAVE TO
WORRY AS OF RIGHT NOW.

356
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,130
I LOVE YOU.

357
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,600
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

358
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,970
WE WERE STOKED WHEN WE SAW YOU
HAD PURPLE.

359
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,070
CROSS MY HEART.

360
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,930
US GIRLS GOT TO STICKING
TOGETHER.

361
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,930
I AGREE.

362
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,230
IMMEDIATELY I KNEW I COULD
BOND WITH MORGAN.

363
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,000
SHE WAS SUPER OPEN AND SUPER
FRIENDLY.

364
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,670
SO I FEEL CLOSER TO MORGAN THAN
ANYONE ELSE ON THE OTHER TRIBE.

365
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:38,900
I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE A SOLID
NAVITI FIVE.

366
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,070
THE GOOD PART ABOUT PEOPLE
COMING UP TO YOU WANTING TO

367
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,170
TRUST YOU, YOU CAN CHOOSE
BETWEEN WHICH ALLIANCE YOU WANT

368
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,870
TO BE WITH.

369
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,000
I DO FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT MORGAN.

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,200
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.

371
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,570
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

372
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,330
IT'S FINALLY FEELING LIKE A REAL
ALLIANCE.

373
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,330
I HONESTLY DON'T THINK YOU
GUYS HAVE TO WORRY.

374
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:33,630
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

375
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,300

GOT TO TAKE IT BACK.

380
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,900
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BECOME UP
FOR GRABS.

381
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,270
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING THE RACE THROUGH A SERIES

382
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,330

WHERE YOU'LL DIG UP A LADDER,

383
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,130
CLIMB IT, AND RETRIEVE A ROPE.

384
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,400
WE'LL USE THE ROPE TO GET YOU TO
THE TOP OF A TAL TOWER WHERE YOU

385
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,500

LOSERS, SOMEBODY WILL BE THE
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT.

389
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,370
IN ADDITION, YOU ARE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.

00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,600

[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: ONE SIMPLE LITTLE

392
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,570
TARP WILL PROTECT YOU FROM THE
RAIN AND THE SUN.

393
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,500
AND WINNING TRIBAL SENDS
SOMEBODY FROM THE LOSING TRIBE

394
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,100
TO GHOST ISLAND.

395

BRENDAN JUST GETS THROUGH.

405
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,030
BRADLEY'S THROUGH.

YES!

413
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,600

Jeff: NAVITI HAS THEIR
LADDER.

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,630
AND YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT TO
GET SOMEBODY UP 15 FEET IN THE

GOOD JOB.

489
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,730
Jeff: SOMEBODY'S GOT TO GET
UP TOP.

490
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,300
SEBASTIAN TRIES.

491
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,970
HE CAN'T DO IT.

492
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,830
I'M GOING TO GO UP.

493
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,500

START ON THE PUZZLE.

510
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,500
WHERE'S THE FACE?

511
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,170
NO FACE, NO FACE.

512
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,600
Jeff: MALOLO TRYING TO GET
THEIR LAST GUY UP AND THEY'VE

513
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:20,900
DONE IT.

514
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,600
OKAY.

515
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,000
ON THE MAT.

516
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,230
Jeff: START ON THE PUZZLE.

517
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,530

518
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,400
Jeff: ALL THAT ADRENALINE
AND ENERGY TO GET YOU HERE.

519
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,300
NOW EXHAUSTED, YOU'VE GOT TO
SLOW DOWN AND USE YOUR BRAIN TO

520
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,470
SOLVE A COMPLICATED "SURVIVOR"
PUSS L.

521
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,900
WORK SLOW.

522
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,970
THINK ABOUT IT.

523
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,000
KELLYN AND BRADLEY FOR MALOLO.

524
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,930
WENDELL AND LAUREL FOR NAVITI.

525
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,100
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
FIRST WHAT THIS PUZZLE IS.

526
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,070
IT'S GOT TO START SMALL AT
THE BOTTOM AND GET BIGGER.

527
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,630
DON'T TELL THEM.

528
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:55,130
Amaka: TARP AND IMMUNITY ON
THE LIED.

529
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,730
-- LINE.

530
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:06,370
TARP GHOST ISLAND AND TRIBAL
COUNCIL AWAITING THE LOSERS.

531
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,300
KELLYN WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

532
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,170
IF THEY'RE RIGHT.

533
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,470
MALOLO WORKING TOGETHER VERY
WELL AS A TRIBE.

534
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,400
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

535
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,070
Jeff: WENDELL AND LAUREL
FALLING BEHIND.

536
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,570
DON'T SAY THAT, BRO.

537
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,670
Jeff: JUST CALLING WHAT I
SEE.

538
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,230
ANOTHER PIECE FROM BRADLEY AND
KELLYN.

539
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,900
NOW IT'S THE BIG PIECE MAYBE.

540
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,200
Jeff: ANOTHER PIECE FROM
BRADLEY AND KELLYN.

541
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,470
WENDELL JUST FLAT OUT LOOKING
TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.

542
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,000
HEY, BRADLEY, RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT HERE, THIS PIECE.

543
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,500
I THINK IT'S THE BIG GUY.

544
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,670
Amaka: ANOTHER PIECE BY
BRADLEY AND KELLYN.

545
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,370
THIS IS BECOMING A BLOWOUT RIGHT
NOW.

546
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,130
DECISIONS ABOUT WHO TO PUT ON
THE PUZZLE PLAYING OUT IN A BIG

547
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,570
WAY RIGHT NOW.

548
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:48,230
MALOLO MADE VERY GOOD DECISIONS
CLEARLY WITH KELLYN AND BRADLEY.

549
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:57,000
MALOLO WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD
SENDING NAVITI TO TRIBAL

550
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,600
COUNCIL.

551
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,070
MALOLO, CONGRATULATIONS.

552
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,000
A DOMINANT VICTORY OUT OF THE
GATE.

553
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,970
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

554
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,030
IN ADDITION, NICE TARP.

555
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:14,000
COME GRAB YOUR REWARD.

556
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,230
ALL RIGHT.

557
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,430
NAVITI, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE THIRD

558
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,830
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

559
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,100
AND SOMEBODY'S GOING GHOST
ISLAND, AND MALOLO, YOU'RE GOING

560
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,170
TO DECIDE WHO THAT IS.

561
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,300
IT NEEDS TO BE UNANIMOUS
DECISION, BUT IF IT'S NOT

562
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,530
UNANIMOUS, NAVITI WILL DRAW
ROCKS.

563
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,730
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE A DECISION,
YOU LEAVE IT UP TO CHANCE.

564
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,400
DOES ANYONE DISSENT AGAINST
DONATHAN?

565
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,670
I DISSENT.

566
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,670
DRAW ROCKS.

567
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,870
DRAWING ROCKS.

568
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,370
Jeff: WALK ME THROUGH THAT,
BRADLEY.

569
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,600
WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT THIS GROUP
CAN'T MAKE ONE DECISION?

570
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,500
WELL, THERE'S FIVE US FROM
FORMER NAVITI, AND WE OBVIOUSLY

571
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,070
WANT TO SEND AN ORIGINAL MALOLO,
SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE GUYS

572
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,570
DISSENT.

573
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,430
I DON'T BLAME THEM.

574
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,800
I'D DO THE SAME IF I WERE THEM.

575
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,900
Jeff: THERE ARE EIGHT BLACK
ROCKS AND ONE WHITE ROCK.

576
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,730
WHITE GOES TO GHOST ISLAND.

577
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,130
REACH IN AND TAKE A ROCK.

578
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,470
DON'T LOOK.

579
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:24,200
KEEP IT IN YOUR PALM.

580
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,900
EVERYBODY HOLD YOUR PALMS OUT.

581
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:33,400
EVERYONE REVEAL.

582
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,170
CHRIS.

583
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,600
Jeff: CHRIS HAS THE WHITE
ROCK.

584
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
CHRIS WILL BE GOING TO GHOST
ISLAND.

585
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,430
CAN NOT BE VOTED OUT OF
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

586
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,700
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

587
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,100
THE BAD NEWS IS YOU'LL BE OUT OF
THE SOCIAL POLITICS AND HAVE NO

588
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
SAY IN WHO DOES GO HOME.

589
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,600
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT THE
GHOST ISLAND.

590
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,430
BEST OF LUCK, GUYS.

591
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,970
SEE YOU LATER.

592
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:57,270
THAT SON OF A BITCH CHRIS IS
LUCKY, BECAUSE I WAS REALLY

593
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,570
LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING RID
OF HIM AT TRIBAL TONIGHT.

594
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,030
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, MALOLO, NO
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

595
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,730
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

596
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,570
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

597
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,730
NAVITI, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL.

598
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,530
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

599
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,930
I AM FREAKING OUT.

600
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,470
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS SEASON
IS ABOUT PLAYERS' PAST MISTAKES,

601
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,330
AND IT'S GOING TO BE 4-4
TONIGHT.

602
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,330
I'M WORRIED WE'RE GOING TO MESS
THIS UP.

603
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
DAY NINE JUST TURNED INTO A
NIGHTMARE.

604
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,330
WE LOSE OUR CHALLENGE AND I GET
SENT HERE TO GHOST ISLAND.

605
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,600
FRANKLY, I'M SPOOKED ABOUT IT.

606
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,430
YOU KNOW, TONIGHT I'M MISSING A
HUGE TRIBAL COUNCIL IN WHICH I

607
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,130
WAS POLITICIAN A BIG ROLE IN
WHAT COULD HAPPEN.

608
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:04,700
I HOPE MY PLAN STAYS ELIMINATING
DOM IN A BLINDSIDE.

609
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,900
BUT YOU KNOW I'M SCARED WITHOUT
ME BEING THERE MAYBE IT MIGHT

610
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,700
NOT HAPPEN.

611
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,370
ALL RIGHT.

612
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,030
HERE WE GO.

613
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,570
NOPE.

614
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,500
NOT TODAY.

615
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,770
NO GAME FOR YOU.

616
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,000
AIN'T THAT A BUMMER.

617
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,270
I WAS HOPING I COULD WIN AN IDOL
OR SOME SORT OF ADVANTAGE, BUT

618
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,130
INSTEAD I'M BY MYSELF.

619
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,030
BEING OUT HERE, IT'S NOT EASY.

620
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,500
I'M HUNGRY.

621
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,700
I MISS MY FAMILY.

622
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,400
CRAZY.

623
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,130
I JUST -- IT'S JUST WHAT THE
GAME DOES TO YOU MENTALLY.

624
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,870
I EXPECTED THIS TO HAPPEN AT
SOME POINT.

625
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:51,300
THIS IS JUST -- THIS HAS BEEN
FIRST DIFFICULT DAY FOR ME.

626
00:27:51,300 --> 00:28:01,230
AROUND THE TRIBE WHEN I'M
STRUGGLING, I HAVE TO BURY IT TO

627
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,870
BE STRONG FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

628
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,770
MY MOM WAS DIAGNOSED WITH M.S.

629
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,470
YEARS BEFORE I WAS EVEN BORN.

630
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,430
MY MOM IS MY HERO.

631
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:14,070
I SORT OF -- WHEN I HIT A MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS, I THINK OF HER.

632
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,800
SHE'S THE ULTIMATE SURVIVOR.

633
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,600
SHE WAS DIAGNOSED AT 27.

634
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,170
TEN YEARS AGO SHE WAS TOLD SHE
HAD TWO MONTHS TO LIVE AND SHE'S

635
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,330
STILL ALIVE.

636
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:30,400
EVER SINCE THEN I MADE IT MY
DUTY TO REMAIN STRONG FOR HER.

637
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
WHICH HELPS ME WHEN I'M IN A
TRIBE.

638
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,730
YOU HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS.

639
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,970
BUT I'M HUMAN, AND GHOST ISLAND
IS GIVING ME A CHANCE TO LET OUT

640
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:48,400
ALL OF MY NEGATIVE ENERGY SO I
CAN REBOOT AND BE THAT AGAIN FOR

641
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,630
MYSELF.

642
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,700
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I WAS THIS
UPSET THINKING ABOUT MY MOM, IT

643
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,670
WAS AWESOME, AND THAT CONNECTION
REALLY HELPED ME.

644
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,570
IT'S CRUCIAL THAT I RECENTER
MYSELF, BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO

645
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:12,600
BETTER MY GAME GOING FORWARD.

646
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:19,430
BETTER MY GAME GOING FORWARD.

647
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,700
THAT SUCKED.

648
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,670
I BET HE'S HAPPY.

649
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,800
HE'S GOT ALL THE RICE TO
HIMSELF, A BIG BED FOR HIS BIG

650
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,030
HEAD.

651
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,470
WHAT I SEE HAPPENING TODAY IS
THE FOUR MALOLO WILL VOTE FOR

652
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,030
DOMENICK BECAUSE THEY'RE KEEPING
TO CHRIS'S PLAN.

653
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:45,000
I GOT A TON OF SAND IN MY
DRAWERS AND THAT WATER LOOKED

654
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,530
REALLY NICE.

655
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,330
I GOT THE TAKE A DIP.

656
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:51,530
I DECIDED I WASN'T GOING TO
GO WITH CHRIS, I WASN'T GOING TO

657
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,670
GO AGAINST MY TEAM.

658
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,630
I WOULD RATHER HAVE LOYALTY
AGAINST DOING SOMETHING I'M

659
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,970
CONTROLLED AT AND NOT HAVING A
CHOICE IN.

660
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:03,070
HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING ABOUT
WORST-CASE SCENARIOS FOR TODAY?

661
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,770
CHRIS, TALK TO ME.

662
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,970
HE'S STILL ON DOM.

663
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,730
CHRIS SAID MAKE SURE YOU
STICK WITH THE PLAN, MEANING

664
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,230
VOTE WITH THE OTHER FOUR.

665
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,030
THEN THEY WILL SEND DOM HOME.

666
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,930
I DON'T WANT TO VOTE WITH
THEM.

667
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:19,630
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, I'M
NOT VOTING ONE OF US OFF.

668
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:23,930
I'M EXPECTING A SPLIT VOTE, 4-4,
THAT WE'LL HAVE TO PULL ROCKS,

669
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,000
BUT I AM WILLING TO GO TO ROCKS
FOR OLD NAVITI.

670
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,470
I'M STAYING STRONG WITH MY TEAM.

671
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,030
SO WHO WOULD YOU THINK TO VOTE
OFF.

672
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,230
NAVITI.

673
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,930
SNOW SO WORST-CASE SCENARIO,
THEY ALL VOTE DOM, WE VOTE

674
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,170
LIBBY, IT WILL BE THE ROCK DRAW.

675
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,930
ANGELA WANTS TO STAY NAVITI
STRONG, BUT IT'S A LITTLE

676
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,000
SKETCHY TO ME.

677
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,070
SHE'S CHRIS'S RIGHT-HAND MAN.

678
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,730
SO WHATEVER OUR CONVERSATION
WAS, IT DIDN'T HOLD A LOT OF

679
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,930
WEIGHT TO ME.

680
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,700
I DON'T WANT THE DRAW ROCKS FOR
ANGELA, SO I'M GUNG HO ABOUT

681
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,670
GETTING HER OUT OF HERE.

682
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,930
I WAS SO READY TO PULL THE
TRIGGER.

683
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,370
CHRIS IS JUST A LOOSE CANNON.

684
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,370
TODAY WAS HIS DAY.

685
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,870
HE HAS NO POWER IF WE GET HIS
RIGHT-HAND MAN.

686
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,170
ALL RIGHT, COOL, ANGELA.

687
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,500
WELL, HE HAS LIBBY IN HIS
POCKET.

688
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,770
NO, SHE'S NOT.

689
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,900
YEAH, SHE'S WITH US.

690
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,700
ALL RIGHT.

691
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,600
WELL THAT'S EASY.

692
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,570
ANGELA THINKS THAT LIBBY IS
GOING HOME.

693
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:22,930
BUT I TRUST LIBBY WAY MORE THAN
I WOULD EVER TRUST ANGELA.

694
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:27,630
YOU WANT THE TAKE OUT ANGELA?

695
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,000
A COMPLETE BLINDSIDE AND
UNANIMOUS MOUSE.

696
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,100
WE ARE ON YOUR SIDE, WE'RE ON
YOUR TEAM.

697
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,400
I SWEAR.

698
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,470
THE PLAN IS TO GET ANGELA OUT
NOW TO SHOW THEM THAT WE'RE ON

699
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,130
THEIR SIDE.

700
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,100
ACT LIKE YOU'RE ALL TOGETHER.

701
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,870
I HAVE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND
THIS FEAR THAT THE FORMER MALOLO

702
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,900
FOUR WILL GO BACK TO THINKING
ABOUT ME BEING A THREAT TO THEM.

703
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,370
SO I MAY EXPOSE THIS FAKE IDOL
TO THE TRIBE SO THEY CAN GAIN

704
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,430
SOME TRUST FOR ME.

705
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,900
CHRIS DAY ONE AFTER ME.

706
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,200
CHRIS DAY TWO AFTER ME.

707
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,470
CHRIS DAY THREE AFTER ME.

708
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,770
AND ON LIKE DAY THREE OR FOUR HE
SAYS TO ME, DO YOU HAVE AN IDOL.

709
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,370
I GO, NO, I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.

710
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,570
HE SAID, IF YOU DID, I'D SEE WE
COULD TRUST EACH OTHER AND I'D

711
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,170
BE OFF YOUR BACK.

712
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,430
SO I SAW THIS AT ONE OF THE
CHALLENGE, I BUNDLED IT, CHEESY

713
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,830
ROPE, BUT IT'S JUST TREE MAIL.

714
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,800
OH, MY GOD.

715
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,270
SO I MEAN, IT'S A REALLY NICE
SHELL, I EVEN TRIED IT ON FOR

716
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,030
HIM AND EVERYTHING.

717
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,600
I SHOWED IT TO HIM.

718
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,300
BUT IT'S WORTHLESS.

719
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,970
THIS IS THE NONSENSE HE'S BEEN
TALKING ABOUT FROM DAY ONE, ALL

720
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,470
RIGHT.

721
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,600
SO ARE WE GOOD?

722
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,200
NAVITI WANTS US TO VOTE
ANGELA OUT, BUT I SEE DOMENICK

723
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,530
AND I TRULY THINK HE'S CAPABLE
OF LYING STRAIGHT TO MY FACE.

724
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,770
I'M YOUR NUMBER.

725
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,970
IT COULD BE THE CASE THAT HE
HAS A REAL IDOL AND WANTED TO

726
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,700
THROW US OFF HIS PATH BY SHOWING
US THE FAKE IDOL.

727
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,970
FOR REAL ON MY CHILDREN I
WANT TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS.

728
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,670
I'M IN THE SAYING THAT.

729
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,030
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.

730
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,870
AIM WITH YOU GUYS.

731
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,600
100%.

732
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,230
IF ANYONE HAS TO GO, I SWEAR
ON MY CHILDREN AND FAMILY,

733
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,100
THAT'S A BAD SIGN.

734
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,430
IF DOMENICK IS VOTING FOR
ANGELA, WHOEVER VOTES FOR US

735
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:22,170
GOES HOME BECAUSE NAVITI ONLY
HAS THREE LEFT SOME WE CAN

736
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,770
CHOOSE ONE. ONE, THOUGH.

737
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,000
MORGAN.

738
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,230
BECAUSE OF THE IDOL.

739
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,770
I WASN'T KEEN ON THAT IDEA
BECAUSE MORGAN IS SOMEONE I CAN

740
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:33,130
TRUST, SO I'D RATHER NOT BRING
HER UP IN THIS VOTE, BECAUSE I'D

741
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,930
LIKE THE KEEP HER AROUND AS LONG
AS I CAN.

742
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:42,600
DOMENICK COULD'DLY HAVE A
REAL IDOL AND BE SHOWING US THE

743
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,770
FAKE IDOL TO THROW US OFF.

744
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,200
I DOUBT HE HAS AN IDOL.

745
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,670
YOU DOUBT IT, BUT WHAT IF HE
DOES?

746
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,330
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOING
TO NEED WENDELL AND MORGAN IN

747
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:53,870
CHALLENGES.

748
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,800
WE DON'T NEED ANGELA.

749
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,230
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS, THE
FACT IS ALL FOUR OF US NEED TO

750
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:05,600
HAVE THE SAME TARGET, SO WE NEED
TO AGREE QUICKLY BEFORE TRIBAL.

751
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,630
I DON'T WANT TO VOTE OUT
MORGAN.

752
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,400
I FEEL LIKE IT WILL BE A LOT
EASIER TO JUST VOTE OUT ANGELA

753
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,670
AND IT BE UNANIMOUS VOTE.

754
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:17,900
THE BIG QUESTION IS WILL WE BANK
ON THE ALLIANCES WE DID MAKE IN

755
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,730
THE ORIGINAL MALOLO, OR WILL WE
BLEND TOGETHER?

756
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,000
THIS DECISION REALLY TURNS THE
GAME.

757
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
EVERY DAY THE STAKES KEEP
GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER.

758
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,270
Jeff: IF IT'S YOUR FIRST
TIME THE TRIBAL, BEHIND YOU A

759
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,030
TORCH.

760
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,300
GRAB ONE, DIP IT IN, AND GET
FIRE.

761
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,200
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

762
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,000
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

763
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,400
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

764
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,770
ALL RIGHT, SO MORGAN, YOU GO
BACK THE CAMP WITH CHRIS AT

765
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,000
GHOST ISLAND 4-4.

766
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,830
YEAH, WE PRETTY MUCH SPLIT UP
INTO OUR GROUP OF FOUR, BUT AS

767
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:29,370
OF RIGHT NOW, BOTH TRIBES ARE
STAYING SOLID WITH THEIR GROUP.

768
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,330
Jeff: WENDELL, IS THAT
REALLY IT?

769
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,300
IT WAS JUST ONE GROUP OF FOUR
AND ANOTHER GROUP OF FOUR?

770
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,630
YEAH, WE WERE ON THE BED
PLOTTING TOGETHER.

771
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,370
THEY WERE OVER IN THE LIVING
ROOM PLOTTING SOME KIND OF

772
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,530
STRATEGY.

773
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,900
ALL YOU CAN HOPE FOR IS FOR
SOMEONE TO MAYBE CRACK, MAYBE

774
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,130
PULL SOMEBODY OVER.

775
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,670
Jeff: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
PULL SOMEBODY OVER IF THEY'RE IN

776
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,270
THE LIVING ROOM AND THEY'RE IN
THE KITCHEN?

777
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,700
GOOD QUESTION.

778
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,730
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET OUT
OF THE KITCHEN AND GO TALK TO

779
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,770
SOMEBODY.

780
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,430
Jeff: DOMENICK, ARE YOU
SURPRISED THAT IT WAS SO

781
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,200
SEPARATED GIVEN THIS IS FOR
SOMEBODY A MILLION DOLLAR VOTE

782
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,600
TONIGHT.

783
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,930
YEAH, JEFF.

784
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,730
IF THIS GOES 4-4, I KNOW I DON'T
WANT MY FATE TO BE DETERMINED BY

785
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,100
A ROCK, SO I ACTUALLY DID STEP
OUT OF THE KITCHEN A LITTLE BIT,

786
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,870
AND I JUST EXPLORED THE
SITUATION TO SEE IF THERE WERE

787
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,630
ANY CRACKS, JUST TO SEE WHAT
EVERYONE'S THINKING.

788
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,070
Jeff: ANGELA, HOW ABOUT FOR
YOU?

789
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,430
WHAT DID YOU SEE WHEN YOU GOT
BACK THE CAMP.

790
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,970
I GOT OUT OF THE KITCHEN, AS
WELL, AND TALKED.

791
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,100
AND TONIGHT I'M ON THE FENCE.

792
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,730
I CAN GO WITH THE POPULAR
DECISION OR THE RIGHT DECISION

793
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,900
FOR ME.

794
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,230
BUT I'VE GOTTEN AN IMMENSE
AMOUNT OF PRESSURE, SO RIGHT NOW

795
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,000
I WANT IT TO BE MY DECISION FOR
ME.

796
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,370
I AM STUNNED BY WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING RIGHT.

797
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,630
NOW WHEN WERE YOU PRESSURED?

798
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:42,230
WHEN WE SWAPPED TRIBES, CHRIS
STARTED TRYING TO PULL MALOLO'S

799
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,500
MEMBERS OVER TO US.

800
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,170
AND IT WAS MORE PRESSURE VERSUS
ANYBODY ELSE HAVING AN OPINION.

801
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,970
CHRIS ISN'T HERE.

802
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,030
CHRIS IS GONE.

803
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,570
Jeff: SO MORGAN, DO YOU
THINK THERE IS CHANCE THAT

804
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,470
DESPITE CHRIS, THAT IT COULD
ACTUALLY MAKE THE FOUR NAVITI

805
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,030
HERE TONIGHT TIGHTER?

806
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,670
I THINK SO.

807
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:01,200
I FEEL LIKE WE ALL HAVE REALLY
GOOD RELATIONSHIPS.

808
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,670
BUT YOU KNOW, FOUR NEW PEOPLE
GOT ADDED, SO WE'RE TRYING TO

809
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,430
BUILD OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH
THEM, AS WELL.

810
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,270
Jeff: DOMENICK, ARE YOU
FEELING THAT?

811
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,430
ARE YOU FEELING DIFFERENT
RELATIONSHIP, AS WELL?

812
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,370
ABSOLUTELY.

813
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,870
I FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH
THIS NEW FOUR.

814
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,070
I FEEL A SENSE OF NEW
POSSIBILITY.

815
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,230
AND I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO HEAR
PEOPLE OUT.

816
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,370
OKAY.

817
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,730
I WANT THE HEAR WHAT PEOPLE HAVE
TO SAY, AND I'LL MAKE A

818
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,200
DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR
NOT I WANT TO GO AHEAD WITH THAT

819
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,470
OR NOT.

820
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,170
Jeff: JAMES, EVERYBODY HAS
WITHIN PAINTING THIS BEAUTIFUL

821
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,930
LITTLE PICTURE THAT ONE GROUP OF
FOUR ARE OVER HERE AND ANOTHER

822
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,900
GROUP IS OVER HERE, BUT THE MORE
QUESTIONS I ASK, THE LESS

823
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,700
ACCURATE THAT SEEMS TO BE.

824
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,330
YES, I AM KIND OF SURPRISED.

825
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,700
I MEAN, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IT
WAS A STRONG NAVITI FOUR.

826
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,930
MAYBE IT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE
ACTUALLY.

827
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,930
YOU KNOW?

828
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,000
Jeff: OR MORGAN, MAYBE THIS
IS PART OF A PLAN.

829
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,830
YOU CAN'T EVER KNOW WHAT TO
TRUST AT TRIBAL.

830
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,970
YEAH.

831
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,770
RIGHT NOW WE COULD ALL BE
SITTING HERE COMPLETELY LYING,

832
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,600
OR WE COULD ALL BE TELLING THE
TRUTH.

833
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,030
ARE WE ALL GOOD ACTORS AND
ACTRESSES, OR ARE WE BEING REAL?

834
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,500
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

835
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,800
LIBBY, HOW DO YOU DISCERN
WHEN IT'S OKAY TO LIE TO

836
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,800
SOMEBODY AND WHEN YOU NEED TO BE
HONEST?

837
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,000
I LIKE THAT YOU ASKED ME THAT
QUESTION.

838
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,630
Jeff: WHY DO YOU LIKE I
ASKED YOU?

839
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,870
PEOPLE THINK THE NICE GIRL,
THE SWEET ONE IS NOT OKAY WITH

840
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,900
LYING, BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE
EVERYONE BELIEVES YOU IF YOU

841
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,530
WANT SOMETHING DONE, SO YOU HAVE
TO BE OKAY WITH FIBBING

842
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,930
SOMETIMES, BUT THAT'S JUST THE
GAME.

843
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,270
Jeff: MORGAN, EVEN AS LIBBY
WAS SAYING IT, THE SMILE WAS

844
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,630
GROWING BIGGER, THE CHARM MORE
BROAD.

845
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,000
I MEAN, LOOK AT HER.

846
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,430
YOU JUST WANT TO TRUST HER.

847
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,000
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

848
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,230
SHE'S GORGEOUS.

849
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,670
IT'S LIKE HOW COULD THIS GIRL
EVER LIE, BUT THAT'S PART OF THE

850
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,230
GAME.

851
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,570
EVERYONE IS LYING.

852
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,870
EVEN LIBBY.

853
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,230
I'M SURE WILL LIE OR HAS LIED AT
SOME POINT.

854
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,300
Jeff: SO WENDELL, AS YOU
SIT HERE, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS

855
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,930
GOING TO HAPPEN.

856
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,100
JUST BIG PICTURE?

857
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,570
I'D LIKE THE HOPE THAT
SOMEONE MAKES A MOVE AND THAT AT

858
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,200
THE END OF TONIGHT WE'RE A
STRONGER TRIBE AND WE WANT TO

859
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,900
WORK TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY START
WINNING SOME THINGS.

860
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,400
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

861
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,230
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

862
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:19,100
LAUREL, YOU'RE UP.

863
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:59,330
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

864
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,470
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

865
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:07,400
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

866
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,370
OKAY.

867
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,670
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

868
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,170
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

869
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,400
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

870
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,800
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

871
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,030
FIRST VOTE LIBBY.

872
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,430
ANGELA.

873
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,800
ANGELA.

874
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,700
ANGELA.

875
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,970
THAT'S THREE VOTES ANGELA, ONE
VOTE LIBBY.

876
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,430
MORGAN.

877
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,870
MORGAN.

878
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:47,330
THAT'S THREE VOTES ANGELA, TWO
VOTES MORGAN, ONE VOTE LIBBY.

879
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,530
MORGAN.

880
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,770
WE'RE TRIED, THREE VOTES ANGELA,
THREE VOTES MORGAN, ONE VOTE

881
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,800
LIBBY, ONE VOTE LEFT.

882
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,630
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND,"

883
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,330
MORGAN.

884
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,600
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

885
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:18,470
WHAT?

886
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:22,030
Jeff: MORGAN, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

887
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,030
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

888
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:38,000
DON'T TRUST THE CUTE BLOND.

889
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,370
Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL CENTERED AROUND WHETHER

890
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,970
YOU WERE LOCKED IN OR SOMEBODY
WAS GOING THE MAKE A MOVE.

891
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,000
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY MADE A
MOVE.

892
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,900
THAT IS HOW YOU PLAY "SURVIVOR."

893
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,400
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

894
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:49,800
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

895
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,800
GOOD NIGHT.

896
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.

897
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,130
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," WHEN THERE'S NOWHERE

898
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:19,000
TO RUN --
 WE MADE ENEMIES.

899
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,670
Jeff:  -- AND NOWHERE TO
HIDE.

900
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:27,570
IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I
HAVE SO MUCH MORE GAME TO PLAY.

901
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,670
Jeff: YOU HAVE TO STAY
ALIVE.

902
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,600
WE CAN OPEN THIS GAME UP.

903
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,670
LET'S MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

904
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,870
I ACTUALLY HAVE THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.

905
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,570
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO DO ME
GOOD.

906
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,730
OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

907
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,870
SO THIS MIGHT BE CURSED NOW, BUT
I AM WILLING THE ADVANTAGE TO

908
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,700
DOMENICK.

909
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,070
HE WAS ALWAYS OPEN AND HONEST
WITH ME.

910
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:50,930
HOPEFULLY THIS ISN'T A CURSE.

911
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,930
IF IT IS I'M REALLY SORRY.
