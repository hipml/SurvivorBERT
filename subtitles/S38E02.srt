1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:06,606
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE KAMA TRIBE,

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,309
THE RETURNING PLAYERS WERE ON
THE OUTS.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,177
SOMEONE NEEDS TO WIN THIS
GAME.

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,114
I DONT WANT THE PLAY WITH
RETURNERS, BECAUSE THEYVE HAD

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,281
THEIR CHANCE.

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:20,253
Jeff: AT THE MANU TRIBE,
REEM AND WENDY WERE ISOLATING

7
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,288
THEMSELVES.

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,158
THOSE MIGHT BE THE THREE WE
WERE WANTING TO VOTE OUT ANY

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,727
WAY.

10
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,530
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
REEM DUG HER OWN GRAVE.

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,665
MY NAME GOT THROWN OUT TODAY.

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,134
IM PISSED OFF.

13
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,802
BUT THAT IS PART OF THIS
GAME.

14
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,504
IM NOT DONE.

15
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,905
WHATEVER.

16
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,107
Jeff: AND WAS FIRST PERSON
VOTED OUT.

17
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,376
Jeff: REEM, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

18
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,179
THANKS.

19
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,349
Jeff: AND THE FIRST PERSON
TO FACE A NEW TWIST.

20
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,517
WHAT?

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,587
Jeff: GO HOME OR GRAB THE
TORCH AND GO TO THE EDGE OF

22
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:59,692
EXTINCTION.

23
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:06,466
♪
♪

24
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:11,271
♪
♪

25
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,191
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I AM.

26
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,827
AND I STILL DONT KNOW WHATS
GOING ON.

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,562
BUT THEY DONT KNOW IM HERE.

28
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,632
LIKE I HOPE TO SHOW MY FACE
AGAIN AND BE LIKE, LOOK WHAT

29
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,733
JUST HAPPENED.

30
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,203
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LOVE THAT.

31
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:50,243
BUT AGAIN, LIKE WHAT DO I HAVE
TO GO THROUGH FOR THIS SECOND

32
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,012
CHANCE?

33
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,248
THIS IS THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

34
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,651
YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK HARD FOR
EVERYTHING.

35
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:03,623
WHEN FEAR OR LONELINESS SETS IN,
YOU MUST FIND THE RESOLVE TO

36
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,158
OVERCOME.

37
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:09,996
IF AT ANY POINT YOU WISH TO END
YOUR ADVENTURE, RAISE THE SAIL

38
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,932
AND A BOAT WILL PICK YOU UP.

39
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,968
WHAT?

40
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:20,140
THERES NO TIME LINE ON THIS?

41
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,441
EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

42
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,945
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

43
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,617
IM STRANDED.

44
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,923
NOW I GOT NOTHING BETTER TO DO
BUT ANALYZE WHY I GOT VOTED OFF.

45
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,258
IM SO DISAPPOINTED.

46
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,294
LIKE WHY DIDNT I NOTICE I WAS
SEEMING NAGGY.

47
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,030
I JUST DIDNT WANT THEM TO BE
HURT.

48
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,966
INSTEAD I BLEW MY CHANCE.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,705
I JUST DONT WANT TO EMBARRASS
MY KIDS.

50
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,574
THERE HAS TO BE A GOOD REASON TO
LEAVE THEM.

51
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,277
IM NOT A QUITTER THOUGH, MAN,
YOU KNOW?

52
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,378
IM NOT A QUITTER.

53
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:08,888
IM NOT A QUITTER.

54
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,525
I DO NOT WANT TO DISAPPOINT MY
FAMILY.

55
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:22,602
THATS WHATS KEEPING ME FROM
RAISING THAT DAMN SAIL.

56
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:30,109
THATS WHATS KEEPING ME FROM
RAISING THAT DAMN SAIL.

57
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,945
THIS IS FUNNY.

58
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,346
HOW ARE YOUR HANDS?

59
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,981
OH, MY GOD.

60
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,084
LOOKING LIKE AN OLD LADY.

61
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,721
BY MY PEDICURE STILL LOOKS
GREAT.

62
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,824
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT
LAST NIGHT?

63
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,726
SEVERAL PEOPLE TRIED TO GET YOU
TO COME OVER, RIGHT?

64
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,697
I UNDERSTAND REEM WAS DEAD IN
THE WATER, BUT I DIDNT WANT TO

65
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,998
SIDE WITH KELLEY.

66
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,900
KELLEY HAS PLAYED TWO TIMES
BEFORE.

67
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,068
WEVE SEEN HER GAME PLAY.

68
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,703
WE KNOW HOW SHE PLAYS.

69
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,104
ITS NOT HER FIRST RODEO, AND IF
YOU GUYS KEEP GOING WITH THE

70
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,807
NUMBERS, THEY WILL CONTROL THE
GAME.

71
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,444
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, MY STRONGEST
ALLY REEM WAS VOTED OUT.

72
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,480
NOW I FEEL LIKE IM THE NEXT IN
LINE.

73
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,214
I BLAME KELLEY.

74
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,549
SHES THE RINGLEADER.

75
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,885
IT MAKES ME SO ANGRY.

76
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,722
KELLEY HAS PLAYED TWO TIMES
BEFORE THIS.

77
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,924
FOR ME, SHES HAD HER SHOT.

78
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,426
TWO TIMES YOU CANT DO IT, THEN
YOU CANT DO IT.

79
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:25,265
DONT TRY TO MESS UP FIRST-TIME
PLAYERS GAMES.

80
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,401
SHE HAS THIS PERSONALITY WHERE
SHE TRIES TO BECOME YOUR FRIEND.

81
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,270
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EATING THAT
UP.

82
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:30,937
NOT I.

83
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,273
I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH THAT.

84
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:33,973
LOOK OVER THERE.

85
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,074
SHES ALREADY WORKING HER MAGIC.

86
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,242
RIGHT, RIGHT.

87
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,911
I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS
HAVE THE POWER TO GET HER OUT.

88
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,582
LISTEN, I THINK YOUR CONCERNS
ARE TOTALLY LEGITIMATE.

89
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,716
YEAH.

90
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,987
BUT TO BE HONEST, I DONT
THINK THIS PART OF THE CAMP

91
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,956
RIGHT NOW IS A GOOD TIME FOR
THIS CONVERSATION.

92
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,759
DAVID, THE OTHER
SECOND-CHANCE PLAYER, I THINK

93
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,862
ITS RESONATING IN HIM, BUT
RIGHT NOW HES PLAYING MORE OF A

94
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:56,629
GO-WITH-THE-FLOW KIND OF GAME.

95
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,031
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

96
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,200
BUT I THINK HES WITH ME.

97
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,638
SO IF RICK AND DAVID ARE ON
BOARD WITH IT, THEN I JUST NEED

98
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,941
ONE MORE VOTE.

99
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,311
WE HAVE TO WATCH NOW.

100
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,912
100%.

101
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,615
WE HAVE TO BE REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY CAREFUL.

102
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,819
WE HAVE TO KEEP CLOSE TABS ON
WENDY NOW.

103
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,953
SHELL BE IDOL HUNTING.

104
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,725
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND
WENDYS POSITION, BECAUSE IVE

105
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,326
BEEN THERE.

106
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,760
I HAVE BEEN ON THE BOTTOM.

107
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,228
I HAVE BEEN THE TARGET.

108
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,231
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT FEELS.

109
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,101
SHES TRYING TO GET SOMETHING
GOING, AND HAVING SOMEONE IN

110
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,338
CAMP WHO IS FREAKING OUT AND
KNOWS THEYRE ON THE BOTTOM IS

111
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,339
VERY DANGEROUS.

112
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:44,444
I THINK SHES TRYING TO SWAP
AND TAKE US OUT.

113
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,378
LIABILITY.

114
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,347
SHES PROBABLY GOING TO LOOK
FOR AN IDOL.

115
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,116
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GOING OUT
AS A GROUP?

116
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,285
DOESNT MATTER WHO GETS IT.

117
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,454
OH, AN OPEN IDOL HUNT?

118
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,155
YEAH.

119
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,491
WE CANT LET WENDY FIND THE
IDOL.

120
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,061
I MEAN, EVERYONE ELSE WORKED
WITH ME AT THE LAST TRIBAL, AND

121
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,797
IM GETTING THE SENSE THEY WANT
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ME.

122
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,201
BUT ANY TIME YOUR NAME IS THROWN
OUT THERE, ITS LIKE WHAT, IF

123
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,971
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THESE THINGS
CATCH FIRE SOME AT THIS POINT

124
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,874
ITS WENDY ON THIS SIDE AND ME
ON THIS SIDE, AND WERE

125
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,510
BASICALLY GOING TO BATTLE, AND
ONE OF US IS GOING TO WIN THE

126
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:25,451
WAR.

127
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,420
WE NEED A SONG AND A DANCE.

128
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,589
YOU HAVE CHOREOGRAPHY?

129
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:36,462
FOR THE NEXT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE -- COME KAMA, KAMA,

130
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,731
KAMA.

131
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,301
YOU BEND OVER IN FRONT OF ME.

132
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:46,072
[LAUGHTER]
KAMA.

133
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,908
MORALE I THINK IS A HUGE
REASON WHY WERE DOING WELL IN

134
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,177
THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, WHY WE WON
THE OTHER DAY.

135
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,312
YOU HAVE TO BE IN A POSITIVE
PLACE.

136
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:58,651
WE NEED TO FEEL BONDED, AND FOR
US, DANCING HAS BECOME OUR

137
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:03,256
THING.

138
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,725
K-A-M-A, KAMA, KAMA, KAMA.

139
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,759
TO THE FRONT.

140
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,763
ITS PUMP, PUMP, PUMP, AND KAMA.

141
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:17,136
I HATE KUM BA YAH SURVIVOR,
BUT ITS THE WORST.

142
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,338
I WANT TO BLEND IN WITH EVERYONE
ELSE.

143
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,974
I LIKE GOING TO TRIBAL FIRST
WHEN I PLAY "SURVIVOR," BECAUSE

144
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,509
YOU SEE IMMEDIATELY WHERE THE
LINES ARE.

145
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,077
YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH IT.

146
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:30,183
WHEN ITS CONSUME "KUMBAYA" AND
IS, I JUST WON FIRST CHALLENGE,

147
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,620
YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON.

148
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,223
I HAVENT REALLY TALKED TO
ANYONE.

149
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,927
HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING ABOUT
RETURNING IN GENERAL?

150
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,299
IM GLAD THAT YOU GUYS ARE
HERE.

151
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:50,470
BUT LIKE MOVING FORWARD, IS
THAT SOMETHING THAT INTERESTS

152
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:50,870
YOU?

153
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,538
YEAH, YEAH.

154
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,609
EVERYONES GOING TO BE SCARED OF
JOE THE FURTHER ALONG WE GET,

155
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,912
BUT THAT TIME IS NOWHERE NEAR
HERE, AND THINGS CAN CHANGE

156
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,313
BEFORE THEM.

157
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,547
COOL.

158
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,817
IM FINDING IT FRUSTRATING
THAT THESE NEWBIES ARENT BEING

159
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,454
FORTHCOMING ABOUT THEIR
PERCEPTION OF RETURNING PLAYERS.

160
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,390
I KNOW JOE AND I ARE UNDER
MAGNIFYING GLASS.

161
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,760
WERE LIKE THESE ANTS THAT
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT REAL HARD,

162
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,164
AND IM AFRAID THE SUN IS GOING
TO COME AND ZAP US THE HELL OFF

163
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,335
THIS CAMP.

164
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,104
AUBRY IS CLEARLY TRYING TO
MAKE SURE SHES NOT FIRST ONE

165
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,074
OUT FROM OUR TRIBE, BECAUSE
AUBRY APPROACHED ME AND JULIA

166
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,910
AND SAID, SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
TACT RETURNING PLAYERS, WHICH IS

167
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:35,414
AN ON-THE-SPOT QUESTION TO ASK,
LIKE WHAT CAN I POSSIBLY SAY?

168
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,449
YEAH, WE WANT YOU GUYS GONE.

169
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,251
THEYVE HAD THEIR MOMENT TO
SHINE.

170
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,052
ITS OUR TIME TO HAVE OUR
CHANCE.

171
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,088
AUBRY SAID SOMETHING INTERESTING
TO ME THE OTHER DAY.

172
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,091
SHE GRABBED MY ARM AND SHE SAID,
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

173
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,261
LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SAID THE
EXACT SAME THING TO ME.

174
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,631
SHE SAID THE EXACT SAME THING TO
HER, THE EXACT SAME THING TO

175
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,832
GAVIN.

176
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,234
I HEARD, I JUST WANT TO HAVE
AN OPEN DIALOGUE, THOSE KEY

177
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,302
WORDS.

178
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,538
I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK, YOU
REMIND ME OF MYSELF.

179
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,172
AUBRY IS GOING TO EVERYONE.

180
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,941
I THINK SHES A LITTLE PANICKED.

181
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,342
I HAVE YOU.

182
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,446
WE COULD START TO HAVE A
DIALOGUE.

183
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,614
I THINK SO.

184
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,517
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN HAVE A DIALOGUE,

185
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,785
BECAUSE I FEEL GREAT WITH YOU.

186
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,819
RIGHT.

187
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,688
SHES LIKE, I REALLY LIKE
YOU.

188
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,956
I THINK YOURE A GOOD PLAYER.

189
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,524
YOU REMIND ME OF PATRIOTS.

190
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,293
I THINK YOURE COOL.

191
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,895
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU REMIND
ME, THATS FUNNY.

192
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,797
YOU JUST REMIND ME OF ME A LOT.

193
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,666
I THINK YOU PLAY LIKE I DO.

194
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,067
WE SEE SIMILAR THINGS.

195
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,035
OKAY.

196
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,136
SAME WAVELENGTH.

197
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,972
SHES DOING HER BEST TO PULL
SOMEBODY IN WITH HER.

198
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,107
SHES DOING A GREAT JOB AT HER.

199
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,144
SHE MIGHT HAVE TO GO.

200
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,322
DID YOU CHECK THIS?

201
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,590
NO.

202
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,961
THERE WERE SO MANY LITTLE
CREVICES UP HERE.

203
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,829
GET A STICK.

204
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:01,167
IT USUALLY WONT BE LIKE THAT
FAR DOWN.

205
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,903
I ALMOST FEEL LIKE KELLEY THE
WE SHOULD ALL LOOK FOR AN IDOL

206
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,672
TOGETHER COULD BE COVER.

207
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,441
BECAUSE SHE ALREADY HAS IT?

208
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,408
LETS GO OVER HERE.

209
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,777
I REALLY LIKE KELLEY.

210
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,448
I FEEL GOOD WORKING ABOUT HER
WITH A BIG GROUP, BUT I DONT

211
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,617
HAVE ANYTHING WITH HER.

212
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,554
WE SHOULDNT SAY ANYTHING TO
WENDY THAT WERE CONCRETE DOING

213
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,455
IT.

214
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,592
BUT ITS POSSIBLE THAT IT IS
NOW, YOU KNOW?

215
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,628
WENDY FEELS LIKE HER BACK IS
AGAINST THE WALL BECAUSE SHE

216
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,663
LOST HER ONLY ALLY, WHICH WAS
REEM.

217
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,732
SHES WORRIED SHE COULD BE NEXT
TO GO.

218
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,602
SO WENDYS PITCH IS THAT WE
SHOULD GET RID OF WENTWORTH.

219
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,673
THE FUNNY THING IS I KNOW THAT
KELLEY WENTWORTH IS NOT GOING TO

220
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,575
LET ME GET TOO DEEP INTO THIS
GAME.

221
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,378
I KNOW SHE WANTS TO CUT ME SOON.

222
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,214
SHES A REALLY SMART PLAYER, AND
SHES GOING TO DO EVERYTHING SHE

223
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,282
CAN TO ELIMINATE THREATS.

224
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,653
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

225
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,354
I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF YOU GUYS
ARE WORKING WITH ME OR WITH

226
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,589
THEM?

227
00:10:56,622 --> 00:11:01,594
LISTEN, WE AGREE THAT
KELLEYS A HUGE THREAT.

228
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,498
IM JUST SAYING, LIKE IM A
NUMBER YOU CAN USE, AND WE HAVE

229
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,165
THE SAME END GAME.

230
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,668
WHAT WOULD OUR NUMBERS BE?

231
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:13,272
YOU, YOU, ME, KEITH AND WAR
DOG.

232
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,641
I WAS LOYAL TO REEM EVEN IF IT
AFFECTED MY GAME.

233
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,111
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT IN THIS
GAME, THIS IS NOT ON DEAF EARS.

234
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,814
ORCHESTRATING A BLIND SIDE IS
VERY DELICATE.

235
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:26,152
YOU HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL ABOUT
WHO YOU LET KNOW ABOUT IT.

236
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,588
I MEAN, KEITH SEEMS TO BE TIGHT
WITH WENDY, BUT TRYING THE PULL

237
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,558
IN WAR DOG, THAT MAKES ME VERY
NERVOUS, BECAUSE HE DOESNT LIKE

238
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,761
TO TALK TRACT UNTIL ITS
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

239
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,231
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WENDYS
LOYALTY AND TRUST COULD BE WORTH

240
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,633
MORE THAN MONEY IN THIS GAME.

241
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,737
SHE WOULDNT BE A BAD PERSON
 OH, NO.

242
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,805
SHES SO LOYAL.

243
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,973
I THINK THATS A GREAT THING TO
HAVE IN OUR POCKET.

244
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,942
I DONT WANT TO SHUT THIS DOWN
AT ALL.

245
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,045
BUT SERIOUSLY, DUDE, I TRUSTED
YOU IN THIS GAME MORE THAN I

246
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:53,579
TRUST ANYBODY ELSE.

247
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,613
IM WITH YOU.

248
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,116
LIKE I TALK MORE GAME WITH YOU
THAN ANYBODY BY FAR.

249
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:57,817
OKAY.

250
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,718
COOL.

251
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,419
I FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE
WITH YOU.

252
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:00,886
YEAH.

253
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,854
IM IN.

254
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,388
OKAY.

255
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,889
GOOD, MAN, GREAT.

256
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,124
LOVE IT.

257
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,694
MY STRATEGY COMING INTO THIS
GAME IS GET WITH BIG GUYS AND

258
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,398
KIND OF SLIP THROUGH, AND I
THINK DAVID MIGHT BE MY GUY.

259
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,833
WERE TWO PEAS IN A POD.

260
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,468
I THINK WE SEE THE WORLD THE
SAME WAY.

261
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,136
WE SEE THE GAME THE SAME WAY.

262
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,072
IM GOING TO USE MY SENSE OF
HUMOR AND TRY TO GET IN TIGHT

263
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,674
WITH HIM.

264
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,577
I WOULD BE FINE GOING ALL THE
WAY TO THE END WITH YOU.

265
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,347
I SHOULDNT EVEN BE TELLING YOU,
THIS BUT YOU COULD LIKE STRING

266
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,183
ME ALONG AND CUT MY THROAT AT
FOUR OR FIVE, WHATEVER.

267
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,487
IM JUST TELLING YOU --
 LETS SHAKE ON THAT ILL CUT

268
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,955
YOUR THROAT AT FOUR.

269
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,857
[LAUGHTER]
IS THAT COOL?

270
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,425
RICKS HYSTERICAL.

271
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,159
I LOVE THE GUY.

272
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,460
HES SO MUCH FUN TO BE AROUND.

273
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,296
RICK IS HONESTLY THE PERSON I
TRUST MOST IN THIS GAME.

274
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,032
ALSO HES VERY SMART AND
STRATEGIC, AND THAT COULD BE

275
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,300
REALLY GREAT FOR MY GAME.

276
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:59,378
SO IM GOING TO TRY TO KEEP RICK
AROUND FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

277
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,180
THERE IS AN IDOL HERE.

278
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,515
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

279
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:06,085
I THINK WE CAN BE MORE
AGGRESSIVE LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.

280
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,287
WE NEED THE FIND IT.

281
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,925
ADVANTAGES AND IDOLS ARE IN
EVERYONES MIND.

282
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,460
IM THE THE BIGGEST FAN HERE.

283
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,897
IVE BEEN WANTING TO DO THIS FOR
SO DANG LONG.

284
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,333
AS A FAN WATCHING THROUGH THE
TV, IM THINKING HOW IN THE HECK

285
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,635
DO THESE PEOPLE FIND THIS STUFF.

286
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,970
AND ITS THE SAME FOR ME NOW.

287
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,338
ITS JUST SHOOTING IN THE DARK.

288
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:33,212
YOU TRULY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
ITS AT.

289
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,714
GEOGRAPHICALLY THE SPACE IS
HUGE.

290
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:40,452
WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE IDOLS
ARE HIDDEN OR IF THERES CLUES

291
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,288
OR MARKINGS.

292
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:47,159
AND THE JUNGLE IS SO THICK THAT
YOU REALLY HAVE TO SEARCH FOR AN

293
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,761
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

294
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:57,736
AND TIME AWAY FROM THE TRIBE IS
SUSPICIOUS.

295
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,672
DO YOU EVEN THINK THERE ARE
IDOLS OUT HERE?

296
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,473
OF COURSE THERE ARE.

297
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,544
RECENTLY I SEE SOME MEN
DISAPPEARING, AND THEYRE GONE

298
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,546
FOR A LONG TIME.

299
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,716
WHETHER THEYRE GOING OFF ALONE
OR THEYRE GOING OFF IN PAIRS,

300
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,353
ITS QUITE OBVIOUS THERES A LOT
OF IDOL SEARCHING GOING ON.

301
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,922
IM SURE THEYRE LOOKING FOR
IDOLS.

302
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,123
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR
IDOLS.

303
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,559
WHY ARENT I LOOKING FOR IDOLS?

304
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,795
WHY DO THE MEN ALWAYS FIND THE
IDOLS?

305
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:23,495
OKAY.

306
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,830
WE NEED TO BE BABYSITTING MORE.

307
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,498
NO, WE NEED TO BE LOOKING.

308
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,334
I WISH I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON
WITH IDOLS AND ADVANTAGES.

309
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:32,905
IM SURE PEOPLE HAVE STARTED
LOOKING, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW

310
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,074
YOU WOULD EVEN BEGIN TO START
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

311
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,811
I MEAN, ITS A BIG PLACE, AND
EVERYTHING IS UNIQUE IN ITS OWN

312
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,412
WAY, BUT ALSO EXACTLY THE SAME.

313
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,481
THEYRE ALL TREES THAT LOOK A
LITTLE FUNKY.

314
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,916
WHERE DO YOU BEGIN.

315
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,218
THIS IS WHAT I WAS SAYING
WITH MEN VERSUS WOMEN.

316
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,887
WERE SITTING HERE CHITCHATTING.

317
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,622
WE COULD BE LOOKING FOR AN IDOL
RIGHT NOW.

318
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:55,194
ITS INTERESTING TO ME THAT
THE WOMEN AND MEN DO FALL INTO

319
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,662
THESE PRECONCEIVED ROLES.

320
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,231
I DONT KNOW IF ITS ABOUT
LIVING THIS PRIMITIVE LIFESTYLE

321
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:05,504
WHERE THE MEN WERE THE GATHERERS
AND HUNTERS -- NO, THE WOMEN

322
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,372
WERE THE GATHERERS.

323
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,539
I DONT KNOW.

324
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,042
I THINK ITS MY OWN PERSONAL
ISSUE THAT I HAVE TO START TO

325
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,643
FIGURE OUT.

326
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,144
IM NOT A SNEAKY PERSON.

327
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:16,048
AND IT FEELS SNEAKY TO ME TO
KIND OF SLITHER OFF SEARCHING

328
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:24,556
FOR IDOLS.

329
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,998
THERES A LOT OF PEOPLE
LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.

330
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,936
THE ODDS OF YOU FINDING IT ARE
SLIM, BUT EVER SINCE I WAS A

331
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:41,040
KID, FINDING AN IDOL WAS KIND OF
ON MY "SURVIVOR" BUCKET LIST,

332
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,576
BECAUSE MY TWO FAVORITE FEMALE
PLAYERS WERE PARVITY AND KELLEY

333
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:50,616
WENTWORTH.

334
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,218
THEY WERENT JUST GIRLS THAT
RODE COATTAILS.

335
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,921
THEY WERE BAD ASSES, ESPECIALLY
KELLEY WENTWORTH.

336
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,960
KELLEY FOUND TWO IMMUNITY IDOLS
IN HER SEASON.

337
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,728
AN SHE USED THEM BRILLIANTLY.

338
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,597
ALL RIGHT, BABY.

339
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,301
AND SO I ALWAYS WANTED TO
FIND AN IDOL.

340
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,269
AND THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

341
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,206
YOU CAN FIND AN IDOL ANYWHERE.

342
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:19,178
I SEE A TREE THATS KIND OF
FALLEN OVER.

343
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,548
AND IM THINKING, IF I WAS AN
IMMUNITY IDOL, I WOULD BE HIDING

344
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,819

00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,385
Jeff: CHRIS BACK IN.

00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,195
JOE HITS THE SIXTH ONE.

00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,697
KAMA IS STARTING TO CLOSE IN.

542
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,566
CHRIS HAS GOT TO PICK UP THE
PACE.

543
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,906
CHRIS SNAGS THE FOURTH RING,
KEEPING MANU IN IT.

544
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,108
JOE HOOKS THE SEVENTH RING.

545
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,143
KAMA HAS ONE LEFT.

547
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,181
CHRIS TRYING TO STAY IN IT.

548
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,716
JUST MISSES.

549
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,753
ERIC COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE FOR
KAMA.

550
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,889

551
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:28,960

[APPLAUSE]
ONCE AGAIN NOBODY GOING HOME

556
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:48,914
FROM YOUR TRIBE.

557
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,116
IN ADDITION, YOU HAVE A CHOICE
OF REWARD.

558
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,050
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

559
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,352
WELL, WERE GOING TO DO THE
FISHING GEAR.

560
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,422
FISHING GEAR WILL BE WAITING
FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.

561
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:01,826
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL BACK AT CAMP.

562
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,161
NICE WORK.

563
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,965
ALL RIGHT, MANU, FOR THE SECOND
TIME THIS SEASON, SOMEBODY FROM

564
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,066
YOUR TRIBE WILL BE VOTED OUT.

565
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,267
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

566
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:09,868
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

567
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,269
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

568
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,972
LOSING OUR SECOND CHALLENGE
DEFINITELY IS DEFLATING.

569
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,173
IT HURTS.

570
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,475
BUT NOW IM THINKING MAYBE THIS
IS NOT A BITHEIR EQUATION OF

571
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,145
JUST WENTWORTH OR WENDY EVEN
THOUGH THEYRE GOING TO WAR WITH

572
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:20,712
EACH OTHER.

573
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,648
MAYBE THERES PLAN "C."

574
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,617
KEITH IS A LIABILITY IN
CHALLENGES.

575
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,654
MAYBE A NEW GAME PLAN HAS TO BE
ENACTED.

576
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,772
WELL, WASNT FOR A LACK
OF TRYING.

577
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,741
GOOD JOB.

578
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,542
AMAZING.

579
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,776
YOU GOT FOUR LETTERS ON YOUR
OWN.

580
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,478
NOTHING YOU COULD HAVE DONE.

581
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,546
NOTHING YOU COULD HAVE DONE.

582
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,113
THATS ALL RIGHT.

583
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:55,914
SORRY.

584
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,717
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE
FOR.

585
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,352
THE CHALLENGE WAS A DISASTER.

586
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,853
MY SWIMMING WAS BAD.

587
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,522
CHRIS HAD TO HELP ME A LOT.

588
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,393
AND THEN THE RINGS TOSS, I JUST
LOOK HOME.

589
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,295
SO IT DID NOT GO AS LANDED.

590
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,031
BEFORE WE LOST 24 CHALLENGE, I
WAS SURE THAT WENDY WAS GOING

591
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,734
HOME, BUT NOW IM THINKING THAT,
YOU KNOW, MY NAME COULD BE ON

592
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:20,372
THE CHOPPING BLOCK, SO THIS
COULD BE MY LAST DAY HERE

593
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:20,939
PLAYING SURVIVOR.

594
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:25,043
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

595
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:30,115
AFTER THE CHALLENGE IM THINKING
KEITH IS THE ONE TO GO NOW.

596
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,016
HES A LIABILITY.

597
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,851
AT THIS POINT WERE DOWN TO
NUMBERS.

598
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,052
WE CANT LOSE AGAIN.

599
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:34,886
WE NEED STRENGTH.

600
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,788
AND KEITH IS NOT STRONG IN
CHALLENGES.

601
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,858
HES KILLING US.

602
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,459
SO ALL THESE THINGS ADD UP.

603
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,362
IM THINKING TO MYSELF, HOW IS
KEITH IN THIS GAME HELPING THE

604
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:44,929
WARDOG OUT.

605
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:45,830
THE ANSWER IS HES NOT.

606
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:50,468
I DONT THINK --
 THEYRE COMING UP.

607
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,203
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

608
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,506
WARDOG IS LEADING THE CHARGE TO
VOTE OUT KEITH.

609
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,340
ITS STUPID.

610
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,911
I DONT KNOW WHAT HES THINKING.

611
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:03,314
YEAH, HES FAILED MISERABLY, BUT
HES NOT A THREAT TO ANYBODY,

612
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,749
WHEREAS WINDY WANTS TO GET ME
OUT.

613
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,318
SO I AM NOT HAPPY.

614
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,953
I THINK ITS GOT TO BE KEITH.

615
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,222
HES A COMPLETE LIABILITY IN
CHALLENGES.

616
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,657
WENDY IS DIVING DOWN.

617
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,992
SHES A GOOD SWIMMER.

618
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,695
SHES AS TOUGH AS ANY OF THOSE
FEMALES.

619
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,595
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

620
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,030
OKAY.

621
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,967
I NEW CONVINCES WARDOG TO
VOTE OUT WENTWORTH WAS GOING TO

622
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:27,472
BE DIFFICULT, AND SURE ENOUGH,
WARDOG IS VERY ADAMANT THAT

623
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:31,142
KEITH IS GOING HOME, SO NOW I
DONT THINK THAT I HAVE THE FIVE

624
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,245
VOTES I NEED TO GET RID OF
WENTWORTH.

625
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,614
ITS LIKE, DAMN.

626
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,817
THE THEYRE UP THERE TALKING
ABOUT POSSIBLY GETTING KEITH

627
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,853
OUT, BECAUSE HE WAS A NO SHOW.

628
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,522
UNFORTUNATELY, KEITH KIND OF
SHOT HIMSELF IN THE FOOT, WHICH

629
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,957
KIND OF SUCKS.

630
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,292
BECAUSE HES A GOOD KID.

631
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,562
AND I KNOW THAT THIS GAME MEANS
A LOT TO HIM.

632
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,264
IM SO FREAKIN SORRY, YO.

633
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,700
YOU DID BEYOND FREAKING AMAZING.

634
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,569
I PROMISE YOU I TRIED THE
SWIMMING THING.

635
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,839
I DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

636
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,875
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I
PROMISE YOU, LIKE NO MATTER AT

637
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,544
WHAT POINT IN THE GAME WE ARE
NEW YORK IM NEVER TURNING MY

638
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:11,249
BACK ON YOU, BECAUSE YOU HAVE
HELPED ME WAY TOO MUCH.

639
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:15,286
LITERALLY NEVER, LIKE I PROMISE
YOU, LIKE EVER, LIKE AT NO POINT

640
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,421
IN THE GAME.

641
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:20,425
HONESTLY, I DONT WANT KEITH
TO GO, BECAUSE KEITH HAS

642
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,761
SPECIFICALLY TOLD ME, IM IN
WITH YOU UNTIL THE END.

643
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,163
IM GOING TO STAY LOYAL TO YOU
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.

644
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:32,604
THATS NOT THE TOP OF PLAYER YOU
VOTE OUT.

645
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:37,942
REAL QUICK, IS IT BETTER TO
KEEP KEITH AROUND?

646
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,410
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

647
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,745
WIN OR NOT WIN?

648
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,214
LETS SAY WE TAKE OUT KELLEY.

649
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:47,185
I THINK ITS SOMETHING
SERIOUS TO THINK ABOUT, BECAUSE

650
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,755
I DONT KNOW HOW MANY
OPPORTUNITIES IN AN UPCOMING

651
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,489
WITHIN WE WOULD HAVE.

652
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,423
EXACTLY.

653
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,492
WERE THINKING THE SAME
THING, MY FRIEND.

654
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:58,163
HOLY CRAP, WE MIGHT STILL BE
ABLE TO TAKE OUT WENTWORTH, AND

655
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:02,767
THE BEST PART OF THAT IS CHRIS
ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH THE IDEA.

656
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,868
CHRIS CAME TO ME.

657
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,604
WE BOTH THINK THIS IS THE PRIME
TIME FOR A BLIND SIDE.

658
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:13,011
THIS IS HUGE.

659
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,648
SO CHRIS CAME UP TO ME AT THE
WATER HOLE AND WAS ASKING ABOUT

660
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,184
IS KEITH THE RIGHT PERSON TO GET
OUT NEXT.

661
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,018
WHAT ABOUT KELLEY?

662
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,219
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

663
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,353
YEAH.

664
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,454
OH, MY GOD.

665
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,191
THIS IS GREAT.

666
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:26,658
YES!

667
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:27,692
THE ANSWER IS YES.

668
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:31,396
IF WE COULD GET HIM ON BOARD,
YOU AND I, WENDY.

669
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,931
WERE ON BOARD.

670
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,332
THATS FOUR.

671
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,400
WE ONLY NEED KEITH.

672
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,335
YES, BEST NEWS OF THE DAY.

673
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,503
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

674
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,105
I FEEL LIKE WEVE BEEN HANDED
THIS GIFT.

675
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,843
ITS CHRISTMAS, BECAUSE IM ALL
ABOUT BLIND SIDING WENTWORTH.

676
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,077
I THINK THATS A GREAT IDEA.

677
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,380
THIS TRIBE IS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR
TWO RETURNING PLAYERS.

678
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,383
SO I WANT TO TAKE HER OUT BEFORE
SHE COMES AFTER ME.

679
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,386
AND AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS ON
BOARD WITH THIS PLAN, ITS

680
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,821
ALMOST GOING TO HAPPEN ON ITS
OWN.

681
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,190
OKAY.

682
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:03,394
CHRIS HAS APPROACHED US ABOUT
GETTING RID OF KELLEY.

683
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,662
OH, MY GOD.

684
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,930
IM DOWN.

685
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,866
IM COMPLETELY DOWN.

686
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:08,299
COMPLETELY DOWN.

687
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,336
IM EXCITED.

688
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,403
ITS HARD IN MY POSITION.

689
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,806
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

690
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,808
THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS TO VOTE
OUT KELLEY.

691
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:22,513
I HAVE NEW LIFE.

692
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,514
OKAY.

693
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,116
WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH THIS.

694
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,217
YOU AND ME.

695
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,354
BUT THERES BEEN SOME
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT NOW WOULD BE A

696
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:35,293
REALLY GOOD TIME TO MAKE A MOVE
ON WENTWORTH BECAUSE WENTWORTH

697
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,563
IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS, SHES
ONLY GOING TO USE US UNTIL SHE

698
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,097
DOESNT NEED US ANYMORE.

699
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,864
CORRECT.

700
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,065
SHES GOOD ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT.

701
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,734
BUT HERES THE THING.

702
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:47,071
ITS LIKE A TRIBE SWAP, WERE
TALKING ABOUT A SCENARIO IN CHE

703
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,541
WE NEED A COUPLE BECAUSE WELL
BE DOWN ON NUMBERS, AND I THINK

704
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,777
WENTWORTH MIGHT BE A BIGGER
TARGET THAN YOU AND ME.

705
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,411
YEAH.

706
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,946
SHE MIGHT BE OUR SHIELD.

707
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,180
THATS OUR THING.

708
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:59,384
I DONT TRUST WENTWORTH ONE BIT,
BUT I FEEL LIKE WE ALL HAVE A

709
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,685
SIMILAR ALIGNED GOALS RIGHT NOW.

710
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,920
UH-HUH.

711
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,555
CHRIS IS THROWING COLD WATER
ON MY IDEA.

712
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,892
HE WANTS TO TAKE OUT WENTWORTH,
BUT I THINK THATS VERY

713
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,526
SHORT-SIGHTED.

714
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,260
SHES A RETURNING PLAYER.

715
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:09,994
SHES A THREAT.

716
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,195
SHE PLAYS THE GAME HARD.

717
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,064
SHE FINISHED FOURTH PLACE LAST
TIME.

718
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,599
SHES A GAMER.

719
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,869
BUT THAT MEANS SHE HAS A BIGGER
TARGET ON HER BACK THAN I DO.

720
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:22,073
THATS A GREAT REASON TO KEEP
HER AROUND.

721
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,877
BRING A GOAT TO THE END AND TAKE
THE SPOT AWAY FROM THEM?

722
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,045
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

723
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,915
I MEAN, I THINK IF WE COULD
TAKE OUT WENTWORTH FIRST, WE

724
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,583
TAKE OUT KEITH NEXT.

725
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,754
WELL, WE CAN CHANGE IT.

726
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,122
ITS NOT TOO LATE TO GO ANOTHER
DIRECTION.

727
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:42,160
I WANT THE PLAN TO BE MY PLAN,
BUT I WANT EVERYBODY ELSE TO

728
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,461
FEEL LIKE ITS THEIR PLAN, TOO.

729
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,097
I DONT WANT THEM LOOKING AT ME
LIKE IM TRYING TO CALL THE

730
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,864
SHOTS.

731
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,733
THAT WILL JUST GET ME INTO
TROUBLE.

732
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,469
SO CHRIS AND MYSELF, WE GOT TO
MAKE A DECISION, BUT IF WE ARE

733
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:57,342
GOING TO TAKE OUT WENTWORTH,
THIS IS THE VOTE.

734
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,477
IM TRUSTING MY LIFE WITH YOU
GUYS TONIGHT.

735
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:04,382
I KNOW.

736
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,585
PEOPLE ARE ACTING VERY
STRANGE.

737
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:12,323
ITS MAKING ME NERVOUS.

738
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,524
THERE HAS BEEN A SHIFT.

739
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,096
AND IM LIKE, IF I WERE IN THEIR
SHOE, WHAT WOULD I DO.

740
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,265
THERE IS NO QUESTION, I WOULD
VOTE ME OUT.

741
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,169
ITS NOT LIKE THESE PEOPLE KNOW
EACH OTHERS GAME, BURR THEY DO

742
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,304
KNOW MINE.

743
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,040
I DONT KNOW WHO IS TELLING
THE TRUTH AND WHO IS NOT.

744
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,709
IVE BEEN IN THIS POSITION
BEFORE, AND BOTH TIMES I WAS

745
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,311
BLIND SIDED.

746
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,915
I TRUST LAUREN, BUT NOT THESE
OTHER PEOPLE.

747
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,151
SO MY HEART IS BEATING VERY FAST
RIGHT NOW.

748
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,788
I FEEL LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE
DEEÉJAAÀ VU, AND IF THEY TAKE ME O

749
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,825
BEFORE KEITH, IM GOING TO BE SO
PISSED OFF.

750
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:28,066
SO LAST TRIBAL, SEEMS PRETTY
CLEAR REEM WAS THE PERSON YOU

751
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,735
WANTED OUT, BUT WENDY, YOU GOT
VOTES, AS WELL.

752
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:31,936
YES.

753
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,072
Jeff: ARE YOU CONCERNED YOU
MIGHT GET VOTES AGAIN THE UN?

754
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,508
YEAH, I FEEL LIKE THE FIRST
VOTE ESTABLISHES WHERE YOU ARE.

755
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,044
SO CONSIDERING I WASNT WITH
THEM FOR THE FIRST VOTE, MAYBE

756
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,412
ILL GET VOTES FOR THE SECOND
ONE.

757
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,682
Jeff: WENTWORTH, YOU ALSO
RECEIVED A VOTE.

758
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,852
IS IT UNNERVING TO GET A VOTE AT
THE FIRST TRIBAL?

759
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:51,022
YEAH DID I WANT TO SEE MY
NAME, NO, BECAUSE THAT MEANS

760
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,256
THAT YOUR NAME IS COMING UP.

761
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,293
JEFF, WE ALL KNEW WHO VOTED
FOR WENTWORTH, AND IT WAS REEM,

762
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,095
BUT HER NAME IS STILL OUT THERE
FOR SURE.

763
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,730
I MEAN, SHES --
 THANKS, KEVIN.

764
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,033
IM NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING
YOU DONT KNOW.

765
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,436
Jeff: WENTWORTH, KEVIN
PIPES IN, JUST SO YOU KNOW, YOUR

766
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,471
NAME IS STILL OUT THERE.

767
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,739
BUT AS A RETURNING PLAYER, IS
THAT TO BE EXPECTED.

768
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,508
YEAH, IVE PLAYED BEFORE.

769
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,678
PEOPLE CAN USE THAT AS AN ASSET
OR A NEGATIVE.

770
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,214
Jeff: WHAT IS THE ASSET OF
A RETURNING PLAYER?

771
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,750
I THINK ONE ASSET IS THAT IM
ALWAYS GOING TO BE A SHIELD.

772
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,820
IM ALWAYS GOING TO BE A BIGGER
TARGET THAN MOST OF THESE

773
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,822
PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY
GAME WHEN PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING

774
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,858
TO FIGURE OUT WHO TO GET RID OF.

775
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,361
I ALSO THINK THAT I AM A STRONG
TRIBE MEMBER AS FAR AS LIKE

776
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,629
WINNING, LIKE WE NEED TO WIN.

777
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,464
WE NEED NUMBERS RIGHT NOW.

778
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,166
Jeff: LAUREN, YOURE
NODDING.

779
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,934
THAT RINGS TRUE TO YOU?

780
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,971
OH, MY GOSH, WE CANT LOSE
AGAIN, EVER AGAIN.

781
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,440
IT SUCKS, ITS WORST FEELING IN
THE WORLD.

782
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,343
I THINK IF WE CAN HAVE A STRONG
TRIBE, THAT WOULD BE THE BEST

783
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,811
MOVE.

784
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:50,615
Jeff: KEITH, THE TALK SEEMS
TO BE CENTERING AROUND KEEPING

785
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,849
THE TRIBE STRONG.

786
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,719
DOES THAT CONCERN YOU IN BECAUSE
NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT,

787
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,654
YOUR CHALLENGE PERFORMANCE WAS A
DISASTER.

788
00:35:56,687 --> 00:36:00,158
THATS TRUE, BUT AT THE SAME
TIME, YOUR LONGEVITY IN THIS

789
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,627
GAME WILL NOT DEPEND ON RING
TOSS.

790
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,830
ONE CLEAR-CUT ROUT KEEPING THE
TRIBE STRONG, YOU COULD STILL BE

791
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:09,133
GOING TO THE MERGE WITH NUMBERS,
AND YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT FLIPS.

792
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:15,072
IT WILL DEPEND ON THE
RELATIONSHIPS YOU WILD.

793
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:19,343
Jeff: IS IT FAIR TO KEEP
THE TRIBE STRONG AND KEITH DID

794
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,346
NOT GET IT CON AND HE SHOULD GO
HOME, ITS EASY?

795
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,549
IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

796
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,718
YOURE BALANCING STAYING STRONG
AS A TRIBE, BUT ALSO STAYING

797
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:31,189
STRONG AS A VOTING UNIT, PEOPLE
YOU CAN TRUST.

798
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,959
THIS IS SUCH A CRUCIAL PART OF
THE GAME STRATEGICALLY.

799
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:38,696
AND TODAY IT WAS EVEN MORE
CRYSTAL CLEAR, LIKE, ALL RIGHT,

800
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,165
WE GOT TO FIGURE SOME THINGS
OUT.

801
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,702
Jeff: KEVIN, TWO BIG IDEAS
CHRIS JUST SHARED, DONT WANT TO

802
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,638
LOSE AGAIN, WHICH IS CHALLENGE
PERFORMANCE.

803
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,839
AND TRUST.

804
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,273
LOYALTY.

805
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,441
A GOOD POINT.

806
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:55,413
AND I THINK LAST TRIBAL LOYALTY,
PERFORMANCE, THEN YOU LOSE

807
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,848
AGAIN, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
PERFORMANCE IS LOOKING PRETTY

808
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,218
IMPORTANT.

809
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,652
MAYBE A LITTLE STRENGTH CAN GO A
LONG WAY.

810
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:06,224
IS WARDOG, IS THERE A LOT OF
TALKING AT CAMP?

811
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,325
ARE WE SELF-NOW?

812
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,560
IS THAT GAME ON, BLIND SIDES
WILL BE COMING?

813
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,163
I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF
TALKING GOING ON.

814
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,165
THERES A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS
FLOATING AROUND.

815
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,500
AND ITS POSSIBLE SOMEBODY DOES
GET BLIND SIDED TONIGHT.

816
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,303
Jeff: SO WHERE IS YOUR
GAUGE ON HOW WELL YOU THINK YOU

817
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,372
CAN READ THESE OTHER PEOPLE?

818
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,009
I WILL KNOW TONIGHT IF MY
GAUGE IS STRONG OR NOT.

819
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,912
THOSE VOTES GET READ, ILL KNOW
WHERE I STAND ON THIS TRIBE.

820
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,380
Jeff: DAVID, WHATS YOUR
TAKE?

821
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,917
DO YOU THINK TONIGHTS VOTE WILL
BE A BLIND SIDE?

822
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,153
I REALLY BELIEVE TONIGHT WILL
ABSOLUTELY BE A BLIND SIDE.

823
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,523
I FEEL LIKE I COULD WRITE DOWN
HOW EVERYONE IS GOING TO VOTE,

824
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:45,196
AND IF IT DOESNT GO THAT WAY, I
THINK THE BLIND SIDE WILL BE ON

825
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,397
ME.

826
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,832
Jeff: KEITH, DO YOU THINK
ITS GOING TO BE A BLOIND SIDE?

827
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,601
I THINK EVERYBODY HAS WORKED
THE GAME TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO

828
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,504
MAKE SURE THEYRE NOT THE ONES
GOING HOME, SO I THINK EVERYONE

829
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:57,241
THINKS THEYRE NOT GOING HOME,
SO, YES, I DO THINK THERE IS

830
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,409
GOING TO BE A BLIND SIDE.

831
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,178
Jeff: WENTWORTH, YOU CANT
PUT IT ANY BETTER THAN, THAT

832
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,481
EVERYBODY HAS TALKED TO
EVERYBODY AND IS CERTAIN THEYRE

833
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,550
RIGHT, WHICH MEANS IT CAN ONLY
BE ANOTHER BLIND SIDE.

834
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,119
YEAH, YOU HAVE THE
CONVERSATIONS YOU HAVE AND YOU

835
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,487
HOPE THE VOTE STICKS.

836
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,356
SOME PEOPLE HERE DIDNT WORK OUT
FOR THEM THIS TIME.

837
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,994
WHO DOESNT WANT TO CHECK
BLIND SIDE OFF THEIR LIST.

838
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:20,164
NOTCH THE TREE, DRINK FROM THE
WELL, BLIND SIDE.

839
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:30,007
I THINK YOURE FINE.

840
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,177
I GOT PAT ON THE SHOULDER.

841
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,414
Jeff: WARDOG, WHAT GAVIN
SAID IS JUST BEING HONEST.

842
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:44,221
I THINK EVERY MOVE YOU MAKE
SURE A RATIONAL DECISION.

843
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,824
WE WANT OUR CAKE AND WE WANT TO
EAT IT TO.

844
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,926
UNLESS IM DEALING WITH THE
SEVEN BEST LIARS IN THE WORLD,

845
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,263
WITH THE CHOICE TODAY, WE CAN
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

846
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:52,763
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

847
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,298
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

848
00:38:54,332 --> 00:39:00,204
DAVID, YOURE UP.

849
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:40,044
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

850
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,413
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

851
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:49,153
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

852
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,020
OKAY.

853
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,158
ILL READ THE VOTES.

854
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:59,730
FIRST VOTE, KELLEY.

855
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:03,768
KEITH.

856
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:04,935
WENDY.

857
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:11,575
THATS ONE VOTE WENTWORTH, ONE
VOTE KEITH, ONE VOTE WENDY.

858
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:12,443
KEITH.

859
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:16,480
THATS TWO VOTES KEITH.

860
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:16,847
KEITH.

861
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,015
FOR REAL?

862
