the rim of Mt. Yasur, a massive
crater that displays its anger

00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:19,085
on a regular basis, spewing
molten lava and rock thousands

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,689
of feet into the air.
Locals believe this is the final

5
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,024
resting spot for the spirits
of the dead.

6
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:29,162
Yasur is one of nine active
volcanoes on the island nation

7
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:33,466
of Vanuatu in the South Pacific.
It is a land with a fascinating

8
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,970
history of cannibalism, where
rituals like sorcery and black

9
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:41,441
magic are still a part of
daily life.

00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:45,678
It is here that 18 Americans are
about to begin the adventure of

11
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:50,150
a lifetime.
18 strangers, all from different

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,788
walks of life, forced to work
together to create a new society

13
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,957
while battling the elements and
each other.

14
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,727
They must learn to adapt, or
they'll be voted out of the

15
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,929

In the end, only one will remain

Welcome to<i> Survivor: Vanuatu--</i>
<i>Islands of Fire.</i>

25
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,216
The game is about to begin, but
before it does, you have to be

26
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:41,354
granted access to the land.
So you're going to take part in

27
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,191
a tribal ritual.
It is a rite of passage and an

28
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:49,295
invitation to stay on the land,
but in order to stay, you must

29
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,799
participate.
It's going to impact each of you

30
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,601
differently.
At times, you may find it

31
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,037
beautiful.
At times, you may be repulsed.

32
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,074
And at times, you may be
frightened.

33
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,243
Chief Mormor will preside over
all of this.

34
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,546
He is a real chief.
I will be there, but he will

35
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:10,249
guide you through it.
The tribes of Vanuatu take their

36
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:14,354
spirituality very seriously.
The ceremony you're going to

37
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,358
take part in is an authentic
Vanuatu tribal tradition.

38
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,061
You are in a foreign country.
Remember that.

39
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,164
This is their culture.
We are only visitors.

40
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,333
It's time to go over.
Three in a canoe.

Down the rope ladder.
>> Jeff gave us an overview,

42
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:39,112
saying how the customs
of Vanuatu are not like we're

43
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,048
used to, so I was... I was
really nervous after he was

44
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,383
talking to us.
I'm like, "What are they going

45
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,554
to do?"
>> Jeff informed us we're going

46
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,857
to climb down the side of the
boat and we're going to get in

47
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,759
these canoes.
I thought, 'Man, that's great,'

48
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,095
because I didn't learn how to
swim until six weeks before I

49
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,097
come here.
I would've been spooked if I

50
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:03,302
knew I had to swim.
(<i> screaming</i> )

51
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,306
>> We get into the boat, and it
tips over, so I'm trying to hold

52
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,143
onto the rope to keep me up.
It was killing my back, but I

53
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:17,417
wasn't about to move again.
I was going to stay right where

54
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,986
I was at.
We finally got another boat

55
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,155
over there.

57
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,671
us into the middle of the ring
where everybody circled around

58
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,740
us, it was really overwhelming
for me, and I don't know if it

59
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,444
was just the anticipation of
getting started or the whole

60
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,148
thing, but I was... really, I
was moved to tears.

tribesmen running with spears.
My first reaction was, you know,

64
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,214
"What's going on?"
We were like, "Wha-Wha-What?

65
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,849
Are we suppose to defend
ourselves?

66
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,150
What are we supposed to do?"
>> They're jabbing spears at

67
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,955
absolutely everybody except me.
Nobody jabbed a spear at me in

68
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,892
any way, shape or form, which I
took as, you know, a black man

69
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,895
coming on the island is not
particularly unwelcome.

70
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:49,942
(<i> singing</i> )
>> These guys in their big

71
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,278
cone-shaped jungle dresses--
they have these big sticks, and

72
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,914
they start, you know, pulling
people out with the sticks, but

73
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,250
kind of, like, you know,
whacking 'em out.

74
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,418
Soon enough, I noticed that they
were bringing the women to one

75
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:03,222
side.
We look over, and the guys, you

76
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,624
know...
Like, we're, like, kneeling on a

77
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,894
mat, and they all have, like,
little, like, stump seats

78
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,796
to sit on.
And they're, like, right in the

79
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,864
center of the action.
We're kind of off to the side.

80
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,600
And so I immediately start
thinking, 'What's with this?

81
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:18,037
I thought we were all supposed
to be part of this ceremony.'

82
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,543
>> They brought a bowl out,
and they uncovered the palm

83
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,479
leaves off of it, and they were
pointing at it.

84
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,648
Well, I thought maybe I was
supposed to wash my fingers or

85
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,750
something, you know?
Uh, we were getting ready to eat

86
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,718
something or-or, uh, wash my
fingers, 'cause it was some

87
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:40,459
rustic-looking stuff.
>> Chief Mormor offers each one

88
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,596
of us this kava, which is the
local drink.

89
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,666
It's like mud, basically.
You drink it.

90
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,836
Your lips go numb, and your
tongue goes numb, and your

91
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:54,507
throat goes numb.

93
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,517
and I look over at the girls,
and they're not getting anything

94
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,352
to drink.
And I'm thinking, 'Wow, this is

95
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,754
pretty cool.'
You know, special treatment for

96
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,425
the guys.

I was like, "Well, okay, well,

98
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,400
when do we get kava?"
But it never came around.

99
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,437
We're not getting the full
deal here.

100
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:28,641
I'm not used to being put second
behind a man.

what is about to happen next is

103
00:08:56,535 --> 00:09:01,140
a common part of their tribal
tradition.

104
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:12,285

people really honor pigs.

105
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:16,188
Pigs are, I think, sometimes
better than women.

106
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,525
Anyway, so, they come in with
this pig.

107
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,528
Right away, I thought, 'Okay,
we're having a pig roast,' you

108
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,630
know?
But I thought the pig was dead.

109
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,334
And then I realized the pig
was alive.

110
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,123
>> I eat meat, and I know that
animals are slaughtered, but,

111
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,292
like, seeing it was just like...
(<i> gasps</i> )

112
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,928
Like, I-I literally think I
gasped out loud, because it was

113
00:09:55,995 --> 00:10:01,734
just so shocking to watch.
>> That kind of stuff doesn't

114
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,569
bother me, because I'm a
shepherdess, and that's

115
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,772
what I do.
I-I raise lambs for that exact

116
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,476
purpose: to slaughter.
So I totally understand

117
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:16,015
that ritual.
>> The head chief took the

118
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,418
blood of his sacrifice and went
to each male member of

and said, "You are now a-a, you

120
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,425
know, a warrior in Vanuatu."
And basically, I felt what he

121
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,694
was doing was he was saying
"Welcome."

(<i> cheering</i> )
>> PROBST: There's one element

124
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:48,981
left to this initiation.
It involves a spiritual stone.

125
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,651
It is believed on these lands
that this carved stone and other

126
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,322
stones like it ward off evil
spirits.

127
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,358
Last thing you want in this game
is bad luck.

128
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,461
Possessing this stone could give
you a spiritual advantage

129
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,598
in the game.
As you've seen, men and women

130
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:09,268
are treated very differently.
The chief is offering the men a

131
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,672
chance to possess this stone.
The only hitch is you have to

132
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,409
get it from the top of that
pole, which has been greased

133
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:22,448
with pig fat.
If you fail, the women get it.

134
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,618
The chief will decide in which
order you go.

135
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,953
To show you that it can be done,
he's going to instruct a tribe

136
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,990
member to take it up and put it
there now.

137
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,329
>> Ever who possesses
that stone, the spirits are

138
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,166
supposed to be in favor.
Even though that's not my

139
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,768
beliefs, I still wanted that
stone, just so the girls

140
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:48,074
wouldn't get it.

falls flat on my face in front
of everybody."

143
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,922
The chief turned around, and he
pointed in my direction.

144
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,290
I was like, "Oh, my God.
No, not me."

145
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,325
And I went like this out of the
way.

146
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,995
I said, "Yeah, him?"

As soon as he did, I figured the

149
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:19,105
only way I'd even have any
chance is to do it kind of like

150
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,074

And I got a little dirt on my

going to do it.

00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,225
the chief into groups of men and
women, you will stay that way.

163
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,829
Men in possession of the
Spiritual Stone, you are the

164
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,599
Lopevi Tribe.
You will wear red.

165
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,801
>> Men against women.
It's perfect.

166
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,271
I can outsmart eight men a hell
of a lot quicker than I can

167
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,440
outsmart eight women.
Women stick together.

168
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,577
They're thick as thieves.
Men are deceiving, mischievous,

169
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,346
untrusting human beings.
Men-- I can manipulate.

170
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,417
>> PROBST: You are the Yasur
Tribe.

171
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,655
Named after the volcano.
You will wear yellow.

172
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,857
>> When I found out we was
splitting the men and the

173
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,626
women, I looked around at them
little girls and I thought, "Oh,

174
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,463
Lord, what did you get me into?"
We had a couple of ol' prissy

175
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,832
ones.
They probably hadn't even been

176
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,969
dirty in their entire days and
they ain't got a clue what's in

177
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,971
store for the next God knows how
many days.

178
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,907
>> PROBST: Your next task is to
find your tribal beaches.

179
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,109
You will not have a map to guide
you.

180
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,912
You will not have fire to lead
the way.

181
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:12,151
It is going to be a long, dark,
wet walk.

182
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,654
And when you get there, you will
have a pot, you will have a

183
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,924
machete and you will have a map
to water, and that's it.

184
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,961
Have a good 39 days.
Men, down the beach this way.

185
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,330
Keep walking till you find your
tribe flag.

186
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:28,133
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )
Ladies, down to the beach, head

187
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,836
right.
(<i> cheering</i> )

188
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,606
>> I think the boys got a lot
more out of that ceremony than

189
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,008
we did.
I think we definitely got a bum

190
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,144
deal.
So we're out for blood now.

191
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,015
(<i> cheering</i> )

192
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,762
>> Okay, girls. Be really
careful. >> You have to hold on

193
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,897
to the next person.
>> This is really slippery roots

194
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:02,334
here so be really careful.
>> Oh, whoa, Scout.

195
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,838
>> One down, one up.
>> Are you okay?

196
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,674
>> Yeah.
>> What do you think, Scout?

197
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:13,445
I'm going with your years of
experience and... and, uh, know-

198
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,016
how here, because I don't want
to... I don't want to walk

199
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,052
around all night.
>> I just wanted to hunker down

200
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,188
till daylight came so we could,
you know, find our camp easier

201
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,457
and everybody would be safe.
I wasn't tired.

202
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,460
I just love to sit and visit.
I haven't said anything to

203
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,630
anybody here, but I'm schlepping
around an artificial knee.

204
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,701
So I'm pretty cautious crawling
across lava rock that deep at

205
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,904
night with it raining.
(<i> hooting</i> )

206
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,407
>> Yeah?
>> Ami and Dolly and Scout

207
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,076
didn't want to come along.
They almost insisted on just

208
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,445
stopping where we were and, you
know, sleeping.

209
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,281
Like, I think sleeping right
here is, like, the stupidest

210
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,650
thing we could possibly do.
>> You guys, come on up here!

211
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,053
>> Come on.
>> We want to hang out.

212
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,121
We want to get to know each
other.

213
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,590
>> We want you to come
hang out with us.

214
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,093
>> Hey, girls, let's make
a group decision.

215
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,662
What way do you want to go?
>> I don't want to hold you.

216
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,497
I want you guys to go at your
pace, you know.

217
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,566
I just, I feel like they're
headed the wrong direction, so

218
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,502
I want you to go on.
I'm happy to stay back.

219
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,738
>> Somebody needs to make
a decision.

220
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,407
>> It got to a point
where we couldn't make a

221
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,776
decision whether we should
continue or go back or if we

222
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,379
missed the flag, or...
We were really kind of afraid

223
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,615
that we missed camp altogether
'cause it's dark out.

224
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,784
>> I really had my heart set
on find our camp tonight.

225
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,553
>> Me, too.
>> I didn't want to be too pushy

226
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,055
because I didn't want to be,
like, the odd person out.

227
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,624
>> Are you going to be able to
sleep in this rain and cold?

228
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,193
>> No, no, I want to keep
walking.

229
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,061
>> We might as well keep
walking.

230
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,597
>> Luckily, you know,
other people agreed with me

231
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,567
that, um, we should continue.
Scout, will you come with us

232
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,069
if we chose to go, or are you
going to...?

233
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,605
>> Yeah, I'll go with you.
>> Come on, girl.

234
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,108
>> Yeah, let's go forward.
>> We don't want the guys

235
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,909
to find their camp before us.
(<i> scattered laughing</i> )

236
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:59,151
>> I know, I know.
>> Whoo!

237
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,487
>> It's the blind leading
the blind here.

238
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:05,157
>> Where's the flag, bro?
>> I don't think nine of

239
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,693
us would miss it.
>> Can we hold on a quick

240
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,263
second?
We really need to come up with

241
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,733
some sort of game plan because
this walking our path is bull...

242
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,936
I mean, we got nine of us.
There's got to be a better way

243
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,539
than this.
Now we can keep walking along

244
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,575
the path, and some of us can
walk along the path, but then

245
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,678
we passed several trails that
are going up, and we have no

246
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,046
idea where those things are
going.

247
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,382
Nine of us walking in a group
like a bunch of ladies ain't

248
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,950
helping.
>> Rory, I don't think

249
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,886
he's going to fit in.
There is one in every bunch, you

250
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,021
know what I mean?
To see, like, Rory already

251
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,890
barking out orders, what is he
thinking?

252
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,459
I'll be honest with you, the
walk is, like, kind of keeping

253
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,895
us busy, like, we got something
to do, just walk.

254
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,297
Like, you know what I mean?
Once we find camp anyway, what

255
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,965
are we going to do when we get
there anyway?

256
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,367
>> What does the group want
to do?

257
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,103
What do we want to do?
>> Keep walking?

258
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,472
>> Move on.
>> Move out, move out.

259
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,741
>> I don't think there was
any independent thought.

260
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,310
I think that we could've covered
more ground if we weren't all

261
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,712
walking in a big pack of nine
guys all at once.

262
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,550
Some of the younger guys that...
that are here, none of them want

263
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,984
to listen.
They're all young.

264
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,587
>> Little tension on
the first night.

265
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:13,392
(<i> scattered chuckling</i> )
>> What's that right there?

266
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:18,263
Does that look like a stick with
a flag on it?

267
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,567
Yo, it's the flag!
(<i> whooping</i> )

268
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:27,072
We got the flag!
>> Yeah!

269
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:38,550
(<i> talking excitedly</i> )
>> Let's be real careful.

270
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,787
>> This has got to be it.
>> Please be our beach,

271
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,457
please be our beach, please be
our beach.

272
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:49,194
>> Yeah!
(<i> whooping and cheering</i> )

273
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,698
You guys, we did it!
(<i> cheering</i> )

274
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,934
We see the flag and, you know,
all the trouble, all the

275
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,537
conflicts, like, dissolved.
We're all hugging and thrilled

276
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,639
to death that we're here.
>> Here's to be persevering

277
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,909
and being strong!
(<i> cheering loudly</i> )

278
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,546
(<i> whooping</i> )
>> Okay, now what?

279
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:21,093
(<i> scattered laughing</i> )
>> Should we bring the rest

280
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,829
of the fronds over?
>> I think now let's pull in

281
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,931
what we got and see and then
tie 'em down.

282
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,367
You got to tie all these up to
that center piece.

283
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,603
Boy, we've got a really sturdy
rack for a shelter.

284
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,772
It's been a group effort.
I've stayed with it, and Twila

285
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,543
has stayed with it, and, uh,
Leann stayed with it.

286
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,546
But some of the gals are down
there on the beach basking in

287
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:45,851
the sun, chitchatting.
>> Oh, praise the spirit

288
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,687
for the sun.
>> Rub it on.

289
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,124
>> It's scrub, deodorant.
Shampoo.

290
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,793
>> I call all these
sorority girls "bowheads."

291
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,195
That's what we call them back in
Oklahoma.

292
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,364
They all like to hang together.
They're like cattle.

293
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,800
I mean, really, cows, they just
cluster.

294
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,436
And those sorority chicks, they
aren't paying attention to any

295
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,371
damn thing but themselves.
You know, they're their favorite

296
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,142
topic.
>> I'm really not a

297
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,977
negative person.
Like, I'm awfully optimistic

298
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,746
in most cases, but for some
reason, I just don't think we're

299
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,783
going to get fire from rubbing
two, like, quasi dry sticks

300
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,320
together.
>> Eliza, she talks nonstop.

301
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,090
She's probably at the top of my
list, just to get her mouth out

302
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,792
of my face.
I'm telling you.

303
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,161
>> Dude, are they building
shelter right now?

304
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:31,663
I don't see them.
>> Just lean up against

305
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,300
this and hold that.
Slide down a little bit, though.

306
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,604
(<i> chuckles</i> )
>> Twila has been working

307
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,773
on the shelter constantly.
I feel like her continuous work

308
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,777
has made those of us who have
taken reasonable breaks look bad

309
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,914
in her mind to think that, oh,
they're not pulling their

310
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,515
weight.
Hey, ladies, looking great.

311
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,318
>> We had too much chattering
and not enough moving.

312
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,154
Mouths are working but the hands
ain't.

313
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,457
The hut still is not done.
There is a couple of them that

314
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,692
didn't do nothing but bitch,
moan and complain last night.

315
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,761
We was all cold.
You know, get off your ass, get

316
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,130
the... done or don't bitch about
it tonight when you're freezing

317
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:17,409
your butt off.
>> We know where our

318
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,544
water source is.
It's just a little creek with

319
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,446
some fresh water.
It looks really clean, but it's

320
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,083
still going to have to be
boiled, and... I guess our

321
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,820
problem right now is we just got
to get a fire going.

322
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,922
>> Hey, you guys, before we
start the fire, let's

323
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,725
get the, uh, let's get the
Immunity Rock, huh?

324
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,495
Rub the rock's head.
>> Fire.

325
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,498
>> Well, you know, it worked
at home when I did this.

326
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,467
You make a little notch in this
fire tray and put the ball of

327
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,836
tinder right in here.
On the opposite side, you make a

328
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:49,574
groove.
The Aborigines did this, why

329
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,777
can't we?
>> J.P. wants to prove himself

330
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,079
bad.
He's about 30 years old, and

331
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,749
he's feeling like, you know, I'm
buff, I'm bad, I'm young, I'm

332
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,785
all, you know, go to the end of
this.

333
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,287
He don't have a clue.
He's got the frame, but he ain't

334
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,856
got the brain.
>> Slackening.

335
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:08,126
>> Yup, there you go, dude.
Keep it going.

336
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,128
>> Yup.
>> This is going to be it.

337
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,064
Keep going.
>> Ton of smoke, ton of smoke.

338
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,799
>> We need more smoke,
more smoke, dude.

339
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:14,933
(<i> grunting</i> )
>> Dump it...

340
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,435
Blow it...
>> It's here...

341
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,437
It's right here, it's right
here, it's right here.

342
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,874
>> We actually had a hot
ember, which was very pink.

343
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,077
>> Oh, you're getting it.
>> Yeah, that's it.

344
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,079
>> Just go, go, go.
>> Easy, easy...

345
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,415
>> I think we were all excited
to see a hot ember, but none of

346
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,051
us knew what to do with it.
We were just kind of like,

347
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,152
"Yeah, we've got ember."
No.

348
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,421
>> No!
>> We were so close to

349
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,324
getting fire going that I
thought we were gonna be

350
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:44,463
able to boil water.
Didn't work.

351
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,131
>> You got those leaves?
>> You guys check it out.

352
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,599
I got to...
I got to show you this.

353
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,135
>> There's one more right now.
>> You guys agree that I

354
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,205
had a pretty good run down here,
I didn't fall or anything?

355
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,290
>> After doing things that
are physically demanding, I felt

356
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,659
like it was the right time to-to
reveal the fact that I have no

357
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:19,431
foot, that it's a prosthesis.
They were pretty surprised.

358
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,833
It's a rare form of cancer
called synovial sarcoma.

359
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,936
And I just had a little, uh,
bump in the bottom of my foot...

360
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,105
>> Dude.
>> ...and thought it was

361
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,707
nothing.
I thought it was a cyst.

362
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,843
I lost it about 20 months ago.
>> Dude, it's inspirational

363
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,078
that you're here.
It's awesome.

364
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,379
>> Yeah.
>> I know.

365
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,182
>> Good on you, mate.
>> I had absolutely no

366
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,551
idea that Chad had no leg.
I mean, he had...

367
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,187
He was wearing pants the whole
day, so he just goes, "Hey,

368
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,189
guys, look."
And then he unzippered his

369
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,191
pants, and there was no leg.
It was pretty...

370
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,293
It was pretty shocking.
>> It's, uh...

371
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,896
>> Extremely mobile, man.
You did a hell of a job with it.

372
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,298
>> Well, I try.
>> Great.

373
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,067
The guy with the mechanical
leg's gonna win for sure.

374
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,437
He's nice, he's smart, he's
quiet, and he... you know, he's

375
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,840
got the underdog thing going on,
so we're screwed.

376
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,909
>> That's awesome, dude.
I had no idea.

377
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,377
>> I'm amazed.
All the power to him.

378
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,913
I totally think that's
inspirational, but if I have

379
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,215
to vote his ass out of here
tomorrow, I'm still gonna vote

380
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,650
his ass out of here tomorrow.

381
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:24,896
>> Let's go.

382
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,431
>> Tree mail.
>> Whoo!

383
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,935
>> Tree mail.
>> How cool.

384
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,937
>> I know.
>> Is this it?

385
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,207
>> "A show of pride and unity,
each time the two tribes meet.

386
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:39,144
Bring your tribal flag with you
whenever you complete."

387
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,645
>> Compete.
>> Compete.

388
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,514
"Access..."
>> "Assess your tribe mates

389
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,549
strengths.
Whose talents you'll require."

390
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,484
>> Mm-hmm.
>> "One tribe leaves with heads

391
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,787
hung low, the others go home
with fire."

392
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,622
(<i> gasping and cheering</i> )
>> They don't have it.

393
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,858
They don't have it.
>> We got tree mail, and,

394
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,927
um, we're all psyched up, 'cause
supposedly we're gonna get some

395
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,364
fire.
>> Obviously, most people

396
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,267
think that girls are weaker, and
women aren't cut out for this

397
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,836
kind of thing, so I think it's
really important that we win

398
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,905
this challenge.
We're gonna go and kick some

399
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:16,948
butt.
>> PROBST: Yasur, the ladies,

400
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:27,425
butt.
>> PROBST: Yasur, the ladies,

401
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,960
how is it going so far?
Two nights.

402
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,896
>> Two long, cold...
>> No fire.

403
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,230
>> ...wet nights.
>> No fire.

404
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,966
>> But it's going awesome.
>> PROBST: All right, Lopevi,

405
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,968
you guys, grinning.
No problem, right?

406
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,271
First three days, how is it
going so far?

407
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:42,107
>> We still need fire before
we're gonna drink water.

408
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,143
So we need to boil ours.
We're not taking any chances.

409
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,078
>> PROBST: Okay.
Let's get to the first

410
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:50,048
challenge.
It is for both reward and

411
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,817
immunity.
There are several elements.

412
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,221
All nine of you must go under
the mud crawl.

413
00:25:56,288 --> 00:26:00,058
Once all nine of you have made
it to the other size of the mud

414
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,228
crawl, three tribe members will
tackle the box maze.

415
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,363
Your goal is to maneuver a ball
from the start to the finish

416
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,399
net.
Once the ball gets in the net,

417
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,168
take it with you, because it has
matches inside that you're gonna

418
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,071
need later.
The next stage, all nine must

419
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,373
cross a very narrow balance
beam.

420
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,744
If you fall off, or if your feet
hit the net at any time, you got

421
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,580
to go back to the start.
Once all nine have finished,

422
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,784
three different tribe members
will race to build a fire that

423
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,886
will burn a rope and drop a
torch.

424
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,222
Light it, cross the finish line.
First tribe with a lit torch to

425
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,059
cross the finish line and light
the final wok wins reward and

426
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,263
immunity.
Want to know what the reward is?

427
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,931
>> Absolutely.
>> Absolutely.

428
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,399
>> It's flint.
(<i> applause</i> )

429
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,134
>> Yeah!
>> You already have steel

430
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,770
with the machete.
This will give you fire, give

431
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,807
you warmth, let you boil water.
But more important than reward

432
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:53,311
is this.
Immunity.

433
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,480
>> All right.
>> PROBST: This is what you want

434
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,584
in this game.
If you have immunity, you are

435
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,219
safe.
You cannot be voted out.

436
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,355
Without it, you are vulnerable.
Ready to go?

437
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,023
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Take your spots on

438
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,259
the start and wait for my go.
All right.

439
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,863
Here we go for reward and
immunity.

440
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,367
Survivors ready?
Go!

441
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,869
Through the mud pit.
Everybody dead even.

442
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,206
>> Come on.
>> Come on...

443
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,909
>> Come on...
Come on.

444
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:30,949
>> PROBST: Pretty even.
Keep moving.

445
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,951
Get your face down and dig
through.

446
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,786
John and Lisa are across.
>> Come on, go.

447
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,889
Come on...
>> PROBST: A lot of teamwork

448
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,091
going on.
The women pulling each other

449
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,594
through.
Guys pulling each other through.

450
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,698
(<i> people shouting</i> )
Dead even.

451
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,366
Let's go.
Get her through.

452
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,135
Get her through.
Pull him!

453
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,938
Got to get on the mat.
Men are through the mud.

454
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,977
Men moving on to the box maze.
Get on the mat.

455
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,180
Drag her.
Women through the mud.

456
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,049
Women moving on to the box maze.
>> Careful.

457
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,985
Does it need to go over there?
>> It goes here, it

458
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,887
goes here...
>> PROBST: You need the maneuver

459
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,256
the ball into the finish net.
>> Don't let it go in yet.

460
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,724
>> Ready?
Now. Now.

461
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,726
>> We're in.
>> No. Just take your time.

462
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,395
Easy. Right there.
>> PROBST: Guys hit a roadblock.

463
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,931
>> That needs to go through
this one.

464
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,599
>> No, down.
>> Down...

465
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,734
>> Here.
>> Nice.

466
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,370
(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )
>> It won't fit.

467
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,006
>> PROBST: Girls working
together well.

468
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,410
>> Oh, oh.
>> Oh, come on.

469
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,946
>> PROBST: The men have it.
Moving on with their ball to the

470
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,748
balance beam.
>> Nice.

471
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,883
Now, tilt, tilt.
Don't let it go down now.

472
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:44,222
>> PROBST: Chad first up on the
balance beam.

473
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,758
Keep working.
You're still in this.

474
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,860
>> Now, we can't let it go
through that last one.

475
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,895
>> Okay, okay, bring it back.
I'll bring it back.

476
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,764
>> Don't tilt it.
Just go nice and tiny.

477
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,233
>> PROBST: Bubba is down.
Back to the start.

478
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:04,142
>> Go, go, go, go...
>> PROBST: John makes it across.

479
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,344
The women have it.
Ladies, you're still in it.

480
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,347
>> Go, go, go.
>> Come on.

481
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,817
>> Go, go, go, go, go...
>> PROBST: Brady, you're across

482
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:13,985
and down.
>> Go.

483
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,753
>> Come on, women.
Agility, agility.

484
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,357
>> PROBST: Bubba gonna crawl.
Oh, scraping his belly against

485
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,659
that wood.
That cannot feel good.

486
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,828
>> You got it, man.
Come on.

487
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:28,366
>> Think fire, think fire.
>> Come on, think about it.

488
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,568
>> PROBST: Bubba working it.
>> Let's go, let's go.

489
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,270
She's catching you, she's
passing you.

490
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,906
>> PROBST: You cannot touch any
part of the net.

491
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,208
>> She's passing you.
>> PROBST: Leann makes it.

492
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,511
Women have their first woman
across.

493
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,113
Get those feet up there.
>> Good man.

494
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,782
>> PROBST: Bubba's through.
>> Yeah.

495
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,118
>> Let's go, come on...
>> Go.

496
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,522
>> PROBST: Chad you're there.
Keep moving Twila.

497
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,690
Watch your feet.
Keep 'em up.

498
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,792
That a way.
Drag those feet up.

499
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,895
You're good.
>> Hurry, hurry!

500
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,930
>> PROBST: Lea makes it.
You're down.

501
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,066
Dolly, you're good.
That a way to dig, Rory.

502
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,370
(<i> people shouting</i> )
Mia makes it across.

503
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:09,874
Women are closing the gap.
That a the way, Rory.

504
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,211
Down to you two.
Down to Scout and Chris.

505
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:23,288
(<i> all shouting</i> )
>> PROBST: No, Chris to

506
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,790
the back.
Hustle, man, you got it.

507
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:30,295
Stay in this!
(<i> all shouting</i> )

508
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,101
>> PROBST: Women have taken the
lead.

509
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,270
Hustle, Scout.
You got to get to the mat.

510
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:46,110
(<i> all shouting</i> )
>> Keep going, keep going.

511
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,946
>> PROBST: Let's go, men.
You're still in it.

512
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,014
Women have to make fire.
>> Start it small.

513
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,083
Start it small then roll around
it.

514
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,785
>> Then we'll grab it.
>> Move forward.

515
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,420
Move forward, buddy.
>> Don't do it...

516
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,922
>> Just like you're walking
on the sidewalk, bro.

517
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,791
>> It's all you, man.
>> He's off again.

518
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,593
He's off again.
>> It's all you, man.

519
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,028
>> Plenty of time, dude.
Take your time.

520
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,631
Focus.
>> Get a few tall sticks

521
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,933
on there.
>> Come on, man, it's all you.

522
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,103
>> Keep your feet straight.
>> Jimmy.

523
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,974
>> Come on, girls.
(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )

524
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,276
>> PROBST: Ladies have fire.
>> Whoo!

525
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,979
>> PROBST: Protect that fire.
Block the wind.

526
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,815
>> You can do this, Chris!
You can do it, man.

527
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:26,150
Say to yourself, you can do it,
buddy.

528
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,721
>> Just think how warm we'll be
tonight, please.

529
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:33,591
>> Okay, let's go now.
>> They got as far as... now.

530
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,660
>> Whoo!
>> Look up.

531
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,829
Let's go.
>> It's all you.

532
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:39,964
It's all you, man.
You're the man.

533
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,834
You got our support.
>> Here we go, here we go.

534
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,969
Here we go.
Keep it going.

535
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,639
Keep it going.
>> Go faster, go faster, go

536
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,241
faster, go faster...
>> Go, go, go, go...

537
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:55,246
>> Oh!
>> PROBST: Here it goes.

538
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,614
(<i> all shouting</i> )
>> Fire!

539
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,518
>> Oh, fire!
>> There it is.

540
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,756
There it goes!
(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )

541
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,593
>> Go!
(<i> cheering</i> )

542
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,029
>> PROBST: Yasur across the
finish line.

543
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,632
The women win the first
challenge-- reward and immunity!

544
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:19,737
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> WOMEN (<i> chanting</i> ): Fire and

545
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,775
water and immunity, fire and
water and immunity...!

546
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:28,780
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> PROBST: Yasur, right here.

547
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,116
(<i> cheering</i> )
That's going back to camp.

548
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,720
No Tribal Council for you guys.
>> Yeah!

549
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,722
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: And flint.

550
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,757
Water tonight.
You'll stay warm.

551
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,293
Congratulations.
>> ALL: Thank you.

552
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,762
>> Thank you.
>> In the mood for a hot meal?

553
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,632
>> PROBST: Lopevi, tough break.
Chris, certainly gave it

554
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,268
everything you had.
We'll see if it mattered or not

555
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,904
tonight at Tribal Council.
Somebody is going home.

556
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,773
First person voted out.
I'll see you there.

557
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,044
>> Whoo!
(<i> cheering</i> )

558
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,959
>> Hey, bottom line, I think we
underestimated them, man.

559
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,561
They did a good job.
>> Oh, yeah, yeah.

560
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:21,132
Yeah, we just lost.
>> Losing fire right now

561
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:25,737
was tough.
Losing to women was tough.

562
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,805
>> I want to tell you guys a
little bit more about myself.

563
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,742
I'm not real good at balance.
(<i> laughter</i> )

564
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,977
>> Chris couldn't get
across the balance beam.

565
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:36,681
The fact is, he didn't make it,
and we lost.

566
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,750
>> I'd get halfway and hit
a wall.

567
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,752
I really wanted to make it
across the beam.

568
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,920
You know, if I had wings, I'd
have made it.

569
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,356
You know, I would have made
myself go across the beam.

570
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:49,327
This game, you outwit,
outplay, outlast people.

571
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:59,370
You don't out-balance them.
>> It has to be.

572
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:05,309
You don't out-balance them.
>> It has to be.

573
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,678
You know what I'm saying?
>> I totally agree.

574
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:13,618
>> We have to win this game.
>> Lea, what do you think... who

575
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,686
are you leaning towards tonight?
We're just talking, as a group,

576
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,990
we want to be a strong group.
>> Bottom line is, I

577
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,459
want to beat those girls, and I
want to keep getting immunity.

578
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,529
The way I'm going to do it is,
it's basically the weakest link.

579
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,497
>> I'm going to give it a
few hours and see what the

580
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,233
attitudes are, 'cause, I mean, I
like everybody.

581
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,637
>> That's the thing.
>> I don't have no bad

582
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:36,374
quarrels with nobody.
J.P., Brady, John and Brook--

583
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,944
they basically said, "Sarge,
we need to get rid of the

584
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,947
weakest link."
It's tricky to decide who I'm

585
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,482
going to vote for.
I said I'm going to think

586
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,717
about it.
They said the weakest link.

587
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:51,322
They're assuming that I agree
that the weakest link is Chris.

588
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,059
If we're going to stay in this--
the old people-- the only way

589
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,929
we're going get a million
dollars, one of us, is if we get

590
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:07,205
rid of the young people.
>> But J.P. is the only one that

591
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,074
really is trying to make fire.
I'd say Brook.

592
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,944
Brook is cocky, and we don't
know where he lies.

593
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,180
>> I'll talk to Chad.
I prepared to come here

594
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,416
mentally, and I prepared to
play the game.

595
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,852
I'm not vulnerable at all.
We got a plan.

596
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,123
>> I'm just trying to survive
the first couple days.

597
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,193
>> The one thing you got to
worry about is you never know.

598
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,262
Those guys could smarten up,
which I hope they didn't.

599
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,698
Personally, I think these are
all young guys on the team, guys

600
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,800
are going to be targets.
I feel like I am one of the

601
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,269
stronger, younger guys who's
going to be a target.

602
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,404
>> Right now, we're in
charge of...

603
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,406
As of right now, you know
what I mean?

604
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,408
>> Not necessarily.
>> Trust me.

605
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,711
>> Cool.
>> You know what I'm saying?

606
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,779
>> All right, cool.
I'm down.

607
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:56,821
>> All right.
>> Well, obviously I haven't

608
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,891
fully made up my mind on who I'm
going to vote for yet tonight.

609
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:03,494
I'm thinking about Chris right
now, but Rory, he's kind of on

610
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,897
his own sheet of music a lot of
the time.

611
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:09,100
I think maybe some people feel
like Rory is maybe not putting

612
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:13,070
out as much group effort as some
of the other guys, and the group

613
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:23,114
right now is where it's all at.
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

614
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:33,157
right now is where it's all at.
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

615
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:40,565
right now is where it's all at.
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

616
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,600
guys is a torch.
Go ahead and grab a touch,

617
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,270
approach a flame and get fire.
Because in this game, fire

618
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,807
represents your life.
As long as your torch has fire,

619
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,609
you're still in the game.
When your flame is gone,

620
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:57,882
so are you.
Welcome to your first Tribal

621
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,319
Council-- definitely not the
place you want to be.

622
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,322
Somebody is going to go home as
a result of today's loss.

623
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,991
But before we get to the vote,
let's talk about today's

624
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,727
challenge.
Anybody here willing to admit

625
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,831
that as they saw Chris fail,
fail, fail, that they started

626
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,733
thinking, "This guy is killing
us."

627
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,670
>> Oh, I mean, yeah.
Because it was so easy.

628
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,908
And I'm saying, "Come on, bring
your big tail across the doggone

629
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,110
beam.
We were ahead; now we're losing.

630
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:29,013
All we got to do is build a
little fire, blow the torch and

631
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,050
win over these females."
>> PROBST: Chris, at any point

632
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,686
while you're trying to cross it,
are you also thinking, "I'm

633
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,055
dead, I'm going home tonight"?
>> No, I wasn't.

634
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,625
I wasn't thinking "I'm going
home tonight."

635
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,793
I wasn't thinking "I'm dead."
I don't categorize stuff

636
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,062
like that.
The first night, Rory, he had

637
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,365
some ideas.
He was getting on people's

638
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,200
nerves.
Did I all of a sudden develop an

639
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,802
opinion about him and think,
"You know what?

640
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,038
He's going home the first time I
go to Tribal Council."

641
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,907
No, I didn't think that.
Everybody's going to help the

642
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,910
team some way, sometime down
along the line, and that's all I

643
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,079
think about.
>> PROBST: Rory, how are you

644
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:05,016
fitting in with this group?
>> I fit in fabulously well,

645
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,252
and I love my partners here.
We've accepted every single

646
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,722
thing that's come our way as a
family and as a team, and I

647
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,759
would expect that's the way
we're going to continue to

648
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,428
operate.
>> PROBST: J.P., how close are

649
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,831
you to crisis mode in terms of
not having water?

650
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:24,235
>> We're on red alert.
I mean, when you get into this

651
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:27,672
game, you realize, you take a
lot of things for granted, and

652
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,541
water is one of them.
You start getting headaches.

653
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,677
You can't get up.
You're lethargic.

654
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,279
You start cramping.
It's taken a toll on all of us

655
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,748
in some way or another.
>> PROBST: Before we get to the

656
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,584
vote, there's one other topic we
have to bring up.

657
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,720
You got your first look today at
the women.

658
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,423
>> Mmm.
>> PROBST: Bubba, that was just

659
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,791
a little grunt or a groan,
or a...?

660
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:50,061
>> Jeff, I've said it once,
I've said it a thousand times.

661
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:53,030
You never underestimate a woman.
I knew going into this that

662
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:56,133
these women were going to be
fighting hard, and I hope now

663
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,203
everybody respects these ladies,
'cause they mean business, and

664
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,872
they can kick our tail, Jeff.
>> PROBST: Brook, anybody you

665
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,375
wouldn't mind ending up on a
tribe with?

666
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,877
>> Yeah, there was a couple
girls that had really nice, um,

667
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,880
tails, but, uh, I was real
impressed with how competitive

668
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,349
some of those girls were.
It's one thing to expect it, and

669
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,852
one thing to see those girls
shimmying across that beam and

670
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,354
grinding their teeth and
screaming and yelling just

671
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,090
'cause they want to beat us
so bad.

672
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,493
But, yeah, I was peeking over
quite often when I got a chance.

673
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,029
>> PROBST: J.P., you had to be a
little surprised nine women

674
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,832
kicked your guys' butt.
>> I think as the group,

675
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,501
we expected to win.
Nine males, Jeff-- there's nine

676
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,937
of us.
We're all brute strong.

677
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,439
We're going to have to come in
and play the game a little bit

678
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,874
harder.
They just raised the level of

679
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,110
the game.
>> PROBST: With that, it is time

680
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,445
to vote.
Brook, you're up first.

681
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:54,258
>> Chris, I'm making this
vote to save my own butt, and

682
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,660
it's definitely strategy.
Good luck, bud.

683
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,716
>> If you get voted off
tonight, we'll miss your sage

684
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,652
comments around camp.
Right now, man, it's all about

685
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:31,729
team and winning.
>> I'm just playing the

686
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:39,804
team and winning.
>> I'm just playing the

687
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,472
game, man.
I started playing it when I got

688
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,874
to the beach.
It's all part of the game.

689
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,883
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

690
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,898
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

691
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,234
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

692
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,469
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

693
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:17,474
The first vote.
Chris.

694
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,614
Chris.
That's two votes Chris.

695
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:30,554
Rory.
Brook.

696
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,560
Brook.
That's two votes Brook, two

697
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,863
votes Chris.
One vote Rory.

698
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:45,970
Chris.
Brook.

699
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:48,405
Three votes Brook,
three votes Chris.

700
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:53,644
One vote Rory.
Brook.

701
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:57,581
Four votes Brook,
three votes Chris.

702
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,618
First person voted out of
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu-- Islands of</i>

703
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:05,289
<i>Fire--</i> Brook.
You need to bring your torch.

704
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:20,704
Brook, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

705
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,582
Three different tribe members
received votes.

706
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,585
You guys are going back to camp.
No water, no fire, 'cause you're

707
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,921
going to earn it or you're going
to build it.

708
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,822
You guys can head back to camp.
Good night.

709
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,706
>> Stay tuned for scenes from
our next episode.

710
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,479
>> Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>
Lines are drawn at Lopevi.

711
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,882
>> You are so friggin'
dangerous, man.

712
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,951
>> Who else is a threat?
>> PROBST: At Yasur, things

713
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,285
are bleak.
>> It's so miserable.

714
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,455
Being here is like being in
prison.

715
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,358
>> PROBST: And Rory gets mad.
>> That was nonsense.

716
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,660
That was classless.
>> I just don't think,

717
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,696
you know...
>> Show some class!

718
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,004
>> The one thing I didn't want
was to be the first person off.

719
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,473
Who the hell wants to be the
first person off?

720
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,875
But, uh, during these three days
in the game, I don't think I

721
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,878
have learned much about myself.
My only problem was, the other

722
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,848
17 people here just gave me an
absolute schooling in the game

723
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,417
of<i> Survivor,</i> so...
Uh, you know, I got beat.

724
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,486
The bottom line-- someone
got me. They got me good.

725
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,021
Peace out, Survivorland.
