Deep in the heart of Africa, two

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,381
tribes have been battling.

5
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,091

6

How does that happen?

7
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,094
Kota, the yellow tribe, has won

8
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,178
six out of eight challenges and

9
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,139
lives very well.

10

00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,017

14
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,395
has struggled with everything,

15
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,646
and squandered most of their

16
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,188
food.

17
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,314

20
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,860
Sugar were tight with each other

21
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:27,235
and no one else.

22
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,195

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,451

Fang discovered the idol, they

27
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,414

00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,930
weakness and voted him out.

GC, the tribe has spoken.

40
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,893
Can Fang turn it around?

41
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,436
And can Ace and Sugar survive

42
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,188
another Tribal Council?

43
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,731

make some sort of ring-type

00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,298
>> We're gaining on them.

383
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:37,882
>> PROBST: Fang is fading very

384
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,592
quickly.

385
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,926
>> Drop half the people and we

386
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,635
sprint.

387
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,887
Go. Just get off.

388
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,305
>> Okay.

389
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,515
>> Sugar, go. Kenny, go.

390
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,183
>> Run!

391
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,225
>> PROBST: Sugar and Kenny both

392
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,810
drop out, and that seems to

393
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,519
help Fang.

394
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,353
>> Come on, guys.

395
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,438
>> PROBST: They're now moving

396
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,689
much more quickly.

397
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,231
>> Put 'em down right now.

398
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,525
>> Go, Kelly. Get out of here.

399
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,611
Just unhook.

400
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,236
>> PROBST: Kelly has now dropped

401
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,945
out.

402
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,530
>> Let's do this!

403
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,490
>> PROBST: Fang is down to

404
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,659
three members.

405
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,744
>> Come on, guys.

406
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,287
>> PROBST: Susie drops out for

407
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,413
Kota.

408
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,373
Fang now getting some distance

409
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,042
on Kota now that they've lost

410
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,794
Kenny and Sugar and Kelly.

411
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,341
>> I'm getting tired.

412
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:20,966
>> PROBST: Crystal is starting

413
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,218
to drag now.

414
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,220
>> They're dragging.

415
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,846
Come on!

416
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,016
>> PROBST: Matty pushing her.

417
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,392
Frustrated.

418
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,477
>> Crystal, just drop out if you

419
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,186
can't do it!

420
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,103
>> PROBST: Crystal now drops

421
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:33,270
out.

422
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,522
>> I can't take all that

423
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,189
weight, Matty.

424
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,023
>> Come on. Let's go!

425
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,483
>> PROBST: It's all on Matty

426
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,484
and Ace.

427
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,361
Big opening for Kota now.

428
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,654
>> Yeah, you've got this!

429
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,404
>> PROBST: Kota with five

430
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,573
strong guys going up against

431
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,075
Matty and Ace, who are

432
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:46,992
struggling.

433
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,911
>> Come on the side of me!

434
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,079
Come on the side of me, man!

435
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,830
(grunting)

436
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,540
Come on, grab it!

437
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,832
>> PROBST: Matty carrying half

438
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,209
that snake himself.

439
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,669
Ace dragging the other half.

440
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,128
Ace trying to keep his pants up!

441
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,256
Kota closing in on a big win

442
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,966
and a huge reward.

443
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:02,841
>> Yeah!

444
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,092
Yeah!

445
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,386
Yeah!

446
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,596
>> PROBST: Kota wins reward.

447
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,849
>> Yeah!

448
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,892
>> Not even close.

449
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,268
Not even close.

450
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,227
Nice.

451
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,311
>> You all right, Bob?

452
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,854
>> Oh, God.

453
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,981
>> If I can do it at your age...

454
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,986
>> PROBST: Kota,

455
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,654
congratulations.

456
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,073
This reward has enough for you

457
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,074
to sample a little now and

458
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,159
still have plenty to take back

459
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,369
to camp.

460
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,745
>> Can you share?

461
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,454
>> Can we have one?

462
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,998
>> Uh, no.

463
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,624
>> Everyone grab one of these.

464
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,083
>> Thank you, Jeff.

465
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,127
>> Ooh, I want some

466
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,754
strawberries.

467
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,631
>> Mmm!

468
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,967
>> Crystal, what hurts more,

469
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,052
losing or seeing this tempting

470
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,096
array of food in front of you

471
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,055
and knowing you can't have it?

472
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,641
>> Losing over and over.

473
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,809
(sniffles)

474
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,476
It's starting to hurt.

475
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,269
>> PROBST: Something you're not

476
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:55,477
used to.

477
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,479
>> No.

478
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,107
>> Waah, waah, waah!

479
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,775
>> PROBST: All right, Kota, who

480
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,693
are you going to send from Fang

481
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,068
to Exile Island?

482
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,069
>> Sugar.

483
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,988
>> PROBST: Sugar, for the

484
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,449
fourth time, you'll be sent to

485
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,950
Exile Island.

486
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:10,951
Sugar, you will return in time

487
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,037
for the next immunity challenge.

488
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,082
Fang, got nothing for you.

489
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,459
Grab your stuff.

490
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,586
Head back to camp.

491
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,298
>> I love winning challenges.

492
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,924
More importantly than winning

493
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,469
challenges, I absolutely love

494
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,471
watching them lose.

495
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:30,846
>> PROBST: Kota,

496
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:31,180
congratulations.

497
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,141
Come get your reward.

498
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,353
>> Randy? To me, he's just...

499
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,103
He's a troll.

500
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,647
He's a troll under the bridge

501
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,731
that's just mean and angry with

502
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,024
the world.

503
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,192
I don't play like that.

504
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,444
Do not disrespect me like that.

505
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,029
I have a feeling that in the

506
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,822
event there's a merge, that

507
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,991
old Fang and new Fang won't

508
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,118
get along.

509
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,132
>> No pun intended, but sweet.

510
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,843
>> Today's challenge just showed

511
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,427
that Kota is a strong, unified

512
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,679
team.

513
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,138
And I'm so excited to see that.

514
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,223
I mean, when it works like a

515
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,810
charm in the challenges, there's

516
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,769
just no better feeling.

517
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,395
>> I think we need a table to

518
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,229
sit down and have breakfast at.

519
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,564
>> Has anyone thought about how

520
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,565
we want to split this up?

521
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,692
>> Charlie had a great idea.

522
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,568
Split it up, and each

523
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,152
individual person can just eat

524
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,195
their share as they want.

525
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,532
>> Well, I know that, um, there

526
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,491
are definitely seven

527
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,367
croissants and there's seven

528
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,201
of these jelly things.

529
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:34,993
>> Okay.

530
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,120
>> And then we could figure out

531
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,079
how many's in the middle.

532
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,163
>> So, if someone doesn't want

533
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,707
an eclair, they can get an

534
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,874
extra one of these.

535
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,542
If someone doesn't want

536
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,209
a Cinnabon, they can get one

537
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:42,835
of those.

538
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,502
>> If it wasn't for Dan, we

539
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,461
wouldn't have rationing laws,

540
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,295
so when the pastries came

541
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,046
back, like, the old Kota

542
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,215
members like me, Marcus, and

543
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,467
Charlie are already like, "How

544
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,135
are we going to divide this?"

545
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,511
So we tried to make it as fair

546
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:52,803
as possible.

547
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,263
>> This will be...

548
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,723
>> This should just be gravy.

549
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,267
>> What do you mean gravy?

550
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:58,517
>> Extra.

551
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,310
Go with the original plan, which

552
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,147
was cook dinner and, um, you

553
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,733
know, this is just...

554
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:08,819
>> Yeah, 'cause that will give

555
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:09,403
us one more meal on the back

556
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,446
end.

557
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,029
>> Exactly.

558
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:11,655
>> That's why it's a good idea.

559
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,073
>> I don't want to be hungry

560
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,366
come midnight.

561
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,410
>> Dan, he has annoyed

562
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:16,660
everybody.

563
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,121
He's even annoyed me a little

564
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:19,955
bit.

565
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,873
>> This is so good.

566
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:21,290
I can't stop.

567
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,292
>> Yeah, it does.

568
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:23,876
It feels so good when it hits

569
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,335
my lips.

570
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,879
>> My best move might be to

571
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,505
just kind of slowly distance

572
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,924
myself from Dan as I bring

573
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,634
myself closer to the original

574
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,218
Kota.

575
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,013
>> God, those pastries are good.

576
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:36,388
>> Go for it.

577
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:36,972
>> If I take one bite, I only

578
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,515
have one and a half left.

579
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,808
>> It's a reward.

580
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,934
There's no rationing.

581
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,020
>> Don't do that.

582
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,737
>> I knew that they were

583
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,030
probably going to send me back

584
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:53,322
to Exile.

585
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,073
This is lame.

586
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,200
Why-why...

587
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,539
Why do I get to come back here

588
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,123
and...

589
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,501
Eat fruit when everybody is

590
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,086
starving at my tribe, and

591
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,212
they're running out of food,

592
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,296
and they don't have anything

593
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,047
but rice.

594
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,133
And I'm feeling really guilty.

595
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,639
I just feel bad knowing that I

596
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,848
already have the idol.

597
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,308
Actually, I gave Ace the idol in

598
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,686
case he needs it before Tribal,

599
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,438
but...

600
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,398
Well, we'll see if that happens.

601
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,905
>> I wouldn't mind getting some

602
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,656
more of the fruit.

603
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,907
>> Hey, this is my opinion.

604
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,158
Today it's super mellow out.

605
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,743
>> Re-hydrate.

606
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,536
>> Tomorrow we're going to have

607
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,370
a big day, and it's probably

608
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,538
going to be super hot.

609
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,580
So we might as well get

610
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,248
everything done today, get all

611
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,207
the canteens filled.

612
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,125
>> I don't know why you're

613
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,002
stressing over it.

614
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:49,670
>> I'm not stressing.

615
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,381
>> Yes, you are.

616
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,591
>> Fang lost another challenge.

617
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,051
We needed that food because

618
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,095
I'm, like, withering away, and

619
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,221
we have, like, three scoops

620
00:18:59,304 --> 00:18:59,721
of rice.

621
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,347
And then, Crystal's reaction

622
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,641
of our loss was huge.

623
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,393
She just, like, broke down in

624
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:04,977
tears.

625
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,019
Personally, I just think her

626
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,105
personality sucks.

627
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,650
>> I know.

628
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,318
Like, seriously, that all just,

629
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,194
like, sucks.

630
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,488
It's like a damper on the team.

631
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,739
Like, you don't need to cry,

632
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,824
right?

633
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,783
>> Well, it's just a different

634
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,367
sort of cry than uh...

635
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,494
Sugar's cry is more a...

636
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,078
>> Emotional.

637
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,037
>> Emotional, I'm happy to be

638
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,123
here.

639
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,420
>> Right.

640
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,881
>> Don't view my tears at

641
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,133
today's challenge as a sign of

642
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,092
weakness.

643
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,220
Because it's far from that.

644
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,056
You and Kelly view me as weak

645
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,765
now because I was crying?

646
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,434
>> Not weak.

647
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,560
>> Where did they go, up by the

648
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,186
hill or they went by tree mail?

649
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,856
>> By tree mail and by the hill.

650
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,441
>> I hope that they don't put

651
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,233
me in the same category as GC,

652
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,903
someone that wants to give up.

653
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,738
Because shortly after I got

654
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,156
back to camp, I snapped out of

655
00:19:59,239 --> 00:19:59,698
my funk.

656
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,867
But Kelly hasn't had two words

657
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,535
to say to me, and so now she's

658
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,077
going to feel the wrath of

659
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:04,286
Crystal.

660
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,914
>> Hey, how did you get here?

661
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,332
>> Same way you got here.

662
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,041
>> Really?

663
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:09,750
>> She walked.

664
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,459
>> Are you feeling better?

665
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,920
>> Yeah, I mean, y'all have

666
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,004
already had the comforts of

667
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:14,755
food.

668
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,256
I mean, you guys have had fish.

669
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,301
I've had a pinch of a freaking

670
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,303
sardine.

671
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:21,803
You know what I'm saying?

672
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,679
>> Mm-hmm.

673
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,305
>> But, like I tell you and like

674
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,848
I tell everybody else in my

675
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,892
tribe: don't mistake my tears

676
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,226
as a sign of weakness because

677
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,020
at some point, we all get

678
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:30,938
depressed.

679
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,897
It's just that mine come out

680
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,149
through my eyes, you know.

681
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,150
I mean, I think I can still

682
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:35,692
battle with the best of them

683
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,070
and just don't mistake it as a

684
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:38,862
sign of weakness because it's

685
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,029
not.

686
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,114
But I'm fine now.

687
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,032
>> I definitely think that

688
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,033
Crystal crying in front of

689
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:43,659
the Kota tribe and our tribe, it

690
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,452
shows a sign of weakness.

691
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,703
Like, you could take it

692
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,871
either which way, you know.

693
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,039
Like, she can explain it to us,

694
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,582
but she can't explain it to the

695
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:50,874
Kota tribe.

696
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,668
>> I think more so with me, it

697
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,669
wasn't the danish, it was the

698
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,336
pride.

699
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,921
>> It just sucks,

700
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:56,463
especially when you lose,

701
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,424
and we lose every time.

702
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,981
>> Marcus.

703
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:14,940
A giant turtle.

704
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,233
>> A giant turtle?

705
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:16,858
>> Not giant, but big enough.

706
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,404
>> Okay, hold on, hold on.

707
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,530
Hold on.

708
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,364
Let me give you my shirt or

709
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:22,614
something.

710
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,074
Untie me.

711
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,493
I'll bring the boat around.

712
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,161
>> Your hands are too important.

713
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,204
Hold on.

714
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,247
>> Listen to me.

715
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:30,872
I don't want you to lose your

716
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,915
hand.

717
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,499
>> It doesn't matter.

718
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,959
It's food.

719
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:34,835
>> Whoo!

720
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,460
>> All right, we've got a

721
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,461
turtle!

722
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,422
I was really excited because it

723
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,423
was like winning a reward

724
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,341
challenge, except we did it

725
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,218
ourselves, so it had that extra

726
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,052
bit of joy to it.

727
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,970
>> That is neat.

728
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:45,303
>> You know...

729
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,179
You know how to cook that,

730
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:46,555
right?

731
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,431
>> That's good size.

732
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,390
>> Kill it and then crack the

733
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,684
shell, break it out, and cut it

734
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,476
in cubes and boil it.

735
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,102
>> Wow.

736
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:52,644
>> Go for it.

737
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,645
I'm excited about it.

738
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,229
I think it's going to taste

739
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:55,022
good.

740
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,565
Have you ever had gumbo turtle

741
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,568
soup here in the jungles of

742
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,110
Africa?

743
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,111
How cool is that?

744
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:01,987
>> It's going to be delish.

745
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,529
I know it.

746
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,406
>> That's delicious.

747
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,741
>> That is so good.

748
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,993
Mmm.

749
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,953
>> I can't complain.

750
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,371
>> Right now, the Kota tribe is

751
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,165
probably at our highest high.

752
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,207
The fact that we caught a

753
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,917
turtle has just knocked us up

754
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,044
ten notches.

755
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,336
Fang better watch out.

756
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,463
>> (muffled): I love it.

757
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:38,815
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

758
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:39,858
We'll now bring in Sugar,

759
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,609
returning from Exile Island.

760
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,070
>> Howdy.

761
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,571
>> Hi.

762
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,450
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

763
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:48,950
ready to get to today's

764
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,409
challenge?

765
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,203
>> Yep.

766
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,496
>> PROBST: First things first.

767
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,580
You're hiding it back there,

768
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,707
Charlie.

769
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,422
Once again, immunity is back up

770
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,632
for grabs.

771
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,634
For today's challenge, each

772
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,511
tribe will divide into three

773
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:07,719
pairs.

774
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,596
Each pair will be tethered

775
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,555
together by rope.

776
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,432
On my go, the first pair will

777
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,726
crawl under a cargo net, race

778
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,187
into the jungle, navigate an

779
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,605
obstacle and retrieve two

780
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,440
sections of a flagpole, then

781
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,775
race back.

782
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,110
Then the next pair goes.

783
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,362
Each leg of the challenge adds

784
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,072
another obstacle, making it

785
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,490
more difficult.

786
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,741
First tribe to collect all

787
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,119
three pairs of flagpole pieces

788
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,453
and assemble it correctly wins

789
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,454
immunity.

790
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,706
Safe at least one more day in

791
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,707
this game.

792
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,417
Losers, Tribal Council,

793
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,378

794
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,295
Make sense?

795
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,046
>> Yes.

796
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,839
>> PROBST: Kota, you have one

797
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,548
extra member.

798
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,132
You're going to have to sit

799
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,091
somebody out.

800
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:46,800
Who's it going to be?

801
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,592
Susie, you're going to sit this

802
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:47,843

Everybody else, I'll give you

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,351
>> PROBST: This is where

954
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,437
teamwork is going to win or lose

955
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:50,812
this challenge.

956
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,649
Kota working together very well.

957
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,068
>> Get out of the way!

958
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,236
>> PROBST: Ace not wanting help

959
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,949
from anyone.

960
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:03,950
After coming so close, Fang now

961
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,828
falling behind.

962
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,956
Ace trying to muscle it in.

963
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,832
All the pieces will interlock.

964
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,791
You don't need to force

965
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,919
anything.

966
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,589
Kota quickly working together

967
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,257
on assembling their flagpole.

968
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,008
>> It's not going in!

969
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,010
>> PROBST: Ace still struggling

970
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,345
to make sense of this.

971
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,268
(cheering)

972
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,229
Kota wins immunity once again!

973
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,063
>> Good job, guys!

974
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:34,856
>> Yes!

975
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,941
>> Yes!

976
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,826
>> PROBST: Kota, once again,

977
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,787
immunity is yours.

978
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,917
Kota, not much to say.

979
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,668
You continue to dominate

980
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,002
in this game.

981
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,587
Enjoy it.

982
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,338
Grab your stuff.

983
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,756
Head back to camp.

984
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,548
>> Thanks, Jeff.

985
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,008
>> PROBST: And Fang, once again,

986
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,302
Tribal Council, all yours.

987
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,553
And if you continue to play

988
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,638
like individuals, you'll be

989
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,931
there every time.

990
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:08,932
Tonight, one of the six of you

991
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,517
going home.

992
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,476
You have the afternoon to

993
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,352
figure out who it's going to be.

994
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,269
Grab your stuff.

995
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,687
Head back to camp.

996
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,606
>> Ace is a tyrant and a bully

997
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,733
and a lot of people see Ace as

998
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:19,859
a strong competitor, but he's

999
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,944
been in our tribe for three or

1000
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,362
four challenges now, and we

1001
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,197
haven't won anything.

1002
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:33,164
So, how is he benefiting me?

1003
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,375
♪ ♪

1004
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,842
>> The challenge was

1005
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,677
challenging.

1006
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,636
There were a couple of people

1007
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,179
that died right at the end.

1008
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,264
I was expecting more from

1009
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,640
Kelly, and she really just sort

1010
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,975
of petered out.

1011
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,977
She goes, it strengthens the

1012
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,937
team, and I think she's just

1013
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,314
irritating and really dumb.

1014
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,065
Kelly's going home tonight.

1015
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,025
It would be stupid not to send

1016
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,068
her.

1017
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,194
>> All right, don't get mad at

1018
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,113
me when I say this, but, uh, if

1019
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,990
we, if we merge at nine...

1020
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:07,240
>> Yeah.

1021
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,950
>> And we go into the last

1022
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,118
three ,and it's going to be you,

1023
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,370
Sugar or me, she can play the

1024
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,913
idol and I can leave, dude.

1025
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,998
I think we should flush the

1026
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,376
idol tonight.

1027
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,044
You and I and her, that's too

1028
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,129
much of a risk.

1029
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,463
Why can't we play it tonight?

1030
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,965
>> Matty, look at me.

1031
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:24,465
She can't play the idol.

1032
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,883
Trust me.

1033
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:26,634
>> If it's us three...

1034
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,427
>> Trust me.

1035
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,553
>> Okay, all right, I trust

1036
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,054
you then.

1037
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,598
>> Matty wanted to get the idol

1038
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,890
out and I just tried to convey

1039
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,851
to him that he doesn't really

1040
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,185
have to worry about that to that

1041
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:36,936
extent because although I don't

1042
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,063
want to tell him I have the

1043
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,982
idol; obviously, I do.

1044
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,984
Man, don't worry about the idol.

1045
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,404
I promise we'll take care of it.

1046
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,113
>> All right.

1047
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:47,405
Kelly, then.

1048
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,698
>> Kelly.

1049
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,699
>> Okay.

1050
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,783
>> The alliance is sound.

1051
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,118
I would hope to trust Matty.

1052
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,244
Sugar I pretty much trust

1053
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,454
completely.

1054
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,413
I don't see any reason why

1055
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,873
Kenny would not go with what it

1056
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:57,832
is, and I think it makes sense

1057
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:58,791
for everyone to get rid of

1058
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,918
Kelly.

1059
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,762
>> Why not?

1060
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,387
>> Because it's not going to

1061
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:11,596
work.

1062
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,805
That's what I tried to run by

1063
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,348
Ace right when I got here.

1064
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,140
>> Why do you trust Ace?

1065
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,142
>> Who said I did?

1066
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,810
>> Well, then, when you went to

1067
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,645
talk to him in the woods, what

1068
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,145
did you ask him?

1069
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,732
What did he say?

1070
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,442
>> He said, "Kelly."

1071
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,193
"Kelly."

1072
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,112
I said, "I guess.

1073
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,739
That sound good to me, dude."

1074
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,823
>> I really want Ace out of

1075
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,449
here.

1076
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,784
>> We can't vote Ace off.

1077
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:33,701
We have to win a freaking

1078
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:33,993
immunity...

1079
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,203
>> Have you won one yet since

1080
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,537
he's been here?

1081
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:36,746
Okay.

1082
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,039
>> I don't know what's going

1083
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:38,498
through Matty's head.

1084
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,999
He's running and telling Ace

1085
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,209
everything and Ace ain't

1086
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:41,709
running and telling him

1087
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,835
anything.

1088
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,628
>> Let's just get out Kelly.

1089
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,754
I don't know why we have to

1090
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,046
get...

1091
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,173
Let's just start with this.

1092
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,133
>> Okay.

1093
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,553
I'm still very leery of Ace and

1094
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,097
Sugar because they are in an

1095
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,392
alliance, and Kenny, myself,

1096
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,227
and Matty, we have to be leery

1097
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,311
of everything that's going on

1098
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,522
around us.

1099
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,485
>> Something is up tonight.

1100
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:07,777
>> Matty...

1101
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,069
>> No, no.

1102
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,779
>> He's just riding the fence.

1103
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,823
>> Right now, the safest best is

1104
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:12,573
to write down Kelly.

1105
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,700
>> Ace is probably writing down

1106
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,158
Kelly.

1107
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,910
Sugar is writing down Kelly.

1108
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,704
>> Matty is writing down Kelly.

1109
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,163
>> Matty is writing down Kelly.

1110
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,540
Right now, I'm really torn

1111
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,874
'cause I really want Ace out of

1112
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,208
here.

1113
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,251
>> Do we trust Ace or Kelly?

1114
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,003
I don't trust Ace.

1115
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:26,462
>> I don't trust Ace.

1116
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,673
>> Crystal knows something's up,

1117
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,384
and she does not trust Matty.

1118
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,136
Crystal is on to something.

1119
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,387
Right now, know what Crystal

1120
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,595
told me?

1121
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,139
She told me that, "Yeah, I'm

1122
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:36,764
worried about Matty, that he's

1123
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,515
flipping."

1124
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,266
And I'm like, "Don't worry.

1125
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,183
We're sticking together."

1126
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,435
Crystal said, "Okay."

1127
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,477
>> All that we have to know is

1128
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,145
that Kelly goes next.

1129
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:42,437
That's it.

1130
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,813
That's all we have to know

1131
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,480
right now.

1132
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,857
>> Or blindside Ace.

1133
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,274
>> I can't.

1134
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,400
I made a promise that I can't

1135
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:47,608
break.

1136
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,527
>> Yeah, but, man, you can't

1137
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,570
trust someone like that when

1138
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,988
they say they have an agreement.

1139
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,072
>> We made a serious agreement.

1140
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,949
He swore on his mother.

1141
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:55,950
>> You got to think it over.

1142
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,618
Matty, like, you just can't take

1143
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,411
anybody's word.

1144
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,912
In order for you and me to

1145
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,205
guarantee to make the merge,

1146
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,415
we have to blindside Ace and

1147
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,000
then that's a guaranteed merge

1148
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:04,917
for you and me.

1149
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,252
I don't trust Ace at all.

1150
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,295
I know he's sneaky.

1151
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,838
I know he has alliances

1152
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:09,922
back in the Kota tribe.

1153
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:10,548
And Sugar's going to go with Ace

1154
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,133
no matter what.

1155
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,342
So I was like, I had to talk to

1156
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,471
Sugar on a one-on-one basis.

1157
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,222
It's weird 'cause his game, you

1158
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,891
see people who are really honest

1159
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,142
and sweet, kind of get, like,

1160
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,603
their heads chopped off by

1161
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,145
people like...

1162
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:24,729
>> That's why I connected with

1163
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,271
Ace.

1164
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,481
>> By people like...

1165
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,732
>> Ace.

1166
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:27,982
>> Ace.

1167
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:28,274
(laughs)

1168
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,568
So I figured, you know, maybe

1169
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,028
we could stick together.

1170
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,952
>> I know.

1171
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,245
I know, huh?

1172
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,248
>> I was so shocked today when

1173
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,709
Sugar told me that she gave the

1174
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,794
hidden immunity idol to Ace.

1175
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,379
And I was like, "Wait. What?!"

1176
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,631
Since you gave the idol to

1177
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,258
Ace, that just shows that you he

1178
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,051
is...

1179
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:55,802
>> Well, he didn't ask for it.

1180
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,177
I gave it to him.

1181
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,803
>> You just gave it to him on

1182
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:57,678
your own will.

1183
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:57,887
>> Yeah.

1184
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,055
He didn't, like, talk me out of

1185
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,348
it or anything, but I know Ace

1186
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,474
is a sneak.

1187
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,726
>> Yeah, he's very sleazy.

1188
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,858
>> I just wanted to let you

1189
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,109
know that they took the idol out

1190
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:12,693
of your bag-- I mean, out of

1191
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,612
your jacket-- so you don't think

1192
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,488
that somebody else did it.

1193
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:15,780
>> Oh, okay.

1194
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,073
>> But I don't think I need to

1195
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:17,615
play it, right?

1196
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,157
>> No.

1197
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,492
>> You're sure I'm good?

1198
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,117
>> Yeah.

1199
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,035
>> Okay, cool.

1200
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:22,078
>> All right.

1201
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,246
>> All right.

1202
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,792
>> I told Sugar, "Always keep

1203
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,418
the idol with you, you know.

1204
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,878
In case something happens."

1205
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,713
I just made sure that it's not

1206
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,048
in the snake's hands, Ace's

1207
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,341
hands and it's back to Sugar's

1208
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,926
hands.

1209
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,053
>> Uh, the deal with Sugar and

1210
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,973
the idol is she has it, and I

1211
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:42,598
think it's quite possible Sugar

1212
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,642
thinks "I've used Ace to the

1213
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,143
extent that I can."

1214
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,937
I'm not particularly worried in

1215
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,480
relation to my own regard at the

1216
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,565
moment.

1217
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,566
I'm going in confident.

1218
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,233
That could be the worst thing

1219
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,360
possible.

1220
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,336
(Probst sighs)

1221
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:12,879
>> PROBST: So, out of ten

1222
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,883
challenges, you have won two.

1223
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,801
Matty, what is the mood of this

1224
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,385
tribe?

1225
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,805
>> We're... cursed.

1226
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,347
(laughing)

1227
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,891
There's something in our water.

1228
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,058
There's something in our rice.

1229
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,852
But I think we have a curse.

1230
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,145
>> PROBST: Kelly, what's your

1231
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:29,604
take on this tribe?

1232
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,899
>> Um, we just can't come, like,

1233
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,483
as a team, and just, like, work

1234
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:34,775
together.

1235
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,401
>> PROBST: I think Kelly hit it

1236
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,819
on the head.

1237
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,945
What I saw today at the

1238
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,281
challenge is a group of people

1239
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,575
working as individuals.

1240
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,534
>> Jeff, when it came to

1241
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,660
putting that flag and pole

1242
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,162
together, I really, honestly

1243
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,830
felt like Ace wanted to be the

1244
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,665
person to put it all together.

1245
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,124
"We got to try this."

1246
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,000
We got to try this."

1247
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,919
I'm like, "We can all piece it

1248
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:53,586
together."

1249
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,420
>> PROBST: Ace, do you think

1250
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,755
you guys were effective in how

1251
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,797
you were working at the end,

1252
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,548
trying to put that flag

1253
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,132
together?

1254
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,343
>> No, we didn't come together

1255
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,260
as a group.

1256
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,137
And I think I can apportion

1257
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,348
definitely a larger percentage

1258
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,600
of the blame for how it went

1259
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,101
together at the end.

1260
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:09,894
>> PROBST: Crystal, would it

1261
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,478
be fair to give Ace a vote,

1262
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,563
simply because you thought you

1263
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,522
knew how to do it, and you

1264
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,065
didn't?

1265
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:14,315
>> Yes.

1266
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,442
>> PROBST: Surprise you, Ace?

1267
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,277
>> Nothing surprises me in

1268
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,155
Tribal Council, honestly.

1269
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,448
>> PROBST: Crystal, you've

1270
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,950
been upset at a lot of

1271
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:24,575
challenges.

1272
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,451
Tears have come out often.

1273
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,453
Do you think it's starting to

1274
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,412
have an impact?

1275
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,747
>> Oh, definitely.

1276
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,456
Some of my tribemates tend to

1277
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,250
take it as weakness and will

1278
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,418
very well use it against me

1279
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:34,669
tonight.

1280
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,087
>> PROBST: Kelly, you're

1281
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,171
nodding your head.

1282
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,547
>> Um, I never said she was

1283
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,966
weak, but when somebody cries,

1284
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:40,967
it's just like, "Why are you

1285
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,384
crying?"

1286
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,718
Clearly something is, like,

1287
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,054
you're just not stable.

1288
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:45,763
>> You don't know where my

1289
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,138
tears come from.

1290
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,223
Yeah, I'm hurt because we're

1291
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:47,473
losing.

1292
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,349
We're not eating.

1293
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,350
We're not winning.

1294
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,309
And if you don't understand

1295
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,812
that, you won't last too much

1296
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,354
longer in the game yourself.

1297
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,772
>> Okay...

1298
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,982
>> And you took me crying one

1299
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,108
time as a sign of weakness?

1300
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:57,525
I don't think so.

1301
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,735
>> Okay, well, I didn't say that

1302
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,237
you were weak, so you can take

1303
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,196
what you want.

1304
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,948
>> Next question, please.

1305
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,241
>> PROBST: Now, Kelly didn't say

1306
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:05,741
you were weak.

1307
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,450
Kelly said you were unstable.

1308
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,411
>> Yeah, that's worse.

1309
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,537
>> She didn't explain to us why

1310
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,204
she was crying.

1311
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:10,955
I asked is her afterwards if she

1312
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:11,205
was okay.

1313
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:11,956
She told me...

1314
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,541
You don't have to explain.

1315
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,583
It's understood.

1316
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,334
And sometimes you don't have to

1317
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:15,960
have things written out in black

1318
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,086
and white.

1319
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,713
I'm not crying over no doggone

1320
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,505
danishes, okay?

1321
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,049
Really, it gets frustrating,

1322
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,884
Kelly; it really does.

1323
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,677
We've been down and out from

1324
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,928
day one.

1325
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,430
But you wouldn't understand it

1326
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:27,930
because you came from a

1327
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:28,514
a winning situation.

1328
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,725
>> I'm not banging her down.

1329
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,851
Like, I just saw her cry.

1330
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,185
That doesn't mean anything.

1331
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:33,936
I wasn't the only one talking

1332
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,228
about it.

1333
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,354
Ace talked about it...

1334
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,106
>> Whoa, before you start to try

1335
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:37,732
and throw people under busses

1336
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,859
for no apparent reason, the only

1337
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,402
thing I said about Crystal was I

1338
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,445
actually understood because

1339
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,739
it's frustrating losing over and

1340
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,364
over again, just so it drives

1341
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,326
you up the wall.

1342
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,201
>> PROBST: Kelly, the whole

1343
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:49,827
time Ace was talking, you had a

1344
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,163
look on your face like, "Not

1345
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:52,997
true."

1346
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,415
>> He is 100% double-talking and

1347
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,624
it's just just so annoying, I

1348
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,001
just, like, don't even know how

1349
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:57,710
to explain it.

1350
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,544
>> Honestly, Kelly, I would

1351
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,795
be impressed if you understood

1352
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,756
what I was saying half the time.

1353
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,840
>> He always has to have the

1354
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,549
last word.

1355
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:07,386
It's disgusting.

1356
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,471
>> PROBST: Matty, you seem like

1357
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,057
one of the few guys tonight who

1358
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,640
might have reason to actually

1359
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,517
not be worried.

1360
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,103
>> There's no sort of semblance

1361
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,730
or logic in this tribe, though.

1362
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,647
>> PROBST: That must be

1363
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,398
maddening when you get to the

1364
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,274
vote.

1365
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:21,025
There are so many people,

1366
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:21,609
tonight, it feels like, that

1367
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,736
are on the chopping block.

1368
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,154
>> It could be any one of us.

1369
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,614
It really could be any single

1370
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,990
one of us tonight.

1371
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,533
>> PROBST: Well, it sounds like

1372
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,826
it's going to be an interesting

1373
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,660
vote.

1374
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,703
It is time to vote.

1375
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,289
Ace, you're up.

1376
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,632
>> My dear, this has been a

1377
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,009
been a long time in the coming.

1378
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,136
Hopefully, it happens tonight.

1379
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,037
>> Forget you.

1380
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,164
Go home.

1381
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:22,586
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1382
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,131
votes.

1383
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,722
If anybody has the hidden

1384
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,682
immunity idol and you want to

1385
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,516
play it, now would be the time

1386
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,643
to do so.

1387
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,398
Okay.

1388
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:42,982
Once the votes are read, the

1389
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:43,566
decision is final.

1390
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,151
The person voted out will be

1391
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,026
asked to leave the Tribal

1392
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,403
Council area immediately.

1393
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:51,407
I'll read the votes.

1394
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,703
First vote: Kelly.

1395
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,496
Crystal.

1396
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:57,872
One vote Kelly;

1397
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,500
one vote Crystal.

1398
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,169
Kelly.

1399
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:03,961
Two votes Kelly;

1400
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,714
one vote Crystal.

1401
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,799
Kelly.

1402
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,092
That's three votes Kelly;

1403
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,596
one vote Crystal.

1404
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,847
Sixth person voted out of

1405
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,848
<i>Survivor: Gabon:</i> Kelly.

1406
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,016
That's four.

1407
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,142
That's enough.

1408
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,811
You need to bring me your torch.

1409
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,489
Kelly, the tribe has spoken.

1410
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,574
Time for you to go.

1411
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:49,673
Well, tonight was the first

1412
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,550
Tribal Council that I saw some

1413
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,303
true passion.

1414
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,387
Maybe that's what's been

1415
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,096
missing.

1416
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,972
Time will tell.

1417
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:57,389
Grab your torches.

1418
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:57,765
Head back to camp.

1419
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,683
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i>

Both tribes are going to vote

1431
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,248
somebody out.

1432
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,041
>> Susie has made it far

1433
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,209
enough in this game.

1434
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,335
>> Blindside Ace.

1435
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,211
>> Blindside Ace.

1436
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,087
>> Take Marcus out.

1437
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:28,796
>> Kenny, Crystal, and I vote

1438
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,422
for Sugar.

1439
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,090
>> I think it's going to be

1440
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:31,257
Dan.

1441
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:31,799
>> Crystal thinks Kenny's

1442
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,676
out; Kenny thinks Crystal's out;

1443
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,677
and you're voting Crystal, and

1444
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,761
you're voting Crystal, and Matty

1445
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:36,428
is voting Crystal.

1446
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:36,637
>> Okay.

1447
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,846
>> I was actually going to vote

1448
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,975
you.

1449
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,145
>> I voted for Crystal because,

1450
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:45,479
you know what?

1451
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:46,021
She doesn't really have the

1452
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,274
power to push a team when she's

1453
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:48,816
the one quitting half the

1454
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:49,692
challenges.

1455
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,569
I think the Fang tribe is still

1456
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,028
cursed.

1457
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:53,862
I think they're still going to

1458
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,613
go down.

1459
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,115
They need to work together.

1460
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:56,740
Maybe tonight's Tribal Council,

1461
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,367
they'll communicate better,

1462
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,201
but I definitely wanted to stay

1463
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,035
in the game, but, you know,

1464
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:00,703
if it's my time to go,

1465
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,913
it's my time to go.
