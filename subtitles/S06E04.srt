00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,047

DANIEL:<i> Matthew and I</i>

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,592
<i>and he's a really good ally.</i>

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,760
I can trust him.
You can just tell.

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,220
PROBST:<i> But not everyone</i>
<i>was getting along.</i>

7
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,138
You can handle it by yourself
or not?

8
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,141
Yeah. You're going
to go with me or what?

9
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,434
If you... I'll go do it.

10
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,602
<i>It really got me hot.</i>
<i>I was tempted</i>

11
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,437
to slap the kid around,
to be honest with you.

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,230
PROBST:
<i>At Jaburu, the women</i>

13
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,356
<i>had even bigger problems</i>

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,524
<i>getting it together...</i>

15
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,984
JEANNE:
<i>We've been spinning</i>

16
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,152
<i>our wheels, and</i>

17
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,945
you can't spin your wheels
in the jungle.

18
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,280
PROBST:<i> ...until they decided</i>
<i>to elect a leader.</i>

19
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,907
I, um, initiate Deena.

20
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>Strategically,</i>
<i>Joanna and I decided to put</i>

21
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>Deena up for the leadership</i>

22
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,123
she's going
to create a little friction.

23
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,291
PROBST:
<i>At the reward challenge,</i>

24
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>the girls won some</i>

25
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,626
<i>much-needed bathing supplies.</i>

26
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,462
HEIDI:
<i>The cuter girls kind of</i>

27
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,422
<i>went off from the older women,</i>

28
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,007
<i>because</i>
<i>we've got better bodies,</i>

29
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,467
and that's, like, a huge issue
with older people.

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,012
PROBST:<i> The tribes competed</i>

<i>And the seven women of Jaburu</i>

36
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,604
<i>while Tambaqui's numbers</i>

37
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,148

38
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,274
Daniel, the tribe has spoken.

Another day in the Amazon.

JEANNE:
<i>Today is day number ten,</i>

47
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,750
<i>and our goal was,</i>
<i>everyone wake up early</i>

48
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,544
<i>so we could start getting</i>
<i>some shelter.</i>

49
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,378
<i>Everyone should be</i>

50
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,380
enthusiastic to work today,

51
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,758
'cause we really have to get
some things done around here.

52
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,427
Okay, what are we going
to do today?

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,097
We set a goal every day, and we
end up accomplishing it, so...

54
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,099
We should be going fishing

55
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,183
while everybody else collect
fire wood.

56
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,103
When I woke up, on my shift,
there was no fire wood,

57
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,105
and the fire was gone.

58
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,815
I say,
there's some trifling folk

59
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,610
who was on that shift
before me.

60
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,945
I'll go get enough wood
now to...

61
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,114
JOANNA: Yeah, right.
You did that yesterday.

62
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,616
I know. I don't care.

63
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,329
(chopping)

64
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,587
SHAWNA:<i> Every morning,</i>
<i>I'm woken up by</i>

65
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,339

<i>horrendous looks,</i>

66
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,882
<i>like, aren't I worthless,</i>

67
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,967
<i>looking at me still</i>
<i>in bed, and they're just</i>

68
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,678
<i>constantly trying</i>
<i>to make everyone feel bad</i>

69
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,431
<i>like they're not doing enough.</i>

70
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,350
It's getting
to be a total martyr thing,

71
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,437
and it's driving the tribe,
especially me, up the wall.

72
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,648
JOANNA:
Can we not throw babassu nut

73
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,192
shells around the bed
where we have to sleep?

74
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,193
Can we keep it clean, please?

75
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,278
This is where
our heads are laying at night.

76
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,947
I don't think
any of us meant to.

77
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,490
I'm sorry if we ended up there.

78
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,326
HEIDI:<i> It's always been put</i>
<i>in our heads,</i>

79
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,828
<i>the harder worker gets ahead,</i>
<i>but this is a game.</i>

80
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,039
<i>You have to figure out</i>
<i>what gets you ahead</i>

81
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,458
<i>in the game, not what gets you</i>
<i>ahead in life, so,</i>

82
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,336
my philosophy about Jeanne
and Joanna is,

83
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,546
you want to do
all this extra work,

84
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,341
by all means do it.

85
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,845
<i>I am going to sit here</i>
<i>and take a breath,</i>

86
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,640
<i>maybe take a nap today,</i>
<i>and I guarantee</i>

87
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,810
I'll probably be getting ahead
of you in the game.

88
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,533
Belly's starting to rumble.

89
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,660
BUTCH:
Need more fish now.

90
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,578
MATTHEW:
Not so much as a nibble, huh?

91
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,373
Very evasive fish.

92
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,457
Time to bite, sports fans.

93
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,836
Yeah, it's time to be
a little bit more receptive.

94
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,379
I don't think
they fully understand

95
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,672
just how hungry we are.

96
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,674
DAVE:
<i>We really got to step it up.</i>

97
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,176
<i>We're not maximizing</i>
<i>our main food source,</i>

98
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,929
<i>which is this body</i>
<i>of water that we're next to.</i>

99
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,099
<i>Um, pulling in little</i>
<i>rinky-dink minnows is not</i>

100
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,560
keeping seven healthy,
strong guys alive,

101
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,397
<i>so we got to get food down,</i>
<i>we got to get it done quick.</i>

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,525
There once were three guys
in a boat

103
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,737
who left early
with spirits afloat.

104
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,324
Looking for bass,
sat on their ass.

105
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,953
Luck as good as Rob's jokes.

-(insects chirping)
-There they are.

108
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,082
Successful mission?

109
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,251
We didn't want
to start a trend.

110
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,419
Okay.

111
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,712
BUTCH:<i> We didn't catch</i>
<i>any fish this morning.</i>

112
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,299
<i>It's not going along very good,</i>
<i>but we're going to keep trying.</i>

113
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,884
<i>So we've come up</i>
<i>with another idea.</i>

114
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,218
<i>We have not used worms.</i>

115
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,387
The reason why
we haven't used worms yet is

116
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,389
because we haven't gone
and looked for them.

117
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,225
We're on worm safari.

118
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,397
MATTHEW:
<i>I think that</i>

119
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,607
<i>these worms</i>
<i>are most likely everywhere.</i>

120
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,319
<i>There's no reason</i>
<i>to go on a long</i>

121
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,279
expedition
and exhaust yourself.

122
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,448
<i>But those guys are probably</i>
<i>going collectively</i>

123
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,117
<i>to somewhat exclude me,</i>
<i>which is</i>

124
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,494
likely the case,
but that's cool.

125
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,080
My ego can take it.

126
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,124
<i>I think my biggest challenge</i>
<i>to date has been starting off</i>

127
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,960
<i>on the wrong foot</i>
<i>with my friendship</i>

128
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,671
<i>with Ryan and Dan,</i>
<i>and perhaps not</i>

129
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,632
<i>spending enough time</i>
<i>developing relationships</i>

130
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,967
<i>with other people.</i>

131
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,095
<i>Very often, I'm not included,</i>
<i>and I know it's</i>

132
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:27,595
on purpose.

133
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,639
It's intentional.

134
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,765
Oh.

135
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,310
<i>I believe that</i>
<i>the vote would be against me</i>

137

-Yeah, you got one?
-Got one.

139

Yeah!

140
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,527
Small, but it's a...
it's a worm.

141
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,778
Yeah, it's a worm.

142
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,196
Ah, look at this guy.

143
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,447
Whoa! He's feisty.

144
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,824
Yeah, that's a worm.

145
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,660
-What the hell is that?
-Oh.

146
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,662
-Oh!
-Scorpion.

147
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,080
Baby scorpion! Ew!

148
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,666
DAVE:<i> We started digging for</i>
<i>worms and, yeah, struck gold.</i>

149

<i>So, I think we'll certainly be</i>
<i>able to go in and catch all</i>

<i>the more three-to-five-inch,</i>

151
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,341
yeah, little minnows out here,
and hopefully, a bass or two.

152
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,510
Well, there's a success
for the start of the day.

153

ROGER:
Yeah, that's good.

JOANNA:
When I went back

155
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,694
to the thing, there was another
little fish caught on my...

156
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,821
caught on the... thing.

157
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,030
There was another
little fish?

159

Yeah. Throw it right in.

<i>can put out more effort,</i>

172
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,724
<i>as far as manual work.</i>

173
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,684
And then you've got
the-the smaller girls

174
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,562
that are like
the stay-at-home women, okay?

175
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,771
We were just all
sitting over here

176
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,732
chatting on ways
we deal with not...

177
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,819
with being here, as opposed
to being in our comfort zone.

178
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,030
My mother always tell me,
"This, too, shall pass."

179
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,406
HEIDI:
Yeah.

180
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,742
It's not the first
hard thing I had to do.

181
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,368
There's always sweet rewards,

182
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,745
and-and that anything
worth having

183
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,288
is worth working hard for.

184
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,416
You can't just expect stuff
to come drop in your lap.

185
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,292
HEIDI:
No. No...

186
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,044
JOANNA:
I mean, beauty is deceitful,

187
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,797
and favor is vain,
but a woman that fears the Lord

188
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,049
shall be praised.

189
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,258
(insects buzzing)

190
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,176
Because people
may give you favor,

191
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,220
or pretend
they're your friends, whatever,

192
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,138
for their own purpose
and their own gain,

193
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:34,722
and beauty will fade with time,

194
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,059
but only your virtue

195
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,144
and your character
is what's going to last.

196
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,646
HEIDI:
<i>I'm really not sure how</i>

197
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,150
<i>that quote fit in</i>
<i>with anything, except maybe</i>

198
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,944
she was just trying
to pick on the fact

199
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,195
that we were cute girls,

200
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,614
and we're worrying about stuff
that she's not worrying about?

201
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,157
This, too, shall pass.

202
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,742
I've been keeping that
in the back of my mind.

203
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,287
JENNA:
<i>Don't be mad because</i>

204
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,622
we have good bodies.

205
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,249
It's not our fault.
Get over it.

206
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,625
(laughs)

207
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,795
<i>Me and Heidi are definitely</i>
<i>the skinnier of the group.</i>

208
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,129
(laughs)

209
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,341
<i>And better-looking, but I think</i>
<i>it's definitely a liability.</i>

210
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,301
<i>I think that's what</i>
<i>we were both worried about.</i>

211
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,679
<i>We wanted to be on a tribe</i>
<i>with some men,</i>

212
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,805
<i>because with women--</i>
<i>they can just be</i>

213
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,475
pissed that we have good bodies
and look okay

214
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,602
and just vote us off
as easy as that.

215
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,942
(insects chirping)

216
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,574
HEIDI:
<i>From the very beginning,</i>

217
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,826
<i>I knew that I either wanted</i>
<i>to team up</i>

218
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,997
<i>with Shawna or Jenna,</i>
<i>because what happens when</i>

219
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,498
<i>you're a cute little girl,</i>

220
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,333
<i>it's very easy</i>
<i>to be ganged up on.</i>

221
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,710
<i>So I thought, you know what?</i>

222
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,628
If you have all the little girls

223
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,838
against more of the bigger
girls, that it's like,

224
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,798
at least we have three
against somebody else.

225
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,676
I feel really bad, though,
that we're, like, getting...

226
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,011
You know, they're, like,

227
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,971
working their tail off,
and we're, like...

228
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:57,888
HEIDI: This is a game, though.
I mean, you've got

229
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,308
to play out the roles.
You've got to say,

230
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,434
"Okay, this is my next
opponent's move.

231
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,145
-This is how I'm going to
react." -It's like chess.

232
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,647
And if you can't do that, then
you really don't deserve to win.

233
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,523
I agree, I agree.

234
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,358
You have to be
a smart player, so...

235
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,860
SHAWNA:
<i>The older women might, uh,</i>

236
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,197
<i>try to kind of mount an</i>
<i>offensive against us,</i>

237
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,700
<i>trying to weed out the meek</i>
<i>or prissy or whatever.</i>

238
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,244
<i>So I figured,</i>

239
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,495
with my closeness to Deena,

240
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,205
that if we could swing
Deena's vote,

241
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,749
then it was, you know, game on,

242
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,584
that we could totally
hold our weight.

243
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,836
And if I rely on you,
and you guys rely on me,

244
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,254
and I will not break my word.

245
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,840
-I just need to know.
-Yes.

246
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,675
DEENA:
We're cleared.

247
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,552
<i>The other girls</i>
<i>and I talked very briefly,</i>

248
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:37,553
<i>and it just seemed</i>

249
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,847
<i>natural to me</i>
<i>that that would be</i>

250
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,183
<i>a great alliance.</i>
<i>We need four.</i>

251
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,186
<i>I have nothing</i>
<i>in common with them.</i>

252
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,437
I'm married with two children.

253
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,567
These people are in their 20s,
young, fit, and good-looking.

254
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,110
Let's go.

255
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,863
DEENA:<i> I chose to ally myself</i>
<i>with the younger women</i>

256
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,283
<i>because I think that I'm able</i>
<i>to talk and persuade</i>

257
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,370
<i>the younger crowd more</i>
<i>than I would, say, an older,</i>

258
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,872
<i>established,</i>
<i>been-around-the-block crowd.</i>

259
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,915
Yeah, to scoop
the fish out with.

260
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,834
It looks good.
So flaky.

261
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,253
SHAWNA:<i> If our alliance</i>
<i>sticks together,</i>

262
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,964
<i>Joanna and Jeannie--</i>
<i>they're in big trouble.</i>

263
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,758
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what their plan is, but</i>

264
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,928
right now,
all of us are too determined.

265
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,888
<i>Even if we disliked each other,</i>
<i>we'd still</i>

266
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,556
<i>stick by the alliance 'cause</i>

267
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,058
that's the strategy of it,
you know?

268
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,412
(screeches)

269
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,964
MATTHEW:
<i>Fishing is my forte.</i>

270
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,466
<i>I love fishing.</i>

271
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,509
<i>I've been fishing ever since</i>
<i>I was a little kid.</i>

272
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,803
Dude, I got a big fish.
Take this.

273
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,138
DAVE:
Yeah, you do.

274
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,975
MATTHEW:<i> I know that no one</i>
<i>can challenge my contributions</i>

275
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,645
<i>to life here at the camp.</i>

276
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,689
DAVE:
It's food time for Tam-ba-shmi.

277
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,149
First thing
we're going to do...

278
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,525
Kill him.

279
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,528
Get the hook out
of this baby. Yeah.

280
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,779
Okay.

281
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,947
-Nicely done.
-Nice!

282
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,782
-Hey, nice!
-Bon appetit, man.

283
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,284
Badonks, baby. Well done!

284
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,785
Hell, yeah!

285
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,288
This is a peacock bass, dude.
I read about them before.

286
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,333
<i>I'm genuinely reaching out</i>
<i>to various individuals.</i>

287
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,793
Well done, Matteo.

288
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,879
MATTHEW:
<i>While I was certainly</i>

289
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,674
<i>friendly with Ryan and Dan,</i>
<i>I am an individual.</i>

290
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,842
Go do it. Go do it.
We're hanging here.

291
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,011
MATTHEW:
<i>I think my actions</i>

292
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,846
<i>to turn things around</i>
<i>have begun to show</i>

293
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,724
some, um...

294
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,518
some fruit,
if I could say that.

295
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,855
Hey, guys, I've got good news
and bad news.

296
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:57,485
Bad news is I'm going to smell
like fish for a while.

297
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,570
Good news is,
I finally caught one.

298
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,322
All right!

299
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,699
-Is that cool or what?
-That is a fish!

300
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,826
What do you think, guys?
Come on, man.

301
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,119
(laughing):
All right! Yeah!

302
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,206
ALEX:<i> The tribe is feeling</i>
<i>really good. We caught our</i>

303
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,040
<i>-first real fish.</i>
-This is a beautiful fish.

304
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,334
ALEX:
<i>We feel like we got a</i>

305
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,668
strong team now,
a cohesive group

306
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,003
that-that can actually work

307
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,004
<i>together, and we really need</i>
<i>to carry</i>

308
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,132
<i>our momentum</i>
<i>to a reward challenge.</i>

309
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,050
-It's a big day, man.
-This is a big day.

310
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,761
-We're gonna keep
right on rolling. -Yup.

311
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,777
All right, if there's one thing

312
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,695
that I think probably everybody
here understands,

313
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,073
it is the value of fire.

314
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,908
The ability to make fire

315
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,537
and keep fire-- you need it
to boil water, to cook food.

316
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,454
Today's challenge, very simple.

317
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,624
Going to test your ability
to make fire.

318
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,584
Here's the challenge.

319
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,711
There are four ropes.
Each rope is attached

320
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,547
to a section of your banner.

321
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,716
You will each be given flint
and steel,

322
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,592
you'll have a magnifying glass.

323
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,137
Your goal-- working one rope
at a time,

324
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,057
build a fire big enough
to burn the rope,

325
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,600
releasing a section
of your banner.

326
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,645
First tribe to burn through all
four ropes,

327
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,273
revealing their tribe name,
wins reward.

328
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,442
-Want to know what you're
playing for? -Yes. -Yeah.

329
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,861
Fully-functioning refrigerator

330
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,989
will become a part
of your camp, and it is

331
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,200
stocked... with Coke.

332
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,453
-(whooping) -You've even got
some Vanilla Coke

333
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,248
back there, you got
some Cherry Coke back there.

334
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,457
Definitely worth playing for,
right?

335
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,292
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

336
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,254
Take your positions.
Wait for my go.

337
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,463
All right, Jaburu,

338
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,007
because you have one extra
member, sitting somebody out.

339
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,342
It's gonna be you, Jenna?

340
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,969
Have a seat on the bench next
to the ice-cold refrigerator.

341
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,849
For a great reward,
Survivors, ready?

342
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,851
Go!

343
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,019
BUTCH: Somebody get the pot.
You getting that, Roger?

344
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,022
I am. I'm getting it.
Don't worry about that.

345
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,158
Look at this, boys. Look at
this, boys. Look at this.

346
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,493
Look at this.
Don't need shavings.

347
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,037
Look at the shavings I got.
Look at the shavings I got.

-Oh, here, here.

349
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,415
Here's shavings.

350
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,003
JOANNA: I can't.
These-These logs are unstable.

351
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,839
And too many people are
on there shaking it.

352
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:33,182
I'm not getting anything out
of this magnifying glass, guys.

353
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,808
I got it. I got it.

354
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,143
-Come on, somebody help me.
-Okay.

355
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,311
-Put some stuff on it.
-(indistinct chatter)

356
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,189
Please put this-this fuzzy stuff
on it. The fuzzy stuff...

357
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,190
Not fuzzy stuff...

358
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,191
Jaburu has first fire.

359
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,485
Thank you, Lord.

360
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,111
You're so good to me.

361
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,200
The wind's going
to move it around a lot.

362
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,911
-Yeah, we...
-PROBST: Think about

363
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,371
how to block that wind.

364
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,373
Come on. We got something
right here. Get it in.

365
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,832

-Tambaqui got something going.

PROBST:
Tambaqui has first fire.

368

There you go, and then,
put it inside this little guy.

369
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,132
-Come on, baby.
-Light.

370
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,092
Jaburu getting close
on their first rope.

371

-(shouting) -Jaburu has their
first section completed.

372

Keep the shavings off.

Good job, guys. Good job.

377
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,402
Careful. Take some of the big
ones off when

378
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,237
-you're transporting them over.
-Don't let it get poked.

379
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,780
I need shavings.
I need shavings.

380
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,699

a big part in this.

383

All right, block the wind.
Stand there.

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,419

Okay.

388

Jaburu has section two down.

389
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,096
Somebody help me carry this.

390
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,641
Come on, baby. It's there,
it's there. It's almost there.

first section, moving on

-to section two. -Coming in,
you guys, coming in.

394
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,193
The men have made up a lot
of ground, women looking good.

395
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,450
That wind is... The wind is
coming down here.

396
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,325
Right in here.
Here it is. Here it is.

397
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,412
-Hairs on my leg, man.
-That's okay.

398
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,913
-Don't worry about it.
-Thanks, dude.

399
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,415
Hey, I'm burning up,
but don't worry about it.

400
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,833
Baptism by fire, guys.

401

-Oh, is that hot. -That's it.
-Oh. Oh! -Beautiful!

-(cheering) -PROBST: Tambaqui is
done with two.

Moving on to section three.

Let's get some little ones
for our next one.

406
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:32,801
-All right.
-Robbie?

00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,595
Rob's-Rob's on it. Rob's on it.

408
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,974
Any more little sticks
we can put on it, maybe?

409

JEANNE: Hey, if you guys
can make a teepee on this one,

410
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,395
-I got a bunch of this.
-You think, guys?

411
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,480
Tambaqui looking
at rope number three.

412
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,939
Get back some. I'm burning.

413
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,149
Burning. I'm burning.

414
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,150
Got it, you got it?

415
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,152
PROBST: Dave losing
all the hair on his legs.

416
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,945
Stay away from the rope,
though, Rob.

00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,614
Who needs Nair?

418
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,823
-(groaning)
-It's all right, guys.

I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

420
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,660
All right, it's on fire.
I'm going to go get sick, B.

Ooh, ooh.

PROBST:
Let's go, Jaburu.

425
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,377
Y'all want that Coke, we're
going to have to get together.

426
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,379
HEIDI: I know it. Just tell me
what to do, and I'll do it.

427
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,382
I'm trying to block the wind
and blow and...

428
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,676
Be patient, ladies.
Be patient.

429
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,427
-Come on, baby. It's gonna go.
-Just let it...

430
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,596
-Let it...
-You can't hold it.

431
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,806
You cannot...
You cannot hold it.

432
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:19,848
Why can I not hold it?

433
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,017
Because he said you can't.
We'll be in trouble.

434
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,020
PROBST: Tambaqui is blocking
the fire with their body.

435
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:27,397
-We got it now.
-Burning themselves up.

436
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,150
-Almost. Yeah!
-PROBST: Rope three is down.

437

-Go and scout for sticks.

438
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,031
You got to watch the...

439
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,324
-Block the wind.
-All right, block the wind.

440
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,534
Block the wind.
Over here.

441
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,451
Let it ride, fellas,
let it ride.

442
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,369
I'm not putting anything else
on there.

443
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,413
Nobody touch it.
Nobody touch it.

444
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,415
-Tear it off, fellas.
-Yeah, baby!

445
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,959
(shouting,
whooping and cheering)

446
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,044
-Go! Go! Go...
-Burn, baby!

-Oh. Oh.
-Good job, guys.

451
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,475
-Good job, guys.
-Good job. -Oh, yeah.

452
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,435
PROBST:
Jaburu,

453
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,604
you guys
can head back to camp.

454
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,898
One... two... three...

455
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,900
Oh, yeah, boys.

456
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,360
-Tambaqui.
-Put 'em up.

457
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,530
-Cheers, guys. Good job.
Good job. -Whoo!

458
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,034
-Mmm.
-Oh, wow.

459
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,760
Well, that sucked.

460
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,555
I think I need,
like, ten minutes

461
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,099
to like, emotionally and
physically re-center myself.

462
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,977
DEENA:<i> The group has probably</i>
<i>never been at its lowest.</i>

463
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,439

464
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,607
<i>I think that</i>

465
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,483
some people are coping better
than others.

466
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,402
And some, as a result
of the reward challenge,

467
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,447
just... went downhill quickly.

468
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,074
Like, I don't have any
motivation to go anywhere.

469
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,452
My body is just,
like, sucking energy

470
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,455
from my left toe.
It's just...

471
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,916
(voice breaking):
I am so tired.

472
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,045
And I feel like--
you know, it sucks, and... Oh!

473
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,130
DEENA: You allowed yourself
to get dehydrated.

474
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:18,133
So if you allow yourself
to get rehydrated...

475
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,093
-I'm just saying, that, like...
-Well, we... well, we...

476
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,470
I need to let you guys
know where I am,

477
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,139
'cause I am just breaking
hour by hour.

478
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:26,475
And after we lost that Coke,
it took everything

479
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,477
in my entire brain
to not make my body just want

480
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,312
to sit on the sand and be, like,

481
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,149
I have
to take a three-hour break.

482
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,525
This is ridiculous.

483
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,320
I feel like I'm a blubbering
idiot, you know. It's just...

484
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,489
HEIDI:<i> This is a crucial part</i>
<i>of the game right now.</i>

485
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,368
<i>To get ahead of the other</i>
<i>people on our tribe.</i>

486
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,829
It's so hard because
you can't be that sympathetic,

487
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,413
because you're sitting here
saying,

488
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,832
"Shawna, we need you.

489
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,542
Do you not understand?
We need you."

490
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,713
I feel like I've fallen into
some crappy-ass depression.

491
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,175
And I can't... and the only way
out of it is to get out.

492
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,345
I don't see myself lasting
for 30 more days.

493
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,554
Like, it's not happening
right now.

494
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,349
Shut up.

495
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,476
<i>Drink your water</i>

496
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:15,023
<i>Quit acting like this is the</i>
<i>worst day of your entire life.</i>

497
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,358
I want to laugh
so badly right now,

498
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,027
and there is
nothing that I think

499
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,487
is any bit funny about this.

500
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,198
DEENA:<i> I don't want you</i>

502
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:31,081
I'm just totally
eff-ing sick of this.

00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,332
DEENA:
<i>What do I do?</i>

504
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,334
<i>Do I say,</i>
<i>"Shawna, you're right.</i>

505
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,878
<i>I need to protect you,</i>
<i>and you should go home."</i>

506
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,505
<i>Or do I say,</i>
<i>"Hey, we're in it for us;</i>

507
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,550
<i>we're not in it for somebody</i>
<i>else that broke the alliance"?</i>

508
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,802
Are you at this point

509
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,470
right this very moment
where you say, "I want out,

510
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,181
-I want out"? -JENNA: If we were
going tonight.

511
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:48,974
If we were going tonight,

512
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:53,228
I would be
very tempted to get out.

513
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,855
Very tempted, you know.

514
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,189
-DEENA: So?
-So in that case,

515
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,733
yeah, I would want it.
I mean...

516
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,651
JENNA: Yeah, I don't know
that I could do it.

517
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,323
(sniffles)

518
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,412
ALEX: This has been
a pretty good day so far.

519
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,413
Good job.

520
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,581
I'll get the fire going.

521
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,624
Anybody know
how to start a fire?

522
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,084
(laughter)

523
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,586
DAVE:
<i>The reward challenge was</i>

524
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,047
<i>a turning point</i>
<i>for the Tambaqui tribe.</i>

525
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,883
We ended a losing streak.

526
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,094
<i>It was a huge morale booster,</i>
<i>and it also really showed</i>

527
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,596
<i>that-that we do have it as</i>
<i>a tribe, we have it together,</i>

528
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,098
<i>and we still had</i>
<i>enough confidence to come</i>

529
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,726
from behind and win
and-and get the reward.

530
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,436
I was expecting
a refrigerator delivery today.

531
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,604
It's already here.

532
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,440
-Look at that.
-That is service!

533
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,233
The fridge is in.

534
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,985
Whoa!

535
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,278
Open that bad boy.

536
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,489
And look at that.

537
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,656
-Looky, looky.
-Yeah, cold.

538
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,575
-How many did we get?
-Eight, ten,

539
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,577
12, 14, 16, right?

540
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,246
18, 20, 22.

541
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,456
Is there one there?

542
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,624
-Yeah, 23.
-Yes, I see 23.

543
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,625
-You're right.
-23.

544
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,460
Good. Well, let's keep 'em cold.

545
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,296
-39 grams of carbs.
-Carbohydrates.

546
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,507
Sugar's another 39 grams.

547
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,427
No protein in it, and no fat.

548
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,304
Who'd have thought that-that
we'd all be enthralled

549
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,806
with the reading of a soda can?

550
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,599
ROB: We actually have
something to read now

551
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,683
-when we go to the bathroom.
-(laughter)

552
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,520
You guys ready to try this?

553
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,646
-Yeah. -Yay!
-All right.

554
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,648
The first sip's
always the best, too.

555
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,191
-Bring that bad boy over here.
-Yeah.

556
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,776
-Dig in.
-Go to, guys.

557
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,693
It's gonna be hot.

558
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,487
-Oh, that is delicious.
-Mm-hmm.

559
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,656
-Wow.
-Oh, wow.

560
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,657
-A real mouthful.
-I ate it.

561
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,159
-Mm-mm!
-Wow.

562
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,369
-Is that good or what?
-Mm!

563
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,329
That is absolutely delicious.

564
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,539
Guys, the eyeballs shouldn't
go to waste, either.

565
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,875
I'm hungry,
but I'm not that man.

566
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,297
-(laughter): No...
-Nice!

567
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,842
-That was nasty.
-Whoo-ee!

568
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,845
There's no "I" in "team,"
but there's one in Matt's mouth.

569
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,972
(laughter)

570
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,849
DAVE:<i> Today will forever</i>
<i>be in my mind</i>

571
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,393
<i>as the perfect</i> Survivor<i> day.</i>

572
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,477
Everything flowed perfectly.

573
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:57,769
Everything flowed our way.

574
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,770
(burps)

575
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,611
ROB:
I know lots of them

576
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,530
from-from, uh, doing karaoke
in the basement.

577
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:15,036
Rob is the most enthusiastic,
uh, kid I've seen.

578
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,329
Not bad. That was not bad.

579
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,539
-Very good.
-Well done. -(applause)

580
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,875
<i>But I have to be honest,</i>
<i>he really is pathetic.</i>

581
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,751
<i>I mean, to be 24 years old,</i>

582
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,795
<i>singing karaoke</i>
<i>in your basement.</i>

583
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,797
DAVE: Man, that's hard
to follow up right there.

584
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,613
Oh, look at that, a piranha.

585
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,614
Oh, wow.

586
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,240
That is some
nasty-looking stuff.

587
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,575
Wow.

588
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,160
Let's go.

589
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,377
Rise and shine.

590
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,879
You guys want to stay in bed
while we read it?

591
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,923
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

592
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,467
HEIDI:
"Rise and shine before the sun.

593
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,887
"It'll be 4:30 a.m.
for everyone.

594
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,723
"Get in your canoe,
you've fishing to do.

595
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,768
Fail and your tribe
could be done."

596
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,770
We are going to fish!

597
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,731
Oh, we'll kick butt on this one.

598
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,234
-Crazy.
-(makes chewing noises)

599
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,709
PROBST:
Nice and tight right in here.

600
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,799
Welcome.

601
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,260
Come on out
and have a spot on your mat.

602
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,851
First things first.

603
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,937
Shawna, gotta take it back.

604
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,939
Immunity back up for grabs.

605
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,148
All right.

606
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,110
At our reward challenge,
we tested your ability

607
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:13,363
to make fire-- one of the key
elements, right, for survival.

608
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,449
Today, we're gonna test
another element of survival:

609
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,201
your ability to catch fish.

610
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,328
Each tribe's gonna have one hour

611
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,997
to catch as many fish
as they can.

612
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,998
Here's your toolkit.

613
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,999
You'll each have a pole,

614
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,334
plenty of bait,

615
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,171
have a knife, pliers and hooks.

616
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,675
Now, there are a lot of fish
out there, but the most common

617
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,137
and the most likely to bite you
is the piranha.

618
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,848
This is a small piranha.

619
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,182
They have a sharp bite,

620
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,851
and when they start biting,
it's very vicious.

621
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,187
This is another piranha
we caught this morning.

622
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,481
A little larger.
You can see the teeth.

623
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,693
These guys will take your finger
off, no question about it.

624
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,154
I just want you guys
to not get careless.

625
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:54,946
Okay.

626
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,365
So, each tribe
will have an hour.

627
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,743
We picked two spots
50 yards apart, where

628
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,246
<i>there are highly-concentrated</i>
<i>amounts of piranha.</i>

629
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:08,001
At the end of one hour, whoever
has the most fish by weight

630
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,254
wins immunity and wins
all the fish they caught.

631
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,923
(murmuring, cheering)

632
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,051
Jaburu, since you have
one extra member,

633
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,261
you've chosen Shawna to sit out.

634
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,347
Get your toolkits together,
get in your boat.

635
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,306
We'll head out.

636
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,436
Here we go, guys, for immunity.

637
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,395
Survivors ready?

638
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,189
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

639
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,565
Go!

640
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,365
Tambaqui off to a good start.

641
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:38,907
Hey, I caught a fish.

642
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,908
(chuckles):
Hey.

643
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,909
Guys, help; it's a piranha.

644
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,371
PROBST:
Jaburu has their first fish.

645
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,915
I'm just going to step on it
while someone gets it.

646
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,875
Yeah, this one, too.

647
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,293
We need the pliers.

648
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,424
DAVE:
Got one.

649
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,092
Do you jerk it hard?

650
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,802
Yeah, pull it straight up.

651
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,304
Guys, first, uh, nibble,
you just got to grab it.

652
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,764
That's it, baby doll.
See how I did that?

653
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,765
He started to run with it.

654
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,768
Good job.

655
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,310
Small, but it counts.

656
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,937
Hey, it's weight, boys.

657
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,313
Hey, can you give me
a hand here?

658
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,481
-I can't get this hook out.
-Yeah.

659
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,948
PROBST: Heidi, tell me
about your strategy.

660
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,950
What's the best way
to catch a piranha?

661
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:26,079
Cutting up other little piranha
and trying to go off

662
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,789
the end of the boat
where it's deeper,

663
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,124
and hopefully,
we'll get some bigger ones.

664
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:29,999
PROBST: So you're risking
a little weight

665
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,335
in hope of catching
something bigger.

666
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,629
-How's it going, Joanna?
-It's going.

667
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,922
It's just little fish and
trying to catch a bigger one.

668
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,633
You're at 30 minutes, guys.

669
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,301
You see, Jeff, I think
the big thing that we need

670
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,431
to talk about is the dynamic
combination of Roger and myself.

671
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,975
What is exactly that
combination, rocket scientist?

672
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:51,104
In terms of rocket science,
as soon as, uh, Roger

673
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:55,150
gets the, uh, the fish in
the boat, I apply a large force

674
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,860
with the bottom of my heel.

675
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,027
We switch poles,
I take off, rebait,

676
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,905
pass it back to Roger,
and away we go again.

677
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,115
Do you think there's any chance

678
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,825
Jaburu is outfishing you
right now?

679
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,993
-There's always that chance.
-There's always that chance.

680
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,537
You take nothing
for granted out here.

681
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,083
If someone doesn't-- Whoa!

682
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,002
No, no!

683
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,545
Oh, damn you!

684
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,922
These are some little,
nasty, little fish.

685
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,052
Catch it, catch it.

686
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,181
Two minutes remaining!

687
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,725
Looks like Jaburu
may have caught up.

688
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,854
Oh, yeah.

689
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,688
How you doing, Matteo?

690
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:34,105
Doing well, man.

691
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,733
There we go.

692
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,192
Good job, dude.

693
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,861
I got one, baby.

694
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,029
It's in the boat.
It's in the boat.

695
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,031
PROBST:
One minute left!

696
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,703
Oh.

697
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,205
Son of a biscuit.

698
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,539
PROBST:
30 seconds!

699
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,874
30 seconds.

700
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,042
PROBST:
15 seconds!

701
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,503
Nice.

702
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,670
Oh, yeah.

703
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,922
Give it to me.

704
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,007
PROBST:
Five, four...

705
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,676
-Get 'em in there, guys.
-Done. -...three, two, one.

706
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,928
That's it!

707
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,055
All poles out of the water.

708
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,389
No more fishing.

709
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,767
Put it in your bucket
and head back to the dock.

710
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,690
Okay.

711
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,734
The tribe who's caught
the most fish,

712
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:22,278
you're heading back to camp,
probably have a nice barbecue.

713
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,781
For the losing tribe, you're
heading to Tribal Council,

714
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,075
where another person will be
voted out of the Amazon.

715
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,076
Jaburu, bring up your fish,

716
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,870
put 'em on your side
of the scale.

717
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,372
(thunder rumbling)

718
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,630
Tambaqui.

719
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:57,272
For immunity
and all the fish you caught.

720
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,148
Tambaqui, congratulations.

721
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,149
Yeah!

722
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,193
-ROB: Great job, guys.
-ALEX: Good job, guys.

723
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,987
DAVE:
Well done.

724
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,613
Safe in the Amazon
three more days.

725
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,782
You got a lot of fish and
hopefully some Coke still left.

726
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:08,825
Should be a nice afternoon.

727
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,452
Sadly, Jaburu,
not as fun for you.

728
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,120
I'll see you guys
at Tribal Council.

729
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,622
Somebody else is going home.

730
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,165
You can head back to camp.

731
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,149
Oh, I smell like garbage.

732
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,526
(quiet chatter)

733
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,153
Now you're getting into bed?

734
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,654
(Shawna moans)

735
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,324
You all right?

736
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,116
Mm-hmm. I'm fine.

737
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,160
Just got lightheaded.

738
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,203
SHAWNA:
<i>Going to Tribal Council,</i>

739
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,164
<i>I pretty much</i>
<i>could go either way.</i>

740
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,833
<i>I just feel relieved</i>

741
00:31:58,916 --> 00:31:59,792
that it could be me.

742
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,419
I know that sounds so terrible.

743
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,088
I'm sure I'm probably
the first Survivor to say that.

744
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:12,347
JEANNE:
<i>I will be voting off Shawna.</i>

745
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,806
<i>She's been weak, and, uh,</i>

746
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,184
<i>we need all the strength</i>
<i>we can get.</i>

747
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,977
It's going to be sad
to see her go,

748
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,855
but she really needs
to get her health back.

749
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,696
SHAWNA:<i> I think Jeanne</i>
<i>and Joanna are voting for me.</i>

750
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,240
<i>I know Christy was thinking</i>
<i>about voting for me, also.</i>

751
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,243
<i>I'm on the fence</i>
<i>about who I'm voting for.</i>

752
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,870
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>I've kind of been</i>

753
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,538
<i>bumped from the alliance</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

754
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,708
<i>I don't make many decisions</i>
<i>with them anymore, so...</i>

755
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,503
I may make one on my own.

756
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,385
DEENA:
<i>I... I feel a tremendous amount</i>

757
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,220
<i>of compassion for her, I do.</i>

758
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,805
I feel really bad,
but at the same time,

759
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,764
you have an agreement.

760
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,265
Don't be a crying, whiny baby.

761
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,475
Yeah.

762
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,227
-So, you know...
-But she's--

763
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,228
there's a possibility
of screwing us because...

764
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,188
And I don't want to get screwed
to help her out.

765
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,732
No, I don't.

766
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,693
DEENA:<i> I'm not going to feel</i>
<i>really good inside</i>

767
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,403
<i>about keeping Shawna on,</i>

768
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,071
but it's kind of
a "Hey, guess what?

769
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,407
"You're not in charge here.

770
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,742
<i>"It's about the core alliance.</i>

771
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,912
<i>And suck it up, baby, 'cause</i>
<i>you're along for the ride."</i>

772
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,748
<i>Joanna is clearly</i>
<i>the most physical person</i>

773
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,791
<i>that we have on this team.</i>

774
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,918
<i>She has too much power,</i>
<i>too much force.</i>

775
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,795
I need to get her off early.

776
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,589
We could have had the five
before-- us four and Christy.

777
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,425
-Right. -And that would have
been a for-sure thing.

778
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,384
JENNA: And the thing is, is
once you break down mentally--

779
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,553
you're to the point
where you tell yourself

780
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,303
you're through
and you've had it--

781
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,723
then everything else goes kaput.

782
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,307
I mean, she's falling down when
she gets up all of a sudden.

783
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,810
DEENA:
How do you feel?

784
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,186
-About the situation?
-Yes.

785
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,148
It's a bummer
that she feels that way.

786
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,651
JENNA:<i> Christy is</i>
<i>kind of like our-our wild card.</i>

787
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,236
<i>It's important for me</i>
<i>and Deena and Heidi</i>

788
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,072
<i>to get Christy</i>
<i>to vote on our side</i>

789
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,783
because Shawna wants out,
and if we let her out now,

790
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,201
there's a possibility
of... of us

791
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,287
<i>not being able</i>
<i>to have the majority.</i>

792
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,791
I know how I feel,
and if Shawna wants to go first,

793
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,376
are we putting her first
before Joanna?

794
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,461
-No.
-No.

795
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,462
You're going to put
Joanna first?

796
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,963
DEENA:
Yes.

797
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,006
So she's not here.

798
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:10,673
HEIDI:
Bye. Bye.

799
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,134
So basically she is chopped.

800
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,136
By doing that, you're securing
your position as well.

801
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:20,099
CHRISTY:<i> I am like</i>
<i>a little free bird over here.</i>

802
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,770
<i>They want me to keep Shawna in</i>
<i>the game and we take out Joanna</i>

803
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,938
<i>because she gets on</i>
<i>everybody's nerves.</i>

804
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:26,981
<i>Joanna, however,</i>

805
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,484
does get the big, monstrous fish

806
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,653
and feeds us and really works
and does her job.

807
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,988
But...

808
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,992
<i>at the same time, Shawna--</i>
<i>she really wants to get out.</i>

809
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,287
And it's just like
we're making her trapped.

810
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,206
So it's just, it's...

811
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,248
I don't know.

812
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,886
Welcome back to Tribal Council.

813
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,680
Not a place you want to be,
I know.

814
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,099
Tough last three days
for you guys.

815
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,684
A long winning streak, really,

816
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,686
and then two challenges
in a row,

817
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,063
both based on survival,
both losses.

818
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,898
Heidi, what was the reaction
of the group?

819
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,276
I think we were actually
all pretty surprised.

820
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,903
I mean, we feel like we've got
our act together, and...

821
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,073
we felt like the reward
challenge was a loss,

822
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,409
but we were so ready
to come in and kick some butt,

823
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,037
so, I mean, we really were
surprised that we lost.

824
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,080
PROBST:
Last time you guys were here,

825
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:08,749
you were all in agreement,
you needed a leader.

826
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,750
What happened
on the leadership front?

827
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,588
We just threw out ideas
of what needs to go on,

828
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,922
who might be a good leader,

829
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,466
and I think that
Jeanne elected Deena

830
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,053
to be the leader,
and we all agreed

831
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,597
that that was a good idea.

832
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,058
PROBST: Okay, Jeanne, so you
elect Deena as the leader.

833
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,476
Is there an even distribution
of work now?

834
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,105
Um, yeah, there's an even
distribution of work.

835
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,190
How is that decided?

836
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,443
Is it all on Deena, or
do you guys now have a routine?

837
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,485
Basically, we're following
a routine.

838
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,614
Whatever we're good at,
that's where we go.

839
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,240
What are you good at?

840
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,617
Bringing home the food.

841
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,327
Are there roles that
certain people are hunting now

842
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,246
and other people are maybe
preparing the food?

843
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,164
JEANNE:
Yeah.

844
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,291
Joanna and I and Christy
have been hunting,

845
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,418
and, uh, we come back
and these guys prepare the food.

846
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,339
Joanna, you're definitely
a provider in this group.

847
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,759
You're also a mother in real
life, but I don't necessarily

848
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,636
see you taking on
a mother role out here.

849
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,804
No, I've kind of left that
to Deena and Jeanne.

850
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,140
I think they do it bet...
a little better than I do.

851
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:08,142
I try to keep the spirituality

852
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:09,769
and the emotional
stability going,

853
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:13,272
so I do a lot of singing
and saying quotes

854
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,065
and doing things like that.

855
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,316
I don't have daughters.
(chuckles)

856
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,443
I have a boy
and he's-he's very boyish,

857
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,320
and I'm kind of boyish,
and so I let them do that.

858
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,196
They-They're good at it.

859
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,948
Deena, when you get up
in the morning,

860
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,950
do you assess your tribe?

861
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:24,325
Is that part of
your responsibility?

862
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,326
Yes.

863
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,704
I know who's not doing so well

864
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,498
and who is doing
better than ever.

865
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,874
Give me an example of both.

866
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,875
Who's doing better than ever?

867
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,876
Christy.

868
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,628
Christy doesn't complain.

869
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,673
Christy just goes forward; she's
right there Johnny-on-the-spot.

870
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,967
Uh, Shawna's not doing well.

871
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,010
What about that concerns you?

872
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,138
Well, obviously we want
to beat the boys.

873
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,682
We don't want
to come here again.

874
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,850
And so we need to have
the physical strength

875
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,394
to get us to go on.

876
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,478
So that's what concerns me.

877
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,690
Can she contribute
as much as the other members?

878
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,316
Not right now.

879
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,360
All right, it is time to vote.

880
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,737
Heidi, you're first.

881
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:20,214
Joanna, I'm picking you tonight
because you are

882
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,049
a very, very strong competitor,

883
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,551
and I have an alliance
with other people,

884
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,387
and that's why I'm picking you.

885
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,763
So good luck.

886
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,776
Shawna, you're a great kid.

887
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,569
You need some TLC and get

888
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,321
yourself back into good health.

889
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,489
I'll miss you.

890
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,303
Only because you asked me to.

891
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,403
You're an incredibly
strong woman both physically,

892
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,572
spiritually, mentally,

893
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,575
but therefore you're also
my biggest competition.

894
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,332
I'll go tally the votes.

895
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,300
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

896
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,843
The person voted out
will be asked to leave

897
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:48,636
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

898
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,138
I'll read the votes.

899
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,145
First vote:

900
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,189
Joanna.

901
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,027
Shawna.

902
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,573
Joanna. Two votes-- Joanna.

903
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,993
Shawna.

904
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:18,374
Two votes-- Joanna,
two votes-- Shawna.

905
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,087
Joanna.

906
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,339
That's three votes-- Joanna,
two votes-- Shawna.

907
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,719
Joanna.

908
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,680
That's four, and that's enough.

909
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,014
The last vote
will remain a mystery.

910
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,975
Need to bring me your torch.

911
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,819
Joanna, the tribe has spoken.

912
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:50,823
It's time for you to go.

913
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:51,866
(whispers):
Thank you.

914
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:05,129
Well, this tribe seems to have
it all together: strong leader,

915
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,714
things going well back at camp,

916
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,049
but tonight's vote
says otherwise.

917
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,219
Just another reminder: don't get
too comfortable in this game,

918
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,972
because you never know
what's coming next.

919
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,183
You can head back to camp.
Good night.

920
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,866
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

921
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,079

922

<i>Shawna remains trapped</i>

923
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,918
I'm at the lowest of my low,
and no one is respecting

924
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,794
the fact
that I am falling apart.

925
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,087
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
