1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:01,751
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:02,377
SURVIVOR.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,381
ON DAY 17 UPOLU AND THE

4
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,090
SAVAII TRIBE WERE DEAD EVEN.

5
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,717
SIX EACH.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,342
UPOLU WINS.

7
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:13,555
SAVAII LOSES THE CHALLENGE

8
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,764
AND BLAMES COCHRAN.

9
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,266
WITH THE MERGE LOONLING OZZY

10
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:16,850
PROPOSES A RISKY PLAN.

11
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,143
I WOULD BE WILLING TO

12
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,895
SACRIFICE MYSELF, GO TO

13
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,604
REDEMPTION.

14
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,480
BEAT KRISTINE AND GET BACK IN

15
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,148
THE GAME AND GIVE OUR TRIBE AN

16
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,691
EDGE.

17
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,775
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

18
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,486
I HAD A DREAM AND I SAW MY

19
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,571
CHANCE AT MY OWN REDEMPTION.

20
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,449
OZZY ALSO WANTED COCHRAN TO

21
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,408
BE A DOUBLE AGENT.

22
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,577
I WILL MAKE UP A STORY,

23
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,080
COCHRAN IS THE SMART WEASEL, HE

24
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,332
VOTE HIM OUT AND WHIPS OUT THE

25
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,125
IDOL, GOOD-BYE, OZZY.

26
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,171
AND GAVE OZZY HIS IMMUNITY

27
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:46,880
IDOL.

28
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,924
IN THE END, SAVAII WENT ALONG

29
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,592
WITH THE PLAN.

30
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,301
OZZY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

31
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,261
NOW THE QUESTIONS ARE, CAN

32
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,972
OZZY WIN AT REDEMPTION ISLAND?

33
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,599
I AM OUT OF HERE?

34
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,934
WILL THERE BE A MERGE AND

35
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,021
CAN COCHRAN BE A MASTER SPY?

36
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,073
THE WEIRDEST MERGE IN SURVIVOR
HISTORY.

37
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,451
WHAT WHAT A DIFFERENCE THE

38
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,035
DAY MAKES.

39
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,454
A DAY AGO I THOUGHT I WAS

40
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,789
GOING TO REDEMPTION ISLAND,

41
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,874
WHERE I WOULD HUMILIATE MYSELF

42
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,500
AND GO HOME.

43
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,668
OZZY CAME FROM THE HEAVENS

44
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,504
AND GAVE THIS MIRACULOUS PLAN

45
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,048
WHERE HE WOULD SACRIFICE HIMSELF

46
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,883
ON THE BASIS OF THE TRIBE, BASED

47
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:32,592
ON THE MERGE THAT WILL TAKE

48
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:36,304
PLACE AND THE GAMBLE YOUR YOU

49
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,639
PROVE YOURSELF IN AN EXTREMELY

50
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,057
STRONG PLAYER AT REDEMPTION

51
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,766
ISLAND.

52
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,475
IF EVERYTHING CONNECTS IN THE

53
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,684
WAY WE HOPE IT WILL THIS IS

54
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,019
GOING TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS

55
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,229
ONE OF THE SINGLE BIGGEST AND

56
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,897
GREATEST MOVES IN SURVIVOR

57
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,486
HISTORY.

58
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,987
WHAT IS OUR BEST OPTION TO

59
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,324
STAY IN THE GAME?

60
00:01:56,407 --> 00:02:00,161
I WAS WILLING TO GO.

61
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,871
YOU CAN EASILY SAY YOU ARE

62
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,081
WILLING TO GO, BUT TO ACTUALLY

63
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,042
DO IT, STEP UP AND TAKE CONTROL,

64
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,503
THAT IS DIFFERENT.

65
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,714
THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE, I

66
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,049
DON'T LIVE IT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

67
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:14,717
JUST STEP UP AND PROVE TO THE

68
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,177
WORLD WHAT YOU CAN DO.

69
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,888
WHAT CAN I DO IN TERMS OF OUR

70
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,472
PLAN IS.

71
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,724
I PRESUME IF I GO TO THE

72
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,726
OTHER SIDE THEY WILL ASK WHAT

73
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,186
BOND EXISTS BETWEEN ALL OF YOU.

74
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,105
YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT, MAN.

75
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,064
YOU JUST HAVE TO --

76
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,399
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

77
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,400
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SAY.

78
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,861
ANOTHER BIG PART OF THE PLAN

79
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,071
IS THAT I BECOME THE SORT OF

80
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,531
DOUBLE AGENT WHO WILL BE ABLE TO

81
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:41,536
FIGURE OUT WHO THE ZERO PO

82
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,787
THROUGH TRIBE PLANS TO VOTE OUT

83
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,205
IN THE EVENT OF A MERGE.

84
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,748
EVERYBODY IN THIS GAME IS

85
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,876
CAPABLE OF BEING A DOUBLE AGENT,

86
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,710
IF ANYBODY, IT IS ME.

87
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,713
I HAVE ALREADY BEEN

88
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,589
PRETENDING LIKE I LIKE THE

89
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,799
PEOPLE IN MY TRIBE AN 18-DAY, I

90
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,593
THINK I DESERVE AN ACADEMY AWARD

91
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,302
FOR THAT PERFORMANCE.

92
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,096
I WILL PLAY WHATEVER PART I

93
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,307
NEED TO PLAY.

94
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,767
I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT THAT

95
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,435
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

96
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,436
NO.

97
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,564
THAT IS SWEET.

98
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,273
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

99
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,736
RIGHT NOW, MY PHILOSOPHY, TO

100
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,571
TAKE FROM AL PACINO.

101
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,323
FIRST YOU GET THE EGO MANIA

102
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,450
PLAYER VOTED OUT AND THEN YOU

103
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,410
GET HIS IDOL AND THEN YOU GET

104
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:26,539
THE MILLION DOLLARS.

105
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,165
Captioning brought to you by

106
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:31,920
Survivor Productions, CBS,

107
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,270
HELLO, HELLO.

108
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,813
DID I WAKE YOU UP?

109
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,481
WHO IS IT?

110
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,775
THIS IS OZZY.

111
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,610
HI.

112
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,155
NICE TO MEET YOU.

113
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,115
UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES.

114
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,407
WHAT HAPPENED?

115
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,662
OH, MAN.

116
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,121
IDOL.

117
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:07,413
WHAT?

118
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:07,830
YEAH.

119
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,832
WHO HAD IT?

120
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,169
GUESS.

121
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,420
COCHRAN.

122
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,004
YES.

123
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:15,964
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

124
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,800
WELL, FROM LISTENING TO

125
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:19,050
PEOPLE.

126
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:19,550
OH!

127
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,511
THE LITTLE WEASEL.

128
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,138
I CAME INTO REDEMPTION AND I

129
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:24,806
PUT ON MY ACTOR SUIT.

130
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,517
AND ALL VOTED COCHRAN AND HE

131
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,184
PULLED OUT THE IDOL.

132
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,560
AND HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY?

133
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,144
NO.

134
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:30,687
I THINK SHE BOUGHT IT.

135
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,690
I THINK THAT SHE TOOK IT

136
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,526
HOOK, LINE AND SINKER.

137
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,404
I GET TAKEN OUT, I DIDN'T

138
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,532
PLAY THE IDOL THIS TIME AND --

139
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,159
LIKE WHAT IS IT WITH YOU

140
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,870
LAWYERS? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

141
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,372
THIS IS PART OF THE PLAN.

142
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,582
FIRST STEP IS GETTING MYSELF

143
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,333
VOTED OUT.

144
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,669
THE SECOND STEP, GETTING HER TO

145
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,213
BELIEVE THAT, THIRD STEP,

146
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,423
BEATING HER AND GIVING THE OTHER

147
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,174
TRIBE FALSE INFORMATION.

148
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,176
THE MOVE IS PROBABLY EITHER

149
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,720
THE STUPIDEST THING I COULD HAVE

150
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,222
DONE OR THE CRAZIEST, BALLSIEST

151
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,557
THING I PROBABLY COULD EVER HAVE

152
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:17,608
THOUGHT OF DOING.

153
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:28,703
THOUGHT OF DOING.

154
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,038
Jeff: NOW BRING IN THE

155
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,623
COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S DUAL.

156
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,042
KRISTINE, THE BATTLE AGAINST

157
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:34,709
OZZY.

158
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,544
VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL

159
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:46,262
COUNCIL.

160
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,889
Jeff: WELCOME TO REDEMPTION

161
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:48,598
ISLAND ARENA, BOTH TRIBES ARE

162
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,602
HERE TO WITNESS TODAY'S DUAL.

163
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,562
OZZY, ARE YOU SURPRISED TO FIND

164
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,898
YOURSELF ON REDEMPTION ISLAND?

165
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,441
I MEAN, I GAVE PRETTY MUCH

166
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,235
EVERYTHING TO MY TRIBE, AND THEN

167
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,945
WE LOSE ONE CHALLENGE BECAUSE

168
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,447
SOMEBODY CAN'T OPERATE A CLIP,

169
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,908
AND THAT ENDS UP BEING THE

170
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,410
PERSON THAT SENDS ME HERE.

171
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,454
PLAYS THE IDOL, YOU DON'T EVEN

172
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,539
-- I KNOW SOMEONE ELSE PROBABLY

173
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,124
KNEW THAT YOU HAD IT, AS FAR AS

174
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,251
I AM CONCERNED, TRIBE

175
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,420
BOUNDARIES, I MEAN, AT THE

176
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,797
MERGE, THEY DON'T EXIST ANYMORE,

177
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,672
IT IS ALL ONE FOR ONE AND

178
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,133
WHOEVER STICKS TOGETHER FROM

179
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:24,675
THIS POINT ON MAKES IT THE

180
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,011
FURTHEST IN THE GAME.

181
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:27,678
BUT I THRIVE UNDER THE PRESSURE

182
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,723
TO COME BACK IN THE GAME FOR

183
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,601
REVENGE, BASICALLY.

184
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,477
ALL RIGHT.

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,395
ARE YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO

186
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:36,687
TODAY'S DUAL?

187
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,396
YEAH.

188
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,482
FOR TODAY'S DUAL YOU WILL USE

189
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,776
STICKS AND ROPES TO MAKE A LONG

190
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,318
POLE.

191
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,653
YOU WILL USE THE POLE TO

192
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,947
RETRIEVE THREE KEYS.

193
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,616
THE THREE KEYS OPEN THREE LOCKS.

194
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,743
THE FIRST PERSON TO SET THROUGH

195
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,454
THEIR DOOR WINS THIS DUAL.

196
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,998
THE LOSER IS OUT OF THE GAUGE

197
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:56,791
FOR GOOD.

198
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,501
THERE IS ONE SIGNIFICANT

199
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,336
DIFFERENCE WITH TODAY'S DUAL.

200
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,004
THE WINNER OF THIS DUAL DOES NOT

201
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,840
GO BACK TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

202
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,468
THEY COME BACK INTO THE GAME.

203
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:11,848
HUGE SEX, ONE SHOT.

204
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,308
THIS IS IT.

205
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:22,984
PICK YOUR SPOTS.

206
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:23,734
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

207
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,027
ONE OF YOU WILL GET BACK IN THIS

208
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,988
GAME AND ONE OF YOU IS GOING

209
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:27,363
HOME.

210
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,739
HERE WE GO.

211
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,324
SURVIVORS, READY.

212
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,453
GO.

213
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,539
YOUR FIRST GOAL IS TO BUILD

214
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,332
THAT POLE.

215
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,876
IT NEEDS TO BE LONG ENOUGH AND

216
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,546
STRONG ENOUGH TO REACH THE KEYS.

217
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,341
IF YOU PANIC AND MAKE A WEAK

218
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,050
ONE, IT WILL FALL APART AS SOON

219
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,763
AS YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE GATE.

220
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,348
KRISTINE IS GETTING MORE OUT OF

221
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,726
HER STICK, IT MAY TAKE FEWER

222
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,436
STICKS FOR KRISTINE.

223
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,689
TWO VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES.

224
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,108
KRISTINE GOING TO GIVE ATE

225
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:04,775
GO.

226
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,693
HOPING THAT HER POLE WILL BE

227
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,070
LONG ENOUGH AND STRONG ENOUGH TO

228
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:15,203
REACH A KEY.

229
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,372
KRISTINE'S POLE IS JUST LONG

230
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:18,915
ENOUGH.

231
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,708
BUT NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

232
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,919
OZZY IS GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.

233
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,794
THIS IS WHERE THE STRATEGY OF

234
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,924
HOW YOU TIE YOUR STICKS TOGETHER

235
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,799
WILL PAY OFF OR WORK AGAINST

236
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,427
YOU.

237
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:37,934
KRISTINE VERY CLOSE.

238
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,269
KRISTINE'S POLE IS JUST SHORT.

239
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,480
OZZY, HE HAS THE POLE ON HIS KEY

240
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,189
RING, IS IT STRONG MUST HAVE TO

241
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,942
GET IT ALL THE WAY BACK? IT IS

242
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:52,615
HANGING ON BY THE EDGE OF THE

243
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,032
POLE.

244
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:58,663
AND IT DROPS.

245
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,289
KRISTINE'S POLE IS STARTING TO

246
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,916
FALL APART, SHE HAS TO TAKE IT

247
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,752
BACK FOR MORE REPAIRS.

248
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,796
OZZY ALMOST THERE.

249
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:13,010
CAN HE HOOK IT? AND HE DOES.

250
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,805
OZZY HAS HIS KEY AGAIN.

251
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,600
THIS TIME IT IS STAYING ON.

252
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,435
OZZY HAS HIS FIRST KEY.

253
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,271
LOOKING FOR TWO MORE.

254
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:23,813
KRISTINE, QUICKLY MAKING AN

255
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,983
ADJUSTMENT.

256
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,652
OZZY STRETCHING OUT AGAIN HIS

257
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,614
POLE, JUST LONG ENOUGH.

258
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,700
OZZY HAS THE SECOND KEY.

259
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,827
OZZY NOW WITH ONE KEY LEFT,

260
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,995
KRISTINE NEEDS TO PICK IT UP

261
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,789
RIGHT NOW.

262
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,791
OZZY HAS HIS THIRD KEY! OZZY

263
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,460
HAS ALL THREE KEYS.

264
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,129
KRISTINE HAS NONE.

265
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,840
OZZY NOW HAS TO UNLOCK THE LOCKS

266
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,842
AND THIS DUAL IS OVER.

267
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,136
OZZY HAS ONE LOCK UNDONE.

268
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,847
KRISTINE NOT GIVING UP WITH THAT

269
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,806
POLE, THAT POLE IS FALLING

270
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,515
APART.

271
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,475
OZZY HAS HIS SECOND LOCK UNDONE.

272
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,854
THIS WILL DO IT.

273
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,857
OZZY UNLOCKS THE THIRD LOCK.

274
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,692
OZZY WINS THE DUAL AND IS BACK

275
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:19,493
IN THIS GAME!

276
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:26,709
GREAT GAME!

277
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,879
Jeff: KRISTINE, AFTER 19

278
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,173
DIFFICULT DAYS YOUR ADVENTURE

279
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,049
HAS COME TO AN END.

280
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,716
IT IS.

281
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,884
IT IS A GOOD 40TH BIRTHDAY

282
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,468
PRESENT.

283
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,219
IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

284
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:37,720
ALL RIGHT.

285
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,681
GOOD LUCK.

286
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,183
WAY TO GO KRISTINE.

287
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,518
GOOD LUCK, EVERYBODY.

288
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:44,894
THIS MIGHT EXPLODE, CAREFUL.

289
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,897
STAY BACK.

290
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,861
Jeff: OZZY AS FAST AS YOU

291
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,404

CONGRATULATIONS.

294
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:58,949
YOU ARE NOW BACK IN THE HUNT FOR

295
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,409
THE MONEY, AND YOU AND EVERYBODY

296
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,454
ELSE HERE CAN DROP YOUR BUFFS.

297
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:03,996
YES!

298
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,914

00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:09,520
THOUGH.

320
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,105

SO EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR AN

322
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:21,365

LAST NIGHT?

324
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,495

THE WAY THEY TREATED ME, I

00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,861
THOUGHT IT WAS HORRIBLE.

337
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,404
LIKE KEITH, THE WAY KEITH

OZZY WOULD WIN REDEMPTION, IT

354
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,905
WAS A RISK, THAT OZZY WOULD WIN

355
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,197
REDEMPTION.

378
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,155
SUPERIOR IN ONE WAY TO PEOPLE

379
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,949
AND THEY KNOW IT, SO THEY FIND

380
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,077
WAYS THAT YOU ARE INFERIOR TO

381
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,744
THEM.

382
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,621
I KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE,

383
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,330
MAN, BUT YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO

384
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,250
CHANGE THE GAME FOR YOURSELF.

385
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,253
THERE IS A LINE IN THE SAND.

386
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,963
COME ACROSS THAT LINE.

387
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,590
ALL IN ALL, WHAT I TOOK AWAY

388
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,133
FROM COACH IS HE IS INCREDIBLY

389
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:44,633
INTELLIGENT GUY.

390
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,012
I WATCHED HIM, HE IS

391
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,138
ECCENTRIC, DRAGON SLAYER WHO

392
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,432
TALKS ABOUT BUSINESS SARDZ AND

393
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,141
KING ARTHUR, BUT HE IS A SMART

394
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,810
GUY AND COACH LAID IT ALL ON THE

395
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,313
TABLE FOR ME SAYING, I COULD

396
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,149
MAKE US DRAW ROCKS THE NEXT

397
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,150
TRIBAL COUNCIL OR WHAT I AM

398
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,819
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING I COULD

399
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:04,486
COMPLETELY JUMP SHIP AND BETRAY

400
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,822
MY OLD TRIBE AND JOIN UPOLU.

401
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,533
THERE WAS NO ILLUSION.

402
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,368
I SAW SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE IN

403
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,077
TEARS.

404
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,999
THE NIGHT OF THE CHALLENGE --

405
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,210
I MEAN --

406
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,174
OZZY WOKE UP, HE HAD A DREAM.

407
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:31,221
THE DREAM WAS HE WANTS

408
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,389
REDEMPTION.

409
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,853
IT IS NOT DISLOYAL --

410
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,022
THE WRITING ON THE WALL IS

411
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,315
THAT YOU ARE NOT IN THEIR,

412
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,149
WHATEVER, INNER CIRCLE FOR

413
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,192
WHATEVER REASON.

414
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,360
YOU HAVE BEEN MISTREATED LIKE

415
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,362
YOU MADE IT PRETTY CLEARLY

416
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,907
OBVIOUS.

417
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,200
I THINK PART OF THE IDEA

418
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,536
RIGHT NOW IS I AM SUPPOSED TO BE

419
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,996
GATHERING INFORMATION, YOU KNOW.

420
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,707
OH, IS THAT WHAT THEY HAVE

421
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:58,999
COMMANDED?

422
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,753
YEAH.

423
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,504
WHO HAS BEEN GIVING YOU THE

424
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,006
MOST TROUBLE AND WHO WOULD GIVE

425
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,884
YOU THE MOST SCARED --

426
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:14,056
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

427
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,935
KEITH HAS BEEN MORE

428
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,772
CONSISTENTLY WITH ME

429
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,732
BY ALL MEANS YOU WILL BE

430
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,235
COMPLETELY PROTECTED BY ME FROM

431
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:26,902
ANY OF THEM.

432
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,278
THERE IS A LOT OF DOWN SIDES

433
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:28,946
TO JUMPING SHIP, BUT ON THE

434
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,239
OTHER HAND, I DO BELIEVE THE

435
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,575
UPOLU MEMBERS ARE SUPER SOLID,

436
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,411
COMPLETELY HONEST, AND

437
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,078
TRUSTWORTHY, YOU KNOW, I

438
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,414
CONSIDER MYSELF A STRATEGY GIST,

439
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,248
AND MAYBE EVEN A MASTERMIND BUT

440
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,460
NOT AN EVIL MASTERMIND, SO I

441
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,214
RETURN TO GIVE THE IMMUNITY IDOL

442
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,091
TO OZZY, HE GAVE IT TO ME IN

443
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,301
COMPLETE TRUST AND I AM GOING TO

444
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,553
RECIPROCATE, UP TO THE POINT IN

445
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,262
THE GAME I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN

446
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,723
PUTTING MY FATE IN THE HANDS OF

447
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,890
TRIBE MATE I DON'T ENTIRELY

448
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,935
TRUST AND WHO, A AND WHO DON'T

449
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,645
ENTIRELY RESPECT ME, NOW IT HAS

450
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,105
BECOME AN INDIVIDUAL GAME AND I

451
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,106
FEEL LIKE I AM IN CONTROL OF MY

452
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:04,815
FATE.

453
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,608
I HAVE DECISIONS OF WHO I WANT

454
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,901
TO WORK WITH AND BETRAY.

455
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,945
IT IS A LITTLE SURREAL BUT ALSO

456
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,447
A LITTLE BIT OF EXCITING THAT I

457
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,614
AM THE PERSON RIGHT NOW THAT

458
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,950
GETS TO DECIDE HOW SURVIVOR

459
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:15,409
SOUTH PACIFIC TAKES SHAPE AND

460
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,369
POSSIBLY ENDS.

461
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,260
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN?

462
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:39,850
I AM VOTE STRAIGHT TICKET

463
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,559
REGARDLESS.

464
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,103
IF THERE IS A TIE, THERE IS A

465
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:47,858
REVOTE, I JUST WANT TO DRAW A

466
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,108
ROCK.

467
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,320
I DO FEEL LIKE THERE HAS BEEN

468
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,782
A TON OF DISRESPECT, AND A

469
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,283
FLASHBACK THE LAST 21 DAYS WE

470
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,159
ARE ON THE OUTS.

471
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,036
COCHRAN AND I WENT TO GET

472
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,162
TREE MAIL THIS MORNING AND I

473
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,040
KNOW FOR PROBABLY A GOOD 20 DAYS

474
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,208
THAT COCHRAN AND I HAVE BEEN OUT

475
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,085
HERE I WATCHED COCHRAN

476
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,962
SPECIFICALLY BE REALLY TREATED

477
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,464
NOT AS AN EQUAL IN THE GROUP.

478
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,132
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN

479
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,886
THINKING ABOUT RECENTLY.

480
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,556
OH, GOSH.

481
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,891
I AM CRYING AT TREE MAIL.

482
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,185
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

483
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,021
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

484
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,773
I FEEL LIKE WE AGREED TO STAY

485
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,066
WITH EVERYBODY ON THE TRIBE AND

486
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,026
I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU MEET THESE

487
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:34,321
PEOPLE AND THEY ARE A LOT -- IT

488
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:34,696
IS FRUSTRATING.

489
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,906
DON'T WORRY.

490
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,407
AS A SURVIVOR FAN AND I WATCH

491
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,325
THE GAME I LOVE TO WATCH PEOPLE

492
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,661
STAND UP FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE

493
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,204
IN, KIND OF AT THE EXPENSE OF

494
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:42,871
THE MILLION DOLLARS.

495
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,623
I MEAN I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD

496
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,374
HAVE STOOD UP FOR COCHRAN

497
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,377
SOONER.

498
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,711
SORRY.

499
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,755
HE IS A REALLY GREAT KID, AND HE

500
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,549
REMINDS ME A LOT OF, I HAVE A

501
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,010
SON THAT REMINDS ME ON OF HIM,

502
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:57,719
WITH RED HAIR BUT YOU TRY TO

503
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,680
PROTECT YOUR INTERESTS AND YOU

504
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,722
WANT TO STAY.

505
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,099
WHAT I HAVE BEEN THINKING IS,

506
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,726
UP UNTIL THIS POINT, MY ENTIRE

507
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,270
STATE IN THE GAME, FATE IN THE

508
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,396
GAME HAS BEEN HANDED OVER TO

509
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,982
OTHER PEOPLE, BUT I HAVE BEEN

510
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,525
GROVELING AND BEGGING NOT TO BE

511
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,361
VOTED OUT SINCE THE FIRST TRIBAL

512
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,779
COUNCIL, NOW WHAT WE ARE

513
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,990
EXPECTING TO DO, EXPECTED TO DO

514
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:22,870
IS COMPLETELY GIVE OF OUR GAMES,

515
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,288
WITH THE WHOLE DRAWING ROCK

516
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,331
THING, FROM THE FIRST MOMENT

517
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,457
WHEN I AND I THINK YOU TOO CAN

518
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,793
FINALLY DECIDE ON WHAT COURSE TO

519
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,085
TAKE.

520
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:30,669
OKAY.

521
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,421
AND I ALWAYS TRIED TO

522
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,463
REMEMBER IT IS A GAME FOR A

523
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,132
MILLION DOLLARS, YOU KNOW, AND

524
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,425
THAT THIS IS A GAME WITH

525
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,218
CASUALTIES, BUT I DON'T REALLY

526
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,555
WANT THE CASUALTY TO BE COCHRAN.

527
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,265
YES, IT IS FRIGHTENING HOW

528
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:43,849
ALLIANCES SWING.

529
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,144
IT IS MORE THAN PARANOID

530
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:47,769
AGGRAVATION.

531
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,812
YOU ARE COLD AND TIRED AND

532
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,982
LOSING SLEEP ONLY THE NECKLACE

533
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,984
GIVES A SAFE SENSATION.

534
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,277
OKAY.

535
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,153
GAME ON.

536
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,446
AND IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS A

537
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,323
WAY FOR ME TO SAY I DON'T LIKE

538
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,242
THE WAY IT HAS BEEN GOING, EVEN

539
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,453
IF IT MEANS, YOU KNOW, I LOSE MY

540
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:11,585
FOOTING IN THE GAME.

541
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:22,512
COME ON IN, GUYS.

542
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,473
SO, KEITH, WHAT IS THE NEW

543
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,140
TRIBE NAME?

544
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:28,518
THE NEW TRIBE NAME IS BASED

545
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,311
FROM THE STORY OF HOW THE

546
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,523
COCONUT GAME TO ME, TETUNA.

547
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,692
YOU ARE READY TO GET TO YOUR

548
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,277
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

549
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,320
CHALLENGE AND I WILL TAKE BACK

550
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,323
TRIBAL IMMUNITY.

551
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,575
TRIBAL IMMUNITY IS NO MORE,

552
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,118
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS NOW WHAT

553
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,121
YOU COVET.

554
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,331
TODAY, THERE ARE TWO NECKLACES,

555
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,499
BECAUSE TWO PEOPLE WILL LEAVE

556
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,459
THIS CHALLENGE WITH IMMUNITY,

557
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,544
ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN.

558
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,881
HERE IS HOW IT WORKS.

559
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,132
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL

560
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,636
BALANCE ON A SMALL PERCH WHILE

561
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,388
HOLDING A COCONUT BETWEEN TWO

562
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,806
ROPES, AT REGULAR INTERVALS WE

563
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,808

566
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,355
IF AT ANY POINT YOUR COCONUT

567
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:13,855

COCHRAN IS ALREADY WAVERING.

587
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,401

00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,674
RICK WAS WOBBLING AT THE END OF

631
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,301

THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.

656
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,783
IT IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST DAYS WE

WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,093

TONIGHT AND SENT TO REDEMPTION

679
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,142
ISLAND.

680
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:01,810
YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE

681
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,811
OUT WHO IT IS GOING TO BE.

682
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,187
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND SEE YOU BACK

683
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,272
AT CAMP.

684
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,732
I WILL SEE YOU BACK AT TRIBAL.

685
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,833
GREAT JOB.

686
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,334
HEY, YOU GUYS DID WHAT WE NEEDED

687
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,628
TO DO, SERIOUSLY.

688
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,338
INCREASE THE NUMBERS, BIG TIME.

689
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,134
FOUR TO SIX NOW.

690
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,052
WE BETTER START REEVALUATING

691
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,846
WHERE THEY ALL LIE.

692
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,889
SOPHIE WOULD BE MY PICK.

693
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,684
IF ANYTHING IF WE ARE GOING

694
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,477
TO SWING ANY OTHER WAY IT IS FOR

695
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,020
RICK.

696
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,062
I THINK WE RUN THE LEAST

697
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,689
AMOUNT OF RISK IN TERMS OF AN

698
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,857
IDOL PLAY IF WE GO WITH RICK.

699
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,360
ONE MORE TIME.

700
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,278
EVERYBODY IS SOLID?

701
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:58,366
YES.

702
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,828
WE ARE ALL THROWING ROCKS.

703
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:02,412
PHYSICALLY.

704
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,165
OKAY, NOW I AM WORRIED.

705
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,625
EVERYBODY IS OKAY WITH

706
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,171
THROWING ROCKS.

707
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,547
KEITH, ARE YOU THROWING A ROCK?

708
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,089
YEAH.

709
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,549
AS OF RIGHT NOW, MY

710
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,259
IMPRESSION IS THAT BOTH TRIBES

711
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,219
BELIEVE THAT IT IS GOING TO BE A

712
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:18,887
DEADLOCK AT THE VOTE.

713
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,558
NOBODY LIKES THE IDEA OF PICKING

714
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:27,187
ROCKS FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.

715
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,688
BUT GO SAVAII MEMBERS HAVE

716
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,397
IMMUNITY, IT IS GREAT FOR US

717
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,399
BECAUSE IF IT COMES DOWN TO A

718
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,027
PICK EM THERE ARE TEN PICKS AND

719
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,778
ONLY FOUR OF US ON THE CHOPPING

720
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,445
BLOCK AND SIX OF THEM.

721
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,905
SO YOU AND I ARE OUT OF THE

722
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,572
VOTE.

723
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,782
WE ARE OUT OF THE VOTE AND

724
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,201
WHOEVER PLAYS THE IDOL IS OUT OF

725
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,410
THE VOTE.

726
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,162
THEY WOULD NEVER THINK THAT

727
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:44,496
WHITNEY WOULD HAVE IT.

728
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,914
NOT EVER.

729
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,250
WHICH MEANS I PRETTY MUCH

730
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,126
BASICALLY HAVE TO PLAY THE IDOL.

731
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,753
I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

732
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,129
VOTE FOR WHITNEY.

733
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,756
WHY? BECAUSE IF IT GOES TO

734
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,216
ROCKS, WHITNEY IS IMMUNE FROM

735
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,550
THE ROCKS AND THEY WANT TO HAVE

736
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,135
SOME OF THE STRONGER PLAYERS IN

737
00:27:59,219 --> 00:27:59,844
THERE, ME AND KEITH, AND IN

738
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,139
THEIR MINDS, THEY CAN GET RID OF

739
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:03,807
WHITNEY LATER.

740
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,184
DO WE WANT TO HAVE COCHRAN,

741
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,978
THEN, STILL BE A LITTLE WAFFLY

742
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:09,646
TODAY?

743
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,607
IF THEY TELL ME MIGHT BE TO

744
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,567
VOTE FOR THEN WE KNOW THAT'S NOT

745
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,443
WHO THEY ARE VOTING FOR.

746
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,986
SAVAII MAY FEEL CONFIDENT

747
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,947
THAT WE HAVE A THREE OUT OF

748
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,948
EIGHT SHOT OR WHATEVER THE

749
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,782
NUMBERS ARE, BUT THOSE NUMBERS

750
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,784
AREN'T THAT REASSURING TO ME,

751
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,453
EVEN IF IT IS ONE OUT OF 30 THAT

752
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,037
A ROCK WOULD SEND ME HOME I

753
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:26,788
WOULDN'T WANT TO DO IT.

754
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,915
THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS GAME IS

755
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:29,582
ABOUT.

756
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,291
I LOVE THIS GAME AND RESPECT

757
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,085
THIS GAME BUT I DON'T RESPECT

758
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,628
REDUCING MY GAME TO A GAME OF

759
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,004
CHANCE AND PULLING A ROCK OUT OF

760
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:39,175
A BAG.

761
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,427
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS,

762
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,263
THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR RICK.

763
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:43,972
ORIGINALLY IT WAS GOING TO BE

764
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,639
YOU.

765
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:46,933
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE

766
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:47,475
ME.

767
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,018
THE LAST SECOND, OZZY IS

768
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:55,483
GOING TO STAND UP, GIVE -- I

769
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,652
MEAN, HAVE LIKE RICK PLAY IDOL

770
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:57,944
AND --

771
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,780
RIGHT.

772
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,324
I UNDERSTAND, BUT I THINK THAT

773
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,075
THIS IS SURVIVOR.

774
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,994
I TRUST YOU.

775
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,329
BUT HAVE GOT TO REALIZE WHERE WE

776
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:08,705
ARE KOCHING FROM.

777
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:13,209
I DO, I DO.

778
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:22,927
I HOPE -- DON'T DO ME ANY

779
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:23,636
FAVORS.

780
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,221
DON'T LET ME GET EATEN ALIVE.

781
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,016
I KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE --

782
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:28,850
YEAH, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE

783
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,434
FUN.

784
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,519
YOU CAN NEVER COUNT ON

785
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,520
SOMEONE COMING OVER AND NEVER

786
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,521
KNOW FOR SURE.

787
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,566
THAT SAID, I THINK I FEEL AS

788
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,901
CONFIDENT ABOUT COCHRAN FLING

789
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,277
OVER, BECAUSE COCHRAN THINKS IF

790
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,029
HE PUSHES AND COMES BACK TO CAMP

791
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,447
HE IS GOING TO GET BEAT UP,

792
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,699
WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE THING FOR

793
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:52,707
A TARGET TO BE AFRAID OF.

794
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,250
THEY ARE GOING TO KILL ME

795
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,001
TONIGHT.

796
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,711
THEY ARE GOING TO EAT ME ALIVE.

797
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:58,254
THAT IS WHAT I AM DREADING.

798
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,048
I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO EAT

799
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,715
THEM ALIVE.

800
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,884
WHERE AM I SLEEPING TONIGHT?

801
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:08,056
RIGHT BETWEEN ME AND EDNA.

802
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:08,932
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

803
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:09,516
CARTE BLANCHE.

804
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,309
WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY

805
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,560
TWISTS BUT TO FLUS COCHRAN

806
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,020
BECAUSE THE ODDS ARE NOT IN OUR

807
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,897
FAVOR, IT LOOKS GRIM, IT LOOKS

808
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,190
DISMAL, SO I HAVE DONE

809
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,274
EVERYTHING I COULD, I HAVE

810
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,734
GOTTEN COCHRAN ON OUR SIDE TO

811
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,944
PLAY THE REST OF THIS GAME, I

812
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,445
HAVE CONVINCED HIM HE WILL BE

813
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,988
VALUED OVER HERE AND I HAVE

814
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,865
CONVINCED COCHRAN HE WILL BE THE

815
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,785
MAN OF THE MATCH, THE WEAK WILL

816
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,328
FINALLY BECOME STRONG, THAT THE

817
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,080
NERD WILL FINALLY RISE UP TO THE

818
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,123
BULLY AND GIVE HIM A BULLY

819
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:42,549
BEATDOWN.

820
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:47,470
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

821
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,431
OH, I AM -- I WON'T SAY A

822
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,099
THING.

823
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,727
I AM JUST GOING TO LET YOU PLAY.

824
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,563
THAT IS MY PRELIMINARY PLAN.

825
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,774
I MEAN THERE ARE A FEW OUTS.

826
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,109
BEFORE THE CHALLENGE, I JUST

827
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,152
THOUGHT, TO ME, THIS IS LIKE

828
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,112
STARTING A WAR AND THAT IS NOT

829
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,990
HOW YOU REMEDY SOMETHING.

830
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,492
I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES.

831
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,410
THEY ARE PROMISES, THOUGH.

832
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,412
WHY WOULD THEY WATCH OUT FOR

833
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,329
YOU OVER THEIR OWN PEOPLE.

834
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,456
IF THEY HAVE TWO OF THEIR

835
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,833
PEOPLE WINNING IMMUNITY TODAY

836
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,501
THEY WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO YOU.

837
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,337
DAWN APPARENTLY IS NOW

838
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,381
UNWILLING TO FLIP HER VOTE

839
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,632
ALONGSIDE ME AND UPOLU, IT GIVES

840
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,300
ME SOME PAUSE IN DEBATING

841
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,009
WHETHER OR NOT I WANT TO MAKE

842
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,137
THE JUMP, BUT IT IS A TOUGH

843
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,138
CHOICE, SHOULD GUY WITH A BUNCH

844
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,139
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIND OF BEEN

845
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,143
RUDE TO ME PAST 21 DAYS OR DITCH

846
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,021
THE ENTIRE ROCK SCENARIO AND

847
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,356
COST MYSELF A MILLION DOLLARS

848
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,649
BECAUSE I WILL CAUSE SO MANY

849
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,942
PEOPLE TO BE FURIOUS AT ME.

850
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,403
I TOTALLY WILL PLAY YOUR GAME

851
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,154
I AM TELLING YOU WHAT GOES

852
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,156
AROUND COPS AROUND, THE WAY YOU

853
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,449
TREAT PEOPLE, TOTALLY AFFECTS

854
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,034
THE WAY THAT YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE,

855
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,035
AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO

856
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,786
AFFECT EVERYTHING.

857
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,122
THERE IS NO WAY THAT --

858
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,040
THE RUDENESS, THE LACK OF

859
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,376
COURTESY, THE LACK OF RESPECT --

860
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,836
I WANT TO BE IN CONTROL FOR

861
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,296
THE FIRST TIME IN MY GAME.

862
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,213
I FEEL LIKE I AM BY SAYING

863
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,257
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WON'T TAKE

864
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,509
YOUR CRAP.

865
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,470
LOOK, IT IS NOT ABOUT THAT AT

866
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:10,928
THIS POINT.

867
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,680
IT IS ABOUT THAT.

868
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,223
TO ME, YOU ARE APPEALING TO YOUR

869
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:14,807
EMOTION.

870
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,852
I AM AN EMOTIONAL GUY.

871
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,188
OH, BEFORE I WENT TO THE

872
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,065
CHALLENGE, I REALLY SPENT SOME

873
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,024
TIME LIKE LITERALLY PRAYING, I

874
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,026
KNOW IT SOUNDS CLICHE BUT I KIND

875
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,487
OF BACKED OFF MY ORIGINAL

876
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,905
FEELING OF MAYBE I SHOULD FLIP

877
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,824
WITH COCHRAN, BECAUSE I REALIZED

878
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,826
I HAVE LIKED MY TRIBE, IT HASN'T

879
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,578
BEEN AS KUMBAYA AS I THINK THE

880
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,996
OTHER TRIBE BUT THERE ARE THINGS

881
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,580
ABOUT EACH OF THOSE PEOPLE I

882
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,082
LOVE AND I HAVE HAD GREAT

883
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,041
EXPERIENCES WITH THEM AND I

884
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,709
DON'T WANT TO GO BACK ON THAT, I

885
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,711
WANT TO STAY LOYAL TO THE TRIBE.

886
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,089
HOW ARE YOU DOING, BRO?

887
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,049
WE ARE ALMOST THERE.

888
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,092
GET BACK IN THE FOLD.

889
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,219
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THE REST

890
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,220
OF THE TRIBE BECAUSE I CAN

891
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,304
UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS BEHALFING

892
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,723
BUT I AM PRAYING HE DOESN'T AND

893
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,433
I HAVE LET HIM KNOW I AM

894
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,101
DISAPPOINTED, I DON'T THINK IT

895
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,310
IS RIGHT TO PHLEGM, I DON'T.

896
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,728
AND I FEEL LIKE HE IS WATCHING

897
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,396
OUT FOR HIMSELF TONIGHT AND NO

898
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,481
ONE ELSE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO

899
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,274
TELL EVERYBODY, BECAUSE I THINK

900
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,567
THERE IS HOPE THAT HE IS GOING

901
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,735
TO NOT DO DO IT, I HAVE LET HIM

902
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,197
KNOW, I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IT.

903
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,132
SO, COACH, SIX FORMER SAVAII,

904
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,175
SIX FORMER UPOLU, IF YOU WERE

905
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,218
GOING TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION IT

906
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,720
SEEMS THAT WE MIGHT BE LOOKING

907
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,221
AT A TIE VOTE TONIGHT.

908
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,598
THAT IS CORRECT WE WILL BE

909
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,641
PUTTING ALL OF THE CARDS ON

910
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,767
TABLE TONIGHT.

911
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,938
AND YOU WILL SEE MOST LIKELY SIX

912
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:44,522
AND SIX.

913
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,481
Jeff: OZZY, RING TRUE TO

914
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:45,773
YOU?

915
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,233
YEAH.

916
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:47,900
DEFINITELY.

917
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:48,943
WE WENT INTO THIS CHALLENGE

918
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,570
TODAY KNOWING WE REALLY NEEDED

919
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,614
TO GET BOTH OF THE IMMUNITY

920
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,782
NECKLACES BECAUSE CHANCES WERE

921
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,951
WE ARE GOING TO TIE UP AND IT

922
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,286
WAS GOING TO GO TO ROCKS AND IF

923
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,288
IT DOES, WE BETTER HAVE THE ODDS

924
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,249
ON OUR SIDE, AND WE ARE ALL

925
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,125
GOING TO BE SAFE, I GUESS.

926
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:04,751
Jeff: AND THE REASON THE

927
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,337
STAKES ARE SO HIGH, DAWN,

928
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,006
BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO A TIE AND

929
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,799
WE VOTE AGAIN AND YOU ARE STILL

930
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,508
TIED THE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

931
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,552
VOTES ARE IMMUNE AND EVERYBODY

932
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,429
ELSE IS DRAWING ROCKS WHICH IS A

933
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:16,721
BIG RISK.

934
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,305
BIG SEX.

935
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,682
IT IS WORTH A BIG RISK.

936
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,976
SO THE ONLY WAY TO BREAK UP A

937
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,227
TIE IS SOMEBODY HAS TO DEFECT TO

938
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,980
THE OTHER TRIBE.

939
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,149
EDNA, CAN YOU SEE ANY SCENARIO

940
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,317
THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR

941
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,319
SOMEBODY TO SWITCH?

942
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,822
IF THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL DIDN'T

943
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,991
FEEL INCORPORATED OR A PART OF

944
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,952
THAT TRIBE, THAT WOULD BE ONE

945
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:40,620
REASON.

946
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,329
Jeff: COCHRAN YOU HAVE SAID

947
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,288
IT MANY TIMES YOU ARE A STUDENT

948
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:42,997
OF THE GAME.

949
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,332
WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT YOU WOULD

950
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,542
HAVE TWO TRIBES THIS UNIFIED?

951
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,669
I HAVE NEVER SEEN TWO TRIBES

952
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,171
THAT SEEM SO ENTIRELY COHESIVE

953
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,715
IN THEIR OWN SEPARATE WAYS, IN

954
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,382
TERMS OF ODDS, I DON'T KNOW

955
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,343
ODDS, I DON'T DO ODDS, I DO

956
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,054
SURVIVOR.

957
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:58,763
Jeff: JIM, WHAT ARE THE

958
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,556
CHANCES SOMEBODY FROM YOUR TRIBE

959
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,141
WALKS OVER AND JOINS THEIR

960
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:02,767
TRIBE?

961
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,310
ZERO, IT MAKES NO SENSE WE

962
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,353
HAVE THE NUMBERS ON OUR SIDE, IT

963
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,855
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR ONE

964
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,856
OF US TO DO THAT.

965
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,316
Jeff: ALBERT IS THERE MUCH

966
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,567
TALK ABOUT THE IDOL, WHETHER

967
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,570
EACH TRIBE MAY HAVE FOUND AN

968
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,196
IDOL.

969
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:15,863
WE WERE ALL PRESENT AT THE

970
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,740
DUAL AND OZZY DID HIS BEST

971
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,367
BROADWAY PRODUCTION TO SEE HOW

972
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,202
HE FELT BACK STAB AND HURT ABOUT

973
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,703
THE IDOL AND TIME TO FIND OUT IF

974
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,580
THAT WAS ALL A SHOW, BECAUSE IF

975
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,624
THEY HAVE AN IDOL THAT THEY

976
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,583
PLAY, THAT MEANS THERE WASN'T

977
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,836
REALLY AN IDOL PLAYED AT THEIR

978
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,045
ORIGINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

979
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,880
Jeff: SOPHIE, IS IT A

980
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,881
CONSENSUS OZZY WASN'T TELLING

981
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,050
THE TRUTH OR IS IT A QUESTION

982
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,385
AND YOU ARE HOPING TO FIND OUT

983
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,052
TONIGHT?

984
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:38,761
I WAS ACTUALLY OFFENDED AT

985
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,805
REDEMPTION KIND THE SIX OF THEM

986
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,764
THOUGHT WE WOULD BELIEVE THAT

987
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,891
AND I FOUND IT TO BE OVER THE

988
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,227
TOP AND SOMEWHAT PATHETIC.

989
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,894
Jeff: OZZY?

990
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,604
YEAH, IT WAS A PERFORMANCE,

991
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,690
MAYBE IT WAS A LITTLE

992
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,607
LACKLUSTER, MAYBE TOO OVER THE

993
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,401
TOP AND YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT, I DO

994
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,736
HAVE THE IDOL.

995
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,864
OR RATHER, WE DO HAVE THE IDOL.

996
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,615
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, I

997
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,242
WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGHT FOR MY

998
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,368
TRIBE AND GIVE US SOME SORT OF

999
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,787
AN ADVANTAGE, AND IF THAT WAS

1000
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,746
PATHETIC, THEN SO BE IT.

1001
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,789
Jeff: AND YOU WERE VERY

1002
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,624
CLEAR JUST THEN, OZZY ABOUT

1003
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,251
SAYING, WE HAVE THE IDOL.

1004
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,044
YES.

1005
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,504
DEFINITELY FOR THIS GROUP.

1006
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,799
AND MOST LIKELY THIS VOTE.

1007
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,508
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY

1008
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,427
WORD FOR IT, WE CAN GO AHEAD AND

1009
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,763
DO THIS.

1010
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,473
THAT'S IT.

1011
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,142
Jeff: WITH THAT, IT IS TIME

1012
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,476
TO VOTE.

1013
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,769
YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR OZZY.

1014
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,938
YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR DAWN.

1015
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,648
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1016
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,065
RICK.

1017
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:42,241
YOU ARE UP.

00:36:42,325 --> 00:37:02,678
YOU ARE UP.

00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,805
Jeff: I WILL GO TALLY THE

00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,387
Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN

1030
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,137
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1031
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,556
ANY VOTES CAST FOR WHITNEY WILL

1032
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,642
NOT COUNT.

1033
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:54,480
I WILL READ THE VOTES.

DON'T TALK TO HIM LIKE THAT.

1095
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,724
THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

1096
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,393
WELL, THAT WAS WITHOUT QUESTION

1097
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:20,561

YOU TOTALLY SCREWED ME OVER.

1107
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,137
YOU DISGUST ME.

1108
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,097
MY HOPE I CAN GET A COUPLE TO

1116
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:23,958

WASTED THE IDOL, SO REALLY, IT

1118
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,963
