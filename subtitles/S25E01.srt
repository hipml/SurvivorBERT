342
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,154
I COULD HAVE POSSIBLY TORN MY

00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:18,320
M.C.L.

344
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,280
THIS IS TOO BAD TO BELIEVE.

345
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,240
IF MY TEAMMATES SMELL BLOOD

346
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,241
THEY'RE GOING TO KICK ME OFF

347
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,326

348
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,302

WELCOME HOME, PEOPLE!

ROLE BUT THIS TIME THE WHOLE

356
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,149
LEADERSHIP AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

357
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,817
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LISTEN, I MEAN,

358
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,986

(LAUGHS)

362
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,992
SO NO LEADERS HERE, WE'RE ALL A

363
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,035
TEAM.

364
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,745
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY DO.

365
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,370
THEY CAN VOTE FOR CHIEF, THEY

366
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,039
CAN VOTE FOR TWO CHIEFS, THEY

367
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,832
CAN VOTE FOR HIGH SUPREME.

368
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,209
WHATEVER IT IS, I'M NOT GOING TO

369
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,126
BE IT.

ALL RIGHT?

374
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,594
>> I'LL CARRY WHATEVER Y'ALL

375
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,637
WANT ME TO.

376
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,514
>> MY PLAN IS TO FEEL THEM OUT

377
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,848
AND IF THIS LEADERSHIP THING

378
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,974
COMES UP THROW IT AT THE GUY WHO

379
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,893
DOESN'T REALIZE THAT LEADERSHIP

380
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,894
IS A GOOD THING.

381
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,187
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS SOME GUY

382
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,396
WHO'S AN IDIOT.

383
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,856
"I THINK I SHOULD BE THE

384
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,774
LEADER."

385
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,983
"OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE THE

386
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,150
MAN.

387
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,152
THANK YOU, MY HERO!"

388
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,863
JUST WATCH THEM CRASH AND BURN.

389
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,072
DUMBNY.

390
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,158
(LAUGHS)

391
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,536
THE IDEA IS YOU WANT IT TO JUST

392
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,372
BREAK WHERE IT'S SCORED.

393
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,207
WHAT I WANT IS SOMETHING

394
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,459
UNDERNEATH THAT'S GONNA SIT ON

395
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:55,834
THIS.

396
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,086
YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY TO CUT ON

397
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:57,586
THE KNUCKLE?

398
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,128
>> YOU DON'T?

399
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,004
>> NO!

400
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,091
KNUCKLE IS THE HARDEST PART TO

401
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:02,341
CUT.

402
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,725
>> WHAT WE'LL DO, HAVE THE FIRE

403
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,185
PIT DOWN LIKE CLOSER TO THAT

404
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,937
PART OF THE TREE DOWN THERE.

405
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,855
>> RUSSELL KEEPS TELLING US THAT

406
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,524
HE'S NOT THE LEADER BUT HE'S THE

407
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,150
ONE SITTING THERE SAYING "OKAY,

408
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,860
GUYS, TAKE A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK,

409
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,278
DRINK SOME WATER."

410
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,155
LIKE, OKAY, WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO

411
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:25,322
HIM.

412
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,115
>> YOU LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT

413
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:26,448
YOU'RE DOING.

414
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:26,949
>> (LAUGHS)

415
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,868
>> WE DO NEED A LEADER BUT I

416
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,452
JUST FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD ALL

417
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,455
JUST WORK TOGETHER NOT LIKE FOR

418
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:33,872
HIM.

419
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,213
>> IF ANYBODY WANTS TO HAVE AT

420
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:41,547
THAT!

421
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,299
>> YOU WANT TO GIVE THAT SHOT.

422
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,092
>> I LIVED IN MICRONESIA FOR A

423
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:45,301
YEAR.

424
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,761
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

425
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,222
I LIVED IN MICRONESIA TEACHING

426
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,432
E.S.L. TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

427
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:51,640
KIDS.

428
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,224
I WASN'T ROUGHING IT ANYTHING

429
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,184
LIKE THIS BUT I CAN DO THE FIRE,

430
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,061
I CAN DO PALM FRONDS, COCONUTS,

431
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:56,937
THINGS LIKE THAT.

432
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,440
TAKE IT SLOW AND SMOOTH, GET A

433
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,358
FEEL FOR WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING.

434
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,863
JUST GETTING THE WOOD WARM.

435
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:05,988
A.

436
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,072
>> THEY'RE SHARING FIRE?

437
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:07,698
>> YEAH.

438
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,117
>> IT'S STARTING TO SMELL.

439
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,453
>> GOT A LITTLE SMOKE, KEEP

440
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,579
GOING, ATTA BOY!

441
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,039
COME ON.

442
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,333
ALL RIGHT.

443
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,003
LET'S SEE IT.

444
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,381
YOU'RE STILL SMOKING, WE GOT IT.

445
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,633
>> OH, MY DAMN!

446
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,592
>> COME ON!

447
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:31,597
>> WHO'S STARTING THE FIRE?

448
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,015
>> GRASS.

449
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:39,188
>> WHOA!

450
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,398
>> RUSSELL--

451
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,025
>> COME IN, NICELY DONE!

452
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,027
>> KICKED SOME ASS.

453
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,028
>> THANK YOU, PEOPLE.

454
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,071
GUESS WHAT WE HAVE?

455
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,198
>> FIRE!

456
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,282
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

457
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,534
>> WE MADE FIRE IN THE FIRST,

458
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,579
LIKE, 45 MINUTES WE WERE HERE.

459
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,456
I WOULD GIVE MY BUTT TO KNOW IF

460
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,667
ANYBODY ELSE HAS GOT FIRE.

461
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,417
YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT IT.

462
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,211
>> BROTHER KNOWS HOW TO WORK.

463
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,504
JUST TELL ME.

464
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,755
I'LL WORK FOR YOU, JUST TELL ME

465
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:05,214
WHAT TO DO SOMETIMES.

466
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,049
>> HIGH FIVE ALL THE WAY AROUND.

467
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,551
>> YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT TO BELIEVE

468
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:09,718
IT.

469
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,762
>> DAY ONE, WE GOT THE FIRE

470
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:11,970
GOING.

471
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,555
RUSSELL IS THE ONE WHO DID IT

472
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,682
WHICH WORKS OUT IN A WAY BECAUSE

473
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,433
HE WANTS TO BE THE LEADER SO BAD

474
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,059
AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE WAY HE

475
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,186
WANTS IT DONE.

476
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,938
SO WHEN HE WAS THE ONE WHO

477
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:21,563
ACTUALLY GOT THE FIRE GOING, IN

478
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,899
A WAY A LITTLE BIT OF A TARGET

479
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,275
CAME OFF MY BACK BECAUSE I'M NOT

480
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,151
A THREAT TO HIM.

481
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,945
>> RIGHT NOW I THINK THE GAME IS

482
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,321
JUST BE NICE TO RUSSELL AND MAKE

483
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,823
HIM FEEL GOOD ABOUT BEING THE

484
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,073
LEADER.

485
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:31,448
>> WHATEVER.

486
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,074
>> WHATEVER.

487
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,284
>> I LET HIM BUILD A FIRE.

488
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,202
SO IT'S KIND OF A BLESSING HE'S

489
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,830
THE ONE WHO PULLED IT OFF AND

490
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,414
HE'S ON CLOUD NINE, WHATEVER

491
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:47,673
PLANET HE'S LIVING ON.

492
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,098
>> YEAH!

493
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,559
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

494
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:02,229
>> OH, MY GOD!

495
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,273
>> THAT WAS JUST FANTASTIC.

496
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,524
>> GOOD JOB.

497
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,109
>> WHAT A BOUNTIMENT LET'S GET

498
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,193
EVERYTHING OFF AND THE THREE OF

499
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,488
US CAN MAYBE JUST GET IT UP

500
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,448
ABOVE THIS TIDELINE.

501
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,283
>> I THINK I LEFT MY KNEE AT THE

502
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:14,992
BOAT GETTING OFF.

503
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:15,576
WE LAUNCHED THAT BOAT, I WAS

504
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,786
TRYING TO HOLD OUR GEAR ON THE

505
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,288
BOAT ITSELF AND MY LEG GOT STUCK

506
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,248
AND I GOT FLIPPED OVER AND--

507
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,584
I'VE PLAYED HURT MY WHOLE

508
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:23,792
CAREER.

509
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,878
I'VE HAD SURGERIES ON MY KNEES.

510
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,087
GETTING ON THIS SAND AND WALKING

511
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,048
AROUND RIGHT NOW, MY KNEE WANTS

512
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,883
TO BUCKLE ON THE INSIDE.

513
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,802
SO I AIN'T-- IT JUST DID IT

514
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:33,969
AGAIN.

515
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,472
I AIN'T FEELING TOO GOOD.

516
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,640
THAT MEDIAL LIGAMENT I THINK IS

517
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:38,974
HURT.

518
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:39,558
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

519
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,727
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW I'M

520
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:41,935
HURT.

521
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:42,478
I'M TRYING TO PLAY IT OFF AS

522
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,812
BEST I CAN FOR NOW.

523
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,855
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING?

524
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,564
>> GOOD.

525
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,024
>> WHAT ARE WE THINKING ABOUT

526
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:47,816
RIGHT IN HERE?

527
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,317
>> YEAH, THAT WILL WORK.

528
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,318
>> READY?

529
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,278
ONE, TWO, THREE.

530
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,822
NICE.

531
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,948
NICE, GOOD JOB.

532
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,950
>> I'M LOOKING AT THIS AS MY

533
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,117
JOB.

534
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,036
THIS IS EARLY GAME, IT'S A

535
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,328
MARATHON.

536
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,537
BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A CRAZY

537
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,748
TWIST OF THE GAME STARTING WITH

538
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,332
THREE TRIBES THROWS THE WHOLE

539
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,878
THING UP IN THE AIR.

540
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,672
TO GET TO DO THIS AGAIN, THIS IS

541
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:15,928
SO MUCH FUN FOR ME AND SO

542
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,178
REWARDING.

543
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,221
THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME OUT HERE

544
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,848
AND DO THIS, EVEN WITH THESE NEW

545
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,641
FOLKS, THEY SEEM VERY COOL.

546
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,975
>> IT'S RIGHTEOUS, Y'ALL.

547
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:22,935
>> IS IT GOOD?

548
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:23,393
>> TAKE A ZIP OF THIS.

549
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,979
>> I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

550
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,147
KICKING SOME A ++S WITH THEM.

551
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,398
IT'S VERY MOVING.

552
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,983
IT'S MOVING TO BE HERE.

553
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,777
IT'S MOVING TO BE DOING THIS

554
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:31,985
AGAIN.

555
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,655
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

556
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,240
>> I KNOW JONATHAN, HE'S A GOOD

557
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:36,406
GUY.

558
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,909
IT'S ALL GOOD.

559
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,535
BUT IF ANYBODY'S GOING TO WIN

560
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,746
THIS GAME IT OUGHT TO BE ONE OF

561
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,121
US.

562
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,122
HE'S A VETERAN.

563
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,499
DO WE WANT A VETERAN TO WIN OR

564
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,500
ONE OF US TO WIN?

565
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,668
>> HE'S RIGHT.

566
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,336
>> SURVIVAL SKILLS HE BRINGS TO

567
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,797
US, MAYBE WE USE HIM FOR A

568
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,422
COUPLE DAYS, AFTER THAT MAYBE WE

569
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,007
THINK ABOUT, OKAY.

570
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:54,591
>> WE'VE GOT THE HANG OF THIS.

571
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,135
>> WE'VE GOT SHELTER, FIRE,

572
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:57,803
WE'VE GOT FOOD.

573
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,470
>> I AGREE.

574
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,557
>> NOT THAT JONATHAN'S NOT A

575
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,100
GOOD GUY BUT THE MERE FACT THAT

576
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,977
HE'S A RETURNING THIRD-TIME

577
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,561
PLAYER, I THINK HE'S HAD HIS

578
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,646
TIME AND I THINK THAT I'D LIKE

579
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,231
TO SEE ONE OF US WIN IT IF IT'S

580
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:09,481
POSSIBLE.

581
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,775
SO HE'S OUT AS SOON AS WE CAN

582
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:16,947
GET HIM OUT.

583
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,208
(LAUGHTER)

584
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,211
>> GOT IT!

585
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:35,799
>> GO, GO, GO!

586
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,176
>> WHEN I LOOKED AT THE THREE

587
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,469
DIFFERENT TRIBES, MY TRIBE IS

588
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,096
THE ONE I WOULD HAVE PICKED.

589
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,806
I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD

590
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,100
MIX OF BRAINS AND BRAWN.

591
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,935
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

592
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,353
SAID MAYBE YOU SHOULD NEVER PLAY

593
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,438
AGAIN BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE OPENING

594
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,774
YOURSELF UP TO THAT-- THE LEGEND

595
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,444
OF WHAT I WAS TO WHAT I AM

596
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:55,777
TODAY.

597
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,195
SO IT'S A HUGE RISK.

598
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,113
BUT IT'S WHAT DRIVES ME.

599
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:02,993
>> CLEAR BACK THERE?

600
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,201
CLEAR?

601
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,453
>> I THINK THAT WE SHOULD MAYBE

602
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,246
BE AROUND HERE, WHAT DO YOU

603
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,623
THINK?

604
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,999
>> I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT I THINK

605
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,166
BUT.

606
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,250
>> I THINK AROUND HERE IS

607
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:10,459
BETTER.

608
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,586
>> I'M DEFINITELY AN ALL OR

609
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,004
NOTHING TYPE GIRL AND I'M HERE

610
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,339
TO PLAY THE GAME NO MATTER WHAT.

611
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,758
I DEFINITELY CLICKED WITH

612
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,425
CERTAIN PEOPLE.

613
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,886
ABI IS FANTASTIC AND I TRUST

614
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:21,053
HER.

615
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,138
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO

616
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:23,972
TRUST EVERYBODY IN THIS GAME BUT

617
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,515
YOU HAVE TO TRUST SOMEBODY.

618
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,434
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE ON THE SAME

619
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,060
TRIBE WITH ME.

620
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:28,602
>> I KNOW!

621
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,020
I WAS TELLING EVERYONE THAT

622
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,188
YOU'RE THE SEXY LIBRARIAN.

623
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,314
WHAT DO YOU DO IN NEW YORK?

624
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,232
>> I'M AN EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT.

625
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:34,650
>> I USED TO BE ONE!

626
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,444
>> I'M TELLING PEOPLE I'M AN

627
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,028
EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT BECAUSE I

628
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,321
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW I'M A

629
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,739
BANKER.

630
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,199
THERE'S SUCH A NEGATIVE

631
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,241
CONNOTATION ABOUT BANKERS AND

632
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,910
WALL STREET BUT TO BE A GREAT

633
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:45,827
INVESTMENT BANKER YOU HAVE TO

634
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,411
HAVE THE KILLER INSTINCT.

635
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,288
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ON

636
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,331
YOUR TOES IN NEW YORK, HAILING A

637
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,501
CAB IN THE RAIN IN SIX-INCH

638
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:52,668
HEELS.

639
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,335
SO IF I CAN HANDLE WALL STREET I

640
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,880
CAN CERTAINLY HANDLE "SURVIVOR."

641
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,507
>> WHO SHOULD WE BRING IN OUR

642
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:58,757
ALLIANCE.

643
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,842
>> I LIKE SKUPIN.

644
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,635
>> SKUPIN?

645
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,136
>> HE'S DONE THIS BEFORE.

646
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,595
>> YEAH, HIM FOR SURE.

647
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:03,804
YEAH.

648
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,304
BUT WHO ELSE?

649
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,515
I REALLY THINK THAT PETER'S

650
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,642
STRONG AND HE'S A LITTLE BIT--

651
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,351
>> DUMB?

652
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,311
>> (LAUGHS)

653
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:11,853
YEAH, WE SHOULD HAVE HIM.

654
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,772
YOU AND I FOR SURE.

655
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,731
>> WE COULD WIN TOGETHER.

656
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,942
>> TOGETHER.

657
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,527
>> ABI AND I JUST CONNECT ON A

658
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,987
GOOD LEVEL AND SO HOPEFULLY THAT

659
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,738
CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

660
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,114
GAME.

661
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,950
BUT WHO KNOWS HOW LONG IT WILL

662
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:25,158
LAST.

663
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,077
>> OKAY, WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

664
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,286
>> I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES

665
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,579
ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO.

666
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,874
I HAVE A VERY STRONG BRAZILIAN

667
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,083
ACCENT.

668
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,294
>> CAN YOU CUT THIS IN HALF FOR

669
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,212
ME, PLEASE?

670
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:39,965
HOPEFULLY I CAN USE IT AS A

671
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:40,966
FLIRTATIOUS TOOL.

672
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,343
MAYBE MY ASS IS TOO BIG.

673
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,138
YEAH, I THINK IT IS!

674
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,140
MY BIG BRAZILIAN BOOTY.

675
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,225
>> ABI KEEPS STARING AT ME AND I

676
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,476
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG

677
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:51,727
ADVANTAGE.

678
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,979
SHE DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE SHE'S

679
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,439
READY TO PLAY SOME EVIL GAMES.

680
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,773
SHE'S PRETTY HOT.

681
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,401
SHE COULD DEFINITELY DO SOME

682
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,610
DAMAGE.

683
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,448
>> SO THAT'S IT.

684
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,365
>> I JUST LIKE-- I DON'T TRUST

685
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,702
THE OLDER LADY AND-- LET'S GO

686
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,578
BACK UP SO THEY DON'T GET

687
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:09,786
CURIOUS.

688
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,582
>> IT'S DAY ONE, ME AND ABI AND

689
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,083
PETE, WE ALREADY HAVE AN

690
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,501
ALLIANCE AND I THINK IT'S A

691
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,461
PRETTY SOLID ALLIANCE.

692
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,254
BUT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS A

693
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,923
STRONG FOUR SO WE'VE GOT THE

694
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:22,174
MAJORITY.

695
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,508
I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE SHOW AND I

696
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,511
REALLY DO THINK THAT WE CAN'T

697
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,305
LOSE WITH YOU ON OUR TEAM AND I

698
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,598
DON'T THINK WE CAN LOSE WITH YOU

699
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,184
IN AN ALLIANCE.

700
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:36,188
SO WE WERE THINKING ABI, PETE,

701
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:36,813
ME AND YOU.

702
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,024
>> WE MIGHT AS WELL START

703
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,025
SOMEWHERE, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A

704
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,526
GOOD PLACE TO START.

705
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,737
MY STRATEGY COMING INTO THIS WAS

706
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,114
MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO WITH THE

707
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:46,281
GAME.

708
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,075
IF YOUR TRIBE IS MOVING SLOW, GO

709
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:48,742
SLOW WITH THEM.

710
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,410
DON'T BE THE PERSON THAT JUST

711
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,369
JUMPS OUT IN THE LEAD.

712
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,954
>> I THINK YOU'RE FANTASTIC.

713
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:53,413
>> THANKS.

714
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,416
>> GOOD, I'M GLAD I'M ON YOUR

715
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:56,625
SIDE.

716
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,542
>> THIS IS A LITTLE BIT FOREIGN

717
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,420
TO ME, THE THREE-MAN ALLIANCE.

718
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,923
BUT THE THREE YOUNGER PEOPLE

719
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,007
MOVE FAST.

720
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,510
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO MOVE FAST

721
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,595
WITH THEM OR I'M IN BIG TROUBLE.

722
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,446
GROUND, TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT IT,

723
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,782
SEE IF YOU'VE GOT SPIDERS OR

724
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,408
SCORPIONS OR ANTS ON IT.

725
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,952
IN TEXAS, EVERYTHING BITES.

726
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,829
>> WHAT PART OF TEXAS ARE YOU

727
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:33,995
FROM?

728
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,207
>> RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

729
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:37,457
AUSTIN.

730
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,417
>> AUSTIN'S NOT SO BAD.

731
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,961
>> I GOT A RANCH DOWN SOUTH,

732
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,087
SOUTH OF SAN ANTONIO.

733
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,548
>> YOU'LL BE QUITE THE USEFUL

734
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,049
FELLOW AROUND HERE.

735
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,759
>> COMING INTO THE GROUP AND

736
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,010
LOOKING AROUND AT THE REST OF

737
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,431
THEM I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER

738
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,016
TATTED UP PEOPLE WITH SPIKEY

739
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,183
HAIR.

740
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,768
>> I SHOOT WITH A BOW.

741
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,520
>> HE'S FROM THE SOUTH.

742
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:58,937
I'M FROM THE SOUTH.

743
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,522
HE HAS A RANCH AND I GREW UP

744
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,607
RIDING FOUR WHEELERS, FISHING.

745
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,026
I'D FIGHT ANY BOY IN THE TRAILER

746
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,403
PARK THAT WOULD EVER CHALLENGE

747
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:06,570
ME.

748
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,654
HERE, I'LL TAKE OVER FOR A

749
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:07,863
MINUTE.

750
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,698
MAYBE ME AND JEFF CAN PULL SOME

751
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,117
SOUTHERN ROOTS TOGETHER AND BOND

752
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,702
ON THAT.

753
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,536
>> MIKE, HAND ME THAT-- CAN YOU

754
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,997
HAND ME THE ONE YOU THREW AWAY

755
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,789
FOR A HAMMER?

756
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,668
>> YEAH.

757
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,712
>> BEING A BASEBALL PLAYER COULD

758
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,297
BE A DISADVANTAGE TO ME.

759
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,756
THERE'S A LOT OF BAGGAGE THAT

760
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,674
GOES ALONG WITH IT.

761
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,050
YOU MADE MONEY SO YOU DON'T NEED

762
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:29,551
THE MONEY.

763
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,386
BUT THIS GAME IS NOT ABOUT WHO

764
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,721
DESERVES A MILLION BUCKS BECAUSE

765
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,513
YOU'RE IN DEBT OR DON'T HAVE A

766
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,265
LOT OF MONEY.

767
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,309
>> YOU GOT IT, JEFF!

768
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,727
>> COME ON!

769
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,686
>> I'VE BEEN A FAN OF THE SHOW

770
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,563
FOR A LONG TIME AND I WANT TO

771
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:41,897
PLAY THE GAME.

772
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,689
I'VE BEEN OUT OF BASEBALL FOR

773
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,275
FOUR YEARS NOW AND I LOVE TO

774
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:45,525
COMPETE.

775
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,151
I DON'T NEED THE MILLION BUCKS,

776
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,654
BUT I'D SURE LIKE TO BE THE SOLE

777
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:49,905
SURVIVOR.

778
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,324
ARE YOU A FAN OF THE SHOW?

779
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,201
>> I AM A FAN OF "SURVIVOR."

780
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,620
>> I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE YOU

781
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,537
SITTING AROUND ON YOUR RANCH

782
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,080
WATCHING "SURVIVOR."

783
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,916
>> WELL, IT WAS KIND OF A DARE

784
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,751
FROM A BUDDY OF MINE.

785
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,420
THEY HAD AN AUDITION IN AUSTIN

786
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,922
SO I SENT IN A MOTOCROSS TAPE.

787
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,632
>> TELL US ABOUT YOUR MOW TOE

788
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:08,840
CROSS.

789
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,926
>> I USED TO SPEND TIME WITH A

790
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,222
GUY WHO WAS REALLY INTO BASEBALL

791
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,974
AND I KNOW WHO JEFF KENT IS.

792
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,101
BUT THERE'S BEEN NO MENTION OF

793
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,312
HIM BEING A FORMER PROFESSIONAL

794
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,813
ATHLETE WHO'S MADE PROBABLY $30

795
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,648
MILLION IN HIS CAREER.

796
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,609
>> WELL, I'M NOT ONE OF THE PRO

797
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:27,817
GUYS.

798
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,278
I DON'T MAKE MONEY RACING

799
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,488
BIKING, IT'S A HOBBY.

800
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,532
HOW I MAKE MY MONEY IS SELLING

801
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:34,824
MOTORCYCLES.

802
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,076
>> I DON'T THINK THE OTHER TRIBE

803
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,160
MEMBERS KNOW AND I THINK JEFF

804
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,912
LIKES IT THAT WAY.

805
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,414
BUT I WILL TELL HIM THAT I KNOW.

806
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:47,629
AS SOON AS IT BACKS VALUABLE TO

807
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:57,764
ME.

808
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,433
>> YOU'RE GETTING YOUR PANTS

809
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:00,600
WET.

810
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,142
>> THAT'S OKAY.

811
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:01,893
>> TAKE IT OFF.

812
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,687
>> I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT OFF!

813
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,941
>> MAKE HER GET NAKED!

814
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:08,191
(LAUGHTER)

815
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:08,775
>> I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OH, I

816
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,944
WOULD SO LOVE TO BE ON

817
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:11,236
"SURVIVOR."

818
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:11,861
NOT ONLY HAVE I EVER NOT MISSED

819
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,282
A SEASON, I'VE NEVER MISSED A

820
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:15,490
SHOW.

821
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,283
YOU'RE FROM TEXAS?

822
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:16,741
>> BORN AND A RAISED.

823
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,785
>> I DON'T PLAN TO VOLUNTEER

824
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,078
THAT I WAS ON A TELEVISION

825
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:20,745
SERIES BECAUSE NOBODY WILL GIVE

826
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,956
ME A MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE

827
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,832
THEY FEEL LIKE I'VE ALREADY HAD

828
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,209
MY 15 MINUTES OF FAME.

829
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,419
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE WHAT

830
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,255
IT TAKES TO PLAY THE GAME IN A

831
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,173
CUTTHROAT WAY SO I HAVE TO PLAY

832
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:32,966
TO MY STRENGTH.

833
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,426
I'M TRYING TO CONNECT WITH EACH

834
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:38,847
PERSON ON A ONE-ON-ONE BASIS.

835
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,349
>> I ACTUALLY HAVE A MINISTRY

836
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,184
FOR MOMS SO I WRITE BOOKS AND GO

837
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,811
AND SPEAK TO GROUPS OF MOMS OF

838
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,895
YOUNG CHILDREN AND ENCOURAGE

839
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:46,104
THEM.

840
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:46,938
>> HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING

841
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:47,188
THIS FOR?

842
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,190
>> ABOUT TEN YEARS.

843
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,859
>> WOW.

844
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,736
>> WE FILMED THE LAST EPISODE OF

845
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,821
"THE FACTS OF LIFE" IN MARCH OF

846
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,158
'88, I GOT MARRIED IN JULY OF

847
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:58,700
'88 AND I LEFT THAT BEHIND.

848
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,328
I LOST THE MONEY I MADE ON "THE

849
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,454
FACTS OF LIFE."

850
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,289
I HAD A BUNCH OF MONEY INVESTED,

851
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,915
A LOT OF IT KIND OF WENT THE WAY

852
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,752
OF THE '80s CRASH AND THAT IS

853
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,838
JUST-- HAS HAUNTED ME FOR 20

854
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,422
YEARS.

855
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,175
>> FIRE, WATER, SHELTER.

856
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:15,884
WHO KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A FIRE?

857
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,762
>> I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

858
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,888
BEING ON "SURVIVOR" AT THIS

859
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,641
SEASON OF MY LIFE IS A GOD SEND

860
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,268
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN RUNNING AND

861
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,978
RUNNING FROM THE TIME I WAS A

862
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,356
LITTLE KID TO SLOW DOWN AND GO

863
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,776
INSIDE AND TO FIND OUT, OKAY,

864
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,860
WHAT-- WHO AM I?

865
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,237
AM I MORE THAN A MOM?

866
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,323
AM I MORE THAN A CHILD STAR?

867
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,699
>> I THINK SHE'S GETTING THE

868
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,116
FIRE GOING.

869
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,993
>> I HOPE SHE GETS IT.

870
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,870
>> SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE GAME

871
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,330
BECAUSE I LOVE THE GAME.

872
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,706
BUT ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL I'M

873
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,708
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S

874
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,087
GOING TO CHANGE INSIDE ME.

875
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,880
>> LISA, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE--

876
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:54,839
YOU WANT TO COME WITH?

877
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,925
>> WELL, I DON'T MIND KEEPING

878
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,301
WORKING ON THE FIRE.

879
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,719
IF YOU WANT ME TO COME WITH YOU,

880
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,428
I WILL.

881
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,138
>> IF YOU GET A FIRE GOING,

882
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:02,806
YOU'RE THE QUEEN.

883
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,391
>> I WILL KEEP WORKING ON IT.

884
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:04,933
>> LISA IS LIKE THIS VERY

885
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,018
BEAUTIFUL OLDER WOMAN AND IT'S

886
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:07,936
LIKE SHE DOESN'T HANG OUT WITH

887
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,939
US AND THEN SHE'LL GO OFF ON HER

888
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,314
OWN.

889
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:11,940
SO I THINK IT'S HARD TO TRUST

890
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,275
LISA AND I THINK IT'S EASY TO

891
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,277
SORT OF MAKE HER A SCAPEGOAT.

892
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,612
I DON'T TRUST HER.

893
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,822
I THINK SHE SAYS THINGS TO SORT

894
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,448
OF, LIKE, PUT YOU OFF AND MAKE

895
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,032
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU REALLY LIKE

896
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,784
HER AND SHE'S LIKE JUST HERE TO

897
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,911
SMILE AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.

898
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,745
BUT SHE'S A SMART PLAYER.

899
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,331
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE LISA AT

900
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:28,498
ALL.

901
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,959
>> LISA'S WAY FAMOUS.

902
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,753
LIKE, WORLDWIDE FAMOUS.

903
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,880
LIKE HER SHOW WAS ON EVERYDAY

904
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,923
FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS

905
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,800
AND YEARS AND SHE SHOULD BE

906
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,052
PLAYING THAT TRUMP CARD BECAUSE

907
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,303
YOUNG IMPRESSIONABLE PEOPLE

908
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,931
MIGHT BE, WOW, I'M KIND OF WOW.

909
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,891
BUT MAYBE HER SHOW WAS SO OLD

910
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,519
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO SHE

911
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,103
IS ANYWAYS EVEN IF SHE TOLD

912
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:50,311
THEM.

913
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,730
>> FOUR OF US DEFINITELY.

914
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,231
>> YES.

915
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,941
>> WE NEED AN ALLIANCE NAME.

916
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,443
(LAUGHS)

917
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,319
>> I DON'T KNOW HER STRATEGY

918
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,572
FULLY FOR NOT REVEALING WHO SHE

919
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:08,413
IS BUT I WANT TO!

920
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,834
>> I RECOGNIZED YOU INSTANTLY.

921
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:17,464
>> YEAH, OKAY, GOOD.

922
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,911
>> I'D LOVE LISA TO STAY BECAUSE

923
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,413
I MORE FROM AN AGE STANDPOINT

924
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,583
FIT WITH HER AND I'M SORT OF

925
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,919
WAITING FOR HER TO START

926
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,171
PLAYING, TO START BONDING.

927
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,464
HER NAME COMES UP IN A

928
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,423
DISCUSSION OF WHO DO YOU WANT TO

929
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,591
BE VOTED OUT FIRST.

930
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,133
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE HER.

931
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,052
BUT IF I'M GOING TO GET WITH THE

932
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,720
TEAM THAT'S PLAYING THE GAME

933
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:08,056
I'VE GOT TO GO WITH THE GAME.

934
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:13,811
AS OPPOSED TO YOUR HEART.

935
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,404
>> WHERE DID YOU SAY YOU WERE

936
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:23,571
FROM?

937
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,030
>> VIRGINIA.

938
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:24,322
>> VIRGINIA?

939
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,740
>> YES, MA'AM!

940
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:26,366
I WAS ALWAYS THE KIND OF PERSON

941
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,867
THAT SCHOOL DIDN'T MAKE A WHOLE

942
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,868
LOT OF SENSE TO ME.

943
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,869
IF I WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING

944
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,913
FOR EIGHT HOURS A DAY I WANTED

945
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,790
TO GET PAID, YOU KNOW WHAT I

946
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:33,998
MEAN?

947
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,917
I DROPPED OUT WHEN I WAS ABOUT

948
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,629
17 AND I WENT TO WORK AT A

949
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:39,921
JUNKYARD.

950
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,673
>> I'M GLAD YOU'RE IN MY TRIBE

951
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,257
BECAUSE I WAS REALLY CURIOUS

952
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,174
ABOUT YOU.

953
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,426
>> I'M A LICENSED SEX THERAPIST.

954
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,928
BEING A THERAPIST, I'M CURIOUS

955
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,513
ABOUT ZANE BECAUSE AT FIRST YOU

956
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,973
GO, GOD, THIS GUY IS TROUBLE BUT

957
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,975
THEN YOU LOOK CLOSER AND YOU GO,

958
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,059
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE, LOOK CLOSER

959
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:53,935
AT THOSE TATTOOS.

960
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,020
HE'S LOST SOMEBODY, THERE'S A

961
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,147
DEATH DATE OF SOMEBODY ON HIS

962
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,941
ARM AND HE'S GOT THE SERENITY

963
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,235
PRAYER ON HIS HANDS SO PART OF

964
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,529
ME IS KIND OF HOPING, THIS GUY'S

965
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,446
GOT SOME STORY.

966
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,115
IF NOTHING ELSE, I'M CURIOUS

967
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:07,782
ABOUT HIS STORY.

968
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:08,908
>> HEY, AND YOU KNOW, IT AIN'T

969
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,411
TOO EARLY TO MAKE ALLIANCES.

970
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,120
>> I LIKE YOU.

971
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,371
>> I LIKE YOU ALREADY.

972
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,080
>> I LIKE YOU ALREADY, AND I

973
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,917
WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR

974
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:18,126
TATS.

975
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,002
I LIKE IT, ZANE.

976
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,129
I THINK WE'VE GOT A PLAN.

977
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,130
>> NICE TO KNOW YOU'RE IN THE

978
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,256
CORNER.

979
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,841

BUT ALL THE JOBS I'VE HAD, IT

983
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,305
GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO

00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,417
>> YES, YES, I AM.

1002
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,376
ZANE'S INTERESTING.

1003
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,336
ZANE'S THE GUY THAT I DIDN'T

1004
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,795
THINK THAT WOULD BE MY FAVORITE.

1005
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,380
BUT I FEEL LIKE ZANE'S PRETTY

1006
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,299
HONEST WHEN HE'S WITH ME BUT

1007
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,092
ZANE COULD JUST BE A REALLY GOOD

1008
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,553
PEOPLE PERSON!

1009
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,138
HOW ARE WE DOING ON ALLIANCES?

1010
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,056
>> I HAVEN'T FORMED ANY, HAVE

1011
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,098
YOU?

1012
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,141
>> NO, I HAVEN'T.

1013
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,184
>> WELL, I LIKE YOU.

1014
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:16,517
>> ALL RIGHT!

1015
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,811
>> I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE THAT.

1016
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,979
>> YOU JUST KEEP ME RIGHT THERE

1017
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,564
AND I'LL KEEP YOU, OKAY?

1018
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,566
>> I GOT YOU IF YOU GOT ME,

1019
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:23,900
OKAY?

1020
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:24,525
>> I GOT YOU.

1021
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,985
>> HEY, WHILE WE'RE OVER HERE BY

1022
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,028
OURSELVES I THINK AN ALLIANCE

1023
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,238
NEEDS TO STAY RIGHT HERE.

1024
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,615
WE'RE THE STRONGEST, YOU KNOW

1025
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,115
WHAT I MEAN?

1026
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,950
IF THERE'S ANY WEAK TIES I DON'T

1027
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:33,910
THINK IT SHOULD BE THE THREE OF

1028
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:34,285
US FIRST.

1029
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,995
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW SO YOU KNOW

1030
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,996
I'M NOT COMING FROM LEFT FIELD

1031
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,498
AND TRYING TO VOODOO YOU.

1032
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,832
I'VE GRABBED ALLIANCES WITH ALL

1033
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,500
OF THEM.

1034
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,168
SO IT'S EASY FOR ME TO TAKE ANY

1035
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,544
ONE OF THEM IN IF YOU WANT TO.

1036
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,170
>> OKAY, I LIKE THIS THREE.

1037
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,046
>> I LIKE THIS THREE.

1038
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,590
>> I'M NOT DOING THAT FLIP-FLOP

1039
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:47,799
THING.

1040
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,175
>> I'M NOT NEITHER, OKAY?

1041
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,635
>> THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT.

1042
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,594
>> I'M IN.

1043
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,011
>> COOL.

1044
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,012
>> HEY, YOU GOT EXPERIENCE AND

1045
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:57,725
HE'S A BAR TENDER FROM GEORGIA.

1046
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:57,975
(LAUGHTER)

1047
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,060
I'M ALREADY A SUPERSTAR.

1048
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,144
MADE ALLIANCES WITH EVERYBODY ON

1049
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,814
THE TRIBE AND EVERYBODY SEEMS TO

1050
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,817
THINK THAT I'M THEIR ONLY

1051
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,067
ALLIANCE.

1052
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,151
>> THAT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY.

1053
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,487
THAT SAVES MY LIFE.

1054
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,489
>> IT'S UP TO ME NOW TO PICK

1055
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,156
THEM APART.

1056
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,616
WHOEVER I'M READY TO SEND HOME

1057
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,784
AFTER THIS FIRST CHALLENGE,

1058
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,202
THAT'S THE END OF IT, YOU KNOW?

1059
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,246
I MEAN IT'S JUST PECKING ORDER.

1060
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,165
>> ZANE CAME UP TO ME AND

1061
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,333
RUSSELL AT THE FIRE AND THE

1062
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,711
FIRST THING HE SAYS IS "I'VE

1063
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,003
ALREADY GOTTEN A ALLIANCE WITH

1064
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:26,295
EVERYBODY."

1065
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,714
>> I THINK HE'S BRIGHTER THAN WE

1066
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:27,922
BELIEVE.

1067
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:28,715
>> I'M SURE HE IS.

1068
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,257
>> THERE'S A STORY THERE.

1069
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,258
>> THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON.

1070
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,010
>> ZANE WALKED UP AND SAYS

1071
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,220
"LISTEN, I MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH

1072
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,179
EVERYBODY ON THE THIS BEACH."

1073
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,724
WELL, NOW I FEEL SPECIAL, THANKS

1074
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,851
FOR COMING TO ME LAST.

1075
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,228
DENICE IS A THERAPIST IN REAL

1076
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:42,687
LIFE.

1077
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,814
SHE'S PRACTICED AT KEEPING HER

1078
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,440
EMOTIONS OUT OF SITUATIONS AND

1079
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,650
REALLY DRAWING THEM OUT OF

1080
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,192
OTHERS AND IF SHE'S A GOOD

1081
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,445
PERSON TO HAVE AROUND FOR ME TO

1082
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:50,737
SCHEME WITH.

1083
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,030
SO IT COULD END UP BEING AN

1084
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,198
ALLIANCE THAT I END UP STAYING

1085
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,450
WITH FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

1086
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,993
>> HAVE YOU THOUGHT LONG TERM?

1087
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,203
>> I MEAN, NOT SUPER LONG TERM

1088
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,079
BUT I KNOW THAT I DON'T WANT TO

1089
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,373
BE SITTING IN RUSSELL SWAN'S

1090
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,166
SHADOW FOR A LONG TIME.

1091
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,167
>> NO, NO.

1092
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,252
>> AND IT'S GOING TO BE US TWO.

1093
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:06,461
WE COOL?

1094
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:10,673
>> I-- I JUST HAD THIS GUT

1095
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,758
INSTINCT ABOUT MALCOLM.

1096
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,134
HE'S YOUNG BY WISE AND INSTANTLY

1097
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,470
WE JUST CLICKED.

1098
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,929
AND IT WAS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU

1099
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:17,138
FEELING?

1100
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,097
HERE'S WHAT I'M FEELING.

1101
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,475
SO AS LONG AS MY ALLIANCE WITH

1102
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,727
MALCOLM HOLDS.

1103
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:22,977
I'M GOOD.

1104
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,771
>> WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS, THIS

1105
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,855
IS GOING TO BE OUR CELEBRATION.

1106
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,155
>> ROOF.

1107
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,656
ONCE WE GET THE ROOF WE CAN

1108
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,284
ALWAYS GET OUT OF ANYTHING.

1109
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,160
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE

1110
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,203
LEVEL OF PROGRESS SO FAR BECAUSE

1111
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,621
WE DON'T HAVE A FIRE WHICH MEANS

1112
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,456
WE DON'T HAVE WATER AND IT'S

1113
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,166
BEEN RAINING SINCE THE CRACK OF

1114
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:45,333
DAWN.

1115
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,293
SO I KNEW I NEEDED TO TAKE A

1116
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,671
REAL STRONG LEADERSHIP ROLE HERE

1117
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:55,676
RIGHT NOW AND SAY LET'S GET ON

1118
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:55,843
THIS.

1119
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,220
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

1120
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,096
>> I SHOULD HAVE SAW THAT

1121
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,642
COMING.

1122
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,309
IT'S JUST A BLISTER.

1123
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,519
IT'S NOTHING.

1124
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,395
>> TAKE CARE OF THAT, KEEP IT

1125
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:06,604
CLEAN.

1126
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,147
WE NEED YOU.

1127
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,149
I THINK SKUPIN GIVES 110%

1128
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,777
CONSTANTLY BUT BY DOING THAT HE

1129
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,070
MISSES THE LITTLE STUFF LIKE A

1130
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,490
TWIG OR A BAMBOO SHOOT THAT'S

1131
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,283
GOING TO HIT YOU IN THE HEAD.

1132
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,702
>> INSIDE OR OUTSIDE.

1133
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,330
>> I THINK IT'S JUST A SCRAPE.

1134
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,331
IT DOESN'T HURT.

1135
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:25,873
INJURED ON THE SECOND DAY.

1136
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,166
>> IT'S MORE UNDERSTANDING WHAT

1137
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,459
HAPPENED ON THE OUTBACK AND HIM

1138
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,544
FALLING INTO THE FIRE NOW.

1139
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,087
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT

1140
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:31,379
INJURIES.

1141
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,213
>> THESE ARE LITTLE THINGS.

1142
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,006
>> I KNOW BUT LITTLE THINGS CAN

1143
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,092
TURN INTO BIG THINGS.

1144
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,218
I THINK HE THINKS HE'S SUPERMAN.

1145
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:37,885
SUPERMAN NEEDS TO TAKE A LITTLE

1146
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,386
BIT OF A BREAK.

1147
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,180
AND MAYBE, YOU KNOW, TAKE THE

1148
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,098
MACHETE AWAY FROM HIP.

1149
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:49,397
MAYBE THAT'S HIS KRYPTONITE.

1150
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,107
YOU OKAY?

1151
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,942
>> I HAVE A CUT ON MY FOOT.

1152
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,026
>> COME ON, MIKE!

1153
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,820
THAT'S NOT A BABY CUT, EITHER.

1154
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:56,988
>> ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP?

1155
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:57,280
>> NO.

1156
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,199
I'M CUT, I GOT RIPPED SKIN.

1157
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,995
I-- I CHOPPED MY HEAD OFF.

1158
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,997
>> IS THAT FINGER, FOOT, HEAD

1159
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,163
NOW?

1160
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,333
>> (LAUGHS)

1161
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,960
BUT I'M NOT ACCIDENT PRONE, IT'S

1162
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,253
THE WAY THAT I GO THROUGH LIFE,

1163
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,714
ACT FIRST, THINK SECOND.

1164
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,842
NOTHING IS ANYWHERE NEAR AN

1165
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:18,050
ISSUE.

1166
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,636
I'M STILL GOOD.

1167
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,345
WE DIDN'T HAVE COCONUTS IN THE

1168
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:21,596
OUTBACK.

1169
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,682
THIS IS A NEW ADVENTURE FOR ME.

1170
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:24,891
OUCH!

1171
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,017
DAMN IT!

1172
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,810
>> LET'S GET YOU SOME WATER.

1173
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,396
>> IT'S A SMALL CUT.

1174
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:30,646
>> MIKE--

1175
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,272
>> LOOK, LOOK.

1176
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,691
>> OKAY, LIKE I SAY, EVERYTHING

1177
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,817
ON YOU IS A SMALL CUT.

1178
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,110
>> EVERYTHING HAS BEEN.

1179
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:37,778
>> MIKE'S A COMPLETES ME.

1180
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,446
IT'S NOT FUNNY THAT HE GETS HURT

1181
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,865
BUT IT'S FUNNY THAT IT HAPPENS

1182
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:41,407
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

1183
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,993
>> I'M ABOUT READY TO BAN YOU

1184
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,036
FROM USING THE KNIFE ANYMORE.

1185
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,621
>> I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN IN

1186
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,331
ANY SITUATIONS WHERE HE CAN

1187
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,957
SERIOUSLY GET INJURED BUT, I

1188
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,334
MEAN, WE'LL SEE WHEN WE HAVE

1189
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,084
FIRE WHAT HAPPENS.

1190
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,171
(LAUGHS)

1191
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,025
>> WELL, I ALREADY DON'T LIKE

1192
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,860
THE SHADY STUFF THAT'S GOING

1193
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,486
AROUND WITH JONATHAN.

1194
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,363
I MEAN, WE ALL STICK TOGETHER.

1195
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,405
WE'RE LIKE A FAMILY.

1196
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,365
AND HE'S JUST OFF DOING HIS OWN

1197
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:26,202
THING AND I FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOT

1198
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:26,410
UNITY.

1199
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:32,333
SO HE'S DANGEROUS.

1200
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,169
>> I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE

1201
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:36,420
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL ALL DAY.

1202
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,421
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT ALL THE

1203
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,965
OBVIOUS PLACES THAT I THINK IT

1204
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:39,465
COULD BE.

1205
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,926
THERE'S THE TREE WITH THE ARCH.

1206
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,555
THERE'S THE TREE IN THE WATER.

1207
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,726
NOWHERE.

1208
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,102
NOWHERE'SVILLE.

1209
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,103
THEN I SAY OF COURSE, IT'S IN

1210
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,729
THE CAMP RIGHT NOW.

1211
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,106
BURIED IN THE DIRT OR ATTACHED

1212
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:55,856
UNDERNEATH OR SOMETHING LIKE

1213
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,023
THAT.

1214
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:56,983
THEN I REMEMBER THE ONE THING

1215
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:57,566
THAT I WAS WAITING FOR US WHEN

1216
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,945
WE FIRST HIT THE BEACH WAS A

1217
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,113
MACHETE AND A POT WHICH YOU

1218
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,115
ALWAYS HAVE, BUT THERE WAS ALSO

1219
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,449
THIS BEAUTIFUL BOX WITH A BIG

1220
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,617
BAG OF RICE.

1221
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,452
IT'S IN THE RICE.

1222
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:17,378
IT HAS TO BE!

1223
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,295
HA HA!

1224
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,422
FIND IT, FIND THE CLUE!

1225
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,007
AN IDOL LAYS IN WAITING

1226
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:21,382
SOMEWHERE NEAR

1227
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,633
THE BEACH.

1228
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,384
IT COULD BE SALVATION AND IT'S

1229
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,721
RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE.

1230
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,306
THE IDOL IS EITHER IN THE RICE

1231
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,142
BUCKET ITSELF OR UNDERNEATH OUR

1232
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:31,350
CAMP.

1233
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:31,892
IT'S THERE, WAITING FOR ME.

1234
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:41,152
BUT I NEED TO FIND THE THING!

1235
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,195
TELL US ABOUT THE RICE, LIKE DO

1236
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:43,404
YOU--

1237
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,657
>> TWO CUPS OF RICE, ONE CUP OF

1238
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:46,866
WATER.

1239
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,367
>> SO TWO COCONUT WATERS AND A--

1240
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,162
>> COCONUT RICE.

1241
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:51,871
>> OKAY.

1242
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:55,041
I LOVE RICE; RICE LOVES ME.

1243
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,043
THAT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO

1244
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:02,131
NEED THAT MUCH.

1245
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,759
I GO TO COOK THE RICE.

1246
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,510
THERE'S A PIECE OF PAPER IN

1247
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:06,719
THERE.

1248
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,763
I'M LIKE THAT'S THE CLUE!

1249
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,722
I'M GOOD!

1250
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,307
JUST HAPPENSTANCE!

1251
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:20,566
JUST HERE IS LUCK.

1252
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,944
(READING)

1253
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:24,612
>> SO I'M SWIMMING AND I SEE

1254
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,781
RUSSELL AS HE'S SHUFFLING WITH

1255
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,406
THE FIREWOOD HE'S REACHING IN

1256
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,575
HIS POCKET.

1257
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,952
>> THAT DUDE IS ON MY CASE.

1258
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,121
>> I DON'T TRUST RUSSELL NO

1259
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,206
FARTHER THAN I CAN SLING HIM.

1260
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,833
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN THIS

1261
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,250
GAME.

1262
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,170
EVERYBODY ELSE IT'S THEIR FIRST

1263
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,215
RODEO.

1264
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,549
HE'S THE ONLY ONE I'M WORRIED

1265
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:45,758
ABOUT.

1266
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,467
>> HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK

1267
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,344
FOR THE IDOL?

1268
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,221
>> DUDE, I DON'T EVEN DO THAT.

1269
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:50,763
YOU KNOW, IT'S DEFINITELY

1270
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,639
SOMETHING THAT HELPED

1271
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,516
TREMENDOUSLY BUT I'M GOING TO

1272
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,142
TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, I SEE

1273
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:55,726
SOMEBODY LOOKING FOR THE IDOL

1274
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,438
AND I CATCH THEM, TARGET.

1275
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,899
>> I POINT BLANK ASKED RUSSELL

1276
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,402
"HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR THE

1277
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:04,902
IDOL?"

1278
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,779
"NO, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR THE

1279
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:07,530
IDOL BECAUSE WE'RE TEAMMATES.

1280
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,740
IF I SEE ANYBODY LOOKING FOR IT,

1281
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,450
I'M VOTING THEM OUT."

1282
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,077
HE'S SO CALM AND CHARISMATIC IT

1283
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,078
MAKES ME BELIEVE HE'S ALREADY

1284
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:14,537
GOT IT.

1285
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,456
>> IF YOU GET IT YOU'RE GOING

1286
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,707
NEXT!

1287
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:24,547
BEST BELIEVE THAT.

1288
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:24,713
SO.

1289
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,841
>> SO IF WE LOSE FIRST CHALLENGE

1290
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,925
WE'LL GET RID OF RUSSELL.

1291
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,605
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

1292
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,827
>> Jeff: YOU GUYS READY TO GET

CHALLENGE?

1295
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,204
>> YEAH!

1296
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,205

SOON MATSING WILL BE IN HERE.

1489
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,010
YOU DON'T WANT TO FINISH LAST.

1490

LAST MEANS TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1491
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,971
THERE YOU GO.

1492
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,600

1505
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,083
TO FINISH FIRST OR FINISH SECOND

1506
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,002

PANIC IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

1515
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,309
FOCUS IS THE KEY.

1516
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,269
TANDANG CONTINUES TO EXTEND

1517
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,104

DON'T LOOK!

1527
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,410

00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,226
KALABAW FIRST TO FINISH.

00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,773
TANDANG SURVIVES WINNING

1544
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,067

>> I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT GOOD AT

1548
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,451
PUZZLES.

TRIBE.

1555
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,086
TANDANG, NOT QUITE AS BIG A

1556
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,589
REWARD BUT YOU GOT WHAT YOU

1557
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,466

00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,634
ALONG WITH IT.

1559
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,176
GOOD WORK.

1560
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,972
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR TANDANG.

1561
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,015
MATSING, WHAT HAPPENED RUSSELL?

1562
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,809
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, JEFF, ALL I

1563
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,269
CAN SAY IS AT THE END OF THE DAY

1564
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,771
I MADE THE DECISION ON WHO WAS

00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,356
GOING TO DO WHAT SO I CARRY SOME

1566
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,273

IT'S JUST-- WE ALL HAVE TO CLICK

1568
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,026
NEXT TIME.

1569
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,069
AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY, JEFF.

1570
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,655
THERE ALWAYS IS A NEXT TIME.

1571
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,073
>> Jeff: THERE'S A NEXT TIME

1572
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,074
FOR FIVE OF YOU.

1573
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,033
NOT A NEXT TIME FOR ALL SIX OF

00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,159
YOU.

1575
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,661
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT, SOMEBODY

1577
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,080
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS

1578
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:18,288
GAME.

1579
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,332
YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE

1580
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:20,957
THAT OUT.

1581
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,042
SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

1582
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,086
GRAB YOUR STUFF; HEAD BACK TO

00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,128
CAMP.

1584
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:25,754
>> Jeff: .

1585
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,089
>> RUSSELL TOOK OVER AND DIDN'T

1586
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,257
LISTEN TO A SINGLE WORD ANYBODY

1587
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,092
SAID SO I GET TO GO SEE TRIBAL

1588
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,177
ON NIGHT THREE.

1589
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,695
>> NOW YOU KNOW HOW THIS GOES.

1590
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,988
YOU SEE THESE CHALLENGES ARE

1591
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:52,239
BRUTAL.

1592
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,742
BUT I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE

1593
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,037
AND I'M TELLING YOU YOU HAVE TO

1594
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,957
DIG SO DEEP IN YOURSELF.

1595
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,250
>> CAN I SPEAK BEFORE-- AND I'D

1596
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,252
LIKE TO TALK TO THE WHOLE TRIBE,

1597
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,837
ALL RIGHT.

1598
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,713
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

1599
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,673
GAME WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO-- I

1600
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,257
MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO PULL THE

1601
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,926
FIRE OUT OF YOUR STOMACH AND

1602
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,636
DECIDE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING

1603
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,096
TO THROW DOWN.

1604
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,014
AND YOU HAD TO PULL ME.

1605
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,016
I THREW MYSELF ON TOP-- I MEAN,

1606
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,517
THREE DAYS IN, BROTHER.

1607
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,355
I AIN'T BUILT FOR IT.

1608
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,733
>> AS I'M KIND OF FINISHING THE

1609
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,276
PEP TALK, ZANE BASICALLY CUTS ME

1610
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,736
OFF AND THE GUY THROWS HIMSELF

1611
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:31,153
UNDER THE BUS.

1612
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,155
>> MY LEGS CRAMPED SO HARD THAT

1613
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:36,616
I SAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1614
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,451
Y'ALL DIDN'T.

1615
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,578
SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT IT'S A

1616
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:39,786
CHOICE.

1617
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,204
>> WHAT IT DID WAS IT MADE THE

1618
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,498
DECISION PRETTY DAMN EASY IN

1619
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,918
TERMS OF WHO'S GOING HOME

1620
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:47,127
TONIGHT.

1621
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,546
>> I LOVE THIS GAME AND I LOVE

1622
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:53,550
IT FOR KNOWING HOW POWERFUL IT

1623
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,134
IS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1624
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:59,890
BUT I DESERVE-- I DESERVE TO GO.

1625
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,266
MY WHOLE REASON WHY I'M THROWING

1626
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,185
MY NECK ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK IS

1627
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,187
TO ESTABLISH WHAT I'M RUNNING

1628
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,437
AGAINST.

1629
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,022
THIS WHOLE RUSE THAT I JUST

1630
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,566
THREW ON WAS JUST TO FILL OUT MY

1631
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,610
TRIBE EXACTLY HOW I NEED TO WORK

1632
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:11,818
THINGS.

1633
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,486
IT'S GOING TO BE WORSE AND WORSE

1634
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,572
AND WORSE.

1635
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,907
SO HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY LOVES ME

1636
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,241
TO THE POINT TO WHERE THEY WOULD

1637
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,952
RATHER HAVE ME AS A HINDRANCE

1638
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:21,912
THAN TO KEEP RUSSELL.

1639
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,455
I TOOK MY SHOT, I'M PLAYING

1640
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,831
CHESS THE BEST WAY I KNOW HOW

1641
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,333
AND HOPEFULLY I'M GOING TO KING

1642
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:30,587
ME.

1643
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,714
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO, I THINK

1644
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,341
IT'S GOING TO BE ZANE.

1645
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,759
ALL RIGHT?

1646
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:39,554
SO YOU GUYS ARE GOOD?

1647
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,890
AND-- YOU KNOW, ALL I CAN SAY IS

1648
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,141
WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR," DIG DEEP,

1649
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,268
YOU GUYS GOT IT IN YOU.

1650
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,646
>> I'M FORMER MISS UTAH TEEN.

1651
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:48,313
I'M A VERY, VERY COMPETITIVE

1652
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,439
PERSON.

1653
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,899
I NEVER LIKE TO LOSE.

1654
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,234
I'M SO ANNOYED BECAUSE RUSSELL

1655
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,443
WANTS EVERYONE TO THINK THAT

1656
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,778
HE'S NOT THE LEADER.

1657
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,072
HE'S LIKE "I'M NOT THE LEADER,

1658
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:57,280
GUYS."

1659
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,615
BUT HE MAKES THOSE CALLS LIKE IN

1660
00:51:58,698 --> 00:51:59,282
THE CHALLENGES.

1661
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,700
A LEADER WOULD LISTEN TO HIS

1662
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,201
TRIBE AND REALLY TAKE INTO

1663
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,953
CONSIDERATION WHAT THEIR

1664
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:10,335
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES ARE.

1665
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,461
I'M PISSED.

1666
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,089
I'M JUST SO BUMMED.

1667
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,174
I SAID I'M NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES,

1668
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,259
HE PUTS ME AT PUZZLES BECAUSE

1669
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,469
HE'S NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES.

1670
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,262
>> I DIDN'T LIKE THAT TACK

1671
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:20,470
TAKE--

1672
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,598
>> HE'S LIKE I'M NOT GOOD AT

1673
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,850
PUZZLES, YOU DO PUZZLES.

1674
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,977
I'M NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES, EITHER.

1675
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:27,686
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

1676
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:28,854
IF WE HAVE TO VOTE ZANE OUT I

1677
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:29,479
WOULD IF IT WOULD GET ME FURTHER

1678
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,565
IN THE GAME BUT I WOULD LIKE TO

1679
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,024
SEE RUSSELL GONE BECAUSE I LIKE

1680
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:33,233
ZANE.

1681
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:33,567
HE IS SO FUNNY.

1682
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,819
HE'S JUST LIKE-- HE'S A GOOD

1683
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:36,444
GENUINE PERSON AND I WOULD LIKE

1684
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,362
TO SEE HIM AROUND.

1685
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,698
I KNOW HE'S NOT THAT STRONG IN

1686
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:40,323
CHALLENGES BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO

1687
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:40,699
SEE HIM GIVE UP.

1688
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,450
HOW COULD YOU GIVE UP?

1689
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,326
>> I'M NOT GIVING UP.

1690
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,662
>> YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE TO VOTE

1691
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:45,912
FOR YOU.

1692
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,414
>> LOGISTICALLY HE HAD TO

1693
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,582
LITERALLY PULL ME ACROSS THE

1694
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:48,748
LINE.

1695
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,375
>> ME AND ROXANNE WANTED TO RUN

1696
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:50,750
AND GUESS WHAT?

1697
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,877
HE SAID NO.

1698
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,836
IT WAS HIM, NOT YOU.

1699
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:53,420
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR?

1700
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,963
>> I MEAN--

1701
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:55,589
>> YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR RUSSELL.

1702
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,841
>> IT'S UP TO Y'ALL, MAN.

1703
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:58,300
I AIN'T GIVING UP.

1704
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,218
I'M HERE FOR YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT

1705
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,595
I MEAN?

1706
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,596
>> STICK WITH IT.

1707
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:02,846
DON'T GO.

1708
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,014
>> ALL RIGHT.

1709
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,641
ANGIE WAS LIKE "PLEASE DON'T GO

1710
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:06,850
HOME.

1711
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,476
LET'S BLIND SIDE RUSS."

1712
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,853
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME,

1713
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:10,353
BECAUSE WE NEED YOU.

1714
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,522
WE NEED SOME LAUGHTER.

1715
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,315
>> YOU AIN'T NEVER SEEN A MOVE

1716
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:17,569
LIKE THIS IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

1717
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,362
>> ARE YOU FOR SURE TOSSING IN

1718
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,488
THE TOWEL, KID?

1719
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,907
YOU'RE NOT TOSSING IN THE TOWEL

1720
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,116
BUT-- THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYE

1721
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:23,491
SCARES ME.

1722
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,451
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.

1723
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,785
>> ARE YOU BLIND SIDING?

1724
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,412
>> I MEAN-- IF YOU WANT TO GO

1725
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:31,791
HOME, I'LL SEND YOU HOME BUT,

1726
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,960
LIKE, THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT

1727
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:34,461
WAYS THE GAME COULD GO.

1728
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,004
>> MALCOLM CAME TO ME AND BEGGED

1729
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:36,504
ME TO STAY.

1730
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,006
NOW THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO

1731
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,967
WORRY ABOUT NOW IS IF RUSS

1732
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,385
ACTUALLY HAS THE IDOL.

1733
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,428
I GIVE YOU 100% THAT HE DOES

1734
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:46,598
HAVE THE IDOL.

1735
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,099
>> ZANE WAS ALREADY GOING HOME

1736
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,894
BY HIS OWN FREE WILL BUT THE

1737
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:54,564
THING IS WE THINK RUSSELL HAS AN

1738
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:54,773
IDOL.

1739
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,107
THE SKETCHIEST PART IS THAT THE

1740
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,192
INFORMATION COMES FROM ZANE OF

1741
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,194
ALL PEOPLE THAT RUSSELL HAS AN

1742
00:53:59,277 --> 00:53:59,402
IDOL.

1743
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,404
BUT IF WE VOTE OUT RUSSELL WE'RE

1744
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,114
OBVIOUSLY DOWN MULL WISE THREE

1745
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:03,657
DAYS IN.

1746
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,075
I THINK ZANE AT ONE POINT ASKED

1747
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,494
RUSSELL TO DRAG HIM THROUGH THE

1748
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,912
COURSE.

1749
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,747
SO QUITE LITERALLY HE'S THE ONE

1750
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,706
WEIGHING THE TRIBE DOWN.

1751
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,249
HAVE YOU TALKED TO ZANE ABOUT

1752
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,584
THE IDOL AT ALL?

1753
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,168
>> NO.

1754
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,294
>> WE'RE 95% SURE RUSSELL HAD

1755
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:16,461
IT.

1756
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:17,379
>> DAMN IT!

1757
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,547
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A FEELING THAT

1758
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,174
RUSSELL HAS MAYBE FOUND AN

1759
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,467
IMMUNITY IDOL AND SO ZANE MIGHT

1760
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,177
HAVE A SHOT TO STAY.

1761
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,054
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOTHING AGAINST

1762
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,138
ZANE BUT THIS IS NOT THE POINT

1763
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:27,722
IN THE GAME WHERE YOU CAN HAVE

1764
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,975
WEAK PLAYERS.

1765
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,268
GOD, IT SUCK HAVING TO MAKE THIS

1766
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:32,519
DECISION.

1767
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,478
>> OH, MAN.

1768
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,437
I DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS.

1769
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,105
>> NO.

1770
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:38,066
LET ME TELL YOU, DUDE, THEY

1771
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:38,274
SUCK.

1772
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,235
>> I THINK I'M OKAY TONIGHT.

1773
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,487
BUT I ACTUALLY MADE MY FIRST

1774
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,279
MISTAKE TODAY.

1775
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,241
I JUST CLICKED INTO THIS KIND OF

1776
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,243
CHIEF MODE, IF YOU WILL, AND

1777
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,537
THOUGHT I HAVE TO MAKE THIS

1778
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:50,704
CALL.

1779
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,413
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

1780
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,498
THIS IS NOT ABOUT LEADERSHIP.

1781
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:54,457
LEADERSHIP KILLS, DUDE, AND I

1782
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,543
WENT RIGHT BACK INTO THE OLD

1783
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,585
MODE.

1784
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,504
YOU NEVER KNOW WITH THIS GAME.

1785
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,047
THESE PEOPLE COULD VOTE ME OUT

1786
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:06,261
TONIGHT.

1787
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,568
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS

1788
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,779
A TORCH, GRAB A TORCH, APPROACH

1789
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:31,244
THE FLAME AND GET FIRE.

1790
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,579
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

1791
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,539
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

1792
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,499
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1793
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,876
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FIRE YOU ARE

1794
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:38,543
STILL IN THIS GAME AND WHEN YOUR

1795
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,171
FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE YOU AND

1796
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,006
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE FOR

1797
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,301
ONE OF YOU TONIGHT.

1798
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:46,926
ONLY THREE DAYS IN, ZANE, AND

1799
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,594
SOMEBODY'S GOING HOME.

1800
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,554
>> IT'S A SAD THING, JEFF.

1801
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,431
BUT IT'S THE WAY OF "SURVIVOR."

1802
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,808
>> Jeff: DENICE, WHAT DO YOU

1803
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,268
THINK ABOUT HAVING RETURNING

1804
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:55,477
PLAYERS?

1805
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,519
>> YOU KNOW, QUITE HONESTLY I

1806
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,146
WAS MIXED AT FIRST BECAUSE I

1807
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,564
WANTED IT TO BE A REALLY PURE

1808
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,691
GAME KIND OF IN THE SENSE OF

1809
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,151
JUST THIS BEING OUR GAME.

1810
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,611
BUT IT'S ALREADY BEEN, YOU KNOW,

1811
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,445
AN ASSET TO HAVE SOMEBODY REALLY

1812
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,031
GIVING US TIPS ON HOW TO DO THIS

1813
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:08,615
OR HOW TO SAVE A FIRE THROUGH

1814
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,532
THREE DAYS OF RAIN.

1815
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,743
SO IT DEFINITELY CHANGES THE

1816
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,869
GAME PLAY.

1817
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,413
BUT IN THIS RAIN IT'S A GIFT.

1818
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,290
>> Jeff: ZANE, IT'S KIND OF A

1819
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,084
TRICKY DILEMMA, ISN'T IT?

1820
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:19,709
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAN BRING

1821
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,753
SOMETHING YOU NEED, EXPERIENCE.

1822
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,214
BUT GOING IN THEY'RE A BETTER

1823
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:24,672
PLAYER THAN YOU.

1824
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,341
>> OFF THE TOP THEY ARE BETTER

1825
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,175
THAN YOU ARE.

1826
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,219
IT'S KIND OF LIKE AN ONION, MAN.

1827
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,054
MORE LAYERS YOU PEEL BACK, THE

1828
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,056
MORE YOU START TO CRY.

1829
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,557
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS

1830
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:34,933
AND--

1831
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:35,558
>> Jeff: OKAY, YOU LOST ME.

1832
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:35,809
(LAUGHTER)

1833
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,728
>> I WAS NERVOUS--

1834
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:39,562
>> Jeff: WAIT, WAIT.

1835
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,189
GO BACK TO THE ONION.

1836
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,024
>> YOU KNOW, AT FIRST LIKE YOU

1837
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,150
GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT.

1838
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,527
THEN YOU GET A LITTLE BIT MORE

1839
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,362
OUT OF IT THEN YOU REALIZE

1840
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,738
YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH OUT OF

1841
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:48,905
IT.

1842
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,824
SO THE MORE LAYERS YOU PEEL, THE

1843
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,574
MORE YOU CRY, MAN.

1844
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,577
THIS GUY IS A KILLER ATHLETE.

1845
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,871
HE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT FIRE AND

1846
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,289
WATER AND SHELTER.

1847
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,542
LIKE I SAID-- THE MORE YOU PEEL

1848
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,167
BACK, THE MORE YOU UNDERSTAND

1849
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,128
HOW MUCH OF A BETTER PLAYER

1850
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,087
YOU'RE COMING AGAINST RATHER

1851
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,839
THAN BEING ON EQUAL GROUND.

1852
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:06,172
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1853
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,842
SO NOW THAT I'M CAUGHT UP THERE,

1854
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,677
RUSSELL, DOES THAT SOUND LIKE "I

1855
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,096
LOVE WHAT YOU'VE TAUGHT US BUT

1856
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,639
MAN YOU'RE TOO GOOD OF A PLAYER

1857
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:15,807
AND YOU'RE GOING"?

1858
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,516
>> YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT

1859
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,976
SOUNDS LIKE.

1860
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,978
EVEN WITH THIS ONION THING I

1861
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,688
THINK TODAY I KIND OF BLEW IT

1862
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,315
BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING 2.0 AND

1863
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,276
JUST BEING PART OF A GROUP I

1864
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,028
WENT BACK TO 1.0, THAT DICTATOR.

1865
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,530
AND I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

1866
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,699
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, DID YOU PICK

1867
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,575
UP ON RUSSELL BECOMES A

1868
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,659
DICTATOR, AS HE SAYS?

1869
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,871
>> HE CAME ON A LITTLE STRONG

1870
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:38,580
PRE-CHALLENGE TODAY.

1871
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,165
>> AND I'M--

1872
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,208
>> AND, WE ALL-- IT'S ON THE

1873
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,084
TABLE, WE ALL KNOW.

1874
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,252
>> IT WAS WRONG.

1875
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:46,921
BUT I WOULDN'T BE COMPLETELY

1876
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,423
SHOCKED IF I WAS VOTED OUT

1877
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:48,673
TONIGHT.

1878
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:49,507
>> Jeff: HOW DISAPPOINTED

1879
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,967
WOULD YOU BE?

1880
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,468
>> I MEAN, THE FIRST TIME I

1881
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,804
PLAYED I GOT CARRIED OUT ON MY

1882
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:55,013
BACK.

1883
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:55,930
I GET BLESSED WITH A SECOND

1884
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,140
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY AGAIN AND I

1885
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:57,849
GO OUT FIRST.

1886
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,225
THAT WOULD JUST BE A DAGGER IN

1887
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,768
THE HEART.

1888
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,812
>> Jeff: ROXY, DID HE COME ON

1889
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:03,188
A LITTLE STRONG?

1890
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:03,646
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1891
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,274
I FEEL LIKE OUT OF NOWHERE HE'S

1892
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,609
JUST LIKE "NO, WHOA.

1893
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,403
IT'S GOING TO BE THIS, THIS, AND

1894
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:10,612
THIS."

1895
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,237
AND I HAVE MILITARY BACKGROUND

1896
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,948
SO I JUST WENT RIGHT INTO MY

1897
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,074
GEAR WHICH IS YOU ARE SUPERIOR

1898
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,784
TO ME, THAT IS HOW YOU'RE ACTING

1899
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:17,619
RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO TAKE

1900
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:20,538
DIRECTION AND FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.

1901
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,748
>> Jeff: ANGIE, DO YOU AGREE

1902
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,166
WITH THAT?

1903
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:23,625
>> YES.

1904
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,501
YOU KNOW, I RAN TRACK IN HIGH

1905
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,753
SCHOOL, I ASKED IF I COULD RUN

1906
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,795
BUT NOPE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT

1907
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,797
TO DO THE PUZZLE AND HE TOLD ME

1908
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,716
IF WE LOSE IT'S YOUR FAULT.

1909
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,135
>> I DON'T KNOW-- I MEAN-->>

1910
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,136
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY--

1911
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,512
>> I DON'T THINK THAT WAS

1912
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,472
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

1913
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:38,056
>> Jeff: ANGIE'S PRETTY SURE

1914
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,265
IT WAS EXACTLY.

1915
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,892
>> WELL, THE BOTTOM LINE IS SHE

1916
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,310
IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

1917
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,312
I WENT INTO DICTATOR MODE AND IT

1918
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,356
WAS LIKE NOPE, THIS IS WHAT

1919
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:46,648
WE'RE DOING.

1920
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:52,487
THAT'S RIGHT.

1921
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,571
HOPEFULLY THIS DAY DOESN'T

1922
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:54,656
BESPEAK FOR THE OTHER TWO DAYS.

1923
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,615
ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNOW I HAVE SO

1924
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,201
MUCH MORE TO GIVE GIVE AND I

1925
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:58,785
HOPE I GET THAT OPPORTUNITY.

1926
00:58:58,868 --> 00:58:59,619
>> Jeff: ZANE, HOW DO YOU FEEL

1927
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,788
ABOUT THE LEG YOU WERE ASSIGNED

1928
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,330
TO DO?

1929
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,250
>> WELL, I QUIT SMOKING THE DAY

1930
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,001
OF COMING HERE.

1931
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:07,752
AND I MADE SURE I LET THE WHOLE

1932
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:10,171
TRIBE KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW,

1933
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,547
RUNNING AIN'T THE DEAL.

1934
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,674
I'M GETTING BACK BUT I AIN'T GOT

1935
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,133
BACK, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1936
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,094
I KNOW IT'S MY FAULT, I'M A

1937
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:16,427
DUMMY.

1938
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,845
I SHOULD HAVE PUT A LITTLE MORE

1939
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:18,304
FORETHOUGHT INTO THAT.

1940
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,390
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.

1941
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,724
>> Jeff: REGARDLESS WHO PUT

1942
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,935
YOU IN THAT POSITION, IS THERE

1943
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,270
RESPONSIBILITY, DENICE, HOW YOU

1944
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:25,770
PERFORM IN A CHALLENGE?

1945
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:29,148
>> I MEAN, I-- ABSOLUTELY.

1946
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:29,649
I COULD SAY I WAS A STRONG

1947
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,360
SWIMMER AND I GOT OUT THERE AND

1948
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,236
I'M PUSHING A 200 POUND CHEST

1949
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,530
AND I SUCKED, SURE, THEY COULD

1950
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:36,406
POINT THAT AT ME.

1951
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,241
OR YOU CAN TURN THAT AROUND AND

1952
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,159
GO "OR WAS THAT OUR LEADERSHIP?

1953
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,078
" IT'S PART OF THE GAME.

1954
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:42,412
>> Jeff: ZANE?

1955
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,705
>> WHEN I GOT BACK TO CAMP I

1956
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,665
TOLD EVERYBODY SEND ME HOME IF

1957
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,166
YOU WANT TO, I UNDERSTAND THE

1958
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,293
RUNNING WAS NOT MY DEAL.

1959
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:48,918
I WOULD RATHER STEP OUT OF YOUR

1960
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,837
WAY THAN THE HOLD YOU UP.

1961
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,755
>> Jeff: RUSSELL, YOU'RE OFF

1962
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,465
THE BOX.

1963
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,175
>> IT SOUNDS CONVENIENT BUT, YOU

1964
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:56,801
KNOW, JEFF, I'VE BEEN TO THIS

1965
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:59,595
DANCE BEFORE AND YOU NEVER KNOW

1966
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,680
WHAT CONVERSATIONS HAVE TAKEN

1967
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,848
PLACE FROM THAT TIME TO THAT HE

1968
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:05,643
MADE THAT PRONOUNCEMENT TO THIS

1969
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,602
TIME NOW.

1970
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,604
I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES STUFF CAN

1971
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,898
BE CODED, IT CAN CUT ALL KINDS

1972
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:11,816
OF DIFFERENT E WAYS.

1973
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,776
>> Jeff: WHAT ODDS DO YOU GIVE

1974
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,736
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE

1975
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,612
HERE AFTER THIS VOTE?

1976
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,071
>> I DON'T KNOW, JEFF.

1977
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,073
BUT I'M READY TO BE HERE.

1978
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:22,076
LET'S BE CLEAR.

1979
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,994
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1980
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,996
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1981
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,082
MALCOLM, YOU'RE UP.

1982
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:44,807
>> ZANE, I'M NOT READY TO GO

1983
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,309
HOME YET.

1984
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:49,103
I WISH YOU LOTS OF LUCK, MAN.

1985
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,698
>> IF YOU AIN'T FIRST, YOU'RE

1986
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:05,119
LAST.

1987
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:21,386
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1988
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:26,766
VOTES.

1989
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,102
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1990
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,561
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1991
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:36,943
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1992
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,404
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1993
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,571
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1994
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,614
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1995
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:42,865
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1996
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:43,866
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1997
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:44,951
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1998
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:51,582
FIRST VOTE, ZANE.

1999
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:56,254
RUSS.

2000
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:59,382
ZANE.

2001
01:01:59,465 --> 01:01:59,590
ZANE.

2002
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,010
THAT'S THREE VOTES ZANE, ONE

2003
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:03,302
VOTE RUSS.

2004
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:08,766
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF

01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:09,350
"SURVIVOR: PHILIPPINES," ZANE.

2006
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,185
THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU'VE GOT TO

2007
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,939
BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

2008
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:19,777
ZANE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

2009
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:26,159
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

2010
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:30,663
>> SON OF A BITCH!

2011
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:31,789
>> Jeff: WELL, THE GOOD NEWS

2012
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:32,999
IS YOU SURVIVED YOUR FIRST

2013
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:33,332
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2014
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,834
THE BAD NEWS IS YOU'RE ALREADY

2015
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,379
DOWN TO FIVE PEOPLE LEFT.

2016
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,005
ONE MORE THING.

2017
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,506
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN TO TRIBAL

2018
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,549
COUNCIL, YOU NOW HAVE FIRE IN

2019
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,593
THE FORM OF FLINT.

2020
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:44,802
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

2021
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:45,094
CAMP.

2022
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,847
GOOD NIGHT.
