WE ARE SWITCHING THINGS UP.

4
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,093
AFTER A SURPRISE SWITCH, KELLY

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,054
WAS THE ONLY BLUE-COLLAR MEMBER

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,639
ON AN UNDERMANNED NAGAROTE

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:14,848
TRIBE.

8
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,057
>> I AM DEFINITELY SCARED TO

9
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,183
DEATH.

10
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,436
>> Jeff: WHILE THE REST OF THE

ADVANTAGE, BUT NOT ALL OF THEM

13
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:22,689
WERE HAPPY.

14
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,107
>> I FEEL LIKE MY OLD TRIBE ARE

CRAPPY PEOPLE, BUT I HAVE THREE

16
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:26,818
NEW PEOPLE.

17
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,069
>> IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT

18
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,279
BALLGAME.

19
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:34,409
>> Jeff: BACK AT CAMP, RODNEY

20
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:34,951
GREW CLOSE.

21
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,786
>> RODNEY IS LIKE MY FRIENDS

22
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,036
BACK HOME.

23
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,290
>> I'M SO GRATEFUL YOU GUYS ARE

24
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,458
HERE.

25
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,794

TRIBE.

28

>> I WANT TO GO WHERE I'M

29
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,132
WANTED, AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S

30
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,175
WITH THE BLUE COLLARS.

31
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:54,971

>> WHO IS MORE ANNOYING?

38
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,156
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE A HORSE RACE.

39
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,783
IS IT SHIRIN?

40
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,535
NO, HERE COMES MAX WITH HIS FOOT

41
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:17,869

FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT.

45
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,248
LEAVING SHIRIN ALL ALONE.

46
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,626
MAX, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

47
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,460
13 ARE LEFT.

48
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:46,856
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

49
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,316
>> MAX WAS A FRIEND OF MINE AND

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,486
MY CLOSEST ALLY IN THIS GAME,

51
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,074
AND I WAS TOTALLY BLIND SIDED.

52
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,408
IT'S A HEARTBREAKER.

53
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,035
>> ARE YOU NOT GOING TO WORK

54
00:01:59,118 --> 00:01:59,452
WITH ME FROM NOW ON?

55
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,830
>> I DON'T KNOW, SHIRIN.

56
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,413
I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN TRUST

57
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,748
YOU.

58
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,958
EVERY SINGLE DAY THE ONLY PERSON

59
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,961
YOU EVER TALKED TO IS MAX.

60
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,921
>> MAX TALKED TO ME.

61
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,674
>> NO, SHIRIN, YOU WERE HIS

62
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,885
LITTLE PUPPET.

63
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,511
WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR THREE DAYS.

64
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,805
>> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SPEND ALL

65
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,639
MY TIME WITH HIM.

66
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,141
>> EXACTLY.

67
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:22,308
WHY?

68
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:22,725
I FELT WE WERE BUDS.

69
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,227
>> WE NEEDED NUMBERS.

70
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,187
>> WELL, WHEN I THINK LOYALTY, I

71
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,815
THINK REAL LOYALTY, NOT FAKE

72
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,065
LOYALTY.

73
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,525
>> IS ANYONE LEFT IN THIS GAME

74
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,985
WILLING THE PLAY WITH ME?

75
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:32,652
I DON'T THINK SO.

76
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,903
THAT'S A SAD REALIZATION.

77
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,487
IS THAT SOMETHING ABOUT ME AND

78
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,073
ABOUT MY PERSONALITY?

79
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:41,244
WHAT DO I HAVE TO CHANGE?

80
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,580
>> I GUESS YOU WERE KIND OF

81
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,914
SHAKEN UP BY LAST NIGHT?

82
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,707
>> YEAH.

83
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,833
I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO

84
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,417
BE WILL.

85
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,001
IT WAS HARD.

86
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,086
>> MAX DID ANNOYING THINGS THAT

87
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:50,670
WERE GETTING UNDER EVERYONE'S

88
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,546
SKIN.

89
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,381
AND THEN LIKE IF YOU WANT ME TO

90
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,383
BE STRAIGHT, THEY WERE SAYING

91
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,676
YOU DID SOME ANNOYING THINGS,

92
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:56,968
TOO.

93
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:01,264
>> IT'S REALLY HARD ME BECAUSE I

94
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,142
FIND MYSELF IN THIS GAME IN A

95
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,476
POSITION THAT'S ANALOGOUS TO

96
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,020
WHERE I GREW UP.

97
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,440
I GREW UP IN RICH ORANGE COUNTY

98
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,232
SUBURB WHERE THE MAJORITY OF MY

99
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,358
CLASSMATES WERE BEAUTIFUL AND

100
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,569
SKINNY, AND I STOOD OUT FOR NOT

101
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,613
BEING ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

102
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,656
AND I CONSTANTLY FELT LIKE I WAS

103
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,742
FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE TO LIKE ME,

104
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,451
LIKE I WAS FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE

105
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,913
TO SEE THE GOOD QUALITIES IN ME,

106
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:29,792
AND I THINK THIS PROBABLY...

107
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,419
THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF THIS

108
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:31,961
SCENARIO TAPPING INTO THAT.

109
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,255
I'M TRYING TO DO NOW WHICH I WAS

110
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,215
INCAPABLE OF DOING BACK THEN,

111
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,675
WHICH IS DEAL WITH IT, ADAPT,

112
00:03:37,759 --> 00:04:14,379
FIX IT.

113
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,964
>> IT'S FOURTH DAY, AND I HAD TO

114
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:16,422
GO DOWN TO THE WATER.

115
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,092
AND WAVE TOOK MY UNDERWEAR.

116
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,593
NO UNDERWEAR.

117
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,428
>> BANANA HAMMOCK UNDERWEAR.

118
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,430
>> IT WAS A BANANA HAMMOCK.

119
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,390
IT WAS NOT A THONG.

120
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,474
IT DID NOT GO UP MY BUTT, OKAY.

121
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,018
>> I'VE BEEN ON THESE BEACH WITH

122
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,770
THE SAME PEOPLE TELLING THE SAME

123
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,354
GARBAGE OVER AND OVER AND OVER

124
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,689
AGAIN.

125
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,815
IT'S ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE.

126
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,400
I WAS HOPING IN THE SWITCH UP I

127
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,985
COULD GET SOME NEW ENERGY, MAYBE

128
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:37,610
GET MATCHED UP WITH SOME PEOPLE

129
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,529
I KNOW ARE LIKE ME.

130
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,447
>> SICK OF BEING AROUND THE SAME

131
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,034
DAMN PEOPLE.

132
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:45,660
SAME STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

133
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,412
THAT'S WHY WE GOT TO STAY

134
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,746
TOGETHER SO WE CAN KEEP

135
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,205
OURSELVES SANE HERE.

136
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:53,376
>> I WAS SO HAPPY JOAQ WAS ONE

137
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,211
OF THOSE FACES.

138
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,462
ONE GUY IS A BIBLE BUMPER FROM

139
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,548
TEXAS, A HICK FROM MAINE,

140
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,882
ANOTHER ONE IS FROM UTAH.

141
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,509
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN WAITING

142
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,635
FOR SOME TYPE OF CONNECTION IN

143
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,344
THIS GAME, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

144
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,472
I WAS LOOKING FOR MAYBE A LITTLE

145
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,433
BROMANCE, MAYBE A HOMEY TO

146
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:08,641
CHILL.

147
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:08,975
WITH

148
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,810
>> I DON'T THINK I TRUST MIKE

149
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,061
BECAUSE HE'S A SOUTHERN BOY.

150
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,604
HE GOES CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY.

151
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,356
DO YOU GO TO CHURCH EVERY

152
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,066
SUNDAY.

153
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,485
HE GOES TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY.

154
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,487
WE'RE HAVING SUNDAY FUN DAY.

155
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:21,904
HE DOESN'T HAVE SEX.

156
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,989
>> IN WAY.

157
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,449
>> HE'S CELIBATE.

158
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,408
HE HASN'T HAD SEX IN LIKE EIGHT

159
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,201
YEARS.

160
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:27,910
>> YOU'RE LYING?

161
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,162
>> I SWEAR TO GOD.

162
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,872
WHAT DO WE HAVE IN COMMON.

163
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,831
YOU DON'T DRINK, YOU DON'T

164
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,165
PARTY.

165
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,125
>> JOAQUIN IS A POTENTIAL DUDE I

166
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,168
CAN WORK WITH.

167
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,419
WE'RE BOTH ABOUT GIRLS.

168
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,337
WE'RE BOTH ABOUT HAVING FUN,

169
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:38,921
PARTYING, NOT SETTLING DOWN.

170
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,466
>> WE'VE DEVELOPED A

171
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,592
RELATIONSHIP, WE'RE LIKE APPLES

172
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,593
AND ORANGES.

173
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,845
SO OBVIOUS, YOU KNOW WHAT I

174
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,054
MEAN?

175
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,555
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

176
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,474
AND I CAN TELL FROM LIKE FIRST

177
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,225
TIME I SAW YOU, YOU WORK HARD.

178
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:51,601
>> WE WORK HARD.

179
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,602
WE PARTY HARDER.

180
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,936
IT'S SIMPLE.

181
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,604
IF YOU MAKE IT TO THE END, YOU

182
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,355
GOT MY VOTE.

183
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,523
SO YOU AUTOMATICALLY.

184
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,983
>> I WANT THE MONEY TO STAY ON

185
00:05:59,067 --> 00:05:59,567
THE EAST COAST.

186
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,818
>> YEAH.

187
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,819
>> MIAMI, ME AND YOU.

188
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,820
>> ABSOLUTELY BROTHER.

YOU GOT THIS.

377
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,308
YOU CAN DO IT.

378
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,394
>> Jeff: THERE IT IS!

379
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:19,029
NAGAROTE WINS REWARD.

380
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,781
>> I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN.

381
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,617
I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN!

382
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:32,376
I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN!

383
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,836
>> Jeff: THAT WAS AN EXCITING

384
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,838
CHALLENGE AND NAGAROTE DID WIN.

385
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,089
I REALLY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO

386
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,549
HAVE A SPECIAL NIGHT TONIGHT.

387
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,175
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

388
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,176
CAMP.

389
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:46,015
ENJOY YOUR EVENING.

390
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,476
ESCAMECA, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

391
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,602
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

392
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,019
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

393
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,062
>> WINNING THE REWARD IS HUGE

394
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:52,688
FOR ME.

395
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,231
THAT GIVES ME A CHANCE TO BOND

396
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,441
WITH THESE PEOPLE BETTER.

397
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,942
AT THIS POINT I KIND OF HAVE TO

398
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:12,750
BECAUSE MY BUTT IS ON THE LINE.

399
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,209
>> IS THAT A PILLOW?

400
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,044
OH, MY GOD.

401
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:15,586
[CHEERING]

402
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,881
OH, MY GOD.

403
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,382
>> WINNING THE REWARD WAS

404
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:20,758
BEAUTIFUL.

405
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,718
IT WAS LIKE DAVID AND GOLIATH,

406
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,011
LIKE ALL YOU NEED WAS TO PUT A

407
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,471
SLINGSHOT IN OUR HAND AND WE

408
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,849
TOOK DOWN THAT GIANT.

409
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,101
>> I'M GETTING A BITE OF THAT.

410
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,437
>> AND THEN AS IF THAT WEREN'T

411
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,772
ENOUGH, EXTRA SPECIAL MACARONI

412
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,607
AND CHEESE, TONS OF BEEF STEW.

413
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,526
I FELT LIKE MY FIRST CHILD WAS

414
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,110
BORN, LIKE THAT'S HOW EXCITED I

415
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:40,903
WAS ABOUT THIS REWARD.

416
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,948
>> LOOK, THERE'S UTENSIL, GUYS.

417
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,534
>> WOW, THIS IS LIKE SOLID

418
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:46,742
CHEESE.

419
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,826
YOU'RE GOING TO FREAK OUT.

420
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,870
>> BEING THE UNDERDOGS THAT WE

421
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,455
ARE, WE WERE DOWN AND OUT AND

422
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,374
THEN WE PICKED OURSELVES UP AND

423
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,208
WE WON.

424
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,252
>> DO YOU WANT SOME HOT

425
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:56,502
CHOCOLATE?

426
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,045
>> THE TEAM IS DEFINITELY

427
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,506
GELLING, EVEN SHIRIN, WE'RE

428
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,423
TOLERATING HER AT THIS POINT.

429
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,300
>> THEY'RE EATING RICE, WE'RE

430
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,843
EATING BEEF.

431
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,720
YEAH, BABY.

432
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,556
>> RODNEY IS GOING TO BE LIKE, I

433
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,640
WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THAT THING.

434
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,643
WHAT A TOOL.

435
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,353
REWARD WAS REALLY GOOD FOR ME.

436
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,104
I WAS SUPER EXCITED TO BOND OVER

437
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,815
A MEAL AND MAYBE EVEN ALL GET

438
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,358
SICK TOGETHER, WHICH DIDN'T

439
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:19,692
HAPPEN.

440
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:19,984
>> NAGAROTE!

441
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,986
>> NAGAROTE!

442
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,114
>> AND GETTING TO LOOK FOR

443
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:25,823
TURTLES ON THE BEACH.

444
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,616
>> OKAY, GUYS.

445
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,117
WE'LL SEE SOME TURTLES.

446
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,202
GRAB YOUR FLASH LIGHT AND LET'S

447
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:30,578
GO.

448
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,162
>> IT GAVE ME A CHANCE TO

449
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,748
CONNECT WITH THEM ON A HUMAN

450
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,332
LEVEL AND THAT'S LIKE MY BEST

451
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:35,958
SHOT AT STAYING IN THE GAME

452
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,334
RIGHT NOW.

453
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,669
I THINK WE ALL DID THAT.

454
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,087
I THINK WE ALL HAD A MAGICAL

455
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,421
TIME TOGETHER.

456
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,008
>> OH, WOW.

457
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,427
>> YOU HAVE THE TURTLE HERE.

458
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,679
>> THEY'RE SO HUGE.

459
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,680
>> OH, MY GOSH.

460
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,056
>> I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST

461
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,057
TURTLE I'VE EVER SEEN.

462
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,142
>> WOW, THAT THING IS BIG.

463
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,935
>> SHE COMES FROM THE WATER.

464
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,022
SHE STARTS DIGGING THE HOLE AND

465
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,441
THEN LAYING 120 EGGS.

466
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,818
ONLY ONE WILL SURVIVE.

467
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:03,027
>> WOW.

468
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,155
>> THE TURTLE GUIDE TOLD US HOW

469
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,782
THE SEA TURTLES HAUL THEIR GIANT

470
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,410
SELVES UP THIS BEACH, DIG A

471
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,662
HOLE, LAY 100 SOME ODD EGGS AND

472
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,289
ONLY ONE OF THOSE EGGS MAYBE

473
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,250
WILL MAKE IT TO THE OCEAN.

474
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:25,924
>> THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

475
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,093
>> SHE'S COVERING IT UP NOW.

476
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,386
>> YEAH, SHE'S COVERING THE

477
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,678
NEST.

478
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,430
>> THAT'S REALLY AWESOME.

479
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,724
IT MADE ME REALIZE THE TURTLE

480
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,100
CHANCES IN LIFE ARE WAY WORSE

481
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,062
ODDS THAN ME WINNING "SURVIVOR."

482
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,565
>> SHE'S PROTECTING THE EGGS.

483
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,193
>> I HAVE A ONE IN 14 CHANCE AT

484
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:50,616
WINNING $1 MILLION, COMPARED TO

485
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,493
A ONE IN 100 CHANCE AT LIVING,

486
00:15:52,576 --> 00:16:02,252
SO THAT'S COOL.

487
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,214
>> I WANTED THAT MAC AND CHEESE

488
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,091
SO BAD.

489
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,384
SO BAD.

490
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,053
>> I'M ABOUT TO BRING UP THAT

491
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:11,887
CRAB TRAP.

492
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,223
>> I'M GOING TO SEE IF I CAN GET

493
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:21,188
SOME FISH.

494
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,857
>> YOU AND DAN HAVE AN ISSUE?

495
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,317
>> I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH ALL OF

496
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:25,818
THEM.

497
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,402
THE DAY THAT I KNEW WE WERE

498
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,237
GOING TO SWITCH WAS THE BEST DAY

499
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,201
OF MY LIFE.

500
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,828
>> I'LL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO

501
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,122
GIVE IT RIGHT BACK TO THEM.

502
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,082
I'M SO EXCITED.

503
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,000
THESE BLUE COLLARS, THEY WERE IN

504
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:42,376
SHAMBLES.

505
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,086
SIERRA WAS THE ODD WOMAN OUT,

506
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,922
WHICH IS PERFECT.

507
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,632
SO IT'S BASICALLY LIKE, HERE YOU

508
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:48,924
GO, JOAQUIN.

509
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,884
YOU HAVE ALL THE AMMUNITION.

510
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,053
IT'S LIKE AN EASY LAYUP FOR ME.

511
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,263
OBVIOUSLY IT'S ME AND TYLER, YOU

512
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,764
KNOW THAT.

513
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,683
TYLER'S THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY,

514
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,851
HONEST, GENUINE PERSON IN THIS

515
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,059
CAMP.

516
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,227
>> I GET THAT.

517
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,979
>> THE THING IS JOE IS REALLY

518
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:02,312
STRONG.

519
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,022
WE DON'T WANT JOE PLAYING TOO

520
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:04,690
FAR INTO THE GAME.

521
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,984
AND YOU AND RODNEY ARE LIKE...

522
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:07,276
>> NO.

523
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,277
>> GET OUT OF HERE.

524
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,779
>> NOT EVEN RODNEY?

525
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,866
>> NO.

526
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,535
>> WE NEED FOUR.

527
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,537
>> YOU WANT ME TO SUCK UP TO

528
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:18,787
RODNEY?

529
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,414
>> I THINK I CAN TAKE CARE OF

530
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,374
ROD NISM RIGHT OFF THE BAT WE

531
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:22,916
HIT IT OFF.

532
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,168
>> I FEEL LIKE THE PEOPLE FROM

533
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,836
MY OLD TRIBE SUCK, AND I DON'T

534
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,128
TRUST THEM.

535
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,629
SO MY BIGGEST CONNECTION AT THIS

536
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,797
POINT IS WITH JOAQUIN.

537
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,257
HE MAKES ME FEEL COMFORTABLE.

538
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,508
HE LOOKS ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE.

539
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,134
HE'S LIKE ONE OF MY BROS FROM

540
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,844
HOME.

541
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,137
HE'S ALSO TIGHT WITH TYLER, AND

542
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,264
THESE TWO SEEM TO BE<i> THE</i> MOST

543
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,767
TRUST WORTHY PEOPLE I'VE MET TO

544
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,560
DATE.

545
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,270
HOWEVER, JOAQUIN'S TIGHT WITH

546
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,314
RODNEY, WHO IS JUST AWFUL.

547
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,816
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I CAN PLAY

548
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,484
THIS GAME WITH HIM.

549
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,151
>> I KNOW YOU PROBABLY DON'T

550
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,445
WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF

551
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:51,653
THEM.

552
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,655
>> I NEED SOMEBODY HONEST.

553
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,198
I'M LITERALLY REACHING FOR

554
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,700
STRAWS AT THIS POINT.

555
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,826
>> WHAT'S UP, CHAMP?

556
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,495
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THESE

557
00:17:59,578 --> 00:17:59,661
GUYS?

558
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:05,250
>> I LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE.

559
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,335
SIERRA IS STILL MAD AT ME.

560
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,253
>> I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH

561
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,338
HER.

562

563
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,882
AND HOLD GRUDGES.

564
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,342
>> SIERRA GOT MAD AT ME BECAUSE

565
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,011
I SAID SOME BAD THINGS ABOUT

566
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,554

567
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,555

TABLES TURN AND TIME HEALS ALL.

569
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,685
IN ORDER TO WIN THIS GAME, I

570
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,145
HAVE TO PUT MYSELF IN THE BEST

571
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,022
POSITION AND GET THE NUMBERS.

572
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:27,689
>> THEY CAN'T KNOW.

573
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,690
>> YOU GOT TYLER.

574
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,275
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A WALK.

575
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,152
A WALK.

576
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,531
>> IF IT'S ME, JOAQUIN, SIERRA

577
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,240
AND TYLER ALL ON THE SAME PAGE

578
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,867
AND WHEN THE TIME COME, I CAN

579
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,244
FLIP AND TAKE OVER THIS ENTIRE

580
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:40,452
GAME.

581
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,873
>> WE DID HAVE A LITTLE BEEF.

582
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,375
>> PRIME TIME STORY.

583
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,836
PRIME TIME STORY TO TELL FOR THE

584
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,795
REST OF YOUR LIFE.

585
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,797
>> AT THIS POINT I'M IN A GREAT

586
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,047
POSITION.

587
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,092
I HAVE SO MANY NUMBERS IT'S NOT

588
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,009
EVEN FUN EYE.

589
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,470
I CAN SEE MY HAND BEING RAISED

590
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,806
LIKE ROCKY BALBOA WINNING THIS

591
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:14,153

00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:18,907
YOYO.

596
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,492
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

597
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,952
THIS KID, HE'S GOING TO LISTEN

598
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:22,828
TO ANYTHING I SAY.

599
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,705
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THESE

600
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,790
CHALLENGES GET BLOWN, JOE'S

601
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,457
GOING FIRST.

602
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,750
I'M TELLING YOU, PUT YOUR TRUST

603
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,418
IN ME, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

604
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,795
THIS PLAN ALL DAY.

605
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,131
ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT LONG.

606
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,716
WHEN JOE GOES, I DEVELOP TRUST

607
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,968
WITH JOAC.

608
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,386
THIS IS MY IDEA.

609
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,429
I PRESENT IT TO MIKE.

610
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,639
IF WE BLOW NEXT IMMUNITY AND GET

611
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,807
IT OUT OF THIS GAME BEFORE WE GO

612
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,267
TO THE MERGE, WHO DO WE HAVE TO

613
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,811
DEAL WITH?

614
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,521
>> WE HAVE THIS GAME ON LOCK.

615
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,273
BEFORE WE GET AHEAD OF

616
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,399
OURSELVES, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

617
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,525
THE CHALLENGE GETS THROWN OR

618
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,651
THIS WHOLE PLAN GETS SCREWED.

619
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,236
>> DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT

620
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,446
WOULDN'T HURT MY FEELING IF WE

621
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:57,779
LOST.

622
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,490
>> RODNEY AND HIS GREAT VAST

623
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,243
PLAN OF, OH, I'M SUCH AN AMAZING

624
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,371
STRATEGIST AND I'M SO GOOD AT

625
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,998
THIS GAME THINKS WE SHOULD THROW

626
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,791
A CHALLENGE SO WE CAN GET RID OF

627
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,375
JOE.

628
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,835
VERY RARELY IN THE GAME OF

629
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,961
"SURVIVOR" DOES IT WORK OUT IN

630
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,630
YOUR FAVOR TO THROW CHALLENGES.

631
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,255
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE,

632
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,718
I THINK WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL

633
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,427
SITUATION.

634
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,181
MY REAL ALLIANCE IS WITH KELLY,

635
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,933
WHO POOR GIRL IS ON THE OTHER

636
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,768
SIDE ALL BY HERSELF, BUT I THINK

637
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,270
KELLY'S A FIGHTER, ENOUGH THAT

638
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,813
SHE'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT TO

639

640
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,193
THROW A COUPLE CHALLENGES AND

641
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:49,831
KEEP HER SAFE.

DROP THE CURTAIN AND RECREATE IT

652
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,914
ONCE YOU HAVE IT MEMORIZED.

653
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,207
FIRST TO GET IT RIGHT SCORES A

654
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:32,499

00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,152
YOU, THIS IS GOING TO BE A WALK

938
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:03,444
IN THE PARK.

939
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,113
>> WHO ELSE WOUND YOU WANT THE

940
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,948
SHARE THIS MOMENT WITH?

941
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,576
I'M TALKING RED SOX-YANKEES.

942
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,118
I HAVE SO MUCH LOVE FOR YOU.

943
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,453
>> BRO, THIS IS SO PERFECT.

944
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,205
>> I'M SO EXCITED.

945
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,165
HONESTLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS ME

946
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,000
AND TYLER AGAINST THE WORLD, BUT

947
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,043
NOW RODNEY IS MY RIGHT-HAND GUY.

948
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,129
AND SIERRA OWES ME ONE.

949
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,839
I TOOK HER OUT OF THIS SITUATION

950
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,464
WHERE SHE WAS LIKE THE ONE TO

951
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,090
GO.

952
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,301
SO, YOU KNOW, JOE'S DEFINITELY

953
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,218
GOING HOME.

954
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,177
AND IT SHOULD BE A WALK IN THE

955
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:33,641
PARK FROM NOW ON.

956
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,059
>> JOE, WHERE'S YOUR HEAD AT?

957
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,313
>> MAN, I'M DOWN TO DO ANYTHING

958
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,022
AND EVERYTHING.

959
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,274
EVERY TIME I TRAW TO TALK TO

960
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,067
JOAQUIN TO SEE WHERE HIS HEAD'S

961
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,861
AT, HE'S GOT A PUPPY DOG

962
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,194
FOLLOWING HIM.

963
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,530
>> I THINK THOSE TWO

964
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,156
WHITE-COLLAR BOYS ARE PLAYING US

965
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,074
FOR A FIDDLE.

966
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:50,992
THEY'VE REELED RODNEY RIGHT IN,

967
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,036
AND I'M AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO

968
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,288
BE REELING SIERRA IN AND US

969
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,205
THREE ARE GOING TO BE ON THE

970
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:56,873
OUTS.

971
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,750
>> TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

972
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,959
RODNEY CAME TO ME AND WAS LIKE,

973
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,169
WE GOT TO GET JOE OUT FIRST.

974
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,255
>> I WAS HOPING TO REACH OUT TO

975
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,590
TYLER AND JOAQUIN, BUT THEY

976
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,091
DON'T TALK TO ME AT ALL.

977
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,635
I THOUGHT THE THREE OF US COULD

978
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,094
WORK TOGETHER, BUT IT SEEMS THAT

979
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,722
THEY'RE GUNNING FOR ME, SO I'M

980
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,931
KIND OF SCREWED.

981
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,309
>> WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE IT WAS

982
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,269
LIKE SIERRA, SIERRA, SIERRA, WE

983
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,020
THOUGHT SHE WAS ON THE OUTS.

984
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:19,937
>> SHE WAS.

985
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,731
>> SHE'S STILL REALLY MAD AT

986
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,106
DAN.

987
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,983
UNDERLYING ISSUE, SHE'S REALLY

988
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,818
NOT HAPPY.

989
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,236
>> AND I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT

990
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,988
GROVEL, BUT I THINK AS LONG AS

991
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,823
IT'S NOT HER NAME AGAIN, SHE'LL

992
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,616
GO ALONG WITH ANYTHING.

993
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,994
>> AT THIS POINT, MY OPTIONS ARE

994
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:35,620
LIMITED, SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE

995
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:39,082
BEST OF THE WORST SCENARIO.

996
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:39,540
AND HOPE IT WORKS OUT.

997
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,084
>> SIERRA WOULD BE THE SWING.

998
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,544
>> YEP.

999
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,632
>> IF WE HAD SIERRA, WE'LL SEND

1000
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,132
JOAQUIN HOME.

1001
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,219
>> AT THIS POINT, JOE IS WITH

1002
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,178
US.

1003
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:52,720
UNFORTUNATELY SIERRA AND I

1004
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,514
DEFINITELY HIT A ROUGH PATCH.

1005
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,139
I BLEW IT.

1006
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,933
HANDS DOWN.

1007
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:57,225
NO EXCUSES.

1008
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,017
NO GETTING AROUND IT.

1009
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,102
I SCREWED UP.

1010
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,396
AND NOW WE NEED TO BRING HER

1011
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:07,568
BACK INTO THE FOLD.

1012
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,446
>> LOOKING AT RODNEY WITH

1013
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,240
JOAQUIN, WE HAVE TO SEPARATE

1014
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,241
THOSE TWO.

1015
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,284
LISTEN, I SCREWED UP.

1016
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,912
I WANT TO EARN YOUR TRUST BACK,

1017
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,331
BUT WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

1018
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,833
WE GOT RID OF HER BEST FRIEND

1019
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,417
BECAUSE SHE WAS GETTING TOO

1020
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,836
CLOSE, AND WE HAVE TO DO THE

1021
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,423
SAME THING.

1022
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:28,631
AGREED?

1023
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,215
>> AT THIS POINT I HAVE TWO

1024
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,134
SEPARATE ALLIANCES SAYING, COME

1025
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,261
WITH US, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU,

1026
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,262
AND IT'S NICE, IT'S REFRESHING

1027
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,265
TO HAVE PEOPLE WANT ME.

1028
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,851
HOWEVER, TO HAVE MY OLD TRIBE

1029
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,895
HURT ME SO BAD AND NOW SAY THEY

1030
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,063
NEED ME, IT MAKES ME SICK TO MY

1031
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,440
STOMACH.

1032
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,234
>> JOE WOULD VOTE FOR JOAQUIN,

1033
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,487
AS LONG AS IT ISN'T HIM, HE'LL

1034
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,530
BE HAPPY.

1035
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,990
RODNEY ON FIRST VOTE LEAVES THE

1036
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:54,449
THREE OF US, PLUS JOE.

1037
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,993
WE STILL HAVE THE NUMBERS, BUT

1038
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,911
AS SOON AS WE HIT JOAQUIN,

1039
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:04,792
RODNEY IS GOING TO EXPLODE.

1040
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,043
JUST CLOSE YOUR MOUTH, OPEN YOUR

1041
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,086
EARS AND JUST WATCH WHAT

1042
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:07,295
HAPPENS.

1043
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,379
>> I HATE DAN.

1044
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,090
AND AT THIS POINT, I'M JUST VERY

1045
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,175
ANGRY.

1046
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,426
THE BLUE COLLARS, THEY DON'T

1047
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,135
CARE ABOUT ME.

1048
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,219
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP ME

1049
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:15,928
AROUND.

1050
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,388
THEY'RE JUST USING ME FOR THE

1051
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,638
MOMENT.

1052
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,181
>> EVERYBODY'S WRITING JOE'S

1053
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,515
NAME.

1054
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,141
EVERYBODY.

1055
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,602
>> I'M WITH YOU, MAN.

1056
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,645
>> I'M JUST THE TYPE OF PERSON,

1057
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,189
I PLAY WITH MY HEART AND MY

1058
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,440
HEAD, AND, OF COURSE NEW YORK

1059
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,442
THIS GAME, IT'S GOING TO GET ME

1060
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,318
IN TROUBLE.

1061
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,569
AT THIS PILOT I'M PLAYING BOTH

1062
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:31,986
SIDES.

1063
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,071
I DON'T KNOW, NOT ONLY WHO TO

1064
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,907
TRUST, BUT WHO IS GOING TO BE

1065
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,699
BETTER IN THE LONG RUN.

1066
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,618
YOU CAN CHOOSE ONE PATH AND IT

1067
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,202
MIGHT TAKE ME TO THE FINAL

1068
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:39,911
THREE.

1069
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,829
YOU NEVER KNOW, AND I STILL AT

1070
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,623
THIS POINT DO NOT KNOW WHICH

1071
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,249
ROUTE I'M GOING TO TAKE.

1072
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,126
BUT EITHER WAY, IT COULD CHANGE

1073
00:34:47,210 --> 00:35:05,520
THE WHOLE GAME.

1074
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,276
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1075
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,070
SO AFTER THE SWITCH WE END UP

1076
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,530
WITH FOUR BLUE COLLARS, TWO

1077
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,698
WHITE COLLARS AND ONE NO COLLAR.

1078
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,742
JOE, WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO CAMP,

1079
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,494
DID IT APPEAR THE FOUR BLUE

1080
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,537
COLLARS WERE VERY HAPPY THAT

1081
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,372
THEY HAD STAYED TOGETHER IN THIS

1082
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:24,705
RANDOM REDRAW?

1083
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,292
>> ON THE SURFACE, THEY SEEMED

1084
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,877
LIKE ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

1085
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,254
BUT EVERY FAMILY IS IMPERFECT,

1086
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,215
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE FEUDS AND

1087
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,425
CRACKS AND ME, JOAQUIN AND TYLER

1088
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,301
WERE DEFINITELY TRYING TO FIND

1089
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,263
THOSE AND EXPLOIT THEM A LITTLE

1090
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:40,555
BIT.

1091
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,931
>> Jeff: DAN, DID YOU SENSE

1092
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,515
THAT, THAT THESE THREE WERE

1093
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,725
TRYING THE LOOK FOR SOME WAY IN?

1094
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,268
>> YEAH.

1095
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,562
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME

1096
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,063
OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLOIT.

1097
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,815
TO SAY THERE WERE CRACKS IN THE

1098
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,983
ARMOUR, THERE'S NO TWO WAYS

1099
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,192
ABOUT IT.

1100
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,277
THERE'S DYSFUNCTION HERE.

1101
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,362
SO I'M DEFINITELY CONCERNED.

1102
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,114
>> Jeff: SO TYLER, WHAT DO YOU

1103
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,323
LOOK FOR?

1104
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,533
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PICK UP

1105
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:00,700
ON?

1106
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,284
>> HONESTLY, JEFF.

1107
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,495
I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

1108
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,581
WHAT WE FOUND WAS BAD BLOOD AND

1109
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,208
ANIMOSITY AND A LOT OF IT SEEMED

1110
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,418
TO REVOLVE AROUND SIERRA.

1111
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,919
>> Jeff: SIERRA, IS THAT TRUE?

1112
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:12,879
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1113
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,422
AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL, I WAS

1114
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:14,922
MISTREATED.

1115
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,841
I WAS TOLD HOW I SUCK AT

1116
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,550
CHALLENGES, HOW I DON'T HELP

1117
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,343
AROUND CAMP, JUST EVERYTHING YOU

1118
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,179
COULD PUT ON ME, THEY DID.

1119
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,890
>> NOT ALL OF US PICKED ON YOU.

1120
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,600
>> WHEN IT WAS GOING DOWN, MIKE

1121
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,685
STOOD IN AND SAID, YOU GUYS, YOU

1122
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,436
HAVE TO STOP.

1123
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,396
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT, BUT I FELT

1124
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,480
MORE APPRECIATED IN 24 HOURS

1125
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,399
WITH THESE PEOPLE THAN I FELT 11

1126
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,861
DAYS WITH THESE THREE BEHIND ME.

1127
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,862
>> Jeff: WOW.

1128
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,113
MIKE, THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS.

1129
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,448
YOU'RE NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE

1130
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,159
IF SIERRA WANTS TO MOVE TO THE

1131
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,494
OTHER SIDE, THE GAME FLIPS AND

1132
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,954
YOU, DAN AND RODNEY ARE IN

1133
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:47,163
TROUBLE.

1134
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,290
>> WELL, I MEAN, THE FOUR OF US

1135
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,084
HAVE BEEN TOGETHER NOW FOR 16

1136
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:52,335
DAYS.

1137
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:56,339
BUT I DON'T FEEL THAT WE ARE A

1138
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,299
FOURSOME OF IMPENETRABLENESS.

1139
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,301
AND IF THESE THREE WERE ABLE TO

1140
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,387
SEE SOME TYPE OF CRACK AND WOO

1141
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,431
ONE OF US IN, I'M DEFINITELY

1142
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,516
AFRAID TONIGHT, 100%.

1143
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,393
>> BUT, JEFF, THAT'S THE BEAUTY

1144
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,436
ABOUT WHEN YOU DROP YOUR BUFFS.

1145
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,104
OPPORTUNITIES OPEN.

1146
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:12,855
THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOME

1147
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,273
PROBLEMS WITH ALL OF US, BUT I

1148
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,192
GOT THREE NEW PEOPLE OVER HERE,

1149
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,276
I GOT THREE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN

1150
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,320
DEALING WITH, YOU KNOW, FOR 16

1151
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:19,779
DAYS DRIVING ME NUTS.

1152
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,739
I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE

1153
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,158
BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR ME?

1154
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,202
>> Jeff: JOAQUIN, WOULD YOU

1155
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,745
HAVE EVER IMAGINED THAT YOU'D BE

1156
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,830
SITTING AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

1157
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,998
THINKING, I'M NOT AS CONCERNED

1158
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:31,624
AS I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE BEEN A

1159
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,875
FEW DAYS AGO.

1160
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,501
>> I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING

1161
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,128
TO GO THIS WAY, JEFF, BUT WHEN

1162
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,505
PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU AND

1163
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,382
BASICALLY EXPLAIN THEIR

1164
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,051
REASONING FOR HATING EACH OTHER,

1165
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:42,677
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY EASIER

1166
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,803
FOR ME.

1167
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,012
>> Jeff: JOE, IS THERE ANY

1168
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:45,638
PART OF YOU THAT'S WONDERING HOW

1169
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,431
MUCH OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS

1170
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,766
TRUE AND HOW MUCH OF WHAT

1171
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,517
THEY'RE SAYING IS WHAT THEY

1172
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,643
THINK YOU WANT TO HEAR?

1173
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,603
>> YEAH, THESE FOUR COULD SIT

1174
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,605
THERE AND SAY, LET'S KNOCK 'EM

1175
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,149
OUT ONE BY ONE, BUT

1176
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,693
STRATEGY-WISE, I'M ON THE VERY

1177
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,944
BOTTOM, AT LEAST JOAQUIN HAS

1178
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:00,319
TYLER.

1179
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,071
I GOT NOBODY.

1180
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,407
>> Jeff: SIERRA, ONE OF THE

1181
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,783
HALLMARKS OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID

1182
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,244
AS BLUE COLLARS IS THAT WE DO

1183
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,578
ULTIMATELY TAKE CARE OF EACH

1184
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,204
OTHER.

1185
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,039
>> JEFF, IT WASN'T THAT MY NAME

1186
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,540
WAS WRITTEN DOWN.

1187
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,667
IT WAS WHEN WE GOT BACK TO CAMP

1188
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,585
AND I GOT ATTACKED PERSONALLY.

1189
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,045
I CAN'T TRUST PEOPLE WHO DO

1190
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:18,212
THAT.

1191
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,463
>> Jeff: BUT NO MATTER HOW

1192
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,215
MUCH YOU DON'T LIKE SOMEBODY,

1193
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,342
YOU'VE GOT FOUR RIGHT THERE.

1194
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,844
WHY NOT SIT TOGETHER FOR A

1195
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,386
COUPLE MORE VOTES.

1196
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,095
>> RIGHT.

1197
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,347
NEW YORK I MEAN, I'M NOT STUPID,

1198
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,390
I GET THAT.

1199
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,018
THERE ARE SOME GENUINE

1200
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:32,935
FRIENDSHIPS THAT I'VE GAINED

1201
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,270
WITH THESE PEOPLE, SO I HAVE TO

1202
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,771
LOOK AT IT AS A WHOLE AND BE

1203
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,107
LIKE, WHO DO I TRUST AT THIS

1204
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,983
POINT.

1205
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,651
>> Jeff: MIKE, IT'S KIND OF

1206
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,029
LIKE YOU WERE DATING AND THEN

1207
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:43,612
SOMEBODY DID SOMETHING WRONG,

1208
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,614
BUT YOU STILL LOVE, YOU WANT TO

1209
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,199
COME BACK, BUT YOU GOT TO WORK

1210
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:47,783
IT BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER GUY

1211
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,120
OVER THERE AND HE'S WOOING HER,

1212
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,540
AND IN THIS CASE IT'S SIERRA.

1213
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:54,957
[LAUGHTER]

1214
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,375
SMILES ASIDE, WHAT DO YOU DO?

1215
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,711
YOU CAN'T JUST SIT THERE AND

1216
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,129
SAY, SIERRA, IF YOU GOT TO GO,

1217
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:00,463
YOU GOT TO GO.

1218
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,423
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU

1219
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,382
HOPEFULLY CAN BELIEVE IN THE

1220
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,551
TRUST THAT YOU HAVE MADE EARLY

1221
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,553
ON OR THE TRUST THAT YOU HAVE

1222
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,973
MADE WITH NEW FRIENDS, BUT YOU

1223
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,350
NEVER KNOW WHO YOU CAN TRUST

1224
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,811
UNTIL YOU LEAVE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1225
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,563
AND THAT'S A VERY, VERY, VERY

1226
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:22,485
SCARY PREDICAMENT, JEFF.

1227
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,903
>> Jeff: IT SOUNDS LIKE THE

1228
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,654
DECISION OF WHO TO SEND HOME

1229
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,655
TONIGHT COULD BE A VERY BIG ONE

1230
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,031
FOR THIS GROUP.

1231
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,866
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1232
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,578
DAN, YOU'RE UP.

1233
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:55,309
>> SORRY, RODNEY.

1234
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,269
>> JOAQUIN, LOOKS LIKE IT'S ME

1235
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:07,696
OR YOU TONIGHT.

1236
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,158
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1237
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:18,874
VOTES.

1238
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,459
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1239
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,961
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1240
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:27,383
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1241
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:27,591
OKAY.

1242
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,009
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1243
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:29,385
DECISION IS FINAL.

1244
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,387
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1245
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,763
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1246
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,472
IMMEDIATELY.

1247
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,351
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1248
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:42,481
FIRST VOTE, JOE.

1249
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,443
JOAQUIN.

1250
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:51,907
JOE.

1251
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:52,575
JOAQUIN.

1252
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,786
TWO VOTES JOE, TWO VOTES

1253
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,080
JOAQUIN.

1254
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:02,168
THAT'S THREE VOTES JOE.

1255
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:02,877
JOAQUIN.

1256
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,379
THREE VOTES JOE, THREE VOTES

1257
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:05,713
JOAQUIN.

1258
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,883
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1259
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:13,345
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT, JOAQUIN.

1260
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:29,862
PLEASE BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1261
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:35,576
JOAQUIN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1262
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:45,294
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1263
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,463
WELL, TONIGHT'S CONVERSATION

1264
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,964
CENTERED AROUND CRACKS.

1265
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:49,715
YOUR SUCCESS IN THIS GAME

1266
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,634
DEPENDS ON YOUR ABILITY TO

1267
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,553
REPAIR OR EXPLOIT THOSE CRACKS

1268
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:54,845
DAY BY DAY.

1269
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,972
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1270
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:57,389
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1271
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,350
GOOD NIGHT.

1272
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,484
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR

1273
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:13,656
NEXT EPISODE.

1274
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,114
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1275
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,991
"SURVIVOR"...

1276
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:16,659
>> TEAMING UP BEHIND MY BACK?

1277
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,953
>> Jeff: RODNEY FEELS BETRAYED

1278
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:19,703
BY HIS BLUE-COLLAR FAMILY.

1279
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,747
>> PEOPLE WHO DID ME WRONG TODAY

1280
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,624
ARE GOING TO PAY.

1281
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,750
>> Jeff: BUT IN "SURVIVOR"

1282
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,379
THERE'S ALWAYS TIME FOR REVENGE.

1283
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,215
>> I FELT EXTREMELY DISRESPECTED

1284
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,591
BY THESE BLUE, SO YOUR NUMBERS

1285
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:40,641
ARE DUNSO.

1286
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,643
>> I TOTALLY GOT BLINDSIDED BY

1287
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:42,893
THE FOUR.

1288
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:43,602
I HAVE A GOOD GUESS.

1289
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,646
I'M SURE MIKE WAS OBSESSED WITH

1290
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,897
SIERRA.

1291
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,190
I WAS GETTING TOO CLOSE WITH

1292
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,233
SIERRA AND RODNEY.

1293
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,901
THEY WERE FEELING LIKE I WAS

1294
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:51,485
PULLING THEIR TRIBE AWAY THERE

1295
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:51,694
THEM.

1296
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,112
GET THIS GUY OUT OF HERE.

1297
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:57,116
BUT THIS IS MY FAITH.

1298
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,200
I'M GOING THE TAKE WITH IT A
