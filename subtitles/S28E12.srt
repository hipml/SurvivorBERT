1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:04,212
>> PREVIOUSLY ON SURVIVOR.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:04,713
>> THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,131
>>BLACK GETS YOU THE ADVANTAGE

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,883
>> FOR 30 DAYS SPENCER AND

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,760
TONY HAVE BEEN ON OPPOSITE

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,678
PATHS.

7
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,138
>> BOTH PUT YOUR PALMS OUT.

8
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,639
>> Jeff: EVERYTHING HAS GONE

9
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,850
RIGHT FOR TONY.

10
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,268
HE'S BEEN AT THE TOP OF THE

11
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,477
MAJORITY ALLIANCE AND HAS

12
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,895
MULTIPLE IDOLS.

13
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,897
>> YOU HAVE BEEN FINDING THE

14
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,190
ONE WITH DIFFERENT POWERS.

15
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,151
>> I HAVE TWO IDOLS IN MY

16
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:26,901
POSSESSION.

17
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:27,944
>> FOR SPENCER.

18
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:28,445
>> BLACK IS THE ADVANTAGE

19
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,113
WITNESS'S BEEN A DIFFERENT

20
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,824
STORY.

21
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,200
HIS LIFE IN THE GAME HAS

22
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,703
BEEN A CONSTANT STRUGGLE.

23
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,287
>> YOU HAVE AS MANY CLUES AS

24
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,497
YOU WANT,.

25
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,583
>> HE WASTED HIS ONLY IDOL.

26
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:41,875
>> JEREMIAH.

27
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,501
>> AND HIS ALLIES HAVE BEEN

28
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,213
PICKED OFF ONE BY ONE.

29
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:47,505
>> SEE YOU.

30
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,965
>> BUT THINGS STARTED TO

31
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,341
TURN AROUND.

32
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,384
>> SPENCER HAS IT.

33
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,802
>> HE WON IMMUNITY.

34
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,596
THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE WAS

35
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,473
TURNING ON EACH OTHER.

36
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,307
>> YOU WRITE MY NAME DOWN

37
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,433
AND YOU'RE GOING HOME.

38
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,893
>> HE EVEN MADE A FINAL

39
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,019
THREE PACT WITH KASS AND

40
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,189
WOO.

41
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,482
>> AND THEY TARGETED TONY.

42
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,485
BUT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL IT

43
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,028
FELL APART ONCE AGAIN.

44
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,196
KASS REALIZED TONY HAD

45
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:11,446
ENEMIES.

46
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,280
>> TONY PUT MOST OF THOSE

47
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,073
PEOPLE OVER THERE BUT NO ONE

48
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,451
WANTS TO SEE IT, JEFF.

49
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,327
>> Jeff: AND SHE DECIDED TO

50
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,995
KEEP HIM.

51
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:19,788
>> SPENCER COULD ONLY WATCH

52
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,331
AS THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE

53
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,083
TOOK OUT HIS ONLY ALLY.

54
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,835
>> TASHA, THE TRIBE HAS

55
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,670
SPOKEN.

56
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,088
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT

57
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:46,272
TONIGHT.

58
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,065
>> PART TWO?

59
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,067
SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE

60
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,694
WHOLE WHOLE SHENANIGAN?

61
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,779
JUST FOR FUN OR WHAT?

62
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,780
>> WE MADE A FINAL THREE

63
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,864
DEAL, SO WHAT WAS THE POINT

64
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,365
OF THAT DOING THAT IF YOU

65
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,200
DIDN'T MEAN IT.

66
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,493
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS ARE

67
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,245
PROPOSING BUT I ALREADY HAVE

68
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,454
A FINAL THREE.

69
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,248
>> AT TRIBE AT COUNCIL KASS

70
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,291
AND WOO VOTED FOR TASHA SO

71
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,793
IT TURNS OUT THE DEAL THAT

72
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,794
WE HAD WAS A LIE.

73
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,879
SO I LEFT TRIBAL KIND OF

74
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,129
CONFUSED.

75
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:10,713
>> YOU COULD HAVE JUST TOLD

76
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,007
ME YOU WERE VOTING TASHA OUT

77
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,008
AND THERE'S NOTHING I COULD

78
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,218
HAVE DONE ABOUT IT.

79
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,178
WHY BOTHER WITH THE WHOLE

80
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,263
CHARADE.

81
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,347
>> WHY DOES ANYONE LIE IN

82
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,140
THIS GAME, IT'S PART OF THE

83
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:21,349
GAME.

84
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,475
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY I

85
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,852
REALIZED THAT TONY HAS BEEN

86
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,436
A JERK TO PRETTY MUCH

87
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,187
EVERYONE AT SOME POINT IF

88
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,105
THE GAME.

89
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,106
MAYBE I WOULD RATHER GO TO

90
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,691
THE END WITH TONY WHO HAS

91
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,733
BURNED SO MANY BRIDGES AND

92
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,443
JUST BEEN SO OBNOXIOUS THAT

93
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,403
NOBODY WANTS HIM TO WIN.

94
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,320
>> I GUESS THE BOTTOM LINE

95
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,739
IS, SPINESER, THEY WERE

96
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,073
TOYING WITH YOU.

97
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:37,615
>> RIGHT, THEY WERE TOIING

98
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,743
WITH ME, JUST FOR FUN.

99
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,828
>> THAT'S LOILTS, MY FRIEND.

100
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,453
>> THEY ARE LOYAL.

101
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,371
>> AS LONG AS THEY DON'T

102
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,622
STAB ME IN THE BACK I WILL

103
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,206
NEVER STAB THEM IN THE BACK.

104
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,500
>> I AM PLAYING AGAINST TONY

105
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,043
WHO HAS PLAYED ALL THESE

106
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,211
PEOPLE LIKE A FIDDLE AND

107
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,754
THREE FOOLISH PLAYERS WHO

108
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,840
DON'T THINK FOR THEMSELVES

109
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,300
AND I'M ALMOST DEFINITELY

110
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,217
NEXT TO GO.

111
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,302
BUT IF I HAVE ANY HOPE IN

112
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,261
THE GAME, IT'S THE FACT THAT

113
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,555
I'M PLAYING WITH PEOPLE WHO

114
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:11,316
UNDERSTAND IT SO LITTLE.

115
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,650
>> SO YEAH THIS IS IT, MAN,

116
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,193
THE FINAL STRETCH, MY

117
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:14,944
FRIEND.

118
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,403
>> I'M GOING INTO THE

119
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,990
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE FEELING

120
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:19,574
SUPERCONFIDENT I'M GOING TO

121
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:19,741
WIN.

122
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,617
>> ME TOO, MAN.

123
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,367
>> AND I I'M GOING OUT THERE

124
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,203
AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO WIN

125
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,788
JUST SO SPENCER DOESN'T WIN.

126
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,205
>> RIGHT.

127
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,457
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

128
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:27,874
FINAL THREE.

129
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,292
YOU KNOW IF KASS WENT TO THE

130
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,461
END SHE AIN'T GET NOTHING

131
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:31,961
VOTES.

132
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,921
SHE WOULD BE PERFECT FOR

133
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,504
FINAL 3.

134
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,049
ME, YOU AND HER SHE GETS NO

135
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:36,716
VOTES.

136
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,218
>> I DID CONSIDER BLINDSIDING

137
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,303
TONY BUT IT'S A MOVE THAT I

138
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,305
DECIDED NOT TO MAKE BECAUSE

139
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,891
HONESTLY I FEEL LIKE SITTING

140
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:45,433
NEXT TO TONY AT THE END OF

141
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,393
THE GAME, TOP THREE WOULD BE

142
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,520
A LOVELY THING SINCE WE

143
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,647
STARTED THIS GAME TOGETHER

144
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,982
SO I NEED HIM TO SEE ME AS

145
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,524
SOMEONE THAT WOULDN'T BACK

146
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,817
STAB HIM, SOMEONE WHO WOULD

147
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,904
BE LOYAL TO HIM TO THE END.

148
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,907
SO I DECIDED TO FILL HIM IN

149
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,491
WITH WHAT WENT DOWN WITH THE

150
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,492
REWARDS.

151
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,327
>> SINCE WE WERE GOING TO

152
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,620
VOTE FOR YOU, THAT WAS HIS

153
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,580
GAME PLAN, WHICH KASS WAS IN

154
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,081
ON.

155
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,165
>> WOW, MAN.

156
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,541
>> SHE EVEN TOLD ME HEY, I

157
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,834
THINK WOULD BE BETTER IF WE

158
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,379
WIN TOP THREE BEING ME, KASS

159
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,673
AND SPENCER.

160
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,131
>> TELL ME ABOUT IT.

161
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,299
>> IT WAS GOOD THAT YOU CAME

162
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,051
TO ME BECAUSE THAT JUST

163
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,344
SHOWS ME INTEGRITY, YOUR

164
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,262
LOYALTY.

165
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,221
HE'S BEEN WITH ME SINCE THE

166
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:23,513
BEGINNING.

167
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,306
HE HAS PROVEN HIS TRUST AND

168
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:25,848
LOYALTY TO ME THROUGHOUT.

169
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,475
THE KID IS GENUINE AND IT

170
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,977
TEARS ME APART THAT I'M

171
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,603
GOING TO HAVE TO EVENTUALLY

172
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:30,937
BLINDSIDE HIM.

173
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,605
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE

174
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,107
SOMEONE LIKABLE TO THE END

175
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,691
BECAUSE HE MIGHT HAVE A SHOT

176
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,484
OF GETTING A FEW VOTES, HE

177
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,652
MIGHT GET A LOT OF VOTES.

178
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,069
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR

179
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:38,987
BUSINESS.

180
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,445
I'M THINKING ABOUT MY

181
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:39,696
FAMILY.

182
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,197
MY WIFE TOLD ME TONY, WHEN

183
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,240
YOU GO OUT THERE, DON'T DO

184
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,574
ANYTHING STUPID.

185
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,201
TRY TO WIN THE GAME.

186
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,245
TAKING HIM TO THE END IS

187
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:47,495
STUPID.

188
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,079
I WILL LISTEN MY WIFE ON

189
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,165
THIS ONE

190
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:34,208
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

191
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,585

PICKED TRISH FOR THE REWARD

353
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,673
BECAUSE IT JUST SOLIDIFIES

354
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,175
THAT THOSE TWO ARE LOCKED

355
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:16,759
TOGETHER.

356
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,677
TONY IS THE ALPHA MALE OUT

357
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,220
HERE AND SHE'S THE FEMALE.

358
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,472
THEY ARE LIKE A COUPLE OF

359
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,515

360
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,766

00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,267
CHICKS OFF HIM RIGHT NOW.

00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,686
AND EVERYONE CAN SEE IT.

364
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,522
AND IN MY VIEW NO ONE IN

365
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,064
THIS GAME SHOULD HAVE THAT

366
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:38,906
MUCH POWER.

367
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,659

368
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,327
LIKE A METAPHOR FOR WHAT'S

00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,663
TONY IS WINNING.

371
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,956

00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,042
NO ONE SEEMS TO BE BOTHERED

373
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:50,292
BY THAT.

374
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,503
EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE HANDY

375
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,255

382
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,477
IT'S NOT WORTH IT TO EAT IT

383
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,604
AND HAVE IT ALL COME BACK.

384
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,564
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE

385
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,232
SNORT A PIZZA DOWN LIKE

386
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:13,607
TONY.

387
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,402
IT STARTED COMING OUT OF HIS

388
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,736
NOSE AND EARS, PINEAPPLE

389
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,320
FLYING EVERY WHERE.

390
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:23,367
I WAS LIKE WHOA, DUDE, SLOW

391
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:23,576
DOWN.

392
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,243
>> YOU CAN HAVE THIS ONE

393
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,327
HERE.

394
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:30,958
>> TONY, YOU ATE FIVE.

395
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:31,709
>> HE DIDN'T HAVE THE

396
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,042
SPECIAL POWER.

397
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,419
>> YEAH.

398
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,462
>> YOU DO, BOTH.

399
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:34,670
>> YEAH.

400
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,547
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE

401
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,216
BOTH.

402
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,679
>> -- UH-HUH.

403
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,681
>> BOTH THE IDOLS I HAVE NOW,

404
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,724
EVEN THE IDOL WITH THE

405
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,766
SPECIAL POWERS HAVE TO BE

406
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,934
USED WHEN IT'S DOWN TO FIVE

407
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,478
SURVIVORS LEFT.

408
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,020
>> MY INTENTIONS ARE TO LIE

409
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,564
TO THEM AND ACT LIKE THE

410
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,857
SPECIAL POWER IDOL I'M

411
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,650
ALLOWED TO USE IT WHENS

412
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,193
THERE'S FOUR SURVIVORS LEFT.

413
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,196
IF THEY DO FOR ME MY BLUFF,

414
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:07,995
I'M GUARANTEED FINAL THREE.

415
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,332
>> SHE IS JUST RECKLESS.

416
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,208
>> NORMALLY I WOULD GET HER

417
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,250
OUT OF HERE.

418
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:13,834
BUT I CAN'T.

419
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,835
I WANT LETTER TO THE END.

420
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,837
>> THE GAME IS IN MY HANDS.

421
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,089
I HAVE THE POWER RIGHT NOW,

422
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,674
I'M IN THE DRIVER SEAT, I

423
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,175
WANT TO STAY STRONG WITH

424
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,260
TRISH AND KASS BECAUSE THOSE

425
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,053
ARE THE TWO LESS LIKELY TO

426
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,638
WIN OVER ME.

427
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,307
>> I KNOW I HAVE TRISH BUT

428
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,725
KASS AND I HAVE TO SOLIDIFY

429
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,604
SOME TYPE OF PLAN.

430
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,522
>> -- THE HELICOPTER

431
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,564
DELIVERING YOUR PIZZA.

432
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,482
>> YOU WON'T.

433
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,775
>> UNLESS YOU WIN THE

434
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:44,323
MILLION DOLLARS.

435
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,492
HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY,

436
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,034
KASS IF.

437
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,202
>> ALL RIGHT, MAN.

438
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,078
>> AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ALL

439
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:49,620
OF US.

440
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,204
BECAUSE IF EXPERIENCE IRWINS

441
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:50,913
ONE OF US GO.

442
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,581
>> I KNOW.

443
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,082
>> SO I'M GOING GIVE IT MY

444
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,792
ALL.

445
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,793
>> I'M GIVING MY ALL.

446
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,002
>> I WANT TO GO IN WITH YOU

447
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,462
AND IN WITH TRISH.

448
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,089
EVEN THOUGH YOU WENT BEHIND

449
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,800
MY BACK THEY TLID TRIED TO

450
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,133
BLINDSIDE ME.

451
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,593
BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT

452
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,177
RIGHT NOW.

453
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,679
I'M NOT TAKING IT PERSONAL.

454
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,263
I WANT TO GO WITH YOU AND I

455
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,723
WANT TO GO WITH TRISH.

456
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,809
>> TONY DECIDED TO CONFRONT

457
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,769
ME AND SAY I HEARD THAT YOU

458
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,270
WERE CONSPIRING AGAINST ME

459
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,980
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

OKAY WITH THAT BUT YOU

00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:19,942
SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT.

463
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,484
IT WAS STUPID OF WOO TO TELL

464
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,112
HIM AND TO TELL ME.

465
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,947
>> I WANT TO YOU FEEL

472
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,123
>> TONY PLEDGED ON HIS WIFE

473
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,583
AND BABY THAT IT'S STILL

474
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,209
GOING TO TAKE ME TO THE END.

SOIF'S BEEN FORGIVEN BY THE

476
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,004
MAFIA BOSS BUT IF I'M GOING

BULLY, JUST AN EXTREMELY

481
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,136
UNLIKEABLE PERSON.

482
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,178
AND HE WON'T GET ANY VOTES

483
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,139
FROM THE JURY.

484
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,391
SO CHAOS KASS IS BACK.

485
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,809
WOO TOLD ME EVERYTHING I

00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,602

YESTERDAY, YOU TOLD ME

489
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,523
EVERYTHING.

490
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:04,570
>> WHAT?

491
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,529

493
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,117
YESTERDAY.

>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

495
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,287
WHO ARE YOU INVESTIGATING?

496
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,913
>> WHY CAN'T I INVESTIGATE.

497
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,081

>> YOU WERE INTERROGATING

504
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,215
ME.

505
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:25,674

SHE'S AMAZING.

513
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,810
PEOPLE TOO.

514
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,270
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

515
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,772
>> HE SHOOK MY HAND AND

516
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,814
SWORE ON HIS WIFE AND BABY

517
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,900
THAT WE HAVE A FINAL 3.

518
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:43,901
>> IF PEOPLE TELL SECRETS

00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,069
AND IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU

520
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,445
THAT GO IN AND BLOW THINGS

521
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:46,612
UP.

522
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,447
>> I TOLD WOO THAT TONY

00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,991
FINAL 3 BECAUSE AT THIS

526
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,369
POINT YOU WANT AS MUCH

527
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,495
PARANOIAS YOU CAN STIR UP

528
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,954
ESPECIALLY AMONG TIGHT TIGHT

529
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:56,997
PEOPLE SO HE JUST SCREWED

530
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,124
HIMSELF BECAUSE NOW PERHAPS

531
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,335
WOO DOESN'T TRUST HIM.

532
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,420
>> SO.

533
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,880
>> PLEASE DON'T TALK TO ME.

534
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:05,798
>> EVERYBODY IS A LAWED TO

535
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,340
TALK TO TONY BUT NOBODY IS

536
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,425
ALLOWED TO TALK TO EACH

537
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:08,801
OTHER.

538
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,511
>> THAT IS HOW INTELLIGENT

539
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:10,886
YOU ARE.

540
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:11,970
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

541
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,681
TALKING TO PEOPLE AND REVEALING

542
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,057
SECRETS IS A TOTALLY

543
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,724
DIFFERENT ANIMAL.

544
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,060
WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT, YOU

545
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,061
WERE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO

546
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,020
TELL HIM.

547
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,480
I'M SORRY, I'M SUPPOSED TO

548
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,440
TALK DRAMA TO YOU.

549
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,108
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

550
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:24,525
BETTER?

551
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,276
THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW THAT

552
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,903
BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK.

553
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:28,404
IT'S LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING

554
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:28,570
ME.

555
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,572
STRATEGICALLY KASS IS

556
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,365
PERFECT TO BRING TO THE END

557
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,033
BUT SHE'S SUCH AN INSULT TO

558
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,869
THIS GAME.

559
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:36,662
THIS GAME.
SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

560
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,706
WE'RE DONE.

561
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,389
TONY I WANT YOU TO NOW

562
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,265
THAT WHAT I DID WAS STRATEGIC.

563
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,267
I DON'T TRUST YOU TONY.

564
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,352
I KNOW THAT, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM

565
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:00,894
YOU'RE OWN WORST ENEMY.

566
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,478
NOW ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE

567
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,146
DOESN'T KNOW IF HE'S ONE

568
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:06,275
OF YOUR PEOPLE.

569
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:06,817
WHAT ARE YOU DIGGING FOR NOW

570
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,153
PLEASE THAT'S ENOUGH.

571
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:21,123
LET ME CHECK TO SEE IF THAT TREE
IS RIPE WITH COCONUT.

572
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,417
I'M KIND OF OVER THE WHOLE TONY
THING,

573
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,962
BUT WU YOU NEEDED TO KNOW THAT
STUFF.

574
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,297
HE WAS GOING TO TAKE ME TO THE
FINAL THREE.

575
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,967
TO ME HE WAS PLAYING BOTH SIDES
WHEN HE TELLS WU SOMETHIING

576
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,470
AND HE TELLS ME THE SAME THING.

577
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,639
A TYPICAL STRATEGY WOULD BE TO
GET RID OF TONY,

578
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,642
BUT HE HAS AT LEAST ONE IDOL
THAT WE ARE AWARE OF,

579
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,605
PLUS HE'S SUCH A JERK I THINK I
CAN BEAT HIM IN THE END.

580
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,566
SO I THINK THE BEST OPTION FOR
ME AT THIS POINT

581
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,485
IS TO FILL IN WU AND SPENCER

582
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,945
AND SCRU UP TONY'S GAME.

583
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,364
AND HE REALLY DID PROMISE ON HIS
WIFE AND BABY WHICH I'M SURE

584
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,202
HE PROMISED YOU ON THE BOAT THE
OTHER DAY.

585
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,329
DID HE SWEAR ON HIS WIFE AND
BABY WITH YOU ON THE BOAT?

586
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:08,003
HE DIDN'T

587
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:11,048
WU DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON
THIS?

588
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,175
I DO THANK YOU!

589
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,062
NO YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE.

590
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,648
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY HE MIGHT NOT.

591
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,357
I THINK HE REALLY WANT TO KEEP
ME BECAUSE

592
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,193
HE DOESN'T THINK I CAN WIN.

593
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,572
THAT'S WHY HE'S SO MAD.

594
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,658
>> I HAVE BEEN A CLOSE ALLY

595
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,117
WITH TONY PLAYING THIS GAME

596
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,118
WITH HIM SINCE DAY ONE.

597
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,620
BUT IT'S COME OUT THAT HE

598
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,831
PROMISED CASS ON HIS WIFE AN

599
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,373
BABY GIRL THAT HE WOULD TAKE

600
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,332
HER TO THE FINAL 3.

601
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,502
WHICH MEANS THAT I KNOW FOR

602
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,212
ALMOST FOR A FACT THAT TONY

603
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,172
WAS GOING TO BLINDSIDE ME SO

604
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,216
MY TRUST IN TONY HAS GONE

605
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,093
DOWN TREMENDOUSLY.

606
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,344
I MEAN WOO IF I GO OUT,

607
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,847
RIGHT, TONY AND TRISH ARE

608
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,556
DECIDING WHICH ONE OF YOU

609
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,557
GOES TO THE END WITH THEM

610
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,182
AND WHICH ONE OF THEM GOES

611
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,642
HOME.

612
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,518
>> THE QUESTION IS WHAT TO

613
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,061
DO ABOUT IT.

614
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,813
>> WELL, IF YOU WANT TO

615
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,774
INSURANCE YOU MAKE THE FINAL

616
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,567
3.

617
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,901
>> GET TRISH.

618
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,735
>> YEAH.

619
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,406
>> UH-HUH.

620
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,534
>> THIS MORNING I OVERHEARD

621
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,744
KASS SAYING I WAS A GO AND

622
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,079

623
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:24,830
ME OUT.

624
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,040
WHICH REALLY INFURIATED ME

625
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:27,583
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SITTING

626
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,002
HERE TRYING TO BE NICE TO

00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:30,919

BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS,

630
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,133

00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:36,800
THAT.

632
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,220
>> YOU AND I REALLY HAVE T

00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,513
TO-- REPORT, ONE AND TWO.

00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,419
HUMAN BEING.

945
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,336
AND EVERYONE SEES IT THE WAY

946
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,672
I DO, EXCEPT FOR YOU.

947
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,340
EVERYONE HERE SEES YOU FOR

948
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,008
WHO YOU ARE, SEPTEMBER FOR

949
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,009
YOU.

950
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,177
AND IT'S REALLY QUITE

951
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,386
TRAGIC.

952
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,305
>> TRISH, TACK A WALK.

953
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,348
>> TRISH IS PISSED OFF

954
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,308
BECAUSE OY THREW HER UNDER

955
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,434

00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,435
THE GAME SO GET OVER IT.

957
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,436
BUT THINGS GOT A LITTLE OUT

958
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,562
OF HAND TODAY.

959
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,897
I MEAN IT WAS GOING TO COST

960
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,733
ME MY GAME, IT COULD.

961
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,692
>> WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT.

962
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,152
>> IN IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

963
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:44,157
TO GET WOO BECAUSE WOO'S GO

964
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,657
GOING TO BE THE DECISION

965
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,075
MAKER HERE.

966
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,911
>> WOO KNOWS TONY'S PLAN.

967
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,620
>> YEAH BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT

968
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,996
THEY ARE DOING IS

969
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,288
CONSULTING.

970
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,748
>> THEY'RE SAYING LET'S VOTE

971
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,374
FOR KASS, I KNOW THAT.

972
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,417
>> IF THOSE THREE WHO JUST

973
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,543
WALKED OFF ARE TOGETHER

974
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,044
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

975
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:56,836
>> WE JUST NEED TO TALK TO

976
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,004
WOO.

977
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,464
WE REALLY NEED --

978
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,050
>> YEAH.

979
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,718
>> ALL RIGHT.

980
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,261
THIS IS JUST BEFORE WE GO

981
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,804
ANY FURTHER, WOO, DO YOU

982
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,347
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME.

983
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,973
ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY

984
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:09,933
INTEGRITY OR HONESTY?

985
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,101
ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS DID

986
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:12,977
YOU PROMISE HER ON YOUR WIFE

987
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,229
AND CHILD.

988
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,772
>> I DID THAT, I'M TO THE

989
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,940
GOING TO LIE TO YOU, BUT I

990
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:17,982
KNEW SHE ALREADY TRIED TO

991
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,067
BACK STAB ME THAT IS THE

992
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,567
ONLY REASON I DID THAT.

993
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,444
>> YOU NEVER SWORE TO ME

994
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,571
ABOUT TAKING ME TOP THREE

995
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,614
SO-- S THIS'S WHY I WAS

996
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,114
SKEPTICAL.

997
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,241
>> I PROMISED YOU BUT I

998
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,700
DIDN'T SWEAR, BUT NOW I'M

999
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,952
SWEARING TO YOU, SHE'S GONE.

1000
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:29,911
>> TODAY I WAS DOING A LOT

1001
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,954
OF SCRAMBLING A LOT MORE

1002
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,997
LYING ALL BECAUSE KASS WENT

1003
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,375
BLABBING HER MOUTH TO WOO

1004
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,042
TELLING HIM I WAS TAKEN HER

1005
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,043
TO THE FINAL THREE.

1006
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,878
I DIDN'T MAKE ANY PROMISE TO

1007
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:39,420
GO TO THE FINAL THREE AND

1008
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,881
NOW HE IS SUSPICIOUS OF ME.

1009
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,341
>> I'M JUST LIKE CONCERNED

1010
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,384
JUST BECAUSE SHE CAME UP TO

1011
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:44,759
ME.

1012
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:46,427
>> I KNOW THAT.

1013
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,846
YOU ME ANTHONY VOTE FOR KASS,

1014
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,889
SHE IS GOES HOME.

1015
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,099
>> I HAVE TWO IMMUNITY

1016
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:51,266
IDOLS.

1017
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,934
IF NOBODY FLIP APPROXIMATES

1018
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,477
FROM THIS THREE IT IS

1019
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,019
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DO

1020
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,437
ANYTHING.

1021
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,438
KASS MIGHT BE A BEAUTIFUL

1022
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,023
PERSON ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD,

1023
00:30:59,107 --> 00:30:59,983
BUT AS FAR AS SURVIVOR IS

1024
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,694
CONCERNED, SHE IS ABSOLUTELY

1025
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:02,944
HORRIBLE.

1026
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,195
WHY WOULD SHE GO AND TELL

1027
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:04,946
HIM THAT I SAID ALL THIS

1028
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,365
STUFF UNLESS SHE WAS LOOKING

1029
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,741
TO BLINDSIDE ME.

1030
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,827
THEREFORE, SHE'S GOING HOME,

1031
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,494
PERIOD.

1032
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,495
>> WELL NOW WE'RE RIGHT HERE

1033
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,580
AND I WILL SWEAR MY WIFE AND

1034
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,080
MY KID IT'S ME, YOU AND

1035
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,039
TRISH.

1036
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,333
I SWEAR MY MOTHER, ON MY

1037
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,710
DEAD DAD, I SWEAR ON HIS

1038
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,044
GRAVE, ME, YOU AND TRISH ARE

1039
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,504
GOING TO THE END, ALL RIGHT,

1040
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,130
THAT'S TELEPHONE.

1041
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,048
>> SO WE'RE VOTING KASS OFF

1042
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:24,299
TONIGHT.

1043
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,633
>> SHE'S GONE.

1044
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,676
>> TONY HAS BEEN MAKING ALL

1045
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,218
THESE PROMISES PRETTY MUCH

1046
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:27,510
TO EVERYONE.

1047
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,804
SO AT THIS POINT I JUST

1048
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:30,305
DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH I CAN

1049
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,098
TRUST HIM.

1050
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,975
>> THAT'S IT, FINAL 3.

1051
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,934
>> THE PROBLEM S I'M PRETTY

1052
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,061
SURE THAT AT THE END OF THE

1053
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,063
GAME, TONY IS GOING TO SE

1054
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,232
SEE-- SAVE TRISH OVER ME SO,

1055
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,650
I'M THINKING MAYBE IT'S TIME

1056
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:51,534
TO MAKE THAT BIG MOVE.

1057
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,121
>> WHAT'S UP WOO.

1058
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,164
>>> YOU NEED HELP.

1059
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,667
>> YEAH, SURE ALL RIGHT.

1060
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,213
I JUST HAD.

1061
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,923
>> YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IT

1062
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:10,511
FEELS TRUST ME, ABUNDANTLY

1063
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,305
CLEAR WOO CAME OVER AND SAID

1064
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,806
WANT TO GET RID OF TRISH

1065
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,891
WHICH WOULD YOU AWESOME,

1066
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,100
UNFORTUNATELY I'M SKEPTICAL

1067
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,727
BECAUSE HE HAS THE BEFORE

1068
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,770
SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO

1069
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,313
SOMETHING AND DECIDED NOT

1070
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:20,480
TO.

1071
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,522
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS

1072
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,232
WOO IS ABOUT THIS.

1073
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,026
>> ALL RIGHT.

1074
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,071
I'M LOOKING LONG TERM FOR

1075
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,031
MYSELF AND FOR HIM TO COME

1076
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,159
UP TO KASS AND MAKE THE

1077
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,203
INITIATIVE OF BLINDSIDING ME,

1078
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,374
POTENTIALLY TRISH AND TONY

1079
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,375
ARE INSEPARABLE.

1080
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,126
AND IF YOU OR I WANT A SHOT

1081
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,169
AT WINNING WE HAVE TO HAVE A

1082
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,212
SHOT AT VOTING TONY OUT AT

1083
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,047
THE FINAL FOUR.

1084
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,131
AND WE CAN'T DO THAT IF FISH

1085
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,092
IS HERE.

1086
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,010
>> THAT'S WHAT IM 'S SAYING.

1087
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,595
I'M PRETTY MUCH SET ON

1088
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,179
VOTING TRISH, IF I VOTE OUT

1089
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,013
TRISH CAN WE MAKE A PACT

1090
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,266
THAT WE WILL GO FINAL 3.

1091
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,017
>> YES NO MATTER WHAT.

1092
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,435
>> COOL?

1093
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,144
>> I'M THE SWING VOTE AT

1094
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,229
THIS POINT.

1095
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,773
I CAN EITHER GET RID OF

1096
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,942
TRISH OR TAKE OUT KASS.

1097
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,652
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND AT

1098
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,152
THIS POINT.

1099
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,696
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE

1100
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:10,697
OUT WHAT OPTION IS GOING TO

1101
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,157
BE THE BEST FOR ME SO I GOT

1102
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,368
TO MAKE A HUGE DECISION AND

1103
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:19,080
TIME TIME IS TICKING.

1104
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,082
>> I JUST SAW WOO TALKING TO

1105
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,000
EXPERIENCE AND KASS AND I'M

1106
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:23,918
THINKING TO MYSELF WHAT THE

1107
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:24,544
HELL JUST HAPPENED.

1108
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,128
I THOUGHT WE WERE A STRONG

1109
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:25,420
ALLIANCE.

1110
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,672
YOU KNOW IS AN INJUSTICE TO

1111
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,256
BRING THAT GIRL TO THE TOP,

1112
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,382
MAN.

1113
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:29,924

1121
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,015
PAGE.

1122
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,226
IF NOT, I MIGHT HAVE TO

1123
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,561
BREAK MY PROMISE AND CHANGE

1124
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:41,936
THE PLAN.

1125
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,271
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

1126
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,272
>> WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS

1127
00:33:44,355 --> 00:34:01,456

00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,703
HIS BEST AND HE PREVAILED.

1146
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,537
>> Jeff: KASS, WHAT WAS THE

1147
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,622
VIBE AT CAMP AFTER THE

1148
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:42,872
CHALLENGE.

1149
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,624
>> THE MINUTE WE GOT BACK

1150
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,835
TRISH RAILED INTO ME LIKE A

1151
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,880
FRICKING WILD SKELETON BLUE

1152
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,048
EYED BAN CHI.

1153
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:52,507
>> Jeff: WHAT WAS THAT

1154
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:52,924
AGAIN.

1155
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:53,841
>> I DONE EVEN KNOW WHAT I

1156
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,510
SAID BUT I'M SURE IT WAS

1157
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:55,885
ACCURATE.

1158
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,595
SHE WAS YELLING AT ME,

1159
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,179
TELLING ME I WAS AGAINST HER

1160
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,515
AND JUST SHOWING HER

1161
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,390
CAPACITY FOR HATRED AND SHE

1162
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,184
WAS HOLDING THIS IN UNTIL

1163
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,894
SHE KNEW SPENCER WON BECAUSE

1164
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,354
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO VOTE OUT

1165
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,480
SPENCER.

1166
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,564
>> TRISH, ONE PHRASE IN

1167
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,650
THERE, YOUR CAPACITY FOR

1168
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,068
HATRED.

1169
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,110
>> YEAH.

1170
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,028
KASS UNFORTUNATELY IS ALWAYS

1171
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:14,779
THE VICTIM.

1172
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,238
AND SHE LIKES TO BE A

1173
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,156
TROUBLEMAKER BUT THEN SHE

1174
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,865
DOESN'T LIKE CONFLICT.

1175
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,367
IF GRUING TO BE AN AGITATOR

1176
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,911
AND PLOT WOO AGAINST TONY

1177
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,246
AND TONY AGAINST WOO, DON'T

1178
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,205
SIT BACK AND SAY BUT I

1179
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,248
DIDN'T DO EVERYTHING.

1180
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,290
NOW EVERYBODY IS BEING SO

1181
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,125
MEAN TO ME.

1182
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,001
SHE HAS A FIGHT WITH ALMOST

1183
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,253
EVERYBODY EVERY SINGLE DAY.

1184
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,838
>> I HAVEN'T FOUGHT WITH

1185
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,505
ANYBODY ON THE JURY.

1186
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,215
I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A

1187
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,007
CONFRONTATION WITH ANYONE

1188
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,384
OUTSIDE OF KASS TODAY.

1189
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,636
>> INSTEAD YOU JUST RAIL

1190
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,262
INTO SOMEBODY.

1191
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,305
I SEE, I SEE.

1192
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,933
>> Jeff: SPENCER.

1193
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:44,475
>> YEAH.

1194
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,601
>> Jeff: THIS IS GREAT FOR

1195
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,561
YOU BECAUSE ANY TIME SOMEONE

1196
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,312
ELSE IS CRUMBLING IT'S AN

1197
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:48,813
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE

1198
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:49,647
ELSE.

1199
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,274
>> I MEAN THINGS WERE PRETTY

1200
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,066
CRAZY TODAY.

1201
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,192
AND THE FACT THAT I WON

1202
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,486
IMMUNITY SPED UP THIS

1203
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,904
PROCESS OF THE FOUR HAVING

1204
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:57,363
TO TURN ON EACH OTHER.

1205
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,282
>> WOO, DOES THIS BREAK YOUR

1206
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,408
HEART A LITTLE BIT TO SEE

1207
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,244
PEOPLE ARGUING OR IS THIS

1208
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,120
STRATEGY WISE FANTASTIC FOR

1209
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:04,662
YOU?

1210
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,204
>> WELL, IT'S EVIDENT THAT

1211
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,040
THERE HAS BEEN HIDDEN

1212
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,292
VENDETTA AND ANIMOSITY AND

1213
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,418
WHEN THESE CONFRONTATION

1214
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,253
GOES ON, OUR FOURSOME BREAKS

1215
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,921
UP.

1216
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,633
NOW I LOOK AT IT AS THREE

1217
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,177
BRAWN VERSUS TWO BRAIN.

1218
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,263
>> Jeff: YOU'RE PUTTING KASS

1219
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,556
BACK WITH SPENCER.

1220
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,765
>> IT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

1221
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,810
AND THAT PUTS KASS IN A VERY

1222
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,478
VULNERABLE POSITION.

1223
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,897
>> Jeff: KASS, DOES THAT

1224
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,939
SHOCK YOU, BECAUSE YOU HAVE

1225
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,524
BEEN CLEAR ABOUT SAYING I AM

1226
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,651
NOT WITH THEM, I AM WITH YOU

1227
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,819
GUYS.

1228
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,653
>> I DIDN'T PREDICT THAT

1229
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,280
PSYCHO BITCH WOULD COME OUT

1230
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,281
AT ME TODAY BUT TONY WAS

1231
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,950
CAUSE TRYING TO TELL ME I'M

1232
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,492
FINAL THREE AN WOO IS FINAL

1233
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,577
THREE.

1234
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,328
>> IN YOUNG LADY IS

1235
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:45,620
DELUSIONA.

1236
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,996
THIS IS WHAT HAD.

1237
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,664
WOO APPROACHES ME AND SAYS

1238
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,541
KASS IS TALKING TO SPENCER,

1239
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,250
THEY WANT TO BLINDSIDE.

1240
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,878
I GO UP TO KASS AND SAY

1241
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:54,420
LET'S BE COOL, WE CAN MAKE

1242
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,922
IT TO THE END.

1243
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:56,464
BUT IT IS BETWEEN US, BLAH,

1244
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,299
BLAH, BLAH, SHE GOES BACK TO

1245
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,426
CAMP, WOO, IS IT TRUE YOU

1246
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,095
TOLD TONY THIS AND THAT.

1247
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,389
I SAID KASS YOU JUST SEALED

1248
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,432
YOUR FATE WHY WOULD YOU TELL

1249
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,808
HIM WHAT I TOLD YOU IF WE

1250
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,434
ARE WORKING TOGETHER.

1251
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,352
>> THE WOO EXCHANGE WORKED

1252
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,438
OUT AS I THOUGHT WAS.

1253
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:12,980
>> Jeff: SHE PLANNED THIS

1254
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,564
ALL ALONG.

1255
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,316
>> TONY SAID KASS THE DEAL

1256
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,734
IS OFF, I'M DONE WITH YOU,

1257
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,361
IT'S OVER, IN FRONT OF WOO

1258
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,779
WHO HE HAD A DEAL WITH.

1259
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,073
WHAT DOES THAT TELL WOO.

1260
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,407
SO TONY IN BEING SO

1261
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:23,658
ANGRY-- .

1262
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,409
>> I'M EMOTIONAL.

1263
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,997
I EXPRESS MY FEELINGS AND MY

1264
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:30,539
EXPRESSIONAL-- EXPRESSIONS.

1265
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,083
SHE SITS WITH THE SAME GRIN,

1266
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,252
MAD, HAPPY, SMILING, CRYING,

1267
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,253
SAME LOOK THERE IT IS.

1268
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,964
>> WELL, YOU'RE MAKING AN

SPENCER, YOU SEEM SORT OF

00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:56,440
DISGUSTED BY IT.

I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD BE
