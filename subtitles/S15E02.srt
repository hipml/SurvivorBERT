2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,752
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:03,878
16 Americans began the

4
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,046
adventure of a lifetime in

5
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,425
modern Shanghai.

6
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,217
They traveled back in time to a

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,263
remote section of rural China.

8
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,764
At a Buddhist welcoming

9
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,390
ceremony, Leslie was faced with

10
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,600
a moral dilemma.

11
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,101
>> I'm a believer in Jesus

12
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,478
Christ, and in the Bible it

13
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,187
says "Thou shall not bow down

14
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,857
to any other god."

15
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,610
I just couldn't do it.

16
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,529
>> PROBST: The survivors were

17
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,155
split into two tribes, Zhan Hu

18
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:35,744
and Fei Long.

19
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,120
After a heavy storm pounded the

20
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:41,207
Zhan Hu tribe, Ashley, the

21
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,752
professional wrestler, was down

22
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,044
for the count.

23
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:45,587
>> I want to throw up, but

24
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,339
there's just nothing in there.

25
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:48,798
>> PROBST: Chicken was

26
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,550
unimpressed with his tribe.

27
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,843
>> You think this here's going

28
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,719
to hold up?

29
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,595
>> We have to build something,

30
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,637
though, so let's stop being

31
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,513
negative.

32
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,806
>> I'm giving my opinion and

33
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,558
nobody wants it, so I'm done

34
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,059
suggesting.

35
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,311
>> PROBST: Meanwhile, back at

36
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,896
Fei Long, Todd nominated Aaron

37
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,271
as tribe leader.

38
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,272
>> We do need someone who is

39
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,149
strong and smart.

40
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,442
>> It feels weird, but I think

41
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,943
I can do it.

42
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,403
>> I am very, very smart in

43
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,864
trying push the leader role

44
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,199
more so on to Aaron.

45
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,409
>> PROBST: At the first immunity

46
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,494
challenge...

47
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,495
Neck and neck going into the

48
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,162
swamp.

49
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,414
...Fei Long came out on top...

50
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,626
Fei Long wins immunity!

51
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,419
...sending Zhan Hu to tribal

52
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,712
council.

53
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,508
Anybody here willing to say, "I

54
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,592
will be the leader of this

55
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,676
tribe?"

56
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,719
There's your leader.

57
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,221
Well, now you got two.

58
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,806
Dave and Peih-gee volunteered

59
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,598
to lead their tribe.

60
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,599
>> Yes!

61
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,767
>> PROBST: And in the end,

62
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,976
Ashley was spared.

63
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,102
First person voted out of

64
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,354
<i>Survivor: China--</i> Chicken.

65
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,271
>> Damn!

66
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,273
>> PROBST: 15 are left.

67
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,151
Who will be voted out tonight?

68
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,250
>> The fire pit has to be done

69
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,086
properly the first time.

70
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,089
We can't have any more oopsies

71
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:11,714
like we did with the shelter.

72
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,675
The shelter is one thing.

73
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,217
Man, once you do a fire pit,

74
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,219
we just got to do it once and

75
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,720
do it right.

76
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,138
Last night at tribal council,

77
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,098
questions came up about

78
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,140
leadership.

79
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:21,766
I raised my hand to say, "Heck,

80
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,102
I'll do it."

81
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:24,811
I didn't want to be in a

82
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,271
leadership role, but instead of

83
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,730
resisting things like that,

84
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,357
especially with the people in

85
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,608
my tribe, I think it's

86
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,235
actually better to embrace it.

87
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,778
I think pull this dead pine tree

88
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,406
out of the way, plopping the

89
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,907
bricks down right here.

90
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,117
>> I just kind of don't want to

91
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,493
sit next to the woods.

92
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,411
We could put where our water

93
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,454
collection is, and we'll just

94
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,372
move.

95
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:44,581
>> Yeah.

96
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,874
I think that will be good.

97
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:46,749
>> Uh-uh.

98
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,709
>> I mean, it will really help

99
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,585
with the insects.

100
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,460
>> I want more shelter for the

101
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,253
fire.

102
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:50,837
Putting it right there on the

103
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,754
edge?

104
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,797
No, I don't think that's a

105
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,882
great idea at all.

106
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,174
Okay.

107
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,301
We're moving forward.

108
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,302
I don't want to start

109
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,054
belaboring this kind of stuff

110
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:00,638
because it sucks a lot of time

111
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,057
and energy away from getting

112
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,643
stuff done.

113
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,061
>> Dave and I work pretty well

114
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:07,312
together.

115
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,230
We both kind of do it in

116
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,315
different ways, but if

117
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,943
anything, we're not being

118
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,485
competitive about, like, who

119
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,155
can be, like, leader.

120
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:17,780
>> I'm just trying to explain

121
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,240
the sensibility of why I think

122
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:19,407
it.

123
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,366
If someone can think of

124
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,076
something different...

125
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,036
>> No, no, you had valid

126
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,870
reasons for putting it over

127
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,537
there.

128
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,455
And you know what?

129
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,372
For me, like, if you have

130
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,373
definite experience that it will

131
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:27,957
work better over there, I'll

132
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,584
totally go with it.

133
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,710
>> It seems that Dave is kind

134
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,295
of<i> the</i> leader, the top guy, and

135
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,423
Peih-gee is just below him.

136
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,674
She's kind of like the balance

137
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,009
of power.

138
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,135
>> I think we've got like a

139
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:39,802
game plan...

140
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,553
>> We do.

141
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,055
>> ...set in place.

142
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,514
We can figure out who's going

143
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,683
to do what.

144
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,309
But most important is knowing

145
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,228
what the what is, you know.

146
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,313
>> Dave has a lot of good

147
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,940
ideas, but if someone questions

148
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,566
it or if somebody comes up with

149
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,400
their own idea, there is this

150
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,403
sense that he's probably still

151
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,446
going to go with his idea.

152
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,531
>> If we could get our act

153
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,824
together and do this fast this

154
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,450
morning and eat before our

155
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,078
possible challenge this

156
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,038
afternoon, we'd be rocking.

157
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,539
>> You're wishing really hard,

158
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,582
Jaime, I'll tell you that right

159
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,541
now.

160
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,460
You're wishing really hard.

161
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,379
>> You should wish hard.

162
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,714
>> Okay, fine.

163
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,757
>> It could get to the point

164
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,800
where people start getting fed

165
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:19,425
up and start talking about Dave

166
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,719
and how they don't necessarily

167
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,221
think he's a good leader

168
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,305
anymore.

169
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,390

00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,072
Me and Todd made an alliance

195
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,406
that we're going to stick it out

196
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,032
with each other until the end of

197
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,617
this because even though Todd, I

198
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,410
think, is very devious, I've

199
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:51,911
been watching him really

200
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,913
closely and I think we have a

201
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,331
good alliance so far, at

202
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,082
least until the merge.

203
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,050
>> At some point, should we

204
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:06,634
pull him in as number three?

205
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,594
>> Oh, yeah.

206
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,137
>> Because we need someone

207
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,305
strong to call our shots.

208
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,057
We make the plans and he speaks

209
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,308
them out, which puts the target

210
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,727
on him instead of us.

211
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,770
>> We decided to pull Aaron

212
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,646
into our group, so if anyone

213
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,898
has to take a rap for anything,

214
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,192
then it's going to be on Aaron.

215
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:23,776
>> Obviously, this is about

216
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,237
power players, right, and who

217
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,864
wants to go the furthest.

218
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,574
We need a three.

219
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,408
>> Which is us.

220
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:30,783
>> Which is us.

221
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,702
>> I think that would be smart.

222
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,163
>> Like, I will swear to you

223
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,875
guys with my whole life.

224
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,459
>> Three?

225
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,252
>> I will, too.

226
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,295
>> Okay.

227
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,004
>> Because that's how the game

228
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:43,629
is played.

229
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,964
You know, you have to.

230
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,048
>> The final three.

231
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,925
>> At that point, I mean, it's

232
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,010
sad to say, it's game on.

233
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:49,927
>> I trust.

234
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,179
>> I trust, too.

235
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,680
>> Amanda and I have this game

236
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,265
in our hands.

237
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,141
So we have our alliance.

238
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,934
We have exactly what I wanted

239
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,311
to come here to do.

240
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,688
>> You guys want to powwow?

241
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,564
So, a lot harder than what we

242
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,524
thought, huh?

243
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,025
Three sleepless nights,

244
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,443
everyone's on edge.

245
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,777
Everyone's angry.

246
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,820
We have to get into some sort

247
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,030
of routine.

248
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,741
>> Why don't we just all rest?

249
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,201
Now's a good time to get

250
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,035
refreshed.

251
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,786
>> Jean-Robert, you need to

252
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,872
start pulling your weight.

253
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,123
This is what I feel, not

254
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,791
whether I'm right or wrong.

255
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,169
You might want to talk about it.

256
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,170
>> I know that I'm not working

257
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,421
as much as I'd like to be able

258
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:26,547
to work, just because I've

259
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,924
slept a little bit less than

260
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,759
everybody, I think.

261
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,801
>> Jean-Robert needs to step it

262
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:30,968
up.

263
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:31,594
What is up with this guy?

264
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,720
He knows he's on the chopping

265
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,097
block, and it's pretty obvious

266
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,641
around camp.

267
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,725
He's trying to divert it, but

268
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,976
we're not buying it.

269
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,685
>> The wheels are turning here.

270
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,646
Believe me, I can contribute

271
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,524
probably as valuable of stuff

272
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,983
with my mind.

273
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,235
But, I mean, as soon as we

274
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,152
start getting food and water

275
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,362
and everything, I think you're

276
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,404
going to find I'm able to

277
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,822
contribute a lot more.

278
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:52,823
I'm considered one of the bad

279
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,866
boys of poker.

280
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,701
And I absolutely am using a

281
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,869
similar strategy in this

282
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,371
<i>Survivor</i> game.

283
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:58,996
I wanted to give the perception

284
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,082
I was a little bit lazy, so

285
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,708
later when I am contributing

286
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,002
and putting in the work effort,

287
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:05,670
people are noticing, "Hey, this

288
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,131
guy is doing beyond his normal

289
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,549
capabilities."

290
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,175
I know that I'd like to be able

291
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,593
to do a lot more than I am,

292
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,429
but, I mean, we've got a great

293
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,307
squad.

294
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,519
Even though it looks like I'm

295
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,895
in big trouble right now, it's

296
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,897
kind of part of the plan.

297
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,816
I can only go up from here.

298
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,165
>> Our biggest priority right

299
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,920
now are mud bricks.

300
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,797
I have specific goals.

301
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,090
We still have some shelter

302
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,174
stuff to fix, but we have

303
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,509
enough shelter.

304
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,051
I think that's all right.

305
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,679
The priority now we have flint

306
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,849
is to get a fireplace going.

307
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,560
It's a very realistic and

308
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,686
achievable goal today.

309
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,480
I want to keep goals achievable.

310
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,065
>> We need seven more.

311
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,783
Do you think there's any

312
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,535
possible way to at least start

313
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,038
a baby fire?

314
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,373
If we could get a spark started

315
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,833
up, we could put it under

316
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,293
something, just keep it alive.

317
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,210
>> You know what?

318
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,378
I would rather get some of it

319
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,963
up and then get a fire started.

320
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,135
>> All I asked was to make a

321
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:36,844
little baby fire to make a

322
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,679
handful of rice for everybody.

323
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,889
Instead, we try to build an

324
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,975
elaborate barbecue pit.

325
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,644
I'm not too thrilled about it.

326
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:51,567
>> Oh, wow, I'm so sorry.

327
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,943
I just totally hosed both of

328
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,695
you.

329
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,030
>> That's fine.

330
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,259
>> Ashley.

331
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,719
>> Oh, my gosh, what happened?

332
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,096
>> Dave drops the brick down

333
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,431
and splashes her.

334
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,474
>> Obviously he did it on

335
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,643
purpose.

336
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,727
I'd like to go steal the flint,

337
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,813
go out there and make me a

338
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,314
little fire and cook some rice.

339
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,277
>> We got the flint last night

340
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,737
at tribal council, and we

341
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,280
haven't even attempted to make a

342
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,574
fire.

343
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,743
And we're starving.

344
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,328
It just seems like we take the

345
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,205
longest route possible to make

346
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,541
something happen.

347
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,793
I'm losing faith rapidly.

348
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,051
>> Nothing here has wasted

349
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,594
energy.

350
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,137
I moved half those stones

351
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,723
myself just now.

352
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:04,974
>> Okay.

353
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,851
>> So if you can imagine...

354
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,435
>> So why don't we start the

355
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,561
fire...

356
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,395
>> Let me finish.

357
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,563
>> ...in the fireplace.

358
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,689
>> Let me finish.

359
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,148
Mud bricks yea high.

360
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,941
I'm not stacking mud bricks

361
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,025
around a burning fire.

362
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,235
>> Mud bricks or not, you can

363
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,194
still try and get the fire

364
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:17,778
going before the rain starts

365
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,279
falling.

366
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,280
The rain's going to fall.

367
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,406
But you're the leader, and I'm

368
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,073
going to let you do what you

369
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,116
want.

370
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,284
>> I want to have shelter so it

371
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,077
stays lit, Ashley.

372
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,036
How many fires have you built,

373
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,204
sweetheart?

374
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,581
>> I'm just saying.

375
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,415
I'm tired.

376
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,583
I'm hungry.

377
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,834
>> Who isn't?

378
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,918
>> I just feel like four days

379
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,587
later, we don't have anything.

380
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,754
>> I don't want to fight with

381
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,630
Ashley.

382
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,506
If she wants to fight, I can

383
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,923
give her a fight.

384
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,260
The rest of the team's great.

385
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,971
Ashley...

386
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,890
Do you need to yell?

387
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:46,515
>> No, I'm not trying to yell.

388
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,850
>> But you are.

389
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,392
>> I said, "I'm tired, I'm

390
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,018
thirsty," and you said, "Well,

391
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,769
don't you think everyone else

392
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,729
is?"

393
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,646
Of course everybody else is.

394
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,023
Did I say they weren't?

395
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,274
Why are you trying to make me

396
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,650
sound like I'm just

397
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,318
completely...

398
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,777
>> Just keep going.

399
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,403
>> Okay, that's what he want me

400
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,696
to do.

401
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,614
>> No, I don't.

402
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,281
>> Okay.

403
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,115
>> I'm not trying to finger

404
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:03,824
anybody.

405
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,658
I want the fire done.

406
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,784
You're hungry.

407
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,328
Ash, stop bitching.

408
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,537
>> I'm not bitching.

409
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,039
I just would like to eat today

410
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,081
and I think everybody else is

411
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,750
saying the same thing.

412
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,216
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

413
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,596
Prepare to get dirty.

414
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,724
Fei Long getting your first

415
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,392
look at the new Zhan Hu tribe.

416
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,727
Chicken voted out at the first

417
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,145
tribal council.

418
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,191
All right, you guys ready to

419
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,651
get to today's challenge?

420
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:38,984
>> Yeah.

421
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:39,985
>> PROBST: All right, here's how

422
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,945
it's going to work: you're

423
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,863
going to square off, three on

424
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,072
three.

425
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:43,948
I'm going to release two giant

426
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,951
wooden balls into this mud pit.

427
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,452
Your objective is to push

428
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,078
either one of those two balls

429
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,622
across your opponents' goal.

430
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,206
Each time you do, you score

431
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,958
a point for your tribe.

432
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,460
First tribe to score two points

433
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,003
wins reward.

434
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:58,504
Want to know what you're

435
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:58,921
playing for?

436
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,007
To go along with the fire,

437
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,677
fishing gear.

438
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,178
In addition, you will have a

439
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,846
fishing boat waiting for you at

440
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,473
camp.

441
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,849
There is one other twist to

442
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,309
this reward that will be

443
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,144
revealed after the challenge is

444
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,855
over.

445
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,147
Make sense?

446
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:17,982
>> Yep.

447
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,024
>> Yes.

448
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,776
>> Fei Long, because this

449
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:21,777
challenge requires equal

450
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,153
numbers of men and women, you

451
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,781
have to sit out a man.

452
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,116
James doesn't even hesitate,

453
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,826
points at Todd.

454
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,703
>> I'm the smallest out of us.

455
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,495
>> PROBST: You all right with

456
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,621
that?

457
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,414
>> Yep, let's do it.

458
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,331
>> We love you, Todd.

459
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,249
>> PROBST: Todd, you're going to

460
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:35,958
take a spot on the bench.

461
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,209
First round will be two women,

462
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,377
one man.

463
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,503
Give you a minute to

464
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,838
strategize, we'll get started.

465
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,136
Here we go.

466
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,345
Just like we like it on

467
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,014
<i>Survivor,</i> nice and wet.

468
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,434
First round, Aaron, Amanda,

469
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,895
Denise taking on Sherea, Erik

470
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,147
and Jaime.

471
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,448
Go!

472
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:15,998
Aaron's got a free shot.

473
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,333
Erik and Sherea are back on him

474
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,417
now.

475
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,169
Now it's Amanda with a free run.

476
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,422
Jaime trying to stay on her.

477
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,051
The women doing a very good job

478
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,136
for Zhan Hu.

479
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,265
Sherea takes Denise down.

480
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,144
Amanda switching balls now.

481
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,773
Nobody defending.

Jaime making her way slowly

483
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,151
towards the goal.

484
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,403
Aaron having nothing to do with

485
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,071
it.

486
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,452
Sherea now getting back in it.

487
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,870
Aaron has his arms around

488
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,164
Jaime and Sherea, takes them

489
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,167
both down in the water.

490
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,752
Amanda now trying to take

491
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,754
advantage of the situation.

492
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,673

Sherea now trying to get Amanda

494
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,845
off.

495
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,389
Denise puts both arms around

496
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,724
Jaime and pulls her out.

497
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,267
Aaron's got a free shot now.

498
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,938
Erik's going to have to defend.

499
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:21,563
Jaime pulls off Denise's shoe

500
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,399

506
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,457

Fei Long scores first goal!

512

513
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,148

baby.

539
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,111
<i>(cheers)</i>

540
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,740
>> PROBST: Fei Long,

541
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,242
congratulations.

542
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,537
Two challenges, two wins.

543
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,830
Not bad.

544
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,956
You have the ability to make

545
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,082
fire.

546
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,041
You have the tools to catch

547
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:46,333
fish.

548
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,335
It should start to change your

549
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,920
lives a little bit.

550
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,381
Now to the twist.

551
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,341
Fei Long, because you defeated

552
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,259
Zhan Hu, you now get to kidnap

553
00:18:55,342 --> 00:19:01,056
one member of their tribe.

554
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,391
That person will come and live

555
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,767
with you until the next

556
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,185
immunity challenge.

557
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,938
Who are you going to kidnap?

558
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,402
>> Jaime.

559
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,571
>> PROBST: All right, Jaime.

560
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,905
You're going to leave here now.

561
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,990
You'll go with Fei Long, live

562
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,074
at their camp.

563
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,242
You will return at the next

564
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,785
immunity challenge and rejoin

565
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,120
your tribe.

566
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:23,745
There's one more layer to this

567
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,957
twist, Jaime-- this is for you.

568
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,043
It says "open in private."

569
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,420
When you get to their beach,

570
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,755
find a private spot and read it.

571
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,840
>> Okay.

572
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,424
>> PROBST: Come get it.

573
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,262
>> Thank you.

574
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,934
>> PROBST: Zhan Hu, I got

575
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,727
nothing for you.

576
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,477
Get your stuff, head on back to

577
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,687
camp.

578
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,692
Fei Long, take your new tribe

579
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,652
member, head on back to camp.

580
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:13,712
>> I cannot believe it rained

581
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,255
this much.

582
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,298
Like, it didn't seem like it

583
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,925
rained this much, did it?

584
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:18,467
>> It looks like a natural

585
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,720
disaster hit our camp.

586
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,639
This is basically destroyed.

587
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,894
>> It's like somebody just took

588
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,812
all the water from every ocean

589
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,064
they could find and just poured

590
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,857
it right on top of us.

591
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,733
>> We actually live on the lake

592
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,692
now.

593
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,323
>> Oh, my god.

594
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,366
>> At least the bricks are

595
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,867
above the water level.

596
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,202
I'm really happy I took the

597
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,828
time to build the pit versus

598
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,956
the fire first because this just

599
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,581
goes to show that I actually had

600
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,290
a fairly sound idea and I'm

601
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,709
glad I stuck with it and I

602
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,460
think it was worth the time.

603
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,503
Keep this piece, perhaps, right

604
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,672
over here.

605
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,347
>> This is so good.

606
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,391
Fei Long.

607
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,600
>> A fishing boat.

608
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,726
>> So, who's going fishing?

609
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,727
>> You are.

610
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,478
>> We are.

611
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,396
>> Fei Long tribe.

612
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,522
At the reward challenge, we

613
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,856
won fishing gear and a fishing

614
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,899
boat.

615
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:16,525
After the challenge, we picked

616
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,403
Jaime to kidnap because she is

617
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,488
a spot of sunshine in the tribe.

618
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,865
Taking away Jaime from Zhan Hu

619
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,076
completely demoralizes them.

620
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,208
>> Yes, we got to keep track of

621
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,126
everything.

622
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,043
>> Keep track of everything,

623
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,877
because in<i> The Art of War,</i> it

624
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,837
talks about stealing things

625
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,921
from your opponent.

626
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,047
>> Todd is a sharp kid and his

627
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,257
head is in the game.

628
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,508
So I want Todd on my side

629
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,676
because I think we work well

630
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,428
together as a team.

631
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,846
>> Nice to meet you.

632
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,680
>> Jean-Robert.

633
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,307
>> Jaime.

634
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,391
>> I just got put with a

635
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,018
different tribe.

636
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:51,560
They picked me and then Jeff

637
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:56,398
gave me this to go with it.

638
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,359
"Read this note but do not open

639
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,444
the bamboo tube.

640
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,612
Before making an alliance with

641
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,281
a neighbor, you must understand

642
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,741
his intentions.

643
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,575
In this sealed tube is a clue to

644
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,202
a hidden immunity idol at the

645
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,954
enemy camp.

646
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:11,580
You must give this sealed

647
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,041
clue to a member of this

648
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,125
tribe before you rejoin your

649
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,752
own tribe at the next

650
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,587
immunity challenge."

651
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,172
The note actually has a clue for

652
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,549
the other team and it lets them

653
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,550
know where the immunity idol

654
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,596
is, so I am allowed to pick any

655
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,680
member of the team I want and

656
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,516
give it to them.

657
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,397
>> Now that's a fire.

658
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,989
>> You know, Aaron, you're quick

659
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,032
to jump on my ass about

660
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:47,866
anything.

661
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:48,492
You know that.

662
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:48,784
>> I know.

663
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,077
We don't like each other.

664
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,036
>> You're not right about that.

665
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,995
>> You like me and I don't like

666
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,913
you?

667
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:53,747
>> There you go.

668
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,415
>> Okay.

669
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,625
>> Jean-Robert and Aaron got

670
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,628
into a ridiculous bitch fight.

671
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,130
And we were all just like,

672
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:02,798
<i>(sighs),</i> "In front of the spy?

673
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,342
Really?

674
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:05,884
Are you just going to give

675
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,385
her a map of who doesn't like

676
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,345
who?

677
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:08,970
Can we not have, like, a little

678
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,305
solidarity for like two seconds

679
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:10,680
while she's here.

680
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,432
>> Let's go around the camp and

681
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,642
ask who's doing a good job.

682
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,059
>> You know what?

683
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:14,559
>> What?

684
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,229
>> I didn't want to do battle

685
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:17,813
with you, but you're making me

686
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,731
have no choice.

687
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,568
>> When I go back to my team,

688
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,986
I'm telling them, "I don't know

689
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,238
why the heck we're not winning,

690
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,280
because when I've seen what

691
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:27,781
I've seen, we should be

692
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,908
winning."

693
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,621
>> I'm going to put four

694
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,831
bricks in there and then grab

695
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,666
some of this mud and just pour

696
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,126
it in there like mortar, and it

697
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,461
will dry and be stable.

698
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,090
>> So, what should I have done?

699
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,300
>> Break up some wood.

700
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,677
>> All of this has to be broken

701
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:48,844
down.

702
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,637
All that should be broken down.

703
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,179
>> All right, let me do one

704
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:51,555
thing at a time.

705
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,473
I get overwhelmed.

706
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:53,849
I don't like that.

707
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,684
>> It's all the same thing.

708
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,518
It's the one thing.

709
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,144
I'm showing you three different

710
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,770
spots to find it, that's all.

711
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,646
>> You don't have to be mean to

712
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,480
me.

713
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,439
Why do you have to have such an

714
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:01,857
attitude sometimes?

715
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,818
>> It's not overwhelming.

716
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,153
I'm telling you where to find

717
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:06,778
the resources for the one thing

718
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,571
you're doing.

719
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,322
>> Okay, but you're doing it

720
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,699
with an attitude.

721
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,575
I don't know why, it just comes

722
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:11,867
naturally.

723
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,743
>> Okay, I apologize.

724
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,786
>> You're always like grr, grr,

725
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,787
grr.

726
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,872
>> Apologies.

727
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,957
>> Can I finish my sentence?

728
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,000
>> After you interrupted me

729
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,251
when I was talking mine?

730
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,377
>> I'm literally just asking

731
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,004
you what you want me to do.

732
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,089
>> I do think that Dave is wrong

733
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,507
in the way he talks down to

734
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,134
Ashley, telling her what to do,

735
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,552
you know?

736
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,554
You can't boss adults around,

737
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,972
really, not too much, without

738
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,557
pissing them off.

739
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,309
>> Can we both right now get

740
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,020
this pile and this pile done?

741
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,021
>> But where are we going to

742
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,230
get it done to?

743
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,273
>> I said it already this

744
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,357
morning at least a couple times.

745
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,442
>> Is there any dry place in

746
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,484
this entire area that we

747
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:46,735
could...

748
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,694
>> Think outside the box.

749
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,487
Critical and analytical

750
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:49,946
thinking really helps.

751
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,239
>> I don't need your life

752
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:51,907
lessons.

753
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,574
I just need you to tell me what

754
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:52,824
to do.

755
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,828
>> Later.

756
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,246
>><i> Adios.</i>

757
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,331
>> I believe that Dave's going

758
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,082
to shoot himself in the foot.

759
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:01,708
He's not a good leader because

760
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,626
he's the most irritating person

761
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,586
on the planet.

762
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,797
He's just so patronizing.

763
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,733
>> The last few days, I have

764
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,860
been really sick.

765
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,195
I just feel dirty.

766
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,446
I feel miserable.

767
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,030
It's just hard because I don't

768
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,740
have my Bible.

769
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,741
I know if I could read it and

770
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,576
just spend some time with God,

771
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,745
it would be great.

772
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,163
But I mean, he has me here for

773
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,957
a reason, so I'm going to keep

774
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,083
fighting.

775
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,337
>> My strategy as far as the

776
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,630
clue goes is I'm going to give

777
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,174
it to whom I think is their

778
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:51,758
weakest link, just so I keep

779
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,177
their team weaker.

780
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,653
>> Don't let anybody know you

781
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:11,861
have it.

782
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,779
>> Okay.

783
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,822
>> I feel like the Lord really

784
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,116
gave me a gift with the clue

785
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,951
to the hidden immunity idol.

786
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:22,956
Wow, this is a really big deal.

787
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,249
"Hidden immunity idol clue

788
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,126
number one.

789
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:26,751
What is thought to be hidden

790
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,379
may sometimes be seen.

791
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:29,963
Though their eyes are not,

792
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,300
yours must be keen."

793
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,175
Hmm.

794
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,635
I feel really confident that I

795
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,720
can find the hidden immunity

796
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,013
idol.

797
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,097
In the clue, it said it's

798
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,265
obvious.

799
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,349
And I think, you know, this is

800
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,517
probably something you see every

801
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,476
day and would never consider

802
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,477
that it would be a hidden

803
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,729
immunity idol.

804
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,958
>> I'm looking everywhere for

805
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,251
the hidden immunity idol,

806
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,419
looking for something that would

807
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:09,753
be obvious.

808
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,837
My mom used to always say, "If

809
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,755
it was a snake, it would have

810
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,465
bit you."

811
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,341
And I feel like that's what it's

812
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,133
like.

813
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:15,884
Like, if it was a snake, it

814
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,552
would have bit me by now.

815
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,636
I think what I really want do

816
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,971
with this information I have is

817
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,931
use it to gain's someone trust,

818
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,600
so it has to be someone who's

819
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,225
witty, somebody who can think

820
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,728
and Todd's pretty witty.

821
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,772
So, I want to team up with him.

822
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,029
>> It said that is was obvious.

823
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,864
I told Todd the idol is here.

824
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,991
So we're going to team up and

825
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,202
use it together.

826
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,536
And I trust him.

827
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,579
>> Okay.

828
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,622
Here comes some people,

829
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,581
so...

830
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,541
>> Morning, guys.

831
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,001
>> I can't believe she told me.

832
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,252
I'm in shock.

833
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,379
I would never tell anybody.

834
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,838
What was she thinking?

835
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,882
Leslie's sick, so if she goes,

836
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,509
I'll be the only one that knows

837
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,468
about it.

838
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,511
So my goal is to find that

839
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,637
thing as fast as I can, and if

840
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,679
Leslie gets sick and has to

841
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,263
leave, I'm the only one that

842
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:02,722
knows about it.

843
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,973
Fantastic.

844
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,400
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

845
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,486
Back for more punishment.

846
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:21,908
Fei Long, come on in.

847
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,334
So, Jaime, tell me about your

848
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,086
time at Fei Long.

849
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,462
>> Well, they made it the best

850
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,297
it could be, so I appreciate it.

851
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,507
>> PROBST: Jaime, your time over

852
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,508
there is done.

853
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,050
Get back over to Zhan Hu.

854
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:44,681
<i>(applause)</i>

855
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,723
You guys ready to get to

856
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,725
today's challenge?

857
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,977
First things first-- Amanda,

858
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,228
I'll take back the immunity

859
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:50,979
idol.

860
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,401
Once again, immunity is back up

861
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,819
for grabs.

862
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,320
For today's challenge, each

863
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,282
tribe will use a large Chinese

864
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:06,202
puzzle log to smash through two

865
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,787
tribe-colored walls.

866
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,539
Once you're through both walls,

867
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,124
you must then maneuver the log

868
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:11,875
through the maze carved into

869
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,793
the outside of the puzzle log.

870
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,962
First tribe to get their log

871
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,297
through the maze and ring the

872
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,091
gong wins immunity, safe from

873
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,885
tonight's tribal council.

874
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,553
Losers, another person will

875
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,804
be voted out.

876
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,514
Make sense?

877
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,974
Because this challenge runs six

878
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,435
on six, both tribes will be

879
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,644
sitting people out.

880
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,187
Zhan Hu, you have one extra

881
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,438
member.

882
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,481
Who are you going to sit out?

883
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,565
>> Jaime will sit out.

884
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,316
>> PROBST: Jaime's going to sit

885
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,066
out.

886
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,984
Fei Long, you have two extra

887
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:38,985
members, who are you going to

888
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:39,903
sit out?

889
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,529
>> Courtney and Leslie.

890
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,071
>> PROBST: Courtney and

891
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:42,906
Leslie.

892
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:43,531
Everybody else, I'll give you a

893
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,157
minute to strategize and we'll

894
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,577
get started.

895
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,203
Here we go.

896
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,787
For immunity, survivors ready.

897
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,373
Go!

898
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,138
Both tribes with good

899
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,183
rhythm.

900
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,728
Fei Long working together well.

901
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,940
Fei Long is through first.

902
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,277
Zhan Hu go.

903
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:23,947
Both tribes through.

904
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,366
Fei Long with a bit of a lead.

905
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,743
>> We got four.

906
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,202
>> Hold on, hold on.

907
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,746
Ready, one, two, three!

908
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,546
>> PROBST: Fei Long has a good

909
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:39,963
rhythm.

910
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,005
Working together well.

911
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,508
Zhan Hu wearing out.

912
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,092
Dave can barely move that log

913
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,428
anymore.

914
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,765
Frosti bringing up the rear.

915
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,350
Fei Long doing great work on

916
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,644
their wall.

917
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,062
You're through!

918
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,731
Fei Long is through.

919
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,067
>> Keep it up, guys.

920
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:02,902
>> PROBST: That log is throwing

921
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,112
Dave around.

922
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,488
Zhan Hu wearing out.

923
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,489
>> Dave, switch with me.

924
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:06,990
>> Pick it up, Dave.

925
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,866
>> PROBST: Frosti switching with

926
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,578
Dave.

927
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,120
Dave, get a hold of the log.

928
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:12,954
Get it.

929
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,331
You're still in it!

930
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,666
Fei Long working together as a

931
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,626
tribe.

932
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,961
>> Get it up there, get it up

933
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,004
there.

934
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:21,921
>> Listen to Aaron.

935
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,757
Listen to Aaron.

936
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,468
>> PROBST: You guys need dig

937
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,511
deep.

938
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,721
Let's go.

939
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,597
There you go.

940
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,556
You're through.

941
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,474
Zhan Hu's through.

942
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,350
>> Come on, guys!

943
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,727
You guys better run.

944
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,438
>> PROBST: Fei Long already

945
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,355
working.

946
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,023
Zhan Hu now catching up.

947
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,239
It only goes through one way.

948
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,699
>> Keep going around.

949
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,617
>> PROBST: Fei Long with a bit

950
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,492
of a lead.

951
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,036
Zhan Hu trying to catch up.

952
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,000
Fei Long reaches a dead end.

953
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,544
They got to back it up now.

954
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,212
>> Forward, back, back, back.

955
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,757
>> PROBST: Zhan Hu now in the

956
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,132
lead.

957
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,258
>> Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

958
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,344
>> PROBST: Fei Long taking their

959
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,970
time.

960
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,389
Nobody panicking on Fei Long.

961
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,977
>> It's a dead end here.

962
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,854
>> PROBST: Zhan Hu reaches a

963
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:20,730
dead end.

964
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,314
>> Left.

965
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,607
>> There, go back.

966
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,775
>> PROBST: Fei Long in the lead

967
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:23,983
again.

968
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:24,525
Keep moving, Zhan Hu, keep

969
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,694
moving!

970
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,282
Zhan Hu falling behind.

971
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,242
Fei Long is very close.

972
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,077
Fei Long is through.

973
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,206
Fei Long wins immunity!

974
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,755
All right.

975
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,381
Fei Long, once again, immunity

976
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,216
is yours.

977
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,012
<i>(applause)</i>

978
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,223
Nobody going home from Fei Long.

979
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,099
Zhan Hu, all I got for you is

980
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,226
another date with me tonight at

981
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,769
tribal council, where one of the

982
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,562
seven of you will be voted out

983
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,814
of this game.

984
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,898
You have the afternoon to

985
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:04,524
figure out who it's going to be.

986
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,900
Head on back to camp.

987
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,235
See you at tribal.

988
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,737
Fei Long, head on out, guys.

989
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,114
Nice work.

990
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,767
>> I feel really bad because,

991
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,310
you know, we blew it today, and

992
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,647
I feel like I let the tribe

993
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,982
down.

994
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:46,524
Can I say something really

995
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,233
quick?

996
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,736
Please?

997
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:50,903
I apologize.

998
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,572
I feel like I let us down today

999
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,240
because I lost my footing and I

1000
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,325
lost my rhythm, trying to get

1001
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,661
my rhythm back, I lost my power.

1002
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,620
>> Dave, you tried, but you

1003
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,663
know what...

1004
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,706
>> I'm sorry.

1005
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,290
And Frosti, thank you so much

1006
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,625
for stepping up and seeing what

1007
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,793
was happening and switching

1008
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,961
with me.

1009
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:07,545
I take full responsibility for

1010
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,255
the challenge today.

1011
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,966
At the same time, the last six

1012
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,801
days haven't been about one

1013
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,969
challenge.

1014
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:15,553
It's been about day in and day

1015
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,431
out in camp and how you

1016
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,640
contribute and what your

1017
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,434
attitude's like.

1018
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,525
I'm fairly confident how things

1019
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,319
are going to go this evening.

1020
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,320
You know, you reap what you sew.

1021
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,739
Nothing's carved in stone yet,

1022
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,990
but I'm pretty confident I'm

1023
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,742
not going home.

1024
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,332
>> I know that Dave is voting

1025
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,167
for me at tonight's tribal

1026
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,502
council.

1027
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,294
At this point, I see my options

1028
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,838
are this: I can either confront

1029
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,799
everybody, act like a crazy

1030
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,175
woman and say<i> (inaudible)</i>

1031
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,552
and make myself look like an

1032
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,471
idiot, or I could keep my head

1033
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,347
together, go to tribal council

1034
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,891
and tell everyone, like, "Look,

1035
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,476
Dave is a crazy person."

1036
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,980
>> I feel like if there's such

1037
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,566
conflict with Dave and Ashley,

1038
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,859
you know, if people are

1039
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,360
targeting Ashley for that

1040
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,320
reason, I guess it also makes

1041
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,030
Dave a target.

1042
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,531
If you had to pick between

1043
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,534
those two, you might think

1044
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,159
Dave, but I still see him as

1045
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,745
strong.

1046
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,717
Remove one of them and the

1047
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,261
other one can stay around.

1048
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,430
See what I'm saying?

1049
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,181
It's probably dead even

1050
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,684
between Ashley and Dave.

1051
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,226
It puts me in a hard place

1052
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,228
because Ashley is my friend,

1053
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,479
but then Dave's such hard worker

1054
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,272
and he knows what he's doing out

1055
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:49,772
here.

1056
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,398
So I'm not really sure what's

1057
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,150
going to happen tonight.

1058
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,807
>> PROBST: So, last time we

1059
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,850
were here, we did a little

1060
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,768
tribe therapy, and it appeared

1061
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,562
that you had at least one

1062
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,438
leader, maybe two.

1063
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,647
Frosti, how is that leadership

1064
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,940
working out?

1065
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,442
>> Well, Dave's really stepped

1066
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,526
up.

1067
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,986
He was already giving some

1068
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,404
leadership-type demands, and

1069
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,405
he's really trying to do

1070
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:39,697
everything.

1071
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,532
At times, I fear he may attempt

1072
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,034
too much.

1073
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,745
>> It's a hard habit to kick.

1074
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,662
>> PROBST: Ashley, you were

1075
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,456
rolling your eyes.

1076
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,582
>> Well, Dave and I kind of

1077
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,542
butt heads sort of.

1078
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,501
Our personalities just don't

1079
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,961
mesh well.

1080
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,630
But I respect him as a leader,

1081
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,714
and when I have questions, I'll

1082
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:57,840
ask them, even if I'm not

1083
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,217
supposed to.

1084
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:00,801
>> PROBST: And Dave, that rubs

1085
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,345
you the wrong way?

1086
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:02,970
>> It doesn't rub me the wrong

1087
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,346
way at all.

1088
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,347
Everyone is totally welcome to

1089
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,182
ask questions.

1090
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,350
If you're unclear on something,

1091
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,851
then please do ask.

1092
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,019
Because all I want to do is get

1093
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,896
camp life fully squared away.

1094
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:12,480
>> I don't expect Dave to say,

1095
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,398
"Well, yeah, that's the way it's

1096
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:14,607
been."

1097
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,692
That's what he does-- he goes

1098
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,194
off on rants and patronizes and

1099
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,362
talks down to you and treats

1100
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,364
you like a child.

1101
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,573
>> PROBST: Ashley, do you think

1102
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,450
this is just about you, or do

1103
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,743
you notice it with other people,

1104
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,661
as well?

1105
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,536
>> I notice that other people

1106
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,329
have a problem with it as well.

1107
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,248
Dave talks in circles a lot,

1108
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:31,832
and he always wants to be the

1109
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,751
martyr.

1110
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,503
The way he handles that

1111
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,504
leadership, it's just, for me,

1112
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,965
it's intolerable.

1113
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,091
>> I'm incredibly rusty at

1114
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,217
leadership, too.

1115
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,218
This is a brand new boat for

1116
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,094
me.

1117
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,470
It's been a long time.

1118
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,472
>> PROBST: Jaime, is there a

1119
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,684
chance Dave's trying to prove

1120
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,729
too much versus lead the tribe?

1121
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,481
>> I think Dave is definitely

1122
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,732
over the top trying to prove

1123
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,900
himself.

1124
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,277
I mean, you wake up and there's

1125
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,361
already wood coming and it's

1126
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,570
just, like, whoa, you know, slow

1127
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,698
down for a second.

1128
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,907
>> PROBST: Jaime, what does

1129
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,659
this tribe need to do?

1130
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,952
>> I personally think most of

1131
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,452
us all get along.

1132
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,206
These two just clash heads, and

1133
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,458
I think sometimes the way you

1134
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,459
phrase your demands, it might

1135
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,919
intimidate people.

1136
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,129
>> I've also asked everyone

1137
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,381
here to check me if I have.

1138
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,716
>> See, already, defense mode.

1139
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,426
>> I'm out of line, please

1140
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,343
check me because I need it.

1141
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,804
>> For me, I know we have work

1142
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,388
to do, but I haven't enjoyed

1143
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,016
almost a single moment since

1144
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,225
I've been here.

1145
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:31,726
I barely know any of these

1146
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,435
people.

1147
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,519
I know Ashley, I know Jaime.

1148
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,396
I'm dying to know Erik a little

1149
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,647
better, but the other three, I

1150
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,690
couldn't even tell you their

1151
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,983
last names.

1152
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,026
>> We're always working our

1153
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,235
butts off.

1154
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:42,319
>> That's my... did you not hear

1155
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,571
what came out of my mouth?

1156
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,781
Did you not hear what came out

1157
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,365
of my mouth?

1158
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,826
Never once have we sat down as

1159
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,161
a tribe to talk about, well

1160
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:50,703
what do we want to do as a

1161
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,370
tribe?

1162
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,205
How are we going to make this

1163
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,040
come together?

1164
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,540
How are we going to win?

1165
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,459
Perfect example, again, Ashley,

1166
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,169
every time she says something,

1167
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,712
you have a comment back.

1168
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,588
>> And now look what happened.

1169
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,298
Now I'm on the chopping block.

1170
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,718
>> PROBST: Ashley, what's the

1171
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,470
criteria for your vote tonight?

1172
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:11,098
>> I'm voting for Dave.

1173
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:11,932
>> I expect more than one vote

1174
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,225
tonight.

1175
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:13,809
>> PROBST: Dave, how would the

1176
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,602
tribe be better if it's Ashley

1177
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,271
that's voted out tonight?

1178
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,189
>> There will be a heck of a

1179
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,731
lot less eggshells to walk

1180
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,358
around on.

1181
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,568
I only have conflict with

1182
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,112
Ashley.

1183
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,322
>> PROBST: Well, once again

1184
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:26,947
we've had another good session

1185
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,657
of tribe therapy.

1186
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,825
It's time to vote.

1187
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,327
Erik, you're up.

1188
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,762
>> In a different setting and

1189
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:50,304
circumstance, you might be

1190
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:52,056
having<i> (inaudible).</i>

1191
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,516
I wish you the best of luck.

1192
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,233
>> I'm voting for Derek

1193
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,400
Zoolander.

1194
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,985
Oh, I mean Dave.

1195
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,792
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1196
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,460
votes.

1197
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,473
Once the votes are read, the

1198
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,475
decision is final.

1199
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,560
The person voted out will be

1200
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,102
asked to leave the tribal

1201
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:38,644
council area immediately.

1202
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,770
I'll read the votes.

1203
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,069
First vote, Ashley.

1204
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,615
Dave.

1205
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,118
One vote Ashley, one vote Dave.

1206
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,914
Ashley.

1207
00:40:58,998 --> 00:40:59,748
Two votes Ashley, one vote Dave.

1208
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,754
Ashley.

1209
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,006
Three votes Ashley, one vote

1210
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,592
Dave.

1211
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:12,887
Second person voted out of

1212
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,681
<i>Survivor: China,</i> Ashley.

1213
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,891
That's four, that's enough.

1214
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,309
You need to bring me your torch.

1215
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,523
>> I'll see you soon.

1216
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,613
>> PROBST: Ashley, the tribe has

1217
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,780
spoken.

1218
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,162
Time to go.

1219
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,631
Grab your torches.

1220
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,673
Head back the camp.

1221
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,092
Good night.

1222
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,195
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1223
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:11,862
from our next episode.

1224
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,407

1225
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,659
<i>Survivor:</i>

1226
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,245
Dave loses patience with Zhan

1227
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,204
Hu.

1228
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,956
>> It's not rocket science.

1229
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,332
>> PROBST: At Fei Long...

1230
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,333
>> Courtney, of course, is going

1231
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,417
to be first to go.

1232
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,293
>> PROBST: ...Todd and Courtney

1233
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:26,919
hear more than they bargain for.

1234
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,004
>> Dude, she's right here.

1235
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,172
>> PROBST: ...and the game gets

1236
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,298
even more brutal.

1245
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,143
because of a personal conflict

1246
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,479
with our leader, and Dave is

1247
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:46,063
going to show them the reason

1248
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,065
that he shouldn't be in

1249
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:48,691
control, and I guarantee you

1250
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,985
that I'll see him on the flip

1251
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:51,652
side way sooner than he

1252
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,737
imagines.

1253
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,905
Dave, if I had one word to

1254
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,614
describe him, he'd be "tool."

1255
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,699
Because that is the perfect word

1256
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,742
for him, he's a tool.
