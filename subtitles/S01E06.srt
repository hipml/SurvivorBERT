JEFF PROBST:
<i>16 Americans forced</i>
<i>to abandon ship</i>

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,257
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China Sea.</i>

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,595
<i>Marooned for 39 days,</i>
<i>they must work together</i>

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,891
<i>to build shelter, find food</i>
<i>and survive the island,</i>

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,228
<i>but, ultimately,</i>
<i>it is everyone for themselves.</i>

6
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,107
<i>Every third night, they will</i>
<i>hike deep into the jungle</i>

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,942
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the Tribal Council,</i>

8
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,903
<i>where they must vote one</i>
<i>of their own off the island.</i>

9
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>only one will remain</i>

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>and will leave the island</i>
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

11
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,624
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor:

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,293
<i>Tensions at Tagi Tribe</i>
<i>were on the rise.</i>

13
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,003
SUSAN:
<i>You guys wasted three days</i>

14
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,337
fishing during the day.

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,338
It wasn't a waste.

16
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,465
Did you catch anything?

17
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,466
No, ma'am.

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,009
It was a waste of time, then.

19
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,969
It's expected
to get on each other's nerves.

20
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,139
JEFF:
<i>While at Pagong,</i>
<i>the mood was downcast.</i>

21
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,224
GRETCHEN:
<i>I think the camp looks trashy.</i>

22
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,768
Something has to happen
to make

23
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,311
<i>everybody decide to pitch in.</i>

24
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,520
JEFF:
<i>But at the reward challenge,</i>

25
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,357
<i>Pagong rebounded by winning</i>
<i>a special food prize.</i>

26
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,484
Chicken!

27
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,485
Are you kidding me?

28
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,652
(<i> screaming</i> )

29
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,321
It's so awesome
we got chickens.

30
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,866
JEFF:
<i>And a romance</i>
<i>began to bloom.</i>

31
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,326
Colleen has joined me
in the forest to sleep.

32
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,994
JENNA:
<i>I noticed they seemed to be</i>

33
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,954
<i>spending their nights</i>
<i>out under the stars.</i>

34
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,206
I think it's a little romance
going on.

35
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,290
It's all about sex.

36
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,961
JEFF:
<i>Back at Tagi,</i>
<i>Dirk was running on empty.</i>

37
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,171
You're looking like hell.

38
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,464
DIRK:
<i>I've lost a lot of muscle mass,</i>

39
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,673
<i>a lot of strength.</i>

40
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,051
JEFF:
<i>And his tribe</i>
<i>thought they had</i>

41
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,469
<i>the immunity challenge</i>
<i>wrapped up.</i>

42
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,638
We need one rower,
and the rest of us swimming.

43
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,722
I'm a commercial

44
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,349
<i>white-water raft guide.</i>

45
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,726
<i>I know Gervase can't swim,</i>
<i>but my guess</i>

46
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>is that they'll put him</i>
<i>in the boat, rowing.</i>

47
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,730
I could beat him
any day of the week.

48
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,274
JEFF:
<i>But their overconfidence</i>
<i>cost them dearly.</i>

49
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,527
Is that what
you wanted, Jeff?

50
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,695
I got beat by a guy
who couldn't even swim.

51
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,365
JEFF:
<i>Their loss sent them</i>
<i>back to Tribal Council,</i>

52
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,909
<i>where the voting alliance</i>
<i>reared its ugly head.</i>

53
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,328
Dirk, the tribe
has spoken.

54
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,874
<i>11 castaways remain.</i>

55
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,751
<i>Who will be voted off</i>
<i>tonight?</i>

56
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,611
It's day 16 on the island

57
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,822
and the survivors are starting
to plan for their future.

58
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,992
<i>Until now, the two tribes</i>
<i>have been adversaries.</i>

59
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:21,659
We got it,
we got it.

60
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,662
(<i> all cheering</i> )

61
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,956
<i>They built separate societies</i>

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,584
<i>and have established</i>
<i>their own routines.</i>

63
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,294
<i>But in the game of</i> Survivor

64
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,171
<i>everything must change.</i>

65
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,756
<i>Three days from now</i>

66
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,966
<i>the two tribes will be forced</i>

67
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,260
<i>to merge into</i>
<i>a single new tribe.</i>

68
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,137

<i>along old tribal lines</i>
<i>after the merger,</i>

70
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,934
<i>or will it be everyone</i>

71
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,354

RICHARD:
<i>This is an interesting point</i>

77
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,522
right on the verge of the merge.

78
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,357
Two nights before we merge,
it's an interesting time.

79
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,610
<i>Change is coming,</i>
<i>as they say.</i>

80
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,534
KELLY:
<i>I think it'll be cool</i>
<i>when we merge.</i>

81
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,703
I think they're nice people.

82
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,579
I don't think they're
taking this... seriously.

83
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:54,585
<i>They're playing</i> Island 90210.

84
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,047
<i>They think that they'll go</i>
<i>to their little mud volcano</i>

85
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,174
<i>and give each other facials</i>

86
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,884
and they don't need
to really do anything

87
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,593
because they're just here to...

88
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,388

89
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,224
SUSAN:
<i>They better send them</i>
<i>with some supplies,</i>

90
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,226
<i>that's all I can say.</i>

91
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,105
There's three of them
that we need out of here.

92
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,106
Greg.

93
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,941
Greg, definitely.

94
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,152
<i>He's just</i> way<i> too psychotic.</i>

95
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,405
The other one is
speedball-- Jenna.

96
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,906
She can get old
pretty quickly.

97
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,743
SUSAN:
<i>She... yeah, she's going to</i>
<i>grow old real fast on us.</i>

98
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,911
Gervase. He's a pervert.

99

<i>He's gone.</i>

100
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,958
And the chickens
all better be dead

101
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,044

T-minus one hour.

We're going to wait
till about another hour

106
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,476
and then we're
going to chop their head off.

107
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,521
We'll take
the little nasty one first.

108
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,608

I don't enjoy killing things.

118
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,342
It's not, like,
a thrill to kill something,

119
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,802
but anybody who eats meat

120
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,677

If you're going to

I hit the end of
the bones and
the marrow...

171
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,088
There's really a lot
of protein in there.

172
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,799
GRETCHEN:
<i>I think, mentally,</i>
<i>the chicken was more important</i>

173
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,051
<i>than it was physically.</i>

174
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,260
We have three
chickens.

175
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,304
After we're done
eating those...

176
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,514
we're back on track.

177
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,065
RICHARD:
<i>It's funny when I hear</i>

178
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,942
<i>"How come you're naked</i>
<i>all the time?"</i>

179
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,236
I'm naked less than one percent
of the time.

180
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,737
I'd like to be naked
all the time.

181
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,198
That would be smarter
in this 100-degree weather.

182
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,993
(<i> laughing</i> )

183
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,453
Richard's naked.

184
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,872
Is he naked?

185
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,584
KELLY:
<i>He walks around naked</i>
<i>quite a bit.</i>

186
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,336
I think it probably
bugs some of the guys.

187
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,505
Seems kind of childish
and immature to me

188
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,965
and kind of grandstanding

189
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,716
and walking around
on national TV.

190
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,261
Your life, my life,
different things-- who cares?

191
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,012
Something like that.

192
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,306
RUDY:
<i>He runs around pretty often</i>
<i>without clothes on</i>

193
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:17,682
and he don't
think nothing of it.

194
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,767
Peachy.

195
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,311
I couldn't care less whether
guys or girls are around.

196
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,980
It doesn't make any difference.

197
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,981
If there's any horny gay men
out there

198
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,858
that want a horny guy in return,
I know one.

199
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,152
Naked isn't sexual to me,
and it doesn't...

200
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,656
I don't think of it that way,
it doesn't faze me that way

201
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,825
so, no,
I'm pretty comfortable naked.

202
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,494
RUDY:
<i>I don't agree</i>
<i>with his lifestyle</i>

203
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,370
and I told him that,

204
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,622
and he probably
don't agree with mine.

205
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,128
<i>But, anyway,</i>
<i>we</i> got<i> to work together</i>

206
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,505
up until this merger, anyway.

207
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,631
There's money
at stake.

208
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,799
We're all
trying to win...

209
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,302
uh, the pot.

210
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,845
RUDY:
<i>I finally went along</i>
<i>with this alliance</i>

211
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,722
<i>and if I didn't,</i>
<i>I'd be out of here</i>

212
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,559
probably the next vote
or the one after.

213
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,479
I think, with an alliance
that we establish here,

214
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,565
we can do very, very well.

215
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,691
If you don't, you're out.
That's all there is to it.

216
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,527
Exactly. Tell me what
option you have.

217
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,820
RICHARD:
<i>I've been trying to support</i>
<i>keeping Rudy from day one.</i>

218
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,532
I want to bring him along
to the next round where...

219
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,242
he won't care much

220
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,162
and probably will get voted off
before, uh... winning.

221
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,913
You think they
wouldn't do it to us?

222
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,498
No, of course
they would.

223
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,875
RICHARD:
<i>I don't think</i>

224
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,127
somebody's in control
of our group, in particular.

225
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,670
I think...

226
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,673
I'm in control of...

227
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,051
who's being voted off

228
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,886
and I think that's all
that matters to me.

229
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,598
(<i> quiet talking</i> )

230
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,736
(<i> giggling</i> )

236
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,044
Morning, Gretchen.

237
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,436
GERVASE:
<i>I made a totally dumb</i>
<i>statement now that I regret.</i>

238
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,437
You know,
it was kind of just

239
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,273
a poke at the girls,
give them a little shot.

240
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,775
JENNA:
<i>He sets it up first</i>

241
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,113
with "Don't take offense
to this,<i> but</i> women are

242
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,615
the stupidest things
on the planet next to cows."

243
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,575
"Girls are the stupidest
thing on the planet

244
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,785
next to cows" was the remark.

245
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,786
(<i> shrieks</i> )

246
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,329
You called us stupid.

247
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,705
Who? Not me.

248
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,582
Don't get me in this.

249
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,000
The whole context
of the story was--

250
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,001
we were talking
about relationships

251
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,003
and how guys and girls
will do stupid things

252
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,922
if you like the person.

253
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,090
Oh, we never
got around

254
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,633
to the stupid
things guys do.

255
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,635
If you like somebody
that much, you'll do

256
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,178
something stupid
you should maybe not do.

257
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,930
We're not as stupid as cows,
we're a step above.

258
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,141
GRETCHEN:
<i>Well, I said,</i>

259
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,851
"You know, Gervase,
I told those girls

260
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,519
"that all they had to do

261
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,647
"was, like, when they write
your name on that piece of paper

262
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,274
"and hold it up to the camera

263
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,152
they can look straight
into the lens and go, 'moo.'"

264
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,988
His mouth dropped open
like he had never considered

265
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,824
that maybe that was not
the best thing to say

266
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,992
to a woman who had
that much power over him.

267
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,954
No, I'm being very apologetic
because it was stupid.

268
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,998
I mean... a-after I said it,
you know, I could...

269
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,999
after I said it...

270
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,877
The remorse
he showed...

271
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,962
He was, like, in this box
with no fricking way out.

272
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,589
Blah-blah, blah-blah, blah-blah.

273
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,465
She was there
to hear it.

274
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,216
If you let them talk
long enough,

275
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,050
they'll probably
get you out of the box.

276
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,219
GERVASE:
They probably will.

277
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,721
They're good for that.

278
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,348
Gervase is...
He's on a free ride, man.

279
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,850
He's untouchable.

280
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,852
I don't know
how he gets through.

281
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,980
He called the women cows.

282
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,357
<i>He doesn't do stuff</i>
<i>half the time.</i>

283
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,360
GERVASE:
<i>I haven't done</i>

284
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,531
a thing out here since
I've been here, it seems like,

285
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,033
and that's cool.

286
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,536
<i>Joel does the fishing.</i>

287
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,163
<i>He does the paddling.</i>

288
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,165
I'm just out there
hanging on the raft with him.

289
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,210
The expert fisherman that I am.

290
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,002
When they built
that hut on the beach,

291
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,921
I was nowhere near there.

292
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,756
I was in the shade somewhere.

293
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,091
<i>You know, I was looking</i>
<i>for a coconut or something.</i>

294
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,886
<i>I think everybody</i>
<i>has done cooking rice</i>

295
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,430
<i>at one point in time.</i>

296
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,890
I have yet to cook anything.

297
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,687
JENNA:
<i>I didn't see him</i>
<i>do anything yesterday,</i>

298
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,191
<i>but that is nothing new,</i>
<i>and that surprises me</i>

299
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,693
that I still haven't
voted for Gervase.

300
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,531
<i>He doesn't seem</i>
<i>to pull his own weight,</i>

301
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,699
<i>and I know for a fact</i>
<i>that he voted against me,</i>

302
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,743
so why the hell
haven't I voted for him?

303
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,371
<i>I don't know.</i>

304
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,038
GERVASE:
I knew coming here
was all about

305
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,082
charm and personality.

306
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,583
That will get me through.

307
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,588
<i>His charm</i> does
<i>get him through, you know,</i>

308
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,131
but he hasn't been
so charming today,

309
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,174
so maybe
he's going to get the vote.

310
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,808
JEFF:
<i>The Tagi Tribe</i>

311
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,976
<i>has lost the last two</i>
<i>reward challenges</i>

312
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,104
<i>and they're growing</i>
<i>more hungry each day,</i>

313
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,065
<i>but tonight there is another</i>
<i>reward challenge, for food.</i>

314
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,819
My guess is this is a clue.

315
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,445
"There once was a base
on this island

316
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,407
"where the soldiers
were known for stockpilin'.

317
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,993
"The Army's left town,
but their stuff's still around.

318
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,078
Move fast and you
may go home smilin'."

319
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,955
Probably a map.

320
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,415
Oh, there's
food in here.

321
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,958
We'll be able to eat it
for dinner. Come on.

322
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,001
It's still
dinnertime.

323
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:39,461
You never know.

324
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,130
What do you
think it is?

325
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,299
Smell anything yet?

326
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,093
Stewed tomatoes. That'd suck.

327
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,137
Looks like dog food.

328
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,055
Aw, dog food, man!

329
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,474
Dog food. That's what
I said right away.

330
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,851
Smells good, though.

331
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,644
That is definitely dog food.

332
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,103
Let me see.

333
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,105
Oh, yeah, Alpo.

334
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,273
Come on, Rich.

335
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,524
Yeah, it smells
like beef stew.

336
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,984
Come on, just taste it.

337
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,526
Just taste
a little bit.

338
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,027
You don't want some?

339
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,112
No.

340
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,196
Yeah! Go, Rich.

341
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,658
Wow.

342
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,368
All right.

343
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,369
Oh!

344
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,621
Yeah!

345
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,876
It might be ravioli.

346
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,712
GERVASE:
It could be some natural thing
from the island, man.

347
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,963
Larvae in tomato sauce.

348
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,173
Nice.

349
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,049
We don't know
if this even<i> is</i> food.

350
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,467
Maybe just water.

351
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,305
I think it's chili.

352
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,225
Um...

353
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,813
I mean, I could think
it would be dog food.

354
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,148
I-I think
it might be dog food.

355
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,025
GERVASE:
We've just eaten good chicken.

356
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,193
I'm not going
to ruin that chicken

357
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,195
with damn dog food.

358
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,196
GREG:
Go for it.

359
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,447
It's dog food.

360
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,242
Purina Chow-Chow.

361
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,662
No, I would say Alpo.

362
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,371
Make your coat
nice and shiny.

363
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,665
Yeah, your hair
will look good.

364
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,208
Here, take a
taste. Be a man.

365
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,919
Put your finger in
there and eat it.

366
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,712
Are you going
to eat it with me?

367
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,713
Oh, cool.

368
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,716
That's gravy, actually.

369
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,510
You'll want to cook it
the whole way.

370
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,928
I don't
understand.

371
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,179
It's just dog food.

372
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,722
What if it's<i> dog?</i>

373
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,057
GREG:
<i>I choose my preservatives</i>

374
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,393
<i>and chemicals wisely,</i>
<i>and that really would</i>

375
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,436
have thrown
everything off-balance.

376
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,772
I just don't
recognize most of it.

377
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,483
I don't recognize
any of it, actually.

378
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,235
Over saltines,
it's like pate.

379
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,779
JOEL:
<i>Your standards</i>
<i>definitely, definitely</i>

380
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,239
<i>take a dive when you come</i>

381
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,865
into a situation like this.

382
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,575
When you get hungry,
you'll eat anything.

383
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,744
I took a good
four or five bites

384
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,413
and I'm...
I'm good. You?

385
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,706
Yeah, I'm done.

386
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,040
You're done.

387
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,258
JEFF:
<i>At tonight's reward challenge,</i>
<i>we're going to find out</i>

388
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,552
<i>just how motivated</i>
<i>our hungry tribes are.</i>

389
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,431
<i>During World War II,</i>

390
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,600
<i>this area was a hot spot</i>
<i>of military activity.</i>

391
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,853
<i>So, the premise</i>
<i>of this challenge:</i>

392
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,607
<i>Fleeing troops have just</i>
<i>abandoned their barracks</i>

393
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,776
<i>and left behind</i>
<i>some very useful items...</i>

394
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,902
<i>two can openers...</i>

395
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,487
<i>two pocketknives...</i>

396
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,573
<i>and two Army helmets.</i>

397
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,949
One member
from each tribe

398
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:14,950
will go
in together.

399
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,160
You'll have
a flashlight.

400
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,411
You'll look for these items.

401
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,288
You can only find
one item per person.

402
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,583
You come back out,
you hand off the flashlight,

403
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,459
which sort of acts like a baton,

404
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,334
to the next person
and they go in.

405
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,462
Be careful.

406
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,297
If you bring back
a duplicate item

407
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,633
your tribe will
be disqualified.

408
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,637
Here's a little bit about what
you're playing for tonight.

409
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,139
We've got some good canned food.

410
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,933
Peas, some tuna,

411
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:40,934
a little dessert.

412
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,144
Is that chocolate?

413
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,645
That is chocolate.

414
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,314
First tribe back

415
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,483
with all the items
on the list wins.

416
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,610
You guys ready?

417
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,320
The tribe
is ready!

418
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,657
Go!

419
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,326
Go, Jenna. All
right, all right.

420
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,786
Hey, don't
knock her down.

421
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,350
I have the
Army helmet.

422
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,822
We're close. Here.

423
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,031
I have the Army helmet.

424
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,504
White can opener, pocketknife.

425
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,521
I got the pocketknife.

426
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,731
We need the can opener.

427
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,858
Take the list.

428
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,359
Can opener, can opener.

429
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,777
Can opener, Rich!

430
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,631
Rich! Gervase
found the
can opener!

431
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,633
Run, run,
run! Run! Move!

432
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,732
(<i> cheering</i> )

433
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,941
No!

434
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,443
The can opener?

435
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,278
Bummer.

436
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,780
I think we got
some bad news.

437
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,282
Thank you, Rich,
thank you.

438
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,618
A pocketknife.

439
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,912
Tough break. You thought
you had the can opener.

440
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,956
You actually had the second
knife, Pagong's knife.

441
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,957
It goes to them.

442
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,083
That's your
three items.

443
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,084
Victory for Pagong.

444
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,502
(<i> cheering</i> )

445
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,632
It's over.

446
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,384
(<i> cheering and shrieking</i> )

447
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,762
Chocolate!

448
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,471
None for you!

449
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,432
Hey.

450
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,601
JEFF:
Tagi.

451
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,145
Sorry, once again,
it's a winner-take-all.

452
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,688
Pagong, once again,
you're taking all.

453
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,149
Some M.R.E.S, some canned food

454
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,860
and this, which you might want
to keep away from the fire

455
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,612
'cause it will
melt very fast.

456
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,739
And from Jenna.

457
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,034
There goes
the midnight snack.

458
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,998
Good night, guys.

459
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,416
Good night.

460
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,408
We are so close
right now to being
the final six

461
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,534
people here.

462
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,203
It's right there.

463
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,913
Now it's looking
like this is...

464
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,665
actually could
happen, like

465
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,874
one of us
could actually walk away

466
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,584
with $1 million,
out of our team.

467
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,380
One more win
and it's in the bag.

468
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,090
JOEL:
When they do merge these tribes,

469
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,842
if we're not sticking together
as a team,

470
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,719
they're just going to
pick us off one by one.

471
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,720
I just know it's
going to happen.

472
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,556
Tomorrow, we'll just...
all of us have to say

473
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,433
either, yes, we're going to
stick together or no, we're not.

474
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,235
We have to win
the next immunity
challenge bad.

475
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:03,071
We have to really
concentrate and win.

476
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,906
We need six and
they need four

477
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,533
so we can vote them off.

478
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,326
GERVASE:
We need to stick together,
really,

479
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,954
as Pagong, still,
and just wipe them out.

480
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,873
Just pick them off
one by one.

481
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,250
JOEL:
Colleen-- she said
that she does not want to vote

482
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,419
anybody on our team off
until all of their team is gone.

483
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,795
We want to stick together.

484
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,422
<i>Jenna also has said</i>
<i>that she is not</i>

485
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,257
<i>going to vote anybody</i>
<i>on our team off.</i>

486
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,925
<i>Greg said openly that he's not</i>

487
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:24,676
<i>going to vote anybody</i>
<i>on the team off.</i>

488
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,055
<i>Gervase has said it openly.</i>

489
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,431
I've said it
numerous times openly.

490
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,434
I've never heard Gretchen say

491
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,311
<i>"I want to keep</i>
<i>this team together."</i>

492
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,729
What do you
think, Gretchen?

493
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,609
GRETCHEN:
<i>I don't see myself</i>
<i>joining a voting alliance,</i>

494
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,819
but if it's somebody
that I'm thinking of voting off,

495
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,362
that would be great.

496
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,073
I'll vote along
with everybody else.

497
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,574
If we win,
and we go in with an advantage,

498
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,285
we just all got
to stick together,

499
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,954
stay as a team like
we've been doing all the while.

500
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:53,955
Joel seems to be ignoring
the fact

501
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,083
that we have one more
immunity challenge

502
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,584
before we combine the tribes,

503
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,044
<i>and if we lose it,</i>

504
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,922
<i>somebody's being voted off,</i>
<i>and he talked</i> way<i> too much</i>

505
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,883
<i>about what he's going to do</i>
<i>when the tribes are combined</i>

506
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,135
the strategy, the combination--
da-da-da.

507
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,805
What if he doesn't make it
to the combining of the tribes?

508
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,806
I know that ladies' man

509
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,266
has irritated every woman
in this tribe, so...

510
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,311
JOEL:
<i>I'm not a chauvinist.</i>

511
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,480
I believe that a woman can do
anything a man can do.

512
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,857
Joel thinks
he's the all-American

513
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,526
and all
of these physical challenges

514
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,819
are just feeding his ego.

515
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,657
Go ahead. If you want to compete
with me, I'm fine with it.

516
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,828
Oh, my.

517
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,121
I haven't wrecked anything,

518
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,124
I haven't broken anything,
I haven't lost any competitions.

519
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,292
You know, he's Golden Boy.
He's Mr. January--

520
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,544
<i>he's going to have a calendar.</i>

521
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,297
(<i> all cheering</i> )

522
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,466
He's Captain America, really.

523
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,635
I can't really think
of anything that I've done

524
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,221
<i>that's bad.</i>

525
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,808
Towards us ladies, he seems
to be pretty condescending

526
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,145
like, he has to explain
everything so thoroughly

527
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,356
that we just couldn't
understand it without Joel.

528
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,484
Throw it over there
and then kind of tie it
to one of these things.

529
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,028
Let's just try it
like this first.

530
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,364
I know that gamy taste
is going to be pretty harsh.

531
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,491
I don't see
why he feels the need

532
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,827
to treat us like we're children.

533
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,036
I wouldn't pry
with that.

534
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,538
I wouldn't pry
with the tip of that.

535
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,998
We have a butter knife
over there?

536
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,000
He is full of, "Don't do this,"

537
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,669
"Put it here," "do that,"
"Watch out," da-da-da.

538
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,795
Well, then, get up and do it.

539
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,218
<i>You can't be a woman</i>
<i>who's strong enough</i>

540
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,513
to volunteer to come here
and take what comes...

541
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,599
You want me
to get that for you?

542
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,185
<i>...and then overlook a comment</i>

543
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,061
like he doesn't trust you
to cook the rice.

544
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,897
Have we been
throwing the water

545
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,524
and the rice in there
all at one time?

546
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,609
Yeah. Why?

547
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,235
I just wondered.

548
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,196
Usually, at home,
I boil the water

549
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,906
and then I throw
the rice in.

550
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,866
A woman just is not capable

551
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,910
of doing the things
as good as he is.

552
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,786
We'll go without
some rice for a little
while and it'll be okay.

553
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,706
GRETCHEN:
<i>And it took us a while to even</i>
<i>bring it up to each other,</i>

554
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,750
<i>but once we did,</i>
<i>it's, like, "Oh, you feel</i>

555
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,587
that way, too?" And I know that,
you know, all three of us

556
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,713
<i>are feeling that.</i>

557
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,256
All right, I
said what I said.

558
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,134
I'm totally square with
everything across the board--

559
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,094
whatever anybody thinks--

560
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,804
um, but, no, I definitely am<i> not</i>
<i>a chauvinist.</i>

561
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,149
JEFF:
<i>For the last immunity challenge</i>
<i>before the merger,</i>

562
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,651
<i>an official</i>
<i>U.S. Army obstacle course</i>

563
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,446
<i>has been constructed</i>
<i>by the Green Berets.</i>

564
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,115
Hey, Rudy, look behind you.

565
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:34,950
Oh, wow.

566
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,786
RUDY:
<i>I was surprised when I seen</i>

567
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,872
<i>the two Special Forces guys</i>
<i>come down the beach.</i>

568
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,958
At first, I thought
they were British marines,

569
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,833
but, uh, they were American.

570
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,087
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

571
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,672
I have your orders here

572
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,257
your mission statement.

573
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,050
It should answer
all the questions.

574
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,095
It's a biggie, Rudy.

575
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,554
It's an operation, man.

576
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,473
Uh-oh.

577
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,766
Snake Island
obstacle course.

578
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,684
<i>I can do the obstacle course,</i>

579
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,604
but not as fast as I used to

580
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,649
and, uh,
it's only going to be...

581
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,778
The winner's going to be as fast
as your slowest person,

582
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:16,157
so, uh, maybe I can beat
one of the girls.

583
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,326
Appreciate it.

584
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:18,743
Thank you.

585
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,840
Welcome to Pagong.

586
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,842
Thank you.

587
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,344
I have the orders
for tomorrow's challenge.

588
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,013
Read them; make sure
you understand exactly

589
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,514
what's expected
of you tomorrow.

590
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,057
I wish you all the best of luck.

591
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,851
Go in there with a good,
positive frame of mind,

592
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,060
good attitude.

593
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,895
Thank you.

594
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,523
GERVASE:
<i>We're all going to be excited,</i>
<i>hyped up.</i>

595
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,234
I want them to challenge us
and push us, you know,

596
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,736
make us work hard
for this victory,

597
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,613
'cause, I mean... we're coming
full steam ahead at them.

598
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,706
JEFF:
<i>Day 18 on the island.</i>

599
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,708
For the past few days,

600
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,501
the tribes have had their minds

601
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,879
on just one thing-- the merger.

602
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,214
Tomorrow,
the two tribes become one.

603
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,550
Nobody can predict
the impact of unification.

604
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,927
As new alliances will form,
strategies will change.

605
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,722
That makes today's
immunity challenge critical.

606
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,184
<i>If Tagi loses,</i>
<i>they enter the merger</i>

607
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,353
<i>outnumbered by Pagong</i>
<i>six to four</i>

608
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,773
<i>and could then be eliminated</i>
<i>by a Pagong voting alliance.</i>

609
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,901
We're thinking
we can do this.

610
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,778
JEFF:
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>if Pagong loses,</i>

611
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,990
<i>the tribes will merge even</i>
<i>at five members each.</i>

612
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,411
<i>Joel and Jenna will run</i>

613
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,455
<i>the first half of the course</i>
<i>for Pagong;</i>

614
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,873
<i>Sean and Kelly for Tagi.</i>

615
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,125
<i>They will meet their</i>
<i>two fellow tribe members--</i>

616
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:54,756
<i>Rich and Susan for Tagi, and</i>
<i>Gretchen and Greg for Pagong--</i>

617
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,592
<i>at an obstacle called</i>
<i>"blown bridge."</i>

618
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,095
<i>All four will negotiate</i>
<i>this obstacle</i>

619
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,347
<i>and then race</i>
<i>to the finish line,</i>

620
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,558
<i>where the tribe members who are</i>
<i>not participating in the race--</i>

621
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,102
<i>Rudy for Tagi</i>

622
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,396
<i>and Colleen and Gervase</i>
<i>for Pagong--</i>

623
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,648
<i>are waiting to cheer them on.</i>

624
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,023
Survivors ready?

625
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,736
Go!

626
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,204

Come on!

630
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,938
Come on, Joel,
pick up the pace, baby!

631
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:00,697
Come on!

632
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,041
Throw that rope
back, Jenna, throw
that rope back!

633
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:18,882
Whoo!

634
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,473
Come on, Jenna!

635
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,974
Go, go, go!

00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,399
JEFF:
<i>The blown bridge</i>

637
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,401
<i>requires them</i>
<i>to now stop and think</i>

638
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,029
<i>because this obstacle</i>
<i>involves strategy.</i>

639
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,114
We got to get up...

640
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,200
JEFF:
<i>The runners are carrying</i>
<i>the instructions</i>

641
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,534
<i>on how to proceed.</i>

642
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,703
We have to start
from here.

643
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,748
JEFF:
<i>Each tribe is given</i>
<i>four boards of various lengths.</i>

644
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:59,005
<i>The object: use the boards</i>
<i>to move all four tribe members</i>

645
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,132
<i>across the pylons</i>
<i>without touching the sand.</i>

You can only
Oh, really?s.

649
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,475
We got to...

It doesn't matter
if they're ahead of you.

651
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,018
Just take your time.

652
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,270

00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,162
Outstanding, outstanding.

689
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,163
Outstanding.

690
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,332
Outstanding.

691
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,750
Outstanding.

692
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:04,172
Sue, give me a hug.

693
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,007
Wow.

694
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,925
Suck it up, man.

695
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,969
Good job, good job.

696
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,014
JEFF:
<i>Tagi has won and must now</i>
<i>paddle out to Snake Island</i>

697
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,892
<i>to retrieve the immunity idol.</i>

698
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,685
Look for the snakes;
you'll find the idol.

699
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,354
The snakes, we'll
find the idol.

700
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,605
Yes.

701
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,159
All right,
who did it?

702
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,244
Who did it?

703
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,247
Who counted that chicken
before it hatched?

704
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,041
Who counted the chickens?

705
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,253
JOEL:
<i>The thing is, we're coming back</i>
<i>after the challenge, you know--</i>

706
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,212
I'm sore, you know-- we lost.

707
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,090
Tired, beat up--
coming back here thinking,

708
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,759
"All right, we're going
to have some chicken."

709
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,720
Um... coming up the trail

710
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,388
<i>and what do I see?</i>

711
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,015
<i>I come around the box...</i>

712
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,101
<i>and that little one</i>
<i>was still there.</i>

713
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,185
Had his head
stuck in the side of the box.

714
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,271
Just pulling.
And I yelled and he took off.

715
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,606
(<i> hissing</i> )

716
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,568
<i>The monitor got</i>
<i>the biggest meal of the day.</i>

717
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,737
<i>I mean, that monitor</i>
<i>ate twice as much at one meal</i>

718
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,113
<i>than I've eaten since</i>
<i>I've been on this island, man.</i>

719
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,741
Totally ate my chicken.

720
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,785
They are vicious, vicious,
vicious animals.

721
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,747
I mean, they look so docile
in the wild.

722
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,290
And we're not
throwing it away.

723
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,167
That's... half the
chicken's there.

724
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,918
I guess.

725
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:06,419
And it's fresh.

726
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,755
Poor, poor dinner.

727
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,548
Don't be sad.

728
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,092
It's all right,
though, guys.
It's okay.

729
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,136
GRETCHEN:
<i>You boil it long enough,</i>
<i>you can eat anything,</i>

730
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,097
and it's already
been tenderized...

731
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,975
and gutted and decapitated,

732
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,602
so half the work is done.

733
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,945
I don't like going
to Tribal Council.

734
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,156
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Hmm... really!

735
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,783
Really.

736
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,534
GRETCHEN:
<i>The Tribal Council</i>

737
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,286
<i>is a necessary</i>
<i>part of the game.</i>

738
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,162
But it's the nasty part
of the game.

739
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,831
It's the part
that I enjoy the least

740
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,208
and that I could do without.

741
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,837
<i>I don't know who's going to go.</i>

742
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,589
<i>Could be anybody.</i>

743
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,342
JOEL:
<i>I've seen how Jenna acted</i>

744
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,845
<i>the last couple times when</i>
<i>she voted against somebody.</i>

745
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,806
<i>She really didn't</i>
<i>want to look at them</i>

746
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,224
<i>or talk to them--</i>
<i>she showed guilt</i>

747
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,351
and she hasn't...
she's really been avoiding me

748
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,853
the last couple days.

749
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,190
JENNA:
<i>I know who my vote is,</i>
<i>and it... it would be Joel,</i>

750
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,692
but, uh, I can't speak
for the rest of the tribe.

751
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,153
I got a vote last time,
so maybe I'll be off.

752
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:14,821
I don't know.

753
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,364
There's all
three aces.

754
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,366
COLLEEN:
<i>Gervase-- he's just</i>
<i>as chauvinistic</i>

755
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,952
as Joel is, God!

756
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,286
He just hides it better.

757
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,830
Oh, are you done?

758
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,915
Not yet.

759
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,209
COLLEEN:
<i>I want to vote for him</i>
<i>at the next Tribal Council</i>

760
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,752
<i>because he voted for me,</i>

761
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,045
and I'm starting
to just have, like

762
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,713
these little conflicts with him.

763
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,090
(<i> all groaning</i> )

764
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,926
GERVASE:
Oh, my God!

765
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,679
COLLEEN:
<i>This game is much too vicious</i>
<i>for my blood.</i>

766
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,897
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

767
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,608
I'm going to be back home and
be, like, "God, that's so easy."

768
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,068
GERVASE:
I feel like,
when we go,

769
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,403
to Tribal Council
and boot one person off,

770
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,364
feels like this is the end
of our<i> Survivor</i> run here

771
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,701
and we're all about
to go back to our lives

772
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,578
and I won't
talk to these guys...

773
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,913
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

774
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,375
Looks like we're going
to get rained on...

775
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,545
or them.

776
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,047
I think this stuff's
going to pass by us.

777
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,565
(<i> whooping</i> )

778
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,784
(<i> thunderclap</i> )

779
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,309
Okay.

780
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,769
Another night of reckoning
at Tribal Council.

781
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,479
So tonight's agenda

782
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,480
is the same as always
at Tribal Council.

783
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,816
You guys will have to
vote off one member.

784
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,693
So, before we
get to that--

785
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,987
Joel, were you surprised
to lose today?

786
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,073
You know...

787
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,658
I don't know
if we were really surprised.

788
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,700
I mean, I knew that

789
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,620
we were physically
stronger and faster.

790
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,997
But we pushed it
as hard as we could today

791
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,875
and, uh, came up
a little bit short this time.

792
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,169
It's no big secret
about the, uh...

793
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:37,296
comments that were made

794
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,341
regarding women
in comparison to an animal.

795
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,093
(<i> laughing</i> )

796
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,178
God, those cows!

797
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,471
What was your take on that,
Gretchen?

798
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,348
It's being made light of here,
but it... from what I gathered,

799
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,475
it wasn't necessarily
taken all that lightly.

800
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:53,020
Um, I wasn't there
for the initial conversation.

801
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,564
They were storytelling
at night, I think,

802
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,150
and I don't really believe
that Gervase--

803
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,694
oh, were we not supposed
to say who...?

804
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,364
(<i> all laughing</i> )

805
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,407
Come on!

806
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,908
What do you
mean, "Come on"?

807
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,535
You didn't say it?

808
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,704
You know,
Jeff...

809
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,414
I do not even recall
saying these words and...

810
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,416
(<i> women groaning</i> )

811
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,834
Oh, my God!

812
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,335
I mean...

813
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,004
And you know what?
You know what, Gervase?

814
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,547
Right now is when
they're going to play you

815
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,715
saying the words.

816
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,341
(<i> laughing</i> )

817
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,843
It sounds so much
like Joel, though.

818
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,470
When I listen to it,
it sounds<i> so much</i> like Joel.

819
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,597
"Don't let me offend
you or anything, but...

820
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,433
but women are the
stupidest things
on Earth..."

821
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,893
So, to clear it up

822
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,395
from your guys' take
on it, Jenna,

823
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,604
who... did you link Joel in

824
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,440
that group, also?

825
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,941
JOEL:
I got linked
into this somehow.

826
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,234
Well, uh,
it was this thing:

827
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,569
(<i> hearty laughter</i> ):
"Yeah!"

828
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,904
It kind of linked him.
I don't know.

829
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,906
That's all right.

830
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,575
Whatever.

831
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,702
Gervase, last
time I asked you
if you felt...

832
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,494
if anybody here
felt invincible,

833
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,039
you were the first
one to pipe up.

834
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,582
You said, "I'm not
going anywhere."

835
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,250
You still feel
that way tonight?

836
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,630
I refuse to answer that question
on the grounds...

837
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,382
(<i> all laughing</i> )

838
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,760
...that my invincibility
may be affected by that.

839
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,428
(<i> all laughing</i> )

840
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,013
So that's a "yes."

841
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,101
Yes!

842
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,853
I'm feeling
real good tonight.

843
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,313
Why?

844
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,482
Just because, man, I...

845
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,567
I don't know what it is.

846
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,360
I mean,
it might just be me, but...

847
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,488
I'm feeling good.

848
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,073
JEFF:
Anybody here
want to own up

849
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,783
to feeling
a little...

850
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,118
uncertain about
their future

851
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,578
in the next five
to ten minutes?

852
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,632
It's time to vote.

853
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,675
Joel.

854
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,740
I just, uh, had to vote.

855
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,175
I picked Joel for two reasons,
both small ones.

856
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,177
<i>He seems a bit</i>
<i>condescending to women</i>

857
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,179
<i>and it makes</i>
<i>it difficult to work with</i>

858
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,557
and, two-- he seems to have
the most money of anybody, so...

859
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,684
I think he needs to win less.

860
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,696
There's no good reason why,

861
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,866
<i>but it's got to be</i>
<i>for somebody, and, uh...</i>

862
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,535
that's who I'm going with
for now.

863
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,001
It's time

864
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,170
<i>and he's a little</i>
<i>too condescending</i>

865
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,880
<i>towards us ladies.</i>

866
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,715
Moo.

867
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,843
I'm just a step above a cow.

868
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,347
On the island,
fire represents life.

869
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,807
Here at Tribal Council,

870
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,058
your torches
represent

871
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,560
your life,
your identity.

872
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,936
Directly across
from you

873
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,938
are the five torches

874
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,816
from the first
five people voted off.

875
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,026
Tonight, one of
your torches

876
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,402
will be added
to that group.

877
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:28,652
I'll go tally
the votes.

878
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:42,791
Let's read
the votes.

879
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,716
First vote:

880
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,969
"Joel."

881
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,268
"Jenna."

882
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,687
"Joel."

883
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:11,820
"Jenna."

884
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:15,658
Two votes for Joel,
two votes for Jenna.

885
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,248
"Joel."

886
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,792
Last vote.

887
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:29,755
"Joel."

888
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,357
The tribe
has spoken.

889
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:54,655
It's time for
you to go.

890
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,991
Good-bye.

891
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,836
To the rest of you guys:

892
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,380
whole new ball game tomorrow.

893
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,340
Two tribes will merge into one.

894
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,800
You can head back
to your camp.

895
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:15,801
We'll talk
tomorrow.

896
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,386
Good night.

897
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,206
JEFF:
<i>Next week on</i> Survivor:

898
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,833
<i>The two tribes</i>
<i>merge into one.</i>

899
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,210
RICHARD:
<i>I think it'll be interesting.</i>

900
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,755
<i>I think it'll set up</i>
<i>a whole nother set</i>

901
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,673
of interpersonal dynamics.

902
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,592
JENNA:
<i>This group will work out</i>
<i>so well.</i>

903
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,219
GREG:
<i>This new group is like...</i>

904
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,346
it's like a banquet!

905
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,139
RUDY:
<i>It's a pain in the ass.</i>

906
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,600
If you want to win this money,
you got to get dirty.

907
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,940
I wish I could've made it
a little longer.

908
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,026
<i>I think maybe</i>
<i>the girls on the team</i>

909
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,070
<i>maybe had a little</i>
<i>inferiority complex</i>

910
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,572
<i>that they took some</i>
<i>of these remarks wrong.</i>

911
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:20,032
<i>They think</i>
<i>I'm a chauvinist.</i>

912
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,241
<i>I am definitely not.</i>

913
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,035
<i>I mean, so, that</i>
<i>is my main regret--</i>

914
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,703
<i>that I'm going</i>
<i>to leave here</i>

915
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,746
and I got, you know,
four people

916
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,624
that think
I'm a chauvinist.
