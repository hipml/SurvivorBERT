1
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:15,783
<i>Tribal</i>

2
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:18,507
could not have gone better
for me, in my...

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,472
in my opinion.

4
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:22,852
This may be dumb.

5
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:24,507
<i>I wanted the idol flushed.</i>

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,024
You are playing this
for yourself.

7
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,403
I'm playing that for myself.

8
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:29,162
This is a hidden immunity idol.

9
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:30,783
<i>I wanted Brandon to stay.</i>

10
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:32,507
Maddy.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,024
That's one. That's all there is.

12
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:36,024
<i>And Maddy got voted out</i>

13
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:37,748
<i>by a single vote from Brandon.</i>

14
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:41,438
As a <i>Survivor</i> fan, congratulations

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,886
for being
the first person to nail it.

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,990
<i>We had two Shots in the Dark--
myself and Jaime.</i>

17
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:49,403
I was in survival mode,

18
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,852
and that's why
I played the Shot in the Dark.

19
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:54,058
<i>But in reality,
I knew I was safe,</i>

20
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:56,576
and I didn't want
any of the heat on me.

21
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:59,265
<i>So I played my Shot in the Dark,</i>

22
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,024
<i>really as more
of a play of strategy</i>

23
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,507
<i>so that I didn't have to vote,</i>

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,748
<i>which means that
no one knew where my lines were.</i>

25
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:08,886
I have my extra vote
right there in my bag

26
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,576
if y'all want
to dig through it and find it.

27
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:14,645
<i>At Tribal, I banked by vote,</i>

28
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:16,921
and this is my extra vote.

29
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:19,576
So I'm gonna be able to use this
to my advantage.

30
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,679
<i>This gives me a ton of power--</i>

31
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:24,403
<i>more power than
anybody else has, at this point,</i>

32
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:26,817
<i>'cause Brandon used idol,
so it's gone. [chuckles]</i>

33
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,679
So I'm the powerful one now.

34
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,300
And obviously,
only one person here voted.

35
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:33,576
- Yeah.
- And that was you.

36
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,610
Yeah. That was just, like,

37
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:37,196
the last
majority consensus I heard.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,852
So it wasn't anything personal.

39
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:40,817
I thought that that's
where the vote was going.

40
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:43,955
<i>Tonight's Tribal
was an absolute barn burner.</i>

41
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:46,783
It went about
as poorly as it could

42
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:48,196
possibly have gone for me.

43
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,886
So, I was in survival mode,

44
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,817
and that's what
I thought was going on.

45
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:54,024
<i>There was majority consensus
that Brandon would go home,</i>

46
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:55,955
but what it looks like
is I'm the only guy left here

47
00:01:56,058 --> 00:01:57,576
that actually voted against him.

48
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:59,610
It was shocking.
I'm not gonna lie.

49
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:02,024
I thought...
I genuinely thought that I was

50
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:03,783
turning that idol in
for no reason.

51
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,714
<i>The question
really is whether I can</i>

52
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,334
repair my relationship
with Brandon.

53
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,403
If I can do that, I think
I'm sitting pretty again.

54
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:11,748
I just wanted a couple answers,
that's all.

55
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:13,541
So, no, I feel like I got 'em.

56
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,645
<i>I'm happy
'cause I'm still here,</i>

57
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:18,817
<i>but I was
very surprised by Kane.</i>

58
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,679
The fact that, you know,
he put the second vote on me

59
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:22,921
is kind of, you know,
eye-opening.

60
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:26,231
I get it. This is
the game we all signed up for.

61
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:29,024
But, I mean, it's cool.

62
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:31,541
<i>I'm trying to act cool, calm
and collected back at camp.</i>

63
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:32,783
I'm good.

64
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,472
<i>I don't want to portray</i>

65
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:36,783
that I'm mad or upset
or anything like that,

66
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:39,507
when in reality, like, yeah,
I'm... I take that to heart.

67
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,093
<i>I don't trust Kane at all.</i>

68
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:00,610
<i>I just want, like, a little pup.</i>

69
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,645
And I want it to have, like,
all pink stuff, and, like...

70
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:05,438
Even if it's a boy dog,
and just be the cutest thing.

71
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,576
Uh...

72
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,058
Why? You have a dog?
What kind of dog is it?

73
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:11,679
It's a
Maltese-cairn terrier mix.

74
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:12,990
- Oh, that's very cute.
- Oh, I love Maltese.

75
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,541
Yeah, so like Toto
from <i>Wizard of Oz.</i>

76
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:15,817
Aw...

77
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:17,162
And she's your personal dog?

78
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,610
- Whatever.
- So who kept it?

79
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:22,921
Aw...

80
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:23,921
Was it mutual?

81
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:26,921
Um, it was sort of.

82
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,541
She broke up with me.

83
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,369
Oh, that's hard. I'm sorry.

84
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:32,127
<i>Coming into this game,</i>

85
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,817
<i>I was in
a very vulnerable state.</i>

86
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:38,679
I recently
got out of a relationship

87
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,714
that meant the world
to me, and...

88
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:46,024
...I wanted to be able
to put that behind,

89
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,162
<i>but you bring it in to the game.</i>

90
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:50,714
<i>And then kicking things off
on the journey,</i>

91
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:52,162
<i>I lost my vote</i>

92
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,783
for the next
two Tribal Councils.

93
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:56,231
Like, I don't think this game

94
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,024
could have gone
any worse for me.

95
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:03,300
<i>Even though the Matt stock
is at an all-time low</i>

96
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:04,955
<i>in this game, I found</i>

97
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:07,024
<i>an incredible connection
with Frannie.</i>

98
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:08,300
<i>I really like Frannie.</i>

99
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:10,576
<i>I really,
really like Frannie.</i>

100
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,748
Wah.

101
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,886
Oh, yeah!
That went right into my hand.

102
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,886
Yes.

103
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,127
It feels more like fishing.

104
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,714
- Now, I'm changing the metaphor,
- Yeah.

105
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:22,403
but you're a little fishy,
and I've got my big long rod.

106
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,127
I don't usually make a habit

107
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,610
of talking about
my big long rod, but...

108
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:30,748
<i>She is really cute.</i>

109
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:33,024
She's got a really funny laugh.

110
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:38,507
The snorts--
I actually just... it...

111
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,472
you know, makes my heart gush.

112
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,231
I'm so glad that you're here.

113
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:43,576
Me too.

114
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:45,162
<i>I would 100%</i>

115
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:47,990
ask Frannie out,
and I think she likes me, too.

116
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:51,300
<i>And we trust
each other completely.</i>

117
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:55,196
Uh...

118
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:03,576
Which is, like, really bad.

119
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,679
<i>I love Matt.</i>

120
00:05:04,783 --> 00:05:05,921
<i>He's so much fun to have around.</i>

121
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:07,438
<i>And the fact that</i>

122
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,886
Matt trusts me, and that

123
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,196
I'm the only person
who he's telling about this

124
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,438
is a really good sign.

125
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:16,369
<i>But I'm worried that
other people on the tribes</i>

126
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:18,541
<i>might see Matt and I as a pair.</i>

127
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,472
- Do you think?
- I don't know.

128
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:25,886
Heidi.

129
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,541
Here's the thing...

130
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,058
- It's only been four days. Yeah.
- Stop freaking me out.

131
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,231
<i>The thought of distancing
myself from Matt</i>

132
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:32,990
<i>is a little upsetting.</i>

133
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:34,748
That's so hard
'cause I want to keep,

134
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,852
like, talking to you,
but I feel like we should

135
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:39,472
- try to not talk, the two of us,
the rest of the day.
- Yeah, no, I agree.

136
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:41,024
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

137
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,610
I will say, I feel like
Matt goes where you go, so...

138
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:44,058
So, I told him
that he and I should

139
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:45,990
probably spend less time
together the rest of today.

140
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:49,783
<i>It's so hard,</i>

141
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,507
<i>because Matt and I</i>

142
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,955
<i>just can't stop talking.</i>

143
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:55,541
I think we just
gravitate towards each other.

144
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,921
We're just, like,
two big, dorky magnets

145
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,403
that can't be pulled apart.

146
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,058
Oh, me, too.
Me, too. Like Ernest.

147
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:07,334
Are you serious?
Like, what are they doing?

148
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:10,196
<i>It's just digging their holes
deeper. This could be</i>

149
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,783
a real liability for Frannie,

150
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:12,921
being so close to Matt.

151
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,334
Ooh!

152
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:33,162
- I know.
- Yeah. What else?

153
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:35,231
Wait, what am I doing?
I'm, like...

154
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:36,817
Some clean material.

155
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:39,403
<i>As much as we're
trying to gel as a tribe</i>

156
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:40,714
<i>and, you know,
bond with each other,</i>

157
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,679
<i>I think there's
some underlying tension</i>

158
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:45,472
that we haven't
really talked about.

159
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:49,560
<i>That birdcage is kind of just</i>

160
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:51,733
in the back of everyone's mind.

161
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:55,215
<i>We all think there's
an advantage or an idol</i>

162
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,664
<i>or something in there.</i>

163
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,112
I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it anymore.

164
00:06:58,215 --> 00:06:59,871
Let's just talk about the key.

165
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,491
We want to find the key.

166
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:02,905
Let's go get the key.
I'm bored.

167
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:04,388
Like, I for real
just want to have fun.

168
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,250
Let's get the key.

169
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:10,112
<i>You try to be coy, but
I was a little nervous about it,</i>

170
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:11,733
because, you know, there are
people that you're working with

171
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:13,595
<i>and then</i>

172
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:16,008
that means that there are people
that you're not working with.

173
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,181
<i>So a group hunt means</i>

174
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:21,043
it's a free-for-all.
What happens if it ends up

175
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:23,422
in the hands of someone
you're not working with?

176
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,008
Okay, let's do it. Let's go.

177
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,284
I'll take the tree.
You guys go somewhere else.

178
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,491
Please, Yam Yam.

179
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:38,146
Don't try that ...

180
00:07:40,802 --> 00:07:42,664
<i>Oh, my God. That birdcage</i>

181
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:44,560
is driving me crazy.

182
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,077
<i>What it is, I don't know yet,</i>

183
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:48,491
but I'm gonna get it.

184
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:53,905
<i>I need to get this key because</i>

185
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,905
I don't feel like
I click well with them.

186
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,457
I don't.

187
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,836
<i>And so, I didn't just, like,
go on the ground.</i>

188
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
I start digging.

189
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:06,284
<i>And I was climbing.</i>

190
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,215
<i>Honestly, like, that
was just a dream in itself.</i>

191
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,353
Like, I'm on <i>Survivor</i>
climbing a tree.

192
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:15,112
<i>Like, you know how many times
I've thought about that?</i>

193
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,974
<i>So it was amazing, but as
I'm digging, I feel something.</i>

194
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,008
Oh... Oh, my God.

195
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,560
- You need help?
- There's a snake in the tree.

196
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,146
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

197
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,008
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, we need, we need help.

198
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:35,733
Yeah, it's not...

199
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,491
<i>After the last Tribal Council,</i>

200
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:46,319
I'm worried because
I am the only person

201
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:49,422
who voted against Brandon
that's still in this game.

202
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:51,698
<i>So we know that
the idol got flushed</i>

203
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:55,284
<i>and we know that, historically,
that means idols come back in.</i>

204
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:56,733
So I'm going out there,
I'm doing my rounds,

205
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,043
picking up a little firewood,

206
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,871
<i>but I'm looking for it,
just to see.</i>

207
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,767
<i>You never know in this game.</i>

208
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,974
He's been taking
a lot of walks by himself.

209
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:12,215
Yeah.

210
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,664
Well, then, I mean, if he's
looking, then I want to look.

211
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,526
- I'm just gonna
be honest about it.
- Yeah.

212
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,836
<i>Since Brandon played the idol,</i>

213
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,767
<i>there's another idol
to be found,</i>

214
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,146
<i>and Kane is definitely looking</i>

215
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,422
for the idol the most.

216
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,629
Ooh!

217
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:30,767
Matthew!

218
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,353
- Yeah?!
- I got a crab.

219
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:34,457
Oh!

220
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:37,284
Let's see.

221
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:38,974
- Where is it?
- It's in here.

222
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,422
- In there?
- Yeah.

223
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,802
Oh, yeah. It's a big guy.

224
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:45,733
Incredible.

225
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,871
Good job.

226
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:54,767
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

227
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:01,526
<i>I'm always doing something.</i>

228
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,043
<i>And when I'm doing something,
I'm also</i>

229
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,250
doing something else. And that
something else is looking

230
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:07,008
<i>for advantages and idols.</i>

231
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:08,940
You know "phone, wallet, keys"?
I'm going "bamboo,

232
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,905
<i>palm leaves, idols"</i>

233
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:12,250
<i>every time I leave the house.</i>

234
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:13,905
Right now,
the house is a shelter.

235
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,457
Is he just looking
for bamboo maybe?

236
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
<i>I let him run himself down,</i>

237
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:21,905
<i>but I feel like
maybe I shouldn't.</i>

238
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:23,526
<i>We do not have
to keep up with him.</i>

239
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:24,733
<i>There's no way in hell</i>

240
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:25,871
any of us are gonna
be able to, like,

241
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:27,905
go, go, go, go, go, like that.

242
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:30,146
- So don't feel, like...
Really, let's take breaks.
- Yeah.

243
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:36,905
I'm the chief laziness czar.

244
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:39,491
-"Stop that! Lie down!"
-"Be more lazy."

245
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:43,043
<i>I don't know the best way
to find an idol,</i>

246
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,871
but I know the worst way,
and that's not looking.

247
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:46,181
And I am not doing that.

248
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:54,181
All right, let's go, dude.

249
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:56,802
Where's, um, Danny?

250
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:58,181
Oh, I guess palm fronds.

251
00:10:59,802 --> 00:11:01,974
<i>It's the key to that birdcage,</i>

252
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,629
and I'm really excited to
find out what's inside of it.

253
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:06,146
I can't wait to tell everyone.

254
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,698
Oh, wait. No, I'm not.

255
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:09,974
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

256
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:11,560
<i>I thought about this moment</i>

257
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:14,112
in <i>Survivor,</i> for many, many
years, many, many times.

258
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,146
<i>And let me tell
anyone who wants to listen,</i>

259
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,388
it's just as good
as you think it feels.

260
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:34,663
<i>Okay, I'm gonna go, Carolyn.</i>

261
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:37,801
- Is it big?
- It's right up there.

262
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:40,283
Aah! Oh, my God. Okay.

263
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:42,283
So I went like this,
and I was clearing stuff.

264
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:43,318
Yeah.

265
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:44,697
<i>People got</i>

266
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,904
scared off by that snake,

267
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,801
<i>and I just keep telling myself,
like, "Don't give up.</i>

268
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:52,352
<i>"I can do this.</i>

269
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:54,007
<i>I got this."</i>

270
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,352
<i>And it reminded me
exactly of the time</i>

271
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:59,628
<i>where my son
swallowed his tooth.</i>

272
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:04,111
So I dug through
his poop for three days

273
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:06,352
until I found that tooth.

274
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:07,766
But I was persistent.

275
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,870
<i>I made sure that</i>

276
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,214
<i>I was gonna get that tooth.
I said,</i>

277
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:15,387
like, "I am not letting my son

278
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,145
not have a tooth under
his pillow for the tooth fairy."

279
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:21,042
<i>And I know that, like,
I'm gonna do anything</i>

280
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:23,214
to get this key.
I'm getting this key.

281
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:41,076
<i>Before I came out here,
that's what my son told me.</i>

282
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,456
<i>He's like,
"Mom, don't be too silly,</i>

283
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,456
<i>don't get voted out,
and find something like this."</i>

284
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,904
Oh, my God.

285
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,283
Yeah, I'm keeping
this to myself.

286
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:55,214
Like, I'm not telling anybody.
There's no way.

287
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,801
Oh, I just
got to compose myself. Okay.

288
00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:59,732
It was the snake.
The snake got me, like...

289
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:01,249
Any luck, Carolyn?

290
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,387
No. I'm just, like...

291
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,594
- There wasn't nothing, nothing,
nothing over there? Nothing?
- Snakes.

292
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,180
- Nothing?
- Snakes.

293
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:13,594
<i>I haven't even
looked at the birdcage</i>

294
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:15,559
<i>in the past two days. I don't
even know if it's still there.</i>

295
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:17,283
<i>- Yeah.
- I think
the scariest part</i>

296
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:19,870
- is gonna be opening the cage.
- Yeah, exactly.

297
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,007
<i>I come up on this birdcage,</i>

298
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:26,214
I'm incredibly nervous.

299
00:13:26,318 --> 00:13:27,421
I'm like,
"Did I pick the right time?"

300
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,421
<i>And yeah, constant fear.
I had that feeling</i>

301
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:32,283
<i>of looking over my shoulder,
uh, somebody's gonna roll up,</i>

302
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:34,938
<i>and it would ruin everything. But...</i>

303
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,801
scared money don't make

304
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:38,697
<i>no money.</i>

305
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:45,490
<i>This is an old-school hidden</i>

306
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:48,387
immunity idol
found in a new-school way.

307
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,490
<i>It's great,
and it doesn't end there.</i>

308
00:13:51,594 --> 00:13:54,421
This little cool amulet.
It's a coin.

309
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:56,525
"You have also found
a silver coin

310
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,938
"that has absolutely no power.

311
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,628
What you do with it
is totally up to you."

312
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:02,973
Do you want to check
the birdcage real quick?

313
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,076
Yeah. Let's go...

314
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:10,835
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

315
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:12,456
<i>Yeah.</i>

316
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,249
- Hmm. Looks the same.
- Looks the same.

317
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:20,352
Okay.

318
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:22,283
Yeah.

319
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:27,904
<i>But for real,</i>

320
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,559
- none of you guys
found anything?
- For real.

321
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:31,559
I thought that we would
have found something.

322
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:43,007
I'm surprised that none of us
found it. We looked everywhere.

323
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:44,352
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

324
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,421
Unless someone's
being sneaky, sneaky.

325
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,042
No, for real.

326
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:50,076
<i>I'm gonna have
to be sneaky with this.</i>

327
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,042
<i>But it's hard.
It's very, very, very</i>

328
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:54,421
hard for me. And a-again,
I don't-- This is the game

329
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,973
where, like, deception,
and, like...

330
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,421
<i>So I have to be better
at, like, playing</i> Survivor.

331
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,249
All right, water well?

332
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:04,249
Let's do this thing.

333
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:10,525
Am I terrified to go
to that cage and...

334
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:11,663
Yes, I am.

335
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,283
<i>I was questioning myself.</i>

336
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:15,145
<i>"Should I do it now?
Should I not do it now?</i>

337
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,870
<i>Should I do it?"
Like, I was</i>

338
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:18,249
battling in my head.

339
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,732
"Don't, don't, don't, don't."
"Do, do, do."

340
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:23,594
And then I just
started, like, "Do."

341
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:31,042
<i>I'm so, so scared,
but I'm on a mission.</i>

342
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:33,697
<i>I'm getting whatever
the heck is in that bag.</i>

343
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,318
<i>I was so panicked</i>

344
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:39,973
<i>that they were
gonna come back any second.</i>

345
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:42,352
<i>Finally, I reached
into that cage,</i>

346
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:45,111
<i>and I grabbed that bag,</i>

347
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:48,352
<i>and I put it in my pants,
shoved it down and I ran.</i>

348
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:57,490
<i>I felt like I couldn't breathe
because I was so overwhelmed.</i>

349
00:15:57,594 --> 00:15:58,697
<i>And then I thought...</i>

350
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,180
"Oh, my gosh!"

351
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:04,628
Oh, my God.

352
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,042
<i>The cage is open.</i>

353
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:09,421
And I'm the only one
who's been away from them.

354
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,076
<i>And it's gone.</i>

355
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,076
<i>It's a tribe of five,
and I'm the only one who...</i>

356
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,352
No.

357
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,594
<i>I need to get this bag back.</i>

358
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:22,973
<i>And I ran back,
and I can hear them coming.</i>

359
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:25,318
<i>I can hear them coming.</i>

360
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:28,697
I know.

361
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,663
<i>And I, like, am shaking.</i>

362
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:35,007
<i>And I put that bag back,
I took that lock...</i>

363
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:41,249
<i>...and I got away.
And now I have an idol.</i>

364
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:43,387
This is
the hidden immunity idol.

365
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:48,007
And these are just
some beads of nothing,

366
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:49,421
and they have no power.

367
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,352
<i>So I don't know
what I'm gonna do with it,</i>

368
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:53,318
<i>but it makes me happy.</i>

369
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:57,387
But, like, look,
I mean, like, that is open.

370
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,525
<i>Like, that was not
open like that, right?</i>

371
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,283
It's even not heavy...

372
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:03,456
It was, yeah.

373
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,042
- You see how, like, the...
- Yeah.

374
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:06,456
If-if there
was something in there,

375
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,214
it would be weighted down.

376
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,421
Someone's gotten it.

377
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:10,732
I don't know.
Now I'm getting nervous.

378
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:12,387
Yeah.

379
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,559
<i>The little pouch
that's in the birdcage</i>

380
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:16,663
<i>looks like the drawstrings
have been opened.</i>

381
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,766
Did someone get the advantage
and then hang up the bag,

382
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,663
lock the lock, and, you know,

383
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,111
it looks like
nothing's been touched?

384
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:24,559
I think the key's been gotten.

385
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:25,766
- I think so, too.
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,180
<i>It's been messed with.</i>

387
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:29,352
And right then and there,
I'm like,

388
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:30,697
"This is the time that someone's

389
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,732
gonna be
trying to be deceptive."

390
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:33,973
But I don't know
if it's one of us.

391
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:38,559
<i>I know about body language
and deceptive behaviors</i>

392
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:42,007
from all the books I read about,
like FBI interrogation

393
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,559
and-and knowing, like, how to
figure out if someone's lying

394
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,525
<i>and reading body language.</i>

395
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:49,559
<i>So I instantly
start analyzing the people.</i>

396
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,111
I don't have it.
Like, I'm going crazy.

397
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:54,628
<i>Sarah looks concerned
that someone</i>

398
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:56,318
<i>has something
that she doesn't have.</i>

399
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:57,732
<i>Yam Yam looks distraught.</i>

400
00:17:57,835 --> 00:17:59,421
He has been
looking for this forever.

401
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,111
You can go look at her bag.

402
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:07,111
You could do my bag search.
Like, I'm not kidding.

403
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,145
Okay.

404
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:12,283
<i>And then Helen,</i>

405
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:13,628
arms crossed,

406
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:15,283
<i>holding her body posture
a little bit,</i>

407
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:17,214
<i>and that tells me she's
not telling the truth</i>

408
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:19,421
<i>about something.
I don't know if she has the key,</i>

409
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,663
but I know she knows
something that I don't.

410
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:24,456
- Everybody take their stuff out.
- Yeah.

411
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,180
<i>So we all go back
to camp, the four of us, and</i>

412
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:29,352
we all get our bags
to go through them.

413
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,283
- Mud dress.
- My bra.

414
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:33,076
- My pants.
- Belt.

415
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,938
- Nothing else. Yeah.
- There's nothing else.

416
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,766
<i>When everybody starts showing
that they have nothing</i>

417
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,663
<i>in their bag, what I'm
looking for is nervousness.</i>

418
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:42,801
<i>And I saw, like,
a nervousness from Sarah.</i>

419
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,697
- Sand.
<i>- She started breathing</i>

420
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:46,283
a little hard. She was,

421
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:48,732
<i>like, touching her chest.
Like, if I had boobs,</i>

422
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,697
<i>I would put the idol
in my boobs, you know?</i>

423
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,663
- I think she has it.
<i>- My biggest</i>

424
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,249
suspect is Jam. Jam.

425
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:57,628
<i>He was looking the most,
wanted it the most.</i>

426
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:59,732
<i>He's sneaky.</i>

427
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:02,387
Carolyn is gonna freak out
when she finds out

428
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,732
that someone has it.

429
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,387
Like, do you remember
it being open like that?

430
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,628
- Oh, my...
- And, like, on...

431
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,766
And look at the bottom.
Like, there's nothing in there.

432
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,801
<i>Oh! I didn't even
know how to react.</i>

433
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,180
<i>And I felt just, like...</i>

434
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,870
- It was meant to not look like
- Yeah.

435
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:20,214
someone took anything,
like someone tried

436
00:19:20,318 --> 00:19:21,490
to make it look like
there was nothing taken.

437
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,214
But it very obviously
has been taken.

438
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:26,559
<i>Yes, in an ideal world,
I would have</i>

439
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,594
put the fake thing back
in there, but no, I didn't.

440
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:31,249
And they...

441
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:32,732
they knew it was gone.

442
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:33,801
That's crazy.

443
00:19:33,904 --> 00:19:34,904
<i>I have the idol,</i>

444
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,835
<i>but I'm so scared</i>

445
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:38,214
<i>that they might think it's me.</i>

446
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:39,456
So what are people saying?

447
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,456
- Someone has to have it.
- Some... Yes.

448
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,042
<i>In my gut, I say, like, "No,</i>

449
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,042
<i>they don't think I have it."
But then I get paranoid.</i>

450
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:13,811
Come on in.

451
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:22,776
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

452
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:29,500
Tika, Soka, getting your first
look at the new Ratu tribe.

453
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,742
Maddy voted out

454
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:32,880
at the last Tribal Council.

455
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:38,535
All right, shall we get to
today's immunity challenge?

456
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:39,983
- Yeah!
- Yes!

457
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:41,811
First things first.

458
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:43,604
Heidi, I hate to...
You've got the saber

459
00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:45,190
so nicely tucked in there.

460
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:51,155
Thank you.
Thank you.

461
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:56,880
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

462
00:20:56,983 --> 00:20:58,190
For today's challenge,
you're gonna race

463
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:00,466
<i>up and over an obstacle</i>

464
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:03,604
<i>to a pile of large sandbags.</i>

465
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,569
<i>You're gonna empty the sandbags</i>

466
00:21:05,673 --> 00:21:07,845
<i>until you find a bag
containing a ball.</i>

467
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:10,604
<i>Once you have the ball,
you'll lift</i>

468
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,293
<i>a heavy ladder, climb it,</i>

469
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,742
<i>then use a rope</i>

470
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:17,569
<i>to raise a bridge.</i>

471
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:20,086
<i>Everybody will then
race across the bridge</i>

472
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,811
<i>to the finish...</i>

473
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,638
<i>...where one tribe member
must maneuver that ball</i>

474
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,224
<i>to the top of a snake maze.</i>

475
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:31,569
The first two tribes

476
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:34,948
to complete the challenge
win immunity.

477
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:36,914
That means you won't
be going home tonight.

478
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:38,776
In addition,
you're playing for reward.

479
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,052
Want to know
what you're playing for?

480
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:43,466
Something good.

481
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,638
It will change your life.

482
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:49,604
Second tribe to finish--

483
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:51,845
not as big, but it'll still
get the job done.

484
00:21:54,638 --> 00:21:56,190
Third tribe to finish--

485
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:58,190
otherwise known known
as the losers--

486
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,673
Tribal Council tonight
where somebody will be

487
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:02,328
the third person voted out

488
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:05,397
and as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint. Ratu,

489
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,673
your plan to get yours back.

490
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:08,673
All right, Soka,
you have one extra person.

491
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:10,017
Gonna sit somebody out.

492
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,397
Who's it gonna be?

493
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,431
I'll do it again.

494
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:15,190
Claire gonna sit out again.

495
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,052
Is that a volunteer
or is that a tribe decision?

496
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:19,845
- Both?
- Huh.

497
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:22,121
Okay, Claire will take a spot
on the sit-out bench.

498
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,569
Everybody else,
give you a minute a strategize,

499
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:26,052
we'll get it on!

500
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:36,017
All right, here we go.
For immunity and reward.

501
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,431
Survivors ready?

502
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:42,948
- Go!
- Go, Soka!

503
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:44,155
First, you got to
get up and over

504
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:47,431
and get to your sandbags.

505
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:49,052
That's the first phase.

506
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:51,535
Wow. Danny,
that is how you do it.

507
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,466
All right, go, go, go, go.

508
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:56,914
Come on, Yam Yam!

509
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:58,155
You're good.
You're good.

510
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:00,155
- Tika, you're good.
- Go, go!
- Go, go!

511
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,638
Go, Carson!

512
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:04,569
Gonna be Brandon for Ratu,
- Let's go!

513
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:07,742
Danny for Soka, Carson for Tika.

514
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,707
You're looking for a colored bag
with a ball in it.

515
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:12,500
You don't have it,
it's not there.

516
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,052
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Danny got it

517
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:17,880
for Soka.
Untie those knots.

518
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:19,880
Soka! Soka!

519
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,914
It is Soka,
once again, in the lead.

520
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:25,914
- All right, let's go.
- Let's throw the ladder up.

521
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:28,500
- One, two, three.
- Yeah.

522
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:30,052
Let's go, go, go, go!

523
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:31,880
Go, Heidi, go.

524
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:34,914
One person goes up.
It's gonna be Heidi.

525
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:36,604
Throw that rope down.

526
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,742
Throw that rope hard.

527
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:40,293
Okay.

528
00:23:40,397 --> 00:23:42,983
- Yes!
- Come on, Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

529
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:45,500
Tika now has their ball,
with Helen on the knot.

530
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:46,707
Nice, Helen. You got this.

531
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:48,569
- Come on, Heidi!
- I'm going!

532
00:23:48,673 --> 00:23:49,673
Brace yourself, brace yourself!

533
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,742
Heidi heads across.

534
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,604
Pull that ladder. You're good.

535
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,121
Ratu still looking
for their ball,

536
00:23:59,224 --> 00:24:00,604
with Helen on the knot for Tika.

537
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:01,914
Go, go, go, go! Go. Go.

538
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:04,914
One, two, three, go.
One, two, three, go.

539
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:06,880
Soka, once again,
in a commanding lead

540
00:24:06,983 --> 00:24:09,017
in a challenge.

541
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:10,914
It's Jaime looking
for that ball.

542
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:13,673
They've got it.
Ratu, start untying your knots.

543
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:15,535
Go! One!

544
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:17,052
- Two, three! Go!
- He got it! He got it!
He got it!

545
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,259
Gonna be Helen going across.
Whoa!

546
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:21,362
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

547
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:23,845
You're good, Tika. Let's go!

548
00:24:23,948 --> 00:24:25,224
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

549
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:27,604
Ratu has their knots undone.

550
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:29,914
- Go!
- Here comes Tika.
You're good. Slide down.

551
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:40,259
Soka's through. It's gonna be
Josh on the snake maze.

552
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:43,811
Down, down, down, down, down!

553
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:45,707
You got it! You got it! Go!
- Go. Jaime, go!

554
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:47,983
- It's Jaime across.
- You're good!

555
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,811
- You're good! You're good!
- Here comes Ratu.

556
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:54,880
Dead last,
a familiar spot for Ratu.

557
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:57,811
Lauren working the knots
for Ratu.

558
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,535
Let's go, Josh.
It's gonna be Josh

559
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:01,776
on the last phase
of this challenge.

560
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,604
Go, go, go, go, go!

561
00:25:03,707 --> 00:25:05,673
It's gonna be Sarah for Tika.

562
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:07,673
Let's go, Sarah!
Bring it home, you got this.

563
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:09,845
Lauren getting those last knots
undone for Ratu.

564
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:11,880
- Go! Go! Go!
- There you go.

565
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:13,811
- It's Matthew through!
- There you go, Matthew.

566
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:15,604
Don't rush, because
they're gonna mess up,

567
00:25:15,707 --> 00:25:17,811
- and we'll have the lead.
- It's now Matthew in it.

568
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:19,811
We've got
all three tribes in it.

569
00:25:19,914 --> 00:25:21,224
That's what you want.

570
00:25:21,328 --> 00:25:22,638
This challenge is on.

571
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:27,293
Josh dropped.
That's gonna happen.

572
00:25:27,397 --> 00:25:30,293
Definitely a learning curve
on this part of the challenge.

573
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:32,224
Takes a lot of touch.

574
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:33,673
You got to be right.

575
00:25:34,948 --> 00:25:36,569
- Sarah.
- Tiny movements.

576
00:25:36,673 --> 00:25:37,776
You got this.

577
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,466
Matthew making
fast work of this.

578
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:46,466
Matthew has almost caught Sarah
very quickly.

579
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,845
- Josh drops again.
- Hey, buddy,

580
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,948
- take a breath, reset.
- You got this.

581
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:53,638
Matthew really
figuring this out.

582
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:55,776
Yeah.

583
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,914
You're doing amazing, Sarah.

584
00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:58,362
Sarah doing a nice job.

585
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:01,086
- Sarah two thirds
of the way through.
- Yeah!

586
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,224
Matthew's at the two-third mark.

587
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,742
Easy, Matthew.

588
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:06,466
- You got this.
- Ratu would love
a victory.

589
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:09,983
And a nice save by Matthew.

590
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,155
Josh drops again.

591
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:16,121
- Oh.
- Sarah with a nice save.

592
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:17,811
Good save. Good save, Sarah.

593
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:20,155
But she can't pull it off.
- It's okay.

594
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:21,811
Sarah loses all her progress.

595
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,190
It is now Matthew
in the lead for Ratu.

596
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,293
Matthew has not dropped yet.

597
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:29,776
There you go, Matt.

598
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,259
Come on, Matthew.

599
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:34,328
Matthew inching
closer and closer.

600
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,673
Closer.

601
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:40,362
He's as close as you can get.

602
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,535
A win for Ratu!

603
00:26:42,638 --> 00:26:46,155
Ratu has it!
Ratu wins immunity!

604
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:48,259
We are looking for one more.

605
00:26:48,362 --> 00:26:51,121
It's gonna be Tika or Soka.

606
00:26:51,224 --> 00:26:52,535
Slow and steady,
slow and steady.

607
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:53,914
Sarah a little bit
behind for Tika.

608
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:55,259
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.

609
00:26:55,362 --> 00:26:57,431
- Josh with a nice save.
- You got it. Yeah!

610
00:26:57,535 --> 00:27:00,569
Sarah now hoping
for a mistake by Josh.

611
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:02,259
You've got this, Sarah.

612
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:03,845
You're good. You're good.

613
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:05,500
But Josh back on the move.
Steady hands.

614
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:07,190
Just keep going. You're fine.

615
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,776
Josh getting very close
to the win for Soka.

616
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
- You got this, Sarah.
- And Sarah

617
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:14,569
- on his tail,
- You're doing super well.

618
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:16,155
not far behind.

619
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,535
Put it safe
in that pocket, Josh.

620
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:19,742
Remember to breathe. Josh.

621
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:23,638
Will Josh drop or can he close
the deal right here for Soka?

622
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,017
- Slow, slow, slow.
- Josh so close.

623
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:28,155
Nice job, Sarah. You have this.

624
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:29,259
Two inches away.

625
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:32,155
- Can he do it?
- Take a deep breath, Josh.

626
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:40,121
- Yes!
- You got it!

627
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:43,052
Soka wins immunity,
safe from Tribal Council,

628
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:46,017
sending Tika to Tribal Council,

629
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:51,259
where somebody will be the
third person out of <i>Survivor</i> 44.

630
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,880
All right.
Ratu, congratulations.

631
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:59,466
Sword is yours.

632
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:02,811
Nobody going home from Ratu.

633
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:07,086
Josh, nice job.
Nobody going home from Soka.

634
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,293
So, I got to ask, Matthew.
You took to that very fast.

635
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,328
You put yourself in that role.

636
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:13,052
Where does
that decision come from?

637
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:15,673
Because this is
a win it or lose it spot.

638
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:17,880
I asked my tribe to trust in me,
and I went

639
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:20,535
against the doctor's orders
and took my arm out of my sling

640
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:22,293
because I knew I could do this.

641
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:23,880
I built one of these
in my backyard,

642
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:26,742
and I practiced
on this many, many times.

643
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:28,707
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

644
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:31,328
So you built a replica?

645
00:28:31,431 --> 00:28:33,569
Out of plywood, yeah.

646
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:35,535
I've been preparing
for this for a while.

647
00:28:35,638 --> 00:28:38,052
Well, it paid off. Nice job.
That is dedication.

648
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:41,086
- In addition,
you've earned back your flint.
- Yes!

649
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,845
- Bring that this way.
- Yeah.

650
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:46,466
Ratu, Soka, your fishing gear

651
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:47,983
will be waiting for you
back at camp.

652
00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:49,431
Enjoy the night off.
Nobody going home

653
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:50,983
from your tribe.
Grab your stuff. Head out.

654
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:57,811
All right, Tika,
Tribal Council tonight

655
00:28:57,914 --> 00:29:00,742
where somebody will be the third
person voted out of <i>Survivor</i> 44.

656
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:03,121
And you know what's coming
as a penalty for losing.

657
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:04,535
Sorry for you.

658
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:07,052
Take your flint.
Thanks, Sarah.

659
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:09,224
All right,
grab your stuff, head out.

660
00:29:09,328 --> 00:29:10,397
See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

661
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,190
<i>Losing today's challenge sucked.</i>

662
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,328
There was just so much like,
"We got this!" I felt so good.

663
00:29:16,431 --> 00:29:18,776
<i>And then it was, like,
crumbling down,</i>

664
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,155
<i>and I'm scared
that I might be a target</i>

665
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,604
<i>because I just haven't felt good
on this tribe.</i>

666
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:26,121
<i>So I'm having a battle</i>

667
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:29,086
<i>of whether or not
I want to play this idol.</i>

668
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:47,796
<i>Pray for everybody.</i>

669
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,796
How are we supposed to beat
a guy who has one of these built

670
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,348
- in his backyard, you know?
- Oh, my God.

671
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:53,968
- Yeah, that's ridiculous.
- That's...
- Yeah.

672
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:55,968
I mean, like,
there's really no... Yeah.

673
00:29:56,072 --> 00:29:57,900
<i>It feels terrible to lose.</i>

674
00:29:58,003 --> 00:29:59,313
It made sense
'cause Matthew had practiced,

675
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:00,762
and if you practice
these things,

676
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,486
you could probably do way better
than the average person.

677
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:05,072
<i>And I kind of relate to that</i>

678
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:07,451
<i>because to prepare
for</i> Survivor,

679
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,865
<i>I realized that so many
of the puzzles are repeated,</i>

680
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:13,658
<i>and I can use that to
my advantage, and so, I would</i>

681
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:16,175
<i>read a design and print them
on my home 3D printer.</i>

682
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,279
<i>And I practiced a ton
of past</i> Survivor <i>puzzles.</i>

683
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:22,348
<i>And nobody needs
to know that because,</i>

684
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:23,934
<i>like, that would just
put a target on me.</i>

685
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:26,106
We have until sundown.

686
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,762
I would estimate, like,
maybe three hours? I'm not sure.

687
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:33,727
<i>And I'm also studying
to be a rocket scientist.</i>

688
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,934
<i>I did do two work semesters</i>

689
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:39,348
<i>with NASA, so I have a lot
of problem-solving abilities.</i>

690
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:40,796
So I'm gonna go try to find...

691
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,520
Like, just right around here,

692
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:44,348
- I'm gonna try
to find some little sticks.
- Okay.

693
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:45,727
<i>But I don't want people to know</i>

694
00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:47,072
<i>about rocket science because</i>

695
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,624
<i>I don't want them to think</i>

696
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:50,520
<i>that I am a little bit
more intelligent than they are.</i>

697
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,831
<i>So out here,
I'm focusing on my social gut.</i>

698
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:57,796
Do I know where I'm going to go?
Not really.

699
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,727
<i>But part of my gameplay
is to make people feel</i>

700
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:02,658
<i>like I'm with them.</i>

701
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:06,693
Cease. Yeah, no, me too.

702
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:09,831
First, we can match just,
like, who we'd want to keep.

703
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,865
- Right.
- Yam Yam's strength
is really helpful, so...

704
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:13,210
<i>It's so important,</i>

705
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:14,900
<i>and that might
keep us more sustained.</i>

706
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,555
<i>Um, Carolyn is... She's, like,</i>

707
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:19,003
- hard to, like,
keeping her control.
- Yeah.

708
00:31:19,106 --> 00:31:22,762
<i>Carolyn has so much emotion,</i>

709
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,348
<i>and she's so unfiltered</i>

710
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:26,727
<i>that it's hard to sometimes,
like, work with someone</i>

711
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:29,520
who's always going to be saying
the truth about something.

712
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,141
- Yeah.
- Right.

713
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:38,486
<i>Sarah, Carson and I are really
on the same page, so,</i>

714
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:42,037
I think the plan for tonight,
if I can trust my gut,

715
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:44,865
<i>and the people that
I've surrounded myself with,</i>

716
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:46,589
<i>is to vote Carolyn out.</i>

717
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:47,762
Um... What?

718
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,003
She's out. She's...

719
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:50,658
We're all on the same page.

720
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:52,658
- Right? Okay, so...
- Yeah.

721
00:31:52,762 --> 00:31:55,003
<i>I've lost my vote for one
Tribal Council on the journey,</i>

722
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:59,555
<i>but I don't want anyone
to know I don't have a vote.</i>

723
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:03,279
<i>So, right now, there are
five people, only four votes.</i>

724
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:08,313
And I know that I need
to lock in three people with me.

725
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:11,900
<i>So, ideally,
Helen, Carson and Yam Yam</i>

726
00:32:12,003 --> 00:32:13,693
<i>all vote Carolyn.</i>

727
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:15,141
We obviously know,

728
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:16,520
like, we're together,

729
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:17,968
- so, we just got to, like...
- Yeah.

730
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,658
...because we know...

731
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:25,451
<i>So, the plan</i>

732
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:28,348
<i>that everybody's
throwing out there was Carolyn,</i>

733
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:31,072
and I went with it. I said, "Of
course we're gonna target her."

734
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,313
<i>But Carolyn and I have
a connection because</i>

735
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:38,348
<i>I really gel with her energy.</i>

736
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:41,244
Here's my plan. If we don't get
Carson in with us...

737
00:32:41,348 --> 00:32:42,831
Well, then we're screwed.

738
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:44,279
<i>Carolyn and I--</i>

739
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:47,968
we're old, crazy people,
but we're here to play.

740
00:32:48,072 --> 00:32:49,520
Who you want to vote off?

741
00:32:49,624 --> 00:32:52,210
- Anyone but me or you,
and I'm serious.
- Me too.

742
00:32:52,313 --> 00:32:53,451
So, my preference would be...

743
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,589
All right,
we're in the same person.

744
00:32:55,693 --> 00:32:57,279
Let's do a letter...
a letter with the hands

745
00:32:57,382 --> 00:32:59,003
and then put the letter up.

746
00:32:59,106 --> 00:33:00,727
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

747
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:02,900
Yeah. H.
That was my H.

748
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:04,313
<i>I want to get rid of Helen</i>

749
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:05,658
<i>because she's super intelligent.</i>

750
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:07,175
<i>She's constantly</i>

751
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,624
working scenarios out.

752
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:10,072
<i>And if we get rid of Helen,</i>

753
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:12,175
<i>and Sarah doesn't have Helen,</i>

754
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,037
the only thing Sarah has is us.

755
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:16,520
We can't... we can't get...
Like, um, I think,

756
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:18,072
like, we have to stick together.

757
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:19,831
I want to...
I want to be... Yeah.

758
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:21,520
- Like, I want to be
a part of your life. Like...
- Yeah. Oh.

759
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,589
Yup. Okay.
So, but we got to be careful.

760
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:25,900
So...

761
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,658
Here-here... here's...
Here. You...

762
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:29,727
It's okay.

763
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:32,141
<i>When Carson got to Carolyn,</i>

764
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,520
<i>she was, like,
all over the place.</i>

765
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:40,348
No, it's fine. I'll go with...

766
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,313
<i>She's like a mix
of Goofy and Cher.</i>

767
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:44,727
Oh, we're done.

768
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:46,244
- Are you kidding me?
- Okay.

769
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:48,520
What do you mean, am I gonna
change this? To what-- me?

770
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:50,003
Oh, no. We believe you. Yeah.

771
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:51,520
I am not.
I swear on everything.

772
00:33:51,624 --> 00:33:53,003
I'm the same. Everything.

773
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:54,348
<i>Carson is, like,</i>

774
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:56,279
this smart...
Like, I'm smart, too.

775
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,106
But, like, he's just, like...

776
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,313
He has it good with everybody.

777
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,589
So I'm trying
to think in my head like,

778
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:04,348
"What is the benefit for you

779
00:34:04,451 --> 00:34:07,486
to go with me and Yam Yam?"

780
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,968
- I...
- I feel like, you're way tight
with them, so I'm like,

781
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:11,417
-"Why..."
- I have to put on that facade.

782
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,727
But, like,
this is what I'm talking about.

783
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:16,072
<i>I'm scared that</i>

784
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:18,175
Carson's lying.

785
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:28,279
Like, what's in it for him?

786
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:30,486
It's... it's something
that has crossed my mind.

787
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,831
<i>So immediately, I worried, like,</i>

788
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:34,451
<i>"Is it gonna be me?"
And then I thought like,</i>

789
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,279
<i>"I have this idol.
I don't want to use it</i>

790
00:34:36,382 --> 00:34:38,658
<i>if I don't have to,
but I don't want to go home."</i>

791
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:43,141
I'm so scared.
Oh, my God.

792
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:45,141
Carolyn, you know,
is getting nervous,

793
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:47,451
- but I just talked with her.
- Mm-hmm.

794
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:49,141
- Exactly.
- So it's just
really nerve-racking.

795
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:51,279
<i>I'm really liking playing
both sides, because for me,</i>

796
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:52,934
<i>I have a lot</i>

797
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:55,624
of different elements
and layers to who I am.

798
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,072
And so, at one side,

799
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:59,141
<i>I have the calm, collected side,</i>

800
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:00,658
<i>and that's more
of Helen and Sarah.</i>

801
00:35:00,762 --> 00:35:02,106
I'm just really excited

802
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,520
that we're working together
in secret.

803
00:35:03,624 --> 00:35:05,279
- Give me a hug.
- Yes.

804
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:06,693
<i>And I also have
the chaotic, crazy side,</i>

805
00:35:06,796 --> 00:35:09,727
<i>and that's, like,
Yam Yam and Carolyn.</i>

806
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,210
Wouldn't the easy vote
for you be me?

807
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:13,279
Exactly, but have you ever seen

808
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:15,072
an easy vote happen
in <i>Survivor?</i>

809
00:35:15,175 --> 00:35:17,589
I'm just like...
That's why I'm so scared.

810
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:19,003
<i>Helen and Sarah are
voting for Carolyn,</i>

811
00:35:19,106 --> 00:35:21,865
<i>and Carolyn and Yam Yam
want to out Helen.</i>

812
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,555
<i>And so I'm kind of, like,</i>

813
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,624
split. Like, I have one
personality leaning this way

814
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,313
<i>and one personality
leaning the other way.</i>

815
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,968
<i>And so, it's kind of like
having an angel on one side,</i>

816
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:35,589
<i>a devil on the other,
and they are constantly at war.</i>

817
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:37,555
<i>Usually the angel wins,
but sometimes</i>

818
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:39,072
<i>the devil can come out.</i>

819
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:04,141
Behind each of you is a torch.
Go ahead and grab a torch,

820
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:08,003
dip it in the fire
and get flame.

821
00:36:15,313 --> 00:36:16,968
This is part of the ritual

822
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:18,968
at Tribal Council,
because in this game,

823
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,658
fire represents your life,
and when your fire is gone,

824
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:25,451
sadly, so are you.
That's gonna be the case

825
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:26,900
for one of you tonight.

826
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:28,520
So let's get into it, Yam Yam.

827
00:36:28,624 --> 00:36:30,037
What did you notice happening

828
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:32,244
when you all got back to camp
after the challenge?

829
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:35,313
Was it calm
or could you feel some tension?

830
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:37,520
There was tension, definitely.

831
00:36:37,624 --> 00:36:39,451
As soon as somebody walked
into the camp, and we're like,

832
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:40,693
"Where were you?"

833
00:36:40,796 --> 00:36:42,175
You know? Like,

834
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:44,037
- we are wearing today,
like, radars.
- Ugh!

835
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:46,313
Like...
"There's somebody coming."

836
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:48,865
"Now somebody's
walking." You know?

837
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:51,727
Helen, what do you think
is the fear

838
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:53,624
where people want to say no?

839
00:36:53,727 --> 00:36:56,555
The fear is that
if I'm talking to Sarah

840
00:36:56,658 --> 00:36:57,900
or I'm talking to Carolyn,

841
00:36:58,003 --> 00:36:59,486
I think I know what's going on.

842
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:00,831
But when they talk
behind my back,

843
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,451
they also think
they know what's going on.

844
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,831
So, what if that's the reality

845
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:06,106
and I'm just living
in my own delusion?

846
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,520
That would be called
a blindside,

847
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:08,831
and that would be <i>Survivor.</i>

848
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,520
It would be <i>Survivor,</i> Jeff.

849
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:13,555
So, Helen, one of
the big decisions you have

850
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,900
to make in the early part
of the game is

851
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:17,900
"are we going based
on tribe strength...

852
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,486
- Mm-hmm.
-"or am I gonna let my personal

853
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:22,658
alliance dictate my vote?"

854
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:24,968
I think that's at the back
of everyone's minds.

855
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:27,106
Like, when you think about it,
at the end of this Tribal,

856
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,968
we're gonna have
four tribe members.

857
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,796
If we want to make it to
the merge with enough people

858
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,968
to work with,
to actually succeed post-merge,

859
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:36,279
we need to be strong
and start winning challenges.

860
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:39,658
I think it's, like,
how you measure strength.

861
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:41,658
Being with people
that you trust--

862
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,106
I think that matters
so much in this game.

863
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,210
Carson, how do you define
tribe strength?

864
00:37:47,313 --> 00:37:49,451
Yeah, it's, like,
super concerning

865
00:37:49,555 --> 00:37:51,727
because Bruce was
our strongest tribe member.

866
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:53,417
And so, like,

867
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,555
if I just vote someone out
based off of strategy,

868
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:58,244
we might not be able
to win challenges.

869
00:37:58,348 --> 00:37:59,762
We also have
to consider alliances,

870
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:01,348
and, like,
who am I working with?

871
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:04,175
But, like, it could be just
deception, and you don't know.

872
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:06,348
And that's what's so complicated
because, like,

873
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,106
you know, you come all
into this game, and, like,

874
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,279
and everyone thinks I'm a
teenager and that I'm, like, 15.

875
00:38:11,382 --> 00:38:13,451
And so, like, for me, I know

876
00:38:13,555 --> 00:38:15,624
- Oh.
- I try my best to figure out

877
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,589
like, and-and have that filter,

878
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:19,520
but I'm not perfect at it.

879
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:22,934
Carolyn, while Carson
was talking, you exhaled,

880
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:26,624
or had this exasperated feeling.
What's going on?

881
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:30,796
I don't want to cry.

882
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,072
I'm just scared.

883
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:38,555
I mean, Carolyn is like this

884
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:41,348
all the time, in a good way.

885
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:43,141
Even, like, opening

886
00:38:43,244 --> 00:38:45,072
a green papaya
and finding out it's ripe--

887
00:38:45,175 --> 00:38:46,831
like, she gets emotional.

888
00:38:46,934 --> 00:38:48,796
You know,
and this is what makes her cool.

889
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,348
I'm just grateful.

890
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:51,762
I'm grateful that I'm here.

891
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:53,106
I'm grateful
for a papaya that's ripe.

892
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,106
So it's just...
it's those little moments

893
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,658
that... that have...

894
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:58,968
They've just meant so much,
and I've told them that.

895
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,037
You know?
Who's grateful?

896
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:04,313
So there's a little bit
of past tense in your language.

897
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:05,900
- So, you wishing, "I have..."
- No, I want to stay.

898
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:07,934
Like, I'm staying.

899
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:10,037
And what it comes down to

900
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:12,831
for me is, like, who is...
who's working with me?

901
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,520
Who's talking
about this with me?

902
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:16,520
Who's strategizing with me?

903
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:19,141
So, Yam Yam, is this

904
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:20,407
ultimately a good thing, that
"We'll lose somebody tonight,

905
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,407
but I think
we'll be a better four"?

906
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,200
Well, if they lose me,
it's their loss, not...

907
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:28,165
But it's a good thing because

908
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,303
we need to know
where this family stands.

909
00:39:30,407 --> 00:39:32,545
Are we, like,
siblings that get along

910
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:34,614
or siblings that are not gonna
talk to each other?

911
00:39:34,717 --> 00:39:36,338
Let's see what happens.

912
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:40,717
All right, it is

913
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:42,993
time to vote.
Carolyn, you're up.

914
00:39:43,096 --> 00:39:44,510
Ah.

915
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:53,614
Oh, my God. Why are there
so many pieces up here?

916
00:39:53,717 --> 00:39:56,545
Like, just put one.
Oh, my...

917
00:39:58,303 --> 00:40:00,545
This is like a horror movie
over here,

918
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,269
like a haunted house, and...

919
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,821
If anybody has an advantage

920
00:40:31,924 --> 00:40:33,062
or an idol
and you want to play it,

921
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:35,027
now would be the time to do so.

922
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:43,027
Okay.
I'll read the votes.

923
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:49,821
First vote: Carolyn.

924
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:56,717
Helen. One vote Carolyn,
one vote Helen.

925
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:04,131
Helen. Two votes Helen,
one vote Carolyn.

926
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:12,372
Third person voted out
of <i>Survivor</i> 44: Helen.

927
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:14,441
That's three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

928
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:17,890
Got me, guys.
Good luck.

929
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:21,200
Bye, Helen.

930
00:41:29,062 --> 00:41:31,476
Helen, the tribe has spoken.

931
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:35,579
Time for you to go.

932
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:37,614
Thank you.

933
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,717
Grab your torches,
head back to camp. Good night.

934
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:12,165
<i>I am up against
the darkest evil.</i>

935
00:42:13,683 --> 00:42:15,786
I want to be a hero to people.

936
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,983
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor...

937
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,283
<i>I never intended
to play an honest game.</i>

938
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:20,628
<i>Those two--
they're a huge liability.</i>

939
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:23,214
<i>I'm Peter Pan</i>

940
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:24,697
<i>running through the woods.</i>

941
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:31,766
I've dreamed of being
on this show for so long,

942
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,180
<i>and to be
the third person voted out</i>

943
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:34,870
<i>is not how
I wanted this to end.</i>

944
00:42:34,973 --> 00:42:38,628
<i>I feel like I'm second-guessing
every connection that I made,</i>

945
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:41,145
<i>but, you know, it's a game,
so I respect the move.</i>

946
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:43,628
<i>Every single person played
their part very, very well.</i>

947
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:47,283
<i>I had no idea they were
protecting their own game.</i>

948
00:42:47,387 --> 00:42:48,732
So, kudos to them.
They did a great job.
