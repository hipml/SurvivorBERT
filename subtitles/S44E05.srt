it's the high vibe tribe.

173
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:19,965
Everybody here meditates.

174
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,785
It's not me having
to teach how to meditate.

175
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:24,310
It's, like, us going deeper

176
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,931
and gaining that mindset
that we need

177
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:28,965
to work well together
as a tribe.

178
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,302
Obviously, like, somebody coming
in new, it's like, "Okay",

179
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:33,647
"she's the easy vote," which is,
like, nerve-wracking.

180
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,931
- Yeah. For sure.
- And, like, unfortunate.

181
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:38,482
But if you're looking to go
into the merge even stronger,

182
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,034
I'm really valuable.

183
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:43,034
I know everything
that's going on at Ratu, so,

184
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:44,862
it's like, "Hello."

185
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,655
I have so much more information

186
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,275
than anybody playing this game.

187
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,034
You're doing exactly
what you need

188
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,497
- to be doing right now.
- [laughs]

189
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:54,482
Um, I'm not gonna, like,
commit to anything.

190
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,103
- I'm a noodler.
- Yes.

191
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:59,827
I prefer slow deliberation.

192
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:01,551
JAIME: We are all

193
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:05,586
running a marathon right now,
and Matt is learning to crawl.

194
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,241
I am the most valuable person

195
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:09,344
that anybody could
ever interact with,

196
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:13,068
and for a player to not
jump on that is mind-blowing.

197
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:16,034
Well, I can't make sense
of what type of game Matt plays

198
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:17,655
'cause, like,
it doesn't seem very

199
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:18,965
strategically strong -Yeah.

200
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:21,448
Unless he's, like,
hiding everything.

201
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,413
I think he's just
really affable,

202
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:26,241
and...

203
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:28,724
that's, like,
his biggest strength.

204
00:08:28,827 --> 00:08:31,482
I don't think that
Jaime has quite caught on

205
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:33,758
to the fact that Matt and I
are really close.

206
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,275
And that's a good thing because

207
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:39,172
I don't want to be in a position
where somebody wants

208
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,172
to make a move against Matt,

209
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:42,895
but doesn't feel like
they can tell me.

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,172
It's good to have a friend
in the game.

211
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,172
Someone totally
honest, completely, -Yeah.

212
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,958
- Who has my back no matter what.
- Yeah. Yes.

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,310
MATT: At the end of the day,

214
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,758
Survivoris a game
about relationships.

215
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:55,448
And right now,
my blind spot is Frannie,

216
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,689
'cause I really like her a lot.
Um...

217
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:02,268
- Just to, like, take a big, deep breath.
- Let's hug.

218
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,724
- Yeah.
- All right. Ready?

219
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,965
[both exhale and inhale deeply]

220
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:07,310
MATT: And I think

221
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,413
we also...

222
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't know. [Laughs]

223
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,344
I feel like

224
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:18,000
there's a little, like, uh,

225
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:20,310
you know, a spark between us.

226
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:21,758
- Okay.
- Okay.

227
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,103
FRANNIE: I don't

228
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:25,344
nothave a crush on Matt.

229
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,379
When this game is over,

230
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:30,241
Matt and I are gonna go out
for Ethiopian food together,

231
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:32,034
and whatever happens happens.

232
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:35,068
Oh.

233
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:37,620
Matt's somebody
I would date in real life,

234
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:39,517
and if it comes to that,

235
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,413
after this game is over, then...

236
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,965
I would be pleased as punch.
[laughs]

237
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,172
[laughing]: Yeah, I know.

238
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:50,758
- Oh.
- What part of my face is red?

239
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:52,758
- The whole thing?
- It's kind of blushing.

240
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:55,103
[laughing]: No.

241
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:56,896
No!

242
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:13,827
Yeah, I'm good.

243
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:17,206
No, no, I'm fine.

244
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:22,827
But, I mean, it's a game,
so, I'm-I'm...

245
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:24,379
I'm fine. I'm still here.

246
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:27,137
YAM YAM: I'm trying
to make amends with Josh.

247
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,448
I understand why he's mad,
but, dude,

248
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:31,302
you did the same thing to me...
You lied to me.

249
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:32,586
But he's like,

250
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,529
"You're the one's wrong,
and I don't trust you,

251
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:36,758
and you're the one dishonest."

252
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:39,862
Dude, great move. Applaud.

253
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:43,379
Move on. If you don't want
to work with me, it's fine.

254
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:46,103
But what's up
with the bitch face, you know?

255
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:48,758
Well...

256
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, no. No, no, no.

257
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:52,448
I was going with the group.

258
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,413
Nothing personal.

259
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:56,758
JOSH: Yam Yam, I think,
felt like he was in a position

260
00:10:56,862 --> 00:11:00,344
of power this whole time,
and now he's not.

261
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:03,172
So, he's very somber, very sad,
walking around like

262
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:04,586
someone killed his dog,

263
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:06,448
and feeling like
he's going to be next.

264
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:13,379
JOSH: But the truth
is, I don't feel safe either

265
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:16,137
because yesterday
I played my immunity idol,

266
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:17,482
so now I'm vulnerable.

267
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:19,103
So, to make sure that.

268
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:21,440
Yam Yam and Carolyn don't get
together and try to vote me out,

269
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,896
last night, I made up a lie,

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,034
saying that I'd had another idol

271
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:29,413
that I received at Soka
from the birdcage.

272
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,631
JOSH: I showed him the
piece of paper that I received

273
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:39,655
on the journey, and then today,

274
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:43,344
I made a fake immunity idol
with some beads from tree mail

275
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:46,000
that I weaved into a bracelet.

276
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,793
That makes me...

277
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:50,172
- I do, yeah. Yeah.
- Awesome.

278
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,517
YAM YAM: So Josh is telling
me he has a second idol now.

279
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,344
He didn't show me,

280
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:58,724
but if it's true,
next Tribal Council,

281
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,344
it's either Carolyn or me.

282
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:03,862
And I know
Josh doesn't trust me, so,

283
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:06,551
next vote, it means I'm out.

284
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:09,206
It sucks, you know, because

285
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,172
Josh and I are not
that different.

286
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:14,379
Did you ever come out
to your mom?

287
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,724
- I've never come out.
- You never told her?

288
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,724
You just... It was just...
It was what it was?

289
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:22,000
I... Like, the thing is,
like, coworkers of my mom, like,

290
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:24,862
they always told her like, "Oh,
he's gay, he's gay, he's gay."

291
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:27,551
And she was like, "I'm gonna
wait for him to tell me."

292
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:29,862
And blah, blah, blah.

293
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:36,482
So I never, like,
put myself out there.

294
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:39,758
Like, it wasn't a thing
of me being afraid I was gay.

295
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:44,482
Was me... a thing of me
not finding myself attractive.

296
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:48,206
And many, many years after that,
that's when I met my husband.

297
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,682
And my husband
is my first boyfriend.

298
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:51,793
Then we got married
a year after.

299
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,000
Right.

300
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,931
Um, sophomore year of college.

301
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:03,793
I couldn't come out in high
school 'cause kids were mean.

302
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:06,206
- Yeah, it was...
- You know, I wasn't ready.

303
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,241
So I moved away from my hometown

304
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:09,965
because I knew I was different.

305
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,931
And then I was like,
"You know what?

306
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:13,440
- I can't live a lie anymore."
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,413
So I told her, and she was like,
"Are you sure?"

308
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:17,103
Said, "Yeah, Mom."

309
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,379
Like, that whole day was,
like, awkward.

310
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:20,965
She was crying all the time.

311
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,517
And the next day,
she came around.

312
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,344
She was like,
"This doesn't change anything.

313
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:26,302
Thank you for coming out.
That means so much to me."

314
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:28,413
She was good.

315
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,758
I love her.

316
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:31,034
Yam Yam and Idid bond.

317
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,509
We were talking
about how I came out

318
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,655
versus how he came out

319
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:37,034
and how that was
kind of hard for us.

320
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:39,206
So we've talked about
a lot more deeper things

321
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,758
than Carolyn and I.

322
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,241
But I have to be smart.

323
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,689
I'm in a position of power,
and I haven't decided yet

324
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,379
who I want to keep around.

325
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:49,724
But I need Yam Yam
to feel comfortable.

326
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,275
I mean, I think at this point,
I have your trust?

327
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,103
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And I think I can trust you.

328
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,172
I think so. Yeah.

329
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,751
YAM YAM: I hope
he's telling the truth

330
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:04,620
because Josh
has all the control.

331
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:07,068
So, we have a challenge
coming up.

332
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:09,068
Best case scenario, we win.

333
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:11,586
If not, I'm willing
to vote out Carolyn.

334
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:13,793

00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:02,655
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

344
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:03,751
- [all voicing assent]
- PROBST: First things first.

345
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:07,137
Got to take back the idols.

346
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,379
Thank you, Brandon.

347

♪ ♪

349
00:15:13,103 --> 00:15:17,068
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

350
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:20,206
For today's challenge,
you'll be tied together.

351
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,620
On my go, you're gonna race
through a series of obstacles

352
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:24,137
to a bucket.

353
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,827
You'll fill that bucket
with water

354
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:29,379
and make your way over
a hinged platform,

355
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:33,655
transporting the water until
you have enough to lower a gate.

356
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,379
Once you reach the finish,

357
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,655
two tribe members
will work together

358
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:39,655
to maneuver balls
through a table maze.

359
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:44,482
The first two tribes
to land all three balls

360
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:46,000
win immunity.

361
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:48,172
In addition, you are playing
for power in this game

362
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:49,724
in the form of control.

363
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:53,758
Once again,
the winning tribe will decide

364
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:55,448
which three players
go on a journey.

365
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:56,724
There is a lot at stake

366
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:57,907
- in this challenge.
- Okay.

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,862
The last tribe to finish...

368
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:01,992
Tribal Council, where somebody
will be the sixth person

369
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:03,448
voted out of Survivor44.

370
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:06,344
And as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint.

371
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:09,206
Tika, you are trying
to earn yours back today.

372
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,470
Let's get to sit-outs.
Ratu, you have two extra people.

373
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:14,034
Who's gonna sit out?
Matthew sitting out again.

374

Frannie gonna sit out for Soka.

379
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:24,383
give you a minute to strategize,

380
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:26,310
and we'll get going. Here we go.

381
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:32,310
All right, here we go.

382
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:34,206
For immunity and reward,

383
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,551
Survivors ready?

384
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,000
Go!

385
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:42,103
First, you got
to get through this obstacle.

386
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:45,551
The key is how well
you can maneuver together.

387
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:47,965
- Under the stick, under the stick.
- BOTH: Got it.

388

PROBST: That was Soka.

394
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:59,275

got to get through it.

399

- FRANNIE: There you go, Soka!

400
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,130
Now you're going
to the over-unders.

401
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,862
Over one, under the next.

402
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,896
Soka's through. Ratu is through.

404

Come on, Ratu!

405
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:22,068
PROBST: You got to go
over and under together

406
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,619
because
you are tethered together.

407
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:24,931
JOSH: You ready?

408
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:26,619

410
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:31,758

414
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,586
PROBST: Soka last to the bucket.

415
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:41,758
Once your bucket's free,
fill it with water.

416
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:43,482
Key to this part
of the challenge

417
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:45,655
- is transporting the water.
- All right, let's go.

418
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:49,689
Now you've got
to go over this hinge platform.

419
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:51,482
There goes Tika.

420
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:53,172
Ratu heading out.

421
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:55,379
Danny dips in.
Soka's heading out.

422
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:57,275
There's the transition.

423
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,586
How much water can you save?

424
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,716
MATTHEW: Oh, they're
spilling all over the place, guys.

425
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:06,034
LAUREN AND FRANNIE:
Slow and steady.

00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:09,655
Tika with a nice job.

428
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:11,310
Go back, go back, go back.

429
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:14,896
Two good buckets full of water
from Tika and Ratu.

430
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,793
There's Soka.
Danny pours the water.

431
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:22,344
Everybody did a nice job
on that first round.

432
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:25,344
Here comes Ratu. Wow.

433
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:27,586

PROBST: Matt takes a big fall,

439
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:40,379
but Danny holds on
to that water.

440
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:43,758
Yeah, you got it, you got it.
Dump any time.

441
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:45,647
[Lauren screams] - PROBST:
And that's enough for Ratu.

442
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:48,310
- They are through.
- Right here, right here!

443
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:51,551
PROBST: Is that enough for Soka?

444
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:53,862
- JAIME: Yes!
- Yes. Is it enough for Tika?

445
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:57,551
Yes! Everybody's through
with two buckets.

446
00:18:57,655 --> 00:18:59,344
[indistinct shouting]

447
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,103
We are very even right now.

448
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,620
You take it off,
you take it off.

449
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,551
- HEIDI: Go, go, go!
- It's Ratu on the maze first.

450
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:08,724
Then Soka. Tika's there.

451
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:11,482
We're about as even
as you can be in this challenge.

452
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,068
Tip the other way.

453
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:16,310

PROBST: It is Carson
and Brandon for Ratu.

456
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,206
You have immunity and power.

457
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,655
You decide
who goes on that journey.

458
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:29,724
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

459
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,137
Uh, that's a dead end.

460
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:32,482
Slow and steady.

461
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:36,275
Nice job by Soka,
making a lot of progress.

462
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,103
Tika drops.

463
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:40,103
That's okay. They're learning.
Keep going.

464
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:41,413
Danny and Matt.

465

00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:47,896
with this first ball.

469
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,172
HEIDI: Breathe.

470
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:54,172
PROBST: Can they land it
without dropping it off the back end?

471
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:56,000
That's the risk now.

472
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:58,689
And they do.
Soka has their first.

473
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:02,896
- Yes, Soka!
- Beautiful! Do it again!

474
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,172
Too much.

PROBST: Yam Yam and
josh have to start again for Tika.

476
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,344

And they do.

478
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:13,724
- Yes! - Yes.
- Ratu has one. We're tied.

479

It is one-one,

Do they have
the touch this time?

00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:32,551
Here comes Ratu
right on their tail.

515
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:34,965
For the win.

516
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:37,344
Can they save it?

517
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:38,931
They are on the edge
of disaster.

518
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:40,206
HEIDI: Bring it back.

519
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,620
PROBST: And they bring it back.

520
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:43,827
Ratu is right there.

521
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:46,206
Ratu pulls it out!
Ratu wins immunity.

522
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,206
We're looking for one more!

523
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,137
It could be over right here
for Soka

524
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:51,862
if they can close it out.

525
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:56,655
And they do!
Soka wins immunity, sending Tika

526
00:21:56,758 --> 00:21:58,862
back to Tribal Council

527
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,689
where Carolyn, Josh or Yam Yam
will be the sixth person

528
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:04,344
voted out of Survivor44.

529
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,310
ALL: Soka! Soka! Soka!

530
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:13,655
Jeff, I always wondered
if the matches were as close

531
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:14,958
- as on TV, and...
- They were.

532
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,413
PROBST: They are.

533
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:18,862
- It was seconds.
- Yeah, everyone out here.

534
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:23,310
Ratu, the sword is yours.

535
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,586
Immunity for Soka as well.

536
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:30,689
All right, now,
you have power, Ratu.

537
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:33,620
You're gonna decide which three
players... one from your tribe,

538
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:35,068
one from Soka, one from Tika...

539
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:36,532
Are gonna go
on a journey together.

540
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,275
I'm gonna be going on a journey.

541
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,482
Let's talk about Soka.

542
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:45,931
We like Danny.
We pick Danny to go.

543
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:47,785
- PROBST: All right, Danny going on a journey.
- All right.

544
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:49,931
All right,
you got one last decision.

545
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:53,758
You have Yam Yam,
Josh and Carolyn.

546
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:58,068
Who you gonna pick to join
as the third player?

547
00:22:58,172 --> 00:22:59,931
We're sending Carolyn.

548
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:03,931
PROBST: All right, it's gonna
be Brandon, Danny and Carolyn.

549
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:06,034
Head out.
Boat will take you out.

550
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,448
Carolyn, you will return
in time for Tribal Council.

551
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:11,061
- [indistinct chatter] - Have fun.
- FRANNIE: You got it, Danny boy.

552
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:13,448
- Have fun. - Okay.
- Yeah.

553
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:15,551
PROBST:
Soka, Ratu, no Tribal Council,

554
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,775
nobody going home. Grab
your stuff, head back to camp.

555
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:20,026
But Matthew, just given that
you've sat out two challenges,

556
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:21,758
and it's clear
you have an injury,

557
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:24,130
I'd like medical to take a look
at that and just get an update.

558
00:23:24,172 --> 00:23:25,517
- So you can stick around.
- Okay.

559
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,682
PROBST:
Okay, grab your stuff, head out.

560
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:28,517
- Enjoy the night off.
- Jeff!

561
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,965
Well earned.

562
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:34,034
All right, Yam Yam and Josh,

563
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:36,862
Carolyn will return
in time for Tribal Council.

564
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:38,931
Somebody will be
the sixth person voted out.

565
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,716
As a penalty for losing,
I'll hold on to your flint.

566
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:42,206
You'll have another chance
to earn it

567
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,724
at your next immunity challenge.

568
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:46,172
Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight at Tribal.

569
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,406
YAM YAM: I don't think
people understand how hard it is

570
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:51,862
to be only three of us
at Tribal Council.

571
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,000
I don't think
Survivorgets harder than this.

572
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:56,034
Especially me being out
of the last vote.

573
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:58,586
Like, what power do I have?
I have nothing.

574
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:00,329
I don't want to work
with Josh or Carolyn,

575
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:01,827
but it's like, "Hello.

576
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:05,000
We cannot vote the coconut
palm tree out, you know?"

577
00:24:13,172 --> 00:24:14,716
WILL: So I just thought
we'd have a look

578
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:16,241
at your shoulder again
because I know

579
00:24:16,344 --> 00:24:17,744
you've been struggling,
haven't you?

580
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:19,344
MATTHEW: Yeah, I have been.

581
00:24:19,448 --> 00:24:21,275
Like, the pain
has been really bad.

582
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:23,931
- Mm.
- And it's just...

583
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:26,827
It's so weak
that I can't even, like...

584
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:30,172
I feel like gravity's gonna pull
it out of the socket.

585
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:34,310
And, uh... and I'm just,
like, really worried

586
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:36,034
because, you know,
I'm only eating, like,

587
00:24:36,137 --> 00:24:38,000
a couple hundred calories a day,

588
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:42,620
and I just don't know,
like, how well my body can heal

589
00:24:42,724 --> 00:24:45,344
under the conditions
that I'm in.

590
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:47,206
PROBST: Will, can you explain

591
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,068
why is he feeling so much pain?

592
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:51,206
- 'Cause it's clear he's hurting.
- Yeah.

593
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,000
What happens when you pop your
shoulder out, Matt is the...

594
00:24:54,103 --> 00:24:56,931
the soft tissue that holds
the shoulder in place...

595
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:58,310
That can get torn.

596
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,689
And if it's a small tear,

597
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,068
then the pain
is usually quite short-lived.

598
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:08,931
- But you're in a lot of pain, and this is nine days on.
- Yeah.

599
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:11,689
I got to say,
I'm very impressed.

600
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:14,103
You got injured
playing the game.

601
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:16,413
You fought through it,
you tried to hide it.

602
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,000
Sometimes you had the sling on.

603
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:19,682
Other times,
you didn't have the sling on.

604
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:22,344
When challenges came up
that you could have sat out

605
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:23,862
to try to preserve
your own health,

606
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:25,448
you fought for your tribe,

607
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:29,034
and I've watched you
lift a very heavy box.

608
00:25:29,137 --> 00:25:31,068
I watched you slap at the keys.

609
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:33,137
So what is it? Is it just drive?

610
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,586
- 'Cause I know we've been advising you not to.
- It...

611
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:37,793
It's painful, but I'm not one

612
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:41,655
to give up on something
that I want so badly.

613
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:44,241
Doctor told me that
I probably tore something

614
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:46,172
in my shoulder, and...

615
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:48,103
I want to be out here.

616
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:52,275
This is a dream of mine,
but I wake up in so much pain.

617
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:57,344
Just got a lot weighing
on my mind, 'cause I got

618
00:25:57,448 --> 00:25:59,103
to figure out what I should do.

619
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:17,965
- We were right there with them.
- We were.

620
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:19,793
- Sorry, dude.
- No, it's okay.

621
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:22,206
Good effort, though.

622
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,241
The immunity challenge
was rough.

623
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:28,448
Tika lost, and now
we're going to Tribal Council.

624
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:30,137
Fortunately,

625
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:32,689
it seems like Yam Yam really
believes that I do have an idol,

626
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:35,448
which I'm using
and banking on because

627
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:37,862
that lie is the only thing
that I have going forward.

628
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:40,137
So I'd like
to save my idol if I can.

629
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:42,965
Obviously,
I'm using two in a row.

630
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,310
That's your...
that's your decision.

631
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:48,724
We obviously were on different
sides of last Tribal Council.

632
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:50,241
I want you to understand...

633
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:51,613
I understand.
Oh, yeah, I understand it.

634
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:53,275
...how it went down.

635
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,164
But I just want to make sure
it doesn't happen again further.

636
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,785
- It's not gonna happen again.
- 'Cause we're working together.

637
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:58,586
Because here's the thing.

638
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:01,689
- Carolyn is playing both me and you.
- Right.

639
00:27:01,793 --> 00:27:06,310
She is not as unaware
as it looks she is.

640
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:08,793
She proved it
with the Sarah vote.

641
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:11,137
And she made you use your idol
when you needed me to.

642
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:13,517
Do you think
that was a mistake or a...

643
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,827
a fluke or whatever it's called?

644
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:18,137
She's thinking.

645
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,793
If Josh has an idol,
I have to save my own ass.

646
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:22,172
So,

647
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,758
I'm throwing Carolyn
under the bus, the train,

648
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:26,827
the airplane, the submarine,
going back and forth.

649
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:29,793
[trilling]

650
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,517
Hoping I come out alive,
you know?

651
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,965
Like, I can't trust her.

652
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,965
Like, she's too emotional.

653
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:37,068
And what
you're saying makes sense.

654
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:38,896
- She's the ticking time bomb.
- Yes.

655
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,103
So, when Carolyn comes back,

656
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:43,475
let's see what she tells you that
she has, -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

657
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:45,689
- And let's see what she tells me.
- Okay.

658
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:47,406
And then see what kind of game
she's playing.

659
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:49,724
While Carolyn and Yam Yam want
to work with me,

660
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:51,413
Carolyn went on a journey,

661
00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:54,068
and who knows what
she might come back with?

662
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,137
She could lose her vote, she
could have a Knowledge Is Power.

663
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,517
She could have
an immunity idol. Who knows?

664
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,820
But it could change everything.

665
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,061
All right,
I'm gonna shake on it.

666
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:05,344
- Let's shake it. I'm for real.
- Oh.

667
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:07,517
- We're in this. All right.
- For real. Okay.

668
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,241
JOSH: Perfect.

669
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,827
BRANDON: I was happy
to be going on the journey

670
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:17,475
because I figured
something could come of it,

671
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:20,655
but at the same time, I'm
immediately thinking, you know,

672
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:22,233
"what am I gonna say
when I get back?"

673
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:23,820
Because there's been
so many journeys that have been

674
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,785
taking place already,
and they're gonna be looking

675
00:28:25,827 --> 00:28:27,827
for me to come back
with some sort of advantage.

676
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:32,724
- All right.
- Let's go.

677
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:34,310
- Yeah.
- All right.

678
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,172
DANNY: It's you guys'
first journey, right?

679
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:37,785
- CAROLYN: First journey.
- DANNY: Oh, dude.

680
00:28:37,827 --> 00:28:39,068
Hopefully, it doesn't suck.

681
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:40,475
- [Danny laughs]
- BRANDON: I know.

682
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,620
[Carolyn screams]

683
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:49,000
There's a sign here.

684
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh, we got another sign.
All right.

685
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:53,655
- Oh, yeah.
- What's this?

686
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:03,448
Shut up.

687
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,620
- CAROLYN: Is this serious?
- Ooh!

688
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:09,413
- Ooh, boy!
- [Carolyn shrieks]

689
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:10,923
DANNY: And nobody
is gonna believe this,

690
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,026
- But I don't care right now.
- BRANDON: Nah, nah, nah.

691
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:13,448
BRANDON: We all were like,

692
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,689
"There's some catch.
There's no way this is real."

693
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:17,137
But sure enough, it was.

694
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:19,413
- Boom. Yeah, let's go in.
- Go in?

695
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:22,793
I don't eat meat,
but I do on Survivor.

696
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,337
Even though I was super,
super nervous

697
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:26,344
because we're going to Tribal,

698
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:28,586
it kind of felt good.
I was like, "I am starving."

699
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:31,379
This is an opportunity,
me coming from a tribe

700
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:33,682
of three people, where I'm
gonna get to know these guys,

701
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:34,827
maybe gain more allies

702
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:36,689
and just feel better
in the game.

703
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:38,275
What's going over at Tika?

704
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:39,509
'Cause that's the real question
I'd like y'all to answer.

705
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:40,911
DANNY:
Yeah, what's going on there?

706
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,206
How do you think it's gonna
go down tonight for you?

707
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm worried!
I'm sorry to yell at you.

708
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:46,413
No, no, please do. I would...

709
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:47,785
I would feel the same way
if I was you.

710
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,000
It's a tough spot for you.

711
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,931
I'm worried
because Josh came back

712
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:53,655
with an idol from the journey

713
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,820
- that he could only use up to the merge...
- Oh, actually...

714
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,820
- until... We used it.
- ...that means Jaime has one.

715
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,130
- BRANDON: And so does Carson.
- And Carson.

716
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,103
This right now is a disadvantage

717
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:03,137
unless, like,
we get to the merge

718
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:05,522
- and we, like, work together, and then...
- Ah, for real.

719
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,965
DANNY: I couldn't have been
more grateful for this journey.

720
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:10,172
Between the food,
the information,

721
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,620
I don't know what tasted better.

722
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:13,172
I also got some time
with Brandon.

723
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:15,827
We hit it off 100%.

724
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:17,448
We were thinking
the exact same thing.

725
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:19,061
- I've been wanting to work with you.
- Yeah, absolutely.

726
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:20,475
So, I'm happ...
That's why I was like,

727
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:22,103
"I want to make sure
Danny goes on it."

728
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:23,965
So, I'll give you my word
right now,

729
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:26,337
we get to the merge, I'll get me
and whoever else I'm with.

730
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,268
- And vice versa.
- Am I in on this, or am I still...

731
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,910
- Absolutely.
- Here's the thing, though.

732
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,647
- I said, hope... - Okay, yeah.
- I've been wanting to work...

733
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:33,413
CAROLYN: I was excited
to go on the journey

734
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,206
and just experience
the whole experience.

735
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,854
So I'm gonna get to
talk to Brandon, I'm gonna

736
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:38,233
get to talk to Danny.
Like, this is great.

737
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:42,000
But the conversation immediately

738
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:46,206
just becomes... those two.

739
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,310
DANNY: I'll tell you
right now, the beauty of

740
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,013
you and I getting
to link up right now...

741
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:52,758
- People like us very rarely win.
- I know.

742
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:54,379
And what do you mean
"people like us"?

743
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:56,578
[mutters] People who are looked
at as more physical threats.

744
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,482
DANNY: Our enemies
are gonna be everybody

745
00:30:58,586 --> 00:31:00,827
who's intimidated by us
and our physicality.

746
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:03,103
That was exactly why
I wanted to meet you.

747
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:05,268
- Yeah, well, I'm glad you guys worked it out.
- Yeah.

748
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,275
- I hope...
- I hope you make it through tonight.

749
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:08,958
CAROLYN: They don't even care.
It's like I'm not even there.

750
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,965
It didn't even matter.

751
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,337
I wanted
to work with you anyway.

752
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:12,682
- I wanted to work with you, too.
- And I want

753
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:14,026
to ask about your tattoos
because I love 'em.

754
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:15,337
Yeah, man. I love Achilles,
so I got...

755
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:16,613
- Oh, it's Achilles?
- Yeah, it's Achilles.

756
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:18,379
- Is there no one else?
- Yeah.

757
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:20,241
- DANNY: Is there no one else?
- Exactly.

758
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:21,862
CAROLYN: So they're bro-ing.

759
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:24,034
Meanwhile, I'm just here.

760
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:26,241
Me and you, maybe Josh...

761
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:28,310
That's money
in the bank right there.

762
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:30,413
So we meet up in the merge,
you give me a name.

763
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,647
- Yeah.
- And we take out whoever.

764
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,889
- Good luck, guys.
- I'm so surprised.

765
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:34,379
CAROLYN: What the hell?!

766
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:36,586
I'm already gone to them.

767
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:38,268
Well, who would you want
to take out, Carolyn?

768
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,578
BRANDON: Yeah, who would
you want to take out, Carolyn?

769
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,310
I'm not gonna tell you guys
because

770
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:43,310
uh, what I need is allies.

771
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:46,233
I don't need...
I'm not trying to, like,

772
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:47,724
go in and target people.

773
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:50,551
- I need people that I can trust.
- BRANDON: Honestly,

774
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:52,475
- like, I don't mean this in a mean way.
- Say it.

775
00:31:52,517 --> 00:31:54,509
I feel like you'd be somebody
to keep around because

776
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:56,302
you haven't proven yourself
to do very well on challenges.

777
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:58,275
- [laughs]
- So I'm just being honest.

778
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:01,862
- I love that. I love that.
- You know, I'm being honest.

779
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:03,586
I couldn't believe it.

780
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,965
People might look at me
and underestimate me

781
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:08,965
and think I'm just goofing
around out here,

782
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:10,689
but I'm playing.

783
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:13,620
I found an immunity idol,
planted a fake immunity idol.

784
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,137
I've planned
a successful blindside.

785
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:18,724
So they better watch out for me
at the merge

786
00:32:18,827 --> 00:32:20,862
because I will make the merge.

787
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:26,517
Yes!

788
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:33,931
This adventure could be yours.
Apply to be on Survivor.

789
00:32:42,137 --> 00:32:44,655
Here she comes.

790
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:50,413
JOSH: Wow.

791
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,275
How was it?

792
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:54,965
Really good.

793
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:58,137
This journey
has big-time affected

794
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,517
the way I'm gonna vote today

795
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,724
because I don't want anything
to do

796
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:05,344
with Danny
and the muscle bro thing.

797
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:07,344
And Josh is a part of that.

798
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:11,000
So I almost jumped off that boat
into Yam Yam's arms.

799
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:13,724
[mouthing]

800
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:18,000
JOSH: So you didn't walk up,
like, a mountain or anything?

801
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:21,482
No. It just said,
"Today, no advantages,

802
00:33:21,586 --> 00:33:23,137
no risking your vote."

803
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:26,103
And then, it was, like,
a big spread of food.

804
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:28,137
JOSH:
I'm cutting up a papaya then.

805
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:30,000
CAROLYN: Cut one up.

806
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:32,620
[mouthing]

807
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:35,241
YAM YAM: As soon
as Carolyn gets back to camp,

808
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:37,206
she's mouthing,
"Everything's okay."

809
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,827
"Everything's cool,
we're fine, don't worry,"

810
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:41,482
every time
he has his back at her.

811
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,931
I'm like, this is the Carolyn
I know, you know? She came back.

812
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:47,137
Hey, Carolyn. How you doing?
I've been missing you.

813
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:50,965
CAROLYN: I was having
lunch with two people

814
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:54,137
who were so obsessed
with each other

815
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:57,482
and how
they are such big threats.

816
00:33:57,586 --> 00:33:59,482
- They bro'd out?
- Yeah.

817
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:02,413
And then they just sat
and talked about how

818
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:04,061
you're a good guy
and that you're really smart,

819
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:08,585
and if you make it,
we can team up at merge.

820
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:11,379
JOSH: Carolyn came back upset
about what Danny

821
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,862
and Brandon were talking about,

822
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:14,965
about, like a meat brigade,
basically.

823
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:18,172
And they made it seem like
I'm a part of it, which I'm not.

824
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:20,379
But now, that's gonna put
another target on my back.

825
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:21,578
So they basically,
like, were like,

826
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,820
"Yam Yam's dead in the water."

827
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:26,965
So, they-they basically...

828
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:28,862
I mean, I have my idol,
so I amfine, so...

829
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:30,896
- Yeah. [Laughs]
- Yeah.

830
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,688
CAROLYN:
You have another idol, too?

831
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:34,310
I do...

832
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:36,137
- that I'm playing tonight.
- CAROLYN: Okay.

833
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,275
JOSH: So...

834
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:40,172
CAROLYN: Did you see
it, Yam Yam... his idol?

835
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,000
JOSH: No.

836
00:34:57,758 --> 00:34:59,586
JOSH: They're not.

837
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:01,310
I wouldn't lie.

838
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:02,689
It's not.

839
00:35:02,793 --> 00:35:04,310
YAM YAM: Mm-hmm.

840
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:08,103
CAROLYN: So he takes
out the exact same note

841
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,275
that he showed me two days ago
that he used on the last Tribal.

842
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:13,724
What, does he not think
I read it the last time?

843
00:35:13,827 --> 00:35:15,655
I'm not stupid.

844
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:18,068
Can you not destroy it for me?

845
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:20,275
- I didn't do anything.
- Come on.

846
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,206
- It came apart.
- You're...

847
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:26,379
YAM YAM: Josh is
sketchy, sketchy, sketchy.

848
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:27,620
I mean, he pulls out

849
00:35:27,724 --> 00:35:29,620
this freaking fake idol.

850
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:32,137
[laughing]

851
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:34,655
The beads were fake.

852
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:41,172
This idol is so fake.

853
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:45,206
Whatever. I need to, like...
I'm gonna fill my water.

854
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,095
YAM YAM: Does that mean
I'm working with Carolyn?

855
00:35:47,137 --> 00:35:49,241
I don't know. Does that mean
I'm working with Josh?

856
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:51,241
I don't know.
I still have to figure it out.

857
00:35:57,862 --> 00:36:01,482
I know. I'm nervous about that.

858
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:03,682
Carolyn may or may not have
an advantage or immunity idol,

859
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:06,137
which makes me nervous for sure.

860
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:08,655
But I still want her out
because now she feels like

861
00:36:08,758 --> 00:36:10,275
that I'm in an alliance

862
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,620
with bros, trying to get
all the girls out or something.

863
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:17,068
Let's get her out.

864
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:20,103
But to do this,
I need Yam Yam on my side.

865
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:22,517
Yes, I have
my fake immunity idol,

866
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,827
but Yam Yam's
kind of onto me, so,

867
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:27,275
I feel vulnerable,
I'm frustrated, I'm scared.

868
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:30,551
But adversity is my middle name.

869
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,896
I was born with something called
Guillain-Barré syndrome.

870
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,724
I had weak kidneys.

871
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,854
They didn't think I was
going to make it past age five.

872
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,000
Miraculously, I did.

873
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:41,783
But at age nine,
I had a kidney transplant.

874
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,379
Because of that,

875
00:36:43,482 --> 00:36:44,992
I've been on immunosuppressant
medications all my life.

876
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:46,793
And from that, when I turned 25,

877
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:49,275
I was diagnosed
with cancer of the stomach,

878
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:52,655
and they also found signs
of B-cell lymphoma.

879
00:36:52,758 --> 00:36:55,000
So I had to have
a total stomach removal

880
00:36:55,103 --> 00:36:56,551
my first year of medical school.

881
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:59,172
I still graduated
at the top of my class,

882
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:00,965
and I'm a successful
physician now.

883
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:04,310
So I take negative situations
and turn them

884
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:05,965
into positive outcomes.

885
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:09,448
So now, I just need to step up
and do that again.

886
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,620
YAM YAM: Josh wants
to get rid of Carolyn bad.

887
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:16,275
But with that fake idol,

888
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:18,448
I don't know if I can trust him.
That's the thing.

889
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:20,931
Like, I don't know if
we're working together or not.

890
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:23,517
So maybe
I should go with Carolyn.

891
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:33,551
Listen.

892
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:35,310
I'm here.

893
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,275
Like, I know I love you.

894
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:43,758
...you can't trust me, and you
want to turn your back on it.

895
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:44,931
But I'm sorry.

896
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:49,413
I don't want to go
with his bros alliance.

897
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,758
I made sure to let Yam Yam know,

898
00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:54,241
"I am so sorry that I ever
strayed away from you, and,

899
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:57,379
like, I will never, ever, ever,
do that again. Please. Please."

900
00:37:57,482 --> 00:37:59,482
But because
I left him out of that vote,

901
00:37:59,586 --> 00:38:01,620
he just does not trust me.

902
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,448
Are you...? Dude, just stop.

903
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:10,586
Just... Don't... don't...

904
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,344
I don't have the stupid idol.

905
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:15,000
The truth is, I do have an idol,

906
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:17,344
but I don't want to use it.
Like, it's too early.

907
00:38:17,448 --> 00:38:19,758
But Yam Yam's just freaking out.

908
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:21,206
So,

909
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,206
how do I build back the trust
with Yam Yam?

910
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,000
It's just something
I'm gonna have to just hope

911
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,517
and take that risk
that he want...

912
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,000
like, he's with me.

913
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:32,379
Take it. Yes!

914
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:34,509
YAM YAM: But she's worried
that I don't trust her anymore,

915
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:36,896
and I kind of don't.

916
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:42,965
YAM YAM: At this point,

917
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,586
I think I have the trust
of both of them.

918
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:47,310
I'm happy I'm back on top,

919
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:50,758
but I'm not sure
what's best for me in the end.

920
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:54,793
So this is a huge vote,
and whatever I do,

921
00:38:54,896 --> 00:38:57,068
I hope it doesn't bite me
in the ass, you know?

922
00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:03,206
[engine rumbling]

923
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:08,172
Is that Jeff?

924
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:11,586
Jeff's here.

925
00:39:11,689 --> 00:39:14,689
- That's Jeff. What happened?
- No freaking way.

926
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:16,827
We're sitting at camp,
waiting to go to Tribal,

927
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:18,724
and all of a sudden,
Jeff arrives in a boat,

928
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:21,551
and I was like,
"What's going on?"

929
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:25,206
- Welcome to Tika! - Ah!
- Ah!

930
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:28,793
All right. First of all,
I have a question.

931
00:39:28,896 --> 00:39:31,896
Before I got here,
what was happening in terms

932
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,647
of heart rate?
Because you all look very calm

933
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:35,199
for three people
who are ready to go to Tribal.

934
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:36,448
- We're not.
- We're not.

935
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:38,275
Outside, we are. Inside, I am...

936
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:39,820
- We're playing it cool.
- My pulse is through the roof.

937
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:41,965
I'm so anxious.
In the back of my mind,

938
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:43,647
I was like,
"Well, I'm done. This is it."

939
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:46,793
- All right. So curious why I'm here?
- JOSH: Yes.

940
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:49,344
No. Matthew left the game?

941
00:39:49,448 --> 00:39:52,137
Matthew is no longer
in the game...

942
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,095
- YAM YAM: No way. That sucks.
- Due to his shoulder.

943
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:55,417
PROBST:
The pain became too much.

944
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:56,854
- He couldn't take it anymore.
- YAM YAM: No. No.

945
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,586
And he wisely opted
to take care of himself

946
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,310
- long term.
- YAM YAM: No way.

947
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:05,172
Matthew had to leave the game
because of his shoulder injury.

948
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:07,068
That sucks. Like,

949
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,862
he wanted to be here, and
he pushed through all that pain

950
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:12,379
and all those days
of that injury.

951
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:16,896
The fact that the game can
change so fast... that's scary.

952
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,413
That sucks. If you want
to go out with your...

953
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,448
You know, have your moment.

954
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:23,241
Hey, Survivoris not easy.

955
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:25,104
And Matthew is
a really good example of that.

956
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,172
Hurts himself on day two,

957
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:31,413
and nine days later,
is over. So,

958
00:40:31,517 --> 00:40:35,241
Matthew's, bad news
is your good fortune.

959
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:36,586
That means

960
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:38,206
there is no Tribal Council.

961
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,689
- YAM YAM: Stop it.
- But I'm sorry that he went home.

962
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:43,913
You're not going home.
Carolyn, you're not going home.

963
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,379
Yam Yam, you're not going home.

964
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:48,475
JOSH: I know Matt really
wanted to be in this game.

965
00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:50,931
This is everyone's
dream come true.

966
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:53,793
But him going home
allows me to be safe,

967
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:55,482
and it starts over my game,

968
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,758
because five minutes ago, I'm
thinking they might vote me out.

969
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:01,172
So, this is a new beginning.

970
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:02,613
PROBST:
Well, this is a great example

971
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:05,000
of the absolutely

972
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:09,517
unpredictable nature of Survivor

973
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,689
because this could completely
change the direction of the game

974
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:15,310
because you're all three
still here.

975
00:41:15,413 --> 00:41:18,310
- That was not supposed to be the case.
- No.

976
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:20,716
One of you was supposed to be
going home in a couple of hours.

977
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:23,379
You're not.
So what was supposed to happen

978
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:25,689
is now not going to happen.

979
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:28,965
And the question is
what will happen instead?

980
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:30,130
- [laughs]
- All right, have a good night.

981
00:41:30,172 --> 00:41:31,310
Thank you, Jeff.

982
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:34,448
- So scared. [Groans]
- Good night.

983
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:36,371
Carolyn, why do you think
this is such a bad thing? Girl!

984
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,551
'Cause...

985
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:41,034
- [Carolyn laughs] - It's obviously... but...
- Ah!

986
00:41:41,137 --> 00:41:42,827
CAROLYN: I thought I
would be more excited

987
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:45,827
not gonna Tribal,
but it's kind of the opposite

988
00:41:45,931 --> 00:41:47,551
because I wanted
to get Josh out.

989
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:51,482
So I'm frustrated,
I'm annoyed, I'm pissed off.

990
00:41:51,586 --> 00:41:53,413
[Carolyn groans]

991
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:56,068
I don't want nothing
to do with you, Josh.

I am so excited!

What the ...?!

1000
00:42:24,344 --> 00:42:25,448
Betrayal.

1001
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:27,068
MATT: My mind is spinning.

1002
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,965
Now we're playingSurvivor
with a capital "S."

1003
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:35,026
I came out here for the journey,
and in a lot of ways,

1004
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:36,724
I achieved a lot of goals.

1005
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:39,206
Was the journey
a little bit short? Absolutely.

1006
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,103
But I feel like
I'm leaving the game

1007
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:44,758
a much stronger person,
and I know I have the skills

1008
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,517
to get wherever I want to go.

1009
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,344
The only regret that I have is

1010
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:51,862
I shouldn't have
climbed that rock. [Laughs]
