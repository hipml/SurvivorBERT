JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,923
<i>16 strangers were marooned</i>
<i>on Taratao Island</i>

3
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>in exotic Thailand.</i>

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,094
<i>The two oldest survivors,</i>
<i>Jan and Jake,</i>

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,096
<i>were allowed to choose</i>
<i>their own tribes.</i>

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,433
JAN:<i> When Jeff said that</i>
<i>we were picking the tribes,</i>

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,101
I really did kind of get scared.

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,770
PROBST:<i> Jan chose an older group</i>
<i>for her tribe, Chuay Gahn,</i>

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,107
<i>while Jake went with</i>
<i>youth and brawn for Sook Jai.</i>

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,443
JAKE:<i> I based picking a team</i>
<i>on athleticism</i>

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,111
<i>and just that gleam</i>
<i>in their eye.</i>

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,612
PROBST:
<i>The Chuay Gahn tribe found</i>

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,156
<i>a ready-made shelter</i>
<i>on their beach.</i>

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,407
We got a natural cave
and everything.

15
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,744
PROBST:<i> But their water hole</i>
<i>was far from camp</i>

16
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,579
<i>-and difficult to find.</i>
<i>-There's no way that we're</i>

17
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,414
supposed to be able to
come up here every couple days

18
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,124
with a big huge gallon jug.

19
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,127
PROBST:<i> The Sook Jai tribe</i>
<i>found their water hole nearby.</i>

20
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,295
Yeah!

21
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,463
PROBST:
<i>But the tribe butted heads</i>

22
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,839
<i>over their shelter.</i>

23
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,299
ROBB:<i> So many people are</i>
<i>going so many directions</i>

24
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,341
and they're not
producing anything.

25
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,135
PROBST:
<i>Back at Chuay Gahn,</i>

26
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>Tanya was feeling sick.</i>

27
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,097
I don't think I drank
enough water yesterday.

28
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,098
Go!

29
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,475
<i>At the first</i>
<i>immunity challenge,</i>

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,268
<i>the older Chuay Gahn tribe</i>
<i>surprised everyone</i>

31
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>by taking an early lead.</i>

32
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,813
<i>But Ghandia gave it away</i>

33
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,648
<i>when she struggled</i>
<i>with the sliding puzzle.</i>

34
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,941
Hurry up! Hurry up!

35
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,360
Sook Jai wins immunity!

36
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,280
<i>Chuay Gahn went to Tribal</i>
<i>Council, where Pastor John</i>

37
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,991
<i>was the first person</i>
<i>voted out of the tribe.</i>

38
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:17,118
The tribe has spoken.

39
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,328
<i>15 are left.</i>

40
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,289
<i>Who will be the next to go?</i>

41
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,451
(snoring)

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,419
(snoring continues)

43
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,759
(snickering)

44
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,927
What?

45
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,430
(laughing)

46
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:05,101
You're snoring.

47
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,770
Oh, Lord, with all that snoring,
I didn't get no sleep.

48
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,480
HELEN:<i> As a tribe,</i>
<i>you do sleep in</i>

49
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,775
<i>very close quarters,</i>
<i>and it's hard.</i>

50
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,485
<i>Clay snores. I don't know</i>
<i>how a guy that's only, like,</i>

51
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,447
five-five has that much sound
coming out of his body.

52
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,324
<i>But out here, quite frankly,</i>

53
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,118
<i>by the time</i>
<i>everybody hits the sack,</i>

54
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,037
we're exhausted.

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,579
Ready to roll?

56
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,456
Let's rock and roll.

57
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,458
One, two, three.

58
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,087
(groaning):
Oh.

59
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,088
We're almost there.

60
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,381
(groaning):
Oh.

61
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,301
GHANDIA:<i> The boat that we have</i>
<i>is a piece of crap.</i>

62
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,469
<i>It fills with sand,</i>
<i>it fills with water,</i>

63
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,639
we have to tip it over,
it's extremely heavy.

64
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,434
<i>With our water source</i>
<i>being as far away as it is,</i>

65
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,478
<i>it just makes the journey</i>
<i>to go get water</i>

66
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,021
even more frustrating.

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,320
CLAY:<i> Helen and Jan</i>
<i>didn't take the map with them;</i>

68
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,488
<i>they thought</i>
<i>they could figure it out.</i>

69
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,032
<i>And that's one of</i>
<i>Helen's deals.</i>

70
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,700
<i>"I know where it is,</i>
<i>I know how to do it. Let's go."</i>

71
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,743
<i>When she doesn't.</i>

72
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,786
That's the first thing we asked.

73
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,995
Well, didn't they take the map?

74
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,413
We turn around
and there's the map.

75
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,839
-Okay, you're going.
-Yep.

76
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,674
Take the strap.

77
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,009
Okay, when you come back,
I'll go.

78
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:20,551
All right.

79
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,429
Gives me a little rest.

80
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,743
(sighs)

81
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,911
I don't think
this is right, Jan.

82
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,416
HELEN:<i> We went beyond</i>
<i>the right cove into</i>

83
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,002
<i>the absolute wrong cove.</i>

84
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,378
<i>That was, like,</i>

85
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,880
huge, huge mistake.

86
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,718
<i>It looked like it was</i>
<i>honeycombed with snake holes.</i>

87
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,177
<i>And Jan</i>

88
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,762
nicely volunteered
to stay with the boat

89
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,847
on all the explorations.

90
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,310
Think maybe it was
that first alcove we went into?

91
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,563
Yeah.

92
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,699
TED:
<i>This is a--</i>

93
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,076
That's par three
or par four right here?

94
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,077
Where's the hole?
Right there?

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,412
Oh, it's got to be a par three.

96
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,580
This is a par three?

97
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,206
-There's the tee box.
-Okay, cool.

98
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,584
Ooh! Ooh!

CLAY:
<i>My luxury item is a golf club,</i>

100

105
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,430
CLAY:
<i>And we're in top competition.</i>

106
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,556
<i>They're both ahead of me</i>
<i>two shots,</i>

107
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,600

the luxury item here.

108
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,561
Here goes Clay...

109
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,646
Ooh, nice-- Oh!

110
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,566
-Oh!

HELEN:<i> Stupidly, we kept going</i>
<i>in the wrong direction.</i>

114
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,584
<i>We got into</i>
<i>a wicked bad current.</i>

115
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,962
<i>And Jan's a nice lady</i>
<i>and strong swimmer,</i>

116
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,298
<i>but she's not as strong</i>
<i>as I am upper body.</i>

117
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,926
So I'm, like, compensating
in the back, and she just--

118
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,427
<i>She's older than I am.</i>

119
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,637
<i>She definitely--</i>
<i>you can look at her--</i>

120
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,597
<i>she doesn't have as much</i>
<i>upper body strength.</i>

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,975
<i>So I can't get mad at that;</i>
<i>that's just a physical fact.</i>

122
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,603
This looks like the beach more,

123
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,729
the one that we swam to.

124
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,606
HELEN:<i> It was a nightmare.</i>
<i>At one point,</i>

125
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,942
<i>I was about ready--</i>
<i>if I had a pistol</i>

126
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,443
<i>in my pocket,</i>
<i>I would have pulled it out,</i>

127
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,654
shot her first, shot me second.

128
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,490
That's why I don't carry a gun.

JAKE:<i> The number one priority</i>

<i>for four days out here,</i>

131
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,545
to get us
a really nice shelter built.

132
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,173
<i>It's really important because,</i>

133
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,384
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>we're in the monsoon season.</i>

134
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,469
Do you want to guarantee
being dry?

135
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,389
When the rain comes,
the water hits this,

136
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,141
it pours it down into the gutter

137
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,642
and the gutter just
pours it right off.

138
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,352
All right, well,
let's get cracking.

139
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,439
JAKE:
<i>The shelter has become almost</i>

140
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,358
<i>an obsession to the tribe.</i>

141
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:25,528
<i>But Stephanie and Jed have not</i>
<i>worked on the hut very much,</i>

142
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,696
<i>which has caused problems with</i>

144
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,367
It'd be great
if somebody out there

145
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,369
could collect some more
of this rope.

146
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,370
Jed ain't doing anything.

147
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,746
You think he cares?

00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,208
Well, no,
I know he doesn't care,

150
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,668

00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,221
You know, you're putting it
in everybody's face

157
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,890
that you're not going to do
a damn thing.

-I mean, I know

shelter's important, but I just
can't get into that right now.

JED:<i> Spending your energy</i>
<i>building a shelter</i>

<i>seems kind of frivolous to me.</i>

163
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,904
I mean, it's the fourth day

Oh, Lord.

Hey, there's a monkey
up there listening to you.

351
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,088
Oh, there is a monkey
right there looking at us.

352
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,589
-See him moving right now?
-Oh, yes, I do!

353
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,924

CLAY:<i> We looked up in the tree,</i>

356
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,430
<i>up there in the tree--</i>
<i>wasn't 100 feet from us.</i>

357
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,974
Just like he had come to sit in
for a concert or something.

358
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,350
Just that curious, I guess.

359
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,437
Attagirl.

360
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,606
Oh, I'm not good at pouring.

<i>-Salud.</i>

<i>Saluté. Saluté.</i>

364
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,237
(sighs)

365
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,239
That's my champagne toast
for my anniversary.

366
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,240
Mm-hmm.

367
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,995
HELEN:<i> It's my 20th</i>
<i>wedding anniversary.</i>

368
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,289
I'm thinking about my husband
today, and, you know,

369
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,373
be nice to be home
and have a candlelight dinner,

370
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,084
but he knows where I am
and what I'm doing, so...

371
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,670
<i>I'll celebrate when I get back.</i>

372
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,632
I think it would
really mean a lot to her

373
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,134
if we do do
a little celebration.

374
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,135
Mm-hmm.

375
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,095
'Cause, you know,

376
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,305
it's her 20-year anniversary.

377
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,556
Yeah.

378
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,854
TANYA:<i> Today is Helen's 20th</i>
<i>anniversary with her husband,</i>

379
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,314
<i>and so she can't be with him.</i>

380
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,691
<i>We picked some flowers</i>
<i>and we're going to make</i>

381
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,819
<i>a little crown for her,</i>
<i>for her to wear tonight.</i>

382
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,820
Think this is
going to make her cry.

383
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,865
It's a secret;
she doesn't know about it, so...

384
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,368
You try it on.

385
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,828
Oh, it's lovely.

386
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,121
-Cute?
-Yeah.

387
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,040
-Now we got to hide it.
-Okay.

388
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,048
See if there's anything
in there.

389
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,674
All right.

390
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,843
Yep, we got mail.

391
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,845
Uh-oh.

392
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,388
Y'all better hurry; we got mail!

393
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,182
We interrupt this program
for a special report.

394
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,226
(laughter)

395
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,312
-Okay.
-Uh-oh.

396
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:30,108
"Life's not so cush
running around in the bush,

397
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,694
"Have blind faith
in the one that you choose,

398
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,031
"So carry the weight
or seal your tribe's fate,

399
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,408
You'll miss great rewards
if you lose."

400
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,660
Yep, I bet you any money...

401
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,619
This is a food reward.

402
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,996
Somebody's going to be
blindfolded and have to

403
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,164
run through the bush
or something,

404
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,124
and we'll have to direct...

405
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,667
JAN: And we're going to
have to guide them.

406
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,544
CLAY:<i> Well, we went and got some</i>
<i>tree mail a while ago,</i>

407
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,381
<i>and it's got to be for food</i>
<i>or some easier way to get food.</i>

408
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,217
So it's something you really
want to win at this point.

409
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,301
I think would it be good
to distract the other team

410
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,554
-with my cleavage.
-(chuckles)

411
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,722
And if need be, it's easy
access, in case I have to

412
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,391
pull the boobs out to distract
the guys on the other side.

413
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,560
They're going to be blindfolded.

414
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,895
I need to-- They don't know.

415
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,613
PROBST:
How you guys doing?

416
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,322
(people murmur)

417
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,283
Okay, today's reward challenge

418
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,578
will require teamwork
and a lot of trust.

419
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,079
Each tribe is going to select

420
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,330
one tribe member
to be your guide.

421
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,583
They will be your eyes.

422
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,168
The other tribe members
will be blindfolded.

423
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,546
The blindfolded tribe members
will carry

424
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,715
the guide on the palanquins
behind you.

425
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,424
They'll navigate through

426
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,467
<i>a figure eight course,</i>

427
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,761
<i>led only by the guide's</i>
<i>verbal commands.</i>

428
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,431
<i>They'll be crossing</i>
<i>each other's paths three times.</i>

429
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,100
<i>Along the way</i>
<i>are several stations</i>

430
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,477
with bags in your tribe's colors
hanging from each one.

431
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,314
Untie all your colored bags,
get back to your mat first.

432
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,441
Want to know
what you're playing for?

433
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,609
-Yes.
-Definitely.

434
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,484
All right.

435
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,945
One extra lantern

436
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,573
and some items to help
keep your bellies full.

437
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,118
Fishing hooks, fishing line

438
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:06,622
and a huge
30-meter fishing net.

439
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,999
A much bigger net than the one
that came with your supplies.

440
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,958
Yes.

441
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,501
Sook Jai, because you have
one extra member,

442
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,255
you have to sit somebody out,
keeping in mind you cannot

443
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,965
sit out the same tribe member
in back-to-back challenges.

444
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,842
-Who you going to sit out?
-Stephanie.

445
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,969
Stephanie.
Now who are the guides?

446
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,346
Chuay Gahn.
You're going with Tanya.

447
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,473
How about you guys?

448
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,516
Penny. You two will be
the guides.

449
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,435
We'll get the rest of you
blindfolded and we'll go.

450
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:31,980
Survivors ready?

451
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,650
-Go! -Go straight,
go straight, go straight.

452
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,818
Brian, over to your left.

453
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,153
Left, left, left.

454
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,154
Straight, straight, straight.

00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:39,655
Clay, go left, go left.

456
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,033
Okay, stop, Chuay.

457
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,452
Stop, Jake.

458
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,205
-Are we there?
-Yeah, we're here.

459
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:48,497
Go, straight,
straight, straight.

460
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,457
Got it.

461
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,333
Go to the left.
Just stay straight.

462
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,627
Stay straight.

463
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,544
Straight, straight.

464
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,505
To the right, right.

465
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,507
Sharp right. Sharp right.

466
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,133
Right, right, right, right.

467
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,510
Stop, Clay, stop.

468
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,222
Hurry, y'all,
they're beating us.

469
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,306
Right, hard right.

470
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,517
Go. Walk fast.

471
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,352
Walk fast, y'all, walk fast.

472
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,520
Fast. Left, left, left!

473
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,064
Stop! Stop!

474
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,023
Back up a little, y'all.

475
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:15,857
Stop, stop.

476
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,735
To the right--
or the left just a tad.

477
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,362
Straight. Straight.

478
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,530
Straight.

479
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,824
All right, go straight.

480
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,158
Straight.

481
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,660
PROBST: Two Chuay Gahn,
two Sook Jai.

482
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,037
To the right.

483
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,373
Stop.

484
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,333
All right, I'm here.

485
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,085
Y'all, you're dropping me
forward.

486
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,421
PROBST: Very tight, guys,
very tight.

487
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,424
Okay, go, go,

Straight, go, go, go, go, go!

492

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,267
Straight, to the left.

494
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,019
-A little more.
-Stop, stop, stop.

495
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,562
Get it, get it, get it.

496
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,899
Okay, go. Straight.

497
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,027
One on the left,

498
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,069
Straight, straight.

499
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,237
Watch out.

500
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,530
Go right, go right!

501
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,865
Right. Straight.

Everybody go right,

Go right. Right.

Straight. Straight.

505
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,081
To the right just a touch.

506
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,124
Stop.

507
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,709
Oh! Damn!

508
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,461
Y'all can put it down
for just a second.

509
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,087
Just whammed me into that tree.

510
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:19,588
Sorry. Okay, go.

511
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,590
Pick up. Go left.

512
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,883
I'm in a tree.

513
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,301
-Pick it up.
-Go left! -Left!

514
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,011
Straight, stop, stop.

Go right, go right.

516
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,056
Go right.

517
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,891
Okay. Now go left.

518
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,809
Straight. Stop.

519
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,852
Let's go.

520
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,811
Hurry up.

521
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,812
Okay, okay, got it.

522
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,230
Go straight.

523
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,398
Little bit to the left.

524
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,108
Straight.

525
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,485
I got it.

526
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,527
I'm in a tree here.

527
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,779
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

528
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,530
No, you're not.
Pick up, pick up.

529
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,949
(all shouting)

530
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,950
PROBST:
Very tight still!

531
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,161
You guys are dead even!

532
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,287
Straight.

533
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,288
Y'all, we're almost there!

534
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,289
Right!

535
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:54,790
Okay.

536
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,458
Come on, come on!

537
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,793
We're almost there!
Get up.

538
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,460
Left. Brian, you're
going to get hurt.

539
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,962
-Oh!
-Come on, come on!

540
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,380
Left, everybody, left!

541
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,132
We're there! Go straight!
Go straight!

542
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,512
We're almost to the mat;
this is the last bag.

543
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,639
Pick up, go sharp right!

544
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,140
Right! Sharp right!

545
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,183
Go straight! We're there!

546
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,518
Go straight! Go straight!

547
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,812
To the right, to the right,
to the right!

548
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,021
To the right!

549
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,315
To the right, to the right,
to the right!

550
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,150
To the right!

551
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,318
Drop it! Yeah!

552
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,361
Sook Jai wins!

553
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,988
(cheering)

554
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,869
You're there.

555
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,995
Sook Jai, you earned it.

556
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,165
Lantern, buoys, fishing line,

557
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,668
fishing hooks
and a 30-meter huge fishing net.

558
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,795
We can fish, guys!

559
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,338
Happy hunting.

560
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,029
We need one, you guys.

561
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,490
We need a victory,
we need a V bad.

562
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,491
Yeah, oh, yeah.

563
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,534
We cannot let this defeat us.

564
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,536
We cannot lose morale.

565
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,746
I'm a Red Sox fan; I know
there's always tomorrow.

566
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,999
Yeah.

567
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,710
JAN:<i> Think we're all</i>
<i>a little bit drained.</i>

568
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,711
<i>We needed a morale booster.</i>

569
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,130
<i>We didn't get it,</i>

570
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,923
but we're going to get them,
we're going to get them.

571
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:34,055
That's all I can say.

572
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,390
HELEN:<i> I was feeling</i>
<i>paranoid all day</i>

573
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:39,186
<i>because I could tell they were</i>
<i>keeping me out of things</i>

574
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,521
<i>and deliberately, like,</i>
<i>going off without me.</i>

575
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,858
<i>I was getting</i>
<i>really nervous that maybe</i>

576
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,443
they were going to vote me off.

577
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,446
I can't believe how much trouble
you guys went to for this.

578
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,405
Oh, we didn't...

579
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,615
How the heck did you do this?

580
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,034
-Can we eat that?
-There you go.

581
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:54,701
-(applause)
-Yay, give it up for Helen!

582
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,912
(cheering)

583
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,079
HELEN:<i> You know, next to</i>
<i>spending it with my husband,</i>

584
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,415
<i>it was the nicest thing</i>
<i>anybody's ever done.</i>

585
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,126
<i>So, I'll remember that</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

586
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,545
And that's why it's hard
to vote people off.

587
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,839
How you going to vote people off
after they do that for you?

588
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,092
How is it, everybody?

589
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,385
It's delicious.

590
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,055
Doesn't taste like
it's done, Brian.

591
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,431
It's cooked all right.

592
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,641
-Really?
-Yeah.

593
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,725
How's it taste, okay, guys?

594
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,726
-Delicious.
-Yeah, okay.

595
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,145
-Good.
-Delicious. -It's fine.

596
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,730
Your stomach's still
a little touchy.

597
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,815
Just throw down one clam
and don't even...

598
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,108
Oh, God, I can't eat a clam.

599
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,818
Like a piece of gum.
Think of it like a piece of gum.

600
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,111
-No, I'll throw up.
-Yeah.

601
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,112
For real.

602
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,489
BRIAN:
<i>Tanya is having</i>

603
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,531
<i>a tough time right now</i>

604
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,950
<i>adjusting to</i>
<i>the survival element.</i>

605
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,743
We're trying to slowly
nurse her back to health.

606
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,495
She needs a lot of rest,
she needs some water

607
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,330
and a little bit of food--
she hasn't eaten much.

608
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,957
So I'm a little concerned
about her health.

609
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,750
Ever since I threw up
on that seafood,

610
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,126
it's making my stomach, like...

611
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,127
I know, she can't.

612
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,588
TANYA:
It associates it.

613
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,070
(flies buzzing)

614
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,822
CLAY:
Dang!

615
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,701
Look at them,
they're all over the beach!

616
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,536
My God.

617
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,997
Hey, y'all come check out
the squid on the beach!

618
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,291
Well, look at them
all up through here.

619
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:24,874
Look at there.

620
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,710
Isn't that squid?

621
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,752
You think they're edible?

622
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,837
Yeah, but only if they're dead.

623
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,755
-If we cook them?
-Smell that thing.

624
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,425
Huh. I know, I smell it.

625
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,093
That could be breakfast, guys,
just right here.

626
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,344
I say let's go ahead
and try some.

627
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,513
At least the tentacles;
these are safe right here.

628
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,806
-The tentacles are safe?
-Yeah.

629
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,143
HELEN:<i> This morning,</i>
<i>we found squid on the beach,</i>

630
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,687
<i>and, um, I have, once</i>
<i>in my life, bought squid</i>

631
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,855
<i>that wasn't cleaned,</i>

632
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,982
so I knew how to do it.

633
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,525
Dude, we want to try and take

634
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,402
that skin off, too.
See how we're getting these?

635
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,695
-Really?
-Yeah.

636
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,863
Like, that skin comes right off.
And I know

637
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,532
we got to get
every spot of ink off.

638
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,493
CLAY:<i> Helen-- everything's</i>
<i>serious, serious.</i>

639
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,203
I mean, there's no play to her.

640
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,164
<i>She's supposed to be</i>
<i>some kind of marine expert.</i>

641
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,915
<i>She's kind of got the</i>
<i>personality of an encyclopedia.</i>

642
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:06,875
<i>You open it up,</i>

643
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,294
there ain't nothing in there
fun to read.

644
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,171
You only open it
when you need information.

645
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,549
This does not cook long at all.

646
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,425
A minute or two?

647
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,760
No, I'm telling you,
it cooks quickly.

648
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,554
-But the longer
the better or...? -No.

649
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,432
Hell, I think that's got to
get cooked a little bit.

650
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,892
It might get more cooked,
but it's going to be rubber.

651
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,853
HELEN:
<i>I know how to cook squid.</i>

652
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,229
I don't care if we don't like it
right now

653
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,481
the taste isn't that good.

654
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,775
We've got to have food if we're
going to compete, you know.

655
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,406
-We got tree mail.
-Y'all ready?

656
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,866
Got tree mail. What does it say?

657
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,869
It says, "Petals on the ocean

658
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,455
"drifting out to sea,

659
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,917
"Keep your tribe together,
control your destiny,

660
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,420
"Life is like a flower,
so be the first to bloom,

661
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:56,925
Fail to work together,
face Tribal Council doom."

662
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:01,888
Sounds to me like kind of a
water deal and a swimming deal.

663
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,557
STEPHANIE:<i> I'm going to be</i>
<i>a little worried about me,</i>

664
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,602
<i>just because I'm still honestly</i>
<i>not feeling very well.</i>

665
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,605
I have to be able to do
something to show the tribe

666
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,315
that, you know,
I'm still in this.

667
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,282
PROBST:
Okay, guys.

668
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:21,783
Welcome to today's
immunity challenge.

669
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,119
First things first.

670
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,912
Sook Jai, give it up.

671
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,832
Immunity back up for grabs.

672
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,876
Today's immunity challenge
is pretty simple.

673
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,754
It's a floating
lotus flower puzzle.

674
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,424
Six pieces are missing
from that puzzle.

675
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,508
Those pieces have been tethered

676
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,551
to the bottom
of the ocean floor.

677
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,470
Your job: one tribe member
at a time, swim out,

678
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,808
dive down ten feet, unclip
the missing piece of the puzzle,

679
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,976
swim back and get it
in its spot.

680
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,938
Each piece is unique,
so it will only fit in one spot.

681
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,983
One person from each tribe
will stay on the flower

682
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,609
and they will help navigate

683
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,820
those pieces into
their appropriate spot.

684
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,697
First tribe back
with their puzzle completed

685
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,534
and everybody sitting back
on the flower wins immunity.

686
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:08,329
You can tag out and have
somebody else run a leg for you,

687
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,707
but you can only do so
after you have swum out,

688
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,001
touched the piece of puzzle
and made your way back.

689
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:13,960
Stephanie,
you sat out yesterday.

690
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,086
Who's sitting out today?

691
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,963
-Shii Ann.
-Shii Ann, you'll stay

692
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,965
back here with me. Everybody
else, swim out and take a spot.

693
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,301
Wait for my go.

694
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,805
Here we go, guys!

695
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,598
Immunity at stake!

696
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,683
-Survivors ready?
-Yeah. -Yeah.

697
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:29,851
Go!

698
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,061
Come on, Jed, let's go.

699
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,022
Let's go, Brian.

700
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,064
Get it, Jed.

701
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,108
Come on! You're doing great!

702
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,696
Let's go, let's go!

703
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,451
Come on, Jed.

704
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,495
All right!

705
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,330
You can do it, Jed!

706
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,372
Come on, baby.

707
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,373
Go, Brian, go!

708
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,168
(various team members
shouting encouragement

709
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,546
(cheering, whooping)

710
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,048
Sook Jai, go!

711
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,676
Get it on.

712
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,720
Chuay Gahn, go!

713
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:06,554
Go, go, go, go, go!

714
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,223
-Come on, Jake!
-Way to go, Jake!

715
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,349
It's on the front!

716
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,768
Come on, Papa Jake!

717
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,731
-(all shouting)
-Yeah, Jake!

718
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:17,732
Come on, Jake!

719
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,858
Helen, over here!

720
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,443
PROBST:
It's a tight race, guys.

721
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,569
You're both even.

722
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,863
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

723
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,198
Come on, Jake!

724
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,074
You can do it!

725
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,159
Sook Jai, go!

726
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,579
Go, Robb!

727
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,789
Come on, Helen.

728
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:33,748
Chuay Gahn, go!

729
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,672
Come on, Robb!

730
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,593
-Come on, Robb!
-Come on, baby, let's go!

731
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,470
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

732
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:47,971
PROBST:
Jan's having trouble.

733
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,138
Under the middle!

734
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,770
Come on, Jan.

735
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,650
-Come on, Robb!
-Over here, Jan!

736
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,485
(excited chattering)

737
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,574
PROBST:
Sook Jai, go!

738
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,159
Right here, Jan.

739
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,662
Come on, Jan! Good job!

740
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,914
PROBST:
Sook Jai has the lead.

741
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,125
Drop, Penny, come on!

742
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,635
PROBST:
Now Penny's in trouble.

743
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,596
Chuay Gahn, go!

744
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,974
I went past the purple one.

745
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,143
Three pieces missing each.

746
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,978
It's on the front!

747
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,821
PROBST:
Penny's given up.

748
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:47,113
She's coming to tag out.

749
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,454
Jed, got to touch, tag her. Go!

750
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,793
Go, baby, get there. Get that.

751
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,171
Over here, Ghandia, right here.

752
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,633
(teams shouting encouragement)

753
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,347
-Go, Ghandi!
-You got it!

754
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,348
Come on!

755
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,515
Ghandia, you got it!

756
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,767
You guys are very even.

757
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,267
(teams shouting)

758
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,226
Come on, Ghandia.

759
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,270
Come on, you got it!

760
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,773
Good job, honey.

761
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,399
Come on, you can do it.

762
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,151
Sook Jai, go!

763
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,662
Chuay Gahn, go!

764
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,587
Still anybody's race.

765
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,089
Two pieces left in each tribe.

766
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,592
-Yeah!
-Let's go, Erin!

767
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,886
Go! Yeah! Yeah!

768
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,222
Right here, baby.

769
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,266
You guys are very even still.

770
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,060
Stephanie, go.

771
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,562
The last piece.

772
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,190
Sook Jai has one piece left.

773
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,358
Chuay Gahn, go!

774
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,117
Chuay Gahn also
on their last piece.

775
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,079
It's very tight.

776
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,372
Stephanie and Clay.

777
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,377
(all shouting)

778
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,462
It's another tight race!

779
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,597
Sook Jai wins immunity!

780
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,891
(cheering)

781
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,774
You guys want it, come get it.

782
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,407
Well earned.

783
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,951
Yeah! Whoo!

784
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,202
Chuay Gahn, we have a date
tonight at Tribal Council,

785
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,831
where another member
will be voted out of the tribe.

786
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,197
Mm-mm-mm.

787
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,281
So close.

788
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,492
That's the beauty
of these games.

789
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,494
-Mm.
-There's no such thing

790
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,995
-as second place.
-Right.

791
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,497
You either win or you lose.

792
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,332
Right.

793
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,334
CLAY:<i> We lost again today</i>
<i>in the challenge.</i>

794
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,335
We didn't lose by very much.

795
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,713
We had a couple of
dumb, dumb, dumb,

796
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,839
dumb-ass mistakes,
matter of fact.

797
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,634
Janny, you couldn't find it,
is that what happened?

798
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,677
Yeah, I thought
it was on the end.

799
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,513
-I forgot it was in the middle.
-Oh.

800
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,850
So I kept going, so I missed--
lost valuable time.

801
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,392
I'm sorry, guys.

802
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,354
I tried to do the best.

803
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,523
BRIAN:<i> Janny, she just had</i>
<i>a little bit of hard time</i>

804
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,691
<i>finding the hook, and, uh,</i>

805
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,943
that really put us back.

806
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,322
HELEN:<i> I think the morale</i>
<i>is a little down today.</i>

807
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:20,535
<i>I think we're all trying to</i>
<i>keep each other's spirits up.</i>

808
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,537
I mean, now we know nobody's--
somebody's going home tonight.

809
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,621
You know, that's never good.

810
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,750
I want to vote
for Helen before Jan.

811
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,793
No.

812
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,335
She's getting on my nerves, yo.

813
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,546
But strength-wise...

814
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,506
That's the only reason.

815
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,716
I mean, everything is
a big deal.

816
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,176
Yeah.

817
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,345
"I am going to go over here
and I am going to pick up

818
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,347
this one leaf
and I'm going to bring it back."

819
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,682
(laughter)

820
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,183
GHANDIA:
<i>I'm not really sure</i>

821
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,893
<i>who I'm voting for tonight;</i>
<i>it's a tossup.</i>

822
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,396
<i>There's somebody who I want</i>
<i>to vote for because</i>

823
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,524
she's getting on my nerves,
which is Helen.

824
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,402
<i>And then there's somebody</i>
<i>who I don't necessarily want to</i>

825
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,405
<i>vote for, but I think she's</i>
<i>ready to go, which is Tanya.</i>

826
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:02,034
HELEN:<i> This is going to be</i>
<i>a terribly hard vote for me.</i>

827
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:02,535
Everybody loves Tanya.

828
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,537
We all love Tanya.

829
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,038
<i>That may play in her favor.</i>

830
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,665
<i>So I think</i>
<i>it's one of those nights</i>

831
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,291
where it could be anybody.

832
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,229
Well, it's never fun
coming to Tribal Council,

833
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,480
but two times in a row.

834
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,609
Ted, how is the morale
in this tribe?

835
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,486
Um, I think the morale
is slowly declining.

836
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,989
However, we're still
in high spirits.

837
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,908
And we're still a family.

838
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,950
Ghandia, is what Ted said true?

839
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,368
Is the morale
declining a little?

840
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,746
I think it might be
declining just a little bit

841
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,456
because our losses are so close

842
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,292
that I think that makes us
a little sad.

843
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,920
But, um, we just
keep believing that

844
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,297
when we do win
that it'll be a big win.

845
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,299
They think we're a wash,
and I think they've got

846
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,635
some days coming
where they're going to see

847
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:04,430
a whole lot of you here
instead of us.

848
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,974
Tanya, did you have any idea
it would be this tough

849
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:07,934
only six days in?

850
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,477
No, I had no idea
it would be this tough.

851
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,272
Been camping before
lots of times

852
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,316
and just didn't think
it would be this hard.

853
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,442
PROBST:
Who here will admit

854
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,111
that at least one point
in these first six days,

855
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,697
you have to assess how you're
fitting in with everyone else?

856
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,531
That is the object of this game.

857
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,325
You don't know
any of these people.

858
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,911
Helen, you're starting to nod.

859
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,996
Oh, yeah, I mean,
you'd have to be crazy

860
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,539
if you didn't think that way.

861
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,959
I-I wonder every day,
like, gee, you know,

862
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,085
I wonder if they like me.

863
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,503
I wonder if I said
the right thing.

864
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,504
Do they find me
too in control all the time?

865
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,340
I mean, they threw me

866
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,342
this wonderful anniversary party
the other night,

867
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:45,638
and I'll tell you, it was
all I could keep from doing

868
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,141
to not run into the back of the
cave and just absolutely cry.

869
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,519
I really tried
to hold it together,

870
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,396
but it was one of
the nicest things anybody's ever

871
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,940
done for me, so I was really...
I was touched.

872
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,859
Sounds like a beautiful moment.

873
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,361
Oh, don't even-- don't start.

874
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,571
'Cause I'm under orders
not to cry.

875
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,532
Why are you
under orders not to cry?

876
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,534
'Cause I work with
all these men, they're, like,

877
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,869
Green Berets and SEALs,

878
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,746
and they go,
"Okay, you can't cry."

879
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,665
I am totally un--
no, I'm not ki--

880
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,501
I can't go back there if I do,
because they'll give me

881
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:19,005
such a ration
for the next year, I-- no.

882
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,382
Ghandia, what are you
basing your vote on tonight?

883
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:26,387
I'm basing my vote on...

884
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,224
the person's ability
to actually mesh

885
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:30,891
with the rest of us.

886
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,686
I think that's really important.

887
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,606
There has to be a good
camaraderie amongst all of us.

888
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,401
Jan, how tough
will tonight's vote be?

889
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,111
It will be hard.

890
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,864
It's not one
I want to make, but, um,

891
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:50,202
it needs to be for the better
of the entire group.

892
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,579
It is time to vote.

893
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,248
Tanya, you're first.

894
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,607
Like an older brother would
to a younger sister,

895
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,567
got to take care of you,

896
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,070
got to make sure you get
a full meal tonight.

897
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,280
So, Tanya, need you
to get better, okay? Enjoy.

898
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,656
Talk to you soon.

899
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,511
I don't feel comfortable
with how you try

900
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,013
to keep your emotions in check.

901
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,474
And also, I just don't think

902
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,143
that you effectively
handle stress.

903
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,354
Seems like you kind of
get too anxious

904
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,564
and just start
bugging out, frankly.

905
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,900
I think, in the long run,
that's going to hurt the group.

906
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,629
I'll go tally the votes.

907
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,012
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

908
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,389
The person voted out will be

909
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,515
asked to leave the
Tribal Council area immediately.

910
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,852
I'll read the votes.

911
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,106
First vote.

912
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,275
Tanya.

913
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,736
Helen.

914
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,160
Two votes Helen, one vote Tanya.

915
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,040
Tanya.

916
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,375
Tennessee.

917
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,460
Two votes Tanya,
two votes Helen.

918
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,092
Tennessee.

919
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,554
Three votes Tanya,
two votes Helen.

920
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,393
Tanya. That's four.

921
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,187
That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

922
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,533
Tanya, the tribe has spoken.

923
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,495
Love you, Tanya.

924
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:54,428
You guys seem like a good,
strong, likable tribe.

925
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:57,431
The only way to start winning
is to keep that togetherness.

926
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:59,183
Head back to camp,
get some sleep.

927
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,700
<i>Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

928
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,915
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor...

929
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,793
The competition between Sook Jai
and Chuay Gahn heats up.

930
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,669
(grunting)

931
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,129
No, no, no! Foul!

932
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,589
<i>Will Chuay Gahn</i>
<i>make a comeback?</i>

933
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,966
Yeah!

934
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,592
Damn it!

935
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,094
PROBST:<i> And an incident</i>
<i>sends shock waves</i>

936
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:35,970
<i>through the Chuay Gahn camp.</i>

937
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,638
I didn't deny ...

938
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,516
(screaming)

939
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:49,149
Chuay Gahn, this has been
the opportunity of a lifetime.

940
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,778
It's been a great experience,
and it does change your life.

941
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,822
I learned that I take things
at home for granted.

942
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,866
And I'm not mad
at any of you for picking me.

943
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,661
And I just love
every one of you,

944
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,831
and I hope you bring it in
and win the million dollars.

945
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,707
I hope you have a great time.
