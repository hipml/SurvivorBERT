>> JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago,

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,237
these 18 Americans arrived in

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,697
Gabon, Africa.

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,032
Welcome to<i> Survivor: Gabon.</i>

8
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,534
They were surrounded by endless

9
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:38,037
savannah and miles of jungle.

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,080
Their every move was shadowed

11
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:43,084
by dangerous wild animals.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,295
They were as far away from

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,296
civilization as a person could

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,506
possibly be.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,299
>> I see why they call it the

16
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,260
Garden of Eden.

17
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,429
>> PROBST: Red tribe, you are

18
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,054
Fang.

19
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,139
On the first day, the 18 were

20
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,224
split into two tribes.

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,225
Yellow, you are Kota.

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,644
From the beginning, the yellow

23
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,729
tribe looked as though they

24
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,605
were going to run away with the

25
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,439
game.

26
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,859
Kota wins immunity and fire!

27
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:08,693
Kota wins reward!

28
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,862
(cheering)

29
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,113
Kota wins immunity once again!

30
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,699
They won nine out of the first

31
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,160
11 challenges.

32
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,328
Kota, should be a fun afternoon.

33
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,747
Fang, I got nothing for you.

34
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,748
>> It's hard, you know, when

35
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,916
you see them walking away.

36
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,417
They have everything and we

37
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:24,751
have nothing.

38
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,377
>> PROBST: Kota was well-fed,

39
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,088
well-rested, and confident.

40
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:29,672
>> The best part about this is

41
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,674
they may be completely out of

42
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,509
the race.

43
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,927
>> A tribe switch put the two

44
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,887
Fang leaders on Kota, but just

45
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,513
when Kenny and Crystal appeared

46
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,223
to be doomed, they struck back,

47
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,225
overcoming their opponents'

48
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,478
strength with superior strategy.

49
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,187
The original Kota never knew

50
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,022
what hit them.

51
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,816
They fell like dominoes.

52
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,234
To add insult to injury, the

53
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,527
powerful twosome tricked their

54
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,195
worst enemy into playing a fake

55
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,571
hidden immunity idol.

56
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,825
This is not a hidden immunity

57
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:57,492
idol.

58
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,993
(laughing)

59
00:01:59,077 --> 00:01:59,536
>> PROBST: When the fourth

60
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,704
consecutive Kota checked out,

61
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,332
it was a brand-new game.

62
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,291
Now there are only five players

63
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,167
left:

64
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,379
Susie, a teacher, hairdresser,

65
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,129
and mom.

66
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:10,713
>> Okay, I want to be honest

67
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,172
with you.

68
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,006
I was actually going to vote

69
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,507
you.

70
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,049
>> PROBST: A lot of her old

71
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:14,467
tribe mates thought she was a

72
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,176
bad strategist, but it was her

73
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,512
decision to flip that allowed

74
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,013
the original Fang to go on

75
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,891
their improbable run.

76
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,475
>> I might be riding coattails

77
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,103
here and there when I can, but

78
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:25,603
everybody's trying to do

79
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,396
everything they can to be that

80
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,147
sole Survivor.

81
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:28,857
>> PROBST: She's considered

82
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,400
weak at individual challenges,

83
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,359
yet she's already won a big one.

84
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,235
>> Yes!

85
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,988
>> PROBST: Susie wins immunity.

86
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,656
Matty, the personal trainer.

87
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,116
His physical strength was

88
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,242
supposed to carry him to the

89
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,077
end, but since the merge, he

90
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:41,494
hasn't won anything.

91
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,412
>> Matty is super-irritated.

92
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,956
You keep on winning challenges

93
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,582
and not him.

94
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,124
>> PROBST: He needs to win

95
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,584
immunity because he's still

96
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,002
considered to be a physical

97
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:49,711
threat.

98
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,628
>> If Fang takes the next

99
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,796
immunity challenge, they're

100
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,297
voting for me.

101
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,756
>> I'd say that's accurate.

102
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,841
>> PROBST: Sugar, the pin-up

103
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,675
model.

104
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,885
She's quick to tell everyone

105
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:57,886
she doesn't know how to play

106
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,386
the game.

107
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,637
>> Yeah, I'm an idiot.

108
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,930
Ding, ding, ding...

109
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:01,723
>> PROBST: She's been sent to

110
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,265
Exile Island five times in a

111
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,725
row.

112
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,642
>> I'm here to break records,

113
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:04,934
you know?

114
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,935
>> PROBST: So she's spent the

115
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,936
least least amount of time with

116
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,354
the others, but she's figured

117
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,607
out how to become the vital

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,941
swing vote in several

119
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,318
game-changing moments.

120
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,611
>> I think I'm the lady of the

121
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,612
hour.

122
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,280
>> PROBST: Bob, the 57-year-old

high school physics teacher, the

124
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,617
last of the old Kota tribe.

125
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,285
>> The next one to go is Bob,

126
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,786
so Bob should be worried.

127
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,787
>> PROBST: Bob has just won

128
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,580
reward!

129
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,664
He would have been voted out

130
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,415
a long time ago if he hadn't

131
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,417
gone on an amazing winning

132
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,543
streak.

133
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,461
Bob scores!

134
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,588
Bob wins immunity!

135
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,881
>> Four challenges in a row.

136
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,382
I'm 57 years old.

137
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,509
AARP is going to call up and ask

138
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,011
me to represent them.

139

professional video game player.

141
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,265
If anyone can be called a

142
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,558
Survivor, it's him.

143
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,560
He's already survived 11 trips

since day one out here,

147
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:50,980
you know.

148
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,273
I am the mastermind.

149
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,900
>> PROBST: He'll say anything

150
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,318
to win and has no problem lying.

151
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,528
>> Kenny acts like he's this

152
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,989
weak, little meager guy, and he

153
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:00,490
spins all these lies.

Bob because Bob promised to

give him the immunity necklace.

157
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,915

>> PROBST: And Kenny immediately

159
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,210
tried to stab Bob in the back.

160

163
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,634
and the deal was off.

real hidden immunity idol for

the last 28 days, finally

171
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,852
decided to play it...

...not to protect herself,

173
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,857

Bob kept his immunity necklace

194
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,787
It's crazy.

195
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,456
I wasn't expecting that.

196
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,375
>> Handing over the immunity

197
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,336
necklace felt glorious.

198
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,671
I had to send Crystal home, and

199
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,007
I had that damn idol since the

200
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,717
first 24 hours at Exile, and I

201
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,927
didn't use it to the very end

202
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,303
and I used it to save Matty.

203
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,471
I like, literally, have never

204
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,849
felt so powerful in my life.

205
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,396
>> You know, in the woods

206
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,856
somewhere, here and there.

207
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,565
You know how it goes around

208
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,944
here, Kenny.

209
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,326
>> Why don't you get your own

210
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,745
idol?

211
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,788
>> I was out of the loop

212
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,539
tonight and I do feel a little

213
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,582
bit betrayed.

214
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,458
So, tonight at Tribal Council, I

215
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,086
called out Bob about the hidden

216
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,796
immunity necklace and he made up

217
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,673
a lie saying that if he thinks

218
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,341
that I'm going, that he'd give

219
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,051
it to me and that wasn't part of

220
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:07,718
the deal.

221
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,804
He's not a man of his word now.

222
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,888
You know, it's not like I don't

223
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,265
try to get my own idol.

224
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,599
I was pretty close today.

225
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,643
>> We'll see.

226
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,562
By announcing this whole deal

227
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,479
in front of everybody, I think

228
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,315
he was sort of trying to

229
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,068
embarrass me if I didn't stand

230
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,361
by my word.

231
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,612
For me, it's a little bit on the

232
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,197
annoying side.

233
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,160
That means all promises are off.

234
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,578
>> Congratulations again, Bob.

235
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,371
>> Oh, thanks.

236
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,290
>> You get a lot of respect from

237
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:37,874
everybody, man.

238
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,082
>> Yeah.

239
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,250
>> That means you're playing a

240
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,086
really, really good game, dude.

241
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,683
>> So, Kenny thinks we're in an

242
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,394
alliance from before, and she

243
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,937
still thinks that Matty's in an

244
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:00,229
alliance.

245
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,398
These guys don't know anything.

246
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,691
So I guess I'm just going to

247
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,734
keep playing like I'm with

248
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,568
Kenny.

249
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,528
He's going to keep playing

250
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,405
like he's with her, and we take

251
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:09,739
them all out.

252
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,409
Is that cool with you?

253
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,536
>> I would love to be in the

254
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,038
final three with Bob and Matty.

255
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,582
So that means the next two

256
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,875
people I would like to vote out

257
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,585
would be Sue and Kenny.

258
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,962
But when I knocked Crystal out

259
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,173
last night, it made Kenny maybe

260
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,299
not trust me so much.

261
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,134
So I'm going to make sure that

262
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,385
he feels safe as soon as

263
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,179
possible before he gets to Bob

264
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:33,804
or convinces Matty of something

265
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,183
and starts messing up my plan.

266
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,275
>> Yeah.

267
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:53,366
Yeah.

268
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,666
>> Cool!

269
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,291
>> Oh, my God.

270
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,417
I want this one.

271
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,419
Cool clothes or cloths or

272
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,003
something.

273
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,712
>> These are clothes.

274
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,880
>> Oh, my God.

275
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,215
I'm calling the blue one right

276
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:09,799
now.

277
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,883
>> Last night, I felt I got

278
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,302
blindsided and I felt a little

279
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,637
betrayal from Sugar.

280
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,347
But Sugar and I went on a walk

281
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,391
today and I feel comfortable

282
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:18,808
now.

283
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,351
I feel that Sugar has no

284
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,104
alliance to Susie, so I think

285
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,272
that Sugar really wants to take

286
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,273
me to the final three with her.

287
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,440
>> I mean, either way, Susie's

288
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:26,774
gone.

289
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,233
>> Susie's going home.

290
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,150
>> Yeah.

291
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,193
>> This is not another

292
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,111
blindside on me, right?

293
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,028
>> No!

294
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:31,862
>> Okay.

295
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,866
(laughing)

296
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,617
>> "A tribe of many colors,

297
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,911
red, yellow, white, black, and

298
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,412
blue.

299
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,746
Each of you, unique.

300
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,373
Like warriors when you're

301
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,624
through, an amazing chance

302
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,750
you've got,

303
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,294
an amazing trip you're on,

304
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:46,836
an amazing shot at a million

305
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,046
bucks if you conquer

306
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,966
amazing Gabon."

307
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,262
>> It's day 37, final five.

308
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,054
Feels great to be here.

309
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:57,763
I didn't think I was going to

310
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,348
make it this far, but we're

311
00:09:59,432 --> 00:09:59,515
here.

312
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:00,641
We got a challenge coming up.

313
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,101
So, we have to kind of make our

314
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,102
own.

315
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:03,686
We got face paint, and some

316
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,646
material and beads and we have

317
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,273
to each uniquely dress ourselves

318
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,483
up as warriors, so I'm pumped

319
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,985
about that.

320
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:11,819
I am really proud of myself that

321
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,863
I've gotten this far, and I'm

322
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,864
still going to keep trying.

323
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,240
I wanted to get to the million

324
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:16,490
dollars.

325
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,577
That's my goal: got to win it.

326
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:41,057
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

327
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,809
Wow, I am impressed.

328
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,269
You guys look good.

329
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,228
>> Thank you.

330
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,104
>> Thank you, Jeff.

331
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,564
Matty, was it fun getting a

332
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,066
chance to create a new

333
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,983
character?

334
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:51,942
>> Yeah, it's fun.

335
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,569
I just hope my family and my

336
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:54,195
girlfriend still love me when I

337
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:54,779
get home after this.

338
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,655
I hope they don't think I lost

339
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,323
my mind.

340
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:57,948
>> PROBST: I think the person

341
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:58,908
who is going to take the most

342
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,870
grief is Bob.

343
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,872
Very Village People.

344
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,790
You guys ready to get to

345
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,749
today's immunity challenge?

346
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,541
>> Yes.

347
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,167
>> PROBST: First things first.

348
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,335
Bob, once again, I will take it

349
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,380
back from you.

350
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,091
Thank you.

351
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,595
Once again, immunity is back up

352
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,513
for grabs.

353
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,972
For today's challenge, you will

354
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,808
dig under a wall, make your way

355
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:28,687
across a series of planks...

356
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,232
which will lead you into a maze

357
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:35,111
filled with Gabonese huts.

358
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,738
Inside three of the huts, you

359
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,241
will find bags of puzzle pieces.

360
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,326
Each time you find a bag, you

361
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,411
must make your way through the

362
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,746
maze, to the finish platform,

363
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,415
drop the bag, and then head out

364
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,624
to find another one.

365
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,917
Once you've collected all three

366
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,876
bags of puzzle pieces, you will

367
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,337
use those pieces to build a

368
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,756
replica of a Gabonese hut.

369
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,049
First person to build it

370
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,219
correctly wins immunity,

371
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,013
is guaranteed a one-in-four shot

372
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,099
at winning a million bucks.

373
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,934
All right, we'll get started.

374
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,270
This way.

375
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,941
Here we go, for immunity and a

376
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,860
guaranteed spot in the final

377
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,652
four.

378
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:16,986
Survivors ready?

379
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,114
Go!

380
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,536
First step is to dig a hole big

381
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,787
enough to get you underneath

382
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,081
that wall.

383
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,666
Once you think that hole is big

384
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,376
enough, pull your body through,

385
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,379
and you're on to the next phase.

386
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,214
Bob is stuck halfway.

387
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:37,923
Kenny trying to pull himself

388
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,883
through.

389
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:43,971
Susie going to give it a shot.

390
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:44,889
Susie is the first through, out

391
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,515
of nowhere.

392
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,183
Susie working her way on to the

393
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,226
planks.

394
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,895
Kenny's now through.

395
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,355
Bob is now through.

396
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,274
Matty's now through.

397
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,942
Sugar squeezing that booty

398
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:57,401
through.

399
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,152
(Sugar laughs)

400
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,153
Sugar's through now.

401
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,572
Everybody is now through.

402
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,033
This is an elevated maze.

403
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,035
Your goal is to figure your way

404
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,912
out along these planks to get

405
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,039
to the finish, which will lead

406
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,916
you into the maze of Gabonese

407
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,042
huts.

408
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,380
Bit of a guessing game.

409
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,550
A lot of forward thinking.

410
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,593
Matty falls off.

411
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,177
He's got to head all the way

412
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,971
back to the start.

413
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,434
Kenny almost falls off.

414
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,228
Nice save.

415
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,896
Susie thinks she has it.

416
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,022
Sugar following along.

417
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,274
Kenny following.

418
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:37,900
Susie can see the end.

419
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,944
Susie's through.

420
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,320
Sugar is through.

421
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:45,115
Kenny is through.

422
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,742
You have to untie a series of

423
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,952
knots to open a gate.

424
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,748
Sugar is first through.

425
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,333
Susie's through.

426
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,709
Matty can see the end.

427
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,252
Matty trying to get back in

428
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,462
this.

429
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,715
Matty's now across the planks.

430
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,801
Bob is now through his gate.

431
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,011
Kenny's now out on the maze.

432
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,098
Matty's out in the maze.

433
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,975
Everybody is now out in the

434
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,309
maze of Gabonese huts.

435
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,229
Everybody is looking for pieces.

436
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,147
There are 25 huts.

437
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,233
Only three of them have puzzle

438
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,986
pieces in them.

439
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,655
Once you find a bag, you got to

440
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,739
make your way all the way to

441
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,284
the finish.

442
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,827
Matty is the first one to the

443
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,036
top with his first bag of

444
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,496
puzzle pieces.

445
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,748
Kenny back with his first bag.

446
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,375
Susie right behind with her

447
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,084
first bag.

448
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,587
Bob and Sugar heading back with

449
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,879
their first bag of puzzle

450
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,382
pieces.

451
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,564
>> PROBST: Matty back with his

452
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,774
second bag of puzzle pieces.

453
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,234
Matty heads out looking for

454
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,612
that third and final bag.

455
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,916
Bob pulling himself up this

456
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,251
steep finish with that second

457
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,085
bag of puzzle pieces.

458
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,258
Sugar has her final bag of

459
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,802
puzzle pieces.

460
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,308
Bob has his final bag.

461
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,688
Sugar back with her final bag

462
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,523
of puzzle pieces.

463
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,066
Drop the bag, open them,

464
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,027
start working on the puzzle.

465
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,907
Bob is back with his final bag

466
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,408
of puzzle pieces.

467
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,910
Sugar and Bob now working on

468
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,202
the puzzle.

469
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,079
Matty trying to get in on it.

470
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,248
Kenny trying to get in on it.

471
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,084
Susie cannot find her last bag.

472
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,503
Win this challenge, you are

473
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,962
guaranteed a spot in the final

474
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:04,713
four.

475
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,297
Lose, you could be going home

476
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,966
tonight.

477
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,679
Bob making quick work of this

478
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,013
puzzle.

479
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,431
Kenny working to catch up.

480
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,142
Matty working to catch up.

481
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,522
Sugar looking very good.

482
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,357
Bob making a lot of progress.

483
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,609
He's close.

484
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,318
It's Sugar and Bob.

485
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,993
Bob wins immunity!

486
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,370
Five straight challenges!

487
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,000
>> Where's Susie?

488
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,593
>> PROBST: Bob, come on over.

489
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,055
>> Thank you, Jeff.

490
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,849
>> PROBST: For the third

491
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:57,391
straight time, individual

492
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,017
immunity.

493
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,269
You are safe once again at

494
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,562
Tribal Council.

495
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,690
Kenny, Matty, Sugar, Susie,

496
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,651
tonight, after 37 hard-fought

497
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,778
days, one of you going home.

498
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,738
Grab your stuff, head back to

499
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:10,946
camp.

500
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,447
I will see you at Tribal

501
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,574
Council.

502
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,287
>> My goal, obviously, was for

503
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,204
me to win, but that didn't

504
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,122
happen.

505
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,207
Bob, the wizard, fantastic Bob

506
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,292
won.

507
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,543
I don't know how you beat that

508
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,129
guy.

509
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,868
>> I set myself up so well in

510
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,036
this game right now that I

511
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,661
could just chill and relax all

512
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,454
day.

513
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,414
And, uh, I already confirmed it,

514
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,583
uh, today, uh, with Sugar during

515
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,503
our walk that, uh, if Bob wins,

516
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,254
then, uh, it's Susie that's

517
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,130
going to go first.

518
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,715
So I'm not worried.

519
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,550
>> Hey.

520
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,512
I think, uh, S-Sugar is going to

521
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,930
tell Susie that we're voting for

522
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:18,430
her.

523
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:18,680
>> Mm-hmm.

524
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,140
>> But we're going to wait

525
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,433
till the day's almost over, so

526
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,142
she doesn't start scrambling

527
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,311
around.

528
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,856
You realize I still haven't

529
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,525
written your name down, dude.

530
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,652
I'm not the type of person that

531
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,069
would blindside you.

532
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,153
If I was going to write your

533
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:33,654
name down, I'd tell you.

534
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,988
>> Yeah.

535
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,614
>> Okay?

536
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,824
>> I really want to go to the

537
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:36,990
end.

538
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,242
>> We're there.

539
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,828
Don't worry about it, bro.

540
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,163
>> Is Kenny working you?

541
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:43,539
Is he trying to...

542
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,957
What's he doing?

543
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,084
>> Not really.

544
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,254
>> Is that what we're doing,

545
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:50,754
is Kenny?

546
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,713
I don't know; you guys won't

547
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,172
tell me anything.

548
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,173
>> We don't... I'm not saying

549
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:53,757
anything 'cause I don't know,

550
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,883
Susie.

551
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:55,759
>> You still don't know?

552
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,761
>> I still don't know.

553
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,680
>> Usually, I know what's going

554
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,848
on because Matty will say

555
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,807
something to me.

556
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,267
But no one has talked to me,

557
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,644
so I-I feel a bit vulnerable.

558
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,478
Like, is it me?

559
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,479
I really don't know what I'm

560
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,355
doing now because nobody's

561
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,022
talking to me.

562
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,315
I hate that.

563
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,942
>> Do what you feel.

564
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,068
>> Yeah, but in this game, you

565
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,361
still have to try to get to the

566
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,028
top.

567
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:15,571
Still your goal is to try to

568
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,990
still be aligned and trust

569
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,157
people to get you to at least

570
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,993
the three, or at least the four.

571
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:21,577
>> Well, everybody's playing

572
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,995
for themselves tonight.

573
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,246
There's no way to trust anybody.

574
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,747
If you listen to yourself,

575
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,457
I think you'll be fine.

576
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,667
>> I had a little bit of a

577
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,918
heart-to-heart with Matty.

578
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,878
Anyway, and he's like, "Yeah,

579
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,004
just go with your gut."

580
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:32,921
You want to believe people are

581
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,839
telling you the truth, but, you

582
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,090
know, sometimes they're lying.

583
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:35,924
Sometimes they are telling

584
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:36,508
you the truth.

585
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,718
It's just when to know when to

586
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,136
believe it.

587
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,345
But I definitely feel nervous

588
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,390
that I could go tonight.

589
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:49,521
>> You and, you and me are

590
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,982
staying close to the end,

591
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,525
no matter what, no matter what,

592
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,318
you and I, you and I, no matter

593
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,986
what.

594
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,155
>> I know.

595
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:02,576
>> The final result in this

596
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,620
game should be you, me, and

597
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,746
Kenny.

598
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,712
>> For sure.

599
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,130
>> Me and Matty have an

600
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,174
understanding that Susie goes

601
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,091
next.

602
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,719
But Kenny is very smart, and,

603
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,597
um, he is dangerous to-to keep

604
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,097
around.

605
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,058
It seems like the further along

606
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:26,516
we are, the harder the

607
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,354
decisions get to as to who we

608
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,898
vote out.

609
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,950
I still don't know what I'm

610
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:43,742
going to do.

611
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,035
To get rid of Susie would be

612
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,161
great because I have no

613
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,829
allegiance with Susie, and I

614
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,830
don't trust her.

615
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,332
I would vote for Kenny because

616
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,542
he's a liar, and he could

617
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,836
manipulate Bob or Matty.

618
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,047
So I just have to think really

619
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,216
hard about what should be done.

620
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,259
No matter what I decide to do,

621
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,970
I think Bob and Matty will vote

622
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,471
with me.

623
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,780
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

624
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,783
the members of our jury.

625
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,832
Marcus, Charlie, Randy,

626
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,543
Corinne, and Crystal, voted out

627
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,962
at the last Tribal Council.

628
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,425
Bob, let's start with you.

629
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,386
Five consecutive wins.

630
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,014
Tied for a record in the history

631
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,223
of this game.

632
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,975
Do you feel the target on your

633
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,435
back getting larger and larger

634
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,811
with each win?

635
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,062
>> Yes.

636
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,605
That's why I keep working

637
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,982
harder and harder, trying to

638
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,150
make sure I have this necklace

639
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,568
on when I come here.

640
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,068
>> PROBST: Matty, as a

641
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,862
competitor, there has to be a

642
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,363
part of you that looks at Bob

643
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,198
with some admiration.

644
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,658
>> Yeah, Bob's money, man.

645
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,576
He's an expert at these

646
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:07,868
challenges.

647
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,494
And I don't know how he does it,

648
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,829
but there's not even a target on

649
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,747
his back 'cause we can't even

650
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,206
see him he's so far ahead of us,

651
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:13,707
you know.

652
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,918
The guy is just good.

653
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,003
>> PROBST: Kenny, it's got to

654
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:18,503
be a little frustrating.

655
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,089
>> The thing is about Bob and I,

656
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:21,590
we come from two different

657
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,133
backgrounds.

658
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,217
I mean, I'm a gamer.

659
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,469
I usually sit in front of TV

660
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,054
and play video games all day.

661
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,764
I don't do outdoorsy things.

662
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,015
While, you know, he's an

663
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,433
outdoorsy type of, type of guy.

664
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:31,767
He goes camping.

665
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,435
He does fishing.

666
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,645
And you know what?

667
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,396
That's how it is.

668
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,523
>> PROBST: Susie, you don't

669
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,192
want anybody to have any reason

670
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,068
to vote you out.

671
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,611
Are you a little concerned that

672
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,155
37 days in this game might give

673
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:45,781
people a reason to want to get

674
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,199
rid of you?

675
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,241
>> I want to feel comfortable,

676
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,367
but I'm not completely

677
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,327
comfortable all the time.

678
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,204
So I wait till somebody comes

679
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:52,788
to me and tells me something,

680
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,040
and it can work against me,

681
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:55,624
and it can work for me, also.

682
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,000
So...

683
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:57,793
>> PROBST: How does it work

684
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,543
against you?

685
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,045
>> Because I'm not

686
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,963
strategically making moves and

687
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:02,881
trying to talk to people and

688
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:03,924
asking questions and finding

689
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,008
out what's going on.

690
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:05,634
So that's what makes me feel a

691
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,512
little bit like an outsider.

692
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,971
>> PROBST: Kenny, do you feel,

693
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:10,639
coming into tonight's Tribal

694
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,974
that you've repaired any damage

695
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,517
you might have done over the

696
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,601
last 37 days?

697
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,270
>> I feel like I've repaired a

698
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:17,938
lot of damage.

699
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,189
I've made up with a lot of

700
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,941
people, and I feel like our

701
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:21,483
bonds are stronger that way.

702
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,485
>> PROBST: At the last Tribal

703
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,653
Council, there was some

704
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,655
discussion about a deal you had

705
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,615
made with Bob, that if he had

706
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,991
the necklace and felt you

707
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,034
needed it, he would give it to

708
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:31,201
you.

709
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,494
Did that come up today?

710
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,871
>> I really feel that Bob is

711
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,206
actually going to back down on

712
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,125
his deal because the deal was

713
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:38,625
that if he won the next

714
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,669
challenge, he'd give it to me.

715
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,254
And then he said, "Only if I

716
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,130
think you're going."

717
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:43,755
Apparently there was some small

718
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,215
print at the bottom of the

719
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,424
contract that you had to look

720
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,342
at through the magnifying glass

721
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,677
to see so I think that he's

722
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,970
pulling some loopholes around

723
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,179
the deal and trying to back out

724
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,139
of it somehow.

725
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,431
>> Well, what I didn't realize

726
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,225
was he went back to the tribe

727
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,685
and discussed with people that

728
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,437
when I gave him the necklace,

729
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,522
that they would then blindside

730
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:00,689
me.

731
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,357
I was trying to take care of

732
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,067
him and he was going to take

733
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,193
advantage of me.

734
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,071
That changed things quite

735
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:08,947
dramatically.

736
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,365
That was the small print in the

737
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:10,866
bottom of the contract you

738
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,326
forgot to read that if I help

739
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,870
you, you help me, not if I help

740
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,581
you, you stab me in the back.

741
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,500
>> PROBST: So, Kenny, did you

742
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,127
get caught trying to work a

743
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:22,544
deal?

744
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,504
>> Not really because if I felt

745
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,964
like I was going to go that

746
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,632
night, he'd give me the idol,

747
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,176
and of course who else are they

748
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,218
going to vote for but Bob?

749
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,970
It's not called a blindside.

750
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,346
It's called saving me if I feel

751
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,264
like I'm going.

752
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,391
(laughter)

753
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,517
>> Oh.

754
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,143
>> PROBST: So, Kenny, you don't

755
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,978
see any problem with taking it

756
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:40,604
and then him being vulnerable

757
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,105
and going home.

758
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:42,814
That's just the way the game

759
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,440
goes?

760
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,065
>> Yeah, that's what he said.

761
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,650
He said he's sacrifice his life

762
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,527
for me if that was the case.

763
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,737
That was the deal.

764
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,197
>> PROBST: Do you really feel

765
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,114
like you need the necklace

766
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,532
tonight or do you just want him

767
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,075
to uphold what you think was the

768
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,659
deal?

769
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,994
>> I feel that I'm safe

770
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,205
tonight, but I still that say we

771
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,581
had a deal and he's not living

772
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,750
up to it.

773
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,375
>> PROBST: All right, it's time

774
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:02,792
to get to the vote.

775
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,753
Bob, you do have individual

776
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,378
immunity.

777
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,713
The necklace is always yours to

778
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,131
keep or give to somebody else.

779
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,758
>> I think I'll keep it again.

780
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,092
>> PROBST: All right, you

781
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:11,885
cannot vote for Bob.

782
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,511
Everybody else is fair game.

783
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,638
Susie, you're up.

784
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:24,940
>> I don't know if this is

785
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:25,857
really going to be a blindside

786
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,107
or not.

787
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:26,775
It could be me going home.

788
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,653
I guess we'll see.

789
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,551
>> Susie, I'm really proud that

790
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,552
you got this far.

791
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,679
I hope you the best.

792
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,310
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

793
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,437
votes.

794
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:14,656
Once the votes are read,

795
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,574
the decision is final.

796
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,158
The person voted out will be

797
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,368
asked to leave the Tribal

798
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:18,910
Council area immediately.

799
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,913
I'll read the votes.

800
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,543
First vote: Kenny.

801
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,048
Susie.

802
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,175
One vote Kenny; one vote Susie.

803
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,847
Kenny.

804
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,974
Two votes Kenny; one vote Susie.

805
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,522
14th person voted out and the

806
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,648
sixth member of our jury: Kenny.

807
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,191
That's three.

808
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:50,775
That's enough.

809
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,902
You need to bring me your torch.

810
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,705
Kenny, the tribe has spoken.

811
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,373
>> Have fun.

812
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,500
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.

813
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,051
Another blindside and now we

814
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,802
are down to four.

815
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,554
The end is near,

816
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,848
the game, far from over.

817
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,099
Grab your torches.

818
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:23,767
Head back to camp.

819
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,894
Good night.

820
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,820
>> Definitely game over for

821
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,571
Kenny.

822
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,615
And just like in a video game,

823
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,824
sometimes it doesn't go your

824
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,659
way and you lose.

825
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,286
I thought I did extremely well

826
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:43,787
in this game.

827
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,913
I was playing a lot of people

828
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,039
and in the end I got played

829
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:46,915
myself and I hope for them the

830
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,707
best.

831
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,419
They got me good.

832
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,538
>> Yeah.

833
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,122
Because it's a reality check.

834
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,457
This is it.

835
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,750
It's all going to depend on who

836
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,668
wins today.

837
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,627
>> This is the last thing you

838
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,795
can do to change your fate,

839
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,339
basically, the last challenge.

840
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,007
>> Today's day 38 and it's huge.

841
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,217
We'll probably have to do an

842
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,302
immunity challenge today, so the

843
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,011
only way I'm going to be able

844
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:42,929
to save my butt today is I have

845
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:43,638
to win.

846
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,931
It's almost a given that Bob

847
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,598
will win.

848
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,141
Bob is the wizard and he's

849
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,767
capable of pretty much of

850
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,228
anything.

851
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,940
>> Oh, if I win, I'd vote Bob

852
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,066
off.

853
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,359
It's crazy how Bob's winning

854
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:56,651
like that.

855
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:57,110
Just boom, boom, boom.

856
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,446
If I don't win, I know I'm

857
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,113
toast.

858
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,157
I'm just nervous because today

859
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,450
is going to seal our fate and I

860
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,075
look at Bob and Sugar, and I can

861
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,827
see their confidence.

862
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,079
It isn't just luck.

863
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:08,830
He's pretty skilled.

864
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,458
But there's always a chance that

865
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,876
myself or Matty could pull it.

866
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,960
It may be slim, but I still

867
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:14,335
have a shot at it.

868
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,962
But if I don't win, I really

869
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,881
feel strongly that I will be

870
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,425
the one going home.

871
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,513
>> Hey, Sue, go get them.

872
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:30,268
>> Matty went to get tree mail.

873
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:30,810
>> Here we go.

874
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,938
"Congratulations, final four.

875
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,149
You have done what 14 of your

876
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,358
fellow tribesmen and women

877
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,109
could not.

878
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,444
Today you will honor their

879
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,153
memories.

880
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,029
Go to Exile Island.

881
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,072
There you will find the torches

882
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,449
of your fallen comrades.

883
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,242
At each torch, you will collect

884
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,827
a tribal mask of those who were

885
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,995
voted out before you.

886
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,039
Take them all to the highest

887
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,832
plateau in savannah and burn

888
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,876
them in their honor, as they

889
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,877
each had a part in getting you

890
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,211
to this point.

891
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,630
You will then proceed to your

892
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,592
final immunity challenge."

893
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,219
To be able to pay my respects

894
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:04,928
to the 14 that went before me

895
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,514
is huge for me.

896
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,598
They were all quality human

897
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,517
beings, quality competitors.

898
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,018
They definitely deserve

899
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,978
respect, and I'm just honored

900
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,941
to be a part of it.

901
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,609
>> Michelle.

902
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,276
>> Very first challenge,

903
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,778
Michelle shocked me.

904
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,779
She did pretty well.

905
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,405
I can't believe the way she

906
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,240
performed.

907
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,200
I wish her the best.

908
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,535
>> This whole experience is

909
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,662
way, way harder than I thought

910
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,454
it would be.

911
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,580
Actually being there and

912
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,707
shivering cold, I was surprised

913
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,084
that I couldn't, like, mentally

914
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,088
overcome that.

915
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,589
>> Gillian.

916
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,465
>> Good old Gillian.

917
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,508
>> I have nothing but good

918
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,509
things to say about her.

919
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,720
She was really fun.

920
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,472
>> What I learned about myself

921
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,307
is that I couldn't compromise

922
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:51,975
myself in order to fit in

923
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,434
better.

924
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,269
When you're happy, you're

925
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,396
lucky, and you should be happy

926
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,981
that you are lucky in life.

927
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:04,779
And I'll never lose that.

928
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,613
>> Paloma.

929
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,656
>> Nice girl.

930
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,199
Just as sweet as could be.

931
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,617
Really bright.

932
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,119
>><i> Survivor</i> has meant a lot

933
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:11,452
to me, you know?

934
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,829
It changed me.

935
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,454
It challenged me in ways that I

936
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,664
thought I never could be

937
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,373
challenged.

938
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,999
I didn't make it the 39 days,

939
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,376
but at the same time, there is

940
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,127
nothing in this world that can

941
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,337
be thrown at me that I can't

942
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,881
conquer.

943
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,135
>> Jacquie.

944
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:27,927
>> Jacquie.

945
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,971
>> She's such a nice kid,

946
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,598
always smiling, always helpful.

947
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,140
She should have lasted a lot

948
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,475
longer.

949
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,894
>> I would sum up<i> Survivor</i> as

950
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,271
probably the best experience of

951
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:38,479
my life.

952
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,481
I think this game definitely

953
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,107
changed me.

954
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,984
I really appreciated being out

955
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:43,985
there and having that adventure

956
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,945
and I want to continue that in

957
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,113
my entire life.

958
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:50,658
I want to live that freely.

959
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,285
>> GC.

960
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,077
>> Oh, my God.

961
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,120
>> That kid was classic.

962
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,706
G-Sizzle.

963
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,541
He had a life of suffering and

964
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,709
he said he just didn't want to

965
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,543
suffer anymore.

966
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,713
>> By being volunteered by my

967
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,131
entire tribe to be the leader

968
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,841
was a very important thing to

969
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:07,383
me.

970
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,093
But I never expected it to be as

971
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,345
difficult as it was.

972
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,680
It definitely changed my life

973
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,765
in 15 days.

974
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,265
Like, I feel that I'm a

975
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,976
stronger person and I know who

976
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,936
I am even more than I did

977
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,063
before I came.

978
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,233
>> Kelly.

979
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,068
>> Kelly.

980
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,361
I think Kelly did pretty well

981
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,904
in this game, considering her

982
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,072
odds.

983
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,157
She-She made it pretty far.

984
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,701
>> This game has taught me so

985
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,370
much and it made me appreciate

986
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,037
everything, starting from home

987
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,164
and my parents and my life in

988
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:38,915
general.

989
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:39,624
And I think it's going to be

990
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:40,708
with me the rest of my life,

991
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,671
always.

992
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,588
>> Ace.

993
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,839
>> Ace.

994
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,217
>> Wow.

995
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,052
>> I feel terrible about Ace

996
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,929
because I took him out, and I

997
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,263
think I took him out too soon

998
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,599
because someone may have lied

999
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,308
to me.

1000
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,685
>> He was a shyster, but he was

1001
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,728
cool.

1002
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,688
>> You know, I think it's

1003
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,272
daunting for a person that's

1004
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,149
traveled as much as me to be

1005
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,151
combined with a group of people

1006
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,113
that have traveled hardly ever

1007
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,906
out of their county, state,

1008
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,117
country, continent.

1009
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,243
I mean, it really...

1010
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,830
Gave a separation between us.

1011
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,499
You have to find common ground,

1012
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,167
and I didn't have the capacity

1013
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,085
to do that without having a

1014
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,753
slightly facetious look on my

1015
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,464
face.

1016
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,052
>> Good old Dan.

1017
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:33,386
>> I like Dan.

1018
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,220
He's a good guy.

1019
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,222
>> Yeah, he really had a heart

1020
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:36,973
of gold.

1021
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:37,807
>> He said he came out here to

1022
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,433
find himself.

1023
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,559
I think he might have pulled it

1024
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,435
off.

1025
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,060
>> I've always been an

1026
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,396
emotional person, and I think,

1027
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,273
with this game, I proved to

1028
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,232
myself that I have the ability

1029
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,066
to calm myself down.

1030
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,153
So, I need to take from it what

1031
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,238
I've learned and be okay with

1032
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,158
that.

1033
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,909
>> Oh, Marcus.

1034
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,119
>> Marcus.

1035
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,203
>> I always thought that Marcus

1036
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,414
would be in the top three.

1037
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,206
>> I think that playing

1038
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,124
<i>Survivor</i> gives you an

1039
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,835
appreciation for the way the

1040
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,419
world really works and that

1041
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,713
there are choices that you make

1042
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:09,881
every day that are good.

1043
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,757
There are choices that you make

1044
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,009
every day that are bad.

1045
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,635
I'd probably stand by my

1046
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,595
decision to throw the idol away

1047
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,138
because I feel like if it

1048
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,724
makes the game less sneaky, then

1049
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,892
that's good because I feel like

1050
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,101
one of the things that I tried

1051
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,187
to do in this game was to not

1052
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,899
try and double-cross people.

1053
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,735
>> Charlie.

1054
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,028
>> Charlie was a wonderful

1055
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:32,487
fellow.

1056
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,112
>> He was a great guy.

1057
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:33,654
Charlie was a really sweet

1058
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,573
person.

1059
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,575
>> I was really surprised with

1060
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,327
how, like, patient I was in the

1061
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,328
game, how I was able to foster

1062
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,538
relationships with people who I

1063
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,457
never ordinarily interact with

1064
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,374
in real life.

1065
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,876
And I'm hoping that when I go

1066
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,294
home, I'll be able to have

1067
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,171
those skills and integrate them

1068
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,215
into my real life and be proud

1069
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,759
of who I am.

1070
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,345
>> Randy.

1071
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,388
>> What I liked about Randy is

1072
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,015
he never minced words.

1073
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,058
You knew where you stood with

1074
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:02,892
Randy.

1075
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:03,601
>> You know what I've got to

1076
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,977
say about Randy?

1077
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,270
(blows raspberry)

1078
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,482
>> It surprised me because I

1079
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,150
was so hated by a good many

1080
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,529
people, but I was so well liked

1081
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,155
by just as many people.

1082
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,241
And I have not felt that

1083
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,576
closeness in 20-something years.

1084
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,370
I'm not a dumb-ass for falling

1085
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,329
for the fake idol.

1086
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,039
The people that voted me off

1087
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,749
were the dumb-asses.

1088
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,375
People screw people and lie to

1089
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,751
people.

1090
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,503
I played this game honestly,

1091
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,380
and<i> Survivor: Gabon</i> has shown

1092
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,632
me it's all right to make

1093
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,967
friends and it's all right to

1094
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,218
like people.

1095
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,220
>> Corinne.

1096
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,098
>> Corinne.

1097
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,558
She certainly knew how to

1098
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,767
tell you what she thought, also.

1099
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,269
>> Oh, yeah.

1100
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,687
>> I've always been the kind of

1101
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,771
person that says exactly what's

1102
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,397
on my mind and operates without

1103
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,731
a filter.

1104
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,024
And that is what is sort of

1105
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,192
endearing about me in general.

1106
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,527
And I think when you take that

1107
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,154
away, I'm just another girl who

1108
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,739
doesn't have much of a

1109
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,448
personality.

1110
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,491
Like, just being nice isn't

1111
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,869
really a personality trait that

1112
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,370
I find interesting.

1113
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,330
Anybody can be nice.

1114
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,337
>> Crystal.

1115
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,547
>> Good old Crystal.

1116
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,506
She was the muscle behind

1117
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,549
the mastermind.

1118
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,467
She got way far.

1119
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,303
>> The hardest part has been

1120
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,222
knowing that I came so close,

1121
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,309
and I didn't succeed.

1122
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,560
When you're used to being on

1123
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,436
top as a professional athlete,

1124
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,229
sometimes it's hard to lose.

1125
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,941
But in the end, I failed.

1126
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,735
And I think, for me, that has

1127
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,862
been very humbling.

1128
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,074
>> Kenny, the ultimate

1129
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:42,366
mastermind.

1130
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,118
He was the most conniving

1131
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,703
player in this entire game.

1132
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,495
>> I mean, I think genuinely,

1133
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,164
his personality, he really is a

1134
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:48,456
nice kid.

1135
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,207
>> He is a sweet kid.

1136
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,083
>> He was a threat.

1137
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:51,584
He was underestimated by

1138
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,669
everybody.

1139
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,588
>> Being out here with random

1140
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,423
strangers actually helped me

1141
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,717
grow as a person.

1142
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,760
I really did step up for

1143
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:00,968
myself.

1144
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,262
I really did want to choose my

1145
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,597
own path and go with my gut

1146
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,348
feeling instead of just staying

1147
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,768
back and being scared and I feel

1148
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,352
like I've kind of evolved that

1149
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,770
way.

1150
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,188
Even though I didn't win the

1151
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,731
million dollars, I won more

1152
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,357
than that because I grew as a

1153
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,108
person.

1154
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,693
And hopefully people can see

1155
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,070
the change in me because I

1156
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,363
really feel like I have changed

1157
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:23,324
and for the better.

1158

For today's challenge, you will

1171
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,090
each have 200 wooden tiles.

1172
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,841
On my "go," you will use those

1173
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,469

at the final Tribal Council

1178
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,063
and you will get a chance to

00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,314
plead your case for the million

1180
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:01,315
bucks.

1181
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:02,566

1182
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,110
where we will vote out the last

1183
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,444
person from this game.

1184
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,238
Big enough stakes?

1185
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,322
>> Yes.

1186
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:08,948
>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots.

00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,658

All right, guys, here we go.

1189
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:20,167
If after 30 minutes, nobody has

1190
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,585
built a house of cards ten feet

1191
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,504
tall, the person who has the

1192
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,840
highest house of cards will win.

1193
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,134
For immunity and a guaranteed

1194
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:28,634
spot at the final Tribal

1195
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,678
Council, survivors ready?

1196
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,639
Go.

1197
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,684
It is the first person to build

1198
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,103
a house of cards ten feet tall

1199
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,564
or the person with the highest

1200
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,774
house of cards after 30 minutes

1201
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,901
have elapsed.

1202
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,283
A lot of different approaches

1203
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,160
right now.

1204
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,619
Got to make sure your base is

1205
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,705
good and stable.

1206
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,583
Ten feet is a long way up.

1207
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,507
Sugar making a lot of progress.

1208
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,636
Is it sturdy enough?

1209
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,763
Bob still working to form a

1210
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,724
base.

1211
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,767
Matty and Bob still hovering

1212
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,769
near the bottom.

1213
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,897
Susie making a lot of progress.

1214
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,400
Susie's house of cards

1215
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:27,318
collapses.

1216
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,320
Susie is back to starting over.

1217
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,529
Sugar at five and a half feet.

1218
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,532
With a big lead, and a

1219
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,327
precarious house of cards.

1220
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,745
Sugar loses everything and just

1221
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,663
like that, after nine minutes

1222
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,749
into this challenge, we are

1223
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,042
back to square one.

1224
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:43,584
Everybody's in it.

1225
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,003
Bob has new life.

1226
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,504
Matty has new life.

1227
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,758
It's a brand-new challenge.

1228
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,717
This could be a million-dollar

1229
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,012
challenge for one of the four of

1230
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,556
you.

1231
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,184
Sugar is once again putting

1232
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:00,643
something up quickly.

1233
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,686
Bob getting something going.

1234
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,357
Matty continues to work very

1235
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,399
methodically.

1236
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,735
Susie gaining on Sugar.

1237
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,695
Susie now getting closer to the

1238
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,155
five-foot mark.

1239
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,032
Sugar now up at the six and a

1240
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:15,574
half feet.

1241
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,576
>> Oh, God.

1242
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,245
>> PROBST: Once again, Sugar's

1243
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:19,787
house of cards completely

1244
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,663
collapses.

1245
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:24,792
Susie now in the lead.

1246
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,919
Just past the five-foot mark.

1247
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,008
Susie loses her house of cards.

1248
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,761
Susie now starting over.

1249
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,222
Bob loses everything he had.

1250
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,724
Matty now in the lead,

1251
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,017
taking his time, building

1252
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,144
a solid foundation.

1253
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,538
Sugar once again in the lead.

1254
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,248
Up over six feet.

1255
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,208
Susie up over five feet.

1256
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,751
Matty up over four feet.

1257
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,171
Bob still struggling.

1258
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,673
To three feet.

1259
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,050
One of the most dominating

1260
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,802
forces in this game cannot get

1261
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,887
a house of cards going.

1262
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,560
We're at 25 minutes now.

1263
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,394
>> We have five left?

1264
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,521
>> PROBST: Five minutes left.

1265
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,608
You have five minutes left to

1266
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,278
build a house of cards as tall

1267
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,448
as you can, provided nobody

1268
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,908
gets to ten feet.

1269
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,327
Sugar being careful not to

1270
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,079
knock this one over.

1271
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,499
Susie not slowing down, now up

1272
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,959
at the six and a half feet.

1273
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,794
Matty at five and a half feet,

1274
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,005
looking very stable.

1275
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,007
Bob racing to get in this

1276
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,216
at three feet.

1277
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,260
Sugar getting close to the

1278
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,346
seven-foot mark.

1279
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,222
Once again, the big question:

1280
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,433
will it stay up?

1281
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,898
Susie way up over seven feet.

1282
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:15,319
>> Oh, God.

1283
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,196
There is no wiggle room when

1284
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,864
you start to get this high.

1285
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,116
The person who has the house of

1286
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,494
cards that reaches the highest

1287
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,454
and will stand up on its own

1288
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,206
without the aid of your hands

1289
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,917
will win immunity and be

1290
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,002
guaranteed a spot at the final

1291
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,338
Tribal Council.

1292
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,382
Susie at eight feet.

1293
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,509
Susie with the lead, and she is

1294
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,635
sitting on it.

1295
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,303
Matty trying to close the gap.

1296
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,180
Sugar trying to close the gap.

1297
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,724
You are going to have to hurry.

1298
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,018
Your last minute.

1299
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,688
Clock is ticking.

1300
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,816
Sugar is at seven feet.

1301
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,317
Matty a little over six and a

1302
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,944
half feet.

1303
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,780
Susie at eight feet.

1304
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,117
30 seconds left.

1305
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,910
Susie is not going to risk

1306
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,161
knocking her house of cards

1307
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,205
over.

1308
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,540
Sugar is still hovering near

1309
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,083
the seven-foot mark.

1310
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,044
Matty approaching seven feet

1311
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,504
with a very stable,

1312
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,881
solid-looking house of cards.

1313
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,008
15 seconds.

1314
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,056
Ten seconds.

1315
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:36,692
Five, four, three, two, one.

1316
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,943
Susie wins final immunity,

1317
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,154
guaranteed a spot at the final

1318
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,281
Tribal Council.

1319
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,620
>> Good job, Susie.

1320
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,800
>> PROBST: Susie, come on over.

1321
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,803
You won the first individual

1322
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,055
immunity challenge, now won the

1323
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,098
last.

1324
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,183
With this around your neck, you

1325
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,434
are guaranteed a spot at the

1326
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,393
final Tribal Council.

1327
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,644
You will get a chance to plead

1328
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,396
your case against the jury.

1329
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,940
Bob, Sugar, Matty, for you

1330
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,442
three, Tribal Council tonight,

1331
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,610
where one of you will be the

1332
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,819
last person voted out of this

1333
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,488
game, the last member of our

1334
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:22,821
jury.

1335
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:23,906
Should make for a very

1336
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,657
interesting afternoon.

1337
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,283
Grab your stuff.

1338
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,117
Head back to camp.

1339
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:27,868
I will see you at Tribal.

1340
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,954
Congratulations.

1341
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,623
>> I did not think I was going

1342
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,415
to win this immunity.

1343
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,042
I was totally in shock that I

1344
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:35,751
won today.

1345
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,960
I just was not expecting that

1346
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:37,836
at all.

1347
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,338
I super-needed it because I

1348
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,464
knew I was going to go home

1349
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:40,923
today.

1350
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,883
So now I'm not going home until

1351
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:43,550
tomorrow.

1352
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,677
(chuckles)

1353
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,179
>> This is definitely not what

1354
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,514
I expected when I got rid of

1355
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,515
Kenny yesterday.

1356
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,225
I thought that keeping Susie

1357
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,518
would be the smarter way to go

1358
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,478
because she would never win.

1359
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,688
But that's what happens when you

1360
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,399
underestimate somebody.

1361
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:20,337
(elephants trumpeting)

1362
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,922
>> It's been a good game, guys.

1363
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,090
>> You played great.

1364
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,049
>> You did, Bob.

1365
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:24,883
>> I wasn't expecting this at

1366
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,885
all.

1367
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:27,970
>> I don't know what to say,

1368
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:28,470
Bob.

1369
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,304
>> I really, I really thought

1370
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,556
tonight was going to be my night

1371
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,474
to go home, honestly.

1372
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,977
>> Sorry, it was just like...

1373
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,646
super emotional.

1374
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,482
>> Hey, guy.

1375
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,733
>> Appreciate our time out here,

1376
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:41,942
buddy.

1377
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,861
>> Yeah, yeah.

1378
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,613
Hey.

1379
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,075
>> Susie won, and, I mean...

1380
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,743
that means we have to vote for

1381
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,619
Bob.

1382
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,246
>> You been, you been good

1383
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:54,705
players.

1384
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,789
>> You friggin' did awesome,

1385
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:56,790
Bob.

1386
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,584
>> It's obvious that Bob would

1387
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,252
win, so Susie's going to be

1388
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:00,961
voting for Bob.

1389
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,297
And, I mean, he knows, he knows

1390
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,966
nobody would win against him.

1391
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,384
>> Well, it's been a good game.

1392
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,344
It's been fun.

1393
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,929
Been a good time.

1394
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,015
>> I have to write your name

1395
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,141
down, Bob, I'm sorry.

1396
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:14,600
>> That's all right.

1397
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,101
I-I got no problem.

1398
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,811
As Susie always says, it's a

1399
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:18,020
game.

1400
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,564
I know what it is, so...

1401
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,857
>> You are the best competitor

1402
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,275
out here, though, dude.

1403
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,359
>> I really thought for sure

1404
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:24,985
you were going to kick my butt,

1405
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,069
Bob.

1406
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,154
Too many times, I actually

1407
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,364
doubt myself.

1408
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,657
And I knew this time, I thought,

1409
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,491
"You can't have any doubt.

1410
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,618
You just have to tell yourself

1411
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,619
you're going to do it.

1412
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,911
You have to go in there and just

1413
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:35,662
tell yourself you're going to

1414
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,580
beat him; you're going to beat

1415
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,289
him."

1416
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,248
I thought, well, I'm going to

1417
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,499
go home tonight for sure.

1418
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,084
(chuckles): I really was.

1419
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,294
>> You can never count on

1420
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,920
anything in this game.

1421
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,088
>> Nope, expect the unexpected,

1422
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,884
I guess.

1423
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:49,426
I actually kind of shocked

1424
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,594
myself.

1425
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,178
Like, "Oh, my God, I think I

1426
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,679
just did it."

1427
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,138
I am the final three.

1428
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,057
That is so exciting.

1429
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,391
I'm always underestimated.

1430
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,060
I... people just think, "Like

1431
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,227
she's got a chance in hell that

1432
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,312
she'll ever accomplish

1433
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:00,562
anything."

1434
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,314
I visualized myself winning it.

1435
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,732
Like, I can do that, I can hear

1436
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,234
it, it's going to happen.

1437
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,653
I did.

1438
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,111
It's friggin' insane.

1439
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,572
I was not expecting that at all.

1440
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,157
I'm, like, in shock right now.

1441
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,575
I really am.

1442
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,660
I was nervous all day.

1443
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,661
I was kind of anxious.

1444
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,745
I'm in total shock.

1445
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:17,371
I can't friggin' believe that

1446
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,624
just happened.

1447
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,917
Hey, Bob, will you be honest

1448
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,209
with me?

1449
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,502
I'm going to ask you a

1450
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:23,752
question.

1451
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,587
You have to be honest with me.

1452
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,171
If you were to go with me to

1453
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,382
the final three, do you think

1454
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,132
you'd get a lot of jury vote?

1455
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,093
>> Do you want to go up against

1456
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,469
me?

1457
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,679
>> Do I want to?

1458
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,137
>> Yeah.

1459
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,055
>> I-I would rather you just

1460
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,139
tell me the truth so I can

1461
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,224
kind of know.

1462
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,475
>> There's really no point in

1463
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,434
even asking the question, you

1464
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:39,643
know.

1465
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,019
>> Well, I just, I just...

1466
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:41,561
>> No, there's no point in

1467
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,187
asking.

1468
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,731
>> I just opened a crack there

1469
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,357
for Bob to...

1470
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,900
I wanted him to know that I

1471
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,443
would have no problem, you know,

1472
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,361
taking Sugar out and bringing

1473
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,570
him with me.

1474
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,072
Had you or Bob won, I would have

1475
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,951
been going home.

1476
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:56,910
You can be honest with me.

1477
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:57,536
I mean, I would have been going

1478
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,453
home.

1479
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,579
>> Let's... how about if we talk

1480
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,122
about something else?

1481
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,415
We don't need.... we don't need

1482
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,165
to talk about this.

1483
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,041
You know, you know the score.

1484
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,251
We don't have to keep repeating

1485
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,669
it.

1486
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,587
Let's just have lunch, okay?

1487
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,964
>> He snapped a little bit at

1488
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,090
me, so I thought, "Okay, you

1489
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,510
just sealed your own fate."

1490
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,052
>> I'm just in shock.

1491
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,179
I wasn't expecting it at all.

1492
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,848
>> But I don't think he wants

1493
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,349
any constant reminders all day

1494
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,225
long that he lost.

1495
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,268
>> Don't worry about it.

1496
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,519
Just stop talking about it.

1497
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,228
>> Okay, all right.

1498
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,896
Apparently, I talk too much.

1499
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,859
Is it just me, or do I hear

1500
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:29,985
other people talking all the

1501
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:30,360
time, too?

1502
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,528
But maybe just, it's me more.

1503
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:31,862
I don't know.

1504
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:32,320
>> You-you talk a lot.

1505
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,822
(Sugar chuckles)

1506
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:34,948
You say everything that you're

1507
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,991
thinking.

1508
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,367
>> That's not, that's not good.

1509
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,285
>> Maybe you shouldn't say

1510
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,369
anything else about it for the

1511
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:39,786
rest of the night.

1512
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,163
'Cause, 'cause it's like, I know

1513
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,206
you like to say everything on

1514
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:43,915
your mind.

1515
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:44,499
And if you keep saying, "Oh, I

1516
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,876
can't believe it. I can't

1517
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:46,835
believe it," it's just going to

1518
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,003
bum him out a lot more.

1519
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:48,962
Say it to us.

1520
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:49,379
Don't say it to him.

1521
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,465
Just because... I mean, I-I

1522
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,257
really love him, and I just

1523
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,216
don't want him to have his

1524
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,177
feelings hurt any worse than

1525
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,094
they are.

1526
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,556
I really, really pictured Bob

1527
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,434
up there in the final three.

1528
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,436
If I were to vote for Matty and

1529
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,270
Bob were to vote for Matty, and

1530
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:08,148
Matty and Susie voted for Bob,

1531
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,025
there would be a tie.

1532
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,160
>> That would be really nice.

1533
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,287
I appreciate that.

1534
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,957
>> Okay.

1535
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,668
That sounds like a good idea.

1536
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,337
Causing a tie is an option

1537
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,464
worth considering.

1538
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,633
I guess that would be giving

1539
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,426
Bob another chance, but I told

1540
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,677
Matty I would never write his

1541
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,595
name down.

1542
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,597
I never promised Bob that.

1543
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,892
But to me, Bob is a father

1544
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:44,392
figure.

1545
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,353
I lost my dad recently, and

1546
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,145
that's probably, you know, why

1547
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:51,066
I-I kind of have the feeling of

1548
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,192
love towards Bob.

1549
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,693
He's the father figure of our

1550
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:53,860
tribe.

1551
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,445
Oh, God.

1552
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,196
It is a tough choice because

1553
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,074
it's like choosing between my

1554
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,200
dad and my brother.

1555
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,452
>> Wow, this is huge.

1556
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,703
>> Yeah.

1557
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,412
>> It's, like, shocking.

1558
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,497
I don't even know what to do.

1559
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,623
I'm nervous. I'm paranoid.

1560
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,376
I'm like... it's such close

1561
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,378
grasp, it's just like...

1562
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,339
I don't want it to slip through.

1563
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:17,092
>> He knows he's going home.

1564
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,969
He's going to be by himself and

1565
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,178
try and, like, you know,

1566
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:24,558
meditate or enjoy the last bit

1567
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,267
of this.

1568
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,613
>> I've talked to Sugar about

1569
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,447
the vote tonight.

1570
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,907
I'm going to vote for Matty,

1571
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,242
and Sugar told me that she'd

1572
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,743
vote for Matty, which means

1573
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,037
that it may come down to a

1574
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:46,997
tiebreaker.

1575
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,081
I don't know whether the

1576
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,374
tiebreaker is making fire or

1577
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,209
not, but I'm betting on it.

1578
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,635
I don't know exactly why Sugar

1579
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,804
is being so kind to me, but she

1580
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,307
has just been an absolute doll.

1581
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,975
I'm packing my bags tonight.

1582
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,810
I might go home, but hopefully,

1583
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:09,352
I don't.

1584
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,397
Hopefully, um, I stay here in a

1585
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,357
ball of fire.

1586
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,796
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1587
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,174
the members of our jury.

1588
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,846
Marcus, Charlie, Randy,

1589
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,390
Corinne, Crystal, and Kenny,

1590
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,434
voted out at the last Tribal

1591
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,269
Council.

1592
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,107
Susie, as of this moment, you

1593
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,359
are the only person who is

1594
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,569
guaranteed a spot at the final

1595
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,196
Tribal Council tomorrow night,

1596
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:01,821
who will get a chance to plead

1597
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,490
their case against the jury.

1598
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,659
What's the feeling right now?

1599
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,369
>> I'm very, very pleased and

1600
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:07,869
very proud of myself for

1601
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,079
getting to this point.

1602
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,081
So I-I just knew if I didn't win

1603
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,124
today, I was done.

1604
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,084
>> PROBST: On the flip side,

1605
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:14,668
Bob, for the first time in a

1606
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,503
long time, you do not have that

1607
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,255
immunity necklace, and you are

1608
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,548
vulnerable.

1609
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,258
>> This is probably the most

1610
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,843
uncomfortable Tribal Council

1611
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,388
I've been to in 38 days.

1612
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,389
>> PROBST: And you got four

1613
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:28,515
former tribe members you were

1614
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,934
close to sitting on the jury

1615
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:31,685
right now.

1616
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,103
>> People have said to me they

1617
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,688
didn't want me on the final

1618
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,148
three with them because people

1619
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,024
like me.

1620
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,276
Um, I am, without a doubt, a

1621
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,444
huge threat.

1622
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,445
>> PROBST: So knowing you're

1623
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,405
vulnerable and you're a target,

1624
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,782
what do you do in the few hours

1625
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,951
you have between the challenge

1626
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,452
and Tribal Council?

1627
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,537
>> You know, there's a limit to

1628
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,955
how much scrambling I can do.

1629
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,540
There's only four of us here.

1630
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,126
And I do have a target on my

1631
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,794
back, but I'm going to duck at

1632
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:58,795
the last moment if I can.

1633
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,171
I don't know how I can do that,

1634
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,174
but I'll give it a shot.

1635
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,384
>> PROBST: Matty, was it a busy

1636
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,927
afternoon when you guys got

1637
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,429
back from the challenge?

1638
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:07,846
>> You know what?

1639
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,848
Around camp, I didn't really

1640
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,266
feel the scrambling as much as

1641
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:11,891
I felt the scrambling in my own

1642
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,227
head because when the end is so

1643
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,854
close, it's like you don't want

1644
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,022
it to slip away.

1645
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,440
And at any moment, it can in

1646
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,024
this game.

1647
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,775
I mean, you never know what's

1648
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,651
going on in this game.

1649
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,610
No matter how much you think

1650
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,029
you know, you don't know

1651
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:24,487
anything.

1652
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,447
>> PROBST: Matty, take me

1653
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,282
through your options.

1654
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,159
You can only vote for Bob or

1655
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:29,993
Sugar.

1656
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:30,618
>> You know what?

1657
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,371
Sugar went out a limb for me and

1658
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,456
saved me by giving me the

1659
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,833
immunity idol, and there's no

1660
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:37,459
way that I could stab her in the

1661
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,543
back at this point.

1662
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,920
And I can't vote for Susie

1663
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,213
because she has the immunity

1664
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:42,964
necklace.

1665
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:46,509
So... my options are limited.

1666
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,595
>> PROBST: Bob, you can vote

1667
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,387
out Matty or you can cast a

1668
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,472
vote for Sugar.

1669
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,516
Talk me through your choices.

1670
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,977
>> Uh, Matty's well liked by

1671
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,020
people on the jury.

1672
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:59,022
He's a-a nice guy.

1673
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,483
So I'd be better off going with

1674
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:05,236
Sugar and Susie.

1675
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:05,779
>> PROBST: All right, Sugar,

1676
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,530
take me through it for you.

1677
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,867
>> I'd lose to both of them.

1678
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,995
And I love them both, so I feel

1679
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,205
like Matty's kind of like a

1680
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,664
brother.

1681
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,624
And I feel kind of like Bob is

1682
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,918
like a dad.

1683
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,378
I feel the same for them both.

1684
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,254
>> PROBST: And you have to

1685
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,381
choose tonight between voting

1686
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,674
one or the other.

1687
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,013
Matty, how's it make you feel

1688
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,681
to hear Sugar talk about you

1689
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,266
like a brother?

1690
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,351
>> Feels pretty good.

1691
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,477
You know, I look at Sugar kind

1692
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:37,852
of like a sister.

1693
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,562
And, uh, when you go through

1694
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,855
this with somebody, you develop

1695
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,190
a relationship with them.

1696
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,234
And if you can endure this game,

1697
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,945
you definitely earn my respect.

1698
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,363
>> PROBST: Bob, tell me about

1699
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,656
your relationship with Sugar.

1700
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,324
She referred to you as a father

1701
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,785
figure, which is significant in

1702
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,703
Sugar's life.

1703
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,038
>> I realize that.

1704
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,290
I-I feel really good that I've

1705
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,917
made that sort of an impression

1706
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,918
on her.

1707
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,837
I am a father, and I'm, and I'm

1708
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,799
a, I'm a damn...

1709
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,760
(sobs, clears throat)

1710
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,221
Yeah.

1711
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,097
>> You're a good dad.

1712
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,181
>> I'm a good dad.

1713
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,266
(clears throat)

1714
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:16,850
I'm a father, and I'm a damn

1715
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,894
good one because I had the best

1716
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,604
father anybody could have.

1717
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,648
So I had a great example, and I

1718
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,401
tried to follow it.

1719
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,486
I think I've done a good job.

1720
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,447
>> PROBST: So now how hard is

1721
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,907
it for you to know that she has

1722
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:33,700
this difficult decision?

1723
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,369
She has a father figure and a

1724
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:38,246
brother figure, and she has to

1725
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:38,872
choose one.

1726
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,832
She has no option.

1727
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,584
>> It is the cruelest situation

1728
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,419
that she can be put in, without

1729
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:45,461
a doubt.

1730
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,547
Uh, but she's there, and I hope

1731
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,508
she makes a good decision.

1732
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,552
>> PROBST: Well, the time for

1733
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,512
that situation is upon us.

1734
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,222
Susie, you have the necklace.

1735
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,140
I can't imagine you're giving

1736
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:57,724
it up.

1737
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,559
>> Nope, I can't give it up.

1738
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,143
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1739
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,186
Susie.

1740
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,188
Everybody else is fair game, and

1741
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:03,605
it is time to vote.

1742
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,191
Matty, you're up.

1743
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,072
>> I know in a short amount of

1744
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,866
time, Bob, you made a major

1745
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,201
impact on my life.

1746
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,911
And I, uh, truly respect the

1747
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,038
game that you've played.

1748
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,134
>> Hey, Matty, little love

1749
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,011
from my friends.

1750
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,571
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1751
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,698
votes.

1752
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,709
Once the votes are read, the

1753
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:07,710
decision is final.

1754
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:08,878
Person voted out will be asked

1755
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:09,921
to leave the Tribal Council

1756
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,005
area immediately.

1757
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,465
I'll read the votes.

1758
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:19,222
First vote: Bob.

1759
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:23,768
Bob.

1760
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,728
Two votes Bob.

1761
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,068
Matty.

1762
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,820
Two votes Bob; one vote Matty;

1763
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,697
one vote left.

1764
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,834
Matty.

1765
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,752
We have a tie.

1766
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:54,757
In the case of a tie, with only

1767
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,343
four people left, we go to a

1768
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:57,885
fire-making tiebreaker

1769
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,054
challenge.

1770
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,857
All right, Matty, Bob, you can

1771
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,108
each take a spot at a

1772
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,901
fire-making station.

1773
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:20,742
You each have a flint and steel.

1774
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,660
You each have a box of

1775
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,579
fire-making materials.

1776
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,664
First person to build a flame

1777
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,666
high enough that lasts long

1778
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,460
enough to burn through the rope

1779
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,878
stays in this game, joins Susie

1780
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,839
and Sugar at the final Tribal

1781
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:35,048
Council.

1782
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,883
Loser goes home.

1783
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,718
Clear?

1784
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,428
Been out here 38 days.

1785
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:41,763
Making fire is a part of living

1786
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:42,680
out here.

1787
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,849
This challenge is on.

1788
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:00,823
Bob has a nice pile of

1789
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,867
magnesium.

1790
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:03,743
So does Matty.

1791
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,953
Matty's trying to get a spark

1792
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,039
using that husk.

1793
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,169
Getting a lot of spark, but no

1794
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,088
flame yet.

1795
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,053
Bob first to get fire.

1796
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:26,307
Bob has a good flame going, but

1797
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,850
a lot of that's going to go

1798
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,228
away quickly.

1799
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,938
Bob trying to hang on to that

1800
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,690
flame.

1801
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,238
(Matty coughs)

1802
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,414
Bob's flame is out.

1803
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,541
Trying to bring it back to life.

1804
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,295
Bob and Matty fighting for a

1805
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,797
spot at that final Tribal

1806
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,133
Council and a chance to plead

1807
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,426
their case for a million

1808
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,387
dollars.

1809
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,683
Bob not giving up, trying to

1810
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:12,603
bring it back.

1811
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,062
Bob's brought it back.

1812
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,022
He's got flame again.

1813
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,077
Matty needs to get in this.

1814
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,999
Bob has resuscitated his fire,

1815
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,209
and he's got a legitimate fire

1816
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,502
going now.

1817
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,003
Bob doing a good job of

1818
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,464
nurturing that fire.

1819
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,007
It's getting bigger, stronger.

1820
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:52,977
Bob's got an inferno going

1821
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,103
right now.

1822
01:02:59,108 --> 01:02:59,859
Flames starting to hit the rope

1823
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,403
just a little bit.

1824
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:09,076
Matty still struggling.

1825
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,036
Bob has burned through the rope.

1826
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,829
Bob has won this challenge.

1827
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,457
Bob is moving on to the final

1828
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,082
and will have a shot at winning

1829
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,834
this game and the million

1830
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,003
dollars.

1831
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,734
>> PROBST: Matty, the tribe has

1832
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:42,860
spoken.

1833
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,616
Time for you to go.

1834
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,290
Well, Susie, Bob, Sugar,

1835
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:56,958
congratulations.

1836
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,918
You have gone as far as you can

1837
01:03:59,001 --> 01:03:59,961
go in this game.

1838
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:02,213
The power in this game now

1839
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,005
shifts to the jury.

1840
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,217
Seven people, including Matty,

1841
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:06,884
who you had a hand, either

1842
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,094
directly or indirectly, in

1843
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,555
voting out of this game, now

1844
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,807
hold your fate in their hands.

1845
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:13,432
I'll see you tomorrow night for

1846
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,768
your final Tribal Council.

1847
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:16,310
Grab your torches.

1848
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,103
Head back to camp.

1849
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,981
Good night.

1850
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:26,988
>> I've learned more about

1851
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,448
myself and about life in the

1852
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,910
last 38 days than I ever have.

1853
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,746
I grew up quick.

1854
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,331
And I'm grateful to have this

1855
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,124
opportunity, and I wouldn't

1856
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:42,128
trade it in for the world.

1857
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,975
(elephants trumpeting)

1858
01:04:56,058 --> 01:05:00,271
(animals grunting)

1859
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:12,074
>> I'm going to mark off day

1860
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,702
39, the last day.

1861
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,329
>> This is it.

1862
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,413
Perfect.

1863
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,414
Oh, we did it!

1864
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:19,123
Woo-hoo!

1865
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:19,957
(clapping)

1866
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,667
>> ♪ You can do it if you try. ♪

1867
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,168
(Susie laughs)

1868
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,919
>> We got it.

1869
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:24,670
Day 39.

1870
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,713
That's a big day.

1871
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:26,339
Sugar, you want to count them?

1872
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,965
Ready?

1873
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,052
One, two, three, four, five...

1874
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,220
Day 39, and I'm still here.

1875
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,055
I-I'm kicking.

1876
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,181
I couldn't believe it.

1877
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,599
I really just kept believing.

1878
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:37,058
Just-just keep trying.

1879
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,225
All you got to do is keep

1880
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,435
trying, and if you just focus on

1881
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,144
that, you can get through it.

1882
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:42,521
Day 39.

1883
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,522
Woo-hoo.

1884
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,607
I really just wanted to show,

1885
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,233
like, especially my son, what it

1886
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:46,859
meant to try.

1887
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:47,401
And if you just try, you can

1888
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,527
make it.

1889
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,111
And I did.

1890
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,112
I'm here on day 39.

1891
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,322
Is that crazy?

1892
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,698
It's insane.

1893
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,997
We're going to tree mail.

1894
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,540
>> Cool.

1895
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,166
>> Nice.

1896
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:04,710
>> Yeah!

1897
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,336
>> Cool!

1898
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,337
>> And batter!

1899
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,421
Pancake batter.

1900
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,506
Yay!

1901
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:09,590
>> Yes!

1902
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,092
Oh, my God, that's exciting.

1903
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,134
>> Oh, no mail, just this.

1904
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,261
>> Shall we... can you carry

1905
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,012
that and I'll carry this?

1906
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,055
>> Yep.

1907
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,307
>> Oh, my God.

1908
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,017
Oh, yes.

1909
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,227
It's day 39, baby.

1910
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,520
We're going to have us a nice

1911
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:23,396
meal.

1912
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,063
>> We just got tree mail, and it

1913
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,731
was a feast.

1914
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,108
So we had a nice brunch.

1915
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,401
(laughs)

1916
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:28,734
>> Final three.

1917
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,652
>> Final three.

1918
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:30,194
Whoo!

1919
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,362
>> You guys going to be able to

1920
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:32,113
eat everything?

1921
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:32,655
>> Oh, yeah.

1922
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:33,322
>> Oh, yeah.

1923
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,740
Making bacon.

1924
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:35,950
>> It's really yummy.

1925
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,034
>> Oh, my God, it's so good.

1926
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,370
I've come a long way, baby.

1927
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:40,788
It's incredible.

1928
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,206
Except for Marcus, I pretty

1929
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,624
much had something to do with

1930
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,250
the ousting of everyone on the

1931
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,127
jury.

1932
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,920
And that's why I'm scared to

1933
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:48,629
death of the jury.

1934
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,089
(laughs)

1935
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,174
I mean, geez, they hate me,

1936
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,134
but, you know, what are you

1937
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:53,426
going to do?

1938
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,594
I might get a jury vote or two.

1939
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:56,595
I hope so.

1940
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,221
That'd be nice.

1941
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,349
>> Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

1942
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,225
Oh, guys, I couldn't imagine

1943
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:03,644
having a breakfast with better

1944
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:04,729
people.

1945
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,397
>> Me, neither.

1946
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,329
>> Oh, it's going to go, huh?

1947
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:23,122
>> I'm building my last final

1948
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,081
gadget.

1949
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,917
And that is a, uh, fiery

1950
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,545
good-bye to, uh, the Garden of

1951
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:30,212
Eden.

1952
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,672
This is why my mother wouldn't

1953
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,382
let me play with matches.

1954
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,258
(Susie chuckles)

1955
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:35,301
>> You're a bit of a pyro

1956
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,427
yourself, aren't you?

1957
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,762
>> Oh, yeah.

1958
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,055
We just packed the inside of

1959
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,182
the hut with pieces of the

1960
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:44,059
other hut, so that we can torch

1961
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,186
it and, uh, say good-bye to, uh,

1962
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:48,814
Nobag camp in a, uh, blaze of

1963
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,107
glory.

1964
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:53,444
Okay, Susie, let's go.

1965
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,111
Time to say good night.

1966
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,363
I still got one more major

1967
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,532
thing to do in Gabon, and that

1968
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:01,535
is convince the jury that my

1969
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,955
behavior, my work, uh, my

1970
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,332
participation in this game is

1971
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,084
worth winning a million dollars

1972
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:12,838
over Susie and over Sugar.

1973
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,256
>> Let's do it. Let's do it.

1974
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:18,302
>> Right...

1975
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,221
Right there.

1976
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:23,224
Right there.

1977
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,392
>> Oh, my God!

1978
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,519
>> Wow, look at that.

1979
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:26,769
>> Whoa.

1980
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,562
>> Whoo!

1981
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:29,605
>> You did a good job, Bob.

1982
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:30,189
(Bob laughs)

1983
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,232
>> Holy crap.

1984
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,442
>> Look at that, how it's just

1985
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:34,693
coming right down.

1986
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,528
Wow!

1987
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,196
>> That's how fast

1988
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,239
stuff comes and goes.

1989
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:39,281
>> 39 days, just like that.

1990
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,366
>> 39 days.

1991
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,034
>> Done.

1992
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:42,743
>> Done.

1993
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:43,619
>> Crazy, isn't it?

1994
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,329
>> Yes.

1995
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,966
>> I am looking forward to-to

1996
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:57,591
going to Tribal tonight because

1997
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,426
I really want the truth.

1998
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,636
I really think that Sugar did

1999
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,262
play a good game.

2000
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:02,888
She took control of the game.

2001
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,765
Her name was never written down.

2002
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:05,349
And that was huge.

2003
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:08,769
And I really need to know why

2004
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:09,353
Susie thinks she deserves a

2005
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,397
million dollars over the other

2006
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,648
two people.

2007
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:13,274
And I want Bob to admit that he

2008
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:14,358
did back out on his deal.

2009
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:16,777
And I want him to admit that,

2010
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,237
you know, he's not an honorable

2011
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,614
person that he said he was.

2012
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,825
>> I genuinely don't like any

2013
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:23,951
of these three people.

2014
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:24,535
I don't think there's much I

2015
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,871
could hear from the three

2016
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,081
finalists that could change my

2017
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:31,500
opinion of these people except

2018
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:31,709
Sugar.

2019
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,168
You know, she's made some

2020
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,503
fairly decent moves in this

2021
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:35,170
game.

2022
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:35,754
I don't know what Bob is going

2023
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,214
to say, but one thing's for

2024
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,300
sure: I'm going to tear him a

2025
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:40,050
new one.

2026
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,552
It's simply an opportunity for

2027
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,137
revenge, pure and simple.

2028
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,138
Revenge.

2029
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,932
>> For me, the final words

2030
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:47,558
I say at Tribal...

2031
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:49,852
It's a chance for me to be me.

2032
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:50,436
Right before I was voted out,

2033
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,272
I was unable to really let them

2034
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,149
have it.

2035
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,066
I would like to say the things

2036
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,985
that I wish I could have said if

2037
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,696
I wasn't on the chopping block.

2038
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,257
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

2039
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,385
the members of our jury.

2040
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:27,348
Marcus, Charlie, Randy,

2041
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:31,518
Corinne, Crystal, Kenny, and

2042
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,812
Matty, voted out at the last

2043
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,482
Tribal Council.

2044
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:43,948
Susie, Bob, Sugar,

2045
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,074
congratulations.

2046
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,993
You have gone as far as you can

2047
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:48,494
go in this game.

2048
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,454
The power in the game now

2049
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,165
shifts to the jury.

2050
01:10:53,248 --> 01:10:54,291
Seven people that you had a

2051
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,834
hand, either directly or

2052
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:56,877
indirectly, in voting out of

2053
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,504
this game now hold your fate in

2054
01:10:58,587 --> 01:10:59,296
their hands.

2055
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,297
Tonight they're going to be

2056
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,424
gathering information to help

2057
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,592
them make a million-dollar

2058
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,052
decision.

2059
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:06,720
Here's how it will work: you

2060
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:07,930
will each get a chance to make

2061
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,431
an opening statement, why you

2062
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:10,557
deserve to win this game.

2063
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:11,308
The jury will then get a chance

2064
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:12,309
to address you.

2065
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,728
Then we vote.

2066
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,772
Ready to get started?

2067
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:19,108
Susie, opening statement.

2068
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,110
>> I feel I deserve this

2069
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,988
because I came into this

2070
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:25,239
just wanting to try.

2071
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,532
That's all I wanted: to teach my

2072
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,033
son is what it meant to try.

2073
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,326
I wanted to teach my students

2074
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:29,785
what it means to try.

2075
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:33,497
So for me, it's very important

2076
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,959
that I succeed, just in trying.

2077
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:37,543
On day one, I didn't feel that

2078
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:38,961
confident.

2079
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:39,878
I was really scared.

2080
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,171
I was going up against an

2081
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:42,923
Olympic gold medalist, a

2082
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,383
doctor, you know, a management

2083
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,593
consultant, a #1 video gamer,

2084
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,637
the pharmaceutical rep,

2085
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:49,930
the video rep...

2086
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:50,556
I was going up against good

2087
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:50,764
people.

2088
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:51,557
And I'm standing here against

2089
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,684
Bob, and I'm not afraid to

2090
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:54,351
stand against Bob.

2091
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,602
And so that's why I feel I

2092
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:55,894
deserve it.

2093
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:56,437
Because day one, I wasn't

2094
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,189
confident, but day 39, I am very

2095
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,357
confident, and I feel very

2096
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,400
comfortable telling you guys

2097
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,653
that.

2098
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,322
>> PROBST: Bob.

2099
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,282
>> For 38 days, I'd hope you

2100
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:09,700
wouldn't write down my name.

2101
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,911
39, I hope you do.

2102
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,497
I played with gusto, with my

2103
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,582
heart.

2104
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,875
I've played hard.

2105
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:20,627
My game strategy was to come in

2106
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,464
here and use my personality, my

2107
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:27,176
survival skills, to make my life

2108
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,510
and your lives better while I

2109
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,179
was here.

2110
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,930
I don't think I outwitted you.

2111
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,891
I don't think I outplayed you.

2112
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:34,600
The only thing I did was

2113
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:38,562
outlast you, but I'd just like

2114
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:39,938
to say that you people made

2115
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:40,856
this game one of the most

2116
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,524
exciting adventures of my life,

2117
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,485
and I feel privileged to have

2118
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:47,321
spent it with all of you, and I

2119
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:50,616
would appreciate it if you

2120
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:54,453
could toss a vote my way.

2121
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,496
>> PROBST: Sugar.

2122
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:57,915
>> Uh, hey.

2123
01:12:57,998 --> 01:12:59,458
I'm sitting up here because I

2124
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,126
feel like I played a perfect

2125
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,002
social game.

2126
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,670
I surprised myself in the

2127
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:05,255
physical department a couple of

2128
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:05,714
times.

2129
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,050
But, um, I had to lie, and

2130
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:09,009
that's part of the game, a

2131
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:09,760
couple of times.

2132
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,762
And I had to sacrifice some

2133
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:12,429
innocents and I'm really sorry.

2134
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:15,599
And, uh, 38 days nobody wrote

2135
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:16,558
down by name, but everybody

2136
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,352
thought about it.

2137
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,603
So, uh, the immunity necklace I

2138
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:22,314
found within 24 hours of my stay

2139
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,524
on Exile.

2140
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:25,109
And I didn't play it until the

2141
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:27,027
very end, and I think I've

2142
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,570
played a pretty darn good game

2143
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,530
for somebody who's physically

2144
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:31,615
weak and didn't know what the

2145
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:33,408
heck I was doing when I started.

2146
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:33,951
I've been a free agent the

2147
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,160
whole time.

2148
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,829
I was in Kota nine days, ten

2149
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,580
days on Exile, two different

2150
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:39,832
tribes at Fang, and then the

2151
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:40,916
merge, so...

2152
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,543
I just was in it the whole time

2153
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:42,835
by myself.

2154
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,337
But I never sought out an

2155
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,631
alliance until I made an

2156
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:49,716
alliance with Bob at the end to

2157
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,260
save him because I feel he

2158
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:53,345
deserves to be up here.

2159
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,596
And that's it.

2160
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,597
Thanks for playing.

2161
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,057
(laughing)

2162
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,142
>> PROBST: All right, jury, in

2163
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,059
a minute you're going to get

2164
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,602
your first chance to address

2165
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,647
Susie, Bob, and Sugar.

2166
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:04,857
I'll give you a moment to think

2167
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,984
about what you want to say.

2168
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:21,415
>> PROBST: All right, jury.

2169
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:22,040
You have waited, some of you a

2170
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,376
long time, to get your first

2171
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,212
shot at addressing Susie, Bob,

2172
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:27,796
and Sugar.

2173
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,548
You can address any or all of

2174
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:29,756
them.

2175
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,550
Charlie, you're up first.

2176
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,677
Get us started.

2177
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:38,599
>> Hi.

2178
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,100
Uh, my first question is for the

2179
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,059
ladies.

2180
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,728
When Jeff asked us to rank each

2181
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,354
other and evaluate our peers,

2182
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:45,731
Susie, you were rated as the

2183
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,442
worst of your tribe.

2184
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,027
Sugar, you were rated the

2185
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:50,652
second worst of your tribe.

2186
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,697
Why do you think we should vote

2187
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,531
you the top of the totem pole,

2188
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,533
now that we're making a new

2189
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,368
peer assessment and give you a

2190
01:14:58,452 --> 01:14:59,119
million dollars?

2191
01:14:59,203 --> 01:14:59,828
Susie?

2192
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,206
>> Because I always knew that I

2193
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:03,665
was going to be underestimated,

2194
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,792
but I never gave up on what it

2195
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:06,585
meant to try and that was my

2196
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,045
whole lesson for myself, for my

2197
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:09,463
son, for my students.

2198
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:11,173
So, as much as it hurt to be at

2199
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:13,091
the bottom, I still feel that

2200
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:13,800
I'm still trying.

2201
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:14,343
Even right now, I'm still

2202
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:15,427
trying.

2203
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:16,136
That's why I deserve to be

2204
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,221
where I'm at, and I deserve to

2205
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:17,721
win this.

2206
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:18,680
>> Great.

2207
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,390
Um, Sugar?

2208
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,142
>> I don't know.

2209
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,810
I don't necessarily think you

2210
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,187
have to vote for me, but it

2211
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,064
would be nice.

2212
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,024
>> Huh. Okay.

2213
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:31,193
Um, now, I have a question for

2214
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:31,777
Bob.

2215
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,487
We spent a lot of time

2216
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,489
together, and I'm curious if

2217
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:37,282
you feel that all of our

2218
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,326
intimate cuddling and spooning

2219
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:41,245
all night long might have been

2220
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,497
a little more enjoyable than

2221
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:44,289
you would like to admit?

2222
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:44,873
>> You're a wonderful person.

2223
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,583
I like you a lot.

2224
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:47,626
And you're nice and warm at

2225
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:48,460
night.

2226
01:15:48,543 --> 01:15:49,670
I don't give a hoot.

2227
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,380
>> That's what I wanted to hear.

2228
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:52,256
(laughter)

2229
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:53,173
Thanks, guys.

2230
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:54,841
>> PROBST: Thanks, Charlie.

2231
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,969
Crystal, you're up.

2232
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:01,807
>> Sue, if coattail riding is

2233
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,978
your strategy, bravo, because

2234
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,437
you're a coattail rider.

2235
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:11,149
You rode coattails from day one.

2236
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,528
Bob, strategically, the young

2237
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:15,028
lady sitting next to you

2238
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,322
remote-controlled you like a

2239
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,449
race car up and down Gabon.

2240
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,118
You need to tell me something

2241
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:21,827
that you thought of that Sugar

2242
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,454
didn't remote-control you to do.

2243
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,623
>> Strategy-wise, I would say,

2244
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,667
no, I was riding coattails.

2245
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,752
I really didn't need to do

2246
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:31,837
anything differently to get

2247
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,298
where I'm sitting.

2248
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:36,091
>> And my last question is to

2249
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:36,967
Sugar.

2250
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,594
I think we've been aligned

2251
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:38,927
since day ten.

2252
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,513
I didn't lie to you, I mean,

2253
01:16:41,596 --> 01:16:42,514
even to the littlest things.

2254
01:16:42,597 --> 01:16:43,390
"Crystal, do I have any boogers

2255
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:44,016
in my nose?"

2256
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,809
I would do a booger check.

2257
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:49,271
I need to know why you voted me

2258
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,230
out.

2259
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:51,606
>> Crystal, honestly, it was

2260
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,858
because of the way you talk and

2261
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:53,692
treat people.

2262
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:54,943
Even though that's the way you

2263
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:56,903
are, and I like it, you were

2264
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:57,738
bullying people.

2265
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,949
So, I know it was strategically

2266
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,492
better for you to be up here

2267
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,412
with me than Bob, but I went

2268
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:06,038
with my heart, thought that you

2269
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:06,663
would forgive me.

2270
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:07,706
And I believe that you will.

2271
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,958
I believe that we'll still be

2272
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:10,751
friends.

2273
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:11,835
>> I ain't got nothing else to

2274
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:12,002
say.

2275
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:13,545
>> PROBST: Thanks, Crystal.

2276
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:14,838
>> All right.

2277
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:16,798
>> PROBST: Kenny.

2278
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:21,762
>> Susie, why do you think you

2279
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:23,805
deserve the million dollars and

2280
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:24,765
my vote?

2281
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:25,265
>> I know from the very

2282
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,225
beginning, I told you the reason

2283
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:27,893
why I wanted to play this game.

2284
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,062
And I told you that you and I

2285
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:30,979
were both underdogs.

2286
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,147
I'm just an average, ordinary

2287
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,231
housewife who thought I was

2288
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:33,982
never going to get to this

2289
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,817
point and I really believed it

2290
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,153
when I told you that.

2291
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,989
>> Okay, Sugar, I really did

2292
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:41,239
trust you.

2293
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,824
I opened up my heart, you know.

2294
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,701
You are the first girl I could

2295
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:45,035
really trust.

2296
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,996
And hopefully, my dating life

2297
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,081
isn't going to be so hard after

2298
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,207
this.

2299
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,666
But you did really scar me.

2300
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:52,292
>> I'm sorry.

2301
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,085
>> And it really hurt.

2302
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,212
So I want to know why you

2303
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:56,671
backstabbed me.

2304
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,382
>> Okay.

2305
01:17:58,465 --> 01:17:59,841
I'm sorry.

2306
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,510
I had an alliance, also, with

2307
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:03,845
Matty, and also with Bob, and

2308
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,263
literally...

2309
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:05,764
Sorry, Kenny.

2310
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:06,765
I thought you were a bigger

2311
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:07,808
threat than her.

2312
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:09,935
When she took the last

2313
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,144
immunity, I had totally

2314
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:12,020
underestimated her.

2315
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,688
I truly thought that you were a

2316
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,649
bigger threat.

2317
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:16,525
>> For some reason, I don't

2318
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:17,567
believe you.

2319
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:18,527
>> It's totally the honest

2320
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,069
truth.

2321
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:20,445
I'm sorry.

2322
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,488
>> Okay.

2323
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:23,156
Bob, now that I'm out of the

2324
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,282
game, I'm going to go back to

2325
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,659
the deal that we made.

2326
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:26,743
The deal was that you won the

2327
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,912
next challenge, that you'd give

2328
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:30,664
me the immunity necklace.

2329
01:18:30,747 --> 01:18:31,957
So I want to know what happened.

2330
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,251
>> When I said that, I intended

2331
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:34,835
to do it.

2332
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:37,170
Assuming that when I said,

2333
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:37,963
"I will protect you," you would

2334
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:39,965
protect me.

2335
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,550
Once I became aware of the fact

2336
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:43,260
that you were organizing an

2337
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:45,345
assassination on me, you became

2338
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,012
the enemy.

2339
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:46,805
Sorry about that.

2340
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:47,722
>> That was not what I wanted

2341
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:48,557
to hear from you, Bob.

2342
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,850
Okay, thanks.

2343
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,226
That's it.

2344
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:52,936
>> PROBST: Thanks, Kenny.

2345
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:55,105
Corinne.

2346
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:58,024
(clearing throat)

2347
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,943
(sighing loudly)

2348
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,570
>> Susie, I have one question

2349
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:02,863
for you, and if you can answer

2350
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:04,197
yes to this question, I will

2351
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,867
give you my million-dollar vote.

2352
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,244
If you get the money, will you

2353
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:11,204
agree to have your vocal chords

2354
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,080
removed?

2355
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,999
(laughter)

2356
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:16,251
>> No, because I am a talker.

2357
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:16,460
Sorry.

2358
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:17,752
>> Okay, thank you.

2359
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:18,879
Bob, um...

2360
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:21,506
I adore you.

2361
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,299
You know that.

2362
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:22,883
The only qualm I have about

2363
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,968
voting for you, you are

2364
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,303
somewhat one-dimensional.

2365
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:27,929
I've already met nice Bob and

2366
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,055
I've played with nice Bob, and

2367
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,849
tonight I want to see nasty Bob.

2368
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,684
Make me believe that you don't

2369
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,060
like Sugar.

2370
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:36,062
>> I can stand up and say that

2371
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:37,481
Sugar did things that I didn't

2372
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:38,482
like.

2373
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,025
When I blindsided Randy with my

2374
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,985
fake idol, I didn't feel rude

2375
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:43,820
about that, but I felt horrible

2376
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,906
the way Sugar stuck it in his

2377
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:47,908
face afterwards.

2378
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:49,826
But in the last couple of

2379
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:50,535
days...

2380
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,161
>> Don't get nice.

2381
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:51,828
I don't relate well to nice

2382
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:52,037
people.

2383
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,039
Stay nasty.

2384
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:54,998
>> I'm done.

2385
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:57,167
>> I'll take that.

2386
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,544
Sugar, you are an unemployed,

2387
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,046
uneducated leech on society.

2388
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,047
And the only thing I would vote

2389
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,424
to give you is a handful of

2390
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:06,510
antidepressants so that no one

2391
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:07,469
else has to be subjected to

2392
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:08,053
your constant crying anymore,

2393
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,805
and maybe if you got some, then

2394
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:11,389
it would seem a little more

2395
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,557
sincere when you are crying

2396
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,309
about your dead father.

2397
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:17,145
You don't deserve the million.

2398
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,065
Thank you, everyone.

2399
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,734
>> All righty.

2400
01:20:22,817 --> 01:20:23,902
Nice.

2401
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:27,197
>> PROBST: Marcus, you're up.

2402
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:30,909
>> So, guys, as you know, I'm

2403
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:34,663
a physician, and I see people

2404
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:35,956
all the time with health

2405
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:37,249
problems that they might have

2406
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,458
avoided had they made different

2407
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:39,501
choices.

2408
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,628
Now, Susie, you came to

2409
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:43,338
Earth's last Eden proud to be

2410
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,173
a mother and a child educator.

2411
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,300
I'm surprised, for someone

2412
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:48,009
coming form those roles, "just

2413
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:51,388
a game" is all it took for you

2414
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:53,348
to shed your obligation to be a

2415
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:53,890
positive role model in the

2416
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:54,891
biggest game of all.

2417
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:57,561
And that's life.

2418
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,062
Now, Sugar, I'm assuming that

2419
01:20:59,145 --> 01:21:01,189
your father really did pass

2420
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:01,398
away.

2421
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:02,774
>> Yeah, he really did pass

2422
01:21:02,857 --> 01:21:03,316
away.

2423
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,276
You and I have something in

2424
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:04,484
common.

2425
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:06,736
Both you and I have lost

2426
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:07,404
somebody that was very

2427
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:09,072
important from our family.

2428
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,283
What I want to know from you is,

2429
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,742
will you use a portion of your

2430
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:14,160
million dollars to honor your

2431
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:15,996
family member as I would have?

2432
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:17,289
And I want to know how.

2433
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,832
>> I never even considered

2434
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:20,208
actually winning a million

2435
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,668
dollars, but if I did, I would

2436
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:23,545
definitely put some for lung

2437
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,005
cancer, but also for children

2438
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,214
because that's my favorite

2439
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,549
cause, but my dad died of lung

2440
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:28,592
cancer, so...

2441
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:29,676
I don't have any money right

2442
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:30,010
now.

2443
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:31,011
I have $50 in my bank account,

2444
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:32,095
but that's what I would give.

2445
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:33,305
>> We'll see if that's worth

2446
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,097
my vote.

2447
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:36,016
Uh, Bob, you are a parent.

2448
01:21:36,099 --> 01:21:37,851
My own father taught me about

2449
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:39,686
taking responsibility for my

2450
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:41,813
choices, my decisions, my votes.

2451
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:43,148
You're giving ownership of

2452
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,441
your choices and your decisions

2453
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:46,902
and your votes to Charlie, to

2454
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,070
Corinne, to me, and what I want

2455
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,448
from you is one example of when

2456
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:53,283
you chose to be responsible

2457
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,826
for your decisions while you

2458
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:55,285
were out there.

2459
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:56,119
>> The occasion didn't come up

2460
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:59,789
for me to take control.

2461
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:01,166
I mean, I didn't need to.

2462
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,501
You people were making good

2463
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,169
decisions.

2464
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:05,587
There was no point in me

2465
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:07,005
stepping forward and saying,

2466
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,298
"No, let's not do that."

2467
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:08,840
>> Okay.

2468
01:22:08,923 --> 01:22:09,924
Well, this will be an

2469
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:10,508
interesting choice.

2470
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:11,843
That's for sure.

2471
01:22:11,926 --> 01:22:13,094
>> PROBST: Thanks, Marcus.

2472
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,389
Randy.

2473
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:20,310
>> Let me start with Susie.

2474
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:21,144
If 39 days ago, somebody had

2475
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:23,855
told me I'd be standing here

2476
01:22:23,938 --> 01:22:24,481
and that you would be sitting

2477
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:26,942
there, I would have told them

2478
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:27,317
they were crazy.

2479
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,195
You said at least once that you

2480
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:31,196
felt sorry for me.

2481
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,364
Just elaborate on that a little

2482
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,156
bit.

2483
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:33,615
If you don't know what

2484
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:35,283
"elaborate" means, that means

2485
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,785
tell me a little bit more.

2486
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:38,244
>> Just the way you responded

2487
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:39,120
to people or the way you talked

2488
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:39,871
to them.

2489
01:22:39,954 --> 01:22:40,830
And I just didn't understand

2490
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:41,247
that.

2491
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:42,123
And I just thought you're not

2492
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,583
happy.

2493
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:44,417
You're sad.

2494
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:47,170
And I genuinely really felt like

2495
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:48,672
I wish I knew how I could help

2496
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:49,339
you.

2497
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:50,090
It's that simple.

2498
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:50,840
>> Okay.

2499
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:51,716
>> I'm truly sorry.

2500
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,551
It was not meant to offend or

2501
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:54,761
hurt you.

2502
01:22:54,844 --> 01:22:56,846
>> Okay, I'm done with you.

2503
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,139
Um, Sugar, the night I was voted

2504
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:01,810
out, you proceeded to roll in

2505
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:03,103
the dirt, laughing

2506
01:23:03,186 --> 01:23:04,396
uncontrollably.

2507
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,022
Did you not know that I was

2508
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,232
going to the jury?

2509
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:08,608
Did you not want my vote?

2510
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:09,859
Did you just figure there's no

2511
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:11,361
way I'm getting it anyway, so

2512
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:13,530
I'll make a jackass out of him?

2513
01:23:13,613 --> 01:23:14,197
>> I don't think I needed to do

2514
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,282
that because you did that

2515
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:16,574
yourself.

2516
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:17,701
>> That's your answer?

2517
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:18,159
>> Yeah.

2518
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:18,743
>> That's your answer for a

2519
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:19,494
million bucks?

2520
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:20,578
>> Yeah.

2521
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,622
You were a jerk.

2522
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:23,248
You were a jerk the whole time.

2523
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,125
Sorry.

2524
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:26,126
>> Okay, well...

2525
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:27,711
You lose, too.

2526
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:28,670
>> All right.

2527
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:31,589
>> Bob, again, same question as

2528
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:32,507
I gave Sugar.

2529
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,217
Did you not want my vote?

2530
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,094
I mean, it was a joke on me.

2531
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:36,970
She laughed...

2532
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:37,679
>> Randy, it wasn't a joke on

2533
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:38,096
you.

2534
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,472
It was one of the few strategic

2535
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:40,640
things that I did.

2536
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:41,641
>> It wasn't strategic at all.

2537
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:42,767
You had the votes to get me out

2538
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,435
of the game.

2539
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,060
This is a chance right now for a

2540
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,979
million dollars, and please

2541
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:46,563
don't make me vote for Susie

2542
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:48,064
because she is the only one

2543
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:49,190
that didn't laugh.

2544
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,359
>> I was going to use the idol.

2545
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:52,402
I was going to bring it back to

2546
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:53,987
camp and let somebody see it,

2547
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,238
think I had the idol and

2548
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:57,157
protect myself from being voted

2549
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:57,323
off.

2550
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:58,241
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

2551
01:23:58,324 --> 01:24:00,994
I apologize.

2552
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:02,287
The only thing I can say is,

2553
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,580
I was absolutely outraged at

2554
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:06,040
Sugar's behavior, and I went

2555
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,959
back to camp and I was pissed.

2556
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:09,210
That's the truth.

2557
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,253
>> Okay.

2558
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:13,006
Whoever wins the million,

2559
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:13,798
spend it wisely.

2560
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:14,299
>> PROBST: Thanks, Randy.

2561
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:17,427
Matty, close it out.

2562
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,975
>> Susie, tell me why the two

2563
01:24:24,058 --> 01:24:26,352
people sitting next to you are

2564
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:27,270
less deserving of the million

2565
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:29,105
dollars.

2566
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:30,231
>> Between both of them, I'm

2567
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:31,232
sure I have faults, too.

2568
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,151
Apparently, I talk too much and

2569
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,360
I don't keep my promises, but I

2570
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:35,320
know this is a game.

2571
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,113
And so, Sugar, I really...

2572
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:40,158
I was very, very disgusted with

2573
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,659
what she did to Randy.

2574
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:42,368
That really upset me.

2575
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:43,411
Even though, you know, I feel

2576
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,705
Randy can be harsh sometimes, he

2577
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:46,873
didn't deserve to be humiliated

2578
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:47,415
like that.

2579
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:48,166
Bob, when I won the immunity

2580
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:49,709
yesterday...

2581
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,085
The immunity challenge, I was

2582
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:52,295
really disappointed in Bob when

2583
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:54,214
he congratulated me right away,

2584
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:55,131
and then we came back to the

2585
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,509
hut, and he got angry at me.

2586
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:58,676
He just snapped.

2587
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,386
And I was like, "Wow, he's

2588
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,304
really short-tempered."

2589
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:02,639
Anytime anybody's won

2590
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:03,348
an immunity, I've always

2591
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:04,057
congratulated them.

2592
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,433
I just felt that he could have

2593
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,227
felt happier for me because

2594
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,186
I did win it.

2595
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:10,480
I really did try and I did win

2596
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:10,647
it.

2597
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:11,356
>> All right, well, good job for

2598
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,149
making it to this point.

2599
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,359
All right, Sugar, I know you

2600
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,319
created this persona of

2601
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:17,153
yourself that's very innocent,

2602
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:20,406
but everybody here tonight

2603
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:22,575
knows that that's total garbage.

2604
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:24,702
I want you to reveal something

2605
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:28,122
that you did that was just evil.

2606
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:30,125
>> Kenny.

2607
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,168
I broke Kenny's heart, I feel.

2608
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:35,880
And I let him down.

2609
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,800
That hurt, and I'm sorry.

2610
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:42,762
>> That's all you got, really?

2611
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,597
All right, Sugar.

2612
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,307
And, Bob, basically, all I got

2613
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,685
for you, is why the two people

2614
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:50,270
sitting on either side of you

2615
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:52,188
are more deserving of the

2616
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:52,647
million-dollar prize.

2617
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:56,025
>> Um, I don't think they are.

2618
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:04,200

2619
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:06,661

2620
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:07,912
adventure with me.

2621
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,915
And, uh, good luck.

2622
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:11,916
>> PROBST: All right, jury,

2623
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,417
you've had your chance to

2624
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,294
address Susie, Bob, and Sugar.

2625
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:17,130
In a moment, you're going to

2626
01:26:17,213 --> 01:26:19,173
make a million-dollar vote.

2627
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:20,466
I'm going to give you a minute

2628
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:22,594

Jury, you have had your shot at

2633
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:40,278
the final three.

2634
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:41,529
It is now time to vote.

2635
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:43,615
Tonight you're voting for a

2636
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:44,616
winner.

2637
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,326
The name you're writing down is

2638
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:47,327
the name of the person you feel

2639
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:48,244
most deserving of the title of

2640
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:50,496
sole Survivor and the

2641
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,290
million-dollar check that goes

2642
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,208
along with it.

2643
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,002
For the last time, it is time

2644
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:57,086
to vote.

2645
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,213
Marcus, you're up.

2646
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:14,979
>> Susie, you and I were friends

2647
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,397
from day one, and we are friends

2648
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,733
on day 39.

2649
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,860
Spend it wisely.

2650
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,121
>> You did an awesome job

2651
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,456
surviving in Africa.

2652
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:34,290
I'm just not sure how the hell

2653
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:38,252
you survive in the real world.

2654
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,475

2657
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:47,030
Susie, Bob, Sugar, jury, to all

2658
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:48,823
of you, I say thank you for a

2659
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:50,867
great season of<i> Survivor.</i>

2660
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:51,451
And I will see you back in Los

2661

Susie, Bob...

2667
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:58,434
You look nervous, Bob.

2668
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,686
(laughing)

2669
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,106
And Sugar.

2670
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:05,108
I've got some votes.

2671
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:07,652
A jury of your peers has

2672
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,529
decided who they feel is most

2673
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:11,030
worthy of the title of sole

2674
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:13,950
Survivor and a million-dollar

2675
01:30:14,033 --> 01:30:14,575

01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:19,330
Tonight, you want to see your

2678
01:30:19,413 --> 01:30:19,539
name.

2679
01:30:19,622 --> 01:30:21,874
Usually, votes are bad.

2680
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,292
Tonight, they're worth a

2681
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:24,085
million bucks.

2682
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:27,255
It is time to read the votes.

2683
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:33,553
First vote.

2684
01:30:33,636 --> 01:30:35,096

2686
01:30:44,313 --> 01:30:44,522
Susie.

2688
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,945
One vote Bob; one vote Susie.

2689
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:56,701

2690
01:30:58,744 --> 01:31:01,706
Two votes Susie; one vote Bob.

2691
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,548
Susie.

2692
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:12,550
>> I can't believe it.

2693
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:13,134
>> PROBST: Three votes Susie;

2694
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:15,386

2698
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:23,895

two votes Bob.

2701
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:36,365
Bob.

2702
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:37,533
We are tied.

2703
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,285
Three votes Susie;

2704
01:31:39,368 --> 01:31:40,453
three votes Bob.

2705
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:42,246
If this last vote is a vote for

2706
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,748
Sugar, we have a tie.

2707
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:53,132
It is not a vote for Sugar.

2708
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,009
Let's go in tight on Susie and

2709
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:55,718
Bob.

2710
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:57,845
