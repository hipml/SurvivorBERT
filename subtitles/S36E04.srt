1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:04,234
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,714
In the Malolo tribe,

3
00:00:06,964 --> 00:00:11,186
a mix gave former 
Naviti allies a 5 -4 advantage.

4
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:13,555
It couldn't have turned out better.

5
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,391
And Bradley was getting cocky.

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,259
And they are entertaining. 
While we eliminate them!

7
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:21,596
The Naviti tribe 
had to face the council.

8
00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:24,171
And with Chris on Ghost Island,

9
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:28,586
were ready 
to release one of their own.

10
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:30,609
Do you want to take Angela out?

11
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:33,113
But the four Malolo 
saw the opportunity

12
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:35,009
to take out a major threat.

13
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:37,879
We can choose, Wendell or Morgan.

14
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,934
The four of us decide who goes.

15
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:42,717
At the council,

16
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:50,334
But they were taken by surprise

17
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,509
when Morgan was eliminated.

18
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,334
Morgan, the tribe has spoken.

19
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:58,633
I have the Heir Advantage.

20
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:02,334
I leave it to Domenick.

21
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:06,734
There are 17 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

22
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,734
What the fuck happened?!

23
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:26,528
Good game.

24
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:29,034
Good. You got me.

25
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,333
Do we talk about it a bit?

26
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:34,234
Not too much, no.

27
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:39,109
Let's say we decided to stay strong.

28
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:40,589
It succeeded.

29
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:42,334
This game is crazy.

30
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:47,148
Angela, sorry I voted for you.

31
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,409
The same.

32
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:53,526
Wendell and Dom betrayed me. 
I thought I could trust them.

33
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:56,424
But even 
if he wears a sheepskin,

34
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,860
below, a wolf remains a wolf.

35
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,709
Wendell, are we going for a walk? 
Comfort yourself a little?

36
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:06,634
Wendell and I 
had a neat little plan.

37
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:09,209
We were all going to vote for Angela.

38
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:12,809
But the old Malolo 
took me by surprise.

39
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:15,209
Yeah. We had a good time.

40
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,800
We got everyone back together.

41
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,209
That's crazy.

42
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,923
They succeeded.

43
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:25,109
And we're burned out with Angela. 
She wants us dead.

44
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:27,068
Chris still wants me dead.

45
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:29,609
And he doesn't know 
what he's going to get into.

46
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:31,309
It will be...

47
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:36,297
A total and utter disaster.

48
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:40,101
I am with you. 
At least there are two of us.

49
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:42,009
What do we do ?

50
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:44,434
I got passed, that's all.

51
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:47,534
But... Listen.

52
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:49,650
I have a real idol.

53
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:54,934
Mazette!

54
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,109
There is hope.

55
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,817
We may be at our lowest

56
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:01,726
but luckily 
my buddy Domenick has an idol.

57
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:03,634
Wow. That's great.

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,694
We have a chance to stir things up.

59
00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:11,309
Just as we left 
our group,

60
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:14,434
maybe someone 
will leave theirs.

61
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:16,534
It's playable.

62
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:20,409
We have to be 
as smart as possible.

63
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,478
We are fine, we can do it.

64
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:45,509
This morning, 
I looked at the bottom of my bag.

65
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:48,448
And... Damn it! 
There is something !

66
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:51,409
It can be good or bad.

67
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:54,514
The council did not turn out 
as I hoped,

68
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,634
I pray it helps me.

69
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,534
Oh my God !

70
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,909
Morgan, my girl! I love you !

71
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:08,609
The Heir's Advantage was given to me 
by my girlfriend Morgan!

72
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:10,196
Just... Oh!

73
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:12,036
A big moment for me.

74
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,508
"With this advantage, 
your immunity is guaranteed.

75
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,312
It can only be used 
when there are 13 players left.

76
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,509
or when there are six players left."

77
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,209
There, we are 17. Okay.

78
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,609
Any help is welcome.

79
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:27,912
I already have the idol, but I want 
everything I can get.

80
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,776
And there are lessons to be learned 
from these relics.

81
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:33,909
It is important that I 
truly reverse these curses.

82
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:36,675
I must not sink, 
be eaten alive

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,609
like those previous players.

84
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:40,334
Oh my God !

85
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:56,702
Over here, everyone!

86
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:07,586
Malolo, 
discover the new Naviti tribe.

87
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:11,334
Morgan was eliminated 
at the last council.

88
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,734
Shit !

89
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,034
And this is Chris, 
back from Ghost Island.

90
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:26,709
Chris discovers his new tribe.

91
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:30,934
Welcome !

92
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:39,509
Today 
you will have to collect a ring.

93
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:42,409
Then you will return 
to your flag,

94
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:46,521
the other tribe trying to stop you 
by all means.

95
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,678
The first person 
with one hand on the ring

96
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:51,192
and one on the mast

97
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:52,760
mark for his tribe.

98
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,977
Three points and it's won.

99
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:58,734
Like at home.

100
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,229
Peanut butter, jam...

101
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:12,609
Additionally, the winners will send 
one of the losers to Ghost Island,

102
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:15,909
who will come back 
for the next immunity test

103
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:18,960
and potentially risk 
the board.

104
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:20,034
Big stakes.

105
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,609
Malolo, you are one more. 
Who is not participating?

106
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:25,326
Not the same person 
in two events in a row.

107
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,385
So ?

108
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:29,865
Go to the bench.

109
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,433
One minute of organization 
and we get started.

110
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:38,773
First run!

111
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,797
Michael and Brendan for Malolo

112
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:44,234
against Chris and Wendell.

113
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:45,931
In place !

114
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:49,931
Well, on and go!

115
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,409
Survivors, ready?

116
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,509
Chris rushes off quickly.

117
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:57,632
He alone moves.

118
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,709
An interesting strategy, from the outset.

119
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,677
Chris quickly reaches the ring.

120
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:04,809
Go right!

121
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:07,234
Now comes the strategy.

122
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:12,709
Chris tries to throw, 
he passes to Wendell!

123
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,631
This is for Chris!

124
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:18,234
Wendell tries to block Brendan.

125
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:20,434
Chris can free himself.

126
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:27,434
Can we stop Chris? 
From the outset, it does not seem!

127
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:30,334
Naviti scores the first point!

128
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,833
New round. Angela and Laurel

129
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,234
contre Jenna and Kelly.

130
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:43,034
Survivors, ready?

131
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,734
Laurel goes ahead, 
looking for the ring for Naviti.

132
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,434
Jenna leaves to challenge her a bit.

133
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,646
Catch her, Jenna!

134
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,519
Jenna goes after Laurel,

135
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,409
attempts to grab the ring.

136
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,834
We have a water battle!

137
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,634
Voici Kellyn et Angela. 
Kelly's s'en prend Ã  Laurel.

138
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:11,065
Angela is on the ring.

139
00:08:11,682 --> 00:08:13,989
Everyone is struggling!

140
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:20,241
Laurel didn't give up,

141
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:24,434
not for a moment, 
although they all cling to her.

142
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,857
But she is trained!

143
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:32,009
Jenna puts the package!

144
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,109
We feel that it is rocking!

145
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:36,909
Laurel strikes back! 
Angela gives it all!

146
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,234
Angela's turn!

147
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:41,634
And she scores for Naviti!

148
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,769
New round.

149
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:53,709
against Domenick and James.

150
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:59,209
Naviti can win this time.

151
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:00,909
Survivors, ready?

152
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:06,088
This time, Sebastian 
rushes quickly for Malolo.

153
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,534
Domenick sets off for Naviti.

154
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:11,722
It will be a fight for the ring.

155
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:18,534
He steps aside and throws it

156
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:22,036
to Bradley, whom James retains.

157
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,934
The Malolo hold the rope.

158
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,909
The Malolo must score.

159
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,080
It fights dry.

160
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:36,615
Bradley et Sebastian

161
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,134
pull James and Domenick 
to their flag.

162
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:45,409
Can Sebastian and Bradley 
make it happen?

163
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:48,098
Rest marque !

164
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,346
Naviti can win this time.

165
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:07,381
Malolo must score.

166
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,417
Survivors, ready?

167
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:12,342
Go !

168
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,541
Come on, Laurel!

169
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,360
Laurel, for the second time, 
rushes towards the ring.

170
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,563
She draws on her reserves.

171
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:25,633
Stephanie arrives first.

172
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:28,134
It's a fight for the ring.

173
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:29,506
Des, to the left!

174
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:32,671
Do something, girls!

175
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,306
The Malolo 
must score now.

176
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:41,122
The Naviti have the advantage.

177
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:44,323
They are getting closer step by step

178
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,634
of the arrival of the test.

179
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:49,609
Laurel makes the difference 
for Naviti.

180
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,482
She is unstoppable.

181
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,194
Des, lift his feet!

182
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:57,634
No strangulation!

183
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:00,534
His feet !

184
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:05,041
Malolo gives 
Naviti a hard time! Libby is getting closer!

185
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:09,809
Stephanie pulls her back.

186
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:11,947
Laurel continues to fight.

187
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,846
Libby, a few centimeters away! 
For victory !

188
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:15,758
Go on !

189
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:17,207
Come on, Libby!

190
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,109
Lift his legs!

191
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:22,675
The Malolo are back!

192
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,925
Libby is trained!

193
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:26,893
Can she reach the goal?

194
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:30,034
And There you go !

195
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:33,162
Naviti wins the award!

196
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,709
Naviti, big reward 
and big decision.

197
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,909
Which member of Malolo 
will you send to Phantom Island,

198
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:52,309
knowing that he will return in time 
for the next immunity?

199
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:53,578
I believe we are going

200
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:55,909
follow the consensus 
and choose the stones.

201
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:57,463
The stones. Understood.

202
00:11:58,356 --> 00:11:59,426
Yeah.

203
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,467
My biggest fear in Survivor.

204
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:07,683
Really ?

205
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:12,682
Kellyn, if the spirits listen to you, 
you may go to the Island!

206
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,534
Palm up.

207
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,784
So. And... reveal!

208
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:22,434
Kelly's.

209
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,698
Stay strong.

210
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:24,794
Kelly's.

211
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:27,506
What just happened?

212
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:30,234
I opened my mouth, that's all!

213
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,288
None of us 
are here by coincidence.

214
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:37,049
We're all supposed to be here.

215
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,817
I have to be careful 
about the wishes I express.

216
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:41,869
Kellyn, get your things.

217
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:44,651
The boat is waiting. 
Off to Ghost Island!

218
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:47,834
You will return in time 
for the next immunity.

219
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,572
See you soon !

220
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,909
Naviti, big win.

221
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:57,634
Take your reward, 
go home and enjoy!

222
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:01,609
Malolo, nothing for you. 
Take your things and leave.

223
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:02,685
Thanks, Jeff.

224
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:08,001
Come on, Survivor gods! 
I knew they heard me.

225
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:12,934
I'm a little scared, but that's where 
I'm supposed to be.

226
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:29,176
It's my biggest fear here, 
to be alone on an island.

227
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:32,478
I can do anything 
with people to talk to.

228
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,603
I am an extrovert. 
My game is a social game.

229
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:39,213
But here, 
now that I'm alone,

230
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:42,678
I try to avoid being hurt 
by the idea of ââGhost Island.

231
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:44,803
I try to control my thoughts.

232
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:48,903
To just see what awaits me.

233
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:56,156
"Let the game begin! 
Follow the fire."

234
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:59,978
I see that a game awaits me. 
My mind is racing.

235
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:02,703
I get lost in the fire.

236
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:05,846
Not the best feeling 
I had here.

237
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:07,878
"The Ghost Island Gambling Game."

238
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:12,678
âI put an advantage in play 
if you bet your next vote.

239
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:15,678
Win and you will have power.

240
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:19,944
Lose and you won't vote 
on the next board."

241
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,478
My stomach is in knots.

242
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:30,155
There, in Malolo, there are 
five ex-Naviti and four ex-Malolo.

243
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,878
If I lose, we lose the majority.

244
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:36,478
Losing that vote is a huge risk.

245
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:39,395
Would the gods of Survivor have 
given me the white stone

246
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,778
if I wasn't supposed to 
come and earn that damn benefit?

247
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,678
In this game where one bad decision 
can change your life,

248
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,967
you have to follow your gut.

249
00:14:49,303 --> 00:14:51,978
How hard is that!

250
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:54,203
But I can't play this game.

251
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,379
I'll keep my vote 
for the next tip.

252
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:02,125
The whole idea of ââGhost Island,

253
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,878
it's bad decisions 
that haunt you.

254
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:08,078
So I wonder 
if I chose well.

255
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:09,603
I'm not sure.

256
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:12,337
If it comes back to haunt me,

257
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:16,958
I can live with it, 
because I did what I think is right.

258
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,878
It's crazy how fast this game...

259
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,250
... creeps into you, 
affects who you are

260
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,678
where you want to go, 
what you want to do.

261
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:29,703
I have been betrayed so often 
in my personal life.

262
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:34,376
So in the last two years, 
I've really changed my life,

263
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:37,603
trying to make the right choices 
by following my gut.

264
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,678
Barely married, I decided 
to end this relationship.

265
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:43,814
I branched off professionally,

266
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:47,778
went back to school, got an MBA 
and found a great new job.

267
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:52,060
If I hadn't followed my gut, 
I wouldn't be here today.

268
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,318
I believe in staying true to yourself

269
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:58,803
and following his gut 
can get you far in this game.

270
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,674
You have won us food, my daughter!

271
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:14,836
Health !

272
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,552
Welcome back here, Chris!

273
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:26,078
I was super cold.

274
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:30,049
When I was sent to the Island,

275
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:33,378
I had a plan in the works 
to take Dom out by surprise.

276
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:36,189
I'm eating this like I'm going 
to the electric chair tomorrow.

277
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:39,307
But they chose Morgan. 
So I have to understand

278
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,268
the truth about what happened.

279
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,646
Tell me everything.

280
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,278
Get rid of this guy!

281
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,287
My family slit my throat.

282
00:16:49,412 --> 00:16:52,878
None voted Dom. 
All three of us voted for me.

283
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:55,678
Clearly, 
they were aiming at me through you.

284
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,604
Wendell and Dom took aim at Angela

285
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:01,203
to take my power away.

286
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:03,131
It was a big mistake.

287
00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:09,778
And it will be Dom or Wendell.

288
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:13,478
It was an opportunity for me 
to join the Malolo.

289
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:19,865
Do you think he has the idol?

290
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:23,418
He showed us the fake one, 
with the shell and the string.

291
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:27,378
It's a string and a shell. 
He is the king of manipulation.

292
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:33,071
It's Chris versus Domenick. 
Between these two, it does not pass.

293
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:37,169
I like you, you, you and you. 
And I like myself.

294
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,003
Chris wants us to take Domenick out. 
He says he has an idol.

295
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,886
True or not, 
that's what he tells us.

296
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,575
Would we split the votes?

297
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:52,391
What ? Yes that's it.

298
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:54,520
Do you like Wendell?

299
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:58,253
More than Chris. 
I speak little with Chris.

300
00:17:58,503 --> 00:18:01,614
Do you prefer Wendell to Chris 
or the opposite?

301
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:03,678
I prefer Wendell.

302
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:09,478
It would be easy to follow Chris 
and take out Domenick and Wendell.

303
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:11,278
Working with him means nothing to me.

304
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:14,478
I don't want 
Chris leading the charge here.

305
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:18,005
Yeah, he's trying to dictate 
what we all have to do.

306
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:20,378
In real life, 
I was a student at Yale

307
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:23,637
and sportsman of the first division. 
I like to be in charge.

308
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:25,703
But here it is something else.

309
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,396
I played under the radar.

310
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,578
But I want that to change, 
to impose myself in the game.

311
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:35,334
I don't want you gone, 
or Wendell.

312
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:42,064
The problem 
is this whole thing with Chris.

313
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,178
I imagined him gone at this point.

314
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:46,071
He is always there !

315
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:52,499
I adore you and Wendell. 
I prefer to work with you.

316
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:56,278
Three is still a good number, 
with the right tools.

317
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:57,978
And I have a tool.

318
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:01,503
Mmh... I have the idol.

319
00:19:01,699 --> 00:19:04,978
So is it true? 
You really lied to us!

320
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,978
Yes. He's an idol. 
We're not supposed to talk about it.

321
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:13,276
I'm telling you 
because I want to play with you.

322
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:21,469
I think Donathan would vote Chris.

323
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:23,505
It could be Chris.

324
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,473
I want to target it.

325
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:34,482
Laurel flabbergasted me. 
She's here to play hard.

326
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:36,878
I thought I only had Wendell.

327
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:39,358
We now know 
that Laurel and Donathan

328
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:41,900
are willing to work with us 
to get Chris out.

329
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:43,678
It changes everything.

330
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,944
That's great. I feel alive again.

331
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:14,152
Over here, everyone!

332
00:20:27,504 --> 00:20:30,272
Good. Ready for 
today's immunity test?

333
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:33,704
First of all, Malolo, 
I have to take back the idol.

334
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,179
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

335
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:45,423
Today you will swim 
to a bamboo cage,

336
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:46,791
l'escalation,

337
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,804
dive down and release a door.

338
00:20:52,304 --> 00:20:54,261
Then you'll pull a heavy chest

339
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:56,707
to the shore 
and along a track.

340
00:20:57,304 --> 00:21:00,733
With a rope, you will hang 
the missing section of it,

341
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:03,404
Replace it 
and continue moving the chest.

342
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:07,679
On arrival, 
taking the balls in it,

343
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:11,612
you will try to place them 
on a very narrow perch.

344
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,349
The first tribe that places the five

345
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:17,358
wins immunity, 
is immune from voting.

346
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:19,179
For the losers: advice,

347
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:22,957
where a fourth person 
will be eliminated from Ghost Island.

348
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:26,460
Malolo, you are one more, 
who will not participate?

349
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,200
The others, a minute of organization 
and we get started.

350
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,704
Fine, here we go! 
For immunity!

351
00:21:49,304 --> 00:21:50,684
Survivors, ready?

352
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,804
It's a sprint to the cage.

353
00:21:57,904 --> 00:22:01,234
Chris and Wendell leave quickly. 
Michael, nice dive!

354
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:06,334
Everyone must be at the cage 
before they can climb it.

355
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:10,905
Chris and Michael 
reach their cages.

356
00:22:13,204 --> 00:22:15,555
Chelsea is there. Go ahead Malolo!

357
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:19,339
Go ahead, Naviti!

358
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,542
Now we have to go over

359
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:28,056
and start 
releasing the cage door.

360
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:32,479
Its good !

361
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:34,638
The Malolos opened the door.

362
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:39,000
They may start dragging 
the trunk, which is very heavy.

363
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:45,507
The Navitis waste a lot of time 
on the gate.

364
00:22:48,804 --> 00:22:52,047
The Malolos walked through the door. 
They are progressing.

365
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:57,572
I can't 
get my hands under.

366
00:22:57,697 --> 00:23:00,204
The Naviti are still blocking 
on their door.

367
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:04,504
It's a big lead, 
from the start, for Malolo.

368
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:12,184
The Naviti 
have finally opened their doors.

369
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,612
They can start 
moving the trunk.

370
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:17,904
Big advance for Malolo.

371
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,675
You have a good lead, come on!

372
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:26,727
Here are the Naviti, they are starting 
to find the rhythm.

373
00:23:27,204 --> 00:23:29,740
The Malolos 
put the safe on the track.

374
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:32,948
This is how we do it!

375
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:35,757
The Naviti reach the shore.

376
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:38,169
They strive to close the gap.

377
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:42,535
The Malolo are on the track. 
Now we have to catch

378
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,504
the middle section 
and bring it back to you.

379
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:49,237
On the first throw, 
Sebastian hooks the section!

380
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:53,779
Now, teamwork 
to place it and be able to continue!

381
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:56,478
So ! Its good ! 
No longer need the rope!

382
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:01,579
That's Naviti! 
You have to put it on track.

383
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:03,704
Otherwise, it won't work.

384
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:08,504
The Naviti have a string of setbacks 
in this event.

385
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:10,804
Huge advance for the Malolo!

386
00:24:12,204 --> 00:24:14,396
Put it on the platform!

387
00:24:17,304 --> 00:24:20,724
The Malolos undo the knots 
to release the necessary balls

388
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:22,379
to finish the test.

389
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:25,904
Sebastian and Brendan 
shoot for Malolo.

390
00:24:27,704 --> 00:24:31,379
Wendell tries to hang his rope. 
First throw: missed.

391
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,716
And one for Malolo!

392
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:36,479
You have to place all five.

393
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:39,721
Chris takes over.

394
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:43,792
Naviti has been struggling 
since the start of the race.

395
00:24:45,204 --> 00:24:47,084
And two for Malolo!

396
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,579
And another ! 
It turns to correction!

397
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:55,004
Naviti fails 
to cross this section of track!

398
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:57,237
It's good, Naviti!

399
00:24:57,804 --> 00:25:01,979
Naviti must place the section! 
Everyone is needed!

400
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:08,817
Two is impossible.

401
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:11,479
Bring the rope behind!

402
00:25:11,604 --> 00:25:14,355
So ! This time, Naviti is there!

403
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,679
Gently !

404
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:20,378
Brendan loses one!

405
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:22,904
This is the respite Naviti needs!

406
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,204
Get active, Naviti!

407
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:26,375
Ahead !

408
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:28,387
Let Sebastian shoot!

409
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:30,920
Brendan places third!

410
00:25:33,404 --> 00:25:37,032
Naviti has to hurry 
to open the trunk.

411
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:38,391
Come on, on the carpet!

412
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:40,849
Naviti has his balls, Chris rushes!

413
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:42,579
It's Chris and Wendell!

414
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:45,104
It would be 
a spectacular comeback!

415
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:46,727
Its good !

416
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:49,504
Calm. Even if they place some, 
everything is fine.

417
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:52,861
One for Naviti!

418
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,601
Brendan places fourth! 
Sebastian could win!

419
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:05,591
And two for Naviti!

420
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:08,104
Naviti closes the gap!

421
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:11,846
Chris up one 
but Wendell knocks one down!

422
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:17,604
Brendan shoots for Malolo.

423
00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:18,925
Go on !

424
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,362
Come on guys !

425
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:23,525
And four for Naviti! 
Here we are !

426
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:25,033
It's all here!

427
00:26:26,104 --> 00:26:28,930
What a comeback from Naviti!

428
00:26:29,704 --> 00:26:32,267
Everyone can win!

429
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:37,569
Just not!

430
00:26:38,604 --> 00:26:40,256
Brendan... There he is...

431
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,690
It falls!

432
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:47,004
Chris succeeds! 
Huge return from Naviti!

433
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:49,817
Naviti wins immunity

434
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,587
and send Malolo to the council!

435
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:55,804
That 
's Survivor-worthy celebrations!

436
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,578
Naviti, what a comeback!

437
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:14,204
Immunity is yours.

438
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:18,141
Survivor reminds you, 
again and again and again,

439
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:20,782
that you should never, 
ever give up.

440
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:24,579
Because as long as there is life, 
there is hope.

441
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,179
A superb ascent. 
No one will leave your tribe.

442
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:31,361
Take your things, leave. 
Enjoy your free evening.

443
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:34,900
Malolo, this evening, advice.

444
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:37,579
A fourth person 
will be eliminated from the game.

445
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:40,134
Take your things, leave. 
See you tonight at the council.

446
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:43,404
Thank god I followed my gut

447
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:46,541
and haven't played on Ghost Island. 
I still have my vote.

448
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:50,779
The original Naviti 
approach the majority council.

449
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:54,572
We just have to choose who's going to go.

450
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:12,144
During nine tenths 
of the race, we crushed them.

451
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,848
It was a good effort.

452
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:18,073
It confirmed what I knew: 
we are better than them.

453
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:22,073
We didn't win, but you 
were really good today.

454
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,673
Coming back from the event, 
it was dark.

455
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,248
But I couldn't help 
but smile,

456
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:32,373
telling me: "It's fantastic! 
We have the power tonight."

457
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:36,428
I try to play like 
a Boston Rob or a Kim Spradlin.

458
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:39,248
Someone who has a majority, 
has control

459
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:41,473
and just needs to get the situation under control.

460
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:45,273
Walking around the ex-Malolo 
seems to me to be the best tactic.

461
00:28:46,973 --> 00:28:47,973
Talk to me.

462
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:54,148
I know, but I would like to stay.

463
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:55,373
We will see.

464
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:57,073
We will see.

465
00:28:58,673 --> 00:29:00,773
I can't do better 
at this point.

466
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:04,148
Now, I don't think 
these five are going to break up.

467
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:06,420
So one of us four 
is leaving tonight.

468
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:10,155
And it's frustrating. 
I still have so much game in me.

469
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:18,999
Single mother, my worst fear 
is to disappoint my children.

470
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:21,348
So I hope to still survive.

471
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:23,748
But for now, 
it's not up to me.

472
00:29:23,873 --> 00:29:27,773
And it makes me sick that a guy 
like Bradley stays in the game.

473
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:29,943
Hope

474
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:33,773
I worry about how much time is left.

475
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,273
We should decide.

476
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:39,648
So, do they have an idol?

477
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:41,655
I don't think so, but be careful.

478
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,048
We never know.

479
00:29:43,173 --> 00:29:44,816
We need strength

480
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:47,221
but there, 
in case they have one...

481
00:29:47,377 --> 00:29:49,548
It would be safer 
to take one of the guys out.

482
00:29:49,673 --> 00:29:52,273
Yes, they will never see it coming.

483
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:54,085
We can not know

484
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,997
if the four original Malolo 
have an idol.

485
00:29:58,273 --> 00:29:59,707
We bet on the fact

486
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:03,048
that they'll think we'll want to 
stay strong and date a girl.

487
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:06,048
But we're going to take one of the guys out, 
because they won't be expecting it.

488
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:08,748
Even if they play an idol, 
they will miss their target.

489
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,673
So, we vote for Michael?

490
00:30:13,673 --> 00:30:14,948
Are you sure?

491
00:30:17,573 --> 00:30:20,595
I would say Brendan. 
They won't suspect it.

492
00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:22,570
Brendan is not dangerous.

493
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:25,348
He's docile, 
it's almost boring.

494
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:30,048
Brendan is an option tonight 
because he likes to play chef.

495
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:33,248
He's like a dad giving 
horrible pep talks.

496
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,073
It's okay with me. Let him be the leader. 
The boss never wins.

497
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:39,780
On the other hand, Michael is strong, 
and they won't see it coming.

498
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,579
I think of the smallest detail.

499
00:30:41,704 --> 00:30:44,348
That's why 
I'll be a great lawyer.

500
00:30:44,473 --> 00:30:46,673
We are all safe,

501
00:30:47,173 --> 00:30:50,324
Knock on wood, as long 
as we don't do anything stupid.

502
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,648
The group has decided 
to release strong people.

503
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:55,395
Michael and Brendan.

504
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:58,473
Two helpless penguins 
on a tropical island.

505
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:02,536
It scares me 
because I'm also a big guy.

506
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:05,238
But for now, 
I follow the movement.

507
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:10,473
Because these funny Malolo 
are completely soft.

508
00:31:10,873 --> 00:31:12,573
High five !

509
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:17,373
What do you think ?

510
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:22,648
I'm as paranoid as you.

511
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:25,032
I have the impression that for the sequel,

512
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,317
strength, they don't care, and...

513
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,048
At least we have an idol.

514
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:34,273
And so: what do we do with it?

515
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:38,473
We are badly off. 
But we have a card to play.

516
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:40,748
The idol we found.

517
00:31:40,873 --> 00:31:44,227
But if we play it tonight, Stephanie 
and Jenna have to find out first.

518
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:47,673
Otherwise, they will think they 
are kept out.

519
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,516
Good news.

520
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,333
And.

521
00:31:52,773 --> 00:31:55,448
Sworn. She's behind me.

522
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:57,148
Name of... !

523
00:31:57,273 --> 00:32:00,048
He's James' idol 
in Survivor China.

524
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:01,359
Oh my God !

525
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:03,948
We go from zero chance 
to 25% chance.

526
00:32:04,073 --> 00:32:05,901
Let's roll the dice. 
We will get there.

527
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:08,948
I was just meditating on hope.

528
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:10,704
Let's act!

529
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:14,361
What I will do with the idol

530
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:17,948
will determine my future 
and that of my allies.

531
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:19,913
It will be risky.

532
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:23,091
But I don't just want 
to protect myself for a few days.

533
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:26,173
We will need luck. 
The idol is not enough.

534
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:28,673
I'll take it out in full council.

535
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:32,273
I'll say, "I'm going to play 
it for one of us four."

536
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:34,485
Maybe 
one of them will turn around.

537
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:36,348
We have to vote for Bradley.

538
00:32:36,473 --> 00:32:37,873
You agree ?

539
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:40,348
I'll write his name 
on five pieces of paper!

540
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:41,948
Let's attack it!

541
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:44,548
Tonight is war 
between the two groups.

542
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:50,744
We have work to 
do to reverse the balance of power.

543
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:54,748
But maybe we could convince 
people like Sebastian and Chelsea

544
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,073
that they are at the bottom of their covenant.

545
00:33:01,473 --> 00:33:04,013
The worst mistake of all Survivor, 
for me,

546
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:06,272
this is James leaving with two idols.

547
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:09,423
I feel responsible 
for ending this curse,

548
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:10,648
to this heritage.

549
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:13,848
So even 
though it's a classic idol,

550
00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:17,773
I have a plan tonight: 
lie and expand his power.

551
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:44,528
If you don't have a torch yet, 
take one,

552
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:46,483
and light it in the fire.

553
00:33:49,783 --> 00:33:51,858
It is part 
of the council ritual,

554
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:54,358
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

555
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:57,483
If he disappears, so do you.

556
00:33:57,983 --> 00:34:00,454
Sebastian. First time on the board.

557
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:02,958
The Naviti seem to be in the majority.

558
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,191
Completely.

559
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,858
The 5 Naviti, we immediately knew 
what we had to do.

560
00:34:07,983 --> 00:34:10,283
And I think 
we're sticking to it.

561
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:15,035
Desiree. If there are five solid Naviti 
and only four Malolo,

562
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:16,658
was there discomfort?

563
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:18,558
Trop hit!

564
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:21,158
It's the only word that fits.

565
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:23,058
They know one of them is going out.

566
00:34:23,183 --> 00:34:27,758
Stephanie. Were there attempts 
to infiltrate the five Naviti?

567
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:30,558
Absolutely. 
But Bradley made sure

568
00:34:30,683 --> 00:34:34,583
to always know 
where his little allies were.

569
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:37,458
Bradley. Did you feel 
any irritation

570
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,655
when Stephanie 
said "her little allies"?

571
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,983
Yes, I felt it all day.

572
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:46,166
I understand their point of view, 
but that is what we have to do.

573
00:34:46,345 --> 00:34:48,338
I tried to talk to some,

574
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,383
like a babysitter.

575
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:54,067
Michael. 
He was apparently very tough

576
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,858
to identify a possible flaw.

577
00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:57,833
First, the five Naviti are welded

578
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:01,011
for their loyalty 
was not challenged.

579
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:04,758
But there are clearly people 
at the bottom of the ladder at home.

580
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:07,883
It's obvious, 
it's Chelsea and Sebastian.

581
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:10,983
Think about it. It's not hard to see.

582
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:12,883
Bradley is the point guard.

583
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:15,734
He made you all feel 
like a united group,

584
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,030
a democracy.

585
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:20,258
But if I'm Sebastian, 
I'm like, "Wait a second!"

586
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:23,058
Do you think Bradley 
wants to take you further?

587
00:35:23,183 --> 00:35:27,258
You're social, athletic, 
no way Bradley will keep you.

588
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:29,609
But we're an alliance of five.

589
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:32,354
We all get along well, we like each other.

590
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,858
And we all intend to play together.

591
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:37,283
Kudos 
for making them believe that!

592
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:43,058
Sebastian. When 4 people say, 
"I'm telling you, it's you two.",

593
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:46,658
you say to yourself deep 
down, "Mmh, that's interesting." ?

594
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:48,958
And how, how interesting!

595
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:52,108
Jeff, we knew 
they were gonna try anything,

596
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,958
but it won't take.

597
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:58,358
We are not stupid. We know that in 
war, when the other side wins,

598
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:00,068
you have to get your claws out.

599
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:02,483
It's a "them against us" mentality .

600
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:04,958
Desiree. 
Is it really that simple?

601
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,323
"Sorry, but that's how it is."

602
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:09,458
Yes I...

603
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,358
It could be as simple,

604
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,520
but tonight it's not.

605
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,555
He's an idol

606
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:19,683
of Survivor China. 
James's, actually.

607
00:36:19,983 --> 00:36:22,058
He had two in his pocket when he left.

608
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:24,658
And what's cool about 
this season,

609
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,058
I'm not going to read it all, but...

610
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:31,358
James has been cursed for 11 years, 
having played neither idol.

611
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:34,274
I have the responsibility 
to reverse the curse.

612
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:36,209
She has a double power.

613
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,578
She can save two people.

614
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:41,858
Double immunity.

615
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:45,486
I'm going to play 
it for two of us four tonight.

616
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:47,954
And I can say that the four of us

617
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:50,103
let's all vote Bradley.

618
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,728
If any of you want to join us, all 
it takes is one vote.

619
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:56,258
Two, even better.

620
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,658
I hope you will think about it.

621
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:02,258
Yes. It's hard to hear.

622
00:37:02,383 --> 00:37:07,183
I'm a little surprised to have become 
the big threat, the ringleader.

623
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:09,242
I don't have that impression.

624
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:11,683
But did I see it coming? No.

625
00:37:12,161 --> 00:37:14,758
Chelsea. 
It definitely changes things.

626
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:19,398
Yes. It's Survivor. You 
never really know what is going on.

627
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:23,365
Of course, 
that changes things a bit.

628
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:24,958
No kidding !

629
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:29,175
So Sebastian. Is it really 
just a roll of the dice?

630
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:31,352
I do not know.

631
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:34,112
Who can you last with? 
Big shots are respected.

632
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,458
We made it easy for you.

633
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:39,377
I challenge you: play the game 
you came to play!

634
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:41,083
I agree.

635
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:43,982
Chelsea, 
the hand is outstretched for you too.

636
00:37:44,183 --> 00:37:47,658
But I don't believe 
that if we changed sides,

637
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:52,149
one could advance socially 
and break the bond between the four.

638
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:55,858
You know, we're together 
because we don't have anyone else.

639
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:59,158
We're not a tight-knit quartet. 
We were forced to unite.

640
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:02,408
I'm making this offer 
to give you an alternative.

641
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:05,458
Sebastian. 
In the end, it boils down to:

642
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,083
"Who does the best reading 
in the other group?"

643
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:09,783
Pure instinct.

644
00:38:09,908 --> 00:38:12,460
You know, you have to consider 
all the scenarios

645
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:13,958
in her head.

646
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,358
Consider all options.

647
00:38:17,483 --> 00:38:19,358
This is how I play.

648
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:22,243
I believe tonight is the one 
you might think back to

649
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:23,669
once eliminated:

650
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:26,298
"Damn, I'm sorry I 
didn't!"

651
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,858
With that, it's time to vote.

652
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:33,583
Kellyn, over to you.

653
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:55,558
I never in my life 
heard a grown man

654
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:58,683
moan and complain 
as much as you do.

655
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:18,480
I don't know 
what just happened there.

656
00:39:25,883 --> 00:39:27,636
I will count the votes.

657
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:33,787
I believe it's Stephanie.

658
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:42,699
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

659
00:39:42,824 --> 00:39:44,597
now is the time to do it.

660
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:53,783
I play it for Brendan and me.

661
00:39:55,783 --> 00:39:56,976
In fact...

662
00:39:59,683 --> 00:40:01,183
I play it for Steph.

663
00:40:01,924 --> 00:40:02,857
OK.

664
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:09,158
This is an immunity idol.

665
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:12,083
Votes against Stephanie 
will not count.

666
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,731
I will read the votes.

667
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:22,083
Bradley.

668
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,820
Brandan. 
A vote Brendan.

669
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:51,164
Brandan. Four Bradley votes, 
three Brendan votes.

670
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:55,858
Brandan. Equality.

671
00:40:55,983 --> 00:40:58,224
Four votes Brendan, 
four votes Bradley,

672
00:40:58,349 --> 00:40:59,667
one vote remains.

673
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:06,712
Fourth person eliminated 
from Survivor Ghost Island:

674
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:10,116
Brandan. 
Bring me your torch.

675
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:20,960
Hold the pressure. 
You will find a way.

676
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:22,383
My God !

677
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,499
Bendan, the tribe has spoken.

678
00:41:27,883 --> 00:41:28,983
Thanks, Jeff.

679
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,140
It's time to go.

680
00:41:38,683 --> 00:41:41,588
It was a real Survivor duel.

681
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:44,058
Naviti wins this round, 
but the question is:

682
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:47,887
can this tribe get over it, 
to avoid coming back here?

683
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:50,700
Take your torches, 
return to your camp. Good night.

684
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:08,985
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

685
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:14,525
Next time in Survivor...

686
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:16,504
Build strong relationships...

687
00:42:16,629 --> 00:42:19,338
As long as she flirts with me, 
she stays in the game.

688
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:24,430
I bonded with Chris. 
I'm a bit in the middle.

689
00:42:24,865 --> 00:42:26,504
... will keep you level.

690
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,004
Is she there?

691
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,306
Go on !

692
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:31,904
Wow !

693
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:33,304
Bitterly disappointed.

694
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:35,704
It didn't turn out 
the way we wanted it to.

695
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:38,633
That's life. Sometimes we win, 
sometimes we lose.

696
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:40,224
But we defended ourselves well.

697
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:44,204
After 16 years of applications, 
it's a bit hard to swallow.

698
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:47,575
But an experience rarely 
lives up to the expectations we have.

699
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,304
This one was. It was awesome.

700
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:52,029
I am grateful 
for every minute spent here.
