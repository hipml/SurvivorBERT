1
00:00:02,827 --> 00:00:05,965
Sam said that you're the backup.

2
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:08,172
I need to flip the switch.

3
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:11,103
Previously onSurvivor...

4
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:13,862
We're gonna randomly divide
into two groups of six.

5
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:21,827
I think Lavo and
Gata... we have some

6
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:22,965
level of trust.

7
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:27,241
We are five Tuku strong.

8
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:30,586
So, we have
an easy vote out tonight.

9
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:37,931
This gives someone
the opportunity

10
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:39,344
to have safety without power.

11
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:42,103
All right.

12
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:43,965
It is time to vote.

13
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:47,068
Jeff?

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,827
"Announce that you have the
Safety without Power Advantage.

15
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:52,275
"You will leave
Tribal Council immediately.

16
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,965
You cannot be voted out."

17
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:57,034
Tuku five, you will
be turning on each other.

18
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:01,551
Seventh person voted
out of Survivor47: Tiyana.

19
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:07,241
The tribe has spoken.

20
00:01:22,862 --> 00:01:24,551
All right, well.

21
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:26,724
Coming back
to camp completely alone,

22
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:28,166
my head is just spinning,
honestly.

23
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,379
Like, on the one hand,

24
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:32,344
I am just breathing

25
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:33,586
the largest sigh of relief

26
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,068
because I'm here
and I'm in the game.

27
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:38,068
But at the same time,
it's not great

28
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:39,714
to have, kind of,
the spotlight on me,

29
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:41,103
and I hope that I didn't

30
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,206
piss anybody off.

31
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:46,827
I'm feeling
anxiety and relief, but still

32
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:48,931
nervousness.
But also,

33
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,242
there's a huge question
of who gave me this advantage.

34
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:54,448
- I know.
- Marco.

35
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:55,965
Polo.

36
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:57,360
- Rachel.
- Sorry, guys.

37
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:58,821
- What a move tonight.
- Oh, my God.

38
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:01,655
Thank you.

39
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:04,172
Tribal did not go good tonight.

40
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:05,925
You know, Rachel is
a very threatening player.

41
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:08,723
I was very excited
for her to leave tonight.

42
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,310
But she forced

43
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:12,586
the Tuku five

44
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,034
to cannibalize itself in front

45
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:15,931
of everybody at Tribal. So,

46
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:17,517
this was quite a disaster.

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,827
- Safety without Power is crazy.
- Yeah.

48
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,758
And it was,
like, a genuine shock.

49
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:25,310
Yeah.

50
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,028
I would love to know
where it came from, but

51
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:28,896
I'm just happy I had it.

52
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:32,000
I was the one who
gave Rachel the advantage,

53
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:35,413
and nobody knows about it
because I've been playing

54
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:37,448
this act out here
that I'm kind of goofy.

55
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:40,103
So, people don't that I'm really
a really strategic guy.

56
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:41,890
We moved back to Michigan.
My dad didn't want

57
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,097
to be in Thailand that far away
from us, so he moved to Texas.

58
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:45,793
But he owned
a video store down there.

59
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:48,131
- Just as immigrants. Yeah.
- My mom owned a liquor store. Yeah.

60
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:51,310
- Um, like, my...
- Why do all Asians always own a store?

61
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:53,689
I gave the advantage
to Rachel because

62
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:55,655
she was, what I felt,
in jeopardy.

63
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,241
Big, big trouble
at Tribal Council.

64
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,931
But also, genuinely,
there is a connection there.

65
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:02,758
And I'm working on building

66
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:05,034
the SSAs... Sol's Secret Agents.

67
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:07,655
When you got up and left,
they were all freaking out,

68
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:09,344
- like, "Oh, damn."
- Really?

69
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:10,551
Your ass was gone.

70
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:15,586
And...

71
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,166
Literally, the second
I found it, I was like,

72
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,103
- "It was Sol." Yeah, I knew it.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:20,724
Sol saved my life.

74
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:22,275
You know, in this game,
no one has

75
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,862
to help anybody else out,
but he was

76
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,344
looking out for me, period.

77
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:27,827
You have somebody now, okay?

78
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,511
- Clearly, I want to work with you.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:31,586
But I definitely don't
want it to come out

80
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:32,939
because that's a target on me.

81
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:34,689
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

82
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:37,172
I'm so excited
for this budding relationship.

83
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,000
I finally have someone
that I can look at

84
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:40,448
and be like, "I think at least

85
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:43,137
for now, I could trust you."

86
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:46,965
One million percent,
you were going.

87
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,517
They were all playing me.

88
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,586
It was very clear
that they were,

89
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,000
- like, planning on staying together.
- That's wild.

90
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:54,586
I know you had
a really hard day,

91
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:56,614
so I'd hate to tell you
how good of a day we had,

92
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,689
but we had a really,
really good day, and...

93
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,551
With Lavo.

94
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:04,862
Oh, my God. Okay.

95
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,655
You...

96
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:08,862
Well...

97
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,799
Okay, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

98
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,689
At this point,
I don't trust Tuku

99
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:16,413
as far as I can throw 'em.

100
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,379
So the Gata-Tuku War

101
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:21,206
is absolutely coming,
and I want to make sure that

102
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,304
I'm on the right side of
the numbers when it gets here.

103
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,517
Holy crap, dude.

104
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,172
- Kemo sabe.
- Hey, Mr. Miyagi.

105
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:45,517
Dude, some people on my tribe
have never seen The Karate Kid.

106
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,655
And I'm like, "Wax on, wax off."
They're like, "What?"

107
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:50,166
- I'm like, "No."
- Are you serious?

108
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,620
I'm like, "Please, no."

109
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,965
I like Sol.
You know, Sol might actually

110
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:56,482
be, like, my favorite person
out here at this point.

111
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:58,793
He's a jokester.
He's got a beautiful smile.

112
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:01,586
- Look at that.
- That's primo. That was one swipe.

113
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:02,965
One swipe.

114
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh! Ah.

115
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,965
Hello, hello.

116
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,407
Everyone, I have something
I'm really excited

117
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:15,856
to show you all.

118
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,200
I was going on a walk
for a little bit,

119
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:18,545
and I saw something
kind of interesting.

120
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,338
- I think we should all get going.
- Ah, field trip.

121
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:21,517
Lead the way, Caroline.

122
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:25,034
Oh, even the suspense
is killing me, honestly.

123
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,862
- Oh, my God.
- Get out.

124
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:32,724
- Here it is.
- Get out. Oh.

125
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,482
Y'all cool if I read it? Okay.

126
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:52,413
I see that word
"auction," and, like,

127
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:54,413
my heart explodes
and I can't believe

128
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:56,689
I get to be a part of, like,

129
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:57,994
one of the biggest
bucket-list items.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,206
Oh, my gosh.

131
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,482
Breaking news from
the islands of Survivor47.

132
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,448
A Survivoricon is back.

133
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:29,068
It's the auction.

134
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:32,137
The players are fired up,
running around the jungle,

135
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:35,896
collecting their money, ready
to go to eat some good food.

136
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:41,137
- Oh.
- Oh, nice!

137
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,344
Thank you.

138
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:43,965
Oh.

139
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,448
Oh. No. I'm so far.

140
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:54,517
I hate running, but, like,
I want food, so I need money.

141
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,137
So I'm just repeating to myself
the things I want to eat.

142
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:06,034
Yes.

143
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:08,068
Seems like the water wall
would be... Got one.

144
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:09,517
Oh, nice.

145
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,827
Hey, bro.

146
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,344
There we go.

147
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,103
Bingo. Bingo!

148
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,068
I haven't gotten
a single food reward yet.

149
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:26,137
Everything I've eaten so far
has come from the sand.

150
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:31,275
So I'm hungry.

151
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,931
Ooh. I'm gonna get some steak.

152
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:35,062
I'm gonna get a burger.
I'm gonna get something good.

153
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:37,758
Like, I want
to make this money count.

154
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,172
Dude, I have one.

155
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,827
Potato salad. Potato salad.

156
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:53,758
I got you.

157
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:55,545
It's like an Easter egg hunt.
I've been good

158
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,931
at Easter egg hunts my entire
life. I mean, my family...

159
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,784
we've had Easter parties
every single year.

160
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:02,241
Oh, yay.

161
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:05,586
And I truly, to be honest,
I didn't stop Easter egg hunting

162
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,862
until last year.
I was like, "I got to retire."

163
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:10,758
But I'm, like,
going hard out here.

164
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,931
Oh, my God. Sierra.

165
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:19,827
I'm live from
the islands of Survivor47.

166
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,517
We're about halfway through
the search for the cash here.

167
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,827
The players are all
going very nuts.

168
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:28,068
Uh, so far, Andy in last place

169
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:29,862
and Sierra,
a surprise early favorite,

170
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,862
racking up lots of dough.

171
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:34,965
Oh.

172
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,344
How's it going, Andy?

173
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:44,275
- Hold on. Let's see.
- I just need one.

174
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,896
I feel myself in a hole.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,200
A panic sets in, and I just have
to tell myself, like,

176
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:51,000
"Okay, I'm just looking
for tubes in the jungle."

177
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:54,275
I can do that. I have my eyes.
They work fine.

178
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:01,448
At this point,
I just have to laugh.

179
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:02,926
At this point,
I recognize what...

180
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:05,448
I'm on Day 14. Like,
this is how it's going for me.

181
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:07,260
I just want to make sure
I don't get zero.

182
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,793
No.

183
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,000
All right, we're catching up.

184
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,000
With more time passing,

185
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:17,724
fewer tubes
are gonna be available.

186
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:19,413
It's scary
because you can sort of

187
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,965
feel the time running out.

188
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:24,931
Cool.

189
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:27,551
And you really don't
want to be left without any money.

190
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,379
You don't want to be broke

191
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:31,442
at the Survivorauction
before you even get there.

192
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:33,758
Andy, that's it.

193
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:35,827
- We found 'em all.
- That's it.

194
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:38,655
And that's a wrap from
the Survivor47 money hunt.

195
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:42,931
Sierra comes out on top,
with Andy in dead last,

196
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:44,379
as usual.

197
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,551
Six, seven. $140.

198
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,586
- $340.
- $280.

199
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:54,137
Yeah.

200
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,649
For a guy that
only found two tubes,

201
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:58,103
I got, like, 580 bucks here.

202
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,413
That's more money
than I have back home.

203
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,689
I got 440.

204
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,335
- Six sixty. - SOL: Nice.
- Nice.

205
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,034
One thousand sixty dollars, bro?

206
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,482
I'm rich.

207
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:08,310
I'm rich.

208
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:10,137
I know. And who wants some?

209
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,517
Anybody?

210
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,412
Well done, Sierra.

211
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,965
Love that, Sierra.

212
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,034
Come on in.

213
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:34,931
Day 14 smiles.

214
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,724
Survivorauction.

215
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:39,689
And come on in.

216
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:43,034
We got room for everybody.

217
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,517
Let's have some fun today.

218
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:52,896
Welcome to the Survivorauction
for Survivor47.

219
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:57,482
This is a new-era auction,

220
00:10:57,586 --> 00:10:59,206
so let me remind you
how it works.

221
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,344
This morning,
you had a money scramble

222
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:02,896
where you raced into the jungle

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,931
to try and find various amounts
of cash.

224
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:08,241
The reason
for the money scramble is

225
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:10,304
you all start the auction
with varying amounts of money.

226
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,241
So let's take a look
at who got what.

227
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:18,758
All right, most money:

228
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:22,862
Sierra. $1,060.

229
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,241
And it goes down from there
all the way to Andy.

230
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,689
Good news is, Andy,
you're not gonna lose your vote.

231
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:31,304
You got to have
the most amount of money

232
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,304
- at the end of the auction to lose your vote.
- Yes.

233
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,965
You don't have any money.
Bad news is,

234
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,068
- you cannot bid on any items.
- Yup.

235
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:38,620
So let's get to the items.

236
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:41,758
We have 15 items
prepared for you today.

237
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:44,655
But only the first five
are guaranteed.

238
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,752
- Ugh.
- The additional number

239
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,965
of items
will be determined by me

240
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:50,482
drawing a random number

241
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:53,586
- out of a bag between six and 15.
- Wow.

242
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:56,000
The reason this matters is

243
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:58,206
the auction will end
without warning,

244
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,137
and whoever has the most money

245
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:02,275
at that point in the auction
loses their vote

246
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:04,000
at the next Tribal Council.

247
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,628
Let's see how
many items we're gonna have.

248
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,689
Okay. I know the total number
of items that's going

249
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,931
to be in the auction.
You don't.

250
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:17,994
- So that's been determined.
- Oh, my goodness, buddy.

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,413
The question is
how many items will there be?

252
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:22,827
- Okay.
- Shall we get

253
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,172
this auction going?

254
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,448
All right.

255
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:29,241
Oh, no.

256
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:32,206
- Ugh.
- First item.

257
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:34,862
First $60 buys it.

258
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:37,103
- $60.
- $60 to Sol. Come on up.

259
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:44,000
Salted potato chips,
soft drink for 60 bucks.

260
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:45,645
That might be the best buy
of the day.

261
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:47,241
- Yeah, I think so.
- $60.

262
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:49,097
- Ooh, want me to try this, buddy?
- Try these for me, Sol.

263
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,689
Oh, you got it, baby.

264
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,517
Oh, that's a big bowl.

265
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,683
- That's a big bowl.
- That's a big bowl.

266
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,103
That's a big bowl.

267
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:57,517
Oh, my God.

268
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,793
Yeah, buddy.

269
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:00,758
Ugh.

270
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:02,620
That potato chip
right there was so money.

271
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:04,433
- Enjoy.
- Thank you so much.

272
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:07,103
Attaboy, Sol.

273
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,097
- Let's update the board.
- Thank you, thank you.

274
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,172
Sol goes from $600 to $540.

275
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:15,379
All right,
shall we get the next item?

276
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:27,517
All right.

277
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,344
Next item up for bid:

278
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:32,000
mac and cheese.

279
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,724
- All my money. All my money.
- Oh!

280
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:35,793
- $640.
- Damn it!

281
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:37,235
$640. The first bid by Teeny.

282
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:39,655
Teeny, you're gonna spend
all your money on this?

283
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:41,068
I like mac and cheese.

284
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:43,448
- $640. Sold to Teeny.
- Ugh.

285
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,793
- Come on up.
- Yay!

286
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:46,137
Good job, Teeny.

287
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:47,551
Here you go, dude.

288
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:49,275
It's all right.
There's more coming.

289
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,275
- Dip in. Have a bite of that.
- Oh, my God.

290
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:53,586
That's a big bowl, man.

291
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:56,689
Oh, my gosh. Good, Teeny.

292
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:01,241
Worth the money?

293
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:02,545
- Absolutely.
- All right, take it back.

294
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,000
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

295
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:06,562
- Mac and cheese for Teeny.
- Oh, my God.

296
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:09,172
Wow.

297
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,172
Oh, my God.

298
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,103
Ugh.

299
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:15,379
If only she could share.

300
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:16,586
Shall I get another item?

301
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,106
All right.

302
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:23,137
I'm sorry, guys.

303
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:25,689
Okay. Okay. Oh.

304
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:27,821
- I think there's a drink in there.
- The question is

305
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:29,655
am I walking gingerly
because I'm worried

306
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:32,620
about protecting
an amazing reward

307
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:34,137
or am I walking gingerly

308
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,758
- to sucker you in?
- Oh...

309
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:37,580
That's the question
you're gonna contemplate

310
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:40,793
as you bid on this covered item.

311
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,172
- $360.
- $360 to Sam.

312
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:44,172
- $560.
- $560 to Kyle.

313
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,655
- $800.
- $800 to Sierra.

314
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,413
That's it. Sierra.

315
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:50,379
Sold for $800. Come on up.

316
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:52,752
- That's good, Sierra.
- See what you bought.

317
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,000
- Give me the dough first.
- Okay.

318
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,310
All right.

319
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:58,517
This is what $800 bought you.

320
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:05,724
Chips, salsa,
guac and a margarita.

321
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:07,310
Where do you want to start?

322
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:09,068
Oh, the margarita.

323
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:10,482
Oh, my God.

324
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:12,517
Cheers, guys.

325
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,103
Mmm.

326
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,407
- Don't spill it, now.
- Oh, no!

327
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:18,793
I am having a margarita
with Jeff Probst.

328
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:20,580
This could be you
if you apply to be on Survivor.

329
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,275
- It's, like, I want to just take a picture.
- Do it.

330
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:24,931
- Do a selfie.
- I know. I will.

331
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:26,614
Like, if I could
seriously just be, like...

332
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,931
Yeah, here we go.

333
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:30,620
All right, take it back. Enjoy.

334
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:35,034
Oh, my God. Look at that guac.

335
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:38,517
That leaves you with $260.

336
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:46,034
I'm using my best acting
skills -GENEVIEVE: Yeah.

337
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:48,131
- That's what I'm worried about.
- trying to sucker you into

338
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:51,000
not knowing if that's
a really great item or not.

339
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:53,442
I think we got
to keep it covered again.

340
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:55,482
- $80.
- 80 from Gabe.

341
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:58,551
- $560 for Kyle.
- $560 to Kyle.

342
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:01,620
- Going once.
- Uh, I didn't like your acting job, Jeff.

343
00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:04,034
I'll let Kyle, uh,
take the cover off.

344
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,862
- Let's find out.
- Hey, Jeff?

345
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,793
Uh, if there's meat under there,

346
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:10,313
Kyle's not gonna be able
to eat it.

347
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,793
Can I give you my $360

348
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:13,373
- on the shot that there's meat?
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

349
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,965
This is one item. No sharing.

350
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:17,620
Sold to Kyle.

351
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:19,275
- Go, Kyle!
- $560.

352
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,758
All right, talk to me

353
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:23,482
about the meat issue.
Sam said as long

354
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:25,407
- as it's not meat, you're good.
- Yeah.

355
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:28,068
So, that's... You know,
I've been a vegan for, like,

356
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:30,275
six plus years, and then
I switched to vegetarian

357
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:31,724
not long ago just so that way,

358
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:33,448
if I had the opportunity
to be here,

359
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:35,028
I could have more options
available to me.

360
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:37,758
That was part of why
you changed your diet,

361
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:40,517
was on the chance you might get on Survivor?

362
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,931
- Wow!
- Oh, my God.

363
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,338
- Ugh.
- It's very interesting,

364
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:45,137
everything you just said,
because

365
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:48,655
your reward comes with dairy,
and there is some meat.

366
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,310
Here's what you bought.

367
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:54,758
A giant tray of buffalo wings...

368
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:56,511
- Look at all those.
- Oh, my God.

369
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,269
...with ranch
and some celery and carrots.

370
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,172
You know, this is horrible.

371
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:01,752
Yeah.
So you're gonna take this back.

372
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:03,068
There's no sharing of items.

373
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,482
- Nobody can buy a buffalo wing from you.
- Okay.

374
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:07,378
I'll just take it all, you know.

375
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:08,689
- All right.
- Yeah.

376
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,068
I would have liked that.

377
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,378
Thank you, sir.

378
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,550
Oh, you're thinking about it.

379
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,786
Oh, my gosh.
I'm gonna do it.

380
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,310
If you're gonna do it,
let me see.

381
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,097
All right, so my favorite
was always the wing, right?

382
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,655
Oh, he's going for it.

383
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,097
This is a moment.

384
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:26,000
My heart's pounding right now.

385
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:27,482
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm...

386
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:28,614
Well, why are you doing it?

387
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,517
- I'm hungry.
- Okay.

388
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,537
That feeling like you're about
to do something,

389
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,586
and that something
might be wrong.

390
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,865
Good job, Kyle.

391
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,758
Yay, Kyle.

392
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:44,407
It's turned me into an animal.

393
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:45,827
How is it?

394
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,241
I'm a little d-disappointed
in myself for caving,

395
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:50,482
but if you're gonna cave,
this is a place to do it.

396
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,793
- Yeah.
- Good job, Kyle. - PROBST: Enjoy.

397
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:57,137
Kyle left with $20.

398
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,718
- Let me get another item.
- Oh, my God.

399
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:01,068
Look how many there are.

400
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:02,718
Well, if I had ever been

401
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:04,034
in Shakespeare in the park,

402
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:06,275
this is how I would do it.

403
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:09,034
Sir, I present
to you the most beautiful

404
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:10,689
of Survivorauction items.

405
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:13,448
I don't know what's in here.
If you don't like it,

406
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,655
I'm merely the messenger.

407
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:16,586
$660.

408
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:17,939
$660 to Gabe.

409
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,103
- Gabe buys it. Sold to Gabe.
- Go, Gabe.

410
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:23,620
- Good job. Good job.
- Oh, good luck, Gabe.

411
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:25,137
For all the money he has.

412
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:27,827
So the good news is
you can't lose your vote.

413
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:33,586
Well, if you're having
a bad feeling, you can trade it.

414
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:35,379
Oh, Gabe.

415
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,586
- Yikes.
- For this.

416
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:40,103
Yeah.

417
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,965
- Sticking with the fish guts.
- Sticking with the fish guts?

418
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:44,275
Okay.

419
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:46,034
What you bought was...

420
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:48,620
a very fresh... coconut

421
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,655
filled with very cold water.

422
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:53,551
- Oh, no, Gabe.
- All of your money.

423
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:55,793
Makes me stronger.

424
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,689
Sorry, Gabe.

425
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:01,655
Just like that, $660 gone.

426
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:04,034
From this point forward,

427
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:07,793
any item could be the last item,

428
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,310
which means
if it is the last item,

429
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:14,275
whoever has the most money after
that item loses their vote.

430
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:16,689
Sixth item in the auction.

431
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:18,655
- $380.
- $380 to Sue.

432
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,965
- $540.
- 540 to Sol.

433
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:24,344
Come on up, Sol.
Sold to Sol for $540.

434
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,655
He got the first item.

435
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:27,965
This is his second item
in the auction.

436
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:32,172
Take that from you.

437
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:35,620
This is what $540
bought you, Sol.

438
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,407
- Oh, you were right!
- Oh, my God.

439
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:40,827
A giant apple pie,

440
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:44,310
whipped cream,
which I will let you put on.

441
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:47,551
I got the wrong item, dude.

442
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:49,442
- Put the 47 on there?
- 47, baby.

443
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:50,925
- Doesn't have to be pretty. That looks good.
- Yeah.

444
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:54,793
- What's this?
- Well, this $60, Sol.

445
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:56,407
It's called the Survivor
cash-back program.

446
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:57,862
Some items come

447
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:00,896
with money that go back to you.

448
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,103
- So you will go back with $60.
- Right.

449
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,344
Before you do that,
take a bite of the pie.

450
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:08,482
Oh, yeah.

451
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:12,379
That's how you eat a pie
on Survivorright there.

452
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:15,034
- How delicious is it?
- Wow. - SOL: Oh, man.

453
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:16,689
Take it back.
Take your money back.

454
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:18,482
Enjoy.

455
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:24,689
So, Solomon is still in it.

456
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:28,137
If that was the last item,
Rachel, with $500,

457
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:30,235
you would have the most money
and you would lose your vote.

458
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:32,689
Okay.

459
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:34,338
- There is another item.
- Yay.

460
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:36,586
- Yeah.
- Yay!

461
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:38,551
Ooh!

462
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,275
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

463
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:42,896
Next item up for bids
will remain covered.

464
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,310
- $500, Jeff.
- $500 to Rachel.

465
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:49,827
Come on up. Rachel, out of the
possibility of losing her vote,

466
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,473
which may be
the most important thing.

467
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,551
$500. Thank you.

468
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:55,793
- What's your feeling right now?
- I have a feeling

469
00:20:55,896 --> 00:21:00,000
it could be bad, but
I also have a feeling that...

470
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:01,562
- It could be good?
- There might...

471
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:03,373
I might... For whatever reason,
when you came out,

472
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:06,137
I was like, "I think
there's a burger in there."

473
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:08,689
Wow.

474
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,137
How does this happen?

475
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:17,448
I feel like I should
take a bite, probably.

476
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,344
Yes, take a bite. Take a bite.

477
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,890
That's a
Survivorburger right there.

478
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,896
- Oh, my God.
- Get in there.

479
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,034
Oh, my God.

480
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:27,862
- Hey, Rachel.
- All right.

481
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:29,413
Take it back and enjoy.

482
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:30,758
Wow.

483
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:32,931
- Well done manifesting.
- Oh, my God.

484
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:35,103
- I just, like, felt it.
- All right.

485
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,689
Genevieve, at $440...

486
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:40,269
...you have the most buying
power right now in the auction,

487
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,206
if there's another item.

488
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,097
If there is not another item
and that was it,

489
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,000
you will lose your vote
at tonight's Tribal Council.

490
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:50,448
There is another item

491
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:52,620
- in this auction.
- Oh, my God. I thought

492
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:53,856
he said they're isn't. Sorry.

493
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:56,241
I'll go get it.

494
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:07,068
Oh, my God.

495
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,620
All of a sudden, I see

496
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:10,724
a tiny little piece of paper
in my fries.

497
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:14,965
And I'm just like, "What is it?
Has anyone else noticed it?

498
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:16,965
What the hell
could this be about?"

499
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:25,373
I'm sitting on the bench,

500
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,275
I'm eating my juicy,
delicious burger,

501
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,620
and all of a sudden,

502
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,103
I see a tiny little
piece of paper

503
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:32,275
in my fries.

504
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:33,482
Oh, my God,

505
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,103
Jeff put an advantage
in the auction.

506
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:39,655
But I don't know what to do.

507
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:44,965
Next item up for bid...

508
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:47,137
- All my money.
- All right, Genevieve.

509
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,586
Come on up.
Sold to Genevieve.

510
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:51,586
And I'm
just like, "What is it?"

511
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:52,890
You know, I can't just, like,

512
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:54,517
unroll it
and read it right then.

513
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,965
See what you bought.
Give me the dough first.

514
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:00,724
My heart is pounding,
and I'm waiting, and finally...

515
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:05,517
Everyone is
staring at Genevieve because

516
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,931
that's such a big moment.

517
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:08,413
Wow!

518
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:09,724
Genevieve.

519
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:11,551
So, I very slyly, like,

520
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:13,896
reach into my fries,
and I just, like,

521
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,241
go under and adjust my shirt

522
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:16,787
and stick it in my bra,
and I was like,

523
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:18,310
"I think I got away with that."

524
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:22,620
- Oh.
- Smells good.

525
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:24,028
Oh, there's, like,
a truffle in there.

526
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:25,275
Chocolate-covered strawberry.

527
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:27,379
All right,
let's update the board.

528
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,241
Now the person
with the most buying power

529
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:33,379
and the most risk is Sue.

530
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:36,034
So now, Sue, you are the person
with the most money.

531
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:37,482
It's the same dilemma.

532
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,758
At some point,
this auction is going to end,

533
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:42,896
and if it does, right now,

534
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,862
you will not vote
at the next Tribal Council.

535
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:47,206
Sue,

536
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,655
you will...

537
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:51,655
have a shot at another item.

538
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:54,137
Oh, my God.

539
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:56,862
- Wow.
- Jeff, I love you.

540
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,758
Oh, my God.
Look how big that is.

541
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:02,269
- It's a pizza?
- Maybe it's a pizza.

542
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,925
- It's probably a pizza. Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

543
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:07,344
Let me start
by showing you the item.

544
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,752
- Oh.
- We call this

545
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:12,551
the SurvivorOutwit, Outplay,

546
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:15,241
Outbreakfast
Sunrise Spectacular.

547
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:18,586
Everything you could want
from a breakfast.

548
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:21,965
But this item is not gonna go
to the highest bidder.

549
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:24,551
Sorry, Sue.
This item comes with a price.

550
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:27,068
The price is $200.

551
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:30,482
Anybody who wants a shot
at earning this

552
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:32,724
can declare their $200
right now.

553
00:24:32,827 --> 00:24:34,931
You will come up here
and compete for it.

554
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:37,482
- I'm in.
- Sue is in at $200.

555
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:38,793
Sierra's in.

556
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,482
- I'll go, Jeff.
- Sam is in.

557
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:43,206
Caroline in. All right,
everybody, who's in,

558
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,448
come up...
Sam, Caroline, Sue and Sierra.

559
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,724
What do you think it is?
What do they have to do?

560
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:50,586
We're about to see.
I have no clue.

561
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,896
So, Sue, Sam, Caroline, Sierra,

562
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,379
I can't think of a better way
to earn this

563
00:24:56,482 --> 00:24:58,758
- than a Survivorclassic.
- What is it?

564
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,586
Oh, my God.

565
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:07,310
Two grubs.

566
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,172
This is how it's gonna work.

567
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,724
The first person

568
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:13,482
to get down two grubs
earns this breakfast,

569
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:15,758
and I keep your money.

570
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:18,896
I'm gonna bring you
some freshies.

571
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:23,586
Oh, they're huge.

572
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,379
Do it.

573
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,551
Ew!
Mine's crawling off the plate.

574
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:30,137
- Thanks, Sam.
- I, uh...

575
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:32,241
All right.

576
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:33,761
Sierra, take your money,
head back.

577
00:25:35,103 --> 00:25:36,758
Sierra's gonna take her seat.

578
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:39,172
We are down to three.

579
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,925
All right, you ready to begin?

580
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:43,172
Here we go.

581
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,965
Three, two, one, go.

582
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:49,413
First to get two down
and show me an empty mouth.

583
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:51,793
Sam does one quickly.

584
00:25:52,793 --> 00:25:54,827
Sue spitting hers back out.

585
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:56,545
You got to keep most of it in,
Sue, for it to count.

586
00:25:56,551 --> 00:25:58,034
Caroline working on hers.

587
00:25:58,137 --> 00:26:00,000
- Sam has it! Both done!
- Yay!

588
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:01,758
Sam wins.

589
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:05,482
Sue spits it back out.
Caroline seemed to enjoy it.

590
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:08,103
Nice effort from everybody.

591
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:10,758
Caroline, you will take
your $200 back.

592
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,137
- Sue, I'm sorry. You get your $200 back.
- Ugh.

593
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:15,758
Sam, I will keep your $200.

594
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:19,413
- Blueberry pancakes.
- This thing looks ridiculous.

595
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:21,206
Fresh from the Survivorkitchen.

596
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,000
It is ridiculous.

597
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,344
- Attaboy.
- Yay.

598
00:26:25,448 --> 00:26:28,034
Sam spends $200 of his money,

599
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:30,551
and Sue with the most money.

600
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,758
That was... not the last item.

601
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:34,275
What?!

602
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,310
Next item...

603
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,103
Come on up.

604
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:40,482
I did it!

605
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:43,034
- Yes, yes, yes!
- A giant Survivorburrito

606
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:46,103
and iced tea.

607
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:48,620
Mmm, mmm,
mmm. Thank you, Jeff.

608
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:51,103
Next item.

609
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:52,724
I'm doing $280.

610
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,511
- All right, come up.
- Go, Caroline! - All right.

611
00:26:54,517 --> 00:26:56,655
The good news is, with no money,

612
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:58,304
- you can't lose your vote.
- You're right.

613
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,172
Bad news?

614
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:03,075
Fish eyes.

615
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:05,137
Oh!

616
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:11,241
Wow.

617
00:27:11,344 --> 00:27:13,206
That's how you do it
on Survivor, Caroline.

618
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:17,655
Item number 12.

619
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:19,827
- $260.
- Sierra, come on up.

620
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,482
See what you bought.

621
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:24,586
You are going to...

622
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:25,689
share.

623
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:28,137
You and two other players
will have

624
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:30,310
three minutes to eat.

625
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:32,896
Gabe and
Caroline, come up and join me.

626
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,206
All right, let's do it.

627
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,965
Big handfuls of peanut butter,

628
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:39,068
chunks of chocolate.

629
00:27:39,172 --> 00:27:41,464
This is one of my favorite
things to watch on this show.

630
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:42,689
Oh, I'm going back in.

631
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:44,655
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah!

632
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:49,517
That is it.
This item is over.

633
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,896
Oh, good job.

634
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,137
Well done.

635
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:55,862
An impressive attack on
the peanut butter and chocolate.

636
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,275
Well done. Well done.

637
00:27:57,379 --> 00:27:59,172
Here's where we stand now.

638
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:02,310
Sam is in the lead right now
at $160.

639
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:06,206
So, Sam, if that was
the last item, $160 means

640
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,620
you will not vote
at the next Tribal Council.

641
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:13,448
That was the last item
of the auction.

642
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:16,275
The Survivorauction is over.

643
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:18,241
Grab your stuff and head out.

644
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:19,551
Survivorcontinues.

645
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:21,827
Thank you... so much.

646
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:23,827
- So good.
- So good.

647
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:33,476
Okay, the players
are still walking off,

648
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:36,482
but if the auction looks fun,
apply to be on Survivor.

649
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:45,407
That was so fun, guys.

650
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:47,206
Congrats on
the spicy marg, dude.

651
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,724
- Oh, my God.
- That lost vote

652
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:51,931
just had-had my name
over it all day.

653
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:53,925
And I'm like, "I'll do anything
not to lose my vote."

654
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:55,683
- I know, I know.
- And then, it just... it kept following me.

655
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:57,896
I'm so sorry, too,
'cause I was right above you.

656
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,250
It sucks losing your vote.

657
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:00,655
Your vote is

658
00:29:00,758 --> 00:29:02,137
your voice in the game.

659
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,206
And now, with 11 people left,

660
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,413
I can't say,
"You got my vote, man."

661
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:10,586
I just have to say,
"Sure, you have my blessing."

662
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:16,241
At the auction,
inside the fries was a note

663
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:18,551
that I desperately want to read,
but I'm very scared

664
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:21,000
to take out because
there's people everywhere.

665
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:23,028
But I finally get a moment
where I'm going to check

666
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:25,137
on my clothes
at the clothesline,

667
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:27,344
and I have a moment to myself.

668
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,206
Oh, my God. Okay.

669
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,649
Wish I would have known that
last night

670
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:36,275
when I was alone in the shelter.

671
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:37,931
Oh, my God.

672
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:39,344
This is the auction jackpot.

673
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:41,103
Like, I couldn't
have scored better.

674
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:44,068
I have been down and out
Tribal after Tribal.

675
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:45,896
So an idol would give me

676
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,338
the most power
that I could possibly have

677
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:48,655
in this game right now.

678
00:29:48,758 --> 00:29:51,620
But there's two tarps
at this camp.

679
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,649
Is it at the top? Am I gonna
have to, like, climb a tree

680
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:55,310
to get to the corner
of this tarp?

681
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,206
My mind is just going nuts.

682
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,413
So, I walk by it
and kind of do, like, a...

683
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:02,620
a little corner check
and I see a tiny little lump

684
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:04,793
in the corner of the tarp.

685
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:07,000
Definitely it.
There's something in there,

686
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:08,827
but my brain is

687
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:11,275
reeling on how I'm ever
gonna get this idol.

688
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:13,344
I can't just, like,
slash the tarp,

689
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:15,827
because there are people at camp

690
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:19,206
at all times, like,
mingling around the shelter.

691
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:22,586
I want you to try
and braid my hair for funsies.

692
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:26,310
I'm thinking business
on the sides, party in front.

693
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:28,103
Sam and I... we are, like,

694
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:30,793
a very strong alliance
and, like, a duo out here.

695
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,310
So him losing his vote...
it's a little scary

696
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:34,862
at this time in the game.

697
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:37,689
We know we have four members
of Gata, but obviously,

698
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:39,137
you think of the numbers.

699
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:40,827
We need to recruit more.

700
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:43,344
And it just came naturally
with Lavo.

701
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:45,724
Like, I feel great with them,
I feel great connections.

702
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:48,000
So let's work together

703
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:49,482
and knock out Tuku one by one.

704
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,551
I think we have
all formed, like,

705
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:53,931
a great bond with all
of you, like, from Lavo.

706
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:55,931
Like, you, Sol

707
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:57,545
- and, um, Genevieve.
- Genevieve.

708
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,959
So it's, like, I don't want

709
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:00,758
to break any of that right now.

710
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:02,551
What, uh, so, what's our plan?

711
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:04,206
Are we just Lavo and Gata?

712
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,580
- I would love that.
- I know. I think right now,

713
00:31:06,586 --> 00:31:08,166
we're like,
"Let's just knock out Tuku."

714
00:31:08,172 --> 00:31:10,338
Well, there is a part of me,
also, that would love to,

715
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:11,724
you know,
if we're getting Tukus,

716
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:13,275
for it to be the male Tukus.

717
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,689
I think if Kyle loses
in an immunity challenge,

718
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:18,043
- like, that has to be our first target.
- Yeah.

719
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:23,482
I think the Gata and the Lavo

720
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:26,517
people have kind of formed
this alliance together.

721
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,206
And the name

722
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,448
that we're all throwing around
right now is Kyle

723
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:32,862
because he's won the past two
individual immunities.

724
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:37,310
So, if Kyle loses
the next challenge,

725
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:38,551
he'd be the easy decision.

726
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:41,724
I want to catch you and Caroline

727
00:31:41,827 --> 00:31:44,517
specifically up on yesterday,
and I'd love, if you don't mind,

728
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,448
to catch up on what I missed
with you guys. Um...

729
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:49,545
You didn't miss much.
We were so focused on...

730
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:51,241
- Was it gonna be Rachel?
- Yeah.

731
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:53,620
Yeah. That would have been good.

732
00:31:53,724 --> 00:31:55,965
Right now, I believe

733
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:58,620
Teeny is trying to work
with the former Gata members.

734
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:00,344
We all know

735
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:03,103
they're so charismatic,
they're so big and strong.

736
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:06,068
But they are the most dangerous
to me on this beach.

737
00:32:06,172 --> 00:32:09,448
So, I'd like to shake things up
and steer the next vote

738
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:11,137
towards one
of the former Gata members.

739
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:12,658
I think Sam is charming.

740
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,304
But I do not want to sit
with him at the end.

741
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,620
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

742
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:18,099
But I'd like to keep some
of those obvious targets around.

743
00:32:19,862 --> 00:32:21,071
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

744
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:22,476
I don't know how
you guys feel about that,

745
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,793
but I'm almost inclined to...

746
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,827
target, like, Rachel over Sam.

747
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:29,275
Yes.

748
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:31,586
Genevieve is a smart cookie.

749
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:34,758
She is planting the seeds
for a big move against Gata.

750
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:36,821
And I'm like, "Damn,
that's what I wanted to do."

751
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:39,310
That's exactly what
I wanted to do. Go, Genevieve.

752
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:45,338
- It's more under the radar.
- Yes. It's more

753
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:46,689
under the radar.

754
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:52,689
Genevieve and I see

755
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:55,085
Gatas are way too charismatic
and have way much control,

756
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,862
and one of them has to go.

757
00:32:56,965 --> 00:33:00,000
Sam is an obvious choice, but

758
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,724
Rachel is the sneaky,
dangerous one.

759
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:04,655
I was, like, scratching my hand.

760
00:33:04,758 --> 00:33:07,241
I thought I was so tan, and then
I just scratched it off,

761
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:09,517
- and I'm pale.
- It's just dirt.

762
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,793
I really want to get the idol.

763
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:16,000
Unfortunately, this camp has not
been empty since I got the clue.

764
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:17,448
But there was this point

765
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:19,931
where almost everybody was
in the shelter.

766
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:21,344
They were all chitchatting,

767
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:23,931
and I was like,
"I think this is my chance."

768
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:27,034
I am looking around,

769
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:29,034
trying not to look suspicious.

770
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:30,793
I don't want anybody
to know about it.

771
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:32,271
I want that power
to stay with me.

772
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,689
I don't want it to be exposed.

773
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:38,137
I flipped up the edge
of the tarp so I could do it

774
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:40,896
from underneath so no one
could see that it was ripped.

775
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,620
Oh, oh, oh.

776
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:44,448
My heart is racing.

777
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:46,551
I'm freaking out.
I'm trying to get through it.

778
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:48,448
I don't know how long
it's gonna take.

779
00:33:57,724 --> 00:33:59,586
Oh, my God. I got it.

780
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:01,413
Look at this guy.

781
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:03,034
Survivorbucket list.

782
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:05,068
I genuinely can't believe
I pulled it off

783
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:08,793
in broad daylight
in front of a lot of people.

784
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,516
Last night, I was seconds
from being voted out, and now,

785
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,447
I'm holding a... an idol
that nobody knows about.

786
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:20,103
That is the epitome of, like,
aSurvivor turnaround.

787
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:35,585
Come on in.

788
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:46,172
Survivor47 down to 11.

789
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:50,172
Who will survive
to make it to ten?

790
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,585
All right.

791
00:34:54,688 --> 00:34:56,438
Shall we get to today's
immunity challenge?

792
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:58,338
- Oh, yeah. - Yes.
- First things first.

793
00:34:58,344 --> 00:35:01,965
For the second time, Kyle,
got to take back the necklace.

794
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:05,862
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

795
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,137
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

796
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,200
For today's challenge, you're
gonna hold on to a handle

797
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:17,517
connected to a bucket
containing 25%

798
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,206
of your pregame body weight.

799
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,758
As your hands fatigue,

800
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:22,310
that bucket's gonna lower.

801
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:25,586
When it finally drops
and breaks your tile,

802
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:27,896
you're out.

803
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,172
Good news is

804
00:35:29,275 --> 00:35:32,482
men and women
have won this challenge.

805
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:34,551
Better news is
one of each will win today.

806
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:37,413
Oh, my God.

807
00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:39,448
The last woman left standing

808
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:42,517
and the last man left standing

809
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,965
-will win immunity,
-Wow.

810
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:47,379
guaranteed a spot
in the final ten.

811
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:49,379
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody

812
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,379
will be
the eighth person voted out

813
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,931
of Survivor47 and become
the first member of our jury.

814
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:57,655
Big stakes. We'll draw
for spots, we'll get it on.

815
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:59,586
Here we go.

816
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:08,448
All right, everybody,
grab your handles.

817
00:36:09,482 --> 00:36:12,344
And pull it back toward you.
You'll hear some clicking.

818
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:19,586
This challenge is on.

819
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:21,724
Oh, my gosh.

820
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:23,620
I already feel slippy.

821
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,862
You are now holding a quarter

822
00:36:25,965 --> 00:36:28,517
of your pregame body weight.

823
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,965
The good news is,
your odds are a lot better

824
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:33,137
with one man and one woman.

825
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:37,758
But still, this requires
a lot of willpower.

826
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,965
And already, Sam is struggling.

827
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:43,827
Come on, Sam.

828
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:45,379
Sam, you got it.

829
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:46,821
Genevieve
starting to drop a little bit.

830
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:49,000
Stop.

831
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,758
Sam trying to hold on.

832
00:36:51,862 --> 00:36:54,586
Not looking good.

833
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:56,482
Sam, slowly...

834
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:58,753
Sam is the first person out.
Right behind, Genevieve.

835
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:00,896
Come over and take a spot
on the bench.

836
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,758
One man, one woman out.

837
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:05,793
Odds just got a little better.

838
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:10,137
- Oh.
- Now it's Teeny who's struggling.

839
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:12,275
Teeny drops.

840
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:13,896
- Teeny's out.
- Damn.

841
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,718
We're less than
one minute into this challenge.

842
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:17,206
Three people already out.

843
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,931
Four women left, four men left.

844
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:30,551
Sue looking good.

845
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:33,517
Rachel looks like
she's in a trance.

846
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:38,034
- Damn, I must have been heavy.
- Well, you have been

847
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:40,586
playing Survivorfor 15 days
on very little food.

848
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,655
No!

849
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:48,407
- No!
- Little bit of movement now from Sierra.

850
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:51,241
There it is. Sierra's out.

851
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,206
Gabe adjusting now.

852
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:58,758
Gabe trying to wrench it
back up. Can he do it?

853
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:00,241
Gabe. No.

854
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,787
Gabe is out.
Take a spot on the bench.

855
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:05,724
We are down to three men
and three women.

856
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,931
Two immunity necklaces
on the line, one for each.

857
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:12,000
Caroline readjusting again.
That bucket dropping.

858
00:38:12,103 --> 00:38:14,172
Can Caroline get it back up?

859
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:15,724
She's trying to make a move.

860
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,655
Nice work, Caroline.

861
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:20,967
Nice work, Caroline.
Push through. You got it.

862
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,103
Caroline
holding it off right now.

863
00:38:24,206 --> 00:38:26,689
You never know
when someone else is gonna drop.

864
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:30,586
25% of your pregame body weight

865
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:32,310
is a lot.

866
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:34,586
Sol dropping a little bit.

867
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:37,003
Caroline fighting
to hang in there.

868
00:38:37,103 --> 00:38:39,862
Sol fighting to hang in there.

869
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:50,743
- Caroline's out.
- Come on, Rach.

870
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:53,379
It is Sue and Rachel
in a showdown for the women.

871
00:38:53,482 --> 00:38:55,172
It is Sol,

872
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:57,517
Andy and Kyle for the men.

873
00:38:58,862 --> 00:39:00,279
Rachel giving everything
she's got,

874
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,827
trying to wrench that back up.

875
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:08,476
But it continues
to lower inch by inch.

876
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:10,379
- There she goes!
- Nice, Rach.

877
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,566
Rachel pulling it
back up now. - Yes!

878
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:13,827
Nice, Rachel.

879
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,172
Rachel settles back in now.

880
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,275
- Ugh!
- You got it, Sol. Fight!

881
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:21,000
Sol digging in,

882
00:39:21,103 --> 00:39:22,379
but continues to drop.

883
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,448
Rachel is now moving, Sue is
locked in right next to her.

884
00:39:35,758 --> 00:39:37,862
Sol is out.
We're down to two men

885
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:40,413
and two women.

886
00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:42,413
It is Sue and Rachel.

887
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:48,482
Rachel's out. Sue,
you've won individual immunity.

888
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,655
You're good.

889
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,655
Nice going,
Andy! Come on, Andy!

890
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,344
We're now looking for one more.
It is Andy versus Kyle.

891
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,620
Kyle's won it twice.

892
00:40:00,724 --> 00:40:03,620
Andy would like
to break that streak right now

893
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:05,517
and be safe tonight at Tribal.

894
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:09,275
You can't drop now.

895
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:11,724
Dig in. Find that gear
you're looking for.

896
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:16,241
Bleed, whatever it takes
to stay in this.

897
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,896
Come on, Andy.

898
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,275
Andy digging back in.

899
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:27,689
Gonna try to wrench it back up.
Can he do it?

900
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:30,586
- No way. - SOL: Nice job, dude.
- And he is.

901
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:34,344
Andy getting that bucket
back up there.

902
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:37,413
Uses a little strength
to do that.

903
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:41,551
It gives you a little
more margin for a slip later.

904
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,310
Ow.

905
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:47,206
Kyle's dropped a little bit.

906
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:50,586
Andy now dropping again.

907
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:56,586
Andy trying to pull it back up.
Can he do it?

908
00:40:56,689 --> 00:40:59,620
- There's a little bit of yes.
- Yes, you can. - Come on, Andy.

909
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,724
Still dropping.

910
00:41:09,862 --> 00:41:12,137
Andy drops,
Andy's out of the challenge.

911
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:15,689
Kyle wins his third

912
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:17,028
individual immunity challenge,

913
00:41:17,034 --> 00:41:19,758
safe tonight
at Tribal Council with Sue.

914
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:21,172
Nice, Kyle.

915
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:22,931
Wow. Great showdown.

916
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:24,827
Great effort by everybody.

917
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:26,862
That is not an easy challenge.

918
00:41:26,965 --> 00:41:30,137
- So impressive.
- Nice work. - Nice.

919
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:31,896
- Good work.
- Good job, Kyle.

920
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,068
Sue, come on over.

921
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:40,077
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

922
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:42,000
Well done.
Are those tears I see?

923
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:44,793
- I'm hugging you.
- Yeah, hug me. I love a hug.

924
00:41:45,793 --> 00:41:49,172
Sue,
individual immunity is yours.

925
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:51,758
Guaranteed a spot
in the final ten.

926
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:53,827
You will see day 16
in this game.

927
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,965
The emotion is always personal.

928
00:41:56,068 --> 00:41:58,172
- So what is it for you?
- So...

929
00:41:58,275 --> 00:42:02,310
If you're just... Like,
how would this even be possible?

930
00:42:02,413 --> 00:42:04,275
Because I got a bunch
of warriors over here.

931
00:42:04,379 --> 00:42:06,965
So it really feels good,
but I just kept telling myself.

932
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:09,896
I kept channeling all
the strength of my whole family,

933
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,586
knowing that everyone
at home is rooting for me.

934
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:15,344
And they'll be so proud
of me doing this.

935
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:16,862
- Well done.
- Thank you.

936
00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:18,924
That was definitely possible
'cause it happened.

937
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:21,551
You are safe tonight,
will not be going home.

938
00:42:21,655 --> 00:42:23,137
- Thank you.
- Head back over.

939
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,551
- Good job, Sue.
- Sue!

940
00:42:27,931 --> 00:42:29,379
Kyle, come on over.

941
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:31,241
- Go, Kyle.
- Hat trick.

942
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:33,609
This is becoming routine.

943
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,172
Third straight time this season,

944
00:42:36,275 --> 00:42:37,827
individual immunity is yours.

945
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,827
You are safe tonight
at Tribal Council.

946
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:41,655
You will see day 16.

947
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:43,827
Guaranteed a spot
in the final ten.

948
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:44,931
Head back over.

949
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,413
- Congrats.
- Good job, Kyle.

950
00:42:46,517 --> 00:42:47,931
Proud of you, brother.

951
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:51,551
All right, so Sue is safe,

952
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,310
Kyle is safe. Everybody else,

953
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:54,655
Tribal Council tonight,

954
00:42:54,758 --> 00:42:57,068
where somebody will be
the eighth person

955
00:42:57,172 --> 00:42:59,103
voted out of Survivor47,

956
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:01,862
and you will become
the first member of our jury.

957
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:04,132
Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight at Tribal.

958
00:43:06,275 --> 00:43:09,862
I came into this game
wanting to be an inspiration

959
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,275
to my generation.

960
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:14,172
If I can do this against all
of these younger people,

961
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:15,551
you can, too.

962
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:17,275
Age is just a number.

963
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:19,586
Get out of your beds,
get out of your couches.

964
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:20,758
Believe in yourself

965
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:23,241
and come playSurvivor.

966
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:37,034
Kyle.

967
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:39,551
- Good work, man.
- Thank you.

968
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:41,586
Congrats, Kyle and Sue.

969
00:43:41,689 --> 00:43:44,551
- Hat Trick Kyle.
- Hat Trick Kyle.

970
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,137
- Yeah, what a battle, guys.
- So amazing.

971
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:49,235
They're making it seem like
they're happy for me,

972
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:51,172
but I know everybody here
is gonna want me out,

973
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:52,586
especially now.

974
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:54,655
This is my third
immunity win in a row.

975
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:57,551
So, as you can imagine out here,

976
00:43:57,655 --> 00:44:00,172
I'm really creating a name
for myself.

977
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:01,482
This is not good.

978
00:44:01,586 --> 00:44:02,827
It's good for me today,

979
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,598
but it could be
the death of me tomorrow.

980
00:44:17,827 --> 00:44:21,000
With Kyle and Sue
off the table and safe, Gabe is,

981
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,000
by far, a bigger threat

982
00:44:23,103 --> 00:44:26,275
than Caroline is
at this point in the game.

983
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:27,655
Here is my only thought.

984
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:29,200
- I'm a little bit more scared of Gabe.
- Same.

985
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:30,718
- Yeah.
- Do you think we need to split

986
00:44:30,724 --> 00:44:32,338
or do you think
we should just keep it clean?

987
00:44:32,344 --> 00:44:33,586
I think we can keep it clean.

988
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:35,344
Yeah.

989
00:44:35,448 --> 00:44:36,724
Okay.

990
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:38,448
The Gata-Lavo alliance has been

991
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,206
a very natural and easy thing
for all of us.

992
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,620
And before you know it,

993
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:44,448
there ain't gonna
be any more Tuku left.

994
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,275
I feel like I was, like...

995
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:50,659
I just wanted
to catch up with you guys.

996
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:53,353
- Yeah.
- And it sounds like...

997
00:44:53,448 --> 00:44:54,752
- I feel a little behind, that's all.
- Yeah.

998
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,172
You know, Andy has just been

999
00:44:56,275 --> 00:44:58,344
somebody we're...
we've been keeping around

1000
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:00,073
'cause he's still
in Sam and I's pocket.

1001
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:02,448
He's just, like, an easy number
that we could use.

1002
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:03,959
He's not a threat,
he's not somebody

1003
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:05,482
I'm worried about in the game.

1004
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:08,206
So I'm, like, you know,
might as well drag him along

1005
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,103
a little longer until, you know,
we can no longer tolerate him.

1006
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:12,448
But we just want to make sure

1007
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:14,062
- that you're still strong with us.
- I am.

1008
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:15,959
- And, like, that we still have you locked in.
- Yeah.

1009
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:18,172
- You swear?
- Yes, that is... I swear, that is...

1010
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:20,758
- I'm still your island sister?
- Island sister, yeah.

1011
00:45:20,862 --> 00:45:23,000
Sam and Sierra still feel like

1012
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:26,344
they own me, and they have me
in their pockets.

1013
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:28,344
They look at me
as an expendable piece,

1014
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:30,448
and as sort of a weak player.

1015
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:32,752
He came over to
me, and he was like, "I'm having

1016
00:45:32,758 --> 00:45:34,175
a really bad day,"
and I'm, like...

1017
00:45:34,275 --> 00:45:36,269
I just feel like the guy's had
a series of bad days.

1018
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,137
- It's really sad.
- I know.

1019
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:40,097
And so, for me,
that's enough to just cut bait.

1020
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,034
Like, goodbye.

1021
00:45:42,137 --> 00:45:45,034
I feel like this is my, like,
She's All That makeover moment.

1022
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:47,241
I'm starting this game
just like,

1023
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,655
"Oh, hi, I'm Andy.
Like, please like me.

1024
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:53,482
"Um, Sierra and Sam,
like, you're the cool kids.

1025
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:55,758
Like, can you... can I sit
at your lunch table?"

1026
00:45:55,862 --> 00:45:58,034
And now I'm at the merge.

1027
00:46:00,689 --> 00:46:03,620
And I'm getting a lot cooler
and, like, I don't need

1028
00:46:03,724 --> 00:46:05,793
to wear these freaking glasses
anymore, and

1029
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,172
I could be...

1030
00:46:07,275 --> 00:46:10,896
the Andy that
I believe myself to be.

1031
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,862
I could be my full version
of myself.

1032
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:16,793
And I can turn into the pivotal
player in this post-merge.

1033
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:18,206
Sam and Sierra.

1034
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:22,476
- And so...
- You don't have to work with them anymore.

1035
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:23,862
Let's do it.

1036
00:46:23,965 --> 00:46:25,683
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah. It's looking really good.

1037
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:27,614
I can make my
own lunch table. Sam, Sierra

1038
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,965
and Rachel... they're gonna be
shocked by the new Andy.

1039
00:46:30,068 --> 00:46:32,344
They're not gonna
see me coming, and...

1040
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:33,655
that was stupid.

1041
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:35,172
Like, I've been doing a lot.

1042
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:36,925
I've been doing a lot
behind their backs.

1043
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:39,310
I feel like I'm a Lavo.

1044
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:41,034
I love hearing that.

1045
00:46:41,137 --> 00:46:43,310
I want to build
an alliance with myself,

1046
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:45,034
Lavo and Tuku, and I think

1047
00:46:45,137 --> 00:46:47,827
splitting up Sam and Sierra
is of the utmost importance.

1048
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,620
They're gonna be like,
"Damn, Andy did that. Our Andy?

1049
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,448
Wait, no.
He was gonna be our goat."

1050
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:55,275
- I'm looking to change my fate.
- Yeah.

1051
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,028
Just have a number of people
who we're actually working with.

1052
00:46:57,034 --> 00:46:58,344
- Yeah. That's awesome.
- Yeah.

1053
00:46:58,448 --> 00:46:59,724
We can just line 'em up

1054
00:46:59,827 --> 00:47:02,344
and take 'em all out
one by one, you know.

1055
00:47:02,448 --> 00:47:04,490
- That's promising. I'm down for that.
- I mean...

1056
00:47:04,586 --> 00:47:06,827
It is perfect, a chef's kiss.

1057
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:08,310
You know, however many

1058
00:47:08,413 --> 00:47:10,724
Gata he wants to turn on,
that works for me.

1059
00:47:12,758 --> 00:47:15,217
- I feel pretty good that he's voting with us.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1060
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:17,649
That's the question.
I don't know.

1061
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:19,752
I think Sam's more of a
physical threat, but she is...

1062
00:47:19,758 --> 00:47:22,000
- The social game's the dangerous part.
- Yeah.

1063
00:47:22,103 --> 00:47:23,482
I see Sierra

1064
00:47:23,586 --> 00:47:26,137
as the head of the snake
right now

1065
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:29,034
of Gata, and it's fitting,
because Gata's logo is a snake.

1066
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,620
So, I mean, there you go.

1067
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:32,407
You know, I think it'll be
a good time to disarm 'em.

1068
00:47:32,413 --> 00:47:35,137
And whether
it's Sam or Sierra or...

1069
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:36,586
Like, how do you feel
about that?

1070
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:37,931
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1071
00:47:38,034 --> 00:47:39,551
- You're in?
- Yeah.

1072
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:41,200
If there are
eight people strong,

1073
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:43,275
being the four Tukus,
the three Lavos

1074
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:46,862
and Andy,
Sierra will be out of the game.

1075
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:48,821
I think the easy thing
to do, which we could all, like,

1076
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:51,758
see right now is to work with
the Gatas and get a Tuku out.

1077
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:54,034
Right? Like, Gabe,
because whatever. Um...

1078
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,931
I kind of want
to work with the Gata...

1079
00:47:56,034 --> 00:47:57,442
- Not the Gata, but Tuku.
- Tuku?

1080
00:47:57,448 --> 00:47:58,787
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

1081
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,517
Would you rather lose Sam,
Sierra or Rachel?

1082
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,034
I think it would be Sierra.

1083
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:05,482
Right now
I'm in sort of a pickle where

1084
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:08,128
Sierra is somebody who I feel
like I'm very good friends with.

1085
00:48:08,137 --> 00:48:10,793
Working with her in this game
is something I want to do.

1086
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:12,689
But I don't want to

1087
00:48:12,793 --> 00:48:15,344
take the reins and be
too pushy about anything.

1088
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:16,856
Are you gonna be choked?

1089
00:48:16,862 --> 00:48:18,407
I know you're tight
with Sierra and Sam.

1090
00:48:18,413 --> 00:48:19,705
- Like, honestly.
- Um...

1091
00:48:20,793 --> 00:48:22,724
- Okay.
- I'm tight with Sierra.

1092
00:48:22,827 --> 00:48:25,028
So I would want Sam to be
the Gata who goes home tonight.

1093
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:28,551
My hope is that I can convince
everybody to vote Sam out.

1094
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,827
I am very, very scared of him.

1095
00:48:30,931 --> 00:48:32,655
He's the bigger threat.

1096
00:48:32,758 --> 00:48:34,310
As far as this vote goes, like,

1097
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:36,931
if I had my way,
it would be Sam.

1098
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:38,862
You want Sierra out over Sam?

1099
00:48:38,965 --> 00:48:40,482
'Cause that's not my preference.

1100
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:43,724
Sam is the biggest threat
of the three of them.

1101
00:48:43,827 --> 00:48:45,620
I think he's the head
of the Gata snake.

1102
00:48:45,724 --> 00:48:48,517
I think he is charming.
He gets everybody laughing.

1103
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,551
Sam?

1104
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:54,275
Agreed.

1105
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:56,344
- Hey, hey.
- Look at that.

1106
00:48:56,448 --> 00:48:57,476
My vote's going on Sam tonight.

1107
00:48:57,482 --> 00:48:59,241
That's for sure.

1108
00:48:59,344 --> 00:49:01,344
I'd like to break up Sam
and Sierra, but...

1109
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:03,310
If they're nervous

1110
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:05,663
and they have an idol,
they wouldn't play it on Rachel.

1111
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:07,273
- Right.
- She's not in their duo.

1112
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,517
Rachel may be the easier one
to go for 'cause

1113
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,925
they would never
play it on Rachel.

1114
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:12,137
Voting out Gatas

1115
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,793
is in almost everyone's
best interest.

1116
00:49:14,896 --> 00:49:16,200
I personally would
love Rachel to leave.

1117
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:17,758
I think she's the best player

1118
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:19,206
in this game right now.

1119
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,097
I think she is the most
dangerous. I want her gone.

1120
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:22,649
- I would like Rachel.
- Yeah.

1121
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:24,103
Genevieve would like Rachel.

1122
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:25,793
- Really?
- Yeah.

1123
00:49:26,793 --> 00:49:29,000
Why? About where everyone is?

1124
00:49:30,724 --> 00:49:32,200
I know it's weird
that everyone's, like, gone.

1125
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:34,000
Something just doesn't
feel right to me.

1126
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:36,896
I want to feel good
in this kind of Gata-Lavo,

1127
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,965
like, union.

1128
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:41,527
But they're still having a lot
of conversations with people.

1129
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:47,787
You just don't
know what's gonna happen, but

1130
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:49,293
what I do know
is that I have an idol

1131
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:50,655
that nobody knows about.

1132
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:52,137
Now, it's, like,
the pressure's on

1133
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:54,517
that I know when and if
I need to play it.

1134
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,344
I want to go Rachel.

1135
00:50:00,482 --> 00:50:01,793
I've put too much damn work

1136
00:50:01,896 --> 00:50:04,000
in helping out Rachel

1137
00:50:04,103 --> 00:50:05,689
to have her go home tonight.

1138
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:07,172
I just want
to split up that duo.

1139
00:50:07,275 --> 00:50:09,413
Rachel can be someone
we can use.

1140
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:12,586
Rachel's my
ultimate preference to go home.

1141
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:15,068
But there are many different
cooks in the kitchen,

1142
00:50:15,172 --> 00:50:16,793
and we want different things.

1143
00:50:16,896 --> 00:50:19,172
If you ask Teeny,
she wants Sam out.

1144
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:22,000
Sol wants Sierra out,
and I would take out Rachel.

1145
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,413
She's a strategic thinker,
she's social.

1146
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:26,103
I see her as a huge threat.

1147
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:29,827
And in this group
that will be voting together,

1148
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:31,172
what are the odds

1149
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:32,655
all eight of us
are gonna be like,

1150
00:50:32,758 --> 00:50:34,580
"Hey, yeah, that's the target,
we all agree"?

1151
00:50:34,586 --> 00:50:36,034
Slim to none.

1152
00:51:01,275 --> 00:51:02,586
So this is it.

1153
00:51:02,689 --> 00:51:04,586
This is the group

1154
00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:06,827
that will define Survivor47.

1155
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,793
Because at the very least,
you all will

1156
00:51:09,896 --> 00:51:13,206
have a say in who wins,
if not be one of the people

1157
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,172
vying for it at the end.

1158
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:18,758
So, Sam,
where is the game right now

1159
00:51:18,862 --> 00:51:20,321
and where do you think
it's heading?

1160
00:51:20,413 --> 00:51:22,551
The game is...

1161
00:51:22,655 --> 00:51:24,034
waiting for war,

1162
00:51:24,137 --> 00:51:25,793
and you don't want to be the one

1163
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:27,862
that's still getting ready

1164
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:29,442
while everybody else
is already in battle.

1165
00:51:29,448 --> 00:51:31,206
Gabe, agree?

1166
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,517
I mean, is there
a war coming? Sure.

1167
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,344
Survivoris a war.
It always is, but

1168
00:51:35,448 --> 00:51:38,103
there's a lot
of moving parts, and

1169
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:39,758
folks were lied to today,

1170
00:51:39,862 --> 00:51:41,827
but that's what
Tribal Council's for.

1171
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,827
Your pen goes to parchment,

1172
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:45,586
and it reveals
your true intentions.

1173
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,482
Andy, how about for you?

1174
00:51:47,586 --> 00:51:50,344
Well, I'm glad everyone's
still getting ready for war.

1175
00:51:50,448 --> 00:51:52,793
I got two votes at the last
Tribal Council I attended,

1176
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:54,448
so, I'm under attack already.

1177
00:51:54,551 --> 00:51:56,586
Like, the battle cries
are sounding.

1178
00:51:56,689 --> 00:51:59,793
Like, I'm at war.
And so, we're trying to see

1179
00:51:59,896 --> 00:52:01,172
what factions are linking up

1180
00:52:01,275 --> 00:52:02,545
and what factions
are gonna be left

1181
00:52:02,551 --> 00:52:04,103
to be vulnerable

1182
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:07,000
to this first attack, which is
tonight, which is a big night.

1183
00:52:07,103 --> 00:52:08,620
Gabe?

1184
00:52:08,724 --> 00:52:10,224
Just to stick
with our war analogy...

1185
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:12,131
that seems to be the theme
of Tribal Council tonight.

1186
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:13,310
- It's working.
- Yeah.

1187
00:52:13,413 --> 00:52:17,241
So, Christmas Day
of World War I, I believe,

1188
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:21,275
there was a ceasefire,
and both sides came together,

1189
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:23,275
and they played a game
of soccer.

1190
00:52:23,379 --> 00:52:25,034
And then the very next day,

1191
00:52:25,137 --> 00:52:27,896
they just went back to
throwing bullets at each other.

1192
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And that's what auction day
kind of felt like.

1193
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:31,655
- Yeah, you're right.
- It felt like

1194
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:33,551
we all had a ceasefire.

1195
00:52:33,655 --> 00:52:36,137
And then, the next morning,
you wake up, and

1196
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:37,482
shots start firing again.

1197
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:38,959
Teeny, why were you nodding?

1198
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:41,586
What was it
about what Gabe said?

1199
00:52:41,689 --> 00:52:43,338
You know, we've all enjoyed
these milestones

1200
00:52:43,344 --> 00:52:45,551
of Survivortogether...
making the merge,

1201
00:52:45,655 --> 00:52:47,862
making the jury, at this point.

1202
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:49,896
The next goal
is making it to the end.

1203
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,344
So, yeah, we're friends, but

1204
00:52:52,448 --> 00:52:54,896
it's not a game of friends.
It's a game of Survivor.

1205
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,758
And there's only one winner.

1206
00:52:56,862 --> 00:52:58,793
Genevieve, is a group

1207
00:52:58,896 --> 00:53:01,689
this large just as scary if not

1208
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:04,344
scarier than a group of five?

1209
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,517
Yeah,
because in a group of five,

1210
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,689
to have a majority,
you need three,

1211
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:11,068
which means you need
to rely on two people.

1212
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:14,620
In a group this big, you need
to rely on many more people.

1213
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,344
And relying on anyone

1214
00:53:16,448 --> 00:53:19,931
but yourself is...

1215
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:21,862
treacherous in Survivor.

1216
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:24,068
And Sierra,
to Genevieve's point,

1217
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:25,655
there's also trust.

1218
00:53:25,758 --> 00:53:28,448
You can have all the numbers
stored perfectly,

1219
00:53:28,551 --> 00:53:30,275
but if the information's bad,

1220
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:32,344
- then the numbers are bad.
- Jeff,

1221
00:53:32,448 --> 00:53:34,137
school didn't come
that easy to me.

1222
00:53:34,241 --> 00:53:36,551
And keeping all these numbers
and names and, like,

1223
00:53:36,655 --> 00:53:39,103
putting all the pieces
together... it's something that

1224
00:53:39,206 --> 00:53:41,498
is really taking a toll on me
mentally, 'cause I'm like,

1225
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,758
"Oh, my gosh, how do you
keep track of all this?"

1226
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:45,620
But as far as tonight goes,

1227
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:47,724
we will see
where our trust lies,

1228
00:53:47,827 --> 00:53:50,241
short-term and
long-term alliances, you know,

1229
00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:52,413
starting from back
when it was just Gata,

1230
00:53:52,517 --> 00:53:55,379
but also now,
we all have new alliances.

1231
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,774
And truthfully, I think tonight

1232
00:53:56,793 --> 00:53:58,413
is, like, a huge outcome

1233
00:53:58,517 --> 00:54:00,028
of what the rest of the game
will look like.

1234
00:54:00,034 --> 00:54:01,413
Sam, you were nodding.

1235
00:54:01,517 --> 00:54:03,275
- You agree?
- Yeah, I do.

1236
00:54:03,379 --> 00:54:05,028
It's a lot more difficult
to be a shepherd

1237
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:07,793
when you got more animals
to keep track of.

1238
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:09,620
It's scary.
You want to have your finger

1239
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:12,413
on the pulse of the game,
vote or no vote.

1240
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:14,034
Like, you want
to feel like you know

1241
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:16,517
where things are kind of headed.

1242
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,829
But you start to wonder like,

1243
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:19,379
"Is there something
I'm missing?"

1244
00:54:19,482 --> 00:54:21,586
Kyle, if the
vote goes the way you think

1245
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:24,034
it's gonna go, will it be about

1246
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:26,448
a group, an alliance
getting their way,

1247
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:29,379
or is it taking out
a threat in the game?

1248
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:31,482
We're all
standing here like a bunch

1249
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:33,448
of gladiators
ready to brawl in an arena.

1250
00:54:33,551 --> 00:54:35,724
I think that if you
stand out as a threat,

1251
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:37,931
then you're probably
going to get hit.

1252
00:54:38,034 --> 00:54:40,620
So it's, like, in a sick way,

1253
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:42,655
almost a compliment,
saying, like,

1254
00:54:42,758 --> 00:54:44,206
"Hey, like, you're really good

1255
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,586
at this game,
and I need you to not be."

1256
00:54:47,689 --> 00:54:49,827
Caroline,

1257
00:54:49,931 --> 00:54:51,758
- you agree with that?
- Absolutely.

1258
00:54:51,862 --> 00:54:53,987
I honestly think, at this point,
if you're targeted,

1259
00:54:54,068 --> 00:54:56,758
it's a huge sign of, like,
respect and admiration.

1260
00:54:56,862 --> 00:55:00,068
Andy, how
certain are you that you know

1261
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,586
where the vote is going?

1262
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:04,206
Um... I have a plan.

1263
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:05,586
I have a name in mind,

1264
00:55:05,689 --> 00:55:08,068
and I do feel pretty confident

1265
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:09,793
that that is what's
gonna happen.

1266
00:55:09,896 --> 00:55:11,827
Now, that's not always
been the case.

1267
00:55:11,931 --> 00:55:14,172
Actually, you know,
my last Tribal Council,

1268
00:55:14,275 --> 00:55:16,413
I felt confident,
and I was surprised.

1269
00:55:16,517 --> 00:55:18,275
Point being,
people will be left out

1270
00:55:18,379 --> 00:55:20,862
and be upset.

1271
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,931
All right, group question.

1272
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:26,137
How many people here
are uncomfortable

1273
00:55:26,241 --> 00:55:28,241
that you could be
completely wrong?

1274
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:32,517
So, nobody here

1275
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,793
really has any certainty.

1276
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:37,448
Teeny, is this
an obvious question

1277
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,965
or does it speak
to where this game is right now?

1278
00:55:40,068 --> 00:55:43,655
I mean, there's never
any certainty at Tribal Council,

1279
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:46,137
and if you feel it,
then you should be

1280
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:47,793
in trouble, and you usually are.

1281
00:55:47,896 --> 00:55:51,000
But especially
at an 11-person Tribal Council,

1282
00:55:51,103 --> 00:55:53,103
where we have not truly

1283
00:55:53,206 --> 00:55:55,379
tested our trust
with each other.

1284
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:57,310
And I think it's monumental,

1285
00:55:57,413 --> 00:55:59,344
because it's an indicator
of what to come.

1286
00:55:59,448 --> 00:56:02,482
What happens tonight
is really going to show

1287
00:56:02,586 --> 00:56:05,827
that, you know, there's a level
of play going on here

1288
00:56:05,931 --> 00:56:07,620
that we haven't yet seen.

1289
00:56:10,448 --> 00:56:12,172
All right, it is

1290
00:56:12,275 --> 00:56:15,413
time to vote.
Sol, you're up.

1291
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:14,931
I'll go tally the votes.

1292
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,413
If anybody has an advantage

1293
00:57:31,517 --> 00:57:32,965
or an idol
and you want to play it,

1294
00:57:33,068 --> 00:57:35,275
now would be the time to do so.

1295
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:43,379
Jeff?

1296
00:57:44,482 --> 00:57:46,103
I thought I knew

1297
00:57:46,206 --> 00:57:48,758
what was going on
coming into this Tribal tonight,

1298
00:57:48,862 --> 00:57:50,097
but the longer
the Tribal went on,

1299
00:57:50,103 --> 00:57:51,862
the more this feeling of dread

1300
00:57:51,965 --> 00:57:53,827
filled my stomach. Um,

1301
00:57:53,931 --> 00:57:55,545
and I was supposed
to go home last Tribal,

1302
00:57:55,551 --> 00:57:58,655
and I don't want any

1303
00:57:58,758 --> 00:58:00,482
shoulda, coulda, wouldas, so,

1304
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:02,235
- Good for you.
- I played my Shot in the Dark.

1305
00:58:02,241 --> 00:58:03,482
Ooh. Ooh.

1306
00:58:03,586 --> 00:58:05,551
Oh.

1307
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:07,655
Thank you.

1308
00:58:13,862 --> 00:58:17,206
So, Rachel played
her Shot in the Dark, which means

1309
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:18,862
there is no vote in here
from Rachel.

1310
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:21,034
If this says you're safe,

1311
00:58:21,137 --> 00:58:24,344
then any votes cast
for Rachel will not count.

1312
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,275
Rachel, you are...

1313
00:58:36,965 --> 00:58:38,793
...not safe.

1314
00:58:38,896 --> 00:58:42,586
Any votes cast
for Rachel will still count.

1315
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:49,310
All right, I'll read the votes.

1316
00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:55,517
First vote: Sam.

1317
00:58:56,931 --> 00:59:00,172
Gabe.

1318
00:59:01,827 --> 00:59:04,655
Sam.
Two votes Sam.

1319
00:59:07,551 --> 00:59:09,241
Sierra.

1320
00:59:09,344 --> 00:59:11,206
- Wow.
- Two votes Sam,

1321
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,758
one vote Gabe, one vote Sierra.

1322
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:17,344
Sam.
That's three votes Sam,

1323
00:59:17,448 --> 00:59:19,586
one vote Gabe, one vote Sierra.

1324
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:23,620
Sierra. That's three votes Sam,

1325
00:59:23,724 --> 00:59:25,724
two votes Sierra, one vote Gabe.

1326
00:59:31,379 --> 00:59:34,551
Sam. That's four votes Sam,
two votes Sierra,

1327
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:36,275
one vote Gabe.

1328
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,103
Sierra.

1329
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:42,758
- Wow.
- That's four votes Sam,

1330
00:59:42,862 --> 00:59:45,551
three votes Sierra,
one vote left.

1331
00:59:50,689 --> 00:59:52,000
Sierra.

1332
00:59:52,103 --> 00:59:54,103
We're tied.- ...

1333
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:57,931
Wow.

1334
00:59:58,034 --> 00:59:59,689
Sam and Sierra

1335
00:59:59,793 --> 01:00:01,827
both have four votes,

1336
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,344
so we're gonna revote.

1337
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,931
But this is a unique situation

1338
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:07,551
that needs an explanation.

1339
01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:10,103
Typically, when you have
two players who are tied,

1340
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,862
they don't vote simply because

1341
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:13,862
they can only vote
for each other,

1342
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:16,000
so their votes
nullify each other.

1343
01:00:16,103 --> 01:00:17,687
That's the only reason
they don't vote.

1344
01:00:17,758 --> 01:00:20,137
That's not the case tonight.
Sam, you don't have a vote.

1345
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,896
You didn't cast a vote. Sierra
does, and she did cast a vote.

1346
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,758
So, Sierra,
you will vote in the revote.

1347
01:00:25,862 --> 01:00:27,620
- Wow.
- So everybody will vote

1348
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:30,827
except Sam and Rachel,
who played her Shot in the Dark.

1349
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:33,137
And you can only vote
for Sierra or Sam.

1350
01:00:33,241 --> 01:00:36,379
All right, Sol, you're up.
Will you come grab the urn?

1351
01:01:03,896 --> 01:01:05,965
I acknowledge
I'm doing you dirty,

1352
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:08,620
but I'm a dirty player.

1353
01:01:14,965 --> 01:01:16,689
I'll read the votes.

1354
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:24,137
First vote: Sam.

1355
01:01:27,241 --> 01:01:30,275
Sierra. One vote Sam,
one vote Sierra.

1356
01:01:32,206 --> 01:01:35,551
Sierra. Two votes Sierra,
one vote Sam.

1357
01:01:37,103 --> 01:01:39,793
That's three votes Sierra,
one vote Sam.

1358
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,655
Sierra. That's four votes
Sierra, one vote Sam.

1359
01:01:50,827 --> 01:01:53,310
Eighth person
voted out of Survivor47

1360
01:01:53,413 --> 01:01:55,310
and the first member
of our jury: Sierra.

1361
01:01:55,413 --> 01:01:58,068
That's five. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

1362
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,931
Yeah.

1363
01:02:00,034 --> 01:02:02,758
If I'm the biggest threat
sitting here, it's pretty...

1364
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:05,310
- I'm pretty honored, so, thank you.
- Good game.

1365
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:10,034
Well done, guys.

1366
01:02:15,586 --> 01:02:18,068
Sierra, the tribe has spoken.

1367
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:22,068
- Can I have a hug?
- Course.

1368
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:25,620
Pleasure having you out here.

1369
01:02:25,724 --> 01:02:28,103
- Oh. Bye, Sierra.
- Bye, Sierra.

1370
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:30,206
See you, Sierra.

1371
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:44,724
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp. Good night.

1380
01:03:20,241 --> 01:03:22,896
I think
you blow up everybody's game.

1381
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,068
This is nightmare fuel.

1382
01:03:29,482 --> 01:03:30,890
You know, I couldn't tell you
what happened.

1383
01:03:30,896 --> 01:03:32,275
I'm completely blindsided.

1384
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:34,689
I'm typically somebody
who picks up on cues,

1385
01:03:34,793 --> 01:03:36,655
and there was no sign.

1386
01:03:36,758 --> 01:03:39,000
So, I'm out here
with some really great liars.

1387
01:03:39,103 --> 01:03:41,689
You know, I gave it my all,
and I had a blast out here.

1388
01:03:41,793 --> 01:03:43,620
But I do have a big job
ahead of me,

1389
01:03:43,724 --> 01:03:45,344
being the first member
of the jury,

1390
01:03:45,448 --> 01:03:47,862
and I'm gonna be a pretty
friggin' tough judge now.
