00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:07,674
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,050
>> PROBST: ...at the ailing Ravu

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,719
tribe, Yau-Man and Earl were the

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,095
only ones that knew that the

6
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,138
immunity idol was hidden at

7
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:13,346
camp.

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,181
>> Yau and I have an upper hand

9
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,266
because we're the only ones that

10
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,142
know that it's even on this

11
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,101
island.

12
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:18,643
It's time to go hunting for

13
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,060
crab.

14
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,603
>> PROBST: And they worked

15
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,938
together to find it.

16
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,481
>> I'm very excited.

17
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,482
I get a chance to dig.

18
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,358
I don't know for how long.

19
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,192
>> PROBST: But Yau-Man's search

20
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,110
was in vain.

21
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,362
>> Try again.

22
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,238
>> PROBST: Drop your buffs.

23
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:30,447
>> What?

24
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,031
>> PROBST: Then the game took an

25
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:32,407
unexpected turn.

26
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,075
>> Mookie.

27
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:34,701
>> PROBST: Choosing members from

28
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,243
opposing tribes...

29
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,953
>> Come on, Dreamz.

30
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:37,704
>> PROBST: Maybe the biggest

31
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,789
rivalry thus far just paired up.

32
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,040
...the new tribes were formed.

33
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,041
Yau-Man, who are you going to

34
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:42,751
take?

35
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:43,626
>> Stacy.

36
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,753
>> PROBST: Lisi, never good to

37
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:45,795
be odd person out.

38
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,172
Lisi was left tribeless.

39
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:47,797
>> I thought this would be like

40
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,340
"I'm out!"

41
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,884
>> PROBST: So you just told

42
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,010
these guys that you're fine

43
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:52,927
going home.

44
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,553
>> Now would be a good time to

45
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,387
exit.

46
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,263
>> PROBST: Well, for the time

47
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:55,889
being, you'll be going to Exile

48
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,056
Island.

49
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,057
>> Great, thanks.

50
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,559
>> PROBST: One very big decision

51
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,101
left to make.

52
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,729
Which group is going to live on

53
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,856
the luxurious Moto beach and

54
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,899
which group of people is going

55
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:06,232
back to Ravu?

56
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,108
The fate of the two tribes was

57
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,193
determined...

58
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,028
Show it.

59
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,321
...when Edgardo pulled the

60
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,197
orange buff of Ravu.

61
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,323
(<i> cheering</i> )

62
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,034
>><i> Garcon,</i> my breakfast!

>> PROBST: At the new Moto...

64
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,994
>> This is real food.

65
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:18,953
>> PROBST: Earl, Michelle, and

66
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,288
Yau-Man enjoyed the comforts of

67
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,457
their new home.

68
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,666
>> My world just got turned

69
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,126
upside down and for the better.

70
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,169
>> Yeah!

71
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,046
>> PROBST: At Ravu...

72
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:28,963
>> I'm glad that there are no

73
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:29,506
women here.

74
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,256
>> PROBST: The new tribe of

75
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,216
strong men bonded.

76
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,175
>> You want to have Anthony just

77
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:32,842
get the fire going, and we'll go

78
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,718
fishing?

79
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,385
>> PROBST: But Anthony was left

80
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,636
behind.

81
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,303
>> Unfortunately, I'm left back

82
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,639
here to tend the fires while the

83
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,432
big men go off, and cookie is

84
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,100
still here at the campfire.

85
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,769
>> PROBST: At a tense immunity

86
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,353
challenge, the physically

87
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,314
inferior Moto Tribe surprised

88
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,190
Ravu when they pushed their way

89
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,692
to victory.

90
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,653
Moto wins immunity!

91
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,363
With tribal council looming...

92
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,448
>> Anthony, where's the flint?

93
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,282
>> PROBST: ...Anthony and Rocky

94
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,659
were on the chopping block.

95
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,285
>> I see myself really far from

96
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,870
being friends or liking Rocky a

97
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,288
lot, because all he would cause

98
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,456
is a lot of turmoil.

99
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,416
>> PROBST: At tribal council...

100
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,376
>> You have poor social skills.

101
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,293
>> I got poor social skills?

102
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,878
>> Yes!

103
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,462
>> PROBST: Anthony and Rocky

104
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,296
faced off.

105
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,880
>> You act like a little girl

106
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,214
sometimes.

107
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,715
>> This is why I don't say

108
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,258
anything.

109
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,133
>> Take the skirt off a little

110
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:14,634
bit.

111
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,468
Let's go.

112
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,052
>> PROBST: But Anthony was the

113
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:16,344
one to go.

114
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:20,223
Anthony, the tribe has spoken.

115
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,391
12 are left.

116
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,644
Who will be voted out tonight?

117
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,617
>> Five men, I think she'll take

118
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,286
a step back.

119
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:41,911
I think she just felt threatened

120
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,954
by the other girls on the other

121
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,873
tribe.

122
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,710
>> She was.

123
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,544
Lisi will be joining our tribe

124
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,420
today.

125
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,212
The episode she had during the

126
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,339
last challenge where she was

127
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,799
like "Well, I'm out of here"

128
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,884
does concern me a little bit,

129
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,467
but Lisi's the kind of person

130
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,344
just says what's on her mind at

131
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,470
that moment.

132
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,305
So I'm hoping a couple days on

133
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,389
Exile Island will help her

134
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,391
recant a little bit.

135
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,403
>> Hey!

136
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,906
>> Welcome home, baby!

137
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,282
>> I'm with the boys!

138
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,241
>> How was Exile?

139
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,160
>> Exile, can I just tell you,

140
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,413
it's not as bad as people think.

141
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,414
When I first got to Exile

142
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,707
Island, I cracked up.

143
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,167
I literally broke down.

144
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,293
But that's a great thing,

145
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,920
because when you break down, you

146
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:32,837
put your pieces back together

147
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,463
again.

148
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,589
It makes you stronger.

149
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,256
>> We thought you was going to

150
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,132
quit on us.

151
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,342
>> Whoo!

152
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,509
Well, I mean, imagine, we're

153
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,429
together for what, 14 days?

154
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,722
And all of a sudden it's like...

155
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,474
I had a breakdown.

156
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,725
I was like, "I'm out of here."

157
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,684
>> That's cool.

158
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,061
>> The dynamics in the tribe are

159
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,063
going to get a little sticky

160
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,065
because Edgardo and Alex and I

161
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:52,482
are really tight.

162
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,735
And I know that Rocky and Mookie

163
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,361
and even Dreamz might want to

164
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,571
get me out of the way.

165
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,989
Let me tell you something.

166
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,199
I reached, like, this spiritual

167
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,116
enlightenment.

168
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,118
Like, when you sit in one place

169
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,662
for a long time, you start

170
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,080
thinking, like, deep.

171
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,623
So I was, like, tripping, man.

172
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,374
I was up there like...

173
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,166
>> I told you she was going to

174
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:12,043
fit right in.

175
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:12,543
Didn't we tell you guys?

176
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,295
>> Back at old Moto, I never

177
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:14,879
really had a relationship with

178
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,005
Lisi.

179
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,547
I didn't like her.

180
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,298
She didn't like me.

181
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,591
>> Okay, we're officially on

182
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,093
<i>Survivor</i> now, guys.

183
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,052
>> So she should be worried out

184
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,680
of her mind.

185
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,108
(<i> theme song playing</i> )

186
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:40,923
>> I sleep so light.

187
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:46,512
I hear everything.

188
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,599
>> The new Moto tribe consists

189
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,433
of three old Ravu, which is

190
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,561
myself, Yau, and Michelle, and

191
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,314
old Moto, which is Cassandra,

192
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,357
Boo, and Stacy.

193
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,776
So now this new Moto is three

194
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,818
and three, so everybody has

195
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,944
three votes.

196
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,654
So we're even.

197
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,364
So... but we need to change the

198
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,033
power here.

199
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,868
I'm going to catch a fish.

200
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:09,660
Y'all want to go down in the

201
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,703
water a little bit?

202
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,287
>> I just want to get the boat

203
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,288
back.

204
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,164
>> Well, if anything, we can

205
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,707
just go do that, just go bring

206
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,750
the boat.

207
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,542
>> I'm setting something up with

208
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,711
Yau.

209
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,420
There is definitely an idol on

210
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,799
Ravu's camp and Moto's camp.

211
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,926
And we have an idea of exactly

212
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,427
where the immunity idol is here,

213
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,722
but we haven't had the chance to

214
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,225
go get it.

215
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,267
>> Yau-Man is going to stay

216
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:33,851
behind while the five of us go

217
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,937
retrieve the boat.

218
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,646
So this gives him a moment to

219
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,148
look, and we'll have it.

220
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,024
So that'll be our ace in the

221
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,151
pocket.

222
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,731
>> Right there.

223
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,566
Can you see it?

224
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,609
You can see it now.

225
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:37,748
>> Oh!

226
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,335
Oh, my God!

227
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,589
This is my... this is it.

228
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,257
This is my million dollars right

229
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,343
here.

230
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,389
I'm glad I'm not in an untying

231
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,432
contest right now, because I

232
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:59,687
would lose.

233
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,565
The one and only immunity idol.

234
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,358
I know there's another one

235
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,277
somewhere in the other island,

236
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,863
but right now, this is the only

237
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,614
one that exists.

238
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,074
This is mine.

239
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,659
This is mine.

240
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,119
It looks good on me.

241
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,747
It really does.

242
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,581
I'm going to jump out of my skin

243
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,792
here!

244
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,837
Turtle.

245
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,593
My plan now is to let Earl know,

246
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,304
because I owe him that much.

247
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,889
He engineered this whole boat-

248
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,350
saving party for me.

249
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,685
And so I agree to share the use

250
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,686
of this idol when the time comes

251
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,856
with him.

252
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,492
All right, untouched.

253
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,619
Back to work!

254
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:07,964
>> Yau-Man.

255
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:08,673
>> Yau, we're back.

256
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,633
>> My arms are falling off.

257
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,051
Did you guys get the boat?

258
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,427
>> No, it's too high up.

259
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,053
We're going to have to wait for

260
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:14,720
high tide.

261
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,638
>> Oh, well, good try and all

262
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,472
that.

263
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,848
Thank you, y'all.

264
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,350
The sun's not that hot, so I

265
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,143
should have gone out and helped.

266
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,144
>> It wasn't anything we can do.

267
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:22,853
The boat is so far up on the

268
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,854
rock.

269
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,192
With a net, where I was at, I'll

270
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,027
catch something.

271
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,903
>> Let's see how we can untangle

272
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,946
the net.

273
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:32,905
When I first came into this

274
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,699
game, I did not have any

275
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,534
expectation of finding a new

276
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,244
friend in such a short time that

277
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,121
I can trust so much.

278
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:45,876
>> But Earl is different.

279
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,961
His word was good.

280
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,588
I would have never thought that

281
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,424
a big, strong, black man would

282
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,842
become one of my best allies in

283
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,760
this game.

284
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,603
>> What I initially told Yau is

285
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,397
I will help you with the idol

286
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,982
because I knew the value of Yau,

287
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:08,691
and I knew if I helped this guy,

288
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,985
I could feel it that he would

289
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:11,777
actually remember that and would

290
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,988
trust me a lot.

291
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,990
>> I went at it so fast.

292
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,658
I was digging furiously.

293
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,452
I mean...

294
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,828
>> Yau having the idol helps

295
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,205
because hopefully there's a

296
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:23,748
power change.

297
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,958
We'll share this, you know.

298
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:26,876
If they're trying to vote me

299
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,044
out, he'll let me know, and

300
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,919
he'll give it to me.

301
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,754
And if they're trying to vote

302
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,297
him out, then he'll just use it,

303
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,923
and so that's the way how two

304
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,674
people can share an idol.

305
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,468
>> We'll make it to the final

306
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,053
two if all things align, you

307
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,846
know, Earl.

308
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,933
>> PROBST: Moto, come on in!

309
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,857
Ravu, come on in!

310
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,941
Moto getting your first look at

311
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,736
the new Ravu tribe.

312
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,112
Anthony voted out at the last

313
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:55,696
tribal council, and this

314
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,074
morning, Lisi joined their

315
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,283
tribe, returning from Exile

316
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,242
Island.

317
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,327
>> She made it.

318
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,204
Wow.

319
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,121
>> PROBST: For today's

320
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,706
challenge, each tribe will use a

321
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,375
flame thrower to launch

322
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,168
fireballs at three separate

323
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,336
targets.

324
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,629
Each time you hit a target, it

325
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,923
will burst into flames.

326
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,840
First tribe to ignite all three

327
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,427
of their targets wins reward.

328
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,428
You want to know what you're

329
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,096
playing for?

330
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,180
>> Yeah.

331
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,264
>> PROBST: Tomorrow morning, the

332
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,266
winning tribe will be picked up

333
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,060
by a seaplane and taken to your

334
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,771
own private Fijian arcade.

335
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,023
A little usual in the middle of

336
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,066
all these islands to find an

337
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,818
arcade, but we did.

338
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,404
So you'll have an afternoon of a

339
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,905
different kind of game playing,

340
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,240
foosball, air hockey, a bowling

341
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,491
alley.

342
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,992
And an afternoon at an arcade

343
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:42,910
would not be complete without

344
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,787
hot dogs and beer.

345
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,164
>> Yeah!

346
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,749
>> PROBST: In addition, the

347
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,209
winning tribe will send one

348
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,961
person from the losing tribe to

349
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,003
Exile Island.

350
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,046
Give you a minute to strategize.

351
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,508
We'll get started.

352
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,260
First two throwers, it is Earl

353
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,096
for Moto, Dreamz for Ravu.

354
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:02,763
>> Come on, Earl!

355
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,097
You got this!

356
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,806
>> You got it, Earl!

357
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,267
(<i> cheering</i> )

358
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,310
>> Hot dogs, Dreamz.

359
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,737
>> PROBST: When you're ready.

360
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,826
Three, two, one, launch.

361
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,871
Earl just short for Moto, inches

362
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:31,709
short.

363
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,544
Dreamz not messing around,

364
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:37,882
connects and scores for Ravu.

365
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:42,011
Ravu leads one-zip.

366
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,721
Next round, it is Michelle for

367
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,930
Moto, Lisi for Ravu.

368
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:49,351
Three, two, one, launch.

369
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,479
Lisi launches hard but short.

370
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,397
Michelle just misses.

371
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,482
>> Oh, good try!

372
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,357
Good try!

373
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:55,941
>> PROBST: It's Yau-Man for

374
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,653
Moto, Edgardo for Ravu.

375
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,571
>> You got it!

376
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,447
>> Yau!

377
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,615
>> Show them that secret

378
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,782
technique, Yau.

379
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,159
They don't know.

380
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,036

So they're more accepting.

They've gotten to know me

00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,402
the name to Earl Island.

572
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,362
I'll be accepting reservations

573
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,947
for tourism.

574
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,739
You have a nice view of the

575
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,366
ocean, plenty of room to lay

576
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,786
down, good eats.

577
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,662
Just like the finest

578
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,329
restaurants.

579
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,915
Yeah, this is my island.

580
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,417
Lodging isn't very good, but

581
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,962
it's a beautiful view.

582
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,048
Earl's island in Fiji.

583
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,055
>> Man, I just ate way too much

584
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,225
food.

585
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,226
Oh, god!

586
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,895
>> This is horrible.

587
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,355
What have we done?

588
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,399
>> Alex?

589
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,234
>> What?

590
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,653
>> Hurry up, man.

591
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,031
>> So two franks and another hot

592
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:03,994
dog and then a brownie and a

593
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:04,620
little bit of beer to wash it

594
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,039
all down with.

595
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,707
And oddly enough, felt kind of

596
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,042
sick.

597
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,085
>> Oh, god!

598
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,045
>> Those brownies were so good

599
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:13,837
today.

600
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,005
>> Oh, shush!

601
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:15,589
>> Can we not talk about it

602
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,340
right now?

603
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,382
>> Oh, how come... listen, how

604
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,634
come when I'm starving, right,

605
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,218
I'm sitting on the grass and the

606
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:20,802
dirt, everyone's talking about

607
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,930
chocolate chip ice cream.

608
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,139
You know, now they're all

609
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,349
rolling on the couch.

610
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,558
"Ah, my stomach."

611
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,267
So I started making fun of them.

612
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,477
"Oh, I'm going to eat 19 hot

613
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,354
dogs, and I'm going to eat 17

614
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,730
brownies."

615
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,940
They were running their mouth.

616
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:33,815
Now I'm full.

617
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,025
I feel great now.

618
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,276
Now yous all got stomachaches,

619
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,611
and now I can't talk about

620
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,695
brownies and stuff that I had

621
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,988
earlier today.

622
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:40,322
That's not fair.

623
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,990
People call me up on my own

624
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,241
stuff all the time.

625
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,201
I just think it's fair game, you

626
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,327
know?

627
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,411
And if you can't take stuff like

628
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,996
that here, you shouldn't be

629
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,331
here.

630
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,707
>> This is terrible.

631
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,000
>> I told you.

632
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,501
Everyone's hurting.

633
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,169
You guys better be ready for the

634
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:54,503
challenge soon.

635
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,420
I don't care.

636
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,381
>> You know what?

637
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:57,965
I'd rather have this feeling

638
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,257
than have the feeling of

639
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,425
starving.

640
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,385
>> Okay, well, then suck up the

641
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,011
stomachache and shut up then.

642
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,804
>> Rocky, he just doesn't fit in

643
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,888
with us.

644
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,306
We're pretty laid-back guys.

645
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,641
We make fun of each other, but

646
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,226
to a certain extent.

647
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,227
But Rocky takes it to another

648
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,435
level.

649
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,436
I think I gained, like, three

650
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,354
pounds.

651
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,438
>> Three pounds of stomachache

652
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,314
is what you gained.

653
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,274
>> Because he criticizes

654
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,442
everybody, and he's too harsh on

655
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,111
people, and people don't respect

656
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:19,695
that.

657
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,654
People don't want a guy to be

658
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,780
criticizing you all the time.

659
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,823
That's why they have, like,

660
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,949
bosses and teachers back at

661
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:24,825
home.

662
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,909
>> Listen, you've been crying

663
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,493
about this for three weeks.

664
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,704
You got what you wanted.

665
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,621
You went a little too crazy too

666
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,914
fast.

667
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,207
Suck it up.

668
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,500
(<i> Rocky laughing</i> )

669
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,930
>> We lost the reward challenge,

670
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,725
and it proved to us that we need

671
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,810
to step up our game if we want

672
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,436
to keep this immunity idol.

673
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,478
It's very important to each and

674
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,814
every one of us here.

675
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,815
Some of us, it's more important

676
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,442
than they really understand.

677
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,652
I mean, it's more important to

678
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,070
Yau than he knows, because if we

679
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,780
lose, he's gone tonight, because

680
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,364
he's got to be the weakest

681
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,450
physically out of all of us.

682
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:11,705
That's good.

683
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,622
>> Now things are definitely

684
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,623
looking up.

685
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm in an alliance with Earl,

686
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,960
who is very strong and a very

687
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,503
honorable man.

688
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,714
I have the immunity idol, and if

689
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,590
I can make it through the merge,

690
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,509
I can go quite far.

691
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,594
My first priority is not let

692
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,636
anybody know that I got the

693
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,971
immunity idol.

694
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,723
Then I have a really evil

695
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,933
thought.

696
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,351
I thought what if there is

697
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,436
another immunity idol for them

698
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,645
to find?

699
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,522
So I start out making my own

700
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,982
immunity idol out of a half

701
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,109
coconut shell.

702
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,152
Basically, I took a coconut

703
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,695
shell.

704
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,529
I paint it with a little face,

705
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,406
and I painted eyebrows.

706
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,700
And just in case they don't know

707
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,118
it's an immunity idol, I put the

708
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,496
initials "I.I." on it.

709
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,304
There are so many immunity idols

710
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,891
running around here.

711
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:13,725
I made that.

712
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,476
I wrapped it back up.

713
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,521
And when I see that Michelle and

714
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,482
Stacy was falling asleep in bed,

715
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,194
I went quickly and buried it

716
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,988
back in that hole.

717
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,406
I didn't bury it very deep, so

718
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,866
it's easier to find.

719
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,868
So I'm hoping that someone will

720
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,703
decide to hunt for the idol and

721
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,163
we'll have one too many idols

722
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,040
running around, except I have

723
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:41,628
the official one.

724
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,213
This upcoming immunity challenge

725
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,257
is very important to me.

726
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,800
I'm always the target, but I do

727
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,426
have the immunity idol.

728
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,011
If we lose this immunity

729
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,763
challenge, then I will have to

730
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,973
really keep my ears to the

731
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,016
ground and listen to see if I am

732
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,559
up.

733
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,103
If I am, then I will be forced

734
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,479
to use it, but I really hope I

735
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,690
do not need to use it.

736
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,367
>> PROBST: How's everybody

737
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,201
doing?

738
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:13,743
>> Good.

739
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,077
>> Good, Jeff.

740
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:14,661
>> PROBST: Let's get to it.

741
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,496
We'll now bring in Earl

742
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,873
returning once again from Exile

743
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,874
Island.

744
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,292
(<i> applause</i> )

745
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,793
>> Earl!

746
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,504
>> I'm back, feeling good.

747
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,130
>> PROBST: First thing's first,

748
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,425
take back immunity.

749
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,844
Thanks, Michelle.

750
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,929
Once again, immunity back up for

751
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,099
grabs.

752
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,475
For today's challenge, one

753
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,311
person will be your caller.

754
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,312
The rest of the tribe will be

755
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,897
blindfolded.

756
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,356
One at a time, the caller will

757
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,066
lead you out into a field where

758
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,236
there are five skulls hanging.

759
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,696
Using a Fijian war club, you

760
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,199
must smash a skull, releasing a

761
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,284
bundle of tiles.

762
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,453
Then, while still blindfolded,

763
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,079
you must find the tiles and take

764
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,664
them to your puzzle board.

765
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,500
Then race back to the start, and

766
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,001
the next person goes.

767
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,627
Once you've collected all five

768
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,796
bundles of tiles, as a tribe,

769
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,631
you have to unscramble the

770
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,091
puzzle to decipher a two-word

771
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:10,759
phrase.

772
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,053
First tribe to correctly solve

773
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,931
it wins immunity, guaranteed a

774
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,682
one-in-11 shot at a million

775
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,726
bucks.

776
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,977
>> All right!

777
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:21,978
>> That's what I'm talking about

778
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:22,854
>> PROBST: Losers, tribal

779
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,813
council tonight, somebody going

780
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,148
home.

781
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,233
If at some point during the

782
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,359
challenge, you want to switch

783
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,652
out callers, you're allowed to

784
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,736
do so.

785
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,278
I'll give you a minute to

786
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,363
strategize, and we'll get

787
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,074
started.

788
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,450
Here we go.

789
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,535
Michelle is the caller for Moto,

790
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,703
Lisi the caller for Ravu.

791
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,706
For immunity, survivors ready?

792
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,791
Go!

793
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,333
>> All right, Stacy, you're

794
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,334
good.

795
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:44,834
Follow that rail.

796
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,543
Follow that rail.

797
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,127
Go, go, go, go, go.

798
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:46,795
Three more paces, and you'll

799
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,128
feel the pole.

800
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,421
All right, slide right, slide

801
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,172
right.

802
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,465
>> Back, back, Alex, back.

803
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,591
Back, to your left, baby, to

804
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,634
your left.

805
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,636
>> It's right above you.

806
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,804
Do you feel it?

807
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,846
>> PROBST: Stacy takes the first

808
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,847

>> Hands on the floor.

810
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,765
Hands on the floor.

811

Forward, forward.

812
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,435
By your knee, by your knee.

813
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,561
There you go.

814
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,521
Okay, go forward, go forward.

815
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,272
Go forward, go forward.

816
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,064
Go forward, go forward.

Go forward, go forward.

818
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:07,774
Go forward.

819
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,817
The table's in front of you.

820
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,985
Do you feel it?

821
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:10,986
>> There you go.

822
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,153

connecting.

825
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,491
>> Let it stop swinging.

826
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,368
The skull is on the ground,

827
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,828
Alex.

828
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,620
>> It's on the ground?

829
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,579
>> Yes.

830
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:21,955
>> Where is it?

831
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:22,706
>> Move to your left, to your

Forward, forward, forward.

Right there.

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,670
Okay, you got it.

You got it.

Go down on your knees.

870

It's on the floor, right next to

Follow that rail.

951
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,887
You're doing awesome.

952
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,765
Follow that rail!

953
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,642
>> Forward, Mookie, right hand,

954
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,644
go!

955
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,146
>> PROBST: Mookie working for

956
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,106
that last skull for Ravu.

957
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:53,815
>> Okay, go forward, go forward,

958
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,774
Yau-Man!

959
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,818
Yau-Man, go forward!

960
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,404
Yau-Man, go forward!

961
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,156
Yau, stop!

962
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,074
Yau-Man, stop!

963
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:03,658
>> Hey, you want to switch,

964
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:04,576
Michelle?

965
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,201
I got a loud voice.

966
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,035
>> PROBST: Moto switching out,

967
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,370
Boo going to become the caller.

968
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,747
Both teams have one bundle left.

969
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,248
>> Tell me where it is.

970
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:10,999
>> I'm blind right now.

971
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:11,958
Hold on.

972
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,210
>> Run, run, run, stop!

973
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:14,919
To your right!

974
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:15,253
To the right!

975
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,797
Again, again!

976
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,257
>> Yau, to your left.

977
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,426
Now hit down.

978
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,595
Get them down!

979
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,762
Down on your knees!

980
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,847
Right in front of you!

981
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,348
By your knees!

982
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,099
>> PROBST: Yau-Man has the last

983
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,309
bundle.

984
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,685
>> Turn 180, 180.

985
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:31,519
>> PROBST: He's got to get it on

986
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,520
the puzzle table.

987
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,062
>> Left, left, left, on the

988
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,814
fence!

989
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,231
Left, on the fence!

990
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,566
>> PROBST: He does.

991
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,108
He's got to get back now.

992
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,277
>> Come back, Yau!

993
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,028
>> One half step forward,

994
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:40,236
Mookie.

995
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,655
Right there, smash it!

996
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,364
>> It's right below you!

997
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:43,948
Get on your hands and knees,

998
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:44,741
Mookie!

999
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,283
Stop!

1000
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:45,867
It's right in front of you,

1001
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,784
right next to the stick.

1002
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,287
Turn around, stop!

1003
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:49,871
>> Come back, Yau!

1004
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:50,997
Keep on, keep on!

1005
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,915
>> PROBST: Yau Man back.

1006
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,666
Take off your blindfolds!

1007
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,627
Go!

1008
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,420
Moto has all bundles!

1009
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,379
They're now working on the

1010
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,256
puzzle!

1011
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,549
>> Mookie, run!

1012
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,510
Forward, forward!

1013
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,594
>> PROBST: Mookie takes a hard

1014
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,220
hit into the side of the course.

1015
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:05,845
>> To your left, to your left,

1016
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,514
to your left!

1017
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,723
Forward, forward, forward!

1018
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:09,349
>> PROBST: Take off your

1019
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,309
blindfolds!

1020
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,436
Ravu has all five bundles!

1021
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,187
They're now working on the

1022
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,147
puzzle.

1023
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,233
It is a two-word phrase.

1024
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,526
>> "Castaway," "castaway,"

1025
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,486
"castaway."

1026
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,363
>> There's no<i> w.</i>

1027
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,906
It's not "castaway."

1028
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:25,949
>> Where is Michelle?

1029
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,867
>> Yes?

1030
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,993
"Cannibal," "cannibal,"

1031
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:29,911
"cannibal."

1032
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,206
>> "Cannibalism," "cannibalism."

1033
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,093
>> We're ready.

1034
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:45,718
>> PROBST: Moto thinks they have

1035
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,345
it.

1036
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,179
>> Yeah, baby!

1037
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,013
>> PROBST: "Cannibal Isles" is

1038
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:49,806
correct!

1039
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,266
Motto wins immunity!

1040
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,977
(<i> cheering</i> )

1041
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,403
>> PROBST: Moto,

1042
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,070
congratulations.

1043
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:04,279
>> Yeah.

1044
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,071
(<i> applause</i> )

1045
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,781
>> PROBST: You still have not

1046
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,533
lost an immunity challenge,

1047
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,284
nobody in danger of going home

1048
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,618
tonight.

1049
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,828
Ravu, unfortunately not the same

1050
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,662
case.

1051
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,580
One of the six of you will be

1052
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,664
voted out at tonight's tribal

1053
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,623
council.

1054
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,874
You have the afternoon to figure

1055
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,917
out who that's going to be.

1056
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:18,751
Grab your stuff.

1057
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,044
Head back to camp.

1058
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,656
>> We lost today.

1059
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,240
We're going to have to vote

1060
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,617
somebody out.

1061
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,826
Alex and I figured out that we

1062
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:52,577
don't need really strong

1063
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,370
players.

1064
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,955
You know, once we get closer to

1065
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,874
the merger, if there's a merger,

1066
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,000
what we need is people that are

1067
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,001
loyal, and Lisi is one of those

1068
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,962
people.

1069
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,714
I know Rocky's counting on

1070
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,549
getting Lisi out, but, I mean, I

1071
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,760
think his head is next.

1072
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:09,385
>> Rocky, I don't trust him that

1073
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,011
much.

1074
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,511
>> I don't trust Rocky.

1075
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,054
>> I don't know if we should

1076
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,889
tell Mookie or not, because he's

1077
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,306
tight with Rocky.

1078
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,098
>> Don't talk to him.

1079
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,267
>> But Rocky's out.

1080
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,518
I can't... I mean, I like the

1081
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,978
guy, but I can't... he's... last

1082
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:19,979
night he was just...

1083
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:20,938
>> Too much.

1084
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,231
>> Rocky has just this bad vibe

1085
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,441
about him, and I think one of

1086
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,025
the reasons that Ravu didn't

1087
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,277
ever win was his attitude about

1088
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,862
stuff.

1089
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,448
Lisi, Alex, and I were from the

1090
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,199
other tribe, and she knows that

1091
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,618
she has to be loyal to us

1092
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,161
because she doesn't have anybody

1093
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,331
else to tag along with.

1094
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,374
It's you, me, and Edgardo.

1095
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,166
>> I know this.

1096
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,626
>> So even if we get whittled

1097
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,586
down, the three of us are

1098
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,045
straight.

1099
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,171
>> For real, for real.

1100
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,548
>> So Rocky goes next, okay?

1101
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,466
>> Okay.

1102
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,467
>> And Ed and I were talking.

1103
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,593
He had kind of a good idea.

1104
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,386
I want to know your thoughts on

1105
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,261
it.

1106
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,597
Okay, we need to figure out who

1107
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,223
has got the damn immunity idol.

1108
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,974
>> Let me tell you something

1109
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,975
right now.

1110
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,227
The idol's on this island.

1111
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,520
It's here.

1112
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,229
>> Right.

1113
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,563
>> It's not on Exile.

1114
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,065
I think that with the clues that

1115
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,608
I have, you, me, and Edgardo

1116
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,693
should start prowling around the

1117
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,485
island.

1118
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,444
>> Yeah.

1119
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,946
>> I think we're better off if

1120
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,572
we try to spread this than just

1121
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,824
me trying to be greedy trying to

1122
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,866
find the idol, so...

1123
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,243
>> Right, I agree.

1124
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,119
>> Take me to the water so I can

1125
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,203
rinse off my freaking socks.

1126
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,663
>> All right, let's go.

1127
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,706
>> The story with the idol is

1128
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,249
there's some clues that I could

1129
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,292
go on which lead me to believe

1130
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,253
that it might be here, but it's

1131
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,504
all really vague.

1132
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,422
What I'm going to do with the

1133
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,881
idol is have Edgardo and Alex

1134
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,008
help me.

1135
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,677
>> What do these clue say?

1136
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,178
>> It might be right underneath

1137
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,389
this big cave, underneath where

1138
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,682
people sleep.

1139
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,726
>> Okay.

1140
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,893
>> So it might be... it might be

1141
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,479
underneath the palm fronds.

1142
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,188
We'll see what happens.

1143
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,648
You know, I have no choice but

1144
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,150
to believe Alex at this point.

1145
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,485
But that being said, this game

1146
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,779
turns and twists, and people say

1147
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,990
one thing and do another.

1148
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:04,584
>> For real?

1149
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,209
That's what they're telling you?

1150
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,294
>> Yeah.

1151
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,337
>> Here's the thing.

1152
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:12,592
Would you guys care if you guys

1153
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,302
all voted him and then I just

1154
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,345
voted, like, just someone?

1155
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:16,637
Because I...

1156
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,889
>> Yeah, no, I wouldn't care.

1157
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,349
I'd probably vote with you.

1158
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,393
>> Dreamz told me that Alex and

1159
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,187
Edgardo were talking about

1160
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,397
sending off Rocky before Lisi.

1161
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,940
Well, that leaves only one of

1162
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:28,566
previous Ravu, and they're just

1163
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,861
going to wipe us out.

1164
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,487
I got have to figure out a way

1165
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,572
to turn it around, and I think

1166
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,239
right now my man Dreamz, I trust

1167
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,324
him.

1168
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,076
I think he was left out in the

1169
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,245
other previous tribe, and so the

1170
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,080
opportunity to, you know, align

1171
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,248
myself with himself is the best

1172
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,458
thing I can do.

1173
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,417
>> Me and Rocky's personality,

1174
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,752
we don't bump heads like it

1175
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,961
appeared that it would, because

1176
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,087
I understand Rocky.

1177
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,172
That's how... that's who he is.

1178
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:51,756
That's how he talks, you know

1179
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,965
what I mean?

1180
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,008
That don't mean that he's mad at

1181
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,051
you and want to fight you, you

1182
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:55,843
get what I'm saying?

1183
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,886
>> Yeah.

1184
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,887
>> I think Rocky knows that he's

1185
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,180
on the chopping block tonight.

1186
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,515
Some of the boys think, "Hey,

1187
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,474
he's got a bad attitude; he's

1188
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,600
got to go."

1189
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,518
>> What's everybody crying

1190
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,311
about?

1191
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,772
>> Losing today.

1192
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,106
>> Just got to win tomorrow.

1193
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,982
>> Rocky throws a lot of false

1194
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:10,942
attitude, but it's not real

1195
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:11,818
attitude.

1196
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,110
It's not the real way he feels.

1197
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:13,653
It's just his personality.

1198
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,238
>> Right?

1199
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,572
>> We have to win tomorrow.

1200
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,824
>> Yeah.

1201
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,950
>> I never really got the chance

1202
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:19,325
to know Rocky.

1203
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,243
I would really like to get to

1204
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,245
know Rocky.

1205
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,205
So I feel I would rather Lisi

1206
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,374
leave if somebody was to leave,

1207
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,416
because then we'll still be

1208
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,171
strong, but just without Lisi.

1209
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,716
>> I hate tribal council.

1210
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,261
What do you think, bitch?

1211
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:38,886
>> I think you should (<i> no</i>

1212
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,637
<i>audio</i> ) push over a little bit,

1213
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,055
unless you want to make out with

1214
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:45,810
me (<i> no audio</i> ).

1215
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,686
To be honest with you, I've been

1216
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,186
a little nervous today.

1217
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,106
Out of all the tribal councils,

1218
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:50,940
I was the one pulling the

1219
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,608
strings in all the other ones.

1220
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,360
That's not the case this time.

1221
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,406
>> Yeah.

1222
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,282
>> I think Lisi's definitely

1223
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,701
going to go home, but who knows?

1224
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,787
I could go home today.

1225
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,500
>> Going into tribal is going to

1226
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,502
be like a cliffhanger situation,

1227
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,336
because even though we've all

1228
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,338
talked that I'm not going to get

1229
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,339
voted out, you never know what

1230
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,758
happens at the last minute.

1231
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,282
>> PROBST: So let's start with

1232
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:41,449
Lisi.

1233
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,367
When you weren't selected to be

1234
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,327
on either tribe, you had

1235
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,163
somewhat of a meltdown.

1236
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,080
>> Yeah, sure.

1237
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:48,664
I was looking forward to going

1238
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,248
home.

1239
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,416
I thought that was my exit.

1240
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,918
>> PROBST: So when you came back

1241
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,377
to this tribe, you had to be a

1242
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,754
little uneasy about how you

1243
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,422
would be welcomed.

1244
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,465
>> Um, I knew I was going to go

1245
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,301
back to a tribe that contained

1246
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,303
people from my old tribe, so I

1247
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,388
was really not concerned about

1248
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,183
general consensus of the tribe

1249
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:07,808
towards me, because I knew I was

1250
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,393
going to find a friend wherever

1251
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,686
I went.

1252
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,479
And from that thread, I would

1253
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,731
just, you know, start bringing

1254
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,650
myself up.

1255
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,734
>> PROBST: Dreamz, you watched

1256
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,401
Lisi out there.

1257
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,278
What was your reaction?

1258
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,739
>> Well, at first, when Lisi had

1259
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,323
the breakdown, I knew that she

1260
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,367
just wanted to quit the game.

1261
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,576
And I was like, "Man, we got to

1262
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,702
win so we don't have to get

1263
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,287
Lisi," because I didn't want her

1264
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,538
on our team if she was wanting

1265
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,539
to go home.

1266
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,540
But when she came back and she

1267
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,333
wasn't the same way she was when

1268
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,669
I seen her with the breakdown, I

1269
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,920
was happy about that, and I knew

1270
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,672
that we were ready for business.

1271
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,173
>> PROBST: Rocky, what's the

1272
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,549
feeling as tribal council starts

1273
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,467
to approach?

1274
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,468
Is everybody scurrying around,

1275
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,386
trying to make sure it's not

1276
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,387
them?

1277
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,430
>> I think it's in the back of

1278
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,556
people's minds, because you

1279
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,475
know, we just... we're a tight

1280
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,643
group, but we're a new group,

1281
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,811
you know what I mean?

1282
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,645
So I think everyone's a

1283
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,771
little... not really nervous,

1284
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,730
but it's always in the back of

1285
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,648
everybody's minds exactly what's

1286
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,983
going on.

1287
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:57,525
>> PROBST: So, Mookie, this

1288
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,986
tribe's strength being its

1289
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,154
physical strength and agility,

1290
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,572
how does that factor in to who

1291
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,241
you get rid of?

1292
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,158
>> It's hard choosing which

1293
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,159
person is going to go, because

1294
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,744
we're all so strong.

1295
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,413
And Lisi over here brings

1296
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,497
another aspect.

1297
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,957
Maybe we need a girl.

1298
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,250
So it makes it really difficult

1299
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,085
trying to figure out who to let

1300
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,045
go, because this whole physical

1301
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:18,713
thing hasn't really been working

1302
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,673
in our favor so far.

1303
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,632
So you have to look at it both

1304
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,593
ways, and I really don't know.

1305
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,761
>> PROBST: Rocky, can you trust

1306
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,596
these guys to be telling you the

1307
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,515
truth as we get ready to vote?

1308
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,350
>> Basically, you know what?

1309
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,393
I'm going with my gut right now.

1310
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,811
I trust certain people.

1311
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,062
That's all I can do.

1312
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:35,938
And then I just got to read

1313
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,023
everybody else, you know, see

1314
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:37,523
what I can do.

1315
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,400
>> PROBST: Lisi, does this tribe

1316
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,986
need to make any adjustments?

1317
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:42,987
You get up tomorrow morning;

1318
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,654
what's the first thing you're

1319
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,655
going to do?

1320
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,073
>> Look around and be like,

1321
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:46,615
"Ooh, God, I'm still here?"

1322
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,701
(<i> laughing</i> )

1323
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,577
Yeah, pretty much.

1324
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,620
We need to win.

1325
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:52,496
Whatever happens, we need to

1326
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,664
win.

1327
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,416
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to

1328
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,084
the vote.

1329
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:57,710
If, at this point, somebody has

1330
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,879
found the hidden immunity idol,

1331
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,255
and you need to play it tonight,

1332
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:02,298
you would present it to me

1333
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,758
before I read the votes.

1334
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,759
It is time to vote.

1335
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,094
Rocky, you're up.

1336
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,161
>> Because that's the way it's

1337
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,537
got to go.

1338
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:58,479
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1339
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,564
votes.

1340
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:11,951
If anybody has the hidden

1341
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:12,743
immunity idol and they want to

1342
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,619
play it, now is the time to do

1343
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,288
so.

1344
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,542
Okay, once the votes are read,

1345
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,668
the decision is final.

1346
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:21,502
The person voted out will be

1347
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,628
asked to leave the tribal

1348
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,464
council area immediately.

1349
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:30,469
First vote, Lisi.

1350
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:35,891
Lisi.

1351
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,768
Rocky.

1352
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,856
Two votes Lisi, one vote Rocky.

1353
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,400
Rocky.

1354
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:48,946
Two votes Lisi, two votes Rocky.

1355
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,865
Rocky.

1356
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,824
That's three votes Rocky, two

1357
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,576
votes Lisi.

1358
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:58,706
One vote left.

1359
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,541
Seventh person voted out and the

1360
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,377
first member of our jury, Rocky.

1361
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,838
You need to bring me your torch.

1362
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,007
>> Get it, boys, huh?

1363
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,346
>> PROBST: Rocky, the tribe has

1364
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,432
spoken.

1365
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,683
>> Be good, boys, huh?

1366
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,280
>> PROBST: Well, based on what I

1367
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,740
heard tonight, Rocky had no idea

1368
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,366
that was coming.

1369
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:34,950
If it could happen to him, it

1370
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,785
can happen to you.

1371
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,578
Grab your torches.

1372
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:37,953
Head back to camp.

1373
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,663
Good night.

1374
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,217
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1375
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,885
from our next episode.

1376
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,055
>> PROBST: Next time on

1377
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,765
<i>Survivor...</i>

1378
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,182
>> I'm going to cry.

1379
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,475
>> PROBST: ...things get tough

1380
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,226
for Lisi.

1381
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,727
>> This sucks.

1382
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,645
>> PROBST: The tribes learn a

1383
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,687
new skill.

1384
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,563
>> Boo is doing the whole white

1385
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,066
guy thing.

1386
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,442
>> PROBST: And at Ravu...

1387
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:09,109
>> We should just tear this

1388
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,027
place all apart.

1389
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,611
>> PROBST: ...the hunt for the

1390
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:11,737
idol gets dirty.

1391
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,321
>> We're digging for the idol

1392
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:12,863
while Lisi and Dreamz are

1393
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,698
sleeping.

1394
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,793
>> Ah!

1395
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,752
I'm extremely pissed off.

1396
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,002
I'm angry.

1397
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:27,628
They got me good, man.

1398
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,587
They got me really good.

1399
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,797
I didn't see anything coming.

1400
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,799
Then all of a sudden, boom, I

1401
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,758
get smacked in the mouth way

1402
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,718
cinder block.

1403
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,135
But you know what?

1404
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:35,761
Now I get to be on the jury, and

1405
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,596
hopefully none of those cats get

1406
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,224
the million bucks thanks to me.
