1
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:06,896
AUSTIN:
I need to be
the first to strike.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,965
I'm turning this
into a full-blown idol.

3
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:11,586
PROBST:
Previously onSurvivor...

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:12,655
BRUCE:
Boom.

5
00:00:12,758 --> 00:00:13,896
Hidden immunity idol, baby.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,137
In my hand.

7
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:17,310
This is freaking fantastic.
[laughs]

8
00:00:17,413 --> 00:00:19,448
You are my nu... Come on.
Co-Co-Come.

9
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:21,137
You are my number one.

10
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,206
KELLIE:
Bruce just follows
me around and, like,

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,827
refuses to let me be free.

12
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:26,586
And at this point,
I would be fine

13
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:27,793
with blindsiding Bruce.

14
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:29,103
PROBST:
This is it.

15
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:30,379
-JAKE: Bruce, Bruce!
-DEE: He's moving.

16
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:33,206
PROBST:
Julie's out.

17
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,620
Bruce wins individual immunity.

18
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:38,758
JAKE:
We all know
I'm the backup to Bruce.

19
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:40,241
We know I'm on the bottom.

20
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:43,862
KATURAH:
Jake is desperate.
He's not trying to hide it.

21
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:45,413
Everybody sees it.

22
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:49,931
DREW:
We can just
take her off the table,

23
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:52,310
and then the core four
can take charge.

24
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,620
If anybody has an advantage or
an idol and you want to play it.

25
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:56,896
JAKE:
Jeff.

26
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:00,689
Jake, you are...

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,206
...not safe.

28
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:06,965
Ninth person voted out

29
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,724
and the second member
of our jury: Kellie.

30
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:10,965
Whoa!

31
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:12,241
Sorry. Whoa.

32
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:13,827
What the hell, guys?

33
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:18,275
The tribe has spoken.

34
00:01:21,137 --> 00:01:23,137
♪ ♪

35
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:30,620
Cheers, Kel.

36
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:37,000
Love you, girl.

37
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:38,103
[Jake laughing]

38
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:44,655
I was just like, "Wow."

39
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:46,172
[laughs]

40
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,896
Good. I'm glad you have some,
uh, positive energy.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, yeah, Got to have positive
energy, man. I'm in the game.

42
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:52,275
How could I not
have positive energy?

43
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,448
Hi.

44
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:55,793
I'm Jake.
I'm still on Survivor.

45
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:57,758
[chuckles]
Didn't get voted out tonight.

46
00:01:57,862 --> 00:01:59,482
I was aware that I was

47
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,206
not reading people well,
but I was not aware

48
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,413
how bad I was reading people.
I had

49
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:09,378
no idea that
that would be Kellie.

50
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:11,206
I don't even want to say
I was left in the dark.

51
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,793
I wasn't even left
in the same dimension.

52
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:16,448
But now I have
a brand-new opportunity

53
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:19,379
to entirely change
the way I've been playing.

54
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:20,931
Knock on wood.

55
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,793
Jakey's not out of this.

56
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,172
EMILY:
Bruce, how are you feeling?

57
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:34,275
BRUCE: Um...

58
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:45,344
JULIE: Yep.

59
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:46,965
Then somebody
explain it to me so I know.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,137
-She was.
-DREW: Nobody wanted to tell you
because we thought that you guys

61
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:52,758
were, like, tight with her.

62
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:54,379
You would tell her and then
she'd turn things against us.

63
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:56,862
BRUCE:
Listen, uh, this is a game.

64
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:58,586
This is a part
of what things are.

65
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:00,206
I'm not gonna be...
I'm just...

66
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,137
I'm not salty against anybody.

67
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:04,206
At Tribal,
I was extremely shocked.

68
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,724
I had no idea

69
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:08,965
that the votes were gonna
go down the way that they did.

70
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,655
It's extremely scary to lose
your closest ally in this game.

71
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,586
But then
to find out that Kellie was

72
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,344
trying to,
you know, vote me out--

73
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,689
that was devastating.

74
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:21,551
So I'm under the understanding
now that I

75
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:25,827
was a target from Kellie
to try to get out.

76
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,448
DEE:
From what we've been
hearing, Kellie--

77
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:30,482
she always felt like
she was under your wing.

78
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,137
These are her words, yes.

79
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:34,620
Like, she kind of felt like
she was on house arrest by you.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,896
I didn't overreact,

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,758
but on the inside,
I'm-I'm panicking.

82
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:42,067
I'm thinking, like, you know,

83
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:44,551
"What the hell?"
My closest ally is gone.

84
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:47,448
And it's shocking to hear
that she felt like

85
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:50,275
I was overbearing.
That sucks.

86
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:53,448
That's not my personality.

87
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:00,655
Yeah, yeah. I mean, we said
that in the beginning, and...

88
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:01,965
-I...
-we meant it.

89
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,000
I mean, I meant it.

90
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:04,482
Yes.

91
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:08,137
It's so shocking
to me how hard it is to watch

92
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:12,931
my literal day one first friend
on Survivorget snuffed.

93
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:14,413
But then on the other side,

94
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:16,586
she's no longer a threat
for winning the game,

95
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,793
I probably have a jury vote
from her if I get

96
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:22,586
to the end of the game,
and my hands are clean.

97
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:26,000
But now we got to figure out
how to shake the game up

98
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:28,655
and maybe
get a bigger player out.

99
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:31,413
Okay. Okay.

100
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:34,068
Is Dee the biggest threat
on Reba?

101
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:35,103
A hundred percent.

102
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:36,172
We're sure we're sure?

103
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,586
-A hundred percent.
-Okay.

104
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,482
KENDRA:
Dee is a beast at challenges.

105
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,034
She's super social.

106
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:42,689
Dee is very, very likable.

107
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,413
KATURAH: Right now,

108
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:54,068
it's either go with old Reba
or go with old Belo.

109
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:55,862
And I've been
with old Belo since day one,

110
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,689
and that clearly
doesn't do anything for me.

111
00:04:57,793 --> 00:05:00,586
So for Reba,
I'm sure that I'm fifth,

112
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:02,758
but I'm the fifth
that can bring them information

113
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:05,103
from Belo and help them
knock off Belo people.

114
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:11,103
Mm. I figured. It's okay.

115
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:13,379
They're gonna come after us,
for sure.

116
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:15,068
Well, we do have two idols.

117
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,517
We can defend it
to a certain extent.

118
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,206
With Kellie gone, my amulet,
which started out as just

119
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,896
a three-way shared extra vote,

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,275
is now a full idol.

121
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:28,517
So I have a lot of firepower
to play with right now.

122
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,965
I've got two idols.

123
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,931
It doesn't shock me
that she wants to come after me.

124
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:34,379
I just didn't know if...

125
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,172
Right.

126
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:38,965
DREW:
Number one priority
is flushing the idol.

127
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:40,275
And...

128
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,758
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

129
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:43,551
-And Kendra needs to go, too.
-AUSTIN: So pretty much,

130
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,241
-we need to win
the next immunity challenge.
-Yep.

131
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,724
AUSTIN:
So right now,
my next step is to make sure

132
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:51,413
we get rid of Bruce,
who has an idol,

133
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,586
Jake, who is doing whatever
he could to find an idol,

134
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,413
and Kendra, who's now
going after our alliance.

135
00:05:58,517 --> 00:06:01,172
-Aw, we're still
at the same beach.
-I know.

136
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,931
-This is our home.
-This is it.

137
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:05,000
-We're defending our home.
-Yep.

BRUCE:
Now I'm in a little bit
of a weird mind space right now.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
To find out that Kellie

144
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,896
was trying to,
you know, vote me out.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,206
That's what others you think
were supposed to do, not Kellie.

146
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:32,862
Now it's becoming scary.

147
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:36,931
I'm officially
in a spot that I am...

148
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:41,724
Personally,
I don't know where I am.

149
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:44,862
KENDRA:
Morning, Brucey.

150
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,172
KATURAH:
Morning, Bruce.

151
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,517
Did you sleep
on the beach, Bruce?

152
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,931
I don't even want to, like,
talk about anything today.

153
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,068
I don't want to do anything.
I don't even

154
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:53,793
want to be by the fire
with them.

155
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:55,655
Even Jake.

156
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:58,206
Last night,
he was over-celebrating

157
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,482
when someone literally is having

158
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:02,517
a visceral moment
of just sadness.

159
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,793
KENDRA:
Got it.

160
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:05,931
-DREW: Nice, dude.
-KENDRA: Nice, Jake.

161
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,655
BRUCE:
But what irritates me the most

162
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:10,551
is that it doesn't make sense.

163
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,862
Kellie was my closest ally,
saying that I was overbearing

164
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:17,241
for them. Like, that's...
That... that doesn't feel good.

165
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:18,931
Like, that sucks.

166
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,965
-Oh!
-Oh!
-Yeah!

167
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:25,172
BRUCE:
And it's weird, because I have
my daughter back home, and

168
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:27,241
I don't treat them
any different than I treat her.

169
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:29,586
When I go back home, I'm gonna
ask my wife and my daughter,

170
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:30,931
"Am I overbearing?

171
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:33,655
Do you feel as if
I don't allow you to grow?"

172
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:35,309
Especially to my daughter.

173
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,000
And if she sees me as that way,
then I will make the changes

174
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,309
that are necessary
to make sure that she can live

175
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:43,965
a different life than what I...
than what I've gone through.

176
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:47,931
When I started in this world,

177
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:49,689
I started
in the foster care system.

178
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:53,068
My life isSurvivor.

179
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:55,379
My life has
always been that way.

180
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:57,517
So many kids come
in and out of the house.

181
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,896
You get to know them,
and then they leave.

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,379
So you build
a little bit of a thicker skin,

183
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:05,413
because I've been
through the muck.

184
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:07,724
In my normal, everyday life,

185
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:10,137
this doesn't happen to me
very often,

186
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:12,689
when I have to,
like, dig into my-my own

187
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,034
emotions.

188
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,310
Must be getting soft
in my old age.

189
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:19,896
[chuckles]

190
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:32,551
DREW: Bruce is kind of

191
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,068
in a-in a tempestuous place.

192
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:37,275
Today, he doesn't
want to work around camp.

193
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,275
-Just let them do it.
-JULIE: Ooh.

194
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,172
-I mean, you know what?
Somebody could take a chance.
-Yeah.

195
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,068
DREW:
He's obviously upset.
And I think

196
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:48,724
a lot of that
comes from the fact that

197
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:50,965
he's been playing
an imaginary game of Survivor

198
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,724
and now that imaginary
game of Survivor

199
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:54,275
has come down,
he has two choices.

200
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:57,241
Either A, confront
the reality of his situation--

201
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,137
which is pretty bleak-- or

202
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:00,827
reject that reality.

203
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,793
One of them
would be moving forward.

204
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,620
One of them
would be holding back an ego.

205
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:06,896
And for a guy like Bruce,
a lot of times,

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,448
it can be difficult to stop,
take a look at the crossroads

207
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,344
and say, "Maybe I went
the wrong direction."

208
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,896
-DREW: Yeah, true.
-EMILY: I know.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,517
I have this alliance with Austin
and Drew, but Drew and Austin

210
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,172
have a very close relationship
with their old Reba tribe,

211
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:34,482
and Dee and Austin have
been getting especially close.

212
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:36,482
And I wanted
to broach the subject about

213
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:37,896
getting her out sooner

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,206
rather than later.
It'd be a little bit

215
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,517
of a sign of-of,
"No, our true three

216
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,413
is with you, Emily,
not with somebody else."

217
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,241
So I think you can
get Bruce, Katurah,

218
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,482
Kendra and Jake
to put their votes on--

219
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,655
oh, I hate-- somebody like Dee.

220
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:58,034
Thing is with Dee
is she's kind of taking

221
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,896
the target
off of everybody right now...

222
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:03,689
DREW:
I kind of agree.

223
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,758
I still think that flushing
the idol is probably number one.

224
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:07,655
I agree.

225
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:08,758
Wow.

226
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:09,931
The hesitancy

227
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,344
on Austin and Drew's part
to kind of

228
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:13,206
cut down on
any of those old Reba numbers

229
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,103
definitely has me rethinking
my alliance with them.

230
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:16,551
I don't want to be

231
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:19,034
at the bottom
of a five-person alliance.

232
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,931
My-my only thought is if Dee
is in the final three, Dee wins.

233
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:23,896
-AUSTIN: Yeah.
-That's... Honestly, that's
my 100% thought right now.

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,344
-DREW: I agree.
-Oh, no, no, no.

235
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:27,068
Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:29,517
AUSTIN:
I completely understand
where she's coming from.

237
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,586
If I were Emily

238
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,241
and I saw my two closest allies

239
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:35,172
have equally close relationships
with two other players,

240
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,517
I would be terrified as well.

241
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,000
So the key right now
is to make sure

242
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:40,758
Emily's fears are dwindled down

243
00:11:40,862 --> 00:11:42,103
as low as possible

244
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:44,206
so that I can continue
working with both sides.

245
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,068
I don't know, honestly,
if I can bring myself

246

I love hanging out with her.

And I'm not ready

a little bit further.

to think a little bit.

KATURAH:
My head is going
a hundred miles an hour,

because what do those

really want
in my group of three?

282
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:18,620
Maybe I want to have
my alliance. Maybe I want

283
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:21,517
to have my enemies in this
group of three, because Bruce

284
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,827
is a huge target
and we're all working

285
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:24,275

with Austin and Emily.

me, Katurah, Austin.

This is a tricky team,
and if something were to happen

292
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,379
within that group of three,
I think Julie is the one to go.

Before we headed out for

What happened?

KATURAH:
Well, the tree mail

321
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:28,275
said something about
panic and anxiety.

that's what I felt.

how we would divide ourselves,

and there was
a lot of back and forth,

325

was the most fair.

Once all three players
are across,

342
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:31,310
you will race
to dig up three rope rungs.

The first two groups to finish
move on to the next phase.

344
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:38,586
Last group to finish is out.
No shot at immunity.

345
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:40,482
For the next stage...

346
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,827
...you will use those rope rungs
to build a rope bridge.

347
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:48,206
Once each person
is across their bridge,

348
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,965
you'll race to land three balls
on three very small rings.

349
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:57,413
First group to finish
moves on to the final round.

350
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,137
Losers out.
No shot at immunity.

351
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:03,344
For the final round,
you are no longer a team.

352
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:05,723
You will now
compete against each other.

353
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,586
You're gonna have
your arms outstretched

354
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,827
with your fingertips pressed
against two wooden discs.

355
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,619
If at any point a disc drops...

356
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,137
...you're out.

357
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:20,103
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

358
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,758
guaranteed
a spot in the final eight.

359
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:24,758
Losers, Tribal Council,
where somebody will be

360
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:28,205
the tenth person voted out and
the third member of our jury.

361
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,034
In addition,
you're playing for a reward.

362
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,310
-Yeah!
-What?!
-Oh, my God.

363
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:35,379
-PROBST: Want to know
what you're playing for?
-ALL: Yes!

364
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:39,068
The group that makes it
to the final stage--

365
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:41,586
regardless who wins
individual immunity--

366
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,586
the three of you
will go to the sanctuary,

367
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,896
-Oh!
-where good things happen,

368
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,827
and enjoy an afternoon
of rotisserie chicken.

369
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:50,827
-Oh, my God.
-I like good things.
I like good things.

370
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:52,448
I like good things.
Good things are good.

371
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:53,931
PROBST:
Worth playing for?

372
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,000
-Hell yes.
-Yeah, baby.
-PROBST: All right.

373
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:57,620
Oh, there is one other twist.

374
00:17:57,724 --> 00:17:59,482
-Oh.
-Oh, Jeff.

375
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:00,827
PROBST:
Back to that panic, Katurah.

376
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:03,275
Yeah, and anxiety.
Don't forget that part.

377
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:06,586
-The first group that's out...
-Oh, no.

378
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,586
-all three players
-KATURAH: Oh, no.

379
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:10,620
will lose their vote...

380
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,310
-You got to be kidding me.
-Whoa!

381
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,551
PROBST:
...at tonight's Tribal Council.

382
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,724
You will take a journey

383
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,206
where you will have a chance
to earn it back.

384
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, my gosh.

385
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,827
PROBST:
So, Austin, what does that do?

386
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:26,000
Just the thought that
there could be three votes

387
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,517
not in play tonight?

388
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,965
It puts any plan that anyone had
out the window.

389
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:36,620
Clearly, big stakes
on day 17 in Survivor45.

390
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,586
Let's get ready and do this.

391
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:40,000
KATURAH:

Big stakes on Day 17.

394
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:54,517
Go.

395
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,896
It's Emily, Bruce and Jake

396
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,103
going across
the first balance beam.

397
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,379
-You got to grab a disc
and get to the end.
-KATURAH: There you go.

398
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:04,241
-AUSTIN: Nice.

You're good, Red. Go.

403
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:12,448
-Whoa. [grunts]
-PROBST: There goes Katurah.

00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,275
No, Katurah, back!

405
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:15,862
-No, no, Katurah.
Back, back, back, back.
-PROBST: Back, Katurah!

406
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:19,275
Julie struggling. Julie's off.
She's got to go back.

00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:21,655
Here's Dee navigating that beam.

408
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:23,379

Kendra's good.

421
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,068
You cannot trap that ball,
cannot use your hand.

422
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:52,344
Got to get across that beam.

423
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:55,034
Jake gonna struggle. He's
got to go back to that beam.

424
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:58,000
Austin doing a nice job.

425
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:00,655

426
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:02,862
-Let's go, baby!
-Kendra, you're good.

00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:05,793

-Jake for Red.
-BRUCE: You got it. Nice job.

430
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:13,517
PROBST:
Jake has got to get to the end
before anybody else can try.

431
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,068
He's struggling again.
It's not gonna do it.

432
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:17,724
Jake's gonna
have to go back again.

433
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:19,758

-Oh, thank God.

437

close to the end.

438
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:30,103

-Yes! Go, baby!

439
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:35,413
PROBST:
It's now Emily the last person
for Blue. Blue is in the lead.

440
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:37,000
Yellow on their tail.

441
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,000
Red in dead last.
Jake drops again.

442
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:41,000
He's got to go back.

443
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:43,689
Bruce drops.
He's got to go back.

444
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:45,758
You're good.
Start digging, Blue.

445
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:48,931
You're looking for three
rope rungs at four stations.

446
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:52,482
Jake got
a little momentum this time.

447
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:55,137
Can he get across?

448
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,206
You're good, Jake. Go, Dee.

449
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,551
Bruce the last person
for Yellow.

450
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:02,482
Red trying to play catch-up now.

451
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,379
-Yes, yes!
-You're good, Bruce.

452
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:05,758

455
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,965
Yellow can start digging.
Now the pressure is on Drew.

456
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:14,310
-He's got to go for broke.
-Focus, Drew, focus.

457
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:18,103
PROBST:
You're looking for three
rope rungs at four stations--

458
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:20,862

one will not have one.

459
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:23,068

PROBST:

464
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:34,862
Uh, one for three.

Oh, that's it?

466
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:38,275

-Look at that. Dead last.
-Got one here.

471
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:48,551
Red is in it now
with a second rope rung.

472
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:50,655
It is Yellow
with nothing right now.

473
00:21:50,758 --> 00:21:53,137
Three people
are gonna lose their votes.

474
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:55,724
Right now, that looks like
Kendra, Julie and Bruce.

475
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:57,586
-No way.
-All right, one.

476
00:21:57,689 --> 00:21:59,965

DEE:
Let's go, guys. Keep going.

492
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,344
PROBST:
It would be
a huge comeback for Yellow,

493
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,896
if they can find
that last rope rung.

494
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,896

00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:49,827
come up empty-handed.

501
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:50,965
Where was it?

Vote is gone.

You're gonna have to earn it
on a journey this afternoon.

509
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,482

even though you just competed

681
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:19,172
against each other,
if there's a consolation prize,

682
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:22,551
-you're gonna go
celebrate at the sanctuary.
-Yeah. That's a big one.

683
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:24,034
Some nice chicken.

684
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:26,689
Grab your stuff, head out,
enjoy your afternoon.

685
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:30,344
-You will return to camp
in time for Tribal Council.
-Good job, guys.

686
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:32,206
Thanks, Jeff.
That was fun.

687
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,931
[chuckles]

688
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:40,448
-Drew.
-PROBST: All right,
Drew, Jake, Dee--

689
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:43,551
no sanctuary,
but you retain your vote.

690
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:45,482
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

691
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:46,724
Bye, guys.

692
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:48,344
See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

693
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,586
Emily, how does this potentially

694
00:31:53,689 --> 00:31:56,758
change the game, knowing
that you, Katurah and Austin,

695
00:31:56,862 --> 00:31:58,724
as of now, don't have a vote?

696
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:01,551
What does that do for everybody
else who's scrambling now?

697
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:03,310
Yeah, right now,
four is the majority,

698
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:04,862
so everybody
who just walked off is,

699
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,413
in their head,
doing the calculus.

700
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:08,137
"Okay, let's operate
under the assumptions,

701
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:09,827
"these three don't have a vote.

702
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,827
Who am I working with
to get four tonight?"

703
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,689
And, uh, the pressure's
really gonna be on us

704
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:15,172
to earn our votes back.

705
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:17,172
Otherwise, I think it's fair
to say, all of our names

706
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:18,655
are on the chopping block.

707
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:20,172
PROBST:
All right, Emily,
Katurah, Austin,

708
00:32:20,275 --> 00:32:21,413
here's what's gonna happen.

709
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:22,793
You're gonna leave here,
take a journey.

710
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,620
You will have a chance
to earn your vote back

711
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:26,724
and you will be back at camp
in time for Tribal Council.

712
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:29,344
Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight at Tribal.

713
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,103
[groans]

714
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:32,448
KATURAH:
I feel like everything has just

715
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,172
hit me like a ton of bricks.

716
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:37,793
Bruce has now got his second
immunity win in a row.

717
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:39,206
I don't have a vote.

718
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,724
I'm going into a journey

719
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:42,655
that I've been hearing
terrible things about,

720
00:32:42,758 --> 00:32:44,379
and add icing to the cake,

721
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:45,827
I don't get chicken.

722
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,827
[laughs]

723
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:49,655
That's my life today.

724
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:58,551
♪ ♪

725
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,344
JAKE: Yeah.

726
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,931
That... that freaking sucked.

727
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:08,137
-DEE: Yeah.
-DREW: Ugh!

728
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,034
Bruce winning
another immunity is tough.

729
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:11,862
He has that idol which

730
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:14,206
he's hanging onto,
like, viciously, greedily,

731
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,517
and we can't flush it.

732
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,241
-Didn't lose our vote, at least.
-DREW: Yeah.
-JAKE: Yeah.

733
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:19,724
DREW:
Could have been a lot worse.

734
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:22,655
On the other hand,
if you come back to camp, not go

735
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:24,482
into the sanctuary,
not go into the journey,

736
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,482
you're in the middle ground,
and so you have some nice time

737
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:28,241
to relax, to nourish yourself.

738
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:30,724
-You want to eat some rice?
-Hell, yeah. Rice.
-JAKE: Sure.

739
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:33,724
DREW:
But also, you can't really
begin strategizing

740
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:36,034
because you're waiting for that
power group at the Sanctuary

741
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:37,551
to come back with their plan.

742
00:33:37,655 --> 00:33:39,689
DEE: Yeah, they got rotisserie
chickens, and then we got

743
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:41,275
-three extra scoops
for ourselves, baby.
-DREW: Yeah.

744
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:43,000
-JAKE: We got
a little extra ourselves.
-Absolutely.

745
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:44,413
DREW:
And then you're also
waiting to find out

746
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:46,793
what votes
will be available to you

747
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:48,655
from the people on the journey.

748
00:33:51,241 --> 00:33:52,862
DREW: Yes.

749
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,551
I think there's a potential
for all of them to get it.

750
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:56,275
I think there's a potential for
all of them to lose it. Like...

751
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:58,827
-Yeah, or maybe
just one have it, either, even.
-Yeah.

752
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:01,379
So there could be six votes
or nine.

753
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:02,931
-Yeah.
-Wow.

754
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:04,413
DREW:
So, it's all up in the air.

755
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:05,931
You're kind of
in this uncomfortable,

756
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:07,517
like, puberty middle zone

757
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,862
where you got to wait for one
of the outcomes to happen.

758
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,724
How are you feeling after,
uh, having the shock wear off

759
00:34:12,827 --> 00:34:14,620
about last night?

760
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:16,447
I mean, obviously, I'm wicked
happy to still be in the game.

761
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:18,447
-You know what I mean?
-DEE: Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

762
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:20,482
I just got to figure out
what I do moving forward.

763
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:22,482
-DREW: Yeah. Where to...
-Kind of like...

764
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:24,206
I mean, I'm basically
a free agent right now,

765
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,551
and I don't think
that's a secret.

766
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:26,931
-DREW: That's a thought, yeah.
-DEE: Yeah.

767
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,655
I'm here. I don't want
to, like, force anything.

768
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:30,793
I don't want to, like, freak out
like I did yesterday.

769
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:32,724
Prior to the last Tribal,

770
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:36,034
my alliance was supposed
to be original Belo members,

771
00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:38,551
but original Belo
voted for me.

772
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:41,827
So, if things stay the same,
I'm still on the bottom,

773
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:45,172
and my game plan right now is
to build the trust with people

774
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:46,862
that I haven't really
worked with before.

775
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:49,275
If there's any way I can build
trust with you guys, just

776
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,344
-let me know.
I'm open to conversing.
-Yup.

777
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:54,793
So right now, I'm trying
to learn from my mistakes.

778
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:56,137
Kind of a tough thing
to do mid-game,

779
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:57,517
but this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,

780
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,965
so I have to do it now.

781
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:00,413
I don't like to think that

782
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,862
my foot has come off the gas
at all, but

783
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:05,275
I'm turning the high beams on.

784
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:07,862
-Oh, that's ready.
It's still kind of hot, but...
-DREW: Yeah.

785
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:13,655
Me too.

786
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,310
Yeah. Exactly, yeah, yeah.

787
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,068
-You're at our mercy. [laughs]
-Yeah.

788
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:21,551
I swear, Austin better get
his damn vote...

789
00:35:21,655 --> 00:35:23,241
-Oh, for real.
-'cause that's gonna be...

790
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:24,620
We're gonna probably have
to play an idol for sure.

791
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:26,655
Yeah, um, if we do,

792
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,137
I think that we should play
the idols on you and Austin.

793
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:29,724
Yeah, we'll wait.
We'll wait to see, yeah.

794
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,379
-For sure.
-'Cause they're definitely
gonna come

795
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:32,827
-for me and Austin
for sure, yeah.
-Yeah, I think so.

796
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:34,310
And then
if we're in the majority,

797
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:36,482
who would you want to take out?

798
00:35:36,586 --> 00:35:38,517
-Kendra.
-Okay, I think the same thing.

799
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,310
DEE:
The fact that Kendra did not win
made my entire year.

800
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,310
DEE: She got to go

801
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:46,034
'cause she's stirring up the pot

802
00:35:46,137 --> 00:35:47,896
and she's putting my name
out there.

803
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,137
So, yeah, okay, Kendra,
get some rotisserie chicken,

804
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:52,758
but you're gonna be eating more
of that soon

805
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:55,103
when you're out of this game.
[laughs]

806
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:57,310
I definitely am full on rice.
That was good.

807
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:58,724
Oh, yeah,
you ate the whole thing.

808
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:00,068
-Did I really?
-Yeah.

809
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:01,862
-Are you kidding me?
-[laughs]

810
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:03,620
DREW:
Oh, my God. I ate it all.

811
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:05,413
But we have some put aside
for him, don't we?

812
00:36:05,517 --> 00:36:07,103
-DEE [laughing]: No, I didn't.
-Oh, my God.

813
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,310
-This is all.
-I thought we had some put aside
for the guy.

814
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:11,655
DEE:
I'm chilling right now.

815
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:13,068
There's nothing else
for me to do.

816
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:14,620
I'm just gonna
be mentally prepared

817
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:16,689
for when everyone
starts rushing back to camp.

818
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:18,931
We got some rice for you.
Some of it burned.

819
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:21,137
-It was inedible.
-It was inedible, yeah.

820
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,275
-DREW: A lot of
the burned stuff got tossed.
-Oh, no worries.

821
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,172
DEE:
We did not get
some rotisserie chicken.

822
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,655
All done yet?

823
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:28,689
DEE:
But we got a ton of rice that

824
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:32,275
Jake didn't eat because we ate
more than he thinks we ate.

825
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:35,896
-Appreciate it. Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

826
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:39,655
KENDRA: Oh. Oh.

827
00:36:39,758 --> 00:36:43,068
That is just one
big ol' chicken.

828
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:45,620
JULIE:
Oh, look at that
roasted chicken.

829
00:36:45,724 --> 00:36:46,965
Thank you, Jeff!

830
00:36:47,068 --> 00:36:48,931
Oh... my God.

831
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:52,068
I have not eaten chicken
for 15 years,

832
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:55,068
and chickens
are my favorite animal!

833
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,965
But I'm about
to eat you right now.

834
00:36:58,413 --> 00:37:00,344
-Oh.
-Sweet little chicken.
Thank you for

835
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:01,931
giving us your...

836
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:03,965
-This is for you.
-energy.

837
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:05,172
BRUCE:
There it is-- the most beautiful

838
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:07,724
rotisserie chicken just

839
00:37:07,827 --> 00:37:10,482
begging to be feasted upon.

840
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:11,862
No utensils whatsoever.

841
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:13,896
And I just start
devouring this thing.

842
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,896
KENDRA:
Oh!

843
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,068
-Yes!
-JULIE: There you go.

844
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:19,758
Cheers, you guys.

845
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,793
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
-Great win today.

846
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:22,517
-Absolutely. Oh.
-Awesome job.

847
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,172
BRUCE:
I got grease and gristle
and a chicken wing

848
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,034
all over my hand, and

849
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:28,379
that is a stark contrast
in regards to this morning.

850
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:31,965
It just revived the reason
why I'm here.

851
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:33,758
I'm playing this game
for my family,

852
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:35,586
and I couldn't leave
my negative space this morning.

853
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:37,310
I just couldn't get out of it.

854
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:39,931
But sitting there, you know,
with this big ol' drumstick

855
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:42,793
and immunity
and a hidden immunity idol,

856
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:44,689
and knowing
that I'm safe tonight

857
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:46,310
made it so much...

858
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:48,310
made the chicken taste
so much better.

859
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,586
Mmm. That's really good.

860
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:52,172
It's really good.

861
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:55,310
I'm really nervous
about tonight.

862
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:57,620
-So...
-JULIE: So what are y'all
thinking? Like, what...

863
00:37:57,724 --> 00:37:59,862
How do y'all see the end?
What is next for y'all?

864
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:03,000
How are you
with your Reba people?

865
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:07,551
Um, I just feel like I'm on
the bottom of the Reba people

866
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:09,310
and I got to make a move
at some point.

867
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,103
KENDRA:
Who do you think is at the top
of the Reba people?

868
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,551
-I don't know.
-I'm kind of nervous

869
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:13,931
-about the Austin-Dee thing.
-What do you think?

870
00:38:14,034 --> 00:38:16,862
-Ooh. Maybe.
-I think

871
00:38:16,965 --> 00:38:18,862
they're, like, secretly in love.

872
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:21,724
Which I love, and I want them
to get married after. [laughs]

873
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:23,034
-BRUCE: Mm-hmm.
-JULIE: I mean,

874
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:24,517
-Dee's my girl, but...
-KENDRA: Yeah.

875
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,448
-I hear what you're saying.
-KENDRA: Yeah.

876
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:28,448
JULIE:
I know Kendra wants Dee out.

877
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,482
She just wears it.

878
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:32,862
All of her emotion.
It's obvious.

879
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:35,000
But I do not want Dee out.

880
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:37,068
I want to go
to the end with Dee.

881
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:39,724
I would never write her name.
Oh, my gosh.

882
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:41,206
Uh, here's-here's what
I would like to also propose.

883
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,551
Okay. Yeah, okay.

884
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:45,275
I would love
to write Jake's name again.

885
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:47,034
Dee thinks Kendra's got to go,

886
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:50,724
but I would like
to see Jake go out next.

887
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:54,137
I am fine with the easy votes
right now. Plus,

888
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:55,517
he wrote my name down.

889
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,827
Like, he obviously doesn't want
to work with me.

890
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:59,241
Listen, if you want Jake...

891
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:01,413
-KENDRA: We want Jake.
-Then you got...
you'll get Jake.

892
00:39:01,517 --> 00:39:02,931
BRUCE:
I'll tell you this.

893
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:04,344
Tribal lines are gone

894
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,758
because this game is fluid,

895
00:39:05,862 --> 00:39:07,172
it has to keep moving,

896
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:09,000
and Jake has no footing
with anyone now.

897
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:11,413
I'm not going down
with the ship, so,

898
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,000
if Julie wants to vote Jake,
then that's fine.

899
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:16,724
I'm okay with Jake going
because he is unpredictable.

900
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:18,482
Yeah.

901
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:22,034
KENDRA:
Julie throws out Jake,
and to my surprise,

902
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:24,034
Bruce agrees with Julie.

903
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:26,965
And in the moment, I'm like,
"Okay, anyone but me."

904
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:29,413
I'm just wondering who's gonna
get their vote back.

905
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:31,241
Yeah.

906
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:32,758
KENDRA:
The three people who
lost their vote-- we don't know

907
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:34,448
if they have their vote,
so we kind of have

908
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:36,000
to get a name,

909
00:39:36,103 --> 00:39:38,172
which maybe only six people
are gonna be voting for.

910
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:42,448
And so, Jake kind of seems
like a easy target.

911
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:43,689
He doesn't have
a Shot in the Dark.

912
00:39:43,793 --> 00:39:45,000
We know he doesn't have an idol.

913
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:46,344
Let's send him home.

914
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:48,413
So, us three are on Jake?

915
00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:50,413
-Until you tell me different.
-Perfect.

916
00:39:50,517 --> 00:39:52,620
JULIE:
If I can believe
Bruce and Kendra

917
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,724
that we all write Jake,
that's music to my ears.

918
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,448
That's best case scenario
for me.

919
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:59,758
I just don't see it
going that easy.

920
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:10,758
-Oh, boy.
-Okay.

921
00:40:18,103 --> 00:40:19,517
-AUSTIN: All right.
-Let's do it.

922
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:25,758
EMILY:
The vote inSurvivor--
it's everything.

923
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:27,068
It's your life inSurvivor.

924
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:28,586
If you don't have a vote,

925
00:40:28,689 --> 00:40:30,344
you're totally useless
to everybody here, so,

926
00:40:30,448 --> 00:40:31,931
if there's any opportunity
to get your vote back, you need

927
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:33,551
to do everything in your power
to get your vote back.

928
00:40:33,655 --> 00:40:35,896
The only thing that's going
on in my head is, "Don't choke,

929
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,344
"don't choke, don't choke.

930
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:38,758
"Just finish the journey,

931
00:40:38,862 --> 00:40:40,172
"complete whatever
you need to complete

932
00:40:40,275 --> 00:40:41,931
and get your vote back."

933
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:47,000
AUSTIN: My mind is racing,
and I'm hoping,

934
00:40:47,103 --> 00:40:49,206
I'm just hoping
it's something in my wheelhouse.

935
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,586
I really don't want
to leave it to chance.

936
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:54,137
-Okay.
-KATURAH: Good luck, guys.

937
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:56,275
Yup, good luck.

938
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:16,965
Basically, the note says,
"You need to solve

939
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:18,517
"this logic math problem

940
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,827
in order to get your vote back."

941
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:21,241
And in my mind, I'm like, "Okay,

942
00:41:21,344 --> 00:41:23,827
this actually kind of is
in my wheelhouse."

943
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:35,517
Oh, boy.
All right, let's see.

944
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,827
Basically, it's nine, eight,

945
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:41,724
seven, six, five, four, three,
two, one equals 100.

946
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:43,000
And you have to place

947
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:44,965
three plus signs
and one minus sign

948
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:48,689
in order
to make that equation equal 100.

949
00:41:48,793 --> 00:41:49,620
But there's so many

950
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:50,620
different combinations.

951
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:52,103
Where do I even begin?

952
00:41:52,206 --> 00:41:53,413
♪ ♪

953
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:54,724
And with

954
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:55,862
the time ticking,

955
00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:57,724
it's stressful.

956
00:41:57,827 --> 00:41:59,137
I am freaking out.

957
00:42:00,862 --> 00:42:01,896
[mumbling]

958
00:42:05,793 --> 00:42:08,655
KATURAH:
It literally is,
at its core, just

959
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:10,241
a basic math problem.

960
00:42:10,344 --> 00:42:12,689
I can add to 100.
That's an easy, round number.

961
00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:15,827
Sure. But we have three minutes
to complete the entire equation.

962
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:18,000
Plus, the fact
that you don't know

963
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,137
how the numbers

964
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:20,482
should be combined

965
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:23,034
or subtracted
or added together.

966
00:42:23,137 --> 00:42:24,724
That's what makes it difficult.

967
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:26,448
Ugh! Okay.

968
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:35,689
EMILY:
Immediately, I...
the panic strikes me,

969
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:39,172
because if there's one thing I'm
terrible at, it's mental math.

970
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:40,275
My mind just

971
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:41,448
goes black.

972
00:42:42,482 --> 00:42:43,965
There's a conception

973
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:46,379
that because
I'm an investment analyst, that

974
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:47,724
I'm gonna be able
to crunch numbers

975
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:49,034
in my head really quickly.

976
00:42:49,137 --> 00:42:50,379
I've never been capable of it.

977
00:42:50,482 --> 00:42:51,482
In fact, it's always been
a struggle of mine.

978
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:53,310
My hands are physically

979
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:55,310
shaking from the nerves.

980
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:57,482
It's like my mind
can't function.

981
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:03,034
AUSTIN:
Math is something
that I'm kind of strong with.

982
00:43:03,137 --> 00:43:05,344
You might not be able
to tell by looking at me.

983
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:07,758
I might just look like
this surfer, brawny dude,

984
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:09,310
but I also don't look
like a typical MBA student.

985
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:11,758
And this is gonna be

986
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:14,827
a mental task that I feel like I
have a good shot at completing.

987
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:17,448
Okay, we're close. We're close.

988
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:18,793
So I start plugging in pluses

989
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,689
and minuses, and didn't work,

990
00:43:21,793 --> 00:43:23,137
didn't work,

991
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:25,689
didn't work,
didn't work, didn't work.

992
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:27,310
I'm running out of time,
running out of time.

993
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:32,793
KATURAH:
I have seven or eight
digits completed,

994
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:34,344
and there's only three left.

995
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,620
And I am like, "Just zone in.

996
00:43:36,724 --> 00:43:39,517
"Just get these last three,
figure out how they go,

997
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,413
and you'll be good."
But I'm looking at the time.

998
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:43,241
Oh, Lord.

999
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:46,724
And then, I switched from kind
of being methodical to saying,

1000
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:48,965
"Holy crap,
the time's running out."

1001
00:43:49,068 --> 00:43:50,896
And then
I kind of had brain freeze.

1002
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,103
Ugh!

1003
00:43:54,206 --> 00:43:56,448
So close!

1004
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,172
This means
I really don't have a vote.

1005
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:00,758
Got it, got it, got it,
got it, got it. Okay, okay.

1006
00:44:00,862 --> 00:44:03,689
Minus 76.

1007
00:44:03,793 --> 00:44:07,137
I have, like, 15 seconds left.
I quickly

1008
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:09,413
scribble in the pluses,
the minuses equals 100.

1009
00:44:09,517 --> 00:44:12,551
Hundred. [sighs]

1010
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:14,241
So, I open up the answer,

1011
00:44:14,344 --> 00:44:15,758
and I check it.

1012
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:19,034
Let's go!

1013
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,275
All my plus and minuses
checked out.

1014
00:44:24,379 --> 00:44:25,482
And I am freaking out.

1015
00:44:25,586 --> 00:44:27,827
Oh, my gosh.

1016
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,103
Wow.

1017
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:31,034
Ah. I didn't want to get

1018
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:34,862
made fun of by all my MBA
friends for screwing that up.

1019
00:44:39,586 --> 00:44:40,758
EMILY:
When I look at the solution,

1020
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:42,413
I mean, I wasn't even close.

1021
00:44:42,517 --> 00:44:45,137
I write something random in
'cause I'm running out of time.

1022
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:48,000
Honestly, it's mortifying.
I... Afterwards,

1023
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:50,241
I just wanted to curl up
into a little ball and die.

1024
00:44:50,344 --> 00:44:53,931
I'm embarrassed to call myself
an investment analyst right now

1025
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:55,344
that I didn't get this,

1026
00:44:55,448 --> 00:44:57,000
and I have
to reap the consequences now,

1027
00:44:57,103 --> 00:44:59,241
which is I don't
get a vote tonight.

1028
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:01,103
This is absolutely
one of the worst times

1029
00:45:01,206 --> 00:45:02,517
in the game for me
to lose my vote,

1030
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,896
because if I had my vote
right now,

1031
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,517
I could be the person who is

1032
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,724
making the decision about
who is best to go for my game.

1033
00:45:07,827 --> 00:45:10,137
But I-I robbed myself
of that today

1034
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,241
when I failed
to solve a math problem.

1035
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,931
Survivorcan be a brutal game,

1036
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:22,586
bring you lower
than you ever want to go.

1037
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:24,586
But if you want a life-changing
adventure, this is it.

1038
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,206
Apply to be on Survivor.

1039
00:45:32,103 --> 00:45:33,655
JAKE: Do you want to talk, like,

1040
00:45:33,758 --> 00:45:35,172
-long-term? Yeah, yeah.
-Endgame? Yeah.

1041
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,275
Like, who...

1042
00:45:37,379 --> 00:45:39,172
We got to wait and see
who lost their vote, what the...

1043
00:45:39,275 --> 00:45:40,206
-what the competition's
gonna be.
-I know. Yeah.

1044
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,758
'Cause it could be...

1045
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:43,172
It literally could be, like,
a six-person vote tonight.

1046
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:45,000
I know. That's the crazy part.

1047
00:45:45,103 --> 00:45:46,517
I do feel in danger.

1048
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,862
I always got to believe

1049
00:45:47,965 --> 00:45:49,275
there's a possibility
that I can go next,

1050
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,275
especially
after the vote last night.

1051
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:53,000
-What do you think?
-You think there's any world

1052
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:54,517
that doesn't involve
getting me out?

1053
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,482
-Uh, yeah, I think
there's a lot of worlds.
-Yeah.

1054
00:45:56,586 --> 00:46:00,275
That could mean Katurah,
it could mean Kendra.

1055
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:02,517
I feel like your threat level
is pretty low right now.

1056
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,448
Whatever you come up with,
man, like,

1057
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:08,068
-I can be an assistance,
but I'm open to anything.
-Yeah.

1058
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:09,965
JAKE:
I'm trying to make people
feel comfortable

1059
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:11,586
around me and feel like

1060
00:46:11,689 --> 00:46:13,241
they can use me.

1061
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:15,172
I do got to act a little bit
like a dog out here. You know?

1062
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:16,655
"What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

1063
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:18,586
"You want to cook?
You need some space, whatever?"

1064
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:21,517
But... I think
that's the move right now.

1065
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,793
-Honestly, like,
between me and you, I think...
-Really?

1066
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,931
I actually have
a similar thought.

1067
00:46:29,517 --> 00:46:30,965
DREW:
You think that's them?

1068
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:32,275

EMILY: I'm feeling not great

1074
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,724
about my position in this game
coming back to camp.

1075
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:53,000
Welcome home.

1076
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:56,241
EMILY:
It's the first time in a while
that I've really felt

1077
00:46:56,344 --> 00:47:00,689
on the outs and like
I'm not doing anything right.

1078
00:47:00,793 --> 00:47:02,586
It feels like
my old days back at Lulu.

1079
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:05,724
Well, journeys aren't fun.
It turns out they suck.

1080
00:47:05,827 --> 00:47:08,482
Um, it was basically
just a big math problem.

1081
00:47:08,586 --> 00:47:10,344
I mean, long story short,
none of us have a vote.

1082
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:11,931
-Yeah, and...
-I wasn't even close.

1083
00:47:12,034 --> 00:47:13,448
Just pure panic.

1084
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:15,655
It was an absolutely
miserable experience.

1085
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:17,689
It was just awful.

1086
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,275
We're sorry that we couldn't
pull it out for you guys.

1087
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,551
We know that it sucks
to have three people

1088
00:47:21,655 --> 00:47:22,758
with no vote,
and I really did try.

1089
00:47:22,862 --> 00:47:24,034
-DREW: Don't worry at all.
-Right.

1090
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:25,931
AUSTIN:
My lie of not having a vote

1091
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:27,586
was because
I don't want everybody

1092
00:47:27,689 --> 00:47:30,000
to know Reba has the numbers.

1093
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:31,620
But I always come clean

1094
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:32,827
to my alliance of four.

1095
00:47:32,931 --> 00:47:35,241
And I think that's
really the reason

1096
00:47:35,344 --> 00:47:37,931
why we've been so strong
throughout the game is because

1097
00:47:38,034 --> 00:47:40,793
they know I'm gonna
tell them the truth.

1098
00:47:40,896 --> 00:47:42,482
Y'all really think
I'm gonna let us go

1099
00:47:42,586 --> 00:47:44,896
-into Tribal
in a three-three deadlock, baby?
-Of course not.

1100
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,310
-You got it?
-I have it.

1101
00:47:46,413 --> 00:47:48,000
-[Dee laughs]
-DREW: Oh, my God.

1102
00:47:48,103 --> 00:47:49,689
DEE: Austin has his vote,

1103
00:47:49,793 --> 00:47:52,206
which is so freakin' awesome,
because without his vote,

1104
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,896
we would not
have the numbers tonight.

1105
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,655
Yeah, I'm kind of smart.
I'm kind of smart.

1106
00:47:55,758 --> 00:47:57,551
I know. Look at you. What?

1107
00:47:57,655 --> 00:48:01,482
-Yeah.
-You, me, Julie, Drew.

1108
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:07,965
Yeah.

1109
00:48:08,068 --> 00:48:09,551
DEE:
So now, there's seven people

1110
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:11,310
who are eligible to vote,
and obviously,

1111
00:48:11,413 --> 00:48:12,896
the four of us
are gonna vote together.

1112
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,551
And I know that Kendra's
coming for me, so right now

1113
00:48:15,655 --> 00:48:17,896
that I have the numbers,
I have to take Kendra out.

1114
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:21,344
Okay.

1115
00:48:24,448 --> 00:48:25,758
Well, Kendra was like,
"Well, I want Dee."

1116
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,413
I said... I said,
"I'm gonna be honest with you.

1117
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:28,620
I won't write Dee."

1118
00:48:28,724 --> 00:48:31,310
-Yeah.
-I said, "Can I write Jake?"

1119
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:33,137
And then Bruce goes,
"Well, I'm fine with Jake."

1120
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:36,310
And Kendra was like,
"I'm fine with Jake."

1121
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,862
-So we will have them think
it's Jake then.
-And?

1122
00:48:38,965 --> 00:48:40,620
And we go and vote Kendra out.

1123
00:48:40,724 --> 00:48:43,379
JULIE: At the sanctuary
with Kendra and Bruce,

1124
00:48:43,482 --> 00:48:46,241
we all agreed on Jake,
and Dee's like,

1125
00:48:46,344 --> 00:48:48,655
"Kendra's got to go."

1126
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:51,620
I'm annoyed because I'm like,
"Okay, I'm working

1127
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:56,551
Bruce and Kendra
to get Jake out," so,

1128
00:48:56,655 --> 00:48:58,172
it doesn't align with my game.

1129
00:48:58,275 --> 00:48:59,896
But what
they really want is Jake.

1130
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,137
-We want Kendra.
-Yeah.

1131
00:49:02,241 --> 00:49:03,482
I don't know about Kendra.

1132
00:49:03,586 --> 00:49:06,896
So, Dee's got
her own personal agenda

1133
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,413
and I've got mine,

1134
00:49:08,517 --> 00:49:10,931
and I don't know how
that's gonna play out yet.

1135
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:18,379
-So, yeah, we... like...
-Okay, yeah.

1136
00:49:19,448 --> 00:49:20,862
Yeah.

1137
00:49:20,965 --> 00:49:23,827
The plan is still Jake,
as far as I know, but

1138
00:49:23,931 --> 00:49:26,310
it seems easier
than it should be.

1139
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:32,551
I think they're gonna...

1140
00:49:36,517 --> 00:49:38,586
-And then throw my name.
-Okay.

1141
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:40,931
KENDRA:
And I'm having an extremely
hard time with that

1142
00:49:41,034 --> 00:49:42,827
because last night seemed easier
than it should be,

1143
00:49:42,931 --> 00:49:44,586
and I got blindsided.

1144
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:45,896
-How are you doing?
-I'm doing okay.

1145
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,379
-Um...
-Yeah.

1146
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:50,551
Me, Mama and Bruce
decided on Jake...

1147
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,793
-Okay, awesome.
-when we were eating together.

1148
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:54,241
Thank you for letting...
Oh, okay.

1149
00:49:54,344 --> 00:49:55,827
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Thank you for letting me know.

1150
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:57,586
-Yeah.
-But I think you're right.

1151
00:49:57,689 --> 00:49:59,000
I think
it has to be Jake tonight.

1152
00:49:59,103 --> 00:50:00,586
-Me too.
-So, yeah.

1153
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:03,068
There's no other option.
Sorry, Jake.

1154
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:06,896
KENDRA:
But Emily reassures me
she feels the same way,

1155
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,517
and that's where the vote
is going tonight, so...

1156
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,689
Okay, I just need
to not be paranoid.

1157
00:50:14,206 --> 00:50:16,275
Sound like everybody's
doing Jake.

1158
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:17,724
Wait, really? I thought
we wanted to do Kendra?

1159
00:50:17,827 --> 00:50:19,758
-Really?
-Yes.

1160
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:21,310
That's the first
I'm hearing about it.

1161
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:24,000
But why Kendra?
She's 100% a vote for us.

1162
00:50:25,413 --> 00:50:28,344
Yeah. Talk to me
about how you came

1163
00:50:28,448 --> 00:50:31,689
-to the Kendra conclusion
and with whom.
-Uh...

1164
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,965
Okay.

1165
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:37,551
EMILY:
The old Reba now is
potentially throwing out

1166
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:39,172
Kendra's name as somebody

1167
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:40,517
who they think
that they can't trust.

1168
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,758
I hate hearing

1169
00:50:41,862 --> 00:50:43,103
Kendra's name.
I understand

1170
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,448
that she can be
a little bit of a wild card,

1171
00:50:45,551 --> 00:50:48,517
but there are so many other
people that are, in my opinion,

1172
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,413
bigger threats, less likely
to work with me in this game.

1173
00:50:51,517 --> 00:50:54,448
I think Jake is more loyal
to Bruce than Kendra is.

1174
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,965
Jake doesn't have
his Shot in the Dark.

1175
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:57,413
We all tried
to send him home earlier.

1176
00:50:57,517 --> 00:50:59,517
Easy, in and out.

1177
00:51:02,551 --> 00:51:03,931
Yeah.

1178
00:51:05,413 --> 00:51:06,758
I feel totally powerless

1179
00:51:06,862 --> 00:51:09,000
because I have no vote
to offer, which is

1180
00:51:09,103 --> 00:51:11,448
kind of scary when you're not
the one in control.

1181
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:12,965
In the game of Survivor,
you always want

1182
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:14,586
to be the one
making the decisions.

1183
00:51:14,689 --> 00:51:17,206
This is suddenly seeming more
complicated than it needs to be.

1184
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,137
-Really?
-But... Yeah, a little bit.

1185
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:22,103
I'm in a little bit of
a compromised situation because

1186
00:51:22,206 --> 00:51:23,413
I have my alliance with Emily,

1187
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:24,827
and Emily wants Jake
out of here.

1188
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:26,724
Help me.

1189
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,103
Yeah. I... I want to...

1190
00:51:30,206 --> 00:51:32,000
-We haven't had a catch-up.
All right.
-Yeah.

1191
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,275
I could change the vote to Jake.
Jake is erratic.

1192
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:38,724
He's a sunken ship. He's got
a hole in his broadside.

1193
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:40,034
And you feel bad for the guy,

1194
00:51:40,137 --> 00:51:41,413
but nobody wants
to go and help him.

1195
00:51:43,206 --> 00:51:44,862
DREW:
I know Austin
would be willing to do it,

1196
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:46,965
and Julie, of course,
would happily agree.

1197
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:49,586
I think that everyone else
is gonna pile on Jake.

1198
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,310
Hmm.

1199
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,758
I'm not 100.

1200
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,206
I already know

1201
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,689
everybody wants Jake out,

1202
00:51:57,793 --> 00:52:00,172
which seems like
such an easy vote.

1203
00:52:02,379 --> 00:52:03,620
But I don't want that.

1204
00:52:03,724 --> 00:52:05,034
She's trying to get me out.

1205
00:52:05,137 --> 00:52:07,137
I need to do
what's best for my game,

1206
00:52:07,241 --> 00:52:09,310
and right now
I want Kendra out

1207
00:52:09,413 --> 00:52:12,000

every single Tribal Council,

and I've seen
some amazing blindsides,

but I'm pretty sure

1230
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:46,379
last Tribal's
blindside of Kellie

1231
00:53:46,482 --> 00:53:47,896
will go down on a lot of lists

1232
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,310
as one of the most devastating
and surprising.

1233
00:53:51,413 --> 00:53:53,137
Kendra, you were

1234
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:56,137
-visibly upset.
-KENDRA: Yeah. That's something

1235
00:53:56,241 --> 00:53:57,965
I did not expect
coming into this game.

1236
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,034
Like, I am emotional person,
I wear my heart on my sleeve,

1237
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:01,517
but it is a game.

1238
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,137
And just looking
at my first friend...

1239
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,724
Literally, Kellie is

1240
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,620
my first friend here
on Survivor,like, literally.

1241
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:13,413
And that was so much harder

1242
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,655
than I ever expected it to feel.

1243
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:18,517
PROBST:
And Dee, was there
also the feeling

1244
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:22,137
that, "Wow, the game is on.
Because if that happened

1245
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:25,000
-to Kellie,
it could be me next time"?
-DEE: Yeah.

1246
00:54:25,103 --> 00:54:26,482
You come into this game,
and everyone wants

1247
00:54:26,586 --> 00:54:28,448
to make a big move,
everyone wants to do blindside

1248
00:54:28,551 --> 00:54:30,206
and you're watching it on TV
and it's super cool.

1249
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,862
But when you're out here,
we're not robots.

1250
00:54:32,965 --> 00:54:35,034
Like, we're playing with humans
and their feelings.

1251
00:54:35,137 --> 00:54:36,931
It's tough.
It's a lot tougher here

1252
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:39,000
than what you see on TV,
and I don't think

1253
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,586
anyone will ever understand that

1254
00:54:40,689 --> 00:54:42,620
unless you're playing Survivor.

1255
00:54:42,724 --> 00:54:44,655
PROBST:
Jake, how about for you?

1256
00:54:44,758 --> 00:54:46,931
What was that feeling
when you saw

1257
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:50,068
your name come up,
come up, come up, and then

1258
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:51,517
you saw Kellie's name?

1259
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,103
What was happening emotionally?

1260
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,172
Honestly, I was prepared
to see my name,

1261
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:58,862
so I kind of already mentally
steeled myself to see it.

1262
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:03,034
But when I saw Kellie's name
come up, I was floored.

1263
00:55:03,137 --> 00:55:05,103
There-there was relief,
but it was also like,

1264
00:55:05,206 --> 00:55:07,137
that's not a spot
that you want to be in.

1265
00:55:07,241 --> 00:55:09,137
Obviously,
I'm at the bottom, Jeff.

1266
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:12,275
So, does a blindside
of that magnitude

1267
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:15,379
shift the game simply because
it is like an earthquake,

1268
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,827
-JAKE: Yeah.
-and now the earth
is not the same out here?

1269
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:20,655
I'm-I'm hoping that
it did shift the game because

1270
00:55:20,758 --> 00:55:23,103
I'm trying to catch up
as fast as I can,

1271
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:24,793
you know, because
I made a lot of mistakes.

1272
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:26,965
Fortunately, I didn't get
voted out last night,

1273
00:55:27,068 --> 00:55:29,448
so I do have the opportunity
to correct those mistakes,

1274
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:31,103
and hopefully

1275
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:33,689
make it beyond this Tribal
right here tonight, Jeff.

1276
00:55:33,793 --> 00:55:35,758
PROBST:
All right, let's get into

1277
00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:38,310
today's events.
A lot went down.

1278
00:55:38,413 --> 00:55:41,655
It was a three-stage challenge,
but once again, we had

1279
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:44,344
another battle
between Bruce and Julie,

1280
00:55:44,448 --> 00:55:47,103
two of the older players
in the game.

1281
00:55:47,206 --> 00:55:49,620
They have dominated
the last two challenges.

1282
00:55:49,724 --> 00:55:51,931
So, Julie, I realize it would
feel better if you had won,

1283
00:55:52,034 --> 00:55:55,758
but it was
very competitive again.

1284
00:55:55,862 --> 00:55:58,275
So, I hope
I've made my kids proud.

1285
00:55:58,379 --> 00:56:00,379
-You have.
-That's my number one.

1286
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,620
But other than that, I forget

1287
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:04,517
that I'm not one
of these young'uns,

1288
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,517
and so, I'm kind of like,
"All right,

1289
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,448
I'm doing great
and I'm the oldest."

1290
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:10,724
So there is that, and yes...

1291
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:12,896
[groans] Yeah, it would
be better if I'd beaten him.

1292
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,586
That... [groans]

1293
00:56:15,689 --> 00:56:17,103
PROBST:
Bruce, how about for you?
Back-to-back wins

1294
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:21,586
in any season for any player
is a big deal.

1295
00:56:21,689 --> 00:56:23,793
Not a good thing,
but it's a big deal.

1296
00:56:23,896 --> 00:56:26,827
Wait, wait.
Let's examine that answer.

1297
00:56:26,931 --> 00:56:28,206
[laughing]

1298
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:29,793
PROBST:
"Not a good thing."

1299
00:56:29,896 --> 00:56:32,000
Why don't you solve that dilemma

1300
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:34,344
by taking that necklace off
and putting it on someone else

1301
00:56:34,448 --> 00:56:36,206
-and burden them with it?
-JULIE: I'll take it.

1302
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:40,275
Why are you speaking
blasphemy right now? No, no, no.

1303
00:56:40,379 --> 00:56:43,482
Um, I-I say that because
it's one of those things.

1304
00:56:43,586 --> 00:56:46,482
You know, you want to be able to
protect yourself in this game.

1305
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:48,068
Like, immunity is huge,

1306
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:50,620
but it paints, also,

1307
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:52,137
a big target on your back.

1308
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:54,758
I want to hear them
cheering for me. I do. Like,

1309
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:56,965
"Go ahead, Bruce! You can
do it!" You know, like, "Yay!"

1310
00:56:57,068 --> 00:56:59,206
But no.
People are gonna be like,

1311
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,724
"Damn it, dude, just pass out

1312
00:57:01,827 --> 00:57:03,000
"so somebody else could win.

1313
00:57:03,103 --> 00:57:04,310
Just get the hell
out of the way."

1314
00:57:04,413 --> 00:57:06,068
Drew, it is a tricky thing.

1315
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,275
When you win, you're safe,

1316
00:57:08,379 --> 00:57:11,068
but you show everybody else,
"I could win again."

1317
00:57:11,172 --> 00:57:14,758
Yeah, absolutely. And, you know,
to Bruce's credit,

1318
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:16,344
people don't just see
the two immunity wins.

1319
00:57:16,448 --> 00:57:19,689
People see the hours of hard
work and practice and training

1320
00:57:19,793 --> 00:57:21,758
that is both
physical and mental.

1321
00:57:21,862 --> 00:57:24,206
But with the necklace, it's like
a sword of Damocles situation

1322
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,517
where there is the reminder
that eventually,

1323
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,310
there will be a moment where
you don't have the necklace.

1324
00:57:28,413 --> 00:57:30,344
And all of those wins

1325
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:33,758
will build up
into a bigger and bigger target.

1326
00:57:35,068 --> 00:57:37,931
Okay, there was
one more twist today,

1327
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:39,965
which was the first
group of three

1328
00:57:40,068 --> 00:57:42,965
that finished last
lost their vote

1329
00:57:43,068 --> 00:57:44,965
and had to go

1330
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:47,689
on a journey
to try to earn their vote back.

1331
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:49,827
So, Drew, three people

1332
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:51,758
lose their vote.
That we know.

1333
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:53,310
Then three people
go on a journey

1334
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:55,655
and come back and say
they didn't get their vote back.

1335
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:58,275
-That we don't know.
-DREW: We don't.

1336
00:57:58,379 --> 00:58:00,793
Typically, when you go
into a Tribal Council, you know

1337
00:58:00,896 --> 00:58:02,000
how many votes they're gonna be.

1338
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,448
This twist adds a complication

1339
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:04,862
where, suddenly,

1340
00:58:04,965 --> 00:58:06,931
it's not clear if you're voting
with six people,

1341
00:58:07,034 --> 00:58:08,620
seven people, eight people,
nine people.

1342
00:58:08,724 --> 00:58:11,517
And that's really scary because

1343
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,724
it throws off any possible
voting calculation from

1344
00:58:14,827 --> 00:58:16,517
a strategic standpoint,
and you have to default instead

1345
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,517
to your relationships
with these people

1346
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,482
-in hopes
that they're being honest.
-PROBST: Kendra,

1347
00:58:20,586 --> 00:58:23,000
what's your reaction to that?
Because you seem to have one.

1348
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:26,413
Honestly, my reaction
is right now is

1349
00:58:26,517 --> 00:58:29,931
did y'all really
lose your votes, or...

1350
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,034
-No.
-Okay. Sorry. I was...

1351
00:58:34,137 --> 00:58:36,206
With what Drew was saying,
it was like, "Wait,

1352
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,413
did three people
lose their votes, or..."

1353
00:58:38,517 --> 00:58:41,206
Well, I mean, that's just
the strategic implication,

1354
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:42,793
-the twist, you know.
-I didn't even think about that.

1355
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:44,241
-Anyways...
-PROBST: Wait, wait. Kendra,

1356
00:58:44,344 --> 00:58:47,000
You didn't think
about the fact that what?

1357
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:49,931
So-Somebody could be lying.
[laughs]

1358
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:52,482
You know, Jeff,

1359
00:58:52,586 --> 00:58:55,517
I ate my first chicken today
for the first time in 15 years.

1360
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,103
I think my mind's working
a little differently

1361
00:58:57,206 --> 00:58:58,448
and, I don't know,

1362
00:58:58,551 --> 00:59:00,482
it got a little bit
of meat sweats today.

1363
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:04,206
PROBST:
Dee, it sounds like
these missing votes

1364
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:07,034
-are going to play
a big part tonight.
-DEE: Yeah, Jeff.

1365
00:59:07,137 --> 00:59:08,689
We're at a point in the game
where, like,

1366
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:11,724
things cross your mind, and then
you don't know if it's paranoia,

1367
00:59:11,827 --> 00:59:13,379
but you don't know
if it's the truth.

1368
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:16,137
And as players, I feel like
we're evolving. Like, you know,

1369
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:19,068
as a Pokémon, you evolve
into, like, Charizard.

1370
00:59:19,172 --> 00:59:20,655
I feel like that's
what the new era is.

1371
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:22,655
It's like an evolution.
And now with three less votes--

1372
00:59:22,758 --> 00:59:24,586
if they did lose their votes--
players are more strategic,

1373
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:27,620
and they are thinking
a little bit more,

1374
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:29,172
like, evil-ish, you know?

1375
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:33,275
PROBST:
Kendra, if these
three votes are gone,

1376
00:59:33,379 --> 00:59:36,068
does it help your game tonight
or hurt it?

1377
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,310
KENDRA:
It's really hard to say, Jeff.

1378
00:59:38,413 --> 00:59:39,482
Last night was a big...

1379
00:59:39,586 --> 00:59:41,275
Like, the curtains
are wide open.

1380
00:59:41,379 --> 00:59:42,482
The show is on.

1381
00:59:42,586 --> 00:59:44,379
Like, we are moving on
to act two.

1382
00:59:44,482 --> 00:59:47,137
And so, I am not sure

1383
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:50,103
I was included
on these, like, bigger-picture

1384
00:59:50,206 --> 00:59:52,758
conversations
that could be happening.

Jake, does the potential loss
of three votes

1386
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:57,068
help you or hurt you?

1387
00:59:57,172 --> 01:00:00,931
Um, I think it helps me more
than hurts me,

1388
01:00:01,034 --> 01:00:03,068
but the game is changing,
and I'm behind.

1389
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:05,137
I need to catch up right now.

1390
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:06,689
I need some friends out here.
I mean,

1391
01:00:06,793 --> 01:00:09,137
I'm trying to, like,
build relationships with, like,

1392
01:00:09,241 --> 01:00:10,517
different people and, like,

1393
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,413
let them know that
I'm a free agent out here.

1394
01:00:12,517 --> 01:00:14,448
You can use me.

1395
01:00:14,551 --> 01:00:16,896
I'm looking for a home.
Let me in.
