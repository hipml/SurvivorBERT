1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Previously on Survivor.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:13,960
At the Millennial Tribe, Viggy and Taylor couldn't hide their love.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:22,040
At the Gen X Tribe, a blindsided Brett and Chris sought revenge on Jessica.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,240
But David and Ken wanted to save her.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,560
It's your one aim going down.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,760
My mom says they're gunning for me, but it seems a little suspicious.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,040
At Tribal Council, David played his idol for Jessica.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,240
This is a hidden immunity idol.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,720
Saving her and sending Lucy home.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,400
Lucy, the tribe has spoken.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Sixteen are left.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Who will be voted out tonight?

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:01:11,680
Y'all can let me have it now or not, it's up to you.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
I'm not mad at you, David.

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
I'm not mad at you.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
I ain't either.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,200
I'm just curious why I like the dramatics.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,640
I played an idol tonight, but I don't know that playing that idol was the right move

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,120
because I saved someone who nobody really wants to work with.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,320
And now I don't have an idol and I'm incredibly vulnerable.

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,680
I owe Dave and you so much and I'm sorry I didn't listen.

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
I shouldn't have.

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,560
Can I tell you something I haven't told anybody?

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,400
I found a legacy advantage.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,000
So if I'm still here on day 36, I will receive an advantage in the game.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,680
If I had been voted out, I would have handed it to you because you were trying to help

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,840
me.

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,440
I told Ken about the legacy advantage because I wanted him to know that he can trust me.

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,720
So I'm hoping that that bought me some more goodwill.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,720
I'm really, I'm so sorry.

31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
I'm so sorry.

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Don't worry about it.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
No, I am.

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
Don't worry about it.

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,280
Jess says that she has a legacy and she's going to share it with me.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
That means a lot.

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
I'm giving Jess my full trust again.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,160
This game just messes with you so much.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
You have those.

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,160
We're going to look everywhere.

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,360
Ain't no shame today.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,200
Am I right, CeCe?

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
What?

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Ain't no shame in looking for the idol today.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Ain't no shame in looking for the idol.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I'm telling you, man.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,320
Since the immunity was flagged, the immunity idol is back up for grabs.

48
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:11,600
So we kind of like had an idol search party.

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,760
It's an interesting little area over here.

50
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
It is.

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,200
We openly were on the hunt for a hidden immunity idol.

52
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,840
I felt empowered by the fact that I was the only one that knew to look for a symbol of

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,360
our tribe.

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,920
But the one issue with an open idol hunt is that everybody is looking for the idol and

55
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,360
you might be seen having found it.

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
So frustrating.

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,560
Keep looking, Sunday.

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,720
So I'm wandering the jungle and then I just turn and I spot on the ground a log with our

59
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,680
tribe symbol on it.

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,040
Right nearby was Sunday and CeCe.

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,520
And I'm thinking, oh, this is the worst.

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
This is the worst.

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
A log.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
You know what, you?

65
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
No.

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Oh my God.

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
This is exhausting.

68
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Eventually CeCe gets bored.

69
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
She goes back to camp.

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
So does Sunday.

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Oh, yes.

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Yep.

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
That's the sound of an idol inside.

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
All right.

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
I know you're in there.

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:19,240
Immunity Isle.

77
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:25,960
I found the other one.

78
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,240
Oh my God.

79
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,960
I can't believe that I was so fortunate to play an idol and then find it again the very

80
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
next day.

81
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Congratulations.

82
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
You found the Hidden Immunity Isle.

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,080
The Hidden Immunity Isle will keep you safe from being voted off of tribal council.

84
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
To be able to do what I love and crave.

85
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,760
I've tasted no victory in my real life that compares to the victory that I feel right

86
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,120
now in Survivor.

87
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,480
It's just a shame that it took me till 42 years of age to get it.

88
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,520
But I want to be that guy because that's going to get me further in this game.

89
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Here I go, guys.

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Millennials, get in your face.

91
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
You're doing it.

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
I'm doing it.

93
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
I'm doing it.

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
I'm doing it.

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
I'm doing it.

96
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
I'm doing it.

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
I'm doing it.

98
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm doing it.

99
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
I'm doing it.

100
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
I'm doing it.

101
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
I'm doing it.

102
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
I'm doing it.

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
I'm doing it.

104
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,320
get in your first look at the new Gen X tribe.

105
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,160
Lucy voted out at the last tribal council.

106
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,160
All right, shall we get to it?

107
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,200
Yes.

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,560
Well, there are so many elements to the game of Survivor.

109
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Knots and puzzles you can practice in your backyard.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
You can go to therapy, learn how to get along with people better.

111
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,240
But there are some elements that you have absolutely no control over,

112
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,880
and yet they can change your game just like that.

113
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,560
Everybody, drop your buffs.

114
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,560
We're switching things up.

115
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,840
Everybody, drop your buffs.

116
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,040
We're switching things up.

117
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,240
To be a little more interesting,

118
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,280
not only going to mix up the tribes,

119
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,280
we're going to switch from two tribes to three tribes.

120
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,680
Oh, my God!

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,400
Expansion.

122
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
If you draw an orange buff,

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,040
you will return to what was the Millennial Beach.

124
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,960
Your new tribe name will be Vanua.

125
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,160
If you draw a purple buff,

126
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,760
you'll return to what was Gen X.

127
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,240
Your new tribe name is Tikali.

128
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,920
If you draw a green buff,

129
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,240
you will go to a new beach.

130
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,800
Your tribe name will be Icabula,

131
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,320
and you will have to start from scratch.

132
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,160
Oh, my God.

133
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Oh, my God.

134
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,520
To help offset that work,

135
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,560
you will have one extra tribe member.

136
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
All right, shall we see what's going to happen?

137
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,880
Yeah. Let's do it.

138
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,280
Let's do it.

139
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Get this over with.

140
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,080
Oh, and oh, and oh, and.

141
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,640
Don't open them yet.

142
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,520
Oh, my God.

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,440
The swap is random.

144
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,520
You have no idea what's going to happen,

145
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
especially, like, me and Figs

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,760
with this, like, little romance going on.

147
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Iggy grabs.

148
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,520
My biggest fear right now is getting split up.

149
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
Give me something good, Jeff.

150
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
Moment of truth, baby.

151
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Oh.

152
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,920
Let's do it. Everybody reveal.

153
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Oh, my God.

154
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,960
If you're green, you go in the middle,

155
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
where there is no map.

156
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,920
Hold them up once you get it.

157
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,560
Put them on. Damn it.

158
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,680
Mikayla, green and not happy.

159
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm purple.

160
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,080
Is that good? Purple, purple.

161
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,960
Brett is green.

162
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Jay is green.

163
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Hi. Hi, I'm Hannah.

164
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Boy, Mikayla is wearing it on her face.

165
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Hi, Hannah. Nice to meet you.

166
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Hey, guys.

167
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Give her a hug, buddy.

168
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Hugs are good.

169
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Nice to meet you.

170
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
All right, let's take a look at our new tribes.

171
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,560
To Kali, we have three millennials,

172
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
Taylor, Figgy, and Adam,

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
along with two Gen Xers,

174
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Jessica and Ken.

175
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Figgy, you're smiling big.

176
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
I'm just pumped up, man.

177
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Honestly, like, I see success from here.

178
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Rock on.

179
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Big tales continue.

180
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Like, I was so stoked

181
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
because I've got the numbers and I have Fig,

182
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,960
so it could not go any better for me.

183
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,960
The newa, we have three Gen Xers,

184
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Cece, Chris, and Dave,

185
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,960
and two millennials, Zeke and Michelle.

186
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Zeke, you were on the majority tribe.

187
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,960
With a winning streak, you're now in the minority

188
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,960
on a tribe of only five, not many places to hide.

189
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Yeah, it's tricky.

190
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
The numbers are definitely not in my favor.

191
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
But, you know, I look around,

192
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
I see a strong tribe, I see a tribe

193
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
that I think can continue the winning streak.

194
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
And for Iqabula,

195
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
we have four millennials,

196
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Makayla, Hannah, Jay, and Will,

197
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,960
and two Gen Xers, Sunday and Brett.

198
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Makayla, you still seem unhappy right now.

199
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
You didn't do this right, Jeff. Just saying.

200
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,960
All right, fair enough. I'll take it.

201
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,960
I open up my buff and I see green.

202
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Man, I was pissed.

203
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,960
You gonna send us to an empty beach

204
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
where we gotta make the shelter

205
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
and we don't have any food.

206
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I just wanted to flick them off right there,

207
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
but I didn't.

208
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Iqabula, map to your home.

209
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Good luck building that shelter.

210
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Thanks.

211
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
All right, head out.

212
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Get to know your new tribes.

213
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
This was like the disaster scenario.

214
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
I'm on the one tribe where the millennials

215
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,960
are not in the numbers, and I'm with Michelle,

216
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,960
the one person from my tribe I have zero trust in.

217
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,960
And we're outnumbered, so we're in a bad spot.

218
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,960
MUSIC

219
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Do you guys want an introduction?

220
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Oh, yeah, let's do it.

221
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Brett. Jay. Jay.

222
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Will. Will.

223
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Makayla. Makayla.

224
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Sunday. Sunday and I are in serious trouble right now.

225
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
But Gen Xers, we have the drive to get through

226
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,960
tough times in life and not to quit.

227
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
All right, so we hit the well,

228
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
and then we'll get to the shelter.

229
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Yeah.

230
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,960
So I need to prove to them that I'm worth keeping around,

231
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,960
because right now it's just all about surviving this game.

232
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Let's do it.

233
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,960
MUSIC

234
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
On the millennial side of things,

235
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
everyone says we're just dreamers.

236
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,960
But the truth is, most of us are relentless.

237
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,960
So do you want to make indentation in that one?

238
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
You know what I'm saying? So it could sit on it?

239
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I have no idea what you're saying.

240
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Kind of like this?

241
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
The Gen Xers said, oh, we work hard,

242
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
and we do things the right way.

243
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
But the people that I have right now,

244
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I got Brett and Sunday.

245
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
And it just sucks because they can't figure things out

246
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
for themselves, and they just sit back

247
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
and wait for you to say something.

248
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
We're going to put two like this.

249
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,960
OK. Kid knows how to do everything, huh?

250
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Oh, that's cool, huh?

251
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
But even if I got to build a new shelter,

252
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm happy, because we have the numbers.

253
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Four millennials, two Gen Xers.

254
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
See you later, Gen Xers, because I'm chilling

255
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
even if I lose a challenge.

256
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
I don't care.

257
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Boom, you're out of here.

258
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
This is now your home.

259
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Yay!

260
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Well done. Super cool.

261
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
So different than ours.

262
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
You guys want a tour?

263
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Yeah.

264
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Let's do it, man.

265
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Coming back to camp was interesting.

266
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
The millennials definitely bring some high energy,

267
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
some goofy energy to the tribe.

268
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Do you guys have a goat looser?

269
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
No.

270
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
We have a goat that's loose.

271
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
If I catch that thing, it is dead.

272
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
If you guys want a song...

273
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Hopefully, Jess and I being more grounded

274
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,960
and more subtle with the way that we speak

275
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
and the way we do things can help us.

276
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Oh, I'm so happy.

277
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
This is awesome.

278
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
You should not hug me.

279
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
So are we doing that?

280
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Yeah.

281
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Even though we have numbers?

282
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Screw that.

284
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
It sucks, Vic.

285
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
You said no.

286
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Oh, yeah.

287
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
I said no.

288
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
No contact.

289
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Taylor thinks because we have the numbers

290
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
that we can be out in the open.

291
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
No.

292
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Sorry, Taylor.

293
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
I love you to pieces,

294
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
but being with these new people,

295
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
that's gonna put a target on our back,

296
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
so it's not smart.

297
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Does it really matter, though?

298
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Yeah.

299
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Like, that matters?

300
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Yeah.

301
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Fine.

302
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Trust me.

303
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I trust you.

304
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I just think it's stupid.

305
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Get over it.

306
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,960
But you know you're gonna do what she says.

307
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I know.

308
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Vic doesn't want anything to do with me.

309
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,960
She's like, stay away from me, stay away from me.

310
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
But I really think that us being a power couple

311
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,960
isn't any different than two people in an alliance

312
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
that really trust each other.

313
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,960
We'll do taro, eggplant, pepper, stir fry with some fish.

314
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
That's perfect.

315
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
I love it.

316
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I was thinking boiling these separate,

317
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
just to soften them,

318
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
and then I'll stir fry the rest.

319
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Sounds great to me.

320
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Getting swapped into a tribe with only Taylor and Figgy

321
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
from my original millennial tribe,

322
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
it's my worst nightmare.

323
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Figgy is very controlling.

324
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,960
She lies constantly,

325
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,960
and she's gonna go through this charade as long as she can

326
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
about how they are not a couple.

327
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
I don't know how long that will last,

328
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
but I think it's gonna be a great experience.

329
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
I think it's gonna be a great experience.

330
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
I think it's gonna be a great experience.

331
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
I think it's gonna be a great experience.

332
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,960
she decided that Gal way to be her friend

333
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,960
she decided that Gal way to be her friend

334
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
and today she and Fritz are not a couple.

335
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
and today she and Fritz are not a couple.

336
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
I don't know how long that will last

337
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,960
because Taylor is ready to start canoodling again.

338
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,960
To me, that's a worthless partnership.

339
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,960
How did you feel over there?

340
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Should feel like you were towards the top,

341
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
towards the bottom?

342
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Right around down here.

343
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
But I'm third?

344
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
But I'm third?

345
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,460
Was your name also up there?

346
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,960
No, but Figgies was.

347
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
And that was you?

348
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Yeah.

349
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,460
Were you the only one that put Figgies' name down?

350
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,460
No, me and Mari and Zeke.

351
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,960
Adam's just like the nicest kid ever.

352
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,460
Kind of feel like I hit the jackpot.

353
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,960
He's super positive, he's respectful, he's polite,

354
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
and there's a little bit of a crack in the Millennials.

355
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
So hopefully Jess and I have got Adam.

356
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I got your back, man. I think you seem cool.

357
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Shake off all the dust.

358
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Yep, yep.

359
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Shake it off. It sucks.

360
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Thanks, man.

361
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,460
Ken and Jessica, they seem to have a tight bond,

362
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,960
and I know that Figgie and Taylor won't turn on each other,

363
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,960
so I have pairs on both sides of me.

364
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,460
I'm the guy they need to come to,

365
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm the guy they need to work with.

366
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:59,960
I get to decide which side moves forward.

367
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Did you dream, Mr. Daisy?

368
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,960
I don't dream. I have no dreams.

369
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Yeah, I very, very rarely remember a dream.

370
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I mostly just sort of wake up and...

371
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Good morning, Michelle.

372
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Good morning.

373
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Good morning.

374
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Yeah, I'm going to go do your dream.

375
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,460
What about you, Dave? Did you dream?

376
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,960
This is the first time I think I had a dream since I got here.

377
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Yeah, wow.

378
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
So you actually slept.

379
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Yeah, exactly.

380
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
How'd you sleep?

381
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Not too good.

382
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Good, all right.

383
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,960
My whole game was turned upside down.

384
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,960
I happened to be on the only tribe with the minority Millennials,

385
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,960
just me and Zeke, and three Gen Xers.

386
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Are you guys thinking we should slow cook the beans?

387
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm not that hungry.

388
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
I'm a little worried if we have a challenge

389
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
that we won't have time to cook the beans.

390
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
That's true, that's a good thing.

391
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,960
My problem is that the Alliance might be stacked against me,

392
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
so I'm definitely scared.

393
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
You got it, Dave.

394
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Oh, yeah.

395
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm mixed. Where y'all are from?

396
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Oklahoma.

397
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Oklahoma?

398
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
I'm from Edmond.

399
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
I grew up here at 12 Springs Falls.

400
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
We're the Oakey Boys, man.

401
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
He's a Sooner Nation, too.

402
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Okay.

403
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Pennsylvania now, Ellen.

404
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Okay.

405
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Did you play for the Sooners?

406
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Yeah.

407
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Who did you coach to play for?

408
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Two years of Blake, two years of Stu.

409
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Oh, so you were on the National Championships.

410
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Yeah.

411
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
I see you didn't bring your ring out.

412
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
No, no ring out here.

413
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Right, you can't lose a National Championship ring.

414
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

415
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Oh, wow.

416
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Yeah, that was a good year.

417
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Zeke's an Oklahoma boy, just like me.

418
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Grew up in Oklahoma, probably an hour and a half from where I grew up.

419
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,960
He's a big Sooner fan, and of course I played on the last National Championship,

420
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
so we have that connection immediately.

421
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
I'm all broken down.

422
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
It hurts, man.

423
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Oh, that cotton ball.

424
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
You ready?

425
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
You ready?

426
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I am feeling better on this new tribe than I did at the end of the Gen X,

427
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,960
because here I feel like I have a tad bit more control over my decisions

428
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
and how I'm going to play the game.

429
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Hey, I want you to know right up front, y'all got a chance,

430
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,960
because I mean you need to talk before anything,

431
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,960
just because there's three of us doesn't mean anything.

432
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Don't think you're just out, because I'm ready to make a move.

433
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Chris played for my team, the University of Oklahoma Sooners.

434
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Not only did he play for the Sooners, he was on the 2000 National Championship team.

435
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,960
These guys were my childhood heroes.

436
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,960
That National Championship was one of the biggest events of my childhood.

437
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,960
I got a game plan, and we can hash it out together and see what you think,

438
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
because right now I guarantee those two will want to just,

439
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,960
don't just want to hold you on out, and I got different plans.

440
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Alright, who do I want to work with?

441
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I want to work with the big ginger-haired football player,

442
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,960
who says, buddy, don't worry, things are not what they seem.

443
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,960
You are not on the bottom, and I want to work with you.

444
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,960
It's like the heavens open and the lights shine down,

445
00:17:48,960 --> 00:18:09,960
and finally I catch a break in this game.

446
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
So we wake up this morning.

447
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,960
We don't have a fire yet, and I'm starving and I'm thirsty.

448
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
There you go.

449
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Why doesn't that light, man?

450
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
I don't know. I don't understand.

451
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,960
I'm trying to use this flamethrower. I'm exhausted. I'm trying. I'm trying.

452
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,960
It just does not work for me, and I don't understand why,

453
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,960
and I'm just losing all hope, and I'm like, you know what, forget this.

454
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
How about it?

455
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
The fire got to a point where Jay gave up.

456
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,960
I was exhausted, but I was like, fire is necessary to our life in the game.

457
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,960
So I started trying deeper down.

458
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
There is this theme in my life that sometimes I get to a point

459
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,960
where I've given it all that I have, and I'm almost to the point of giving up,

460
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
and then I push a little further, and things pop.

461
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,960
I worked for things, working to put my own self through college,

462
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,960
working to pay off my own loans. I worked.

463
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Good spot.

464
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,960
There it is.

465
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,960
There it is. Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

466
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Keep it going.

467
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Oh, it works. Come on.

468
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Michaela said, well, let me try, and she went berserk,

469
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
and all these sparks got coming out.

470
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Next thing you know, boom, the whole thing ignited in the fire.

471
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
We were psyched, and I was psyched for her.

472
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
There you go. Keep it going.

473
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Michaela, awesome.

474
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Man, it really brought us all back to life, and it was a great moment,

475
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:52,960
because she saved us today, and it was really kind of emotional for her.

476
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,960
I'm normally not a person to cry, but sometimes you just need something so bad.

477
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Sometimes when you have no other choice but to get something done, it happens.

478
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,960
It's just letting me know the life I'm trying to get by winning this thing is worth it.

479
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,960
I do want it badly for my family.

480
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,960
There's nobody in my family that's been able to have success and keep it.

481
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
It's like everybody has some type of problem,

482
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,960
and I just want to prove that you can have success, and you can have your family together.

483
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Michaela, you're a hero.

484
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,960
You are the best. Look at that.

485
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Is that awesome or what?

486
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Are you crying?

487
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,960
Yeah, you should be crying, because you just saved us.

488
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
You're not a girl.

489
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,960
You should be proud. None of us could do that, and you got it done.

490
00:20:44,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Michaela, my god, save the day.

491
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,960
All right, you guys ready to get to your first immunity challenge as new tribes?

492
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Yeah.

493
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,960
First things first, Zeke, need it back.

494
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Yep.

495
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Wow, nice toss.

496
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs, and today, two tribes will win immunity.

497
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Here's how it works for today's challenge.

498
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,960
You're going to dive down, retrieve a buoy, and swim it to the platform.

499
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Then the next person goes.

500
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Once you've collected all five buoys, you have a choice.

501
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,960
You can immediately start throwing your buoys, attempting to land them in the basket,

502
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:57,960
or you can take the time to try to hook your basket, pulling it much closer, making it easier to score.

503
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,960
First two tribes to five win immunity, safe from the vote, losers, tribal council,

504
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,960
or somebody will be the fifth person voted out of this game.

505
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,960
If you're a bully, you have one extra member.

506
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
We're going to sit somebody out.

507
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Who's it going to be?

508
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Will is going to sit this one out.

509
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Everybody else, get them in and strategize.

510
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,960
We'll get started.

511
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,960
All right, here we go for immunity.

512
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,960
First two tribes to finish, safe from tribal, losers, somebody will be voted out.

513
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Survivors ready?

514
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Go!

515
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Looking for that first buoy.

516
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Adam has it for Takali.

517
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Cece has hers for Vanua.

518
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Come on, Sunday.

519
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Sunday's still working on that buoy for Ikeboola.

520
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Cece is going to give up, and swimming in is going to cost her tribe a lot of time,

521
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,960
because somebody else will have to swim twice.

522
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,960
It is Adam and Cece in the lead.

523
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Adam is back with the first buoy.

524
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,960
All right, wait till it's in there.

525
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Go, Takali!

526
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Sunday is back.

527
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Go, Ikeboola!

528
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Jay in the water for Ikeboola.

529
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Jay making quick time of it.

530
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Cece still working for Vanua.

531
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Keep kicking.

532
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Jay is back.

533
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Go, Ikeboola!

534
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Jessica back with the second buoy.

535
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Go, Takali!

536
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Kayla quickly with the buoy.

537
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Come on, Cece, you got it.

538
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Cece is taking forever to get out of the water.

539
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Put it up there, Cece.

540
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Just put it up there and get up.

541
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Go!

542
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
David now in the water for Vanua.

543
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Viggy making good time.

544
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Good job, Viggy.

545
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Makayla now coming back.

546
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Go, Ikeboola!

547
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Go, Takali!

548
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,960
David has a buoy for Vanua.

549
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Now David's got to get out of the water.

550
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Ken with a buoy.

551
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Good job.

552
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Hannah has hers for Ikeboola.

553
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
Ken is back.

554
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
In the back, you're nice and easy.

555
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Go, Takali!

556
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
There we go.

557
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
David's struggling.

558
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,960
Come on, David, put it on the deck.

559
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
David cannot get out of the water with the buoy.

560
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
My God.

561
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
A huge setback for Vanua.

562
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Get it, David!

563
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Oh.

564
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
And now David loses the buoy.

565
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Come on, David.

566
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Oh my God.

567
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
He's got to get back in the water.

568
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
Disaster.

569
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
David, get it!

570
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Hannah back now.

571
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Go, Ikeboola!

572
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,960
Is he throwing this?

573
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Takali has all five.

574
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
You can start shooting.

575
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Ken now going to try to retrieve his basket and pull it closer.

576
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,960
David absolutely out of gas.

577
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,960
And he's lost the buoy again.

578
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Go!

579
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Fred is back.

580
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Ikeboola still has another buoy in the water.

581
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,960
Jay is going to have to swim all the way back, get up on the platform and go again.

582
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Ken going for it, but he's all knotted up.

583
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
We got it.

584
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
We got to leave.

585
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Come on, Jay.

586
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Come on, Jay, you got it.

587
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
That lead is evaporating.

588
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Jay, a monster in the water.

589
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Come on, Jay.

590
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Come on, Jay.

591
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Michelle trying to get a buoy.

592
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Go, go.

593
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,960
And she can't get a buoy.

594
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Jay is now back with the fifth buoy.

595
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Yes!

596
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Ken with a great lasso.

597
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
He's got it, pulling it closer.

598
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Mikaela now going to try to lasso that basket and pull it closer.

599
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
There you go.

600
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
No.

601
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Ken is now shooting.

602
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
Right there.

603
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Right there, Ken.

604
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,960
Chris is back with that third buoy.

605
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Go, Z!

606
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Zeke now in the water, slips off the platform.

607
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Takali has had to leave the entire challenge, but Ken has not yet scored.

608
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Woohoo!

609
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Ken in and out.

610
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Zeke is now back, but there's still one buoy short.

611
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Got to go all the way back, then come back and get the buoy.

612
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Can they make up the time they need to get in this?

613
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Come on, Mikaela.

614
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Ken misses again.

615
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
There you go.

616
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Mikaela hooks it for Ikebula.

617
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
She's pulling it closer.

618
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
We've got a challenge.

619
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Brett is in the water, Hannah in the water.

620
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,960
And Ken scores on her first shot.

621
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
It is now Ikebula in the lead.

622
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Two for two.

623
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Incredible.

624
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
In and out.

625
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
Got to get it back.

626
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,960
It is now Ikebula in the lead.

627
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Ken now scores for Takali.

628
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Way to go.

629
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Chris is back.

630
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Let's go.

631
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
What's the decision?

632
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Manua going to just start shooting.

633
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,960
There goes Chris from a long ways away.

634
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Can Chris find the distance?

635
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Yeah, Mikaela, take your time.

636
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Mikaela with the third for Ikebula.

637
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
There we go.

638
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,960
She has been on fire.

639
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Mikaela with four for Ikebula.

640
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
You got it.

641
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
You got it.

642
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
No, Chris short again.

643
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Don't get nervous.

644
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Just do it.

645
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Mikaela for the win.

646
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Mikaela for the win.

647
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Yes.

648
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Ikebula wins immunity.

649
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
We are looking for a second place.

650
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Watch out pulling in, Zeke.

651
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Michelle coming out of the water.

652
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Zeke coming out of the water.

653
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,960
They're going to go back to trying to lasso their target

654
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,960
and bring it closer after being dead last the entire challenge.

655
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Manua is still in it.

656
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,960
It is anybody's game right now for second.

657
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Ken with the second point for Takali.

658
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Okay.

659
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Come on, keep swimming.

660
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Just don't stop.

661
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Ken with the third for Takali.

662
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
He's got a hot streak now.

663
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Ken for four.

664
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
No.

665
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,960
It is a battle for the second immunity.

666
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Chris lassoes in for Manua.

667
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Their target is much closer.

668
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Will it make a difference?

669
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Frustration setting in for Manua.

670
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Takali has had a gigantic lead.

671
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Ken with the fourth.

672
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Ken needs one more to secure immunity for the win.

673
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Oh, yes.

674
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
There it is.

675
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Takali wins immunity.

676
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Manua sending Manua to tribal council.

677
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Ikebula, congratulations.

678
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Somebody swim over and get it.

679
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Nice job.

680
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,960
Thank you, sir.

681
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Takali sends somebody over to get it.

682
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,960
Nice entry.

683
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Thanks, sir.

684
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Nobody going home from Ikebula, nobody going home from Takali.

685
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,960
You will live to see another day in this game.

686
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Grab your stuff, swim on out, enjoy it.

687
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,960
Get him, boy.

688
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
All right, guys, date with me tonight.

689
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Tribal council, somebody from this five will be voted out.

690
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Swim it in, see you tonight at tribal.

691
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,960
I'm frustrated because CC and David are just atrocious in challenges,

692
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,960
and they don't even seem to care because they think they have the numbers.

693
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,960
But thankfully, Chris is trying to make a move with us.

694
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:38,960
And if he does, a Gen-Xer goes home regardless.

695
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
That sucked.

696
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
I think that sucked tonight, guys.

697
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
He swam twice, so you retired, too.

698
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,960
He swam twice.

699
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,960
I just blew it on the basketball, man.

700
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,960
I mean, I'm sorry about the buoy.

701
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,960
That just wasn't our best day.

702
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
We all tried.

703
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
We gave it our best shot.

704
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Yeah.

705
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,960
It was like a nightmare, a recurring nightmare.

706
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,960
It's like I go to sleep, I wake up, and I'm in this same nightmare,

707
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,960
back to tribal council.

708
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,960
The one positive is finally I'm not on the bottom.

709
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,960
This time we have the majority, three Gen-X against two Millennium,

710
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,960
so either Michelle or Zeke will be voted off.

711
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Zeke could do puzzles, and he's still strong.

712
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
He's still pretty decent in the water.

713
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Yeah.

714
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
No, he's pretty good.

715
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I mean, he's strong in the water.

716
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Yeah, he's strong.

717
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Zeke's been pretty open about whatever you all want.

718
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
Here's the question.

719
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Do we tell them we're voting for Michelle?

720
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
We could.

721
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
We could tell Zeke.

722
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
I think so.

723
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
All right, well, we tell him, then.

724
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
So we don't take any chances.

725
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Huge night tonight.

726
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,960
This is a crucial decision, and quite honestly,

727
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
I've made a different decision.

728
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Let's just do it.

729
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Yeah.

730
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,960
CC and Dave backstabbed me, and one of them has to go today.

731
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Dave bit me in the butt a couple times,

732
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,960
but he has at least some numbers that will survive this three

733
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
tribe situation that we're in.

734
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,960
I have to have a big alliance to protect me in a merge,

735
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,960
so we're going to vote CC off tonight.

736
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Hey.

737
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,960
Me and you just set out in really big boo, isn't it?

738
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Right.

739
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
We bumped up.

740
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
We can't get rid of Zeke.

741
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Right.

742
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
I mean, I hate to say it, but we need to think this thing

743
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
through tonight.

744
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,960
This is a pivotal moment, and if we make the wrong move here...

745
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
You're thinking CC?

746
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
Well, I don't want to.

747
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Right.

748
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
But we're kind of decimated here.

749
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
It sounds like Chris wants to vote off CC,

750
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
and I'm extremely nervous about that.

751
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Chris has on his side Zeke and Michelle,

752
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,960
so I think I should just go along with the plan

753
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
and make him believe he can trust me.

754
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,960
So it's CC.

755
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
I mean...

756
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
I'll do it.

757
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
I swear to God, I'll do it.

758
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
I just want you to think it through.

759
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
I don't even need to.

760
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,960
If we can come together, we can benefit each other.

761
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Now, whether Dave will stay to his word or not, I don't know.

762
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm trusting a guy that's barked me twice.

763
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Hey, uh...

764
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Yeah?

765
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Michelle, we just wanted to let you know

766
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
why CC's gone with this one.

767
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
It's Christmas.

768
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
It's Christmas.

769
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
You're safe tonight.

770
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
Both of you are safe tonight.

771
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Yeah.

772
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Both of you.

773
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Thank you, guys.

774
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Yeah, no, you guys are awesome.

775
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
David and Chris say, it's not you, we're voting CC.

776
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
But how do you trust it?

777
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,960
So no matter what is said at Tribal, you vote CC.

778
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Okay.

779
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,960
And if it's not, I'm gonna be the first one

780
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,960
to ever, like, choke David in front of the whole nation.

781
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
And it all ain't pro-Chep Rho.

782
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
I know, I know, I know.

783
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
There's a thousand possibilities

784
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
that he's not telling the truth.

785
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,960
I'm not gonna sit back and let other people decide my fate

786
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,960
because that's not how I'm used to doing things.

787
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Don't feel defeated.

788
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
You enjoying it?

789
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Yeah, I'm enjoying it.

790
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
It's still tough, you know?

791
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Yeah.

792
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
This game is just like...

793
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,960
You know that I know that, like,

794
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,960
either me or Zeke, probably me,

795
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
there's a lot of trying to do.

796
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
I know that.

797
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Yeah.

798
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Like, that just makes me, I see that.

799
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Right.

800
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
But I know that I can do better than you.

801
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
I weigh more, I'm stronger.

802
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
I have great upper body strength.

803
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm great with puzzles.

804
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,960
I just don't, I just don't see a benefit in carrying out a plan.

805
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
You definitely have a point.

806
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,960
And you know that since I know I'm on the bottom,

807
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
like, I'm willing to make a deal.

808
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Oh, yeah.

809
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
I tried to talk strategy with her,

810
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
and I can't get anywhere.

811
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,960
So all I can do right now is hope that David and Chris

812
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
are telling me the truth and hope for the best.

813
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
She knows she's going home.

814
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
But she wants to vote you out.

815
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Vote me out?

816
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Why does she want to vote me out?

817
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,960
She said you're the weakest and you're clumsy.

818
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,960
That's what every girl says about me.

819
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Chris and I had talked, and we decided that we would work

820
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,960
with the millennials to vote for Cece.

821
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
But I really don't trust Michelle.

822
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,960
She wanted to woo Cece over and target me.

823
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,960
Once Cece is gone, I would be the weakest person of our tribe.

824
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,960
And I worry that Chris, Michelle, and Zeke could form a voting

825
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
block and vote me out in the next tribal.

826
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,960
And it's got me thinking whether or not I should give my idol

827
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,960
to Cece and then vote off Michelle.

828
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I play a lot of chess.

829
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
And the thing about chess, if you're going to play a good game,

830
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,960
is you have to look as many moves ahead as you can.

831
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:50,960
And if it means betraying an alliance or people that trust you, do it.

832
00:35:50,960 --> 00:36:05,960
All right, so let's talk about the challenge today.

833
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Zeke, this is your first challenge as a new tribe.

834
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
What were the stakes?

835
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Well, I think for Michelle and I, we see that we're clearly on the bottom.

836
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,960
We know that the millennials are dominating the other two tribes.

837
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,960
We both felt if we ended up here, one of the two of us is going home.

838
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,960
David, when you have a three and a two, there's always one idea,

839
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,960
which is who's three on the three?

840
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Who's the bottom?

841
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Because we'll make you top over here.

842
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
That's always an option.

843
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,960
But I do feel that the Gen X3 sitting up here tonight are very strong.

844
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,960
And I don't think any of us have the insecurity that we're on the bottom,

845
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,960
though, of course, that can't possibly be true.

846
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Zeke, there it is.

847
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
You talk about being the bottom.

848
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,960
You could become the top if you can just get one of these three to join you.

849
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Yeah, that's the trick.

850
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
And look, I know it's intimidating.

851
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
I know you don't want to work with a millennial

852
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,960
because you see a massive millennial advantage.

853
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
But you're not going to move further in this game

854
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,960
without connections to millennials, and I provide that.

855
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,960
And I'm ready to make a move with the Gen Xers if that's what I need to do.

856
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Chris, Survivor is a big game with a lot of moving parts

857
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,960
and the thought that all the millennials are going to stick together

858
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,960
while on three separate tribes right now could be foolish.

859
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Well, yeah, I don't think they're going to stick together,

860
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,960
but we can't be unaware of the situation.

861
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Gen X is down numbers, and we do need millennials to help going forward.

862
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,960
So did you feel Michelle or Zeke trying to work David, CeCe, and yourself?

863
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
You bet. You bet.

864
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,960
They haven't given up, that's for sure.

865
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
And I've talked a lot with Zeke.

866
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
We're both Oklahoma boys.

867
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,960
He's a big Sooner fan, and, of course, I've played,

868
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,960
so I have a lot in common with Zeke, and that may surprise people,

869
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,960
the big country boy and the New York kid.

870
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,960
CeCe, what level of concern do you have when you see one of your three Gen Xers,

871
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Chris, talking with Zeke?

872
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
It definitely raises concern.

873
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,960
You know, going forward, Chris may be willing to vote out a Gen X to save Zeke.

874
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,960
So, Chris, it sounds like this is a question of when does the game play begin?

875
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,960
The last two Tribals I've been to, I've been blind-fited.

876
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,960
So this vote tonight is really a chance for us to build back a really strong bond

877
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
and be really close.

878
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,960
David, has there been talk about previous Tribals and what may or may not have happened?

879
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Yes, there has been, and, you know, I do understand Chris' concerns

880
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,960
about whether or not he can trust me, and we actually talked about that today.

881
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,960
I mean, trust is paramount tonight, and I keep finding myself in the position

882
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,960
of having to prove my loyalty, and I own that, and tonight I'm going to do that.

883
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,960
Chris, the other specific thing David said was he needs to prove his trust.

884
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
Do you understand that?

885
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Yeah, David, he got me a couple of times, and I don't like to be reckless or anything,

886
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,960
but sometimes you've got to take a risk, and I'm taking a risk on David and I,

887
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,960
but I specifically told him, if you're doing it again,

888
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,960
I better be sitting right up there tonight.

889
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
I think you said you were going to choke me.

890
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,960
I might have said that too, but I was kidding on that.

891
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Michelle, that is the best thing you can hope to hear, is that there were problems in that group.

892
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Yeah, I personally don't see how there could be very much trust there,

893
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
especially continuing forward.

894
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,960
I just wonder why would you want to try to work with someone who's blindsided you twice?

895
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,960
So who do you think should be voted out tonight?

896
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
I think I would put out David.

897
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
This is fun.

898
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,960
David, it can't surprise you, though.

899
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,960
If you're sitting in their seat, you've got to get that vote off your shoulder onto somebody else's.

900
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Understandably, but I think that if the Gen X3 sitting up here tonight are truly united,

901
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
we have nothing to worry about.

902
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Okay, it is time to vote.

903
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Cece, you're up.

904
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,960
I'll go tally the votes.

905
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,960
If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.

906
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final.

907
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.

908
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,960
I'll read the votes.

909
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,960
First vote, Michelle.

910
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Cece, one vote Michelle, one vote Cece.

911
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Cece, that's two votes Cece, one vote Michelle.

912
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
Fifth person voted out.

913
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Cece, that's three, that's enough, you can bring me your torch.

914
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Cece, tribe is spoken.

915
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Good luck, guys.

916
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Well, if there's one thing this group of four can take comfort in, it's knowing you can trust each other.

917
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,960
Unless, of course, you're the one being lied to.

918
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night.

919
00:41:48,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

920
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,960
Next time on Survivor, Figgy lets her guard down.

921
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Taylor and I kind of have a thing.

922
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
You think?

923
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
It's obvious.

924
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,960
While a challenge leaves the survivors spinning.

925
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Sunday, dizzy now.

926
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
She's spinning.

927
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Hey, medical.

928
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
You're not going to let me die.

929
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
It's insane.

930
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
I was blindsided.

931
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,960
My two fellow Gen Xers voted against me and going forward, they're going to lose.

932
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
I think it was the dumbest mistake that they made.

933
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,960
I feel betrayed, you know, but I played as hard as I could.

934
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,960
I strategized, I snuck in, and I absolutely believe that my kids are going to be very proud how far I came in a game.

935
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
And that I did my best.
