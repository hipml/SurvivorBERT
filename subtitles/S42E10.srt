1
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,644
JONATHAN: We still have
a fire going, guys.

2
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,746
MARYANNE:
We still have a fire.

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:13,947
DREA:
And we had
a successful blindside today.

4
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,218
I shook his hand, and he gave me
his word, and he played me.

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,786
And am I right, Drea?

6
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,822
He was thinking
he's untouchable.

7
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,657
-He's, like,
giving me marching orders...
-DREA: Yeah.

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,160
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Wait. Can you hear it?</i>

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,495
Can you hear that?

10
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,196
You know what that is?

11
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,698
That's Hai's head
rolling down the road

12
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,999
because we lopped his head off,

13
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,034
<i>just like he deserved.</i>

14
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,470
<i>Because Hai was playing</i>
<i>too many different games</i>

15
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,772
<i>and got too full of himself.</i>

16
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,840
-Final seven.
-LINDSAY: Final seven.

17
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,475
-MIKE: Congratulations,
everybody.
-LINDSAY: Yeah.

18
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,411
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Hai thought he was the king, but</i>

19
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,146
his peasants banded together

20
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,048
<i>and set into motion the biggest</i>
<i>blindside of the season.</i>

21
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,650
<i>And quite frankly,</i>
<i>I've orchestrated</i>

22
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,951
right from the beginning.

23
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,553
ROMEO:
I hate to say it,

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,555
but that was the Tribal
that I enjoyed the most.

25
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,457
Yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

26
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,725
He kept saying my name,

27
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,661
so I wanted that
for a long time.

28
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,996
<i>I'm playing this game</i>
<i>super chill</i>

29
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:05,498
<i>and under the radar because</i>

30
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,333
the inevitable is happening.
Everyone's looking

31
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,702
<i>to take out these big threats.</i>

32
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,037
<i>And it's perfect for me.</i>

33
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,338
<i>I can just sit back</i>

34
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,674
<i>and let these big egos</i>

35
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,410
<i>eat each other up, and then</i>

36
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,746
the underdogs
can take over this game.

37
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,452
I guess tomorrow we'll figure
out how much we really have.

38
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,255
Yeah.

39
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,196
Yeah.

40
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,864
<i>So, now</i>

41
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:43,336
that Hai is gone, the amulet
is now a Steal the Vote,

42
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,506
<i>which myself and Drea are able</i>
<i>to use if we work together.</i>

43
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:50,076
<i>So we now have</i>
<i>some extra ammo for us</i>

44
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,212
<i>to use</i>
<i>to dwindle down the threats</i>

45
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,214
<i>that might get in the way</i>
<i>of our game to the final.</i>

46
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,049
The game's getting spicy now.

47
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,794
DREA:
I went...

48
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,128
-I was in St. Martin.
-MARYANNE: Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,763
And I went to take pictures
of a friend.

50
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,266
-Uh-huh.
-She's like, "Come take pictures
of me in my swimsuit."

51
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,602
And she had very, like, thong
swimsuits and stuff like that.

52
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,237
And it's like a wedding, and
I was just like, "You go, girl."

53
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,772
-(gasps)
-Like, she was really taking
the pictures. Like...

54
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,274
MIKE:
I saw it hang...

55
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,009
-Actually, I saw it hanging.
-Yeah.
-Oh, my gosh.

56
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,244
-Which one happ...?
-LINDSAY: Which one? The pinkie?
-It's fine.

57
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,378
I actually lose my pinkie toes

58
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,713
-pretty often.
-That's odd to say.

59
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,248
-What?
-Oh, yeah.
-They're so small.

60
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,549
LINDSAY:
No, no, no,

61
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,117
it's not normal
to lose your toenails like that.

62
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,020
-I'm so confused.
-MARYANNE: No, no.

63
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,389
They fall off, like, maybe,
like, two or three times a year.

64
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,757
Mine's never fallen off.

65
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,326
-No, but they...
-Like, that's regularly?

66
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,861
Like, that you have
an annual amount?

67
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,796
-Like...
-(laughter)

68
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,164
LINDSAY:
Two or three times a year.

69
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,666
-Like...
-MIKE: Hey, there's normal,

70
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,901
-and then there's Maryanne.
-MARYANNE: Like, I don't...

71
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,269
-MIKE: Yeah.
-LINDSAY: Yeah, right.

72
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,303
<i>MARYANNE:</i>
<i>I've never been more miserable</i>

73
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,405
<i>or more hungry or more painful,</i>

74
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,607
but I'm having so much fun
out here, man.

75
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,009
<i>I don't want it to end.</i>

76
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,210
How has someone
not addressed this

77
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,278
-to her before? Like...
-MARYANNE: No.

78
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,113
<i>Clearly, right now,</i>

79
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,581
<i>I'm not as big of a threat</i>

80
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,082
<i>as people think that I am,</i>
<i>which is a blessing</i>

81
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,518
'cause that means I'm probably
safe for the next Tribal,

82
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,120
but a curse, because if people
don't think you're a threat,

83
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,521
how are you going
to win at the end?

84
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,423
<i>But I've been really</i>
<i>taking a step back</i>

85
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,192
<i>because if you're someone</i>
<i>who's a big threat,</i>

86
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,727
<i>you're the next one out.</i>

87
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,065
MARYANNE:
I think
they're going after each other.

88
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,500
Who would have thought
that the people

89
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,935
on the bottom are now
in the power position?

90
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,837
It's<i> Survivor</i> flip.
The bottom's at the top,

91
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,406
-and the top's at the bottom.
-Yup.

92
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,979
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I'm telling you right now,</i>

93
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,414
-this ain't brain surgery.
-No.

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,782
-No.
-It's really not.

95
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,684
If there's five,
and we're the best five,

96
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,452
let us fight it out.

97
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,887
I mean, who wouldn't...? Okay.

98
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,288
It surprises me that the two
of them are still here.

99
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,990
-JONATHAN: Yup.
-DREA: Yeah.

100
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,792
MIKE:
Romeo-- it just bothers me
that he's just not working.

101
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,360
It's literally...
And he doesn't care.

102
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,695
-No.
-He just sits there
while we're all working.

103
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,630
Don't know if I've ever
seen him do anything.

104
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,664
This is the movement I see.

105
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,466
Into the pot, into his mouth.

106
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,335
That's the only movement I see.

107
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,537
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>He keeps going, dipping in,</i>
<i>and then he eats the bottom.</i>

108
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,606
<i>You know, at the end</i>
<i>when you can lick the spoon,</i>

109
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,040
<i>from when you're...</i>
<i>they're making a cake?</i>

110
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,043
<i>-He licked the spoon.</i>
<i>-(laughter)</i>

111
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,578
DREA:
Yeah.

112
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,779
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>You know what his best move is?</i>

113
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,616
This.

114
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,251
<i>That's his exercise.</i>
<i>That's what he does.</i>

115
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,953
<i>Romeo, Romeo,</i>
<i>wherefore art thou, Romeo?</i>

116
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,023
<i>He's sitting in the same spot</i>
<i>that he sat in 20 days ago.</i>

117
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,859
Hasn't moved.
That's where Romeo art thou.

118
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,062
<i>ROMEO:</i>
<i>Screw them.</i>

119
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,799
<i>I'm not doing anything for</i>
<i>anybody but myself out here, so,</i>

120
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,068
hell yes, I'm gonna eat
that rice. I'm hungry.

121
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,236
MIKE:
And it's not personal. I'm sure

122
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,504
I would love him
in a regular life,

123
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,640
-but not here.
-DREA: It's been aggravating me.

124
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,008
-Yeah.
-So what do you guys want to do?

125
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,976
Take this to the final five?

126
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,411
-MIKE: I'm in.
-And duke it from there?

127
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,879
-JONATHAN: Yes.
-MIKE: I'm in 100%.

128
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,280
-You're in?
-Yeah.

129
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,782
<i>DREA:</i>
<i>I'm a competitor.</i>

130
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,384
<i>I'd rather play against people</i>
<i>who have been</i>

131
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,586
<i>playing hard the whole time.</i>
<i>Like, we came</i>

132
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,421
to play for a million bucks,
and I want to go with the people

133
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,189
who are playing
for a million bucks.

134
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,092
-MIKE: I know.
-JONATHAN: He just eats.
He never cooks.

135
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,427
<i>DREA:</i>
<i>Romeo literally sits</i>

136
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,362
<i>in the same spot</i>
<i>throughout the entire day</i>

137
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,364
<i>but then will eat</i>
<i>the scraps of rice.</i>

138
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,967
<i>I feel so bad because</i>
<i>he's been with me since day one,</i>

139
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,435
<i>but I cannot.</i>

140
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,805
It's like, "Aah!"
It bothers me so much.

141
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,775
Bah! Aah!

142
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,243
We're gonna do the final five,
and then we duke it out

143
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,145
from there right here.

144
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,213
I give you my...
Listen, I give you my word.

145
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,882
-Same. Yeah. Same.
-I give youse my word.

146
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,583
-OMAR: I'm down.
-DREA: Let's do this.

147
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,755
-...bounds, uh, out there.
-Uh, I mean, no, right?

148
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,891
But what are you thinking?
To go with that?

149
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,462
<i>I was saying,</i>
<i>"Top five, us five,</i>

150
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,698
<i>the people</i>
<i>that deserve to be here." But</i>

151
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,932
it's mainly a game,
so Drea sees it

152
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,333
and she believes it,
and she votes for Romeo.

153
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,636
Ah.

154
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,538
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>To make Drea feel comfortable</i>
<i>that we're</i>

155
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,173
<i>all together in this,</i>
<i>and I think she bought it.</i>

156
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,941
<i>I hope she bought it.</i>

157
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,512
Listen, Drea gets to the final
three, she's gonna win, and...

158
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,916
<i>I got to look</i>
<i>at the big picture here.</i>

159
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,517
<i>And the big picture is,</i>

160
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,386
<i>Drea's the biggest threat left</i>

161
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,321
that I'm not working with.

162
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,057
-Drea is extremely good.
-She is good.

163
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,327
I'm actually really thirsty.

164
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,629
Are you guys gonna be done
with the water yet?

165
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,565
(laughing):
Drea.

166
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,000
-Yeah, we're coming.
-What are they saying?

167
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,669
They want us to be back
with the water.

168
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,771
I actually need my water!

169
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,106
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>At this point in the game,</i>

170
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,640
<i>people want</i>
<i>to push their agenda.</i>

171
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,976
<i>And after this big blindside</i>

172
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,845
<i>on Hai,</i>
<i>Mike's getting a little like,</i>

173
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,446
"Hmm. I just pulled off
my first big move,

174
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,081
"and now I'm the big man

175
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,584
<i>who can rule and</i>
<i>tell people what to do."</i>

176
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,720
<i>But, like, people will go</i>
<i>after people like that.</i>

177
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,757
He's feeling high after Hai,
if you know what I mean.

178
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,759
<i>So I don't trust anything</i>
<i>Mike says anymore.</i>

179
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,528
<i>I think that he's playing harder</i>
<i>than he's letting on,</i>

180
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,663
<i>and you can tell he's become</i>

181
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,032
what he was accusing Hai
of doing.

182
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,734
He's become the new Hai,

183
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,970
<i>and that's not going to work</i>
<i>for him out here.</i>

184
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,006
<i>I can tell you that right now.</i>

185
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,521
<i>LINDSAY: I just can't believe</i>
<i>there was no food.</i>

186
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,690
-Like, this really is
way different.
-Yeah. (sighs)

187
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,460
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

188
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,795
Like,
we're all feeling it today.

189
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,129
-Oh, yeah.
-Yes. Oh, my God.

190
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,330
-Like, it hit all of us,
you know?
-Yeah.

191
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,068
DREA:
Yeah. Minnows? Yeah.

192
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,338
<i>JONATHAN: Coming into this,</i>
<i>one of the things that I did</i>

193
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,375
was go, "I'm gonna eat the
same amount as everybody else,

194
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,744
not put a target on my back,"
and it's worked.

195
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,612
I'm here. I'm at the top seven.

196
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,283
<i>But I burn 2,000 calories</i>

197
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,952
<i>a day not doing anything.</i>

198
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,255
<i>I'm getting to the point</i>
<i>where moving is-is rough.</i>

199
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,324
Jonathan, we're at the beach.

200
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,964
<i>JONATHAN:</i>
<i>People here are literally</i>
<i>half my size,</i>

201
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:49,502
<i>and they're eating the same</i>
<i>amount as I am, so I have it</i>

202
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,604
a little worse than everybody
here, and that's the truth.

203
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,606
How long have I been
laying here?

204
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,141
ROMEO:
Over an hour.

205
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,643
-Is there anybody around?
-No, they're all at the beach.

206
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,911
Everybody?

207
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,481
I'll walk down there
with you in a second.

208
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,583
All right.

209
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,717
<i>JONATHAN:</i>
<i>I wanted to be</i>

210
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,886
the provider,
and I've done that.

211
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,622
<i>I'm still the one</i>
<i>that starts the fires.</i>

212
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,490
<i>I'm still the one</i>
<i>that catches the fish.</i>

213
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,026
<i>Six more days, and I can</i>

214
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,595
hopefully win this game
and move on.

215
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,799
But nobody sees how hard it is
for me, which is my game plan.

216
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,267
I don't want 'em to see.

217
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,503
LINDSAY:
So, how does this exactly work?

218
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,574
What do you do with it?
Meaning what?

219
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,178
Okay.

220
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,813
The little string
from the big string?

221
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,349
JONATHAN:
Little strings
from the big string, yes.

222
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,125
Huh? Uh, there's two people
working on it,

223
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,527
-so I'd kind of get in the way.
-MIKE: I...

224
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,603
JONATHAN:
Everybody, take it easy on me.
I'm doing everything

225
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,805
I can do. Okay, Drea?

226
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:06,212
<i>DREA:</i>
<i>Jonathan is acting hangry</i>
<i>and kind of rude.</i>

227
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,748
<i>Kind of pisses me off.</i>
<i>I was just beyond</i>

228
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,417
shocked at how he was
approaching the situation.

229
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,718
-You're the fisherman.
-Yeah.

230
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,153
This is why I was like,
"Can you help?"

231
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,127
Are you kidding me?

232
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,762
If it wasn't for us
coming to get it,

233
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,864
he would have still
just been laying around.

234
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,732
<i>I really wanted to work</i>

235
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,468
<i>with strong players,</i>
<i>but Jonathan's lost</i>

236
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,604
a tremendous amount of weight.
He's weak.

237
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,507
<i>And I have no empathy for him</i>
<i>cause I'm on the same page.</i>

238
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,576
<i>I'm allergic to coconut,</i>
<i>so I can't eat coconut, so,</i>

239
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,145
I'm literally starving.

240
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,214
It comes off rude because...

241
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,183
I'm the one doing it all.

242
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,851
<i>I could use a thank-you.</i>

243
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,954
<i>The provider is supposed</i>
<i>to get props.</i>

244
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,589
<i>I want to be</i>
<i>a little more appreciated</i>

245
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,059
because if it's not seen,

246
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,094
then it's not working.

247
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,562
But...

248
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,830
But the way you talk
to people is not...

249
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,198
-Yeah.
-That's not okay with me.

250
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,033
Yeah, I hear you.

251
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,635
<i>JONATHAN:</i>
<i>I have held my tongue</i>

252
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,403
so much.

253
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,373
<i>But just because</i>
<i>of that bickering, I know</i>

254
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,041
that that's gonna...
that's gonna put a seed

255
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,943
in their mind
to try to vote me off now.

256
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,381
He's in his mood...

257
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,661
<i>LINDSAY:</i>
<i>Jonathan's starting to unravel.</i>

258
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,563
And people are picking up
on that.

259
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,898
<i>It's perfect timing because</i>

260
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,168
<i>I want Jonathan out because</i>
<i>of how he acts towards me.</i>

261
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,737
He's not a great ally.
He just dictates

262
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,038
on what I should do,
and if I disagree,

263
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,439
he gets annoyed with me.

264
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,847
Mm-hmm.

265
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,990
Yeah.

266
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,632
<i>Jonathan's the one person</i>

267
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,200
getting in the way
of me winning more challenges.

268
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,170
<i>But I know</i>
<i>what I'm capable of doing.</i>

269
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,406
<i>So it's balls to the wall</i>
<i>going all out</i>

270
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,642
<i>to make sure</i>
<i>Jonathan loses and goes home.</i>

271
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,520
All right,
seven players left in the game,

272
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,756
and today is the dangerous
Do or Die twist.

273
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:34,060
<i>It's a risky game of chance,</i>

274
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,062
<i>but it could be an opportunity</i>
<i>for somebody on the bottom.</i>

275
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,696
<i>If they win,</i>

276
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,198
they're safe,
can't be voted out.

277
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,833
If they lose, they're out,

278
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,402
but there is no vote involved,
and nothing can save them.

279
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,671
It is them against the game.

280
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,173
<i>Last season when we did this,</i>

281
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,942
<i>Deshawn was in trouble.</i>
<i>He played Do or Die and won.</i>

282
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,646
<i>They couldn't vote him out.</i>
<i>He made it to the final three.</i>

283
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,914
There's no easy choice.

284
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,549
If you need immunity,
you have to compete.

285
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,350
But if you compete,
and you're first out,

286
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,419
you got to play Do or Die.
What would you do?

287
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,354
And remember,
they've not seen season 41.

288
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,256
They're going to be shocked.

289
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,825
Come on in.

290
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,304
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

291
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,106
-Yeah.
-Yes.
-First things first, Lindsay.

292
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,275
Got to take it back.

293
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,212
-Thank you.
-Yup.

294
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,852
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

295
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,787
<i>For today's challenge,</i>
<i>you're going to balance</i>

296
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,522
<i>on a narrow perch</i>
<i>while holding a handle</i>

297
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,791
<i>behind your head.</i>
<i>At any point,</i>

298
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:43,295
<i>a foot comes off,</i>
<i>or a hand lets go, you're out.</i>

299
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,598
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

300
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,467
guaranteed a spot
in the final six.

301
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,504
There is a twist
to today's challenge.

302
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,374
And it's a dangerous one,

303
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,677
but if you think you're
on the bottom, it could help.

304
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,579
Here's how it works.

305
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,015
The first person
to fall out of this challenge

306
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,684
will have to play a potentially

307
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,821
deadly game of chance
called<i> Survivor</i> Do or Die.

308
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,156
-What?
-What?

309
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,524
PROBST:
Tonight at Tribal Council,

310
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,026
the first person to fall out
of this challenge

311
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,861
will play this game of chance.

312
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,098
If you win, you're safe
and cannot be voted out.

313
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:23,502
Then we have a regular Tribal,
and somebody else is voted out.

314
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,538
If you lose, you're out,
and that's it.

315
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,307
-Oh!
-PROBST: Nothing can
protect you,

316
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,110
no idols, no advantage,
no Shot in the Dark, nothing.

317
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,845
It is you against the game.

318
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:36,182
So, your decision right now is,

319
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,385
do I compete or not?

320
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,887
-Whoa.
-PROBST: If you think
you need immunity,

321
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,323
you got to compete.
A lot of this comes down

322
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,625
to where you believe
you sit in the game.

323
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,929
How much knowledge do you have
about your relationships?

324
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,898
Because several people here
don't need immunity tonight.

325
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,267
Most of you are not going home.
One is.

326
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,404
If you think you're the one,
Do or Die is an option.

327
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,807
Remember, Do or Die
doesn't mean you're out.

328
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,909
It could mean
you're totally safe.

329

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,380
<i>that I fought,</i>
<i>and I'm not out of the game yet.</i>

501
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,548
MIKE:
I let my head...

502
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,918
Which is what I should've done.

503
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,419
DREA:
No, don't say that.
No, don't live with regrets.

504
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,421
You don't know what it is yet,
you know?

505
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,957
-You don't...
-You're acting
like you're already home.

506
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,158
-Like...
-Mm-hmm.
-LINDSAY: Yeah.

507
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,626
We'll see what happens.

508
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,695
<i>DREA: It was bittersweet 'cause</i>
<i>I was rooting for my girl,</i>

509
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,030
<i>but at the same time,</i>

510
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,999
I am hoping
Lindsay goes home tonight.

511
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,768
(laughs)

512
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,737
Obviously I'm not
gonna tell her that,

513
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,305
<i>but, like, if she goes home,</i>

514
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,807
<i>there's only one amulet</i>
<i>left in the game.</i>

515
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,244
And that means
that my amulet becomes an idol.

516
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,114
So then that would mean
I have an idol in my bag,

517
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,051
plus the Knowledge
Is Power advantage.

518
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,120
<i>I also have my extra vote.</i>

519
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,821
<i>So tonight is</i>
<i>a major night for me.</i>

520
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,623
But if Lindsay does
her Do or Die

521
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,958
and she's still in the game,

522
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,726
<i>we will have to send</i>
<i>someone else home.</i>

523
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,429
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>Romeo's name is out there</i>

524
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,165
<i>because Romeo doesn't really</i>
<i>do that much around camp.</i>

525
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,266
-It's Romeo.
-Yeah.

526
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,501
Please.

527
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,702
-I'm sticking to the plan.
-I'm gonna...

528
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,103
'Cause I think I'm playing
my idol tonight,

529
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,372
-'cause I'm nervous.
-No. I'm sticking to the plan.

530
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,908
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Yesterday,</i>
<i>I set up a little plan</i>

531
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,777
<i>that the decoy vote tonight</i>
<i>is Romeo.</i>

532
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:32,778
<i>Thankfully,</i>

533
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,813
Drea bought my story.

534
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,516
<i>Because if Lindsay doesn't go</i>
<i>out tonight, I want Drea out.</i>

535
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,419
...we have a straight line
to the final four.

536
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,221
Right, and she's a huge threat.

537
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,589
-We'd be crazy.
-Right.

538
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,224
<i>Drea's a threat.</i>
<i>She's super likable.</i>

539
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,059
I think she's
a great badass woman.

540
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,929
<i>And I would have</i>
<i>the only amulet left.</i>

541
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:51,930
<i>I would have an idol</i>
<i>in my pocket</i>

542

-I got you...
-All right, love you, baby.

545
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,501
I'll see you later.

<i>LINDSAY:</i>

<i>I don't want to be</i>

550
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,480
Drea has more on her résumé

<i>than me.</i>

552
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,849
<i>She'd be hard to beat.</i>

If she makes it to the final
three, she's gonna win.

554

Yeah.

-Hey, I'm just

-Yeah.

<i>She's always been</i>

558
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,961
If anybody lets her get

00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,863
Point blank. Period.

560
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,332

-Got you. Okay, cool.

562
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,202
All right, thank you.

<i>Boom, boom, boom, like dominoes</i>

There's five days left.

00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,042

00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,023
MIKE:
But she also
can't be aware of it,

573
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,092
-because she has the extra vote.
-Yeah.

574
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,729
-Yeah.
-OMAR: Okay.

575
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,397
<i>Knocking Drea out here</i>
<i>removes an extra vote</i>

576
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,566
and removes a player

577
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,768
<i>a really strong contender</i>
<i>at the end of the game.</i>

578
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,805
Oh, yeah, you should.

579
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,406
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>But the smarter side of me says,</i>

580
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,375
"Mike is a threat to win,

581
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,744
<i>and I want to blindside him</i>
<i>and make a big move."</i>

582
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,180
<i>But at this point,</i>
<i>I feel like it's too risky,</i>

583
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,182
<i>'cause Mike has</i>
<i>that hidden immunity idol.</i>

584
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,184
<i>And so,</i>

585
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,620
<i>If Lindsay is safe,</i>

DREA:
Wait, you were praying?

588
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,059
Okay. Geez.

589
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,662
<i>I could feel</i>
<i>my stomach turning.</i>

590
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:31,796
I've been staring at people

591
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,832
and observe, like,
how they're moving,

592
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,567
<i>how they're acting,</i>
<i>who they're talking to.</i>

593
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,303
<i>It's weird.</i>
<i>It's a very weird vibe.</i>

594
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,105
Mike is saying that it's Romeo,

595
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,341
<i>but now my gut tells me</i>
<i>that Mike is lying to me.</i>

596
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,911
So... is the plan

597
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,212
<i>-Romeo?</i>
<i>-DREA: Mm-hmm.</i>

598
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,716
<i>-DREA: Yes.</i>
<i>-OMAR: And then</i>

599
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,285
we have to try to get Mike
to play his immunity idol,

600
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,319
basically.

601
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,987
I'm gonna take
his immunity idol.

602
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,622
-You can take it?
-Yes.

603
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:58,723
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

604
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,392
You can take it from him?
(chuckles softly)

605
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,694
-You're the only person
I've told, Omar.
-Okay.

606
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,496
-You're literally
the only person I've told.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:07,265
It's before the votes.
I have to say, "Hey, Jeff."

608
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,667
-It's public?
-Yeah.

609
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,668
(gasps)

610
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,835
(soft laughter)

611
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,903
Mike does not know

612
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,638
that I have
the Knowledge Is Power

613
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,041

to take his idol tonight.

614
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,812
(laughter)

615
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,114

<i>Omar is someone that I can work</i>
<i>with towards the finish line.</i>

617
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,753
Mike told me

-His immunity idol?
-Yeah.

619
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,389
So...

620
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,291
we may have to vote Mike today.

621
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,263
<i>DREA:</i>
<i>We have to.</i>

622
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,264

629
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,678
It's the perfect time
to take him out,

00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,080
'cause he won't see it coming.

631
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,614
And with Drea stealing his idol,

00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,983
<i>he has no backup protection.</i>

633
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,718

'Cause he will

635
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,993

-I agree.

636
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,162
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>This is big,</i>
<i>because Drea told me her power.</i>

638
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,634
So, she will steal Mike's
hidden immunity idol tonight,

639
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,436

-I know...
-It changes everything.

648
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,250
LINDSAY:
Because we can blindside Mike

649
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,452
<i>or--</i>
<i>telling him what the power is--</i>

650

<i>Mike gives us the idol.</i>

651
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,123
And this way, we still have
control of where the idol is.

652
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,793
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>By removing the idol from Mike's</i>
<i>pocket and putting it in mine,</i>

653
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,430
Drea's advantage
is basically neutered

654
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,732
<i>and so is Mike's</i>
<i>'cause he doesn't have his idol.</i>

655

<i>And then it's, like,</i>
<i>free for the taking.</i>

656
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,102
You can take either one out.

657

-My gut says to take out Mike.
-My gut says...

658

I know, but my gut says
I don't trust Drea as much.

659
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,674

that I could go.

<i>We let Drea steal Mike's idol,</i>

today's immunity challenge

679

If I need immunity,
I got to compete.

680

But if I compete

681
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,750
I got to play Do or Die.

what was the thought process

684

of why you were
going to compete?

I know that I need it, Mr. Jeff.

I mean,
we're this close to the end,

no real choice for me.

688

-I had to commit and do it.

that stood up
and said "I'm competing."

691
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,072
Honestly, my competitive nature

692
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,175
overtook my gut,
and I made a poor choice.

693
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:41,146
And I was blinded
without double-checking

694
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,780
does this make sense
in the game to do?

695
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,883
Mike, what was it like
to watch these two?

696
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,651
Because it was
a pretty intense battle.

697
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,319
Their bodies gave out.

698
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,721
MIKE:
It was unbelievable.
I got to be honest with you.

699
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,623
I have total respect
for both of them.

700
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,625
And I know Lindsay said
she did a stupid thing.

I don't think
she did a stupid thing at all.

702
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,327
I think she did a warrior thing.

703
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,030
Whatever happens tonight,
Lindsay's gonna be fine.

704
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,498
She's a remarkable young woman.

705
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,367
She's gonna be successful
through life.

706
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,701
And what she did today

707
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,003
just showed the kind of person
that she really is,

708
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,671
and that's who I can respect.

709
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,872
MARYANNE:
And then also,

710
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,407
Lindsay and Jonathan have
always been head-to-head

711
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,042
every single competition.

712
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,477
So Lindsay going
and stepping up,

713
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,711
I don't think was
a bad decision

714
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:14,779
based on the track record.

715
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,214
And, like, I hope that,

716
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,049
however this turns out, that you
don't lose that competitiveness,

717
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,817
because that's a good trait
to have.

718
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,553
-And I want you
to know that, okay?
-Thank you.

Omar, was it hard
for you to sit out

721
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,926
from a competition
point of view?

722
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,028
I was sitting on the bench
watching them, very impressed,

723
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,831
but also happy with the decision
that I made, because I grew up,

724
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,534
my parents were like, "You get
an education, and that's it.

725
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,003
-You don't, you don't go
to gym class. I don't care."
-(laughter)

726
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,905
So, you know,
that's not my strength

727
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,941
-to go up against these two.
-(Maryanne laughs)

728
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,109
PROBST:
All right,
so you get back to camp.

729
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,878
Maryanne, what's the vibe?

730
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,180
Because you can't
"kind of" approach it

731
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,082
like there might be a vote,
'cause there might be a vote,

732
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,184
depending on what happens
with Do or Die.

733
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,520
MARYANNE:
The scrambling always starts,
you know?

734
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,021
And there's some people
who are going in,

735
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,423
they're pulling
many people aside.

736
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,791
There's some people
who are just like...

737
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,293
And then it's the head nod plan
or the scramble plan

738
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,795
-that goes tonight if...
-(Drea laughs)

739
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,363
And if it even happens.

740
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,431
PROBST:
So, Mike, does that mean

741
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,233
that there are literally
different ways

742
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,567
of communicating
for different plans

743
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,469
within different alliances?

744
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,470
MIKE:
Absolutely.

745
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,240
It's either... or it's...

746
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,141
But if you see this one,
get to the water well.

747
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,443
(laughter)

748
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,944
-You see this one, just relax.
-(Maryanne laughs)

749
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,146
So you kind of know
the winks and the nods.

750
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,183
PROBST:
Drea, when you see
the sign Mike talked about,

751
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,118
which is, you know, 911,

752
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,320
how do you react in the moment?

753
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,890
I see who he's looking at,
and I observe.

754
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,526
Just like I see
when Jonathan gets up

755
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,429
and tries to talk to numerous
people throughout the day.

756
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,797
And I observe.

757
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,733
And I see when numerous people
go to the water well,

758
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,369
and they come back and
their canteens are still empty.

759
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,637
I observe.

760
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,472
When they go for wood,

761
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,374
-but there's no wood
in their hands.
-(laughs)

762
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,009
I observe.

763
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,379
Omar, it was almost getting
like a horror movie,

764
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,680
-the way she's,
"I've been watching you."
-OMAR: Yeah. Yeah.

765
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,081
It's a creepy vibe.

766
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,517
Like, all of a sudden,
you introduce this twist,

767
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,286
and now we can't just
assume Lindsay's going home.

768
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,054
Somebody else may be going home.

769
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,857
Today was the most paranoid
I've ever seen people,

770
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,925
and it's weird, 'cause
we might not even have a vote.

771
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,495
PROBST:
Jonathan, what kind of energy

772
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,231
did you feel, knowing
that you were safe tonight?

773
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,233
When people talk to you,
it's a whole different level,

774
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,102
because they look at you
and go, "Well, Jonathan's safe.

775
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,438
So I can tell him more
or I can do more."

776
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,140
They work with you more.

777
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,110
PROBST:
Drea, that's really interesting,
because if somebody

778
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,379
were to tell Jonathan
more than they might normally--

779
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,249
because tonight he's safe--
and there is no vote,

780
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,685
then Jonathan just got
all this free information.

781
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,321
Him having
whatever information he has

782
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,556
doesn't change my gameplay.

783
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,426
I didn't come into<i> Survivor</i>
to just depend on other people

784
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,727
to help me get through.

785
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,128
Alliances are there,

786
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,764
but alliances also
flip on people, as we see.

787
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,534
So I play like it's my last day.

788
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,370
Listen, everything you say
in this game to somebody

789
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,806
means something about
or to somebody.

790
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,308
So you have to be careful
how you choose your words.

791
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,310
Even in just regular talk,

792
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,812
because people
misinterpret sometimes

793
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,947
what you say to mean
something different.

794
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,650
And you say, like,
"I didn't mean that at all."

795
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,652
PROBST:
Omar, that's also
very interesting,

796
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,020
in that Mike is saying sometimes

797
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,356
you could say something wrong,
even unintentionally.

798
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,592
Yeah, I mean, that's also
why you have to be careful

799
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,793
with the winks and the nods,

800
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,495
'cause people
might get the wrong idea.

801
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,664
And sometimes,
you need to know when to stop.

802
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,165
Because, like Mike said,

803
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,035
"You keep going, you're gonna
run out into the train tracks

804
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,236
and get run over."

PROBST:
All right,
before we go to the vote,

806
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,445
we have to determine if
there is going to be a vote.

00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,187
for<i> Survivor</i> to be played

1002
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,857
because it is just a game
and it is just an adventure,

1003
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,225
and it's an experience
with people

1004
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,626
that you're going
to know forever.

1005
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,294
-MIKE: Yup.
-I thought it was awesome.

1006
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,395
-Thank you.
-You've made it

1007
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:39,763
to the final six.
Grab your torches.

1008
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,998
-Head back to camp.
-Have a great night, Jeff.

1009
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,633
-Thank you. Have a good one.
-Good night.

1010
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,301
-LINDSAY: Oh, man.
-MIKE: Lindsay,

1011
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,370
