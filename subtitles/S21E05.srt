1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,627
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY
ON "SURVIVOR."

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,130
YOUNGER TRIBE WINS IMMUNITY!

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:08,591
YOUNGER TRIBE WINS IMMUNITY
AND REWARD!

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,261
THE OLDER TRIBE HAD LOST TWO
OF THREE CHALLENGES

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,387
AND STRUGGLED AT CAMP.

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,639
>> THAT WAS GOING TO WORK
IF IT DIDN'T HIT MY FOOT.

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,767
>> WE HAVE NO FOOD AND NO MEANS
OF GETTING IT.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,394
>> Jeff: BUT NONE OF THIS
PHASED MARTY

9
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,979
WHO WAS PRACTICALLY GIDDY

10
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,230
ABOUT BEING THE UNDISPUTED
TRIBE ZVENGALI.

11
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,315
>> THOSE THAT WANT TO PLAY
WITH ME, JUMP ON BOARD.

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,317
DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH ME.

13
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,861
I MEAN, I'M PLAYING
THIS GAME FOR REAL.

14
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,821
>> Jeff: AT THE YOUNGER TRIBE,
BRENDA WAS THE MASTERMIND.

15
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,114
>> I HAVE PEOPLE ON MY SIDE
WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING.

16
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,784
>> Jeff: AND HER ALLY, NAONKA,
WAS THE CAMP BULLY.

17
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,412
NAONKA'S MAIN TARGET
WAS KELLY B.,

18
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,122
THE TRIBE MATE
WITH THE ARTIFICIAL LEG.

19
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,290
SHE KNOCKED HER DOWN
AND YELLED AT HER.

20
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,125
>> I DON'T LIKE YOU,
NEVER HAVE LIKED YOU.

21
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,293
>> NAONKA'S PSYCHO.

22
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,336
KELLY B.
NEVER DID ANYTHING TO NAY.

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,756
NEVER.

24
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,591
>> STOP!

25
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,968
>> Jeff: OLDER TRIBE
IN COMPLETE DISARRAY.

26
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,261
WHEN THE OLDER TRIBE LOST
YET ANOTHER CHALLENGE...

27
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,973
YOUNGER TRIBE WINS IMMUNITY
AND REWARD!

28
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,934
JIMMY T. NOMINATED HIMSELF
TO BE LEADER.

29
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,436
>> I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL
IN THE PAST,

30
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,645
AND I CAN BE SUCCESSFUL
IN THE FUTURE.

31
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,857
>> HE WANTED TO GET RID OF DAN
AND HOLLY AND JANE AGREED.

32
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,026
>> I THINK THE ONLY PERSON
THAT MIGHT BE IN DANGER

33
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,319
WOULD BE DANNY.

34
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,654
>> Jeff: BUT JIMMY'S POLITICKING
CHALLENGED MARTY'S EGO.

35
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,156
>> I'D LIKE TO TELL MARTY,
YOU PREPPY LITTLE BITCH,

36
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,992
YOU WOULDN'T LAST A MINUTE
IN MY WORLD.

37
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:16,826
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

38
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,161
MARTY LOBBIED HARD
AGAINST JIMMY T.

39
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:23,333
>> THERE IS ZERO TOLERANCE
FOR PARANOIA,

40
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,335
DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR.

41
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,669
>> Jeff: AND IT WORKED.

42
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,171
JIMMY T., THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

43
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,132
NOW HOLLY AND JANE ARE
IN DEEP TROUBLE.

44
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,342
16 ARE LEFT.

45
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,344
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

46
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,641
>> MARTY, WHAT DO YOU
NEED HELP WITH?

47
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,309
>> I THINK WE'RE
JUST LOADING UP THE FIRE,

48
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,854
SOME KIND OF SUBSTANTIAL PIECES.

49
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,860
>> I HAD NO IDEA

50
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,320
THAT JIMMY T. WAS GOING TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

51
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,364
I WAS SHOCKED.

52
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,824
>> JIMMY T.'S A GOOD GUY.

53
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,908
>> HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY.

54
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,034
>> HE'S A GOOD GUY.

55
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,410
I DON'T THINK
HE HAS THE EASIEST LIFE.

56
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,912
I THINK HE'S...

57
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,496
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

58
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,665
I THINK HE WORKS HARD.

59
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,416
MOST OF THE PEOPLE
THAT I TALKED TO

60
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,044
SAID THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE
FOR THE WEAKEST LINK.

61
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,254
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT,
PHYSICALLY,

62
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,549
JIMMY T. COULD DO
HAND STANDS OVER DANNY.

63
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,759
AND THEY'RE KEEPING
THE TRIBE STRONG?

64
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,302
IT DOES UPSET ME.

65
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,055
I'M ON THE OUTS AND I KNOW
THAT SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE.

66
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,456
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL LAST NIGHT
WAS A SLAM DUNK.

67
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,125
JIMMY T. WAS VOTED OFF.

68
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,460
SO YOU CAN'T GET COCKY
IN THIS GAME,

69
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,463
BUT I'M IN CONTROL FINALLY.

70
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,839
I'M IN CONTROL OF THIS TRIBE.

71
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,966
SO WE'RE GOOD, MAN.

72
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,554
WE'RE GOOD FOR MINIMUM TWO
TO THREE MORE TRIBALS.

73
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,265
IF YOU CAN SEE TWO TRIBALS AHEAD
IN THIS GAME,

74
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,433
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD,
AND IF YOU CAN SEE IT

75
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,562
WITH THE LEVEL OF CERTAINTY
THAT I HAVE, EVEN BETTER.

76
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,457
JANE AND HOLLY,
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO.

77
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,793
IT WOULD TAKE SOMETHING
EXTRAORDINARY,

78
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,460
OFF THE CHARTS,

79
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,462
COMPLETELY WHACKED OUT

80
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,423
TO DISTURB MY PLANS NOW.

81
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,142
>> I'M SO PROUD TO BE
ON MY YOUNG TRIBE.

82
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,519
I MEAN, WE'RE THE BOMB.

83
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,354
MY SOLID FIVE RIGHT NOW

84
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,233
IS MYSELF AND PURPLE KELLY,
BRENDA, CHASE, AND SASH.

85
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,403
WE ARE CONTROLLING
THIS ENTIRE GAME RIGHT NOW.

86
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,029
KELLY B. AND ALINA

87
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,073
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE UP
TO GET VOTED OUT.

88
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,244
I HAVE IT ALL PLANNED IN MY
HEAD, I ALREADY SEE THE WIN.

89
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,371
WE GOT THE TARP,
I HAVE THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

90
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,872
GOT MY HAIR DONE,

91
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,042
GOT MY SHOES CLEAN,
GOT THE NEW FIT.

92
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,127
YOU KNOW, I GOT MY SWAG.

93
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,588
IF I LOOK GOOD, I FEEL GOOD,
I'M GOING TO DO GOOD.

94
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,808
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

95
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,439
YOUNGER TRIBE GETTING
YOUR FIRST LOOK

96
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,857
AT THE NEW OLDER TRIBE.

97
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,442
JIMMY T. VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

98
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:21,696
>> MARTY LOOKS ROUGH.

99
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,910
>> Jeff: YOU GUYS READY
TO GET TO IT FOR TODAY?

100
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,911
>> YES.

101
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,038
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

102
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,205
DROP YOUR BUFFS.

103
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,165
>> OH, WOW.

104
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,541
>> Jeff: WE ARE
SWITCHING TRIBES.

105
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:37,045
>> I'M GOING TO CRY RIGHT NOW.

106
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,550
>> Jeff: I SEE A LOT
OF SHOCKED FACES, MARTY.

107
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,635
>> HEY, LISTEN,

108
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,054
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE
IN THIS GAME.

109
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,972
I WAS DEFINITELY
NOT COUNTING ON THIS.

110
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:48,848
NOT NOW. TOO EARLY.

111
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,601
>> Jeff: JUD,
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE

112
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,395
CAPTURED A MOMENT OF SHOCK.

113
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,106
>> OH, MAN,
WE WERE ON SUCH A ROLL.

114
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,566
WE JUST WANTED TO KEEP WINNING

115
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,277
AND NOW EVERYTHING
IS BACK UP IN THE AIR.

116
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,779
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

117
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,364
WE ARE GOING TO DRAW
FOR NEW CAPTAINS.

118
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,788
YOU'RE GOING TO REACH IN
AND TAKE A ROCK.

119
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,831
DON'T LOOK.

120
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,044
JUD DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO DRAW.

121
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,303
AND ONE FOR YOU, JILL.

122
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,600
KEEPING YOUR PALMS CLOSED,

123
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,936
TURN THEM FACE UP.

124
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,604
HERE WE GO, REVEAL.

125
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,108
IF YOU HAVE A YELLOW ROCK,
YOU'RE A CAPTAIN.

126
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,318
IF YOU HAVE A BLUE ROCK,
YOU ARE A CAPTAIN.

127
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,278
BRENDA AND HOLLY
ARE THE CAPTAINS.

128
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,281
TAKE A SPOT RIGHT HERE.

129
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,200
ALL RIGHT, BRENDA,

130
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,285
YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE
THREE PEOPLE

131
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,871
FROM THE OLDER TRIBE
TO JOIN YOU.

132
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,706
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE
ON YOUR TRIBE.

133
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,834
TO EVEN THINGS UP, HOLLY,

134
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,335
YOU'RE GOING TO PICK
FOUR MEMBERS

135
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,421
FROM THE YOUNGER TRIBE
TO JOIN YOU.

136
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,467
YOU DONE?

137
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,347
ALL RIGHT, TAKE A SPOT BACK
ON YOUR TRIBES.

138
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,809
FROM THE OLDER TRIBE,

139
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,395
JOINING THE YOUNGER TRIBE:

140
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,190
JANE, JILL AND MARTY.

141
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,317
FROM THE YOUNGER TRIBE

142
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,735
JOINING THE OLDER TRIBE:

143
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:30,700
ALINA, BENRY, CHASE, AND NAONKA.

144
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,827
SWITCH TRIBES.

145
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,744
>> HEY, GUYS.

146
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,745
>> HEY, EVERYBODY.

147
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,746
>> HI.

148
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,707
>> THANK YOU.

149
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,041
>> BENRY.

150
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,376
>> WELCOME.

151
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,711
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

152
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,504
>> Jeff: HERE ARE
YOUR NEW BUFFS.

153
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,089
YOUNGER TRIBE NO MORE,

154
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,507
YOU ARE NOW LA FLOR.

155
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,550
OLDER TRIBE NO MORE.

156
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,052
YOU ARE NOW ESPADA.

157
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,888
PUT THEM ON.

158
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,431
>> OH, MY GOD, THEY'RE CLEAN.

159
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,267
>> Jeff: OLD VERSUS YOUNG
IS DONE.

160
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,854
MEDALLION OF POWER, DONE.

161
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,939
>> WOW.

162
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,737
>> Jeff: IT IS A BRAND-NEW GAME.

163
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,906
IT IS LA FLOR WEARING YELLOW

164
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,908
VERSUS ESPADA WEARING BLUE.

165
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,077
NAONKA, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF YOUR NEW TRIBE?

166
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,412
>> IT'S KIND OF HARD

167
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,247
BECAUSE I'M AWAY FROM MY FAMILY

168
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:18,915
AND WE GOT REALLY CLOSE

169
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,626
AND I'M GOING TO MISS YOU GUYS.

170
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,921
>> Jeff: MARTY,
STILL EARLY IN THIS GAME.

171
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,589
WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF THIS NEW TRIBE?

172
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,675
>> LISTEN, HOW CAN YOU ARGUE
WITH WINNING, RIGHT?

173
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,801
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN WINNING,
WINNING, WINNING.

174
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,430
IT'S GOING TO FEEL GOOD
TO BE WITH THE WINNING TRIBE

175
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,057
AND I GOT A SNEAKING SUSPICION

176
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,808
THAT CAMP'S GOING
TO BE KIND OF PLUSH.

177
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,311
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

178
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,437
YOU GUYS READY TO GET

179
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,356
TO YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE
AS NEW TRIBES?

180
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:43,981
>> ABSOLUTELY.

181
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:44,774
>> Jeff: IT'S FOR REWARD.

182
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,816
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

183
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,402
TWO MEMBERS OF EACH TRIBE

184
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,489
WILL THROW A BALL
THAT WILL ROLL DOWN A WALL

185
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,116
AND BOUNCE AND CHANGE DIRECTION
ALONG THE WAY.

186
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,744
TWO MEMBERS OF THE OTHER TRIBE

187
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,622
MUST WORK TOGETHER
TO CATCH THOSE BALLS.

188
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,415
IF A BALL HITS THE GROUND,

189
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,417
THE OTHER TRIBE SCORES A POINT.

190
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,169
THAT ROUND IS OVER.

191
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,087
WE BRING IN THE NEXT PAIRS.

192
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,258
FIRST TRIBE TO SCORE THREE
WINS REWARD.

193
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,260
WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?

194
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,552
>> YEAH!

195
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,262
>> OH!

196
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,764
>> OH, BABY, OH, BABY, OH, BABY!

197
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,600
>> Jeff: TWO CHICKENS,
ONE ROOSTER.

198
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,726
WORTH PLAYING FOR?

199
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,978
>> YEAH!

200
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,104
>> WRING THAT NECK
ON THAT CHICKEN!

201
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,524
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GIVE YOU
A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

202
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,567
WE'LL GET STARTED.

203
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,366
HERE WE GO.

204
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,201
FOR REWARD,
WE ARE PLAYING TO THREE.

205
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:37,702
SURVIVORS READY?

206
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,870
GO.

207
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,206
>> GO ESPADA!

208
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,457
>> LET'S GO, GUYS!

209
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,792
>> Jeff: BENRY AND CHASE

210
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,836
MARTY AND SASH FOR LA FLOR.

211
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,796
YOU'VE GOT TO CATCH THESE BALLS.

212
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,798
IF YOU DROP,
THE OTHER TRIBE SCORES.

213
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,800
>> GOT IT, MARTY!

214
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,553
>> Jeff:
MARTY WITH A GREAT GRAB.

215
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,305
>> LET'S GO, CHASE!

216
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,515
>> GET IT!

217
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,684
>> Jeff: SASH DROPS FOR LA FLOR.

218
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,894
ESPADA SCORES FIRST POINT!

219
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,731
NEXT GROUP OUT.

220
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,858

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,706
FABIO AND JILL WORKING TOGETHER.

227
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,874
NICE CATCHES.

228
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,625
>> GREAT JOB, GUYS!

229
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,919
>> Jeff: HOLLY CAN'T GET IT
UP THE WALL,

230
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,422
COSTING HER TRIBE TIME.

231
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:35,676
TYRONE DROPS FOR ESPADA.

232
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,053
LA FLOR SCORES!

233
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,263

GET THEM!

242
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,027
GET 'EM!

243
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,737
>> MARTY, GET THAT!

244
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,907
ALL RIGHT!

245
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,200
>> I GOT IT!

246
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,370

247
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,580
ESPADA SCORES AND LEADS 2-1.

248
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,082

251
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,796
ESPADA CAN WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

252
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,923
LA FLOR WOULD LIKE
TO TIE IT UP HERE.

253
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,050
FABIO AND JILL WITH A STRATEGY.

254
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,010
ONE SHORT, ONE DEEP.

255
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,389
TYRONE WITH A GOOD CATCH.

256
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,765
ALINA WITH A GOOD CATCH.

257
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,891
JILL WITH A NICE GRAB.

258
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,226
TYRONE WITH ANOTHER ONE.

259
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,938
GOT A GREAT RALLY GOING.

260
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,273
>> FABIO, JILL, YOU GUYS GOT IT.

261
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:31,899
>> Jeff: FABIO WITH A CATCH.

262
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,819
ALINA DROPS FOR ESPADA.

263
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,445
WE ARE TIED.

264
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,613
2-2.

265
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,656
WE ARE PLAYING TO THREE.

266
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,699
YOU CAN'T ASK FOR BETTER
THAN THIS.

267
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,618
FIRST CHALLENGE AS NEW TRIBES,

268
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,370
AND IT'S GOING ALL THE WAY.

269
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,746
SURVIVORS READY?

270
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,540
GO!

271
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,958
THE WINNER OF THIS POINT,

272
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,836
TWO CHICKENS, ONE ROOSTER

273
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,465
AND A BIG MESSAGE
TO THE OTHER TRIBE.

274
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,967
>> PERFECT!

275
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,135
PERFECT, NAY!

276
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,469
>> MOVE IN.

277
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,555
I GOT THIS SIDE.

278
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,143
>> COME ON, MARTY!

279
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,352
>> GOT IT, MARTY?

280
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,397
>> Jeff: OH,
MARTY WITH A NICE SAVE!

281
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,860
>> OH!

282
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:21,991
>> GO, GET IT!

283
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,826
>> Jeff: MARTY DROPS
FOR LA FLOR.

284
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,871
ESPADA WINS REWARD!

285
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,046
>> THAT WAS GOOD!

286
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,881
>> THAT WAS SO GOOD!

287
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,675
>> Jeff: ESPADA,
CONGRATULATIONS.

288
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,677
COME GET YOUR REWARD.

289
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,973
>> ALL RIGHT.

290
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:46,974
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

291
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:47,975
>> BYE, FAM.

292
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,644
>> GOOD JOB.

293
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,480
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LA FLOR,
GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

294
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,482
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

295
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,408
>> WELCOME HOME, ESPADA!

296
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,204
>> GOOD JOB, WELCOME, MAN!

297
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,040
TODAY WE GOT NEW PEOPLE
IN THE TRIBE.

298
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,043
>> BENRY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

299
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,586
>> IF I HAD IT MY WAY,

300
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,379
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO STAY
WITH THE OLD TRIBE

301
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,923
BECAUSE I THINK WE HAD
A GOOD LITTLE MACHINE GOING.

302
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,051
BUT ANOTHER DYNAMIC

303
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,928
IS THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE
PRETTY GIRLS RUNNING AROUND

304
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,014
AND THERE MAY BE
SOME FLIRTATION GOING ON.

305
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,391
>> WE GOT SOME CHICKENS.

306
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,267
>> OH, YEAH.

307
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,729
>> SURE, WE GOT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

308
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,064
I SAY WE KEEP THE CHICKEN ALIVE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE

309
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,525
BECAUSE THAT'S GOING
TO PRODUCE EGGS.

310
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,026
I DON'T KNOW THE RATE
THEY PRODUCE EGGS.

311
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,738
SIT DOWN, TAKE A LOAD OFF,
RELAX, GUYS.

312
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,615
WE GOT ALL DAY.

313
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,951
I THINK WE GOT
A PRETTY GOOD SYSTEM.

314
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,161
THE MACHETE, WE TRY TO KEEP
THE MACHETE RIGHT THERE

315
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,079
SO IF ANYBODY'S LOOKING FOR IT

316
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,581
AND IF ANYBODY TAKES IT
JUST YELL OUT

317
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,458
BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE
MIGHT BE LOOKING.

318
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,043
HERE'S ANOTHER THING,
WHEN YOU LEAVE,

319
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,628
COME BACK WITH A PIECE OF WOOD.

320
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,089
THAT WAY IT'S ORGANIZED,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

321
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,091
>> TYRONE IS DEFINITELY
THE LEADER OF THIS TRIBE,

322
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,094
AND AS SOON AS WE CAME IN HERE
HE STARTED TELLING US

323
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,679
THIS GOES HERE
AND THIS GOES HERE

324
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,722
AND YOU'VE GOT TO DO THIS
AND YOU GOT TO DO THAT.

325
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,933
AND IT'S VERY OLDER TRIBE.

326
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,227
>> WE TRY TO KEEP STUFF
AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE.

327
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,228
IF WE EAT SOMETHING,

328
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,605
WE TRY TO CLEAN THE BOWL OUT,
RINSE IT OUT.

329
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,149
>> IN LA FLOR WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY RULES

330
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,653
AND I THINK THAT NOW YOU
GOT TYRONE RIGHT NOW, TYRONE...

331
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,572
HE'S TRYING TO TELL EVERYBODY
WHAT TO DO.

332
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,073
>> WE'LL DO WHAT
WE'VE BEEN DOING.

333
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,116
DON'T CHANGE NOTHING,
PRETTY MUCH.

334
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,493
>> DON'T THINK YOU A G.--

335
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,369
WHICH IS A GANGSTER--
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

336
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:34,456
>> YOU TWO REMIND ME OF MY SON,
OUR SON.

337
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,917
AND YOU REMIND ME
OF MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER.

338
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:37,960
SO I WAS LIKE, OKAY.

339
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,044
>> PERFECT.

340
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,129
>> WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

341
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,130
>> SOUTH DAKOTA.

342
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,298
>> OH, WOW.

343
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,465
>> GOOD HUNTING THERE.

344
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,134
>> YEAH, THERE'S VERY
GOOD HUNTING.

345
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,303
THIS SWITCH
HAD BEEN PHENOMENAL FOR ME.

346
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,430
I FEEL LIKE I RELATE
TO THE KIDS WELL.

347
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,056
COMING BACK, THE KIDS
WERE VERY RECEPTIVE TO ME,

348
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,561
SO JUST HOPE THAT I CAN
SOME WAY OR ANOTHER

349
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,939
KEEP THEM AND TELL THEM
THAT I'M HONEST TO THEM.

350
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,107
>> I LOVE YOUR ENERGY.

351
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,317
>> YEAH?

352
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,443
I KNOW I...

353
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,944
THAT'S WHAT MY KIDS
ALWAYS SAY, TOO.

354
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,988
THEY'RE LIKE "MOM, YOU CAN DO
THING THINGS WITH US."

355
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,280
>> YOU'RE UPBEAT.

356
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,325
>> GOOD.

357
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,161
I FEEL A CONNECTION WITH BOTH
OF YOU GUYS,

358
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,162
SO THAT'S GOOD, GOOD.

359
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,205
>> THAT'S GOOD.

360
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,206
>> I THINK I HAVE
A BETTER CHANCE

361
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,127
AT GOING FARTHER AT THIS POINT
WITH THE KIDS

362
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,964
THAN I DO WITH DAN,
EVE AND TD.

363
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,467
SO, STRATEGICALLY,

364
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,344
IF THE KIDS COME TO ME
WITH AN IDEA,

365
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,137
100% I'M ONBOARD.

366
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,723
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS FEEL.

367
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,141
HOW DID YOU GUYS GO OVER THERE?

368
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,352
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'VE LOST ANYTHING LEAVING.

369
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,020
>> PERFECT.

370
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:38,937
>> I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

371
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,856
>> I DIDN'T EITHER
BECAUSE I WAS WITH JANE

372
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,983
AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
I WAS IN WITH EVERYBODY ELSE

373
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:43,859
AND THEY WERE...

374
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,486
AND IT CAME OUT
IN THE VOTE LAST NIGHT.

375
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,029
>> YOU LOST JANE
AND YOU GAINED US.

376
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,030
>> THAT'S TRUE.

377
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,281
>> SO THAT'S NUMBERS.

378
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,868
>> THERE'S ONLY FOUR OF US HERE
WITH FOUR OF ESPADA.

379
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,703
>> LET'S HANG TOGETHER,
GUYS, OKAY?

380
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,704
>> YEAH.

381
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,872
>> THANKS.

382
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,916
>> AND HOLLY WANTS
TO TEAM UP WITH US.

383
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,292
WE'LL HAVE THE NUMBERS TO FIVE.

384
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,336
I'M GOING TO GO WHEREVER
THE NUMBERS GO.

385
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,588
IT'S PRETTY IRONIC

386
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,050
THAT ALINA AND MYSELF
GOT PULLED OVER TO ESPADA.

387
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,096
ALINA AND I'S RELATIONSHIP
HAS CHANGED A WHOLE BUNCH.

388
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,223
SO THIS IS OUR HOME NOW

389
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,142
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE DO
WITH WHAT WE HAVE.

390
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,319
>> HAPPY TO HAVE YOU OVER HERE.

391
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,278
>> WE HAVE ROOM FOR EVERYONE.

392
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,738
>> THIS IS SO EXCITING.

393
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,823
>> THE OLD SWITCHEROO.

394
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:34,076
I WAS PRETTY STOKED ON HOW
IT WORKED OUT, ACTUALLY.

395
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,619
I WAS DREADING THE SWITC

396
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,330
H BECAUSE I FELT COMFORTABLE
IN THE ORIGINAL LA FLOR TRIBE.

397
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,583
BUT THE WAY IT WORKED OUT
WAS PRETTY RIGHT ON.

398
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,210
WE PICKED UP MARTY,
JILL AND JANE.

399
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,587
WE'RE ALL SUPER COOL

400
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,758
AND NUMBERS WISE LA FLOR TRIBE
ARE 5-3, IT LOOKS GOOD.

401
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,428
>> IT WILL BE GOOD TO FIND OUT
HOW YOU GUYS DO STUFF

402
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,138
SO WE DON'T STEP
ON PEOPLE'S TOES.

403
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,932
WE HAD PROTOCOL
FOR WHO TOOK CARE OF FIRE

404
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,308
AND WATER
AND HOW WE DID THAT STUFF SO...

405
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,102
>> WE HAVE TO WORK IN THIS CAMP.

406
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,521
NO ONE EVER SAT DOWN.

407
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,939
UP 5:30 A.M.

408
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:04,440
>> NO SLACKERS AT ALL.

409
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,651
SO YOU GUYS, LIKE,

410
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,945
GATHER FIREWOOD AS A TEAM SORT
OF EVERYDAY OR...

411
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,950
>> LAID BACK;
WE DON'T LIKE TROUBLE.

412
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,327
>> WELL, I LIKE THESE KIDS.

413
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,997
I MEAN, THEY KIND OF THINK
LIKE ME,

414
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,999
AND THEY SEEM TO BE
MORE RELAXED,

415
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,669
WHEREAS MY TRIBE WAS ALL ABOUT
SCHEDULE, SCHEDULE, SCHEDULE.

416
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,304
>> THEY SIT AROUND
AND CHATTERBOX AND HAVE TEA.

417
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,766
I WOULD HAVE VOTED MARTY
AND JILL OUT A LONG TIME AGO

418
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,808
IF I COULD HAVE GOT AN ALLIANCE

419
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,268
BECAUSE MARTY AND JILL
HAVE BEEN TIGHT AS TICKS.

420
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,646
ONE HUMPING THE OTHER ONE
ON THE BACK.

421
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,939
I'M TELLING YOU.

422
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,692
>> I WAS GUESSING YOU GUYS HAVE
HAD A SHOT AT IMMUNITY IDOLS.

423
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,487
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

424
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,321
IT WAS IN THE FRUIT BASKET.

425
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,782
WE GOT IN HERE,

426
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,159
WE WERE ALL EXCITED
AND THEN NAONKA SHOVES KELLY B.

427
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,328
AND JUST GOES FOR THE CLUE

428
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:03,123
AND GETS IT AND THEN WALKS
DOWN HERE TO READ IT.

429
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,666
>> SHE DIDN'T SHARE IT
WITH EVERYBODY?

430
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,834
>> NO.

431
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,004
>> I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN KIND OF SIN

432
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,173
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER FORGIVE,
YOU KNOW?

433
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:11,715
TO HAVE SOMEBODY...

434
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,175
>> I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

435
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,385
WE'RE THE YOUNG TRIBE.

436
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,513
I GUESS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

437
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,806
I DON'T KNOW.

438
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,225
>> IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME
LIKE THIS TRIBE

439
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,519
HAS HAD A LOT OF LEADERSHIP

440
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,395
AND, FRANKLY, AT ESPADA,

441
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,856
I GOT CONTROL
OF THAT ENTIRE TRIBE

442
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,526
AND NOT NECESSARILY BY BEING
A LEADER BUT BY BEING A PLAYER.

443
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,238
FABIO JUST TOLD ME THAT SOMEBODY
JUST PUSHED SOMEBODY ASIDE,

444
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,865
RAN OFF WITH THE CLUE
TO THE IDOL

445
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,700
AND YOU GUYS LET THAT FLY.

446
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,244
COME ON, GUYS.

447
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,704
THAT WOULD BE, LIKE,
CANCER IN A TRIBE.

448
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,413
>> WE HAD SERIOUS ISSUES,
LIKE...

449
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,791
>> I'M GOING TO TELL YOU GUYS

450
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,377
THE WAY I PLAYED THE GAME
AND JILL WILL SAY THE SAME, TOO.

451
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,712
I HAVEN'T HAD TO LIE TO ANYBODY,

452
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,173
DO ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN
BACK STABBING

453
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,884
SO I WANT TO GET OFF
ON THE RIGHT FOOT WITH YOU GUYS.

454
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,511
I HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

455
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,263
>> YEAH?

456
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,264
>> THERE YOU GO.

457
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,390
>> WHOA!

458
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,391
THAT'S AWESOME.

459
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,433
>> RIGHT ON.

460
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,685
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY
IMPORTANT

461
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,727
TO SHOW I HAD THE IDOL.

462
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,397
I KNEW THAT JANE WOULD PROBABLY
TELL THEM I HAD IT

463
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,109
SO WHY NOT PLAY IT UP FRONT

464
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,777
AND TRY TO GET SOMETHING
OUT OF IT.

465
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,737
WE SHARED THE CLUE,
EVERYBODY READ IT.

466
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,280
THAT'S WHY I'M SURPRISED
YOU GUYS...

467
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,407
>> OKAY, OH, OKAY.

468
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,741
>> IF ONE PERSON HAD TAKEN
THE CLUE,

469
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,076
I DON'T KNOW,
I WOULD HAVE TACKLED THEM.

470
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:21,535
I WOULD HAVE CLUBBED THEM
OVER THE HEAD.

471
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,287
>> I WANTED TO.

472
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,747
>> I THINK MARTY IS SO ARROGANT.

473
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,250
HE JUST WHIPPED OUT
THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

474
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,919
YOU KNOW, "OKAY, NO B.S.,

475
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,379
I HAVE THE IDOL."

476
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,424
AND WE'RE SITTING THERE, LIKE,
WOW, SO IMPRESSED!

477
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,261
BUT IN OUR HEADS WE'RE LIKE,
ARE YOU STUPID?

478
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,804
HE'S COMING INTO OUR HOME,

479
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,223
AND HE'S ALREADY SETTING UP
LIKE HE'S THE KING.

480
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,266
>> WOW!

481
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,434
>> IS THAT A KEY?

482
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,810
>> HE HAS A LOT OF BALLS.

483
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,146
THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING
HE COULD HAVE DONE.

484
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,314
HELLO?

485
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,328
>> EVERY TIME YOU THINK
DAYS CAN'T GET WORSE HERE,

486
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,623
THEY GET WORSE.

487
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,917
CAN'T EVEN GET THE HEAT
FROM THE FIRE WITH THESE WINDS.

488
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,127
>> WE NEED TO GET SOME WOOD
IN THERE NOW.

489
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,006
>> THE RESOURCES
AROUND THIS CAMP

490
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,341
ARE DEFINITELY SLIM.

491
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,593
THEY BUILT THAT SHELTER
RIGHT OFF THE OCEAN.

492
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,469
WE'RE GETTING A CRAZY WIND.

493
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,930
THEY'VE GOT A HIGH ROOF

494
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,849
AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE
OF RAIN HERE TODAY.

495
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,975
AND, YOU KNOW,

496
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,519
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THERE'S ANY SIGN OF STOPPING.

497
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,818
>> RAIN'S GONNA STOP.

498
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,862
IT'S GOT TO STOP EVENTUALLY.

499
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,493
>> HANG IN THERE, BABY,
IT'S GOING TO BLOW OVER.

500
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,497
>> THIS RAIN OUT HERE
IS HIDEOUS.

501
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,207
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE RAIN

502
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,209
AND I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT,
LIKE, MY HEAD.

503
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,377
BECAUSE WHEN I'M COLD

504
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,880
AND I'M NOT REALLY DOING
TOO WELL I LOSE IT.

505
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,015
THIS WEATHER IS THE WORST.

506
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,935
IT'S KILLING ME.

507
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,312
I'M HURTING.

508
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,314
LIKE REALLY BAD.

509
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:28,620
>> I KNOW.

510
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,872
>> YOU KNOW IT DEEP DOWN.

511
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,251
NAONKA SEEMS LIKE
A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL.

512
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,336
SHE'S IRRATIONAL AND CRAZY

513
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,215
AND SHE JUST SEEMS LIKE SHE'S
ON HER PERIOD ALL THE TIME.

514
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,175
RAIN IS NOT THAT BIG
OF A DEAL HERE.

515
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:42,676
WE'RE ON A BEACH.

516
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,386
WE'RE WET ANYWAY.

517
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,929
I MEAN, WHO CARES.

518
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,098
BUT I'M ACTUALLY,
LIKE, RELISHING IN IT.

519
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,850
JUST KEEP CHECKING OUT.

520
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,352
IT'S BETTER FOR ME
IF YOU WANT TO GO HOME

521
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,563
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST ONE LESS
PERSON I HAVE TO BATTLE AGAINST.

522
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,608
>> I'M GLAD SHE CHOSE US
BUT I'M, LIKE, DAMN.

523
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,401
>> I KNOW, WE COULD BE
UNDER A TARP.

524
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,570
I KEEP THINKING THE SAME THING.

525
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,239
>> WE WORKED SO HARD TO GET IT,

526
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,116
AND IT WAS JUST STRIPPED
FROM US.

527
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,411
>> BECAUSE IT'S WET
AND I HAVE NO CLOTHES.

528
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,415
>> YOU HAVE THE REST OF YOUR
LIFE TO BE WARM AND COMFORTABLE.

529
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:13,665
>> I KNOW.

530
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,417
GOD.

531
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,087
OH, I JUST WANT THIS TO STOP.

532
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,133
>> I'M SCARED.

533
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,384
>> YOU'RE SCARED OF WHAT?

534
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,094
>> I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

535
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,471
>> YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT,
TRUST US.

536
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,598
YOU WERE TRYING
TO CONVINCE HER NOT TO.

537
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,683
COME HERE.

538
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,519
HEY, SERIOUSLY.

539
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,702
>> THIS IS A LITTLE STORM
RIGHT HERE.

540
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,955
IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

541
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,956
>> YES.

542
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,291
>> THE DAY THAT MY DAD DIED,

543
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,126
I WAS DRIVING HOME,

544
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,380
IT WAS RAINING
THE WHOLE DRIVE AND...

545
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,466
I SWEAR I LOOKED IN
MY REAR-VIEW MIRROR

546
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,468
AND THEN THE DAMN BACK
OF MY TRUCK...

547
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,804
LIKE IN THE BED OF MY TRUCK,

548
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,139
IT LOOKED LIKE A RAINBOW
WAS RIGHT THERE.

549
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,684
AND THEN I TURNED AROUND,
AND I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

550
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,446
WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

551
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,447
WE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH.

552
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,449
THIS AIN'T NOTHING.

553
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,621
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

554
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,383
MARTY, HAD A FEW DAYS
WITH YOUR NEW TRIBE.

555
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,260
FEELING CAMARADERIE?

556
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,219
>> IT'S EASY TO FEEL CAMARADERIE

557
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,597
WHEN YOU HERE
IN THE TAJ MAHAL OF CAMPS.

558
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,557
>> Jeff: SO, JANE,
LIFE GOT A LOT BETTER FOR YOU

559
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,766
WITH THE SWITCH.

560
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,394
>> OH, YEAH, HONEY.

561
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,062
BEING DRY WAS GREAT.

562
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,565
>> Jeff: ALINA,
OPPOSITE FOR YOU?

563
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,400
DID YOU GO FROM GOOD TO BAD?

564
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,902
>> I WOULDN'T SAY WE WENT
TO BAD,

565
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,112
BUT WE BONDED IN A DIFFERENT WAY

566
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,573
AND IT'S BECAUSE WE WERE WET
INSTEAD OF DRY.

567
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,782
>> Jeff: GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S CHALLENGE?

568
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,242
>> YES.

569
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,244
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
I'LL TAKE BACK IMMUNITY.

570
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,124
ONCE AGAIN,

571
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,418
IMMUNITY IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

572
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,086
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

573
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,588
THREE MEMBERS OF EACH TRIBE

574
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,924
WILL BE STRAPPED
TO A LARGE WHEEL.

575
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,760
THREE OTHER TRIBE MEMBERS
WILL SPIN THE WHEEL,

576
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,221
TEMPORARILY CAUSING
THEIR TRIBE MATES

577
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:14,721
TO GO UNDERWATER.

578
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,265
WHILE SUBMERGED,

579
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,767
YOU'LL TRY TO TAKE
IN A MOUTHFUL OF WATER

580
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,562
THAT YOU WILL THEN SPIT
INTO A SMALL BOWL

581
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,105
WHICH FEEDS A TUBE.

582
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,899
ONCE THE TUBE FILLS UP,

583
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,484
A BALL WILL BE RELEASED.

584
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,276
THE TWO REMAINING TRIBE MEMBERS

585
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,403
WILL USE THE BALL
TO BREAK TILES.

586
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,115
FIRST TRIBE TO BREAK
ALL FIVE TILES WINS IMMUNITY,

587
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,992
IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE,

588
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,118
LOSERS GO TO TRIBE COUNCIL

589
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,830
WHERE THE FIFTH PERSON
WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

590
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,415
I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE
TO STRATEGIZE.

591
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,417
WE'LL GET STARTED.

592
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,841
>> Jeff: ON THE WHEEL
FOR LA FLOR,

593
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,135
WE HAVE KELLY B.,

594
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,221

596
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,476
WE HAVE ALINA, HOLLY, AND YVE.

597
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,811
SURVIVORS READY?

598
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,521
GO.

599
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,606
>> LET'S GO, ESPADA.

600
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,108
>> Jeff: GOING UNDERWATER TRYING

601
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,151
TO TAKE IN WATER
AND THEN SPIT IT OUT.

602
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,778
HOLLY GETS A LITTLE IN.

603
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,446
BRENDA GETS A LITTLE IN.

604
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,616
THERE'S DEFINITELY
A LEARNING CURVE

605
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,826
TO THIS CHALLENGE.

606
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,202

616
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,850
>> SLOW DOWN A LITTLE.

617
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,352
>> Jeff: ESPADA REALLY
SLOWING DOWN.

618
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,398
LA FLOR'S MOVING TWICE
AS FAST AS ESPADA.

619
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,694
>> GET IN THERE, ALINA.

620
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,862
GOOD JOB!

621
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,196

00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:04,831
TRYING A DIFFERENT STRATEGY

628
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,375
AND IT'S WORKING.

629
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,544
LA FLOR SPINNING FAST

630
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,879
BUT THEY'RE MISSING THEIR BOWL.

631
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,838
>> SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT!

632
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,174
>> SLOW US DOWN!

633
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,342

FROM YOUR TRIBE.

702
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,185
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

703
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,854
ESPADA, NEW TRIBE, SAME RESULT.

704
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,064
TRIBAL COUNCIL
ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT.

705
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,692
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

706
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,985
I WILL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

707
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:39,861
>> I KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING
TO LOSE.

708
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,987
I FELT IT.

709
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,406
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A QUITTER

710
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,992
AND I DON'T WANT MY STUDENTS
TO THINK I'M A QUITTER BUT...

711
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,912
I'M JUST GETTING SKINNIER

712
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,080
AND I'M LOSING FAT
AND I THINK I'M DONE.

713
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,082
I REALLY DO THINK I'M DONE.

714
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,140
>> WE LOST THE CHALLENGE TODAY

715
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,060
AND I BELIEVE THAT ESPADA
IS CURSED

716
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,979
BECAUSE HOW YOU GONNA GET
THE PICK OF THE LITTER

717
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,397
AND YOU'RE STILL LOSING?

718
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,192
WE'RE GOING
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

719
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,237
IT'S CRAZY BUT I'M NOT NERVOUS
AT ALL ABOUT TRIBAL.

720
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,696
I MADE IT THIS FAR.

721
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,865
IF I CONTINUE GOING,
KUDOS TO ME.

722
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,908
BUT I DON'T CARE.

723
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,076
I REALLY WANT TO GO HOME.

724
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,285
I'M OVER IT.

725
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,579
>> I WANT TO EAT BEFORE TRIBAL.

726
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,581
>> BUT WHAT DO WE HAVE TO EAT?

727
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,923
>> I WANT TO EAT ONE
OF THOSE MOTHERS.

728
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,552
>> WHAT DO YOU DO BREAK THE NECK
OR CUT ITS HEAD OFF?

729
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:49,222
>> WE'RE THINKING WE NEED
TO BREAK IT.

730
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:53,309
>> WE'RE GONNA BREAK
THIS CHICKEN'S NECK.

731
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,479
>> THAT'S CONSENSUS?

732
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,939
ARE WE GOING WITH THAT?

733
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,233
I MEAN, IF THAT'S WHAT
Y'ALL WANT TO DO.

734
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,401
I DISAGREE WITH IT, BUT...

735
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,735
>> YOU DO?

736
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,112
>> YEAHM BECAUSE I THINK
WE'RE CUTTING DOWN

737
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,446
OUR EGG PRODUCTION.

738
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,073
>> ONE EGG A DAY, THOUGH.

739
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,575
>> THAT'S JUST MY TAKE ON IT.

740
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,327
>> IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERYBODY WANTED

741
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,955
TO EAT THE CHICKEN
EXCEPT FOR TYRONE.

742
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,958
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT IS HARD
TO GO AGAINST TYRONE.

743
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,418
TYRONE IS A LITTLE INTIMIDATING,

744
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,796
BUT I THINK WE NEED
TO START STANDING UP TO TYRONE.

745
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,798
>> I'M THINKING KEEP IT.

746
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,469
>> WE CAN VOTE ON IT,
THAT'S ALL.

747
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:35,476
>> I'M DOWN TO KILLING
AND EAT ONE TODAY.

748
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,477
>> KILL.

749
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,979
KILL IT.

750
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,314
>> IF I HAD IT MY WAY

751
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,857
I SAY WE KEEP THE CHICKEN

752
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,984
BUT WE'RE GOING TO KILL ONE
FOR IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION

753
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,152
AND AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING
TO BE HUNGRY AGAIN.

754
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,780
BUT I'M NOT GOING AGAINST IT

755
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,824
AND JUST SAY "NO,
THAT AIN'T HAPPENING."

756
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:53,036
IT WOULDN'T BE SMART TO ROCK
THE BOAT RIGHT NOW.

757
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,674
>> WHOO!

758
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,594
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

759
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,477
>> I NOTICED AS WE WERE CLEANING
THE CHICKEN

760
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,228
AND AS WE WERE BOILING
THE CHICKEN,

761
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,564
TYRONE, HE STAYED
IN THE BACKGROUND

762
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,148
BECAUSE IT WASN'T HIS WAY,

763
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,359
INSTEAD OF PITCHING IN.

764
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,319
BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS TIME
TO EAT THE CHICKEN,

765
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,905
HE WAS RIGHT THERE.

766
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,366
OH, DOES THAT LOOK GOOD.

767
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,202
>> THAT LOOKS PRETTY DELICIOUS.

768
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,536
>> JUST HAVE EVERYBODY
TAKE SOME.

769
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,538
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

770
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,849
>> WE HAD PLENTY OF FOOD
FOR EVERYBODY

771
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,103
AND EVERYBODY TOOK
A MEDIOCRE REGULAR SIZE PORTION.

772
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,271
MEANWHILE YOU HAVE TYRONE
IN THE CORNER

773
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,650
JUST FEASTING AND IT WAS
VERY BLATANTLY OBVIOUS

774
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,777
THAT HE HAD GOTTEN MORE CHICKEN

775
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,070
THAN THE REST OF THE TRIBE

776
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:14,033
SO HE'S BECOMING MORE
AND MORE OBNOXIOUS BY THE DAY.

777
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,917
>> BUT LOOK OUT
FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR.

778
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,420
LOOK OUT FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR.

779
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,797
>> TYRONE'S, YOU KNOW,

780
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,590
GRANTED,
HE'S A VERY PHYSICAL PLAYER

781
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,260
AND HE COULD BENEFIT US IN SOME
CHALLENGES

782
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,720
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

783
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,930
BUT HE'S NOT THE EASIEST GUY

784
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,098
TO BE ON THE SAME TRIBE WITH

785
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,726
SO I THINK THAT CUTTING HIM
LOOSE TONIGHT

786
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,269
WOULD ABSOLUTELY BRING US
CLOSER TOGETHER,

787
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,605
BUT IT WORRIES ME A BIT.

788
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,942
NAONKA IS HANGING ON
BY A THREAD.

789
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,652
SHE'S STRUGGLING.

790
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,612
SHE ALMOST THREW
THE RED FLAG LAST NIGHT,

791
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,781
AND SHE'S NOT DOING TOO WELL.

792
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,285
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S ALL THERE
MENTALLY RIGHT NOW.

793
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,119
>> WHAT'S THE SENTIMENT
ON YOUR SIDE?

794
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,288
>> NAY'S NOT IN THIS MENTALLY.

795
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,124
>> FOR SOMEONE
WHO OBVIOUSLY KNOWS

796
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,169
THAT SHE'S, LIKE,
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK,

797
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,337
SHE'S NOT REALLY POLITICKING
A LOT.

798
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,466
SO SHE MIGHT BE KIND OF,
LIKE, LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

799
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,383
AS OF NOW THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE KIND OF THINKING

800
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,927
BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP
THE TRIBE STRONG.

801
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,304
>> I WANT TO KEEP
THE TRIBE STRONG.

802
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,139
>> EVERYONE AT CAMP IS AWARE

803
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,808
THAT NAONKA HAS HAD
A ROUGH COUPLE DAYS.

804
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,643
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BIG DEAL.

805
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,436
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO SEND NAY HOME.

806
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,813
WE SHOULD BE HAPPY
WE HAVE HOLLY.

807
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,859
MYSELF, CHASE, BENRY AND HOLLY,

808
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,570
WE'RE DEFINITELY IN CONTROL
OF THIS GAME

809
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,781
SO WE HAVE TO DO DECIDE
WHO GOES HOME,

810
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,991
TYRONE OR NAONKA.

811
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,035
I MEAN, I'M JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO SEE

812
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,078
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS TO DO.

813
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,972
>> Jeff: ALINA.

814
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,517
BEEN TOGETHER
WITH THIS NEW TRIBE THREE DAYS.

815
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,851
TELL ME ABOUT THE DYNAMICS.

816
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,186
HOW'S EVERYBODY GETTING ALONG?

817
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,854
>> UM, COMING TOGETHER,

818
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,898
IT WAS NICE AT THE BEGINNING,
OBVIOUSLY.

819
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,025
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

820
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,401
THE OLD LA FLOR TRIBE,

821
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,694
WE LIVED THE WAY WE LIVED,

822
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,529
WE HAD THE WAY WE DID THINGS,

823
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,490
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF TURF WARS.

824
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,034
NOW THAT WE'RE ON ESPADA'S TURF,

825
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:22,161
WE KIND OF HAVE TO GO
WITH THEIR RULES.

826
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,871
>> Jeff: BENRY, TELL ME
ABOUT LEADERSHIP.

827
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,915
YOU'VE GOT FOUR PEOPLE
FROM THE YOUNG TRIBE,

828
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,374
FOUR PEOPLE
FROM THE OLDER TRIBE.

829
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,501
>> YEAH.

830
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:32,046
TYRONE SEEMS TO BE THE BOSS MAN
AROUND ESPADA.

831
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:33,548
HE'S GOT AN ASSERTIVE
PERSONALITY,

832
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,383
A LOUD VOICE,
AND WHAT HE SAYS USUALLY GOES.

833
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,677
>> Jeff: TYRONE?

834
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,178
>> SIR?

835
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,346
>> Jeff: WHAT COMES WITH BEING
THE LEADER OF THIS TRIBE?

836
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,015
>> IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY

837
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,892
BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK TO YOU
FOR ANSWERS,

838
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,727
INSIGHT AND WISDOM SO TO SPEAK.

839
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,104
>> Jeff: DO YOU FEEL QUALIFIED?

840
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,397
>> YEAH, I DEFINITELY
FEEL QUALIFIED

841
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,357
TO BE A LEADER OF THIS TRIBE.

842
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,401
>> Jeff: ARE YOU HAPPY
BEING THE LEADER?

843
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,404
>> YEAH, I EMBRACE THE POSITION.

844
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,031
BASICALLY WHEN I LEAD,
I TAKE INPUT FROM OTHERS.

845
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,241
I DON'T MAKE
UNILATERAL DECISIONS,

846
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:04,912
SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT ALINA
SAID THERE WERE TURF WARS.

847
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,913
MAYBE WE CAN ADDRESS THEM

848
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,416
BECAUSE I WANT IT TO BE
AS SMOOTH AS IT CAN BE

849
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,918
FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED.

850
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,753
>> Jeff: WELL, NOW'S A GOOD TIME
TO ADDRESS THEM.

851
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,755
ALINA, YOU WANT TO SHARE
WITH TYRONE

852
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,965
WHAT TURF WARS
YOU'RE REFERRING TO?

853
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:19,552
>> JUST WHEN WE CAME INTO CAMP,
IT WAS REALLY LIKE A SPEECH.

854
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,013
LIKE THIS IS HOW THIS GOES.

855
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,973
WE'VE BEEN SURVIVING, TOO.

856
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,058
>> Jeff: SO YOU FELT
A LITTLE LIKE A CHILD?

857
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,476
>> A LITTLE BIT LIKE A CHILD.

858
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,436
>> JEFF, I JUST WANT
TO INTERJECT,

859
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,772
I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY DID IT
AT LA FLOR,

860
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,066
BUT ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO
WAS INTRODUCE THEM.

861
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,775
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT

862
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,777
IF I WAS LAYING DOWN THE LAW.

863
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,446
SO THAT WASN'T MY INTENT,

864
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,114
IF IT WAS RECEIVED THAT WAY.

865
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:42,074
I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S
THE GENERATION GAP, YOU KNOW.

866
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,618
SO I DON'T KNOW.

867
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:47,246
>> Jeff: ALINA, WHAT'S BEEN THE
TOUGHEST DAY OUT HERE SO FAR?

868
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,790
>> I THINK IT'S THE NIGHTS
THAT ARE TOUGH.

869
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,626
ESPECIALLY LAST TWO NIGHTS.

870
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,835
THEY WERE REALLY RAINY.

871
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,795
EVERYBODY WAS DRENCHED
AND IT WAS COLD.

872
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,964
I THINK THAT'S THE TOUGHEST PART
TO GET THROUGH.

873
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,425
>> Jeff: NAONKA, WHAT HAS BEEN
THE DARKEST STORM FOR YOU?

874
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,594
>> OH, MY GOSH.

875
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,763
ULTIMATELY IT WAS LAST NIGHT.

876
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,181
I WAS FREEZING.

877
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,641
I WAS SHAKING.

878
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,435
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT WAS
GONNA BE THIS DIFFICULT FOR ME.

879
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,603
>> Jeff: COMPARE IT.

880
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,979
WHAT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT THING

881
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,314
YOU'VE DONE IN LIFE
UP UNTIL NOW?

882
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,358
>> GETTING A DIVORCE AT 26, 27.

883
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,027
THAT'S BEEN THE HARDEST THING
FOR ME.

884
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,488
>> Jeff: AND WHAT WAS DIFFICULT
ABOUT THAT?

885
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,490
>> BLAMING MYSELF,

886
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,993
THAT I WAS PROBABLY THE ONE
THAT MESSED IT UP.

887
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,495
AND THAT WAS TOUGH.

888
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,207
AND I COULDN'T SHIELD MYSELF
FROM THAT PARTICULAR STORM.

889
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,042
HERE I HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM

890
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,335
AND I HAVE A SAFETY NET.

891
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,836
AND I DIDN'T HAVE THAT

892
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,047
WHEN I WAS GOING
THROUGH THE DIVORCE.

893
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,882
>> Jeff: THAT'S GOT TO BLOW
YOUR MIND A BIT.

894
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,509
THESE ARE STRANGERS COMPETING
AGAINST YOU

895
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,512
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS

896
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,847
AND YOU RECEIVE MORE LOVE
FROM THEM

897
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,432
THAN YOU DID IN YOUR MOST
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.

898
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,434
>> I SURE DID.

899
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,186
AND IT WAS TOUGH
FOR ME TO OPEN UP AND TELL THEM

900
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,854
BUT THEY HAD A LOT
OF ENCOURAGING WORDS.

901
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,650
>> Jeff: SO IT SOUNDS LIKE
THIS WAS A MONUMENTAL NIGHT.

902
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:01,028
YOU'RE COMPARING IT
TO THE WORST TIME IN YOUR LIFE.

903
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,989
>> I ALMOST WAS READY
TO GIVE UP.

904
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,407
>> Jeff: MEANING YOU WERE
WANTING TO QUIT?

905
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,908
>> I WANTED TO QUIT.

906
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,868
I WANTED TO QUIT
BECAUSE IT GOT THAT TOUGH.

907
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,412
IT WAS NOT 24 HOURS IN THAT DAY,

908
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,539
IT WAS 26 BUT IT FELT LIKE 48.

909
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,416
I WAS AT MY BREAKING POINT
YESTERDAY.

910
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:19,880
>> Jeff: BENRY, WHEN YOU SEE
NAONKA CLEARLY STRUGGLING,

911
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,216
THERE HAS TO BE
A NURTURING PART OF YOU

912
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:22,800
WANTING TO COMFORT HER.

913
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,593
AS A COMPETITOR, SEE YA.

914
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,973
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, EXACTLY?

915
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,891
>> Jeff: I DON'T BELIEVE
YOU DON'T KNOW.

916
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,560
WE'RE HERE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

917
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,228
NOBODY WANTS TO BE VOTED.

918
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,730
THERE'S A WOMAN SAYING "I'LL GO.

919
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,732
NO CHANCE MY NAME
GETS WRITTEN DOWN TONIGHT."

920
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,775
YVE, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

921
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,068
>> I THINK I DO.

922
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,361
>> Jeff: YOU THINK YOU DO?

923
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,362
>> WELL, ALL RIGHT, I DO.

924
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,741
WHEN I SEE NAY
START BREAKING DOWN MENTALLY,

925
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,118
IN MY HEAD I DON'T SEE
LONGEVITY THERE

926
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,202
AND I START QUESTIONING IT,
I DO.

927
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,414
WHY ARE YOU HERE IF YOU'RE
STARTING TO BREAK DOWN?

928
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,623
AM I GOING TO ALIGN WITH YOU

929
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,917
AND A WEEK OR TWO
I JUST SEE IT AGAIN?

930
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,586
I WANT LONGEVITY
WITH THESE PEOPLE,

931
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,962
AND IT DID MAKE ME QUESTION.

932
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,340
>> Jeff: NAONKA,
WHILE YOU WERE BREAKING DOWN,

933
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,427
WERE YOU CONSCIOUS ENOUGH OF THE
GAME AROUND YOU TO THINK,

934
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,512
MAN, THIS IS NOT GOOD RIGHT NOW?

935
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,431
>> WELL, EVERYTHING GETS TRICKY
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

936
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,934
MAYBE THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
THAT ARE ZIPPING THEIR LIP.

937
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,936
MAYBE SOME PEOPLE
ARE JUST KEEPING IT 100,

938
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,229
WHICH IS KEEPING IT REAL.

939
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,189
SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

940
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,440
THERE'S A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE
ON THIS TEAM

941
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:24,445
SO THEY KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP
AND WHEN TO TALK.

942
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,573
>> Jeff: WELL, SOMEBODY'S QUEST
TO OUTLAST ALL THE REST

943
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,076
IS ABOUT TO COME TO AN END.

944
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,452
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

945
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,454
ALINA, YOU'RE UP.

946
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,509
>> THIS IS A GROWN FOLKS GAME
AND AS YOU SAY,

947
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,760
YOU'RE KEEPING IT 100.

948
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,178
I'M GOING TO KEEP IT 100.

949
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,222
PEACE OUT.

950
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:06,654
>> IT'S TIME TO DETHRONE
THE KING OF ESPADA.

951
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,657
BENRY'S HERE, BABY.

952
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,659
MY BAD.

953
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,590
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

954
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,351
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

955
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,811
THE PERSON VOTED OUT
WILL ASKED TO LEAVE

956
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,062
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

957
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,106
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

958
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,818
FIRST VOTE, NAONKA.

959
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,575
TYRONE.

960
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,161
TWO VOTES TYRONE,

961
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,662
ONE VOTE NAONKA.

962
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,999
NAONKA.

963
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,709
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES TYRONE,

964
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,503
TWO VOTES NAONKA.

965
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,671
TYRONE.

966
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,886
TYRONE.

967
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:12,761
FOUR VOTES TYRONE,

968
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,557
TWO VOTES NAONKA.

969
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,852
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT
OF<i> SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA,</i>

970
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,020
TYRONE.

971
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,229
THAT'S FIVE, THAT'S ENOUGH.

972
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,273
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

973
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,699
TYRONE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

974
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,701
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

975
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,799
>> Jeff: WELL, THERE WAS
A LOT OF TALK TONIGHT

976
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,344
ABOUT COMMUNICATING
AND NURTURING.

977
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,596
TYRONE FELT NEITHER.

978
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,597
YOUR FIRST BLIND SIDE.

979
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,765
CONGRATULATIONS.

980
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,099
GRAB YOUR TORCHES,
AND HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

981
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,101
GOOD NIGHT.

982
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,864
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

983
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,828
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON<i> SURVIVOR,</i>

984
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,871
DAN WANTS A BUS TICKET BACK
TO NEW YORK.

985
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,793
>> Jeff: MARTY BREAKS
OUT HIS SECRET WEAPON.

986
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,754
>> I AM A GRAND MASTER IN CHESS.

987
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,507
>> IT DOES MAKE SENSE, MAN.

988
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,093
>> Jeff: AND LOOK OUT,
HERE COMES ANOTHER TWIST.

989
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,846
TRIBAL IMMUNITY IS NOT WHAT
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR TODAY.

990
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,102
>> MY PLAN FOR THIS TRIBE
BY BEING THE LEADER

991
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,437
WAS INITIALLY TO STAY
AS STRONG AS WE COULD.

992
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,689
WE OPERATED ON
A DEMOCRATIC BASIS, BASICALLY,

993
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,275
WHERE EVERYBODY HAD SOME INPUT

994
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,777
AND WHAT HAPPENED
WAS WHEN LA FLOR CAME OVER,

995
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,903
THINGS TURNED AWAY
FROM THE TRIBE ASPECT

996
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,531
AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
THEIR STRATEGY FROM THE JUMP.

997
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,283
SO I'M NOT REAL SURPRISED

998
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,659
BECAUSE IT'S A GAME THAT
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN

999
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,660
AND GUESS WHAT?

1000
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,661
ANYTHING HAPPENED.
