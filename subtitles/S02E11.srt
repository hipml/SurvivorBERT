1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,461
>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,796
Food was scarce, fishing was
tough.

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,089
>> RODGER: Tina, I got a line
hung up.

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,341
>> JEFF: And they were
dangerously low on rice.

5
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,594
>> JERRI: One more meal of rice
is all we have we have left?

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,138
>> TINA: At the most.
>> JEFF: Jerri wanted to team up

7
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,433
with Colby for the reward
challenge, but the tribe

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,892
insisted on drawing names from a
hat.

9
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,311
Ironically, she ended up with
Colby anyway, and they went on

10
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:25,150
to win the event, and spent a
day at the Great Barrier Reef.

11
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,944
>> JERRI: This is basically the
perfect honeymoon without the

12
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,821
sex.
>> JEFF: Nick won the immunity

13
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:33,408
challenge.
>> NICK: Yeah, baby!

14
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,286
>> JEFF: In a departure from
previous tribal councils, Ogakor

15
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,581
voted against one of their own.
>> COLBY: Jerri, Jerri, Jerri,

16
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,292
that knock you keep hearing on
your door-- it's checkout time.

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,586
>> JEFF: And Jerri was booted
from the tribe.

18
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:48,840
Jerri, the tribe has spoken.
Seven people left.

19
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:58,933
Who will be voted out tonight?
>> AMBER: Last night, at tribal

20
00:00:59,017 --> 00:02:18,388
Who will be voted out tonight?
>> AMBER: Last night, at tribal

21
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,350
council, Jerri got voted off.
And I think that the group

22
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,270
definitely isolated me from
their decision because they

23
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,896
thought that I was too close to
Jerri.

24
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,276
And I felt sad, not only because
of Jerri leaving, but I think

25
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,280
more so because it made me feel
like my own tribe members didn't

26
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,491
even trust me enough to let me
know what was going on.

27
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,451
I felt really left out, and I
hated that feeling.

28
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:46,082
Good morning.
>> KEITH: I think Amber made a

29
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:49,210
tactical mistake by staying
tight with Jerri.

30
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:53,590
But she was visibly stunned last
night that that took place, too.

31
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,594
She didn't see it coming, so she
probably felt she lost her big

32
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,890
sister comrade last night, and
she's kind of a lone lamb out in

33
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:06,269
the midst of the rest of us now.
And she's a big girl, you know?

34
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,064
She made that decision early on,
and that's where she sits now.

35
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,108
There's nothing can be done
about it.

36
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:16,404
>> NICK: The mood will probably
be better around here.

37
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:22,076
>> AMBER: This is how much rice

38
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,997
we have left to last us 14 days.
This is probably enough for one

39
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,338
serving.
>> NICK: This is the closest to

40
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,466
a six-pack I've ever had.
>> COLBY: You know, we're in a

41
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,093
spot now, but it's not the end
of the world.

42
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,554
My gosh, the human body can go
days without food.

43
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,389
Where the lack of food comes in
is mentally.

44
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,644
And you've got to stay tough
mentally to make it through a

45
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,312
food drought like we have right
now.

46
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,648
And you can sit around and say,
"What if, you know, what if we

47
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,067
were to say...?"
Well, we don't have any rice.

48
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,111
Woulda, coulda, shoulda.
If ifs and buts were candy and

49
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,113
nuts, we'd all have a merry
Christmas.

50
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,991
>> TINA: And if we don't catch
our food, we won't be eating

51
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,161
any food.
Here on out, it's going to have

52
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:09,165
to be everybody working
together, catching crickets,

53
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:13,044
grubs, whatever we can find in
order to have people fishing,

54
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,338
and that's no easy task on its
own.

55
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,006
>> ELISABETH: You know, we're
starving.

56
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,010
We haven't eaten in 24 hours,
and we had a lot to do, and no

57
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,512
energy-- none.
Everyone here was just in slow

58
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,391
motion.
You know, I think everyone here

59
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,687
would bring back Jerri if we had
rice to come with her.

60
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:40,738
(<i> laughing</i> )
>> KEITH: Got him.

61
00:04:40,822 --> 00:05:11,227
(<i> laughing</i> )
>> KEITH: Got him.

62
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,647
Look at that.
You show me Colby doing that.

63
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,442
A cowboy can ride bulls and
horses, but he can't catch

64
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,069
grasshoppers.
Oh, look at that-- it's coming

65
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:33,249
out.
>> COLBY: You know what?

66
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,417
I had two grasshoppers this
morning, and a frog.

67
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,713
But the big ones, you can't even
tire those guys out, man.

68
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,882
They fly forever and are very
scarce, so you can't sneak up on

69
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:44,302
those.
The ones everybody's been

70
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,928
fishing with is the little bitty
ones, which are pretty easy to

71
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,724
catch.
I haven't seen any lately.

72
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,896
>> KEITH: Yeah, I mean, you
expend a lot of energy catching

73
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,107
grasshoppers.
You chase them down, I mean,

74
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,943
you'll run sometimes for 100
yards... not 100 yards.

75
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,613
You'll run sometimes for several
yards chasing a grasshopper

76
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:09,911
down, but that grasshopper could
mean a, you know, a 15-inch

77
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,790
black bream, so it's very
important.

78
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,626
There he goes.
>> COLBY: Keith probably has the

79
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,004
upper hand on the whole
grasshopper wrangling.

80
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,132
A little more experience under
his belt.

81
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,635
You know, he's been at it a
while, and he kind of has a

82
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,013
handle on it.
>> KEITH: Just kind of stun them

83
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,142
a little bit.
>> COLBY: I've yet to figure out

84
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,646
his method, but I may have to go
to the master so he can teach

85
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,607
young grasshopper how to wrangle
grasshoppers.

86
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,944
>> KEITH: Excuse me.
I just caught a grasshopper.

87
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,823
Kind of important.
Oh, no.

88
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,456
It's like the 747 of
grasshoppers.

89
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,500
There you go.
I took a wing and a leg off.

90
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,045
I was hungry.
>> ELISABETH: Thanks.

91
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:13,766
I'm close to that.
Oh...!

92
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,522
A turtle.
I hate those turtles.

93
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm going to try and keep calm.
I don't know whether to break

94
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:35,371
this rod or try and eat it.
E-mail.

95
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,211
"Elisabeth."
What is in here?

96
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,546
There's, like,...
>> AMBER: Money in there.

97
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,716
>> ELISABETH: What is this?
>> AMBER: Wait, hold on, let me

98
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,719
read the card.
"For this next challenge, you'll

99
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,680
have to be shrewd,
It's time to find out the real

100
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,350
value of food."
>> ELISABETH: Priceless.

101
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,103
"If you don't believe a snack is
worth more than gold,

102
00:07:59,187 --> 00:07:59,896
Watch it going once, going
twice, and then it will be

103
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,733
sold."
It's going to be an auction.

104
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,067
>> AMBER: We all have a certain
amount of money to auction on

105
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,402
food.
>> ELISABETH: Check it out--

106
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,695
money.
>> RODGER: Wow!

107
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,282
>> AMBER: Yes, it's real money.
>> ELISABETH: Colby, they could

108
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,701
get us some peanut butter.
>> AMBER: But I think we'll all

109
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,078
be getting something.
>> TINA: Wow, I'm excited.

110
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,290
>> ELISABETH: You guys, we'll
get something.

111
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:28,716
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )
>> JEFF: Okay, guys, welcome to

112
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,427
the<i> Survivor</i> auction.
You each have 500 Australian

113
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,763
dollars.
Up for bid-- a variety of food

114
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:40,144
items.
If you see something you desire,

115
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,146
bid on it.
I'll tell you what the bidding

116
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,899
starts at.
The increments are $20.

117
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:49,946
First item-- $60 for four tasty
Doritos and a nice big old thing

118
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,573
of salsa to go with it.
>> AMBER: Wow!

119
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,451
>> JEFF: 60 bucks; Nick?
These are the real deal, Tina.

120
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:56,827
I know how much you like
Doritos.

121
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,455
>> TINA: I do, but that's more
than $10 a chip.

122
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:02,625
>> JEFF: Ouch!
All right, going once, twice,

123
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,628
sold to Nick for 60 bucks.
Come on down.

124
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,298
>> TINA: Oh, my gosh!
>> AMBER: Doritos, babies!

125
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:14,679
>> NICK: 20, 40, 60.
Mmm!

126
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,554
>> JEFF: You can take it back
up.

127
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,808
Next item-- how about a
little dessert?

128
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,687
Big old thing of peanut butter,
four squares of chocolate.

129
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,855
We'll start the bidding at,
uh... oh, 80 bucks.

130
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,858
>> AMBER: 80 bucks.
>> ELISABETH: 100.

131
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,987
>> TINA: 120.
>> ELISABETH: 140.

132
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,155
>> JEFF: 140, Elisabeth. Amber?
That's a lot of peanut butter.

133
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,241
>> AMBER: 160.
>> JEFF: 180, Elisabeth.

134
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,659
Going once.
200, Colby.

135
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:41,497
>> ELISABETH: 220.
>> JEFF: $220 for peanut butter

136
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,375
and chocolate.
Going once... 240. Tina.

137
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,629
240.

138
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,881
>> TINA: I know that that's
something that I...

139
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:55,303
>> JEFF: 260, Elisabeth, going
once, twice, sold to Elisabeth.

140
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,763
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh, oh,
my gosh, oh, my gosh.

141
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,148
>> JEFF: Bring a tear to your
eye.

142
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,692
>> ELISABETH: I would have paid
300 for that.

143
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,818
This is my favorite game in the
whole world.

144
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,821
I'm shaking.
>> JEFF: Right on.

145
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,073
Go back and enjoy.
Boy, you are shaking.

146
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,327
>> ELISABETH: I am.
>> JEFF: Wow!

147
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,415
Mountain Dew.
Sold to Amber for 80 dollars.

148
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,168

crackers for 120 dollars.
Sold to Keith for 180 dollars.

Take a bite.
Sold to Tina.

00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,093
She's on the board.
Sold to Nick for 100 dollars.

152
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,390
Six French fries, and a big old
dish of ranch dressing to dip it

153
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,768
in.
Sold to Amber.

154
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:49,023
>> AMBER: Mmm!
>> JEFF: Iced coffee and

155
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,733
chocolate peanut butter energy
bar.

156
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,236
A little bit of protein.

00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,911
>> AMBER: 180.
>> JEFF: 180 Amber.

160
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,873
200 Colby.
We found something Colby wants.

161
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:10,086
>> JEFF: 240 Colby.
>> AMBER: Damn you.

162
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,797
260
>> JEFF: 260 to Amber.

163
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,926
280 to Colby.
Going once, twice, sold to movie

164
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,430
star for 280.
>> COLBY: We're eating, baby.

165
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,431
>> JEFF: Big-ticket item right
there.

166
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,142
>> COLBY: Plenty more where that
came from.

167
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,189
On target right there.
Thanks, Jeff.

168
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,400
>> JEFF: Right on.
Anybody got any money left?

169
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,944
>> AMBER: Yes.
Yeah, we got a lot left.

170
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,154
>> JEFF: Good because I've got a
nice meal here.

171
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,614
>> AMBER: Hold on, hold on.
Is that mashed potatoes I see

172
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,825
there?
>> JEFF: Mashed potatoes, bread,

173
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,453
turkey, a little veggie on
there.

174
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,622
I'm thinking this is worth a lot
at this point.

175
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,749
We'll start at 180.
>> AMBER: 180.

176
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,627
>> JEFF: 180 Amber.
200 Tina, 220 to Elisabeth.

177
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,963
240, Keith.
>> ELISABETH: Can I get a loan?

178
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,091
>> TINA: Can you sell me one
piece of your turkey and half of

179
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,301
your mashed potatoes?
>> ELISABETH: Yes.

180
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,138
>> JEFF: 260 to Elisabeth.
Keith owns it at 280.

181
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,472
>> ELISABETH: Will you give me
20?

182
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,015
>> TINA: Yeah, and I'll give you
20 more, if you want to go 300.

183
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,810
>> ELISABETH: I can sell her
half?

184
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,479
>> JEFF: 300 to Elisabeth.
>> KEITH: 320.

185
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,272
>> ELISABETH: That is all he
has.

186
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,482
>> 340.
>> JEFF: 340-- Elisabeth.

187
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,984
Anybody else in on that?
One, two, three, sold to

188
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,488
Elisabeth.
>> TINA: Yes! Go, girl!

189
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,158
>> JEFF: Come on down.
$340, yours.

190
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,120
Mystery plate.
We'll start this at 120.

191
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,164
>> AMBER: 120.
>> JEFF: 120, Amber.

192
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,166
140, Keith.
>> AMBER: 160.

193
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:38,174
>> JEFF: 160, Amber.
Thinking about it, Rodger?

194
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,384
180.
>> AMBER: 200.

195
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,220
>> JEFF: 200 to Amber.
Once, twice, three times.

196
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,638
200 dollars for the mystery
plate.

197
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,848
>> Let's see what it is.
>> AMBER: I hope it's good.

198
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:52,646
Gosh, I'll be upset.
>> JEFF: That's a tall glass of

199
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,485
Herbert river water.
>> KEITH: Yes!

200
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,612
We read that one right, didn't
we?

201
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,990
>> JEFF: Rodger, I think I have
something you may like.

202
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:08,537
You cannot tell me you are not
interested in a cheeseburger?

203
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,706
>> Oh, my God.
>> RODGER: That one's coming up

204
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,625
here, son.
>> JEFF: 200.

205
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,084
Rodger?
220.

206
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:18,255
240, Rodger?
260 Keith.

207
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,216
280, Rodger.
>> KEITH: Three...

208
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,383
>> JEFF: 300, Keith.
>> RODGER: How much money you

209
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,385
got?
>> JEFF: 320, Rodger.

210
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,180
>> RODGER: Let me at it.
Oh, go ahead, hit the gavel.

211
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,098
I'm ready.
>> JEFF: Once, twice, sold to

212
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,852
Kentucky Joe.
All good things come to those

213
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:39,068
who wait.
>> RODGER: Boy, that is good.

214
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:48,911
Thank you.
>> TINA: I'm not feeling well.

215
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,746
>> AMBER: I think I'm the only
one that's feeling well.

216
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,207
>> TINA: I can't believe it
would go through you that fast.

217
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,376
>> RODGER: I was feeling sick.
I thought I was going to vomit,

218
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,377
to tell you truth.
I guess because I haven't had

219
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:02,466
hardly any food.
And ate the cheeseburger and now

220
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,593
I think I'm going to have to
make a trip over the hills to

221
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,763
the latrine.
>> NICK: I got to use the

222
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,266
restroom.
>> TINA: I think that our body

223
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,103
is so stripped of any kind of
nutrition, you know, I had

224
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,649
turkey and mashed potatoes and
some bread, and it's just...

225
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:23,779
it's just going rrrr, you know,
my body's trying to process it

226
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,906
and it's just not going too
good.

227
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,325
>> AMBER: I paid $200 for river
water.

228
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,244
But you know what, somebody had
to do it..

229
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,121
>> COLBY: Here's the deal.
You paid 200 bucks for river

230
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,290
water and yet you and I are
standing here and everybody else

231
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,292
is trying to find paper bark so
they can wipe their butts,

232
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,459
'cause they all have to go to
the bathroom.

233
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,962
>> AMBER: And I feel good.
>> NICK: I'm going to go take a

234
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,131
bath, so the whole tent doesn't
smell like ass by the end of the

235
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,844
night.
>> ELISABETH: Mine wasn't that

236
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,012
>> NICK: Mine wasn't that bad,
but I will feel much better

237
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,181
when, I mean, I'm sitting here
wiping my butt with leaves.

238
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,603
You know, you can only get so
much with leaves, I'm sure.

239
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,272
>> RODGER: Boy, that felt good.
Almost as good as eating the

240
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,816
cheeseburger.
>> NICK: Time to get in the

241
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,319
river.
Makes the ass clean.

242
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,987
>> RODGER: That's what I was
thinking about doing.

243
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,949
>> ELISABETH: Our systems were
just in shock, just absolute

244
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:13,078
shock.
Hopefully that's it for me.

245
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,624
As good as it was, I would not
take any of that away.

246
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,044
I would do it all over again, I
really would.

247
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,672
Nothing can compare to the food.
>> RODGER: My leaf had a hole in

248
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,677
it, Keith.
(<i> laughter</i> )

249
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:39,104
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )
(<i> heavy rainfall</i> )

250
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:17,226
>> TINA: The water has risen
considerably from last night,

251
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,562
and we're losing ground.
And we had our flag on the other

252
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,316
side of our tent, and I had to
move it because we don't know

253
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,986
how much longer there's going to
be beach over there.

254
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,493
>> ELISABETH: We could have been
washed away last night?

255
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,327
>> TINA: We're probably going to
have to move camp today,

256
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,747
actually.
Today or tomorrow, no doubt.

257
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,250
The water's risen.
And it must be flooding upstream

258
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:46,088
because it's quickly encroaching
on us.

259
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,215
>> ELISABETH: It might as well
be a mine field right now, I

260
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,052
mean with the weather how it is.
A storm can come and just wash

261
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,055
our tent right out.
It's right in line with the

262
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,266
riverbed where it seemed to be
rushing before.

263
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,893
And the river's already crept
up, and consumed what we had at

264
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,731
camp.
I mean, we crossed that river to

265
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,443
get here.
It's almost doubled in size.

266
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,905
I mean, it's massive right now,
and it is coming for us.

267
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,241
>> AMBER: It just keeps on
going.

268
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,745
Every day, there's something
new.

269
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,415
Unbelievable.
I'm just in shock.

270
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,171
>> ELISABETH: We're in trouble.
We need to move this camp, and

271
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:31,633
my gosh, if I feel how I did
yesterday, if everyone feels how

272
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,304
they did yesterday, I can't even
get myself out of first gear.

273
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,140
You know, you go from being
starving and then going to an

274
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,269
auction and eating, to being
starving again.

275
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:46,315
And, you know, that one meal
isn't enough to sustain you.

276
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,651
It's not.
We're still depleted.

277
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,820
It's just... it's going to be a
rough day, and we don't have

278
00:17:51,904 --> 00:18:01,955
food yet.
>> NICK: For me, not having food

279
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,169
food yet.
>> NICK: For me, not having food

280
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,173
is killer.
The lack of energy and the heat

281
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,301
and the rain, it's all real.
And tomorrow makes a month.

282
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:18,847
And a month is a long time to
lay on the ground.

283
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,184
I mean I'm 23 years old, in
pretty good athletic shape.

284
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,229
My back is killing me.
You know, I've been sick twice.

285
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,565
My mouth is raw.
Yesterday, I felt a lot better

286
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,110
after I ate, you know, I felt I
could do this for 13 more days.

287
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,362
But today, I'm just, like, oh,
God, please get me out of here

288
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:38,283
sometime soon.
>> ELISABETH: Good call, coach.

289
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,829
>> RODGER: Ooh, he liked the
hook, too, didn't he?

290
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,872
That's had a nice one.
Look how fat he is.

291
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,873
Oh, man.
>> TINA: Rodger's been out

292
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,252
fishing.
Elisabeth's been out fishing.

293
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:53,215
I've been out fishing.
Has Nick been out fishing?

294
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,886
No.
He was asked to go fishing, but

295
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,681
he said that he's never been
before and he wasn't planning on

296
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,726
starting now.
>> ELISABETH: Why, you know, let

297
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,855
your friends work extra hard
because you don't want to get up

298
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,231
and move, because you don't feel
like moving?

299
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,151
We're all sick here.
I mean, we're all weak, and I

300
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,737
never thought I'd say this.
I really never thought I would,

301
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,407
but I'm really disappointed in
Nick right now.

302
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,243
I really am.
You know, maybe we're the dumb

303
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,912
ones.
Maybe he's smart, saving his

304
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,874
energy and sleeping all day to
win immunity.

305
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,043
If we're... Rodger and I are out
there, you know, blowing all of

306
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,422
our energy on fishing and Nick
is conserving his energy wisely,

307
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,925
he's going to keep winning
immunity challenges, and that's

308
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,387
going to leave with a vote to
one of us, you know, either

309
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,472
Rodger or myself.
And that's scary.

310
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,308
That makes me mad.
>> NICK: I feel vulnerable

311
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,604
because I still remain a
physical threat to win

312
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,606
challenges.
I won the last immunity

313
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,274
challenge.
I'm a big body, so I take a lot

314
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,278
to feed.
So I'm feeling vulnerable.

315
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,946
If I don't win the immunity
challenge, I definitely expect

316
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:07,998
to go.
>> JEFF: I need to take the

317
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:25,223
to go.
>> JEFF: I need to take the

318
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,310
immunity necklace back.
>> NICK: There you go.

319
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,813
>> JEFF: Immunity back up for
grabs.

320
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,399
All right, the ability to start
fire quickly, essential to

321
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,153
survival in the outback.
Whether it's just to signal a

322
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,363
passing plane or to create
warmth, fire skills got to be

323
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:43,325
sharp.
For today's challenge, you'll

324
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,162
each be assigned a fire scale.
On one end, a fire bucket.

325
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,497
On the other end, a water
bucket.

326
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,626
Your goal: create fire in that
fire bucket and then by putting

327
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,546
water in the water bucket, tilt
the scale to raise the fire high

328
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,091
enough to light a fuse at the
top.

329
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,511
The first person to light the
fuse wins immunity.

330
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,555
Here's the hiccup.
Your water bucket has a hole in

331
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,517
it, so it's going to be a
constant battle running to the

332
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,062
river to gather water...
>> TINA: Oh, my God.

333
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,690
>> JEFF: ...and making sure your
fire still has flame.

334
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,443
Sound good?
>> TINA: It sounds good.

335
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,488
>> JEFF: They're all the same.
Pick one and let's go.

336
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,406
>> AMBER: So there's always a
catch.

337
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:30,706
It's so funny.
>> JEFF: Everybody knows where

338
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,542
their matches are, right?
>> RODGER: Yeah.

339
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,878
>> JEFF: For immunity, survivors
ready?

340
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:46,930
Go!
Two people going for water

341
00:21:47,014 --> 00:23:02,297
Go!
Two people going for water

342
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:12,390
already.
That-a-way, Rodger.

343
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:33,829
already.
That-a-way, Rodger.

344
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:48,760
Keep cooking, Keith.
Don't be deceived.

345
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:55,350
You're making progress.
Right now, we've got a lot of

346
00:23:55,433 --> 00:24:04,484
fires burning.
Ladies and gents, get moving.

347
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:33,763
fires burning.
Ladies and gents, get moving.

348
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,604
Hey, hey, hey.
No, no.

349
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:44,191
>> KEITH: Just checking balance.
>> JEFF: Don't check.

350
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,740
I know you guys are getting
tired.

351
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,242
The good news is your fires are
doing great.

352
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,245
>> NICK: Not mine.
>> JEFF: Except for you, Nick.

353
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:10,592
>> NICK: Too late to stop now.
>> KEITH: Oh, come on, come on,

354
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,093
come on.
>> JEFF: You're getting there,

355
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,929
Keith.
>> ELISABETH: There's a hole in

356
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:19,226
the bucket, dear Liza.
>> KEITH: Swing on the pot.

357
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,937
Come on. Come on.
Come on, baby.

358
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,317
Come on, baby.
Yeah! No.

359
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,570
Stay there.
No.

360
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:51,007
>> JEFF: You're close
Don't slow down.

361
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:14,864
>> COLBY: Yeah! Whoa! Yeah!
>> JEFF: Right here, man.

362
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,994
Nice work, out of nowhere.
>> COLBY: Come from behind.

363
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:52,819
>> RODGER: I've got to have
something to eat around here.

364
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,072
It makes everybody scared if we
don't have a little something.

365
00:26:56,156 --> 00:27:00,201
>> TINA: Nutritionally, our body
is going into shock.

366
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,829
None of us are used to being
this weak and not knowing really

367
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,874
what to do about it.
I know Elisabeth is not doing

368
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,711
well at all.
She had a very hard time getting

369
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,881
up this morning, just making it
out of the tent this morning,

370
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,841
I'm really concerned about her.
>> NICK: Let's take a load off

371
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,011
and get some water.
>> ELISABETH: I'm just going to

372
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:23,099
drink some water.
I'm feeling terrible.

373
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:30,940
I mean, but I'm just, like,
shaking and weak, and I'm just

374
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,736
frustrated with how I feel.
I couldn't even walk up the hill

375
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,447
to fish.
I mean, I hate not being able to

376
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:51,044
help out and get some food.
We need to get rice today.

377
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:56,132
I just want my strength back.
I'm just nauseous and, like,...

378
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,926
oh, man.
>> NICK: It's hard to get

379
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,972
started in the morning.
>> ELISABETH: Yeah.

380
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:07,936
We have nothing to sustain us
through the morning today.

381
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,479
We're praying for fish.
We have only two hooks right

382
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:12,232
now.
>> TINA: No luck.

383
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,900
Not even any bites.
Rodger got a turtle.

384
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:18,696
>> RODGER: He pulled the hook
off, so there goes another hook.

385
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,281
>> ELISABETH: I'm sorry I
couldn't make it out here

386
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,451
sooner.
I just had a rough morning.

387
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,828
>> RODGER: Why don't you come
back and rest, and then we're

388
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,288
going to go back out in a couple
of hours.

389
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,915
>> ELISABETH: Okay.
>> RODGER: Only bite I had was

390
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:33,711
that stupid turtle.
>> ELISABETH: I'm just real low.

391
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:53,773
>> RODGER: Yeah, Jeff's here.
He's got a big thing of rice.

392
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,151
>> TINA: He has a bad look on
his face.

393
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:01,448
>> JEFF: What's up, guys?
>> RODGER: Is that ours?

394
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:07,162
>> JEFF: I come today because
I'm concerned, because yesterday

395
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:11,499
at the immunity challenge, I saw
something that I haven't seen

396
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,462
before-- true lethargy, a real
lack of energy, especially with

397
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:20,383
Elisabeth and Nick.
You've got 13 days left.

398
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,885
And I don't think you're going
to make it.

399
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:25,805
So it puts me in an awkward
situation, because you had

400
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,725
plenty of stuff.
If rationed properly, you had

401
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,976
enough rice and you had 25
hooks.

402
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,104
You had a tackle box you
couldn't improve on.

403
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:37,358
So what happened with the rice?
I mean why are you out?

404
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,695
>> COLBY: We just weren't
careful with our rations.

405
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:41,696
There's not any one person to
blame.

406
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,324
We're all guilty.
>> TINA: We did each lose a bag,

407
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,200
too, to condensation in the can.
>> COLBY: But that's our own

408
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,703
fault.
>> TINA: I'm not saying it's not

409
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:49,913
our fault.
But you just asked what

410
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,333
happened, and that's part of
what happened.

411
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:57,212
>> JEFF: Here's where we're at.
My role is a giver and a taker.

412
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:02,091
Nothing comes cheap.
I have enough rice to last you

413
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,011
your last two weeks here.
>> AMBER: There's so much rice

414
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,681
there.
>> JEFF: But it's not coming

415
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,559
without a price, so I need
something back.

416
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,937
And I need something of value,
substantial value to get this

417
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,565
rice.
>> RODGER: Blankets.

418
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,441
I think blankets would be a good
tradeoff.

419
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,901
>> JEFF: Rodger, I'm talking
serious value.

420
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,196
You guys are playing for...
>> RODGER: You're laying there

421
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,740
shivering some night, those
blankets are of serious value.

422
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,033
>> JEFF: We're playing for $1
million.

423
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,536
>> TINA: Of what we have, what
do you want?

424
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:36,084
>> JEFF: I'm talking camp.
>> TINA: Camp? Our tent?

425
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,962
>> JEFF: Shelter versus food,
it's one or the other.

426
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:43,132
Your tarps and that Texas flag.
That's what I want.

427
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,385
>> AMBER: You want all the tarps
and the flag?

428
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,595
>> ELISABETH: All the tarps?
>> RODGER: How are we going to

429
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,264
keep dry when it rains?
It rains every day.

430
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,057
>> TINA: We could use rain
jackets, the top and the sleeve.

431
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,101
>> COLBY: I mean, shelter,
though.

432
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,436
That's a no-brainer.
I'm talking about my personal

433
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,398
item here.
I have no problem giving it up.

434
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,275
>> JEFF: Let me entice you a
little more:

435
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,944
25 more hooks.
>> TINA: Oh, absolutely.

436
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,947
You can have the shelter, as far
as... my vote is take the

437
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,907
shelter.
>> ELISABETH: And if we have

438
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,077
energy, we can build something.
>> JEFF: Let's do it.

439
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,955
>> TINA: Thank you, Jeff.
>> AMBER: Oh, my God.

440
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,417
>> JEFF: Who's got the strength
to tear it down?

441
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,298
I hate to have you disrupt
everything, but...

442
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,133
>> AMBER: We need our food, and
we need to your strength.

443
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,969
>> JEFF: Got to have a value.
Your tarps and that big old

444
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,389
Texas flag, engineered to be a
tarp.

445
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,402
>> COLBY: Take care of that,
please.

446
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,988
>> JEFF: I will.
Good negotiation, guys.

447
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,781
>> COLBY: Thank you very much.
>> JEFF: I hope the food gives

448
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,491
you the strength to rebuild...
>> ELISABETH: It will.

449
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,993
>> JEFF: ...to get through the
last two weeks.

450
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,370
>> AMBER: Thank you.
>> JEFF: Thanks, Rodger.

451
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,997
All right, I'll see you guys
tonight...

452
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,999
>> KEITH: All right, Jeff.
>> JEFF: ...when we have the

453
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,168
unfortunate business of dealing
with the tribal council.

454
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:04,922
So, eat up today.
Bye, guys.

455
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,222
>> COLBY: Once we realized that,
oh, my God, our shelter's gone,

456
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,184
the first thing we seemed to
have to do was get a roof over

457
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,187
our head 'cause it really seemed
like it was going to rain pretty

458
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,147
hard today.
>> RODGER: It's going to be

459
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,274
pouring down rain here tonight.
>> TINA: We need to start

460
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,026
looking for a tree cover.
>> COLBY: Actually, up in this

461
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:29,030
thing would probably be the best
just because there are so many

462
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,074
places to lay branches in here.
>> TINA: The only downside is if

463
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,035
the river comes up again.
I don't think we need to bring

464
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,912
the woods to us; I think we need
to go to the woods.

465
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,082
>> ELISABETH: Mm-hmm.
>> KEITH: So then it was trying

466
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,875
to decide where the shelter was
going to be.

467
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,544
And we had a little food this
morning but not enough to climb

468
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,171
with a hill and build a shelter
up in the hills, that's for

469
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:56,224
sure.
>> RODGER: We want to come in

470
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,394
here with some limbs and angle
them down so it will run as much

471
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,188
water off as we can.
>> TINA: I think it was a fair

472
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:07,527
trade.
If we can keep the rains away,

473
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,904
as long as it's not a torrential
downpour.

474
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:14,867
We may get wet.
But there's worse things in life

475
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,246
than being wet, such as starving
to death.

476
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:23,584
>> COLBY: Hey, Nick, can you
bring some of that brush down?

477
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:29,048
>> TINA: Think chopping up this
chest is good?

478
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:33,177
We're using everything that we
possibly can at this point.

479
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:42,103
Every little bit helps.
>> RODGER: I got some more.

480
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,731
>> NICK: All right.
>> TINA: What do you need most

481
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,941
of right now?
We got grass.

482
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:49,527
>> COLBY: I need grass and pine,
that's it.

483
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,077
It's looking solid already.
>> TINA: Maybe it won't even

484
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,329
rain tonight.
>> COLBY: Maybe not.

485
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,124
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )
>> TINA: Maybe so.

486
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,169
>> NICK: Maybe so.
>> AMBER: I feel a couple of

487
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:11,340
raindrops.
>> TINA: Might as well get used

488
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,178
to it.
>> NICK: These branches are not

489
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:19,307
going to keep us totally dry.
It's going to be more water-

490
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,477
resistant than waterproof.
>> RODGER: At least we got food,

491
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:32,570
brother.
>> COLBY: Amber's a little bit

492
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:38,993
brother.
>> COLBY: Amber's a little bit

493
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:41,662
nervous about the fact that we
voted Jerri off.

494
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:46,000
She felt like she might be the
next one that we go after.

495
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,960
That way Amber won't know
anything.

496
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,671
>> KEITH: A smart move.
>> COLBY: It could be

497
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,341
potentially deadly for all three
of us.

498
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,550
>> AMBER: Can you help me carry
this?

499
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:59,680
>> COLBY: She and Elisabeth have
been bonding quite well.

500
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,975
She could very easily go over
to the guys from Kucha and say,

501
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,352
"Hey, look, I know they're going
after me next.

502
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,897
I want to jump on with you
guys."

503
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,816
>> ELISABETH: If I were Amber,
I'd feel threatened.

504
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,359
I mean, if everyone can make
Jerri go away, she can just as

505
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:21,786
easily go away.
But by voting Jerri off, Ogakor

506
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,664
diluted their power a bit.
It didn't seem to be the

507
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,584
smartest strategic thing to do.
>> AMBER: Okay, guys.

508
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,841
>> ELISABETH: And, now, I think
they are worried about Amber

509
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:38,928
approaching us.
Amber is kind of a pivot in the

510
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,306
whole Barramundi scenario.
Bon appétit.

511
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:51,065
>> TINA: That is good rice.
It's so nice to have rice again.

512
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,276
>> AMBER: I could approach the
Kucha people and go against

513
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,613
Colby, Tina and Keith.
And it would be four against

514
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,283
three and we could just pick
them off one by one.

515
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,244
But how do I know that I can
100% trust the Kucha members,

516
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,121
that they're not just playing
with my mind and just pretending

517
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,207
to agree with me?
I guess I don't know if I can

518
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,585
trust Ogakor people, too.
They could be playing with my

519
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,754
mind, too, but I have to play
the game.

520
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,885
And the game's getting harder
and harder as the days go on.

521
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:22,763
>> RODGER: We need to be heading
out.

522
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,309
I guess we're ready.
>> AMBER: Let's go.

523
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:30,313
>> RODGER: You're not bringing
anything, Keith?

524
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:55,129
>> JEFF: We'll now bring in our
jury: Alicia and Jerri.

525
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,464
I'll remind you that the jury's
not to be addressed.

526
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,466
They won't address you.
They're merely here to gather

527
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,929
information to help them
determine who's going to get the

528
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:07,475
$1 million and the title of
Survivor.

529
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:12,480
Okay, first things first.
What was the reaction after I

530
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,441
left, with all your tarps and
your Texas flag that you guys

531
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,653
have food?
Tina, did you feel the

532
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,322
negotiation was fair?
>> TINA: I definitely feel like

533
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,157
it was fair.
That was something that we could

534
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,494
rebuild.
And even though you took it away

535
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,497
from us, it's not like it
couldn't be replaced.

536
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,167
And so, to be quite honest, I
was grateful that that's what

537
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,878
you chose.
>> JEFF: Nick, obviously, you

538
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,548
came into this a very fit guy.
Are you surprised at the toll

539
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,467
it's taken on your body?
>> NICK: I'm definitely

540
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,637
surprised.
I mean, I stood up today and I

541
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,681
felt like I was really going to
pass out.

542
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,516
I was waving back and forth and
felt bad.

543
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,020
And the last three days have
been so incredibly tough.

544
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,022
>> JEFF: Direct question: Colby,
anybody here not pulling their

545
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,984
weight?
>> COLBY: No.

546
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,737
I don't think so.
>> JEFF: Rodger?

547
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,489
>> RODGER: Overall, I think
it's... everybody's been pulling

548
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,659
their weight.
>> JEFF: Amber, how have you

549
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:10,705
grown as a person, being out
here 28 days now?

550
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,208
>> AMBER: I am a lot more open
than I ever thought I would be,

551
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,877
and I'm willing to try new
things and do new things.

552
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,213
And I'm a much riskier person
now.

553
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,883
It might have taken a really
hard experience to learn that

554
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,052
about myself, but I think it's
definitely worth it.

555
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,388
>> JEFF: I want you guys to just
take a second and look at Alicia

556
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,726
and Jerri.
Slowly the power base shifts

557
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,062
from this side to that side.
In the end, it comes down to

558
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,773
politics.
How can you possibly vote

559
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,110
somebody out and get their vote
at the end?

560
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,363
I just want to remind you of
that as we go vote.

561
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:53,414
Elisabeth, you're up.
>> NICK: My vote is for Keith

562
00:38:53,497 --> 00:39:16,062
Elisabeth, you're up.
>> NICK: My vote is for Keith

563
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,940
tonight because, unlike
everybody else, he didn't feel

564
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,777
the need to bring his backpack,
and that's just flat out

565
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:32,828
arrogance.
>> TINA: You seem like a really

566
00:39:32,912 --> 00:40:02,024
arrogance.
>> TINA: You seem like a really

567
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,486
great guy, but you said you were
tired of playing the game, and

568
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,654
that you weren't having fun
anymore.

569
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:16,330
So, here's your ticket, buddy.
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

570
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:26,423
votes.
I'll read the votes.

571
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:31,720
votes.
I'll read the votes.

572
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:47,945
The first vote, Nick.
Amber.

573
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:58,747
Keith.
Amber.

574
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:06,755
Two votes, Amber.
Nick.

575
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,551
Two votes, Nick.
Two votes, Amber.

576
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:19,393
One vote, Keith.
That's three votes, Nick.

577
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:24,899
Last vote...
Nick.

578
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,652
You need to bring me your torch.
>> NICK: You guys play tough.

579
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,446
>> RODGER: See you later.
>> ELISABETH: Bye.

580
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:34,950
>> RODGER: Hang in there.
Hang in there.

581
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,162
>> NICK: I hope it doesn't rain
tonight.

582
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,460
>> JEFF: Nick, the tribe has
spoken.

583
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:56,931
>> TINA: Bye, Nick.
>> JEFF: For the rest of you

584
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,768
guys, I wish for you dry, hot
weather with no rain.

585
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,021
You can head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.

586
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,128
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode, and hear

587
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:33,801
what Nick has to say.
>> JEFF: Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

588
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,679
>> ELISABETH: This game, in the
past three days, has become

589
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,848
drastically primal.
>> JEFF: Has Barramundi been

590
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:45,271
pushed to the brink, or is their
greatest challenge yet to come?

591
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,647
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God.
>> RODGER: Our camp is a dry

592
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,818
creek bed.
I doubt if it's dry right now.

593
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,952
>> NICK: It's been a great
adventure, have some great

594
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,871
times, and some big blows.
The last few days have

595
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,667
been really rough on me, and
it's taught me a lot about not

596
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,877
only my strengths but more
importantly my weaknesses.

597
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:13,007
I kind of feel invincible at
times, and<i> Survivor</i> has been a

598
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,510
big reality check for me.
It's been a ride, it's

599
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:18,012
definitely been a ride.
