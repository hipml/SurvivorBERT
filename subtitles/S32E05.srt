1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:05,714
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,966
"SURVIVOR"... SINCE DAY ONE THE

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,175
GAME HAS BEEN A FIGHT AND

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,510
NOTHING HAS COME EASY.

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,846
>> I'M NOT GETTING DIRTY AT ALL.

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,723
>> Jeff: IDOLS WERE FOUND BY

7
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,850
TAI AND JASON.

8
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,517
>> OH.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,185
>> Jeff: ALLIANCES WERE MADE.

10
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,396
>> WE'RE PRETTY TIGHT.

11
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,397
>> Jeff: AND BROKEN.

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,525
>> I'M JUST SHOCKED.

13
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,068
>> HE'S A TOTAL NARCISSIST,

14
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:27,569
STILL ON THE PERIPHERY.

15
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,028
>> Jeff: BUT NOTHING COMPARED

16
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,613
TO THE BATTLE WITH MOTHER

17
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:30,822
NATURE.

18
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,281
ALL RIGHT.

19
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,449
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN

20
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,533
EVACUATION.

21
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,743
AND CALEB WAS HER FIRST VICTIM.

22
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,828
>> NOW IT'S ONLY NICK AND I.

23
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,454
NOW THE GIRLS HAVE THE CHOICE

24
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,663
WHO TO KICK OUT.

25
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,249
>> Jeff: AT THE LAST IMMUNITY

26
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,667
CHALLENGE, THE BRAWN TRIBE LOST

27
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,336
FOR THE THIRD TIME.

28
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,588
SENDING BRAWN BACK THE TRIBAL

29
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,964
COUNCIL.

30
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,091
AND AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, SCOT,

31
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,136
JASON AND CYDNEY DIDN'T LET

32
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,137
ALECIA ESCAPE ANOTHER VOTE.

33
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,556
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

34
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,682
13 ARE LEFT.

35
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,519
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

36
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,187
Captioning funded by CBS

37
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,229
and FORD.

38
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:20,246
We go further, so you can.

39
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:29,130
>> HOW'S YOUR FINGER?

40
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:29,756
>> I'VE BEEN SOAKING IT IN SALT

41
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,174
WATER.

42
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,427
I'M HEATING UP ANOTHER BATCH.

43
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,347
I TRIED TO LANCE IT.

44
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,891
IT KIND OF HEALED UP IN THE

45
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,225
SUMMER.

46
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,476
SINCE THE LAST VOTE WHERE I FEEL

47
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,311
IN THIS PACK IS AT THE BOTTOM.

48
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,146
I FEEL LIKE A NEUTERED DOG RIGHT

49
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,982
NOW BECAUSE I HAVE NO PLAY.

50
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,401
>> DR. PETER TO THE E.R.

51
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,654
DR. PETER TO THE E.R.

52
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,988
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE HIM, LOOKING

53
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:54,322
LIKE THIS?

54
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,616
IT'S STRATEGICALLY CRUCIAL THAT

55
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,826
I START PANDERING TO THESE

56
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,034
PEOPLE.

57
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,454
SO I GO INTO DOCTOR MODE.

58
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,623
>> A LITTLE REDNESS RIGHT THERE,

59
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,082
BUT THAT'S IT.

60
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,000
>> YOU CAN'T BEND IT BECAUSE

61
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,127
IT'S SO SWOLLEN, THAT'S BAD.

62
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,087
YOU'RE NOT THERE.

63
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,797
RIGHT NOW IT'S DR. PETER'S

64
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,381
CLINIC, BUT IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO

65
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,008
MAKE THEM FEEL AS IF THEY NEED

66
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:14,175
ME.

67
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,553
>> HE'S SO GENTLE.

68
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,638
>> RETURN TO THE TRAUMA CENTER

69
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:18,930
HERE.

70
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,890
>> THANK GOD WE HAVE YOU, PETER.

71
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,393
>> IF THEY SEE ME AS SOMEONE WHO

72
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,561
IS FUNCTIONAL AND USEFUL, I'M

73
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,395
GOING TO EXPLOIT THAT AND TRY TO

74
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,897
GET MYSELF OUT OF THIS MESS I

75
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,565
GOT MYSELF IN.

76
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,942
>> DOCTOR, WHAT'S THE PROGNOSIS?

77
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,860
WILL THE PATIENT LIVE?

78
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,946
>> YES, THE PATIENT WILL LIVE.

79
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,406
>> $475, PLEASE.

80
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,408
>> WE HAVE A TRIBE OF FIVE.

81
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,829
IF FOUR PEOPLE ARE ALIGNED AND

82
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:59,470
ONE CANCER NAMED

83
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,873
I BRUSHED SOME LEAVES AND

84
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,666
THERE'S A BOX BURIED IN THE

85
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,043
EARTH.

86
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:38,051
BUT THE BOX HAS A PADLOCK ON IT.

87
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:38,426
CONGRATULATIONS.

88
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,427
YOU FIND THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

89
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,512
FIRST YOU WILL NEED A KEY TO

90
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,389
OPEN THE BOX.

91
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,724
FOLLOW THE MAP TO THE TREE AND

92
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:45,600
LOOK UP.

93
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,935
THIS WILL HELP PUSH THE KEY OUT

94
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,895
OF THE CANISTER.

95
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,772
I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET IT.

96
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,397
I'M CONFIDENT I'VE GOTTEN HERE.

97
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,482
I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

98
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,484
I'M GOING TO GO FIND THAT.

99
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,402
BUT WILL I GET CAUGHT IN THAT

100
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,695
PROCESS?

101
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,740
SO I HAVE TO MOVE VERY, VERY

102
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,326
FAST.

103
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,369
I SCAMPER ACROSS THE ISLAND

104
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,330
LOOKING UP AT EVERY COCONUT

105
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,748
TREE, AND SURE ENOUGH, RIGHT

106
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,626
BEHIND ONE, IS A CYLINDER WITH A

107
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,087
LITTLE HOLE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM

108
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:23,471
TO PUSH THAT TOOL THROUGH.

109
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:30,395
THE KEY TO THE IDOL.

110
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:40,947
THE IDOL.

111
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,531
THE KING HAS HIS IDOL.

112
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,574
THERE'S A TWIST TO THE IDOL.

113
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,952
IF YOU PAIR ONE IMMUNITY IDOL

114
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:46,995
WITH ANOTHER IMMUNITY IDOL, THEY

115
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,913
FIT TOGETHER TO FORM ONE SUPER

116
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,288
IDOL.

117
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,581
THE SUPER IDOL CAN BE PLAYED

118
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,334
AFTER THE VOTES HAVE BEEN READ.

119
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,544
THE LAST RULE IS A TWIST IN THE

120
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,630
GAME THAT IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE

121
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,507
TWO IDOLS, THEY CAN BE COMBINED

122
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,968
INTO ONE SUPER IDOL.

123
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,678
SO NOW THE GOAL IS TO FIND

124
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,180
ANOTHER IDOL.

125
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,890
OR SOMEBODY THAT HAS AN IDOL.

126
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,517
ONE OF MY PHILOSOPHIES IN LIFE

127
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,020
IS YOU MAKE YOUR OWN LUCK.

128
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:12,603
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.

129
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,273
IF SOMEBODY IS BETTING IN VEGAS,

130
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:19,485
I'M THE FRONT-RUNNER.

131
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:29,328
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

132
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,538
BRAIN TRIBE, BEAUTY TRIBE

133
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,748
GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT THE

134
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,833
NEW BRAWN TRIBE.

YOU ARE ALSO GETTING YOUR LAST

138
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,432
LOOK AT THE BRAWN TRIBE.

139
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,518
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR BUFFS.

140
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,021
>> OH, NO.

141
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,314
>> Jeff: WE'RE SWITCHING

142
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:01,319
THINGS UP.

143
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:13,706
>> WOW.

144
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,169
(<i> THEME SONG PLAYING</i> )

145
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,517
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY DROP YOUR

146
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,559
BUFFS.

147
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,812
WE ARE SWITCHING THINGS UP.

148
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,479
>> OH.

149
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,523
>> WOW.

150
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,067
>> MY GOD.

151
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,277
>> Jeff: ORIGINALLY WE WERE

152
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,570
PLANNING ON SPLITTING THE TRIBES

153
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,906
TODAY WITH 14 PEOPLE INTO TWO

154
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,576
TRIBES OF SEVEN.

155
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,745
CALEB'S UNFORTUNATE EVACUATION

156
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,247
CHANGED THE NUMBERS AND LEFT US

157
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,833
WITH AN UNEVEN NUMBER AT 13.

158
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,584
>> OH, MY GOD.

159
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,961
>> Jeff: SO HERE'S WHAT'S

160
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:04,423
GOING TO HAPPEN: THERE ARE 13

BUFFS.

162
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:12,390
THERE ARE SIX BLUE, SIX YELLOW,

163
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,266
ONE RED.

164
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,393
WHOEVER DRAWS THE RED BUFF WILL

165
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:19,313
GO BACK TO BRAWN BEACH ALONE.

166
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,482

168
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,484
TO FEND FOR YOURSELF, FOOD,

00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,528
FIRE, WATER, THE WORKS.

170
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,865
THE GOOD NEWS IS WHILE YOU'RE ON

171
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,366
BRAWN BEACH, YOU WILL NOT

172
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,118

YOU CAN'T BE VOTED OUT.

176

THE BAD NEWS: WHILE YOU ARE ON

BRAWN BEACH, YOU WON'T BE ABLE

178

ALLIANCES.

180
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,424
YOU WILL HAVE TO RELY ON YOUR

00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,592
CURRENT ALLIANCES TO KEEP YOU

YOU WILL RETURN, JOINING THE

185

TRIBE THAT LOSES THE PERSON AT

187
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,104
SHALL WE DRAW?

188
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:00,813
>> YES.

00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,856
>> YES, SIR.

190
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,274
>> LET'S DO IT.

191
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,193
>> Jeff: TAKE ONE.

192
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,113
PLEASE DON'T OPEN IT YET.

193
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,656
>> WHICH ONE DO YOU RECOMMEND,

194
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,824
JEFF?

195
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:17,455
>> Jeff: FOLLOW YOUR GUT.

196
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:21,500
>> OH, MY GOD, THIS IS SO NERVE

197
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:21,751
RACKING.

198
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,168
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

199
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,461
LET'S END THE SUSPENSE.

200
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:27,798
EVERYBODY OPEN YOUR NEW BUFFS.

201
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,549
>> YELLOW.

202
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,384
>> I'M BLUE.

203
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:30,718
>> BLUE.

204
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,680
>> YELLOW.

205
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,766
>> MY GOD.

206
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,601
>> Jeff: JULIA.

207
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,770
>> I HAD LIKE A GUT FEELING.

208
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,022
>> Jeff: IF YOU HAVE BLUE,

209
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,106
MOVE OVER TO THE BLUE MATT.

210
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,025
IF YOU HAVE YELLOW, MOVE OVER TO

211
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,109
THE YELLOW MAT.

212
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,196
AND IF YOU HAVE RED, JULIA, FIND

213
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,825
YOUR SPOT ALONE.

214
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,952
>> HI.

215
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,245
I'M MICHELE.

216
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,746
>> DEBBIE.

217
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,706
>> SCOT.

218
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,166
MICHELE, NICE TO MEET YOU.

219
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,501
PETER, NICE TO MEET YOU.

220
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,710
HOW ARE YOU?

221
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,380
>> Jeff: REALLY INTERESTING

222
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,130
REDIVISION OF TRIBES.

223
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,633
THE BLUE TRIBE, YOUR NEW NAME IS

224
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,051
CHAN LOH.

225
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,972
WE HAVE TWO BRAINS, TWO BEAUTY,

226
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,597
TWO BRAWN.

227
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,849
CAN'T GET ANY MORE EVEN THAN

228
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,976
THAT.

229
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,560
NEAL, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS

230
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:21,769
TRIBE?

231
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,104
>> IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOME

232
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:23,813
STRENGTH.

233
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,939
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOME

234
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:25,648
SMARTS AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE

235
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,692
SOME BEAUTY, SO I'LL TAKE IT.

236
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,778
I'M TALKING ABOUT MYSELF MOSTLY.

237
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,154
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YELLOW

238
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,614
TRIBE, YOUR NEW NAME IS GONDOL.

239
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,575
WE HAVE THREE BRAINS, TWO

240
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,952
BEAUTY, ONE BRAWN.

241
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,246
ANOTHER PRETTY EVEN

242
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,124
DISTRIBUTION.

243
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:43,708
JULIA.

244
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,333
>> YES.

245
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,252
>> Jeff: HERE YOU ARE ON

246
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:46,836
EITHER SIDE.

247
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,046
THE NEW TRIBES ARE EXCITED,

248
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,756
READY TO GO BACK THE CAMP TO SEE

249
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,757
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

250
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,091
YOU'RE ALONE.

251
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,801
>> I'M ALONE.

252
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,386
>> Jeff: YOU WILL HAVE TO

253
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:55,845
SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN.

254
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,762
>> I THINK I'M GOING TO BE OKAY.

255
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,181
I'M GOING TO LOOK AT IT IN A

256
00:09:59,265 --> 00:09:59,765
POSITIVE WAY.

257
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,309
I WOULD SAY THE ONE DOWN SIDE IS

258
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:01,892
NOT BEING ABLE TO GET TO KNOW

259
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,184
EVERYONE.

260
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,395
I'M GOING TO COME IN KIND OF THE

261
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,189
ODD ONE OUT, ESPECIALLY IF

262
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,233
BEAUTY GETS VOTED OFF AT THIS

263
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,486
NEXT IMMUNITY.

264
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,029
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JULIA.

265
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,823
HEAD OUT AND GOOD LUCK.

266
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:16,866
>> BYE GUYS.

267
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,242
GOOD LUCK.

268
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,328
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, CHAN LOH,

269
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,454
GONDOL, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD

270
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:21,912
BACK TO YOUR NEW CAMP.

271
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,123
THE GAME HAS JUST CHANGED.

272
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:24,790
>> WHAT THE HECK.

273
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,919
THE GIRL'S ALLIANCE GOT CLEAN

274
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,170
DIVIDED.

275
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,379
TO HAVE THE PEOPLE YOU TRUST

276
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,132
MOST OUT HERE GO THREE DIFFERENT

277
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:42,391
WAYS, IT'S CRUSHING.

278
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,061
>> WELCOME, GUYS.

279
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,314
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

280
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:48,814
>> WE HAVE FRUIT.

281
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,609
WE HAVE ONE CHICKEN LEFT OUT OF

282
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:51,817
THREE.

283
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,068
>> WHAT?

284
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,527
>> WE HAVE MANGOES.

285
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,780
>> WE HAVE A MANGO TREE.

286
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,280
WE DISCOVER MANGDO TREE.

287
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,741
>> YOU GUYS HAVE DONE WELL FOR

288
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:58,991
YOURSELF.

289
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,826
>> THIS SWAP IS EXACTLY WHAT I

290
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,119
NEEDED BECAUSE IF THAT DIDN'T

291
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,163
HAPPEN, I WAS DEAD.

292
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:04,830
MY ALLIANCE MEMBER WAS VOTED OUT

293
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,459
BEFORE ME AND I WAS THE NEXT

294
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:08,918
LOWEST-HANGING FRUIT.

295
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,336
NOW IT'S IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO

296
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,170
GO FORWARD TOGETHER.

297
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,546
>> I'M PETER AGAIN.

298
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,005
>> ANNA.

299
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:13,881
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

300
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,840
>> PETER, HI.

301
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,551
>> ON THIS TRIBE THERE ARE THREE

302
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,012
BRAINS, TWO BEAUTY, ONE BRAWN.

303
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,514
WE'RE THE MAJORITY.

304
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,474
I'M SET UP RIGHT NOW TO EASILY

305
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,892
MAKE IT INTO THE MERGE WITHOUT

306
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,770
EVEN HAVING ANY CONCERN OR EVEN

307
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,689
A BEAD OF SWEAT DOWN MY EYEBROW.

308
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,858
>> SEE THAT TREE, THAT'S A

309
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,109
MANNINGO.

310
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,819
I CAN CLIMB THAT TREE.

311
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,948
I NEED A BOOST UP, A BOOST UP.

312
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,242
>> SOME OF THOSE I CAN REACH

313
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,369
RIGHT NOW.

314
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:43,828
GOOD FOR SOMETHING.

315
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:48,707
I'M THE SOLE BROWN, AND I'M

316
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,333
THINKING, ALL RIGHT, I'M ON THE

317
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,586
BOTTOM OF THE TOTEM POLE.

318
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,255
>> HE CAN RUN AROUND AND EAT

319
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:54,630
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

320
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,257
>> IT'S FAMILIAR FEELING FOR ME.

321
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,841
I PLAYED FOR FIVE DIFFERENT

322
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,510
TEAMS IN THE NBA, AND EACH TIME

323
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,845
YOU'RE JOINING A GROUP OF PEOPLE

324
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,971
YOU USED TO PLAY AGAINST AND YOU

325
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,640
USED TO FIGHT AGAINST.

326
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,724
>> THIS IS A PALM.

327
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,809
>> I CAN HANDLE IT.

328
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,769
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IF I

329
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,646
CAN TRUST ANYBODY, WHO IT IS,

330
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,814
AND IF IT'S GOING TO DO ME ANY

331
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,106
GOOD.

332
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,817
>> WINNER, WINNER, CHICKEN

333
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,025
DINNER.

334
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,652
>> WE WILL HAVE A CHICKEN

335
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,570
DINNER, TOO.

336
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,363
>> CRAZY.

337
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,408
>> WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

338
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,326
>> I SAY WE LOSE THE CHALLENGE,

339
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,828
WHOEVER WE ELIMINATE WE'LL BE

340
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,121
REPLACED BY BEAUTY.

341
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:27,830
THE LOGICAL THING IS TO TAKE OUT

342
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,081
A BEAUTY.

343
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,167
>> I MIGHT HAVE THREE BRAINS IN

344
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,626
NUMBER, BUT WITH PETER, THAT

345
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,919
MIGHT ONLY BE TWO.

346
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,838
I DON'T TRUST PETER AS FAR AS I

347
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,091
CAN THROW HIM.

348
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,509
LOGICALLY IN NUMBERS, DOES IT

349
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,511
MAKE SENSE TO GO WITH PETER,

350
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,971
YEAH, IT DOES, ESPECIALLY IF

351
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,890
THERE'S POTENTIAL A BEAUTY COULD

352
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:46,390
COME BACK TO THIS TRIBE.

353
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:51,520
>> PUT YOUR HEAD ON THE PILLOW.

354
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,314
>> IF JULIA COMES BACK FROM THE

355
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,899
BRAWN TRIBE, SHE'S GOING TO BE

356
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,941
ANOTHER BEAUTY AND WE'LL LOSE

357
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:56,233
THE NUMBERS.

358
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,693
IT WILL BE 3-3.

359
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:01,322
>> WHAT DO WE DO IF WE LOSE A

360
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:01,572
CHALLENGE?

361
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,615
IT'S A BEAUTY.

362
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,074
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT MANY BEAUTIES

363
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:04,325
AROUND.

364
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,951
>> I'D RATHER DO THAT BECAUSE

365
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,703
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.

366
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,996
ONE THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN,

367
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,499
ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHAT?

368
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,584
I'M ABSOLUTELY ALONE.

369
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,877
BUT BRAIN TRIBE SEEMINGLY HAS

370
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,337
ALREADY MADE THE DECISION.

371
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,921
EVERYBODY IS ON BOARD TO TAKE

372
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,964
OUT A BEAUTY.

373
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,258
>> COMFORTABLE?

374
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,844
>> BUT PEOPLE SAY ONE THING, AND

375
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,179
THEN THEY TURN AROUND FIVE

376
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:25,888
MINUTES LATER AND SAY SOMETHING

377
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,055
ELSE.

378
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,265
>> HOW IT IS?

379
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:28,557
COMFORTABLE?

380
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,767
WE CAN ACTUALLY ALL FIT.

381
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,685
>> WHO KNOWS?

382
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:44,865
IT MIGHT SWITCH ALL OVER AGAIN.

383
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,117
>> WELCOME TO OUR VERY HUMBLE

384
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:47,785
ABODE.

385
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,078
IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU ALL.

386
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,037
I.

387
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,872
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

388
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,791
EXPECTED THE SWITCH TODAY.

389
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,917
I WAS STUNNED.

390
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,212
ON BEAUTY THE GIRLS' ALLIANCE IS

391
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:58,671
REALLY, REALLY TIGHT.

392
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,339
WE'RE ALL I CAN VOIDED NOW, US

393
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,966
TREE GIRLS, AND IT'S

394
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,133
NERVE-RACKING.

395
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,093
>> LET ME FIND OUT.

396
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,429
>> YES.

397
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,639
>> HOW'S IT GOING?

398
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,891
>> THE ONLY THING IS TO GO DOWN

399
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,979
ALL THE WAY, DEBBIE.

400
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,399
>> SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK,

401
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:18,899
HONESTLY?

402
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,859
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME, KIDS.

403
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,318
IT'S YOUR HOME.

404
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,195
>> ON MY TRIBE I FIND MYSELF

405
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,989
WITH TWO BEAUTY, TWO BRAIN, TWO

406
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:25,197
BRAWN.

407
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,073
>> WE'RE ALL BLEEDING BLUE RIGHT

408
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:26,240
NOW.

409
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,075
>> SO THERE'S A LOT TO THINK

410
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,577
ABOUT.

411
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,077
IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH

412
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,953
ADJUSTMENT, BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP

413
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,121
YOUR HEAD UP AND READ PEOPLE

414
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,665
UNTIL IT COMES TIME WHERE I'VE

415
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,375
GOT TO MAKE AN ALLIANCE.

416
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,044
>> NEAL AND I ARE PROPOSING ONCE

417
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,006
WE GET SOME FOOD IN US, GO

418
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,257
SCROUNGING AND WE GET PROBABLY

419
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,800
THE LAST CUP OF COFFEE AND WE

420
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,635
WATCH THE SUNSET GO DOWN

421
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:46,969
TOGETHER.

422
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,929
THE NEW CHAN LOH TRIBE IS A GOOD

423
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:49,221
TRIBE.

424
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,931
IT WAS A WARM WELCOME TO OUR

425
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,100
HUMBLE ABODE, BUT IMMEDIATELY

426
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,768
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR AN OPENING

427
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,313
BECAUSE MY GAME PLAY IS I'M ON

428
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,981
THE OFFENSE, NOT THE DEFENSE.

429
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,150
AND FROM THE GET-GO, I WANTED TO

430
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,986
WORK WITH BRAWN BECAUSE THE

431
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,195
BRAWN TRIBE DEFINITELY IS THE

432
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,947
POWER HOUSE.

433
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,116
>> AND I THOUGHT I WORK OUT HARD

434
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,117
AND TRAIN HARD THAT.

435
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,619
GIRL MAKES ME LOOK LIKE CHICKEN

436
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:11,827
LITTLE.

437
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,579
I WAS REALLY RIPPED TWO WEEKS

438
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:13,829
AGO.

439
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:14,872
>> UH-HUH.

440
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,373
>> SO WE'RE ON A WALK LOOKING

441
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,043
FOR COCONUTS AND DEBBIE HAS A

442
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,003
VERY MOTHERLY VIBE AND IT

443
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:21,962
DEFINITELY COULD BE GOOD FOR ME

444
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,089
TO HAVE LIKE A MOTHERLY FIGURE

445
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:24,381
AROUND, TOO.

446
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,383
SO I THINK IT COULD BE A GOOD

447
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:26,550
DUO.

448
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,092
>> I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE

449
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,094
REALLY THE TRIPLE THREAT, JUST

450
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,054
THE WAY I COULD HEAR YOU

451
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,514
BRIEFLY, I SAID, AND SHE'S

452
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,266
REALLY SMART.

453
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,059
YOU HAVE TO BE SMART.

454
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,477
YOU HAVE TO HAVE DISCIPLINE TO

455
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,519
BE BUILT LIKE YOU ARE.

456
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,063
>> I'VE BEEN PLAYING THE DUMB

457
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:43,108
JOCK ROLE, BUT I HAVEN'T TOLD

458
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:43,984
ANYBODY THAT I WENT TO ONE OF

459
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,570
THE TOP SCHOOLS IN THE NATION.

460
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,738
YOU WOULDN'T WITH LIKE, SHE'S SO

461
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:47,946
SMART.

462
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,614
NO.

463
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,115
THAT'S JUST NOT WHAT I GIVE OFF.

464
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,910
BUT I DID GO TO AN IVY LEAGUE

465
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,160
SCHOOL.

466
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,579
IT TOOK A LOT TO GET THERE,

467
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,580
ESPECIALLY GROWING UP IN THE

468
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,831
ATLANTA PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.

469
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,124
>> YOU ANDRY CLOSE.

470
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,376
>> OKAY.

471
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,211
>> WE DON'T APPEAR CLOSE AND WE

472
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,214
ABSOLUTELY KNOW HOW TO ZIP IT.

473
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,006
>> OKAY.

474
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,465
THAT'S THE KEY THING.

475
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,926
>> KEEP IN MIND, EVENTUALLY I

476
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,052
WANT TO SEE A WOMAN WIN THIS.

477
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:10,260
>> YES.

478
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,595
>> OKAY.

479
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,805
I'M WITH YOU ON THAT ONE.

480
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,682
>> I SPOKE WITH CYDNEY ABOUT MY

481
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,809
PLAN OF THE TWO BRAWNS HOOKING

482
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,810
UP WITH THE TWO BRAINS.

483
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,436
NOW I NEED TO SPEAK TO JASON AND

484
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,021
MAKE IT A FOURSOME.

485
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,606
>> YOU TALKED TO CYDNEY?

486
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,320
>> YES.

487
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,531
>> FIRST TIME I SAW HER, I JUST

488
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,658
LIKED HER, THE ATHLETICISM AND

489
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,118
SO WE KIND OF WANTED TO TAKE OUT

490
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,119
A BEAUTY IF IT CAME TO IT.

491
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,079
AND LET THEM KNOW WHAT IT'S

492
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,497
LIKE.

493
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,081
I ALL RIGHT WENT TO CYDNEY.

494
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,500
I ALREADY WENT TO JASON.

495
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,710
WE HAVE A FOURSOME.

496
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,670
DING, KA-CHING, KA-CHING.

497
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,215
WE GOT A CYANIDE TRIPLE BOND

498
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,676
CARBON NITROGEN.

499
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,010
YOU'RE NOT BREAKING IT BETWEEN

500
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,095
US BECAUSE IN THIS GAME YOU HAVE

501
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,304
TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY, AND YOU

502
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,890
HAVE TO HAVE STRENGTH.

503
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,976
ONCE AGAIN I'M THE MASTERMIND

504
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,978
BEHIND THE SCENE, AND THEY JUST

505
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:05,774
DON'T SEE ME COMING.

506
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,204
>> YEAH, THE OUTSIDE OF IT, IT'S

507
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,247
A THICK MEAT COCONUT.

508
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,081
I'LL OPEN IT.

509
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,833
I'LL SHOW YOU.

510
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,127
WITH CALEB BEING GONE, I THINK

511
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,839
ABOUT A DEAR FRIEND, BUT THE

512
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,674
SWITCH HAPPENED AND WE COME

513
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,509
TOGETHER AS A NEW TRIBE, SO

514
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,011
THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO

515
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:34,970
MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

516
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:35,512
>> YOU'RE VERY GRACIOUS WITH

517
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,513
YOUR FOOD.

518
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,307
THANK YOU.

519
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,059
>> WE'RE GOING TO REPAY YOU BY

520
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:41,310
WINNING.

521
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,853
>> TAI IS GREAT.

522
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,521
IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE A GUY

523
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,272
IN YOUR TRIBE THAT KEEPS THINGS

524
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,482
JOVIAL.

525
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,691
HE KNOWS HOW TO DO EVERYTHING.

526
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:47,983
THAT'S COOL.

527
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,110
I LIKE PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

528
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,323
>> SCOT, WANT TO GO PICK MANGO?

529
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,407
I NEED A BOOST.

530
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,159
SCOT IS GIGANTIC.

531
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:57,951
HE'S 6'11".

532
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,203
HE'S SO TALL.

533
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,746
370 POUNDS.

534
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,330
I THINK ALMOST THREE OF ME TO

535
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,290
MAKE ONE OF HIM, AND HE WEARS

536
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,959
SIZE 18 SHOES.

537
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,711
THAT'S AMAZING.

538
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,879
I NEED A BOOST.

539
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:13,133
I'VE DIDN'T DYING TO DO THIS.

540
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:13,884
>> GOOD?

541
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,552
>> TAI IS LIGHT AS A FEATHER.

542
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,679
I TOSSED HIM UP THE TREE AND

543
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,305
THAT LITTLE DUDE JUST RAN AROUND

544
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,724
THAT TREE PICKING MANGOES LIKE

545
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:20,933
CRAZY.

546
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,476
>> THIS IS FUN FOR ME.

547
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,145
I DON'T FEEL SCARED OR ANYTHING.

548
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,230
>> I HAVE MAN CRUSH ON TAI

549
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:26,480
ALREADY.

550
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,941
IN MY OPINION, HE'S NUMBER ONE

551
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,318
MOST VALUABLE MEMBER OF THE

552
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:31,693
TRIBE RIGHT NOW.

553
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,277
>> ONE MORE BRANCH.

554
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,612
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

555
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:33,904
RIGHT THERE.

556
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,573
>> IT'S AN EASY PICK.

557
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,202
>> OH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

558
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,788
>> IT'S EXCITING TO DO SOMETHING

559
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,080
NEW.

560
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:43,872
>> IT IS.

561
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,290
IT'S FUN NOW BECAUSE HONESTLY IT

562
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,166
WAS NICE TO BOND, BUT IT WAS

563
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,211
LIKE, OKAY, WHEN ARE WE GOING TO

564
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,587
PLAY?

565
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,130
I'M IN THE WORST SPOT EVER WITH

566
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,674
THIS EXTRA DYNAMIC OF JULIA

567
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,842
COMING BACK INTO THE MIX,

568
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,425
THERE'S NO WAY THAT BRAINS ARE

569
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,137
GOING TO KEEP BOTH BEAUTY, SO

570
00:18:59,221 --> 00:18:59,596
IT'S EITHER TAI OR I.

571
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,725
>> TAI, HE'S THE ONE THAT WAS

572
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,018
RUNNING AROUND WITH THE IDO.

573
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:05,936
TWICE WE CAUGHT HIM.

574
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,020
WE'RE LIKE, THIS GUY NEEDS TO

575
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:07,187
GO.

576
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,022
>> I'M A PROFESSIONAL POKER

577
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:09,231
PLAYER.

578
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,566
I PLAY A STRATEGY GAME FOR A

579
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:10,983
LIVING.

580
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:11,441
I KNOW HOW TO ADJUST.

581
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,988
I KNOW HOW TO HUSTLE.

582
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,281
I SAW HIM PATTING THE GROUND

583
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,740
WHERE THE TREES ARE.

584
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,367
I SAW HIM FIND THE ID.L. AND DIG

585
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:20,951
IT UP.

586
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,495
>> I'M NOT AFRAID TO THROW TAI

587
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,080
UNDER THE BUS TO PROTECT MYSELF

588
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,707
AND GET AS FAR AS I CAN IN THE

589
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:26,915
GAME.

590
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,500
>> I CAUGHT TAI TWICE LOOKING

591
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,713
FOR THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

592
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,506
AN I THOUGHT, CAN WE STICK

593
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:34,965
TOGETHER?

594
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,842
IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE, BUT I'M

595
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,426
NOT GOING TO GO OUT WITHOUT A

596
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:44,266
FIGHT.

597
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,729
>> WHAT DAY DO YOU GUY THINK IT

598
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,062
IS, 13?

599
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,814
>> THE TRIBE SWAP IS A REBIRTH

600
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,149
FOR ME.

601
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,817
THIS MIX OF BEAUTY, BRAIN AND

602
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,443
BRAWN, IT KIND OF MAKES THINGS

603
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,154
MORE SIMPLE.

604
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,238
IT'S TWO, TWO AND TWO.

605
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,406
SO IT'S GOING TO BE THE BATTLE

606
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,533
OF THE PAIRS.

607
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,952
I'M WITH MICHELE RIGHT NOW, AND

00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:18,967
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

615
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,928

00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,144
>> WHEN IT COMES TO BEING

622
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:30,354
MANIPULATIVE, I THINK I'M THE

623
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,355

00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,068
I GET TO START FRESH AND COME UP

00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,113
AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT.

628
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,990
>> I CAN PROBABLY GET MICHELE TO

629
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:42,658
BE ON BOARD.

630
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,076
IF YOU'RE ON BOARD WITH ME,

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,495
YOU'D BE GOOD WITH CYDNEY.

632
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,372

>> RIGHT.

639
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:56,505
I AGREE WITH THAT.

640
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,257
>> COMING TO THE NEW CHAN LOH

641
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,218
TRIBE, I WAS PUT IN A GOOD SPOT.

TOGETHER.

644
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,971
THE BRAINS ARE GOING TO STICK

645
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:04,513
TOGETHER, AND THEY'RE BOTH

646
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,765
REACHING FOR CYDNEY AND I.

647
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,558
BOTH SIDES LOOK AT US AS THAT

648
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,226
TIEBREAKER.

649
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,355
SO IT'S A GREAT SPOT TO BE IN.

650
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,232
BEAUTY ON THE RIGHT, BRAINS ON

651
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:15,524
THE LEFT.

652
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,318
WHO DO YOU SIDE WITH?

653
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,237
WE KIND OF HOLD ALL THE POWER.

654
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:37,129
SO I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD.

655
00:21:38,547 --> 00:22:02,571
AND I LIKE FELT MY BODY SHUTTING

656
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,449
DOWN.

657
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,035
I HAD NEVER FELT LIKE THAT

658
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:08,243
BEFORE.

659
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:11,455
IT WAS A COMBINATION OF

660
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,623
DEHYDRATION, BEING OUT HERE

661
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,461
ALONE AND PARANOIA.

662
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,171
AT THIS POINT THERE IS NO CHANCE

663
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,672
OF ME RECONNECTING WITH MY

664
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,757
ENTIRE ALLIANCE, SO IT'S GOING

665
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:30,682
TO BE HARD.

666
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,268
I WOULD SAY THAT RIGHT NOW BEING

667
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,145
OUT HERE ALONE IS THE HARDEST

668
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:39,232
PART OF MY GAME SO FAR.

669
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,819
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT I'M

670
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,279
ACTUALLY A TEEN, AND I THINK

671
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,990
IT'S EASIER FOR STRONGER PEOPLE,

672
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,283
BIGGER PEOPLE THAN ME, PEOPLE

673
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,994
WITH MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE THAN

674
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,081
ME TO HELP GET YOU THROUGH THIS.

675
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,457
ALL DAY ALL I'VE BEEN THINKING

676
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,126
ABOUT IS WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE

677
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,878
GOING ON BACK AT CAMP.

678
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,297
THE LONGER I'M OUT HERE, THE

679
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:08,178
MORE PARANOID I'M GOING TO GET.

680
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:35,705
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

681
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:35,997
OLD HABIT.

682
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,958

683
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,628
DIE HARD.

UNDONE.

735
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,617
HE'S GOING TO DO IT ALL HIMSELF

736
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,244
SCOT WORKING ON THAT SECOND SET.

>> NICK AND JASON GET CLOSER,

755
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:17,742
LESS RESISTANCE.

756
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,869

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,095
WE'RE VERY CLOSE.

794
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,098
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL FOUR TEAM,

795
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:22,932

RIGHT BEHIND THEM, THERE'S JOE

800

00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,816
THE GIRLS ARE DRAGGING THEM.

802
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,361
IT'S SO MUCH HEAVIER THAN YOU

803
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:34,903
CAN ANTICIPATE.

804
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,862
NOW IT'S GONDOL BACK IN THE

805
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,864

YOU'RE OUT.

812
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,082
NOW WE'RE TO THE FINAL STAGE.

813
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,377
IT IS DEBBIE AND NEAL AND IT IS

814
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,004
ANNA AND PETER.

815
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,881

GET THEM ALL ON THAT TABLE

817
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,009
BEFORE YOU START WORKING ON THE

818
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:58,385
PUZZLES.

819
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,636
BOTH GROUPS HAVE ALL THEIR

820
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,720
PIECES.

821
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,262
NOW YOU CAN START WORKING ON

822
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,263
THAT PUZZLE.

823
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:02,764
THIS IS IT.

824
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:07,185
>> COME ON, GUYS.

825
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,436
>> WE HAVE A BIG ONE.

826
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,314
>> OKAY.

827
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,149
>> Jeff: PETER'S HAD A LOT OF

828
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,317
SUCCESS ON PUZZLES.

829
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:14,734
SO HAS ANNA.

830
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,695
IT COULD BE A TIGHT DUO.

831
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,780
NEAL AND DEBBIE HAVE DONE A LOT

832
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,657
OF WORK ON PUZZLES.

833
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,199
>> NO.

834
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,535
>> Jeff: CHAN LOH HAS A LOT OF

835
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:23,827
PIECES DOWN.

836
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,161
THAT COULD BE A VERY GOOD THING

837
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,621
OR ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS.

838
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,289
YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU GET TO

839
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:28,915
THE END OF THE "SURVIVOR" PUZZLE

840
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,708
IF IT'S RIGHT OR NOT.

841
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,921
IT CAN FOOL YOU.

842
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,548
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

843
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,049
>> Jeff: NEAL AND DEBBIE

844
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,843
MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS.

845
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,678
IF THEY'RE RIGHT.

846
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,304
ANNA AND PETER ARE TAKING A LONG

847
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,431
TIME TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS AT

848
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,223
ALL.

849
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,559
>> GOOD COMMUNICATION.

850
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,185
GOOD COMMUNICATION.

851
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,894
>> Jeff: IS THAT IT?

852
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,770
>> WE GOT IT, JEFF.

853
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,981
>> Jeff: NEAL AND DEBBIE THINK

854
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,984
THEY HAVE IT.

855
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,112
IMMUNITY FOR CHAN LOH!

856
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,864
SENDING GONDOL TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

857
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,949
WHERE THE FIFTH PERSON WILL BE

858
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:07,162
VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

859
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,413
>> THAT WAS FAST.

860
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:08,872
>> Jeff: CHAN LOH,

861
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,873
CONGRATULATIONS.

862
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:14,127
IMMUNITY, NO TRIBAL COUNCIL,

863
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:14,502
NOBODY GOING HOME.

864
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,837
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

865
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,921
CAMP.

866
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,465
ALL RIGHT, GONDOL.

867
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,634
FOR ONE OF YOU, THIS IS IT.

868
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,260
TONIGHT SOMEBODY GOING HOME FROM

869
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,554

SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

875
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:29,309
COUNCIL.

876
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:29,851
>> AS SOON AS WE LOST THE

877
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,228
CHALLENGE, MY HEART SANK.

878
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,105
WE ARE GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,

879
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,857
AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A

880
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,191
BEAUTY PERSON.

881
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,444
>> IT'S A BATTLE OF ANNA VERSUS

882
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,320
TAI.

883
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:01,758
GUYS.

884
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:06,554
SORRY.

885
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,557
>> WE HAD A STRATEGY OF JUST

886
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,683
TAKING OUR TIME, FOCUS, GET IT

887
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:10,934
TOGETHER.

888
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,644
WE LOOK OVER AND THEY'RE DONE.

889
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:18,525
>> THEY WERE SO GOOD.

890
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,150
>> RIGHT NOW IT DEFINITELY COMES

891
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,152
DOWN TO ME AND ANNA TONIGHT.

892
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,028
>> I THOUGHT WE HAD A REALLY

893
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,321
GOOD CHANCE.

894
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,822
>> I HAVE THE IDOL.

895
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,324
I KNOW IF I PLAY THE IDOL, I

896
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,117
KNOW I WILL LAST ANOTHER DAY,

897
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,285
BUT I DON'T WANT THE PLAY THE

898
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:29,953
IDOL.

899
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,914
IF I DON'T PLAY IT, THEY MIGHT

900
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,209
BE ALL VOTING FOR ME.

901
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,210
MORE THAN ONCE.

902
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,044
MANY SURVIVORS GO HOME WITH THE

903
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:42,340
IDOL IN THEIR POCKET.

904
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,134
>> SO, GUYS AND GALS, WHAT DO

905
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:45,510
YOU THINK?

906
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,138
>> I THINK WE VOTE TAI TONIGHT.

907
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,015
>> YOU WANT THE PRIMARY PROVIDER

908
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,100
OUT?

909
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,143
>> THE OBJECTIVE IS TO GET ONE

910
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:54,894
BEAUTY OUT.

911
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,772
I PREFER ANNA BECAUSE SHE'S MORE

912
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:58,022
DIVISIVE.

913
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,107
THAT'S A GOOD ARGUMENT.

914
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,733
I'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

915
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,150
>> SURE.

916
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:01,901
I DON'T CARE.

917
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,945
>> I THINK THE ARGUMENT FOR ANNA

918
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,363
TO GO NOW IS BECAUSE SHE'S TOO

919
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,155
GOOD OF A PLAYER.

920
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,198
SHE'S A SCHEMER.

921
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,783
SHE'S INTELLIGENT, AND SHE'S A

922
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:09,701
VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

923
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,202
SHE CAN WIN PEOPLE OVER NOT ONLY

924
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,495
WITH HER BRAIN BUT WITH HER

925
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,124
LOOKS.

926
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,793
>> IF WE BASICALLY BLINDSIDE

927
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:19,919
ANNA, BECAUSE TAI IS REALLY GOOD

928
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,670
AT CAMP.

929
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,129
HE DOES EVERYTHING.

930
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,215
>> I SEE THE ARGUMENT BOTH WAYS.

931
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,010
>> DO WE WANT TO PROTECT THE

932
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,469
BRAINS OR NOT?

933
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,096
>> THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

934
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,015
>> WELL, IF WE DO, WE STILL HAVE

935
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,850
THREE AND TWO ON THE OTHER SIDE,

936
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,686
AND I KNOW SHE'S SWEET AND

937
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,563
EVERYTHING, BUT IF WE WANT TO

938
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,188
GET TO THE END, WE HAVE TO PLAY

939
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,607
THE GAME SMART.

940
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,482
>> OKAY.

941
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,066
>> I CAN COUNT ON YOU THEN?

942
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,028
>> I'M GOING TO GO ON YOU WITH

943
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,823
THIS ONE.

944
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:51,159
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

945
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,619
TONIGHT NOW THAT WE LOST?

946
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,455
>> WELL, THEY'RE TALKING GET ONE

947
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,998
OF THE BEAUTY OUT FOR NUMBERS.

948
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,374
>> I FIGURED.

949
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,667
>> IT'S PART OF THE GAME.

950
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,294
>> I DO NOT LIKE PETER.

951
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,003
THERE IS SOMETHING AR GABT ABOUT

952
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,421
PETER.

953
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,297
WE COULD TAKE PETER OUT.

954
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,049
I CAN DO IT BECAUSE I HAVE THE

955
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,634
IDOL.

956
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,094
>> SCOT?

957
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,471
>> YEAH.

958
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,598
DO YOU REALLY WANT PETER OUT?

959
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,891
THERE MIGHT BE A WAY.

960
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:15,725
>> HOW?

961
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,934
>> I HAVE THE IDOL.

962
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:17,393
I CAN PLAY IT.

963
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,853
>> YOU HAVE THE IDOL.

964
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:19,312
>> I HAVE THE IDOL.

965
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,104
WANT TO SEE IT?

966
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,439
>> YES.

967
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,775
>> YES.

968
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,193
>> I LOVE THIS.

969
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,320
>> WE CAN DO IT.

970
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:27,695
DO YOU WANT TO?

971
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,488
>> DONE.

972
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:28,696
>> DONE.

973
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,492
>> LET'S DO IT.

974
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,993
>> I LOVE "SURVIVOR."

975
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,246
I LOVE BLIND SIDES AND I LOVE

976
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,165
IMMUNITY IDOL, ESPECIALLY HIDDEN

977
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:39,374
ONES.

978
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,584
>> I'LL USE IT AND WE'LL ALL

979
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,251
VOTE FOR PETER.

980
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,961
I WANT THE TAKE PETER OUT AND WE

981
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:44,337
HAVE NUMBERS.

982
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,547
>> I WAS PETRIFIED, BUT TAI WILL

983
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,216
BE USING THE IDOL, SO WHOEVER IS

984
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,050
THE NEXT PERSON WHO HAS THE

985
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,219
HIGHER VOTE GOES HOME.

986
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,845
WHO IS THAT GOING TO BE?

987
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,765
IT'S GOING TO BE PETER.

988
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,976
>> SEE YOU LATER.

989
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,478
>> ONE OF US IS GOING HOME

990
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:05,608
TONIGHT.

991
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,694
>> THEY WANT TO GO ANNA.

992
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,403
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.

993
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,195
>> OKAY.

994
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,906
>> AUBRY CAME UP TO ME AND SAID,

995
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,033
TAI IS SAFE.

996
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,953
>> I'M GOING TO GO GET SOME

997
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,161
WATER.

998
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,955
>> SO WITH JASON, I HAVE TWO

999
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,123
GUYS THAT HAVE IDOLS, AND IF YOU

1000
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:24,752
PUT THEM TOGETHER, IT BECOMES

1001
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,130
SUPER IDOL, AND I THOUGHT, WOW,

1002
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,257
WE COULD BLIND SIDE ANNA AND

1003
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,216
KEEP THE IDOL HIDDEN, THAT WOULD

1004
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,510
MAKE ME THE ONLY PERSON IN THE

1005
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,095
GAME OF "SURVIVOR" THAT KNOWS

1006
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,472
WHERE THERE ARE TWO IDOLS.

1007
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,809
THAT PUTS ME IN, IN A GOOD SPOT

1008
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,560
PROVIDED I GET TO THE MERGE.

1009
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,520
>> WHAT IS THE BEST THING?

1010
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,230
>> THEY ARE VOTING ANNA OUT.

1011
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,273
I LIKE YOU.

1012
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,149
THEY LIKE YOU.

1013
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,192
NOBODY WANTS YOU TO GO.

1014
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,235
YOU'RE ASKING ME WHAT'S BEST FOR

1015
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:49,902
YOU.

1016
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,696
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU, I THINK, IS

1017
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,572
TO SAVE THE IDOL.

1018
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,239
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

1019
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,157
>> YES, OF COURSE.

1020
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,117
>> THEY'RE NOT VOTING YOU OUT

1021
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,617
TONIGHT, SO DON'T USE IT.

1022
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,911
>> SCOT SAID, MAYBE THEY'RE NOT

1023
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,121
GOING TO VOTE FOR ME AND I CAN

1024
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,123
USE THE IDOL AS A TOOL, BUT I'M

1025
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:06,377
SO WORRIED THAT IF I DON'T PLAY

1026
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,087
THE IDOL, I MIGHT GO HOME WITH

1027
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,547
THE IDOL IN MY POCKET, IN MY

1028
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,047
SHOE.

1029
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,340
THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE THING.

1030
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,176
>> YOU KNOW, TRIBAL COUNCIL IS

1031
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,220
LIKE HIGH SCHOOL PROM.

1032
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,431
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING

1033
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,640
TO GET OUT OF IT, BUT YOU'RE

1034
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,224
GOING TO FEEL SOMETHING.

1035
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,435
>> I CAN KEEP IT FOR MYSELF,

1036
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,644
SHARE WITH AN NARCOTIC I DON'T

1037
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,520
KNOW.

1038
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,481
I GUESS I'M BRINGING MY IDOL

1039
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,982
TONIGHT, AND I WANT TO SEE HOW

1040
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:28,316
IT PLAYS OUT.

1041
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,276
I THINK A LOT OF STUFF WILL

1042
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,863
PROBABLY COME UP AT TRIBAL, AND

1043
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,114
FROM THERELY DECIDE WHETHER TO

1044
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:43,623
PLAY IT OR NOT.

1045
00:34:45,666 --> 00:35:04,685
>> Jeff: ANNA AND TAI, AS IT

1046
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,270
IS YOUR FIRST TIME AT TRIBAL,

1047
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,022
THERE ARE TWO TORCHES BACK

1048
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,565
THERE, GRAB ONE, DIP IT IN AND

1049
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:13,319
GET FIRE.

1050
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,612
PART OF THE RITUAL OF TRIBAL

1051
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,905
COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS GAME,

1052
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,907
FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1053
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,158
WHEN YOU FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE

1054
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:25,123
YOU.

1055
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,834
SO AUBRY, LOOKING AT THE TRIBE

1056
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,628
DIVISION, IS IT FAIR TO SAY WITH

1057
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,672
THREE WRAINS, YOU, PETER AND JOE

1058
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,214
ARE STICKING TOGETHER IN.

1059
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:33,548
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1060
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,216
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WE KNOW,

1061
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,093
THE DEVILS WE KNOW, BUT WHEN YOU

1062
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,636
GO INTO A TRIBE SWAP, YOU WANT

1063
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,637
TO STICK TO THE NUMBERS.

1064
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,389
>> Jeff: SO, SCOT, THAT PUTS

1065
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,723
YOU IN AN INTERESTING SPOT.

1066
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,766
IT COULD BE GOOD.

1067
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,851
IT COULD BE TERRIBLE BECAUSE YOU

1068
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:45,226
HAVE NO BUDDY.

1069
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,396
>> I'M LITERALLY ALONE ON AN

1070
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,772
ISLAND, IF YOU WANT TO GO THERE,

1071
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,190
BUT PEOPLE HAVE TALKED TO ME AND

1072
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,483
THEY'VE MADE ME PART OF THEIR

1073
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,401
GROUP FOR NOW, AND WE'LL SEE

1074
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,988
WHAT HAPPENS.

1075
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,489
>> Jeff: ANNA, WHAT WAS YOUR

1076
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,866
FEELING, KNOWING I'M NOT ON THE

1077
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,200
BOTTOM BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT IN

1078
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:01,951
THE POWER SPOT.

1079
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,870
>> AUTOMATICALLY MY HEART

1080
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,078
DROPPED.

1081
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,454
I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS.

1082
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,706
MY FIRST THOUGHT IS THERE IS A

1083
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,291
GOOD CHANCE IF WE LOSE IMMUNITY,

1084
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,501
IT WILL BE TAI OR I.

1085
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,961
THAT'S WHAT I FEEL LIKE NOW.

1086
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,296
>> Jeff: TAI, DO YOU FEEL THE

1087
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,046
SAME WAY?

1088
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,798
DO YOU THINK IT'S YOU OR AN IN?

1089
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,216
>> I AGREE COMPLETELY.

1090
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,759
THESE ARE THE BRAINS.

1091
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,470
THESE ARE THE SMART PEOPLE.

1092
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,139
THEY HAVE THREE.

1093
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,140
WE HAVE TWO.

1094
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:24,765
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP

1095
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,393
SCOT BECAUSE HE'S MASSIVE, A

1096
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:31,314
HUGE ASSET TO THE CHALLENGES.

1097
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,774
>> Jeff: ANNA, WHAT DO YOU DO?

1098
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,526
>> I CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES,

1099
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,569
IT'S WHATEVER THE BRAINS AND

1100
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:36,861
SCOT DECIDE.

1101
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,362
IT'S 50/50.

1102
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,822
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

1103
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,656
KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG.

1104
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,366
I MIGHT NOT HAVE BIG GUN, BUT MY

1105
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,993
LEGS ARE STRONG.

1106
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,703
YOU KNOW, I'M COMPETITIVE.

1107
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,872
SO HOPEFULLY THEY SEE ME AS AN

1108
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,915
ASSET AND KEEP MY AROUND A

1109
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,291
LITTLE LONGER.

1110
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,919
>> AND I HATE THAT WE'RE

1111
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:53,628
DISCUSSING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE

1112
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,795
HAVE A GREAT CONNECTION.

1113
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,547
AND I'M PLAYING EVERYTHING VERY

1114
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,381
STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH YOU GUYS,

1115
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,592
YOU KNOW, AND I ALWAYS WORK.

1116
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,427
I'M THE ONE THAT WORKS.

1117
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,846
I'M THE ONE THAT DISCOVERS

1118
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,347
EDIBLE FOOD.

1119
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,100
THE REASON I SCRAPE UP TREE, I

1120
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,477
CLIMB MANGO TREES TO GET MANGOES

1121
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:09,810
FOR THE TRIBE.

1122
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,103
YOU CAN SEE IT.

1123
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,230
IT'S FORMING A SCAB ALREADY.

1124
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,105
>> Jeff: I BELIEVE YOU.

1125
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,024
>> I'M NOT HURT.

1126
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,818
EVEN WITH THIS THING... EVEN

1127
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,403
WITH THIS THING, I HAVE A LOT OF

1128
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,031
SKILLS, A LOT OF RESOURCES, AND

1129
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,283
I NEVER EVER COMPLAIN ABOUT

1130
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,744
WORK, NEVER.

1131
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,037
>> Jeff: AUBRY, DO YOU

1132
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,288
APPRECIATE THE FACT YOU HAVE TWO

1133
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:29,830
VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, AND

1134
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,832
THEY'RE BOTH MAKING THEIR CASE

1135
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,626
FROM THEIR OWN PERSONALITY?

1136
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,045
>> QUITE HONESTLY, IT'S HARD TO

1137
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,129
HEAR BECAUSE THEY'RE PUTTING IT

1138
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,297
ALL ON THE TABLE, AND I

1139
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,382
APPRECIATE IT, BUT WE'RE GOING

1140
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,716
TO HAVE TO MAKE A TOUGH

1141
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,425
DECISION.

1142
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,762
>> Jeff: JOE, HAS THE TOPIC OF

1143
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,262
IDOLS COME UP.

1144
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,598
>> WELL, MY PERSONAL BELIEF, YOU

1145
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,933
ALWAYS SAY THERE IS A TWIST.

1146
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,309
I THINK THE TWIST IS THERE WAS

1147
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,769
NO TWIST ABOUT AN IDOL.

1148
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,603
>> Jeff: MEANING THERE ISN'T

1149
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:52,937
ONE?

1150
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,396
>> THERE IS NOT ONE.

1151
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,190
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BY NOW

1152
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:56,732
THERE WOULD BE A CUE.

1153
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,525
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND WE'RE

1154
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,069
MOVING ON IN THE GAME.

1155
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,112
PI PERSONAL BELIEF IS THERE IS

1156
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,154
NOT ONE.

1157
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:02,697
>> Jeff: TAI, DO YOU BELIEVE

1158
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,615
IT'S POSSIBLE THERE ARE ACTUALLY

1159
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,408
NO IDOLS OUT HERE?

1160
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,243
>> I DON'T THINK SO EITHER

1161
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,619
BECAUSE I LOOKED AND I GOT IN

1162
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,413
TROUBLE FROM THE BEAUTY TRIBE.

1163
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,456
AND ACTUALLY I'M TERRIBLE ABOUT

1164
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,249
LOOKING FOR STUFF.

1165
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,667
I HAVE A BAD SENSE OF DIRECTION,

1166
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,544
SO I NEVER FIND IT, AND THERE'S

1167
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,378
IN CLUE.

1168
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,796
SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN IDOL

1169
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,547
OUT THERE.

1170
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,341
>> Jeff: SO SCOT, IF IT'S TRUE

1171
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,011
THAT IT'S PETER, AUBRY AND JOE

1172
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,221
VERSUS ANNA AND TAI, YOU HAVE

1173
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:27,430
OPTIONS.

1174
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,432
>> WELL, POSSIBLY.

1175
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,474
BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW TIGHT

1176
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,351
THE BRAINS ARE.

1177
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,645
>> Jeff: PETER, SCOT BRINGS UP

1178
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,022
AN INTERESTING POINT.

1179
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,648
DID YOU SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO

1180
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,483
FIGURE OUT IF THERE ARE CRACKS

1181
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,860
BETWEEN YOU AND AUBRY AND JOE?

1182
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,903
>> NOT TODAY.

1183
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,031
BUT TO BE HONEST, JEFF, I'M NOT

1184
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:45,865
CONCERNED BECAUSE I'M IN A

1185
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,449
POSITION OF POWER.

1186
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,576
THE BRAINS AND SCOT, WE'RE IN

1187
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,243
THE POWER POSITION.

1188
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:51,078
WE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT RIGHT NOW

1189
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,121
AND WE'RE GOING TO.

1190
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,456
>> Jeff: BUT PETER, THE

1191
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,415
HARDEST THING ABOUT TRIBAL IS

1192
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,793
YOU CAN'T EVER TRUST A SINGLE

1193
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,545
THING YOU'RE HEARING FROM ANYONE

1194
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,755
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

1195
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,464
STORY IT IS THEY WANT YOU TO

1196
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,424
BELIEVE IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

1197
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,551
>> THAT'S THE IRONY.

1198
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,053
TRIBAL COUNCIL IS ITS OWN LITTLE

1199
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:07,303
UNIVERSE.

1200
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,221
THE WORDS OUT OF OUR MOUTHS

1201
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,097
AREN'T NECESSARILY THE TRUTH.

1202
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,474
>> Jeff: SO WHAT'S THE

1203
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,434
LIKELIHOOD THAT ANNA, TAI AND

1204
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,103
SCOT DECIDE WE'RE DEAD IF WE

1205
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:16,729
DON'T TAKE THESE THREE BRAINS ON

1206
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,147
RIGHT NOW TONIGHT?

1207
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,984
>> LIKELIHOOD LOW, VERY LOW.

1208
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,527
>> Jeff: AUBRY, THE REASON I

1209
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,780
ASK IS, IF YOU'RE SITTING WHERE

1210
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,989
I AM, THE THREE OF YOU ARE

1211
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:27,406
THREE.

1212
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,532
THERE'S TWO AND THERE'S ONE.

1213
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,242
SO IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA TO MAKE

1214
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:30,785
ANOTHER THREE AND SAY, LET'S

1215
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,788
JUST GO FOR BROKE.

1216
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,413
>> THAT COULD DEFINITELY BE A

1217
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,790
POSSIBILITY.

1218
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,123
YOU SEE THREE.

1219
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,541
YOU FEEL LIKE THESE PEOPLE ARE

1220
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:37,833
TIGHT.

1221
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,919
IF YOU'RE IN A DESPERATE

1222
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:40,795
SITUATION, SOME PEOPLE WOULD GO

1223
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,423
FOR IT.

1224
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:44,840
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1225
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,967
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1226
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,594
ANNA.

1227
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:55,810
YOU'RE UP.

1228
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:23,921
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1229
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:27,133
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1230
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:27,716
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1231
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:36,767
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1232
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,562
OKAY.

1233
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,147
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1234
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,605
DECISION IS FINAL.

1235
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,898
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1236
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,733
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1237
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,401
IMMEDIATELY.

1238
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,486
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1239
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,866
FIRST VOTE PETER.

1240
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,576
ANNA.

1241
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,411
ANNA.

1242
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,831
TWO VOTES ANNA.

1243
00:40:58,914 --> 00:40:59,039
ANNA.

1244
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,041
THAT'S THREE VOTES ANNA, ONE

1245
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,753
VOTE PETER.

1246
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,882
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT, ANNA.

1247
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,633
THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH.

1248
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:21,687
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1249
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,024
ANNA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1250
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,026
>> GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE.

1251
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:36,118
>> Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1252
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:38,579
WELL, "SURVIVOR" IS A GAME ABOUT

1253
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,747
DECISIONS.

1254
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,082
TONIGHT YOU DECIDED TO KEEP TAI

1255
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,167
OVER ANNA, AND THE QUESTION

1256
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,543
YOU'RE GOING TO BE WRESTLING

1257
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,712
WITH UNTIL THE NEXT IMMUNITY

1258
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,714
CHALLENGE, DID WE MAKE THE RIGHT

1259
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:48,964
DECISION?

1260
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,758
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1261
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,509
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1262
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,888
GOOD NIGHT.

1263
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,405
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1264
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,698
"SURVIVOR," DEBBIE IS COURTING A

1265
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,074
NEW ALLEY.

1266
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:15,658
>> ONE OF MY STRATEGIES IS NOT

1267
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,202
TO BE A FLIRT, BUT I THINK NICK

1268
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,538
LOOKS LIKE A GREEK GOD.

1269
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,081
>> Jeff: WHILE JOE

1270
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:22,623
INVESTIGATES ONE OF HIS OWN.

1271
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,583
>> ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ME OUT?

1272
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:24,833
DON'T LIE.

1273
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,213
I'M RETIRED F.B.I.

1274
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:29,964
I'M TRAINED TO DEAL WITH

1275
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,758
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.

1276
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,510
>> OH, MY GOD, THIS HURTS SO

1277
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:34,718
MUCH.

1278
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,512
I DID NOT EXPECT TO BE OUT THIS

1279
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:36,804
EARLY.

1280
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,138
I THOUGHT I WAS POLITICIAN A

1281
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:38,806
PRETTY GOOD GAME, BUT MAYBE I

1282
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,100
WAS PLAYING A LITTLE TOO HARD.

1283
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,184
BUT THAT WAS MY STRATEGY.

1284
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:42,726
I WAS GOING TO GO ALL IN.

1285
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,646
I WAS GOING TO GO WITH MY GUT.

1286
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,314
WHEN TAI SHOWED ME THE IDOL, I

1287
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,732
THOUGHT, OH, MY GOD, WE'RE GOING

1288
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,860
TO BLIND SIDE PETER, BUT HE

1289
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:52,945
BLIND SIDED ME.
