1
00:00:00,676 --> 00:00:03,053
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:06,039
Andrea. For victory.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:10,252
The Tavua won their second immunity challenge.

4
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:11,778
And there was a surprise

5
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:13,765
for the two losing tribes.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,158
In a single group, you will eliminate one person.

7
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:22,597
At the council,

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,041
it was total chaos.

9
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,692
What is this bronx, Jeff?

10
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,436
Oh my God!

11
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,972
JT leaked the Nuku plan.

12
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,440
They vote Sierra.

13
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:35,168
And Tai used it to his advantage...

14
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:37,037
I would like to give the idol to...

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,371
The pretty lady!

16
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:42,183
...saving the Mana tribe...

17
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,052
Sierra. Does not count.

18
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,449
...and eliminating Malcolm.

19
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:48,990
There are 16 left.

20
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,915
Who will be eliminated tonight?

21
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,393
How come

22
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,506
that Tai just gives the idol to Sierra?

23
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,632
I do not know.

24
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:08,870
I just said to Brad, "You're safe." Why Malcolm?

25
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:10,177
I would like to know.

26
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:12,080
But when Hali...

27
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,049
When she talked about physical threats,

28
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,646
it made me nervous.

29
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:18,312
No, Culpepper told you it was safe.

30
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:20,246
And I told him the same thing.

31
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,057
What else did you tell him?

32
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:24,793
I said fuck off Culpepper about our vote.

33
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,074
The advice couldn't have gone worse for me.

34
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,198
I told Brad Sierra was in danger.

35
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,673
And to play the idol, if they had it.

36
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,919
I saw it as a great opportunity to get Sandra out.

37
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:39,142
Alas, they took out our strongest player, Malcolm.

38
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,475
He was my closest friend in this tribe.

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,511
So I have to cut corners

40
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,747
my best, and move on.

41
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:49,551
Somehow that name got leaked,

42
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:53,613
for why would Tai have chosen her?

43
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:56,798
I freaked out when I thought Culpepper had an idol.

44
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,994
They can't prove what I said.

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,121
So I'm going to defend myself, thoroughly.

46
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,795
I will never tell them.

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,532
I'm here to make a million.

48
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,212
Tai turned around and Culpepper said, "Sierra."

49
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:10,415
Sierra did like that, took it and put it around her neck.

50
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,874
I told him he was safe. I'm pissed.

51
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,609
It's signed JT.

52
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,302
It's a dirty JT trick.

53
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,380
And if he knows me,

54
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,467
I'll turn around and send him home

55
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:22,442
right behind Malcolm, if I may.

56
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:25,253
He upset my plans. It's time for revenge.

57
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,146
The advice was very rough for me.

58
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:37,490
my biggest fear

59
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,225
is that if we lose immunity,

60
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:41,628
it might well be me.

61
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,472
I have to find an idol.

62
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,900
It's ugly, but it's true.

63
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,112
I'm afraid to stick my hands in here.

64
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:04,679
Name of...

65
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:07,083
I have a thing.

66
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,488
I have a thing.

67
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:11,584
"Finding safety requires coordination."

68
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,418
Surprise, I found a clue!

69
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:15,770
He says, "Finding safety requires

70
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,205
to find the intersection of landmarks on your range.

71
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,157
Seek casually or desperately.

72
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:22,075
Your protection is at hand."

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,478
Great news!

74
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,629
I saw the marked trees.

75
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,874
As soon as they're all gone

76
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:30,076
in two minutes, it's over.

77
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,215
I got it.

78
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:39,839
We cover...

79
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:44,933
Surprise, I found the idol!

80
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,624
And no one knows. Perfect, that's what I need.

81
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:50,317
"Congratulations! You have found the Hidden Immunity Idol."

82
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:51,948
I won't tell anyone.

83
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:53,575
And she will allow me to stay.

84
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Splendid! Thanks.

85
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:57,087
Oui!

86
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,437
Survivor Game Changers Season 34 Episode 04 Dirty Trick

87
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,533
Over here, everyone!

88
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,711
Tavua, discover the new Mana tribe.

89
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,856
Full!

90
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:33,206
Still intact. What is this bronx?

91
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:36,251
Byte, Discover la nouvelle tribu Nuku.

92
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:37,502
Quoi?!

93
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,259
Malcolm was eliminated at the last council.

94
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:43,683
Oh my God!

95
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,894
Ozzy. Why is Malcolm significant?

96
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,400
Malcolm is a huge, huge player.

97
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,194
That he left at this point,

98
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,913
it changes the game.

99
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:58,873
Ready for today's reward event?

100
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:00,859
Today,

101
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:04,486
each tribe will use a grappling hook to retrieve a bow.

102
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:07,304
Then you will dig up a bag containing a ball.

103
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:10,785
With the ball balanced on the arc, you will cross obstacles.

104
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:14,627
You will place the ball on arrival, and it starts again.

105
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:17,827
With the grappling hook, you will collect a bag containing a support.

106
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:19,486
You will dig up another ball.

107
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:21,867
The ball balanced on the support,

108
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:23,656
you will overcome the same obstacles.

109
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,634
Once the two balls arrive,

110
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,603
a person will solve a sliding puzzle.

111
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:32,060
The first two tribes to finish win a reward.

112
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,943
Want to know what's at stake? Yes!

113
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,063
Peanut butter and jam!

114
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:42,284
Peanut butter/jam sandwiches,

115
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,335
plus cookies and milk.

116
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,654
Oh my God!

117
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,314
For the second... My mouth is watering.

118
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,777
We don't forget you.

119
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:51,084
Just a sample.

120
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,387
Peanut butter and jam.

121
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:56,089
Oh my God!

122
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:57,657
For the last...

123
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:58,783
Nothing.

124
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:02,112
Tavua, you are one more. Who will not participate?

125
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,238
Troyzan.

126
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,092
Troyzan. Take a seat on the bench.

127
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:07,801
The others, a minute of organization and we begin.

128
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:14,203
I'm very quick with sliding puzzles.

129
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:16,218
I do it all the time on my phone.

130
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,877
Grapple or dig? Choose. You choose.

131
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:21,723
Choose. I will go. Where are you the best?

132
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,017
I'll dig up those fucking bags, come on!

133
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,728
I have a very good sense of balance.

134
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,521
OK, so you do this. You, the support.

135
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:30,123
You, the bow. You dig.

136
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:31,925
OK. Understood.

137
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:35,661
Well, on and go.

138
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:38,164
For a reward of peanut butter and jelly,

139
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:39,524
cookies and milk.

140
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,767
Survivors, ready?

141
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,070
Go!

142
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:46,339
It will be Sarah,

143
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:47,883
Warns

144
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:48,875
and Sierra

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,203
with the grapples.

146
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,444
First task,

147
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:52,900
hang that bow.

148
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:54,948
A bit short for Sarah. One should understand

149
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:56,549
how to use this rope.

150
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,254
Sierra has the bow, on her second throw.

151
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,389
Good job!

152
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:04,157
Tai will dig up the first ball.

153
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,171
Sarah hung up her bow.

154
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,299
Now Cirie digs up the ball for Tavua.

155
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,912
I got it! Tai has the ball for Mana.

156
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,172
It's Hali for the balance part.

157
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:21,188
Hali is in the lead.

158
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:23,229
She advances on the first obstacle.

159
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:25,145
She loses her ball and has to start over.

160
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,970
Varner is still trying to snag that bow.

161
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:29,749
Varner hooks it up for Nuku!

162
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:32,735
Now Michaela digs up the ball.

163
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,932
Michaela flips the beach!

164
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:41,770
Michaela, record time for Nuku's ball!

165
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,417
Go on, Cirie! That's it!

166
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,107
Cirie has the ball for Tavua.

167
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,394
JT takes off.

168
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:50,711
This is Hali,

169
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,948
progressing over the first hurdle.

170
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,551
Ozzy doesn't hesitate.

171
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:59,703
Like he grew up doing that in the jungle!

172
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:02,412
It gives Tavua the advantage.

173
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:04,515
Take your time, you're ahead!

174
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,696
Ozzy cleared the first hurdle very easily.

175
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:10,636
Ozzy is on the second obstacle.

176
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,701
Ozzy has passed!

177
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,770
Bring the ball to the finish, hook the next bag!

178
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:18,077
Tavua took the lead.

179
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:19,908
Nice throw from Sarah.

180
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,003
Sarah quickly grabs that bag for Tavua.

181
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:26,081
Cirie will dig up the second ball.

182
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,326
Hali has passed!

183
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,810
She attacks the second section.

184
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:35,323
JT made it through the first part.

185
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,183
Hali and JT face off.

186
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:41,463
JT loses his ball. He has to start over.

187
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,119
Hali took the hit.

188
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:45,294
It's not moving this time.

189
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:48,661
And it worked! Hali, drop the ball!

190
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:51,373
Go ahead, Mana!

191
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:55,343
Sierra attempts to grab the bracket.

192
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:59,080
Cirie is still looking for the ball.

193
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,007
Sierra l'a eu.

194
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:03,585
Tai goes for the second ball.

195
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,780
Both Tai and Cirie look for the second ball.

196
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,014
I got it!

197
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,625
Tai quickly finds the ball for Mana.

198
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,048
And here are the Mana in the lead!

199
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,131
Cirie finally has the ball for Tavua.

200
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,300
Debbie is on the course for Mana

201
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,592
with stand

202
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:22,103
and Andrea for Tavua.

203
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:25,307
Andrea passed the first section,

204
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,641
very quickly!

205
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:30,737
Debbie had taken the lead, but she lost it.

206
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:34,783
Big fall for JT.

207
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,486
Debbie is still struggling.

208
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,121
Go ahead, JT! Go ahead, my hen!

209
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,690
Come on, JT!

210
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,115
Well done, JT!

211
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,383
Andrea, it's good!

212
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:45,758
JT, it's good!

213
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,355
Go-y, the Nuku! Go-y, the Tavua!

214
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,258
The Tavua can attack the sliding puzzle.

215
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,835
And Varner can try

216
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,341
to hang this bag.

217
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,606
Varner snags the bag for Nuku!

218
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:00,442
Michaela digs again.

219
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:03,066
Can she do it as fast as last time?

220
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:05,138
Yes, I can! Yes, she can!

221
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:06,306
Go for it!

222
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:09,376
The door remains wide open for the Tavua.

223
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:11,611
That leaves Zeke plenty of time

224
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,321
to attack this puzzle.

225
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,215
He placed himself in the role of the hero.

226
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,490
Can he insure?

227
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,685
Debbie finally clears the first hurdle.

228
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,688
The pressure is on Aubry.

229
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,099
Debbie loses her balls. She has to start over.

230
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,291
Aubry...

231
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,761
It's good, Aubry! Aubry passed the first section.

232
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,362
Now,

233
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:30,945
Debbie and Aubry face off.

234
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,415
Together in their first season, they are now opposites.

235
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,099
Can they catch Zeke?

236
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:38,580
Come on, Aubry, come on!

237
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,706
Come on, Debbie!

238
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:41,950
Nope! Debbie has to start over.

239
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,378
Its good! It's good for Aubry!

240
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:46,703
In the hole!

241
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,748
So! Go for it!

242
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,426
Nuku can attack their sliding puzzle.

243
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:53,787
Sandra will take care of it,

244
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,630
confronting Zeke.

245
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,105
The Mana were leading, but they are dead last.

246
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,736
Debbie loses her ball again.

247
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,362
She wasted a lot of time.

248
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:04,597
Stay calm!

249
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,777
The Tavua are getting closer to victory.

250
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:09,778
Oui!

251
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,271
Zeke thinks it's good.

252
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,143
Zeke earns the reward for Tavua!

253
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,014
There is one place left.

254
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,992
Sandra is on the sliding puzzle for Nuku,

255
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:27,395
as Debbie still tries to clear the hurdle

256
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,521
for Mana.

257
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,487
Debbie fails again.

258
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:32,959
She insisted on doing it, right? I say.

259
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:34,803
It slips too much, damn it!

260
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:38,865
That's it! Sandra thinks it's good.

261
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:40,879
And it is!

262
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,078
Nuku wins the reward!

263
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,237
Mana will leave empty-handed.

264
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:47,394
Yes! You finished it!

265
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm tired of losing again.

266
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:50,844
Me too.

267
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,198
Tavua, congratulations!

268
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:56,875
Come get your reward.

269
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,361
Peanut butter and jam, cookies and milk.

270
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,332
Nuku. Come get your reward.

271
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:06,126
As long as there isn't an even number, it would be an odd one!

272
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,199
Mana, I have nothing for you. Take your things, return to camp.

273
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:15,591
Once again we lost.

274
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:17,608
We don't organize.

275
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:20,348
It's a dictatorship, in which Brad

276
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,385
decides who will do what.

277
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,260
I have a very good sense of balance.

278
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:26,818
OK, so you do this.

279
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:28,643
Overall, I'm pissed off.

280
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,666
Nice job, friends!

281
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,891
To Tavua! Health! To Tavua!

282
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:41,829
Health! Good game!

283
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:43,939
Nice job, friends! Nice balance, Ozzy!

284
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,065
syllable,

285
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,633
literally gone

286
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:47,876
You're welcome,

287
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,378
knew how to make the mayonnaise take,

288
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,306
and there, we dominate.

289
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,708
Peanut butter in Survivor is gold.

290
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,412
But I don't want to be overconfident.

291
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:01,014
In case something crazy happens,

292
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,739
I need options.

293
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,157
What do you have in mind, Troy?

294
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:13,502
I do not know. I feel at the bottom of the scale.

295
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,277
Has anyone spoken to you? No.

296
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:18,038
I only trust you in this tribe.

297
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:21,826
Pretend to do something or they'll be suspicious.

298
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:24,282
At this stage,

299
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,806
Troyzan is alone against me and the other four.

300
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,241
But this concrete quartet,

301
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:31,216
it's stupid. It sucks. I do not like it.

302
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,621
Grandissons.

303
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:33,747
Go on.

304
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:36,783
I'm testing the waters, do we trust each other, you and me?

305
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:39,670
If you're talking about our discussion,

306
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,988
you are dead and so am I.

307
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,500
I'm playing like a delinquent this time.

308
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,956
I know how delinquents lie to me.

309
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:50,296
So I know how to lie to these people.

310
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,340
I will look for an idol.

311
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,313
But don't ever trick me!

312
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:57,003
No. Why would I? Good. I tell you, that's all.

313
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,250
I have an idol. And Sarah doesn't know.

314
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,444
And she says she wants to work with me.

315
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:03,718
It would be

316
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,265
a huge plus for my game

317
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,224
not to play my idol right away.

318
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:10,292
If I could work with her and keep my idol...

319
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,778
High five? Yeah.

320
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:13,228
100 %.

321
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,354
It would be...

322
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:17,232
Le ticket d'or!

323
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,501
Debbie, how are you?

324
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:30,915
Debbie, talk with us! Debbie!

325
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:34,559
Speak, you four,

326
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:36,573
decide some stuff and then tell me.

327
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:39,433
And when you kill me, give my clothes to Hali too.

328
00:14:39,558 --> 00:14:40,989
Come here, Debbie! Come!

329
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,682
I think she is very angry.

330
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:43,957
She laughs?

331
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:47,120
No, I think she's pissed. I do not know.

332
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,057
Are you going to talk to him? Yeah.

333
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:53,602
Today, in the test,

334
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,310
Hali rocked on the beam.

335
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:58,298
But Debbie couldn't make it, we lost the peanut butter.

336
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:00,500
And she insisted on doing it.

337
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,110
But there, she is very angry.

338
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,321
So I don't know what she wants.

339
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,616
The only predictable thing about Debbie is her unpredictability.

340
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,329
How are you? I worry. Yep I'm fine.

341
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:12,026
Don't worry. It rolls between us.

342
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:14,523
I know, but... I'm fucked, bottom rung,

343
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,254
speechless for Brad,

344
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,314
so might as well close it

345
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:21,651
and listen to what I am told, what I will do.

346
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:24,432
Brad treats me with very little respect.

347
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,450
He's used to being the boss.

348
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,456
At football, in his law firm, in his family,

349
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:31,106
Brad is the boss.

350
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:34,609
It's just that, total disrespect to me.

351
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:36,444
What you want, you get it.

352
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,897
He licks your feet so much that you're only left with the bones.

353
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:42,467
Who, Brad?

354
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:44,815
If Hali wants to go on the beam,

355
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,571
even if she makes us lose the peanut butter/jam

356
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,716
hanging around for ten fucking minutes

357
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:52,639
and that I flew over this beam in 30 seconds,

358
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,641
it means you don't respect me.

359
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:57,496
It's disgusting, frustrating,

360
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,021
and I'm pissed!

361
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,754
What you want, you get it.

362
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,237
If I say something, I'm ignored.

363
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:07,576
Debbie's outburst about Brad

364
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:11,580
revolved around the fact of not having been listened to at the test.

365
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,376
It escapes me a bit.

366
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:15,372
I think Brad is great in events.

367
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:18,223
He's a leader, he brings people together.

368
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:21,883
But for her, I'm the princess who can do everything

369
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,351
and she the ghoul who has no right to anything.

370
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:25,630
It rolls between us.

371
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:28,255
It's him. I can't take it anymore.

372
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,931
Brad? Yeah.

373
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,500
I know, he doesn't show you much respect.

374
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,036
None! None!

375
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:36,354
None!

376
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,964
Not a little, none!

377
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:40,501
I wanted to comfort her,

378
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,470
but to see her get upset like this, I was really scared.

379
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:45,259
She's just different, I think.

380
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:46,605
She looks crazy.

381
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,261
Princess Hali, what she wants, she gets!

382
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:52,051
"She's good on the beam!" She cost us the reward!

383
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:53,914
Debbie thinks she's an expert in everything.

384
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,582
But Hali is better than her,

385
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:57,792
in terms of agility

386
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,067
in the trials.

387
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:01,756
When your word is not kept at all,

388
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:03,944
why not shut up and shut up?

389
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,172
I understand. No problem. OK.

390
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,063
I don't explode in anger.

391
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:14,085
I let off steam by doing my gym.

392
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,203
Hence that physique and those abs.

393
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:19,332
Because I don't get angry.

394
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:22,108
Now, and that's it. I evacuate, and it will be over.

395
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:25,566
I will make a strategic and thoughtful decision,

396
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,746
and it could be him.

397
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:31,159
I'd rather die fighting than live on my knees.

398
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,241
So it seems quite relevant to me.

399
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:37,299
to make Mr. Blah-blah-blah-Brad

400
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,874
my next target.

401
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,188
Debbie, excuse me.

402
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:44,525
I don't think you even realize it.

403
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,908
Used to being the boss,

404
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,101
you don't see that this is not a discussion.

405
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:52,076
At least not with me. It is a dictatorship.

406
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:55,150
And the funny thing is, I was supporting you.

407
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,101
I am loyal. I was totally loyal to you.

408
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:00,076
And you broke my heart!

409
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,359
Why not take out Brad? He's a wanker.

410
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,636
May the best remain.

411
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:08,021
Come on, Brad!

412
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:09,246
Come!

413
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,640
They make coffee.

414
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:32,873
Is there enough for me to take the leftovers?

415
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:35,825
Put seven drops of coffee with a spoonful of sugar.

416
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,059
Seven drops of coffee and a spoonful of sugar?

417
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:38,977
Sure!

418
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:41,953
Michaela would like seven drops of coffee

419
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:44,257
and a spoonful of sugar, to try.

420
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:45,492
Seven drops?

421
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:47,894
Ignorance, that's what it is.

422
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,193
Spoon, my ass.

423
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:52,508
Of ignorance.

424
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:56,878
Michaela begins to lose her bearings.

425
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,681
She is already a little perched, unstable.

426
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,412
Yesterday was a bit hard to manage, to the test.

427
00:19:03,537 --> 00:19:06,179
No one likes babysitting in a survival situation.

428
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:10,924
And there she wants seven drops of coffee in a spoonful of sugar.

429
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,294
Is beyond me.

430
00:19:17,348 --> 00:19:18,349
I like!

431
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:21,570
JT was unhappy with Michaela using

432
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:25,258
a spoonful of sugar for a mini-sip of coffee.

433
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,634
So I had a great idea.

434
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,444
I said to myself,

435
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,071
"I'm going to eat the rest of the sugar."

436
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:34,182
That's what's left of sugar? I will finish it.

437
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,335
It'll make things worse, he'll think it was Michaela.

438
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:41,280
Only JT and Michaela use sugar.

439
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,684
So I knew JT would blame Michaela

440
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,720
that the sugar pot is empty.

441
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:51,466
There is no more sugar!

442
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,151
I know who ate it.

443
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,926
And by the spoonful.

444
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:57,105
Michaela.

445
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,833
Where did he go? In his mouth!

446
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,710
Tongue cleaned.

447
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:02,935
I believe you.

448
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,471
The sugar is gone!

449
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,132
How could he disappear so quickly?

450
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:10,151
JT thinks it's Michaela.

451
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,945
But it's 100% Sandra!

452
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,444
I don't eat it, so...

453
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:15,622
I say. Neither do I. But someone is eating it.

454
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:23,689
Who could drink all the coffee with sugar?

455
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:26,722
Do you sweeten your coffee? I drank lots of coffee.

456
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,699
It must be you two.

457
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:30,890
Because Sandra doesn't drink it.

458
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:36,665
It's no secret, darling. It doesn't matter.

459
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:40,582
JT acted like I took the sugar.

460
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,772
I was furious.

461
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:44,886
And the problem, with me,

462
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:48,189
is that the more I try to contain myself,

463
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,725
the worse it gets, and in this environment,

464
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,552
we contain, contain, contain...

465
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:54,804
But I wanted to kill him.

466
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:19,949
I sense the tension in the Mana tribe.

467
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:22,082
Now I don't know where I belong.

468
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:23,971
I have to consider

469
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,962
what is best for me.

470
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:30,142
I used the idol on the board.

471
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:32,826
I think there must be a new one.

472
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:35,295
I want to be productive and go get her.

473
00:21:38,914 --> 00:21:41,977
Even if they think I'm sneaking around, at least

474
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,204
I feel like I'm in control of my game.

475
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,772
It's so hard to find. The jungle is big.

476
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,501
Oh my God!

477
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,161
I found another clue.

478
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:11,216
"To find the idol that can save your game,

479
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:13,201
you will need to submerge a wooden board.

480
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:16,149
When your tribe's emblem magically appears,

481
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:19,199
dig underneath and see if you've hit the nail on the head."

482
00:22:19,762 --> 00:22:21,624
I'm not going to look for her right away.

483
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:23,877
Maybe I've been gone too long already.

484
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:26,898
Finding the clue is hard enough. How will I find the board?

485
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:41,861
Over here, everyone!

486
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,942
Ready for today's immunity test?

487
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,510
First of all,

488
00:22:57,635 --> 00:22:59,585
Andrea, I have to take her back.

489
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,190
One more time,

490
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,125
immunity is challenged.

491
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,305
Today,

492
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,597
you will climb a high wall.

493
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:10,765
Then you will collaborate

494
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,969
to advance a solid wood cube towards a post.

495
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:17,156
You will then release a set of keys.

496
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,906
With them, you will open a chest of sandbags.

497
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:24,120
You will carry them on a beam.

498
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:27,782
Upon arrival you will use a giant slingshot

499
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,452
to take down five targets.

500
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:34,823
The first two tribes to finish

501
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:37,192
gain immunity. The losers, on the board,

502
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:39,761
someone will be the fifth person

503
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,096
eliminated from the game.

504
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:42,630
Tavua, you are one more.

505
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,226
The same person cannot abstain twice in a row.

506
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:47,036
It was Troyzan, to the reward.

507
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:48,974
Cirie. Cirie will not participate.

508
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,299
The others, a minute of organization and we begin.

509
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:58,148
I think... Beam.

510
00:23:58,273 --> 00:24:00,749
No, do you think so? You, rather. No.

511
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,150
You are strong?

512
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,425
I think I should.

513
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,245
And me, that I should do it.

514
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,714
Alright, you guys decide.

515
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,658
No matter. Good.

516
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,326
Debbie, let's all keep a good attitude.

517
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,313
I have a bad attitude, because I'm tired of defending myself.

518
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:17,999
I did gymnastics for ten years, damn it!

519
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,008
This beam took me two minutes. Nobody saw?

520
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:22,274
She, ten minutes!

521
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:23,900
Without disrespecting you.

522
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:25,398
I will not do it.

523
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:27,156
Here, I have decided.

524
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:33,425
Alright, here we go. For immunity. Survivors, ready?

525
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,341
Go!

526
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:37,711
You have to go over it.

527
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,514
Things go fast with the Mana.

528
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:42,949
Yeah! First down!

529
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,794
Everyone passed.

530
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,064
On the other side, Debbie. Mana quickly moves the cube.

531
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:50,599
Here is Troyzan,

532
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,167
Sarah et Zeke.

533
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:55,337
Varner is last among the Nuku.

534
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:56,663
It's Aubry, JT

535
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,073
and Sandra.

536
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:00,000
Once again!

537
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,744
The Mana come first.

538
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:03,937
Once again!

539
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,349
A helping hand, JT?

540
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:08,951
Grimpe, JT!

541
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:11,253
Sierra is up for Mana.

542
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:13,461
Sarah pops up for Tavua.

543
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:15,657
It's JT for Nuku.

544
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:19,327
These keys must be freed by spinning them.

545
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:21,852
Did you see Brad? I was the first on the other side.

546
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:24,090
I love you. I don't know why you're mad at me.

547
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,367
Go on!

548
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,903
Sierra has them. Go ahead, Hali and Tai!

549
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,128
Sierra was quick.

550
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:32,336
Tai attacks the padlock.

551
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:33,704
JT has his.

552
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:35,443
Sarah has hers.

553
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:37,646
Michaela attacks the padlock.

554
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:39,739
Ozzy attacks the padlock for Tavua

555
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,536
and Tai for Mana.

556
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:45,045
And now how fast can you try the five keys

557
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,544
and find the right one?

558
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:47,819
Don't force.

559
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:49,968
Michaela a ses sacs.

560
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:51,785
Go for it! You have to transport

561
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:56,064
100 sandbags crossing the beam.

562
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:57,854
Michaela, take more than three!

563
00:25:57,979 --> 00:25:59,959
If you drop the bags or fall,

564
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:02,028
like Michaela, you have to start over.

565
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:04,105
Varner rushes forward.

566
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,473
It will be Hali

567
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:07,200
and Tai on the beam for Mana.

568
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:08,910
Andrea et Ozzy

569
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,036
for Tavua.

570
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:12,251
Varner loses a bag. He has to start over.

571
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:14,774
Breathe!

572
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,614
Hali passed for Mana, it's good!

573
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:19,068
Tai has to start over.

574
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:21,590
This is Andrea for Tavua. Its good.

575
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:24,095
Michaela struggles to hold on.

576
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,285
Ozzy passed.

577
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,654
Michaela succeeds!

578
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:30,857
Tai falls again.

579
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:33,808
Luckily we didn't send the gymnast, really!

580
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:37,033
Seriously, I'm really tired of having to defend myself.

581
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,458
Here is Andrea again.

582
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,584
Its good.

583
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,912
Hali loses a bag. She has to start over.

584
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,313
Here comes Ozzy again,

585
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,900
with two full handles.

586
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:49,851
When you have them all, you can start shooting.

587
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:52,554
Andrea has the latest for Tavua.

588
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,602
The Tavua are impressive on the beam.

589
00:26:57,217 --> 00:26:59,907
They have all their bags and a huge lead.

590
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:02,022
On and goes, on and goes! Allez-y, Tavua!

591
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:09,193
Tavua can now fire at targets.

592
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:11,322
Ozzy tire pour Tavua.

593
00:27:12,668 --> 00:27:13,832
And just misses.

594
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:16,136
Here is Hali, with other bags for Mana.

595
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:19,881
Michaela and Varner, still on the bags for Nuku.

596
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,683
Ozzy shoots again.

597
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:23,885
Just too low!

598
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,162
It's the last!

599
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:27,722
Tai has the last bags for Mana. Its good!

600
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,191
Come, you people!

601
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,351
Go on! The Nukus all have theirs!

602
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:33,476
Go ahead and start shooting!

603
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,065
Someone else!

604
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,890
Sarah steps forward for Tavua.

605
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:40,936
Here is Sierra for Mana.

606
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:43,697
That's it!

607
00:27:44,168 --> 00:27:46,533
Sierra scores the first point for Mana.

608
00:27:46,888 --> 00:27:48,588
Mana leads with one point.

609
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:50,315
Sarah tire.

610
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,680
Just too short.

611
00:27:52,074 --> 00:27:53,481
Sierra tire.

612
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:55,039
Sierra scores again!

613
00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:56,284
That makes two!

614
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,956
Sarah scores for Tavua!

615
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,514
JT shoots one down for Nuku!

616
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:07,253
Culpepper takes over

617
00:28:07,378 --> 00:28:08,379
for Mana.

618
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:12,092
Sarah se retire, Ozzy arrive.

619
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:15,823
Culpepper scores for Mana!

620
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:17,672
That's three for Mana.

621
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:21,910
Ozzy and JT are under pressure.

622
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,313
Culpepper seeks to hit a fourth target.

623
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:26,439
He shoots away.

624
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,718
Culpepper hits the farthest target!

625
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:32,153
That's four for Mana. more than one

626
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,178
and they take away immunity.

627
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,584
Ozzy hits the second target.

628
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:40,859
Culpepper succeeds for Mana!

629
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,956
Mana wins immunity!

630
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,924
Safe from the board!

631
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:46,793
There is one place left.

632
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:49,579
Ozzy hits the third target for Tavua.

633
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:51,339
Two more for Tavua.

634
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:53,492
Nuku needs to speed up.

635
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,742
And he touches! JT hits a second target for Nuku.

636
00:28:57,867 --> 00:28:59,447
That's 32.

637
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,369
Tavua is looking to reach fourth.

638
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:02,844
Ozzy just misses.

639
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:04,519
JT marque!

640
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:05,679
Equality.

641
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:06,946
33.

642
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:08,790
The Nuku are back in the game.

643
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,917
Only two more targets for each tribe.

644
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:15,196
JT hits a fourth target.

645
00:29:15,593 --> 00:29:17,999
Ozzy hits the Tavua's fourth target.

646
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,826
New tie, 44.

647
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:22,996
There remains one target per tribe.

648
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:24,631
You have to hit the bullseye.

649
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,876
JT, for the win!

650
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:30,452
Non! Ozzy...

651
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:33,415
Ozzy scores for Tavua!

652
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:35,308
Tavua wins immunity

653
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:39,621
and sends Nuku to the council.

654
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:42,010
You are amazing.

655
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,222
Mana, congratulations! Immunity is yours.

656
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:52,978
No one will leave Mana.

657
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,904
Tavua, congratulations!

658
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:59,642
No one will leave Tavua.

659
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:02,235
Mana, Tavua, get your things, go back to camp.

660
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,937
Enjoy your free evening.

661
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,155
Nuku, we'll see you tonight at the council,

662
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,511
where someone will be the 5th person eliminated from Survivor Game Changers.

663
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:13,480
Take your things, return to camp.

664
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:16,556
The last time I played

665
00:30:16,844 --> 00:30:19,455
the ordeal that led me to the council where I left

666
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,931
ended with a slingshot.

667
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:22,689
Today, it ended the same.

668
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:24,323
But we are in Game Changers.

669
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,835
The same thing can't happen to me twice.

670
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:28,570
I hope.

671
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:45,078
Sorry, friends.

672
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:47,222
I should have... Come to think of it,

673
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:50,058
it would have worked better by alternating the shooters.

674
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:53,495
We lost the immunity test.

675
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,222
The Fijian gods aren't too fond of Nuka these days.

676
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:58,889
Nuku. I don't even know the name of this tribe!

677
00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:00,560
This is to tell you where we are.

678
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:03,772
I have a lot more to offer than Michaela.

679
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:05,273
For me,

680
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:07,442
Michaela must be the next to go.

681
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:08,568
For JT...

682
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:11,237
We came to his camp. He did his part.

683
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:13,051
He is one of us.

684
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:14,441
I thought about it.

685
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:17,085
We'd be better off without Michaela.

686
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,078
Downright.

687
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:19,994
There would be a lot less babysitting,

688
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,884
much less bitterness, much less bad energy,

689
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:25,961
much less whining and much less sugar theft.

690
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:30,130
Of sugaring. Yeah, sweet food.

691
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,533
I do not see

692
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:35,317
any reason for anyone to keep Michaela

693
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:36,972
rather than me.

694
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:39,207
You better not make me laugh at the council.

695
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:42,066
As long as I know I'm not leaving, I'll tell the truth.

696
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,846
But if I'm afraid to leave, I'll close it.

697
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:47,071
Nope! Why would you be afraid?

698
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:50,547
No, it's obvious, I have much more to offer than her.

699
00:31:50,672 --> 00:31:52,501
If I have to play my idol, I will.

700
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:54,848
But they need me to win events.

701
00:31:54,973 --> 00:31:56,722
So it's sad for sugar,

702
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:59,419
but nothing will be sweeter than seeing Michaela leave tonight

703
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:00,883
and his torch be extinguished.

704
00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:03,431
It's damp inside. So she licked it!

705
00:32:05,102 --> 00:32:06,059
I swear!

706
00:32:06,184 --> 00:32:08,057
Let's see that pot of sugar she licked.

707
00:32:08,182 --> 00:32:09,304
I mean...

708
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,638
We no longer use this jar. Finished.

709
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,013
I told you, it's crazy, shit!

710
00:32:15,344 --> 00:32:16,936
The immunity test of the day,

711
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,311
JT had to earn it for himself, except he didn't know

712
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:22,615
how badly he had to win.

713
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,694
I have to get revenge for what happened to Malcolm.

714
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,036
And I think

715
00:32:27,647 --> 00:32:30,492
that between Varner, Michaela and me, we make a good team.

716
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:34,043
Do you think our tribe could survive without JT?

717
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:35,402
Oui.

718
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:36,723
I think so.

719
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:40,335
All JT needs is Aubry or someone else

720
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,510
and that would be bad for us.

721
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,549
I'll talk to Jeff, see what we can do.

722
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:48,264
Because I trust you more than those two.

723
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:50,988
Sandra, Varner and I,

724
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:53,273
that's three, that's enough to get out

725
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:54,749
JT.

726
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:59,287
I'm ready to see him go. He pisses me off.

727
00:32:59,537 --> 00:33:02,000
I just want you to trust me, that's all.

728
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:05,794
The only thing that could go wrong for me,

729
00:33:06,044 --> 00:33:08,863
it's if Sandra or Jeff Varner decided

730
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,666
that they would rather eliminate me than JT.

731
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,847
This is how you will go to the end with Sandra,

732
00:33:13,972 --> 00:33:17,038
because all I know how to do is reach...? The 39th day!

733
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:24,137
Alright, here's the idea.

734
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:25,733
I spoke with Michaela.

735
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:29,561
As JT has a grudge against her, he will close it.

736
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:31,696
He will leave her alone.

737
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:36,349
With you, me and Michaela, we can hang out JT.

738
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:39,754
Tonight, my situation is perfect.

739
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:43,450
I can choose to vote with Sandra and Michaela

740
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:44,724
to eliminate JT,

741
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:48,094
where I can go with JT and Aubry

742
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:49,963
and eliminate Michaela.

743
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:52,532
I would like to do both at the same time, please!

744
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:54,543
What if JT has an idol?

745
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:57,031
Anyone can have an idol in this game.

746
00:33:57,156 --> 00:33:59,180
But I want to keep winning.

747
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:02,060
So it's either eliminating an attitude problem,

748
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:04,152
or eliminate a big threat.

749
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:29,711
Good. At the last tip, Sandra,

750
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:31,338
you have arrived in the majority.

751
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:32,887
6 against 5.

752
00:34:33,012 --> 00:34:35,775
Malcolm is eliminated by surprise, you are only five.

753
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,267
What happened when you got back to camp?

754
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:43,200
JT was blamed for it, thinking he could have told Culpepper everything.

755
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:45,083
The name leaked.

756
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,695
How Tai

757
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:49,766
would he have known to whom to give the idol?

758
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,939
JT, you must have felt pressure.

759
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:55,470
Because it's a bit you who started the movement.

760
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:56,712
Without a doubt.

761
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:58,440
And I felt very guilty.

762
00:34:58,565 --> 00:35:00,776
Malcolm was the last one I wanted to see go.

763
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,409
I said two words to Culpepper.

764
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,838
He said, "Are we safe?" I said, "You're safe.",

765
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:06,439
"You all are.",

766
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,283
speaking of Sierra and him.

767
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:10,185
It wasn't sabotage.

768
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,559
But I talked too much and burned myself too.

769
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:13,755
Michaela.

770
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,882
What happens to the dynamics of the tribe?

771
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:19,895
I would say that we went from a tribe

772
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,631
where we were on an equal footing

773
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:26,167
to a tribe where someone thinks they're the fucking boss.

774
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:32,065
You are necessarily talking about JT.

775
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,275
Sure.

776
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:35,435
JT.

777
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,746
Does this surprise you or are you conflicted?

778
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:39,344
It doesn't surprise me at all.

779
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:41,941
It's clear, everyone is tired of babysitting.

780
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,884
Life in the camp is tough.

781
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,588
I have never been so excited to be on the board.

782
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:50,746
Sandra. Do you know what JT is talking about, "camp life is tough"?

783
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:53,520
Their argument started over sugar.

784
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:55,697
JT puts it in his coffee.

785
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:58,045
And there were no more.

786
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,136
He thinks Michaela licked the pot

787
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,822
where was the sugar?

788
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:05,832
It's for real!

789
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,105
That is to say if he is stupid.

790
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,529
I'm not going to put my tongue in a pot of sugar.

791
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:12,881
So it's been open conflict ever since.

792
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:14,140
Exactly.

793
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:17,711
So, Sandra, what are you basing your vote on tonight?

794
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:20,522
Knowing that you will only be four.

795
00:36:20,772 --> 00:36:22,591
Because who you eliminate

796
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:23,992
is also important

797
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:25,785
than who you keep.

798
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,062
We will keep

799
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,064
the strongest player.

800
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,333
And with him, we will go forward.

801
00:36:32,383 --> 00:36:33,460
Michaela.

802
00:36:33,585 --> 00:36:35,169
This is a clear reference to JT.

803
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:36,996
No need to pretend, right?

804
00:36:37,121 --> 00:36:39,400
No, I don't know why they act like I'm stupid.

805
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,877
It's an insult to my intelligence.

806
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:43,445
I'm not surprised.

807
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,221
But I'm like, "Damn!"

808
00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:47,849
Jeff, frankly, we're sick of babysitting.

809
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:51,049
She remains lying in the shelter all day.

810
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:53,922
And she said, "You bring me seven drops of coffee and some sugar?"

811
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,048
I was joking.

812
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:56,825
And we bring him.

813
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,152
Pause. Have you ever seen me do the dishes?

814
00:36:59,277 --> 00:37:00,794
No. She did it.

815
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,130
have you ever seen me

816
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:03,590
help cook?

817
00:37:03,715 --> 00:37:04,876
She did it.

818
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:07,934
Have you ever seen me bring food on a tray?

819
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,729
She did it. So shut up.

820
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:10,954
We continue.

821
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:14,175
I haven't seen anything like it, Michaela.

822
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,835
It's as simple as that, Jeff.

823
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,547
As he said, he speaks for the whole tribe.

824
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:19,673
Warns.

825
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:21,474
Does JT speak for the whole tribe?

826
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,929
Most of the time, yes.

827
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:26,087
Aubrey. Does JT speak for you?

828
00:37:26,212 --> 00:37:28,214
Are you sick of Michaela? Yes.

829
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:30,959
I made efforts, and there, I am perplexed.

830
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,328
Sandra. Does JT speak for you?

831
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:35,130
Are you sick of Michaela?

832
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:39,034
JT doesn't speak for me when it comes to Michaela,

833
00:37:39,284 --> 00:37:41,995
but I listen to what JT says,

834
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,663
his arguments are valid

835
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:46,046
about our future in the game.

836
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:48,365
Jeff, some of us are game changers

837
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,745
and others are just there to fill in the gaps.

838
00:37:55,812 --> 00:37:58,820
Aubrey. It seems to shake you.

839
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:01,356
Is it because you are worried about the tribe

840
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:04,125
that you don't like conflict?

841
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:08,722
Yeah, I really like Michaela.

842
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:11,967
I have great respect for his way of leading his life,

843
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:14,819
the fact that she is an intelligent and independent woman.

844
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:17,005
But this advice clearly shows

845
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,242
that we have a quality of life problem here.

846
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,286
Varner. How complicated is this vote?

847
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:24,572
Is it only?

848
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:26,239
It is incredibly complicated.

849
00:38:26,364 --> 00:38:27,965
There are disputes on the camp,

850
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,552
arguments in the tests.

851
00:38:30,677 --> 00:38:32,996
And it's unpleasant, very unpleasant.

852
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:34,122
Aubry.

853
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:36,124
Since the beginning of this council,

854
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:39,027
did you hesitate on your vote?

855
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:41,930
This vote, for me, has become crystal clear.

856
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:44,157
Is that very clear to you, Sandra?

857
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,602
JT? Yes sir.

858
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,294
And Michaela, is that for you?

859
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:50,639
It doesn't really matter.

860
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:56,202
Good. It's time to vote.

861
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:57,556
JT, over to you.

862
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,846
You have a lot to learn, child.

863
00:39:10,332 --> 00:39:12,285
FYI, you don't think for me,

864
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,988
you don't speak for me. I'm not your friend.

865
00:39:15,113 --> 00:39:16,336
Hi, Machin.

866
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,764
The queen remains queen.

867
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:25,890
Bye!

868
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:41,356
I will count the votes.

869
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:49,264
If anyone has an immunity idol and wants to play it,

870
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,124
now is the time to do it.

871
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:58,240
Good. Once the votes have been read, the decision is final.

872
00:39:58,365 --> 00:40:00,862
The eliminated person will leave the board immediately.

873
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:02,235
I will read the votes.

874
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:08,083
Premier vote,

875
00:40:09,164 --> 00:40:10,165
Michaela.

876
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:16,950
JT. A JT vote,

877
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:18,894
one vote Michaela.

878
00:40:20,186 --> 00:40:22,188
Michaela. Two votes Michaela.

879
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,259
JT. Equality. Two JT votes,

880
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,869
two votes Michaela,

881
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,392
one vote remains.

882
00:40:33,004 --> 00:40:36,009
Fifth person eliminated from Survivor Game Changers...

883
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:38,104
JT.

884
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:39,506
Holy shit!

885
00:40:40,156 --> 00:40:42,183
Bring me your torch.

886
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:49,024
And tell Malcolm you got him out!

887
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:50,775
I will do it.

888
00:40:57,534 --> 00:40:59,501
JT, the tribe has spoken.

889
00:41:02,557 --> 00:41:04,207
It's time to go.

890
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:12,138
Shit!

891
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:13,655
You are good!

892
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,518
And I didn't eat the sugar. I don't know where he went.

893
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,212
Was it you, Sandra?!

894
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:22,482
Hat!

895
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:26,494
This is the level of play we expect

896
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,797
in a season titled Game Changers.

897
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:30,198
Le hic,

898
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:33,126
as we have just seen, it is only a matter of time

899
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:35,670
before we play you.

900
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:38,365
Take your torches, return to camp. Good night.

901
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:54,756
Stay with us, to see a preview of the next episode.

902
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:57,292
Next time in Survivor...

903
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,794
No one can let their guard down.

904
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:01,563
Throw away your bandanas!

905
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:04,221
Because the surprises never end.

906
00:42:04,346 --> 00:42:05,458
What a crazy game!

907
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,636
You are going to Exile Island.

908
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:10,105
A castaway is abandoned.

909
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:14,709
And a former Survivor makes a surprise return.

910
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:16,710
I was a little overconfident.

911
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:20,696
I had not taken the idol. I didn't think I needed it.

912
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:23,051
I made a very, very stupid mistake.

913
00:42:23,176 --> 00:42:26,326
I was not up to it, in this experience.

914
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:29,994
I will always love this game, but I hate that I played this way.
