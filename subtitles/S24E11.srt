1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,211
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:07,257
"SURVIVOR": SINCE THE MERGE, KIM

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,425
HAS BROUGHT THE WOMEN TOGETHER

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,052
TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE GAME,

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,429
SENDING THREE MEN IN A ROW TO
THE JURY.

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,389
TROYZAN WAS NEXT IN LINE, BUT

7
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,266
PLAYED A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL TO

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:16,933
SAVE HIMSELF.

9
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,394
I'M NOT GOING TO JOIN THAT

10
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:19,811
GROUP.

11
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:20,520
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

12
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,397
UNABLE TO FIND A SECOND IDOL, HE

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,981
DECIDED TO FAKE ONE.

14
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,942
I START ACTING LIKE I'M

15
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:26,568
ZIPPING SOMETHING UP, LETTING

16
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,611
THEM THINK I HAVE AN IDOL.

17
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,614
Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

18
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,324
CHALLENGE-- TROYZAN WINS

19
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:33,616
IMMUNITY.

20
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,827
YES!

21
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,995
Jeff: TROYZAN WON.

22
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,413
YES, YES, YES!

23
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,457
Jeff: AND WAS SAFE FROM THE

24
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:40,999
VOTE.

25
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,125
DON'T ( BLEEP ) WITH ME.

26
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,253
Jeff: TROYZAN TRIED TO FLIP

27
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,296
THE GAME IN HIS FAVOR.

28
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,257
WHAT'S TO STORT YOU AND

29
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,259
TARZAN AND CHRISTINA GETTING RID

30
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,302
OF A STRONG PERSON?

31
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,263
TROY IS ON TO SOMETHING.

32
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,264
IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO THINK

33
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:56,806
ABOUT.

34
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,266
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

35
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,851
TROYZAN CONTINUED TO TRY TO

36
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,727
CHANGE THE VOTE.

37
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,188
KIM, CHELSEA, SABRINA AND KAT.

38
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,814
THOSE FOUR CAN DO WHATEVER THEY

39
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,482
WANT.

40
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,318
I TOLD THESE GUYS YOU CAN GO

41
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,152
FROM GETTING VOTED OUT TONIGHT,

42
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,488
TARZAN, GETTING VOTED OUT

43
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,866
TONIGHT, LEIF, GETTING VOTED OUT

44
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,909
TONIGHT TO GUARANTEE YOURSELF

45
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,036
BEING AT FIVE IF THEY WOULD VOTE

46
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:18,703
KIM OUT.

47
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,163
Jeff: IN THE END, THE WOMEN

48
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,206
STUCK WITH KIM AND CONTINUED

49
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,333
THEIR DOMINANCE OVER THE MEN.

50
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,960
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT, THE

51
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,505
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY, LEIF.

52
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,216
SENDING LEIF TO THE JURY.

53
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,425
TARZAN AND TROYZAN, IT WOULD

54
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,886
APPEAR YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS--

55
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,472
WIN IMMUNITY OR FIND A WAY IN.

56
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,890
EIGHT ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE

57
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,017
VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

58
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,693
WE'RE DOWN TO EIGHT, AND LOOK

59
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,695
WHERE WE ARE NOW, TWO BOYS LEFT.

60
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,698
SO NOW WE'RE IN A HOPELESS

61
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,325
SITUATION UNLESS THE BOYS WIN

62
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,034
IMMUNITIES.

63
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,079
SO IF I WAS TRYING TO PLAY THE

64
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,957
ODDS IN MY FAVOR, THE SMARTEST

65
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,708
THING I COULD DO IS GO WITH WHAT

66
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,502
THE GIRLS WANT ME TO DO, RATHER

67
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,003
THAN RISK BEING EXPOSED AS A

68
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,215
PERSON ON TROYZAN'S SIDE.

69
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,342
YOU OKAY?

70
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,553
I THINK HE'S JUST DOING

71
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,557
EVERYTHING HE CAN, YOU KNOW?

72
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,767
TRIBAL WAS REALLY INTERESTING

73
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,518
TONIGHT.

74
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,894
TROY THREW MY NAME OUT,

75
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,020
DEFINITELY THROWS ME A CURVEBALL

76
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,522
IN THIS GAME, LIKE, I WAS NOT

77
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,857
PLANNING ON BEING A TARGET SO

78
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,566
EARLY ON.

79
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,276
I GET NERVOUS, THAT'S FOR SURE.

80
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,235
WHICH IS FINE 'CAUSE I TRUST

81
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,028
YOU GUYS.

82
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,696
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE TONIGHT

83
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,573
SEALED THE DEAL A LITTLE BIT

84
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,782
WITH THE WOMEN'S ALLIANCE.

85
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,659
I THINK THAT EVERYBODY FEELS

86
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,579
KIND OF MARRIED TO OUR ALLIANCE,

87
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,372
LOCKED IN, SO I'M JUST TRYING TO

88
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,291
STAY CALM AND KEEP EVERYBODY

89
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,334
HAPPY AND HOPEFULLY GET RID OF

90
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,587
TROY BY THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

91
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,462
RIGHT NOW, I'M ON MY OWN.

92
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,382
I MEAN, THERE'S TARZAN, BUT HE'S

93
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,383
NOT WITH ME.

94
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,426
SO I STILL FEEL LIKE I'M, YOU

95
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,386
KNOW, ONE MAN AGAINST ALL THE

96
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:58,761
WOMEN.

97
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,470
AND TARZAN.

98
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,599
THEY THINK I HAVE AN IDOL THAT I

99
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,934
HAVEN'T PLAYED, SO THAT WILL BE

100
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,602
TO MY ADVANTAGE.

101
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,477
BUT RIGHT NOW, I NEED TO WIN

102
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,272
EVERY SINGLE IMMUNITY, ONE MAN

103
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,940
VERSUS ALL THE WOMEN.

104
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,067
BRING IT ON.

105
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:36,966
ALL RIGHT.

106
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,345

00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,930
YEAH.

108
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,430
IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A

109
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:42,805
REWARD.

110
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,308
ALL RIGHT.

111
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,478

112
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,437
EARNING REWARD TODAY.

113
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,649
YOUR POWERS OF PERCEPTION WILL

00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,985
HELP YOU GET AWAY."

115
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,196
ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO CHOOSE

116
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:58,863

REWARD, AND I THINK IT'S JUST

120
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,954
TIME FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO GO ON

121
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:06,537

122
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:06,829
YOU'RE PICKING ME, RIGHT?

123
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,914
YEAH.

124
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,332
I THINK I HAVE A GREAT

125
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,875
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM, SO IF I

126
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,336
WIN I CAN PICK KIM, AND IF SHE

127
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:22,387
WINS SHE CAN PICK ME.

128
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:33,898
WINS SHE CAN PICK ME.

129
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:40,530
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

130
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,489
I HAVE CRAZIER HAIR THAN

00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,907

00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,202
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS

Jeff: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,883
THAT MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT YOU

00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,385

00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,888
EACH TIME YOU GET ONE RIGHT, YOU

STILL BE HERE IS CHRISTINA.

180
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,578
KIM GOT IT RIGHT.

CHELSEA GOT IT RIGHT.

182
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,165
TROYZAN GOT IT RIGHT.

183
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,917
CHRISTINA, THAT IS A BIG SLAP IN

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,626
THE FACE, ISN'T IT?

185
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,460
IT IS.

186
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,129
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

187
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,425
Jeff: TROYZAN IS FIRST UP.

188
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,594
KAT GETS THE FIRST HIT.

189
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,512

00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,135
I PLANTED A FEW SEEDS.

376
00:11:59,218 --> 00:11:59,969
SO THEY START TO THINK LIKE,

377
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,388
MAYBE I REALLY AM ON THE BOTTOM.

378
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,806
AND NOW I'M GOING TO REALLY TOY

379
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,933
WITH THEIR MINDS.

380
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,364
WHOOO!

381
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:20,823
OH, MY GOD!

382
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,825
OH, MY GOD.

383
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,285
IT'S LIKE A RIDE.

384
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:24,952
DUDE, THIS IS AWESOME.

385
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,289
GLAD Y'ALL ARE HERE WITH ME,

386
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,875
NO ONE ELSE I WANTED TO BRING.

387
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,168
I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A

388
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,627
HELICOPTER SO HELICOPTER RIDE

389
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,795
DEFINITELY ONE OF THE TOP 10

390
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,379
THINGS I'VE EVER DONE.

391
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,506
IT WAS VERY, VERY COOL.

392
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,842
WE SAW BEAUTIFUL WATERFALLS.

393
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,303
THIS IS SO CRAZY.

394
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,096
IT WAS LIKE A ROLLER COASTER

395
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,805
RIDE.

396
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,973
WE WERE LOVING THE WHOLE LIKE

397
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,142
SWOOP THING, SWOOP DOWN BY THE

398
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:48,517
WAVES.

399
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:54,857
OH, MY GOD!

400
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,317
AND THEN OF COURSE TO COME

401
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,985
HERE WITH TWO OF MY FRIENDS CAN

402
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,113
THE GAME, I DON'T KNOW IF IT

403
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:08,329
HATES ANY BETTER.

404
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,914
THE REWARD WAS AWESOME, BUT I

405
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,333
CAN'T DECIDE IF I'M ENJOYING IT

406
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,584
OR NOT.

407
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,377
THE HARD PART, I FEEL LIKE A LOT

408
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,463
OF PEOPLE PROBABLY WENT HOME

409
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,130
FEELING REALLY CRUDDY.

410
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,759
YOU COULDN'T TAKE EVERYONE,

411
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,552
LIKE-- THE ONE WHO GOT A BEATING

412
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,595
WAS CHRISTINA.

413
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,888
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO

414
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,723
SOME DAMAGE CONTROL WITH OUR

415
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,099
ALLIANCE WHEN WE GET BACK.

416
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,100
( LAUGHS )

417
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,729
THE FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE AND I'M

418
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,231
TRYING TO CAMP OUT BUT IT'S

419
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,690
REALLY HARD.

420
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,359
MOSTLY I'M SCARED RIGHT NOW NOU

421
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,401
WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE

422
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,110
REWARD CHALLENGE.

423
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,403
THIS LITERALLY COULD BE THE DAY

424
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,906
THE TIDE TURNS FOR ME.

425
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,074
YOU KNOW TROY IS BACK AT CAMP

426
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,243
GOING, EVERYBODY LOVES KIM."

427
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,328
IT'S A DISASTER.

428
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,960
SO, I TOOK IT REALLY PERSONAL

429
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,920
BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY, TOO, AND I

430
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,714
HATE WHEN KIM MADE THAT COMMENT,

431
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,423
"SHE'S HUNGRY."

432
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,218
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN

433
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:04,927
SHE'S HUNGRY?

434
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,971
WE'RE ALL HUNGRY.

435
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,641
AND TROY WITH HIS COMMENT.

436
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,892
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

437
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,434
YOU'RE NOT GRASPING IT.

438
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,102
THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH.

439
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,521
YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT FOOD.

440
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,606
KAT, KAT, THIS ISN'T ABOUT FOOD

441
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,023
TODAY.

442
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,108
IT'S STRATEGY.

443
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:19,984
BECAUSE OF THE REWARD AND THE

444
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,278
FACT THAT KIM WENT OFF WITH

445
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,989
CHELSEA AND ALICIA, IT GAVE ME

446
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,156
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO FIVE

447
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,157
PEOPLE I NORMALLY WOULDN'T HAVE

448
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,243
A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN AND POWWOW

449
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:29,952
WITH.

450
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:30,619
RIGHT NOW, WHY AREN'T YOU THERE

451
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,287
RIGHT NOW?

452
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,997
I DON'T KNOW, AND I'LL DEAL

453
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,081
WITH IT WHEN SHE GETS BACK.

454
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,083
AND WHEN YOU CAN PUT FEAR IN

455
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,169
THESE PEOPLE'S HEAD YOU'RE ONE

456
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,087
STEP AHEAD.

457
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,965
HEY, PEOPLE, I'LL PLAY WITH YOUR

458
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,258
MINDS ALL THE TIME.

459
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,759
KAT, YOU GOTTA GRASP, LIKE,

460
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,635
WHAT'S GOING ON.

461
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,220
YOU THINK YOU'RE IN THE KNOW,

462
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,805
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT.

463
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:50,973
AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS, YOU

464
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,182
KNOW, BECAUSE I'M SOME GUY ON

465
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,225
THE OUTS.

466
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,310
YOU NEED TO WAKE UP.

467
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,019
NO, YOU NEED TO RELAX.

468
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,272
NO, YOU NEED TO WAKE UP.

469
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,024
WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE

470
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,150
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

471
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,486
YOU'RE ALL PISSED OFF-- GET MAD.

472
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,154
YOU SHOULD GET MAD.

473
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,030
BECAUSE THOSE GIRLS ARE TAKE

474
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,031
ADVANTAGE OF YOU AND YOU'RE

475
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,991
STARTING TO REALIZE IT AND

476
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:15,205
YOU'RE GETTING PISSED OFF.

477
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,165
I'M PISSED BECAUSE KIM DIDN'T

478
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,500
TAKE ME, AND I'M PISSED BECAUSE

479
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,252
I HAVE TO LISTEN TO TROYZAN

480
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,004
ABOUT, LIKE, I'M A FOLLOWER AND

481
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,047
I DON'T MAKE ANY DECISIONS FOR

482
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,048
MYSELF AND KIM IS THE LEAD

483
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:24,632
PLAYER.

484
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,341
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

485
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,302
THE TWO PEOPLE SHE FEELS LIKE

486
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,928
ARE NOT GOING TO FOLD SHE KEPT

487
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,554
HERE.

488
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,263
I KNOW, AND I HAVE TO DEAL

489
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,015
WITH IT, AND I DON'T WANT TO.

490
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,516
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

491
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,061
TROY WAS MAKING ME SO ANGRY.

492
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,229
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HIM SAYING

493
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:39,938
THAT.

494
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,231
IT'S LIKE HE SAYS THEY'RE THE

495
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,191
FINAL THREE.

496
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,028
LIKE, LIKE I-- NOT TRUE.

497
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,197
DON'T LET HIM GET IN YOUR

498
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,741
HEAD.

499
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,868
MY FEAR IS I DON'T WANT TO GO

500
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,370
DOWN AS A WEAK PLAYER, AND I'M

501
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,829
GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO

502
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,706
MAKE SURE THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

503
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,251
AND IF THAT HAPPENS AND IT MEANS

504
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,128
ME HAVING TO VOTE KIM OUT, FINE.

505
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,214
I'M TRYING TO EXTRACT AS MUCH

506
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,091
AS I CAN OUT OF CHRISTINA.

507
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:07,675
ALL RIGHT.

508
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,053
KAT NEEDS TO BE SOOTHED.

509
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,931
SHE'S A HOT MESS RIGHT NOW.

510
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,724
BUT RIGHT NOW, TROY IS VERY

511
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,392
SAVVY.

512
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,601
IF ANYONE CAN GO THROUGH THIS

513
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,269
DAILY GAMEALL THE WAY AND WIN

514
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,270
EVERY LAST SINGLE CHALLENGE,

515
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,605
IT'S HIM, HANDS DOWN.

516
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,275
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR MASTER PLAN,

517
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:25,943
TROY?

518
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,237
KIM CAN WIN JUST AS MUCH AS

519
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,570
ME.

520
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,071
OKAY.

521
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,115
EVERYONE LIKES HER.

522
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,908
CHELSEA IS RIGHT NEXT TO HER.

523
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,243
RIGHT NOW, I'M THE SITTING DUCK,

524
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,121
BUT IF YOU GUYS WANT ME TO GIVE

525
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,081
YOU A VOTE, I'LL GIVE YOU A

526
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:39,665
VOTE.

527
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,750
WE JUST NEED ONE GIRL TO

528
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,334
TURN.

529
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,210
THE TRUTH IS, SABRINA, I

530
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,130
MEAN, IT'S EITHER ME, YOU-- I

531
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,756
MEAN, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IS

532
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,299
GOING ON, SO WE HAVE TO THINK OF

533
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:49,925
ANOTHER OPTION.

534
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,594
OH, YEAH.

535
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,763
OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT ON TROY'S

536
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,432
SIDE, BUT THE MAIN REASON I PUT

537
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,808
IT OUT THERE, I WANTED TO SEE

538
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,601
WHO WAS EASILY SWAYED.

539
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,645
CHRISTINA WITHIN SECONDS OF ME

540
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,063
EVEN PROPOSING IT "I THINK

541
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,106
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA."

542
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,607
SHE SWAYS LIKE THE WIND.

543
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:11,155
I DON'T TRUST HER AT ALL.

544
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,323
HEY, WOW.

545
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,324
THAT WAS QUICK.

546
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:14,783
YES, IT WAS.

547
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,160
WANT TO SIT HERE?

548
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,786
OH.

549
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,912
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT

550
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:24,918
RIGHT NOW.

551
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,004
WHEN KIM CAME BACK, THERE'S A

552
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,213
LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE GOING

553
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,591
THROUGH MY MIND THAT I DIDN'T

554
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,468
KNOW IF THOSE REMEMBER SEEDS

555
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,180
THAT TROY PUT THERE, OR IF THOSE

556
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,182
WERE JUST RIDICULOUS IDEAS THAT

557
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,726
WERE MAKING ME FEEL DIFFERENTLY

558
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,351
ABOUT KIM.

559
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,145
KAT, YOU WANT SALAD?

560
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:43,812
NO.

561
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,148
I WAS JUST-- I WAS DEVASTATED.

562
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,192
AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO

563
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,360
SAY TO HER.

564
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,362

566
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:58,786
DO NOT BE MAD.

567
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,703
I'M FURIOUS.

568
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,996
I KNOW.

569
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,997
I'M FURIOUS.

570
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,040
LIKE, THAT--

571
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:03,665
DO YOU WANT ME TO TALK FIRST

572
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,666
OR DO YOU WANT TO TALK?

573
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,709
GO AHEAD.

574
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,418
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY.

575
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,837
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO TELL

576
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,338
YOU.

577
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,714
KAT, I ADORE YOU.

578
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,382
YOU'RE ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITE

579
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,050
PEOPLE HERE.

580
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,968
WE'RE PLAYING A GAME FOR $1

581
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:15,677
MILLION.

582
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,470
I WAS PLANNING TO TAKE YOU THIS

583
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,179
MORNING.

584
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,680
IT WASN'T ABOUT THE REWARD IT

585
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,348
WAS JUST ABOUT BEING PICKED

586
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,307
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HERE THINKS OF

587
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,728
ME AS A FOLLOWER PLAYER LIKE

588
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,687
CHRISTINA BECAUSE OF THAT PICK

589
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,355
TODAY.

590
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,439
WELL, IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME

591
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,148
TODAY, EITHER.

592
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,233
THIS IS MY WORST DAY OUT HERE

593
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,693
AND IT SHOULDN'T BE, AND I'M NOT

594
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,695
THROWING MYSELF A PITY PARTY.

595
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,863
I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS

596
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,156
LITERALLY THE WORST THING THAT

597
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,865
HAPPENED TO ME SINCE THE GAME

598
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,700
STARTED THAT I WON THE FREAKING

599
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,284
CHALLENGE TODAY.

600
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,494
I WISH I DIDN'T WIN IT.

601
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,996
WHY WOULD YOU WISH YOU DIDN'T

602
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,872
WIN THE CHALLENGE?

603
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,750
IT'S NOT A FUN POSITION TO BE

604
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,459
IT IN.

605
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,710
ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO RIGHT

606
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,087
NOW IS HAVE A BIGGER PICTURE

607
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:50,379
PERSPECTIVE.

608
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,215
LIKE I--

609
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,551
YOU KNOW, I THINK MY CHOICE

610
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,302
TO NOT CHOOSE KAT TODAY WAS THE

611
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,929
FIRST DECISION I HAVE MADE THAT

612
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,097
WAS NOT STRATEGIC, AND I THINK

613
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,224
I'M PAYING FOR IT NOW.

614
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:27,249
OH, MY GOD.

615
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,417
OH, MY GOD!

616
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,546
OH, MY GOD!

617
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,381
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

618
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,717
DO WE KILL IT?

619
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,092
NO.

620
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,052
OH, SHOOT!

621
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,470
WE HAVE TO SHOOT THAT THING.

622
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,431
ARE YOU KIDDING?

623
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,224
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED A ROPE.

624
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,475
WE'RE ALL AROUND THE

625
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,310

00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,569
WALK RIGHT ACROSS THE PATH.

629
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,445
I'M LIKE IS THIS AN ILLUSION?

630
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,156
AM I SEEING WHAT I'M REALLY

631
00:19:59,239 --> 00:19:59,615

632
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,449

WE'RE GETTING READY TO COOK

637
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:14,755

00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,590
OKAY, WE'RE SITTING DOWN

00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,466
ENJOYING RICE, AND WE SEE A

640
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,303
FREAKING BIG-ASS PIG COME BACK.

641
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,763
LIKE BACON AND HAM.

642
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,473
YOU ALL WANT SOME PIG?

643
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,810

644
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,312

00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:30,771
TROY.

646
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,355
KILL THE PIG.

647
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,315
I JOIN IN FOR FUN'S SAKE,

648
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,858
JUST TO GIVE MYSELF A LAUGH.

649
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,443
BUT THEN I START THINKING HOW

650
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,861
FOOLISH DOES THIS LOOK.

651
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,154
LIKE, THESE GIRLS ARE ALL

652
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,322
RUNNING AROUND, CHASING A PIG,

653
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,784
AND NOT KNOWING WHAT THE HELL

654
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,118
THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH IT ONCE

655
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:45,702
THEY CATCH IT.

656
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,370
TROY, GET IT FROM BEHIND.

657
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,454
OH!

658
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,457
OH, MY GOD.

659
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,796

00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,172
NO!

661
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:10,143
NO!

662
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,478
THEY THINK, LIKE, WE'RE GOING

663
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,605
TO KILL IT IN FIVE MINUTE AND

664
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,358
CUT A LEG OFF AND HAVE HAM

665
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,818
SANDWICHES ALL AROUND.

I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH

669
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,084
CATCHING PIGS, BUT THE PIG

670
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,419

672
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,421

THE PIG IS CUTE.

676
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,261
I'M SORRY, I'M NOT KILLING THAT

677
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:44,970
PIG.

678
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,430
WE COULD DEFINITELY KEEP IT AS A

679
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:46,888

00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,742
WHERE YOU THINK IT'S OVER-OVER.

900
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,368
YOU'RE STILL STANDING.

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,873
YOU KNOW WHAT THE ODDS ARE.

904
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,166

( LAUGHS )

907
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,879

909
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:18,965

00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,178
NOT IN "SURVIVOR."

913
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:23,887
THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING, IF

WRITTEN DOWN.

919
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:33,521
I THINK IT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO

920
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,981
HER THE WHOLE GAME.

921
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,524
SHE KNOWS EVERYBODY IS NOT CRAZY

922
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,192
ABOUT HER.

923
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:37,901
ANYBODY ELSE IS GOING TO FLIP.

924
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,902
RIGHT, RIGHT.

925
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,529

TROY, WE DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS

928
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,242
AN IDOL SO WE HAVE TO SPLIT THE

929
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,994
VOTE BUT I'M GETTING TIRED

930
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,370
EVERYONE IS TELLING ME WHAT TO

931
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,038
DO.

932
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,039
NO ONE THINKS I'M ONE RUNNING

933
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:51,664
THE SHOW.

934
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,500
EVERYONE THINKS KIM IS.

935
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,834
LIKE, I CAN'T MAKE A DECISION

936
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,376
FOR MYSELF?

937
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,920
LIKE, WHAT IS THIS?

938
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:57,879
IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME.

939
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:03,176
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

940
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,386
SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THE

941
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,137
VOTES?

942
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:06,930
AND IF YOU JUST WANT TO CONFIRM

943
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,015
IT WITH THEM WE'RE FINE.

944
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:09,682
YOU'RE SPLITTING.

945
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,061
YEAH, ME AND TARZAN KNOW TO

946
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,355
VOTE FOR YOU, BUT IT'S NOT YOU,

947
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,064
OKAY?

948
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,524
WE'RE JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE.

949
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,108
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.

950
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,611
YOU'RE NOT SURE IF HE HAS THE

951
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:21,903
IDOL.

952
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,570
RIGHT.

953
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,781
AND THEN THE REST OF US WILL

954
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,740
VOTE FOR TROY.

955
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,033
OKAY.

956
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,744
THE PLAN TONIGHT IS TO SPLIT

957
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:30,286
THE VOTE AND I'M GOING TO STICK

958
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,039
WITH KIM'S PLAN SO I LET

959
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,290
CHRISTINA KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

960
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,124
VOTE YOU AND YOU'RE NOT GOING

961
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:35,833
HOME.

962
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,294
I SHOULD HAVE JUST THROWN OUT

963
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:38,962
ANOTHER NAME.

964
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,547
I DON'T WANT HER TO FEEL BAD

965
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,590
BECAUSE PEOPLE DO NOT FORGET HOW

966
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,133
YOU MAKE THEM FEEL.

967
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,053
THE REASON WE DID IT, YOU'RE NOT

968
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:47,929
SURPRISED SEEING YOUR NAME ONCE,

969
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:48,638
TWICE, WHATEVER.

970
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,391
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT AT

971
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,100
ALL.

972
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,769
I DON'T THINK SHE PROCESSED IT

973
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:55,979
ENOUGH, I MAY BE GOING HOME IF

974
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,815
HE HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL BUT SHE

975
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,942
WAS FINE WITH IT.

976
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:12,620
SHE'S GOING TO?

977
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,164
YEAH, SHE SAID NOT TO, LIKE,

978
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:15,748
FREAK OUT.

979
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,458
ARE YOU OK WITH THAT?

980
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,419
IF I GOT A COUPLE OF VOTES,

981
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,004
ALL HELL WOULD BREAK LOOSE.

982
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,173
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, CHRISTINA'S

983
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,174
I.Q. IS PROBABLY A 0.

984
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,968
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT EVEN

985
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,552
EXISTS.

986
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,804
I MEAN, I'M A SPECIAL ED

987
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,472
TEACHER, SO I HANDLE CHRISTINA

988
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,349
AS ONE OF MY STUDENTS, AND SHE'S

989
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,434
GOING TO DO WHATEVER WE TELL HER

990
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,018
TO DO.

991
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,146
AND IF TROY PULLS OUT AN

992
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,106
IMMUNITY IDOL, CHRISTINA'S GOING

993
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,107
TO GO, AND SHE HAS TO GO, THEN

994
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,192
SHE HAS TO GO.

995
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,028
IT AIN'T MY NAME, SO I DON'T

996
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:45,570
CARE.

997
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,030
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

998
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,032
I'M FEELING FINE.

999
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:52,160
YEAH.

1000
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,872
YEAH, I HOPE THAT YOU FEEL

1001
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,456
FINE.

1002
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,206
YOU ALWAYS FEEL LIKE YOU

1003
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,082
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

1004
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,834
THE GIRLS AND STUFF.

1005
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:01,002
I'M ALWAYS, LIKE, SCARED.

1006
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,670
THAT'S WHY I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO

1007
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,379
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S ANYTHING ON

1008
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,007
WITH THEM AND FIGURE OUT THEIR

1009
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:06,674
PLACEMENT AND STUFF.

1010
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,509
YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE SAYING

1011
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,177
THERE'S STRATEGY BEHIND WHY

1012
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,261
THOSE GIRLS WENT THE THREE OF

1013
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,220
THEM, AND EVERYTHING?

1014
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:15,892
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW,

1015
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:16,684
YOU HAVE TWO.

1016
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,394
YOU HAVE KIM, AND THEN YOU HAVE

1017
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,103
CHELSEA.

1018
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,855
I DON'T TRUST THE GIRLS 100%.

1019
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,190
SO THAT'S WHY I ENTERTAIN THE

1020
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,859
IDEA OF TROYZAN'S PROPOSAL

1021
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:28,196
BECAUSE IT MAKES-- IT MAKES

1022
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,405
SENSE.

1023
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,198
KIM WON, YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR HER.

1024
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,408
I NEVER PUT YOUR NAME DOWN, JUST

1025
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,451
TO LET YOU OPINION

1026
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,203
( LAUGHS )

1027
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,413
IF YOU VOTE CHELSEA, I'LL VOTE

1028
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:37,705
CHELSEA.

1029
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,414
OKAY.

1030
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,208
CHRISTINA SAID SHE WOULD VOTE

1031
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,084
FOR CHELSEA, BUT I DON'T THINK

1032
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,419
ANYBODY ELSE WOULD VOTE FOR

1033
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,170
CHELSEA.

1034
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,046
SO NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRY

1035
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,714
TO SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT WHO

1036
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,423
THEY'RE SPLITTING THIS VOTE

1037
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,257
WITH, AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

1038
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,093
VOTE FOR THAT PERSON.

1039
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,720
I MEAN, THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING

1040
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,930
TO SPLIT VOTE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

1041
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,890
KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING.

1042
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,892
BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS

1043
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,560
HOW THEY REALLY CAN SPLIT THIS

1044
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,228
VOTE.

1045
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,229
THEY CAN PROBABLY SPLIT IT,

1046
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,730
AND THEN THERE'S THE

1047
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,898
POSSIBILITY-- BECAUSE I HEARD MY

1048
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:04,941
NAME'S GOING TO BE WRITTEN DOWN

1049
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,776
AND EVERYTHING.

1050
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,402
AND--

1051
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,695
WHEN CHRISTINA SAID WHO

1052
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,447
THEY'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTE

1053
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,701
WITH-- I'M LIKE, GREAT.

1054
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,368
THAT'S EASY.

1055
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,285
I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE

1056
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,704
VOTE, HOW IT COULD GO.

1057
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,414
I NEED THREE PEOPLE TO JUST VOTE

1058
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,123
FOR CHRISTINA AND THEN, BOOM, I

1059
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,124
CAN BE THE FOURTH.

1060
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,919
AND IT CAN BE A MIRACLE.

1061
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:25,253
SERIOUSLY.

1062
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:25,962
BOOM.

1063
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,171
ALL OF A SUDDEN, CHRISTINA'S,

1064
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,549
LIKE, GONE, AND THAT WOULD BE

1065
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,133
BEAUTIFUL.

1066
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,551
IF WE ALL DO WHAT WE SAID

1067
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,262
WE'LL DO, TROY WILL GO HOME

1068
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:34,929
TONIGHT.

1069
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,055
NOBODY CHANGE THEIR MINDS.

1070
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,765
THE PLAN IS TONIGHT TO GIVE

1071
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,767
TROY FIVE VOTES AND CHRISTINA

1072
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,393
TWO.

1073
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,227
I THINK SPLITTING VOTES IS

1074
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:41,936
ALWAYS HARD BECAUSE YOU DON'T

1075
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,147
KNOW WHO IS WITH YOU AND WHO IS

1076
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,481
NOT SO YOU HAVE FIVE PEOPLE

1077
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,190
VOTING FOR TROY.

1078
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,151
IF TWO FLIP, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

1079
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,986
TROY'S BACK IN THE GAME TONIGHT.

1080
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:50,653
WELL, BUDDY?

1081
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,113
WELL, I'M STILL UP FOR GRABS

1082
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:52,780
TODAY.

1083
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,824
YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING

1084
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,450
HOME.

1085
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,493
I WON'T BELIEVE TROYZAN IS

1086
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,953
GOING HOME UNTIL THE MOMENT HE

1087
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,997
STANDS IN FRONT JEFF AND JEFF

1088
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,831
SNUFFS HIS TORCH.

1089
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,291
YOU CAN CONSIDER CHANGING

1090
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,752
YOUR MIND ABOUT WHO YOU'RE

1091
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,461
VOTING FOR.

1092
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,336
DON'T GO WITH KIM AND CHELSEA.

1093
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,130
HE'S, LIKE, FULL OF CRAZINESS

1094
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,798
AND SURPRISES.

1095
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,175
I MEAN, HE'S JUST PLAYING SO

1096
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:12,800
HARD.

1097
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,761
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S ABOUT TO

1098
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,846
HAPPEN?

1099
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,486
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1100
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:36,074
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1101
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,826
JONAS, MICHAEL, JAY, AND LEIF,

1102
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,827
VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL

1103
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:46,667
COUNCIL.

1104
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,419
SO, STARTED AS MEN VERSUS WOMEN.

1105
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,506
IT CERTAINLY APPEARED YET AGAIN

1106
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,508
TODAY STILL BE MEN VERSUS WOMEN.

1107
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,176
IS THAT WHERE WE'RE AT, TROYZAN?

1108
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,094
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE BECAUSE YOU

1109
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,428
DO NOT HAVE THE NECKLACE?

1110
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,513
OH, YEAH.

1111
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,473
IT'S STILL ALL THE WOMEN, PLUS

1112
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,057
TARZAN.

1113
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,144
AND I'M NOT WEARING THE

1114
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,354
NECKLACE, SO WE'LL SEE IF THE

1115
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,147
"SURVIVOR" GOD ARE OUT THERE.

1116
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,148
YOU NEVER KNOW.

1117
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,983
Jeff: SABRINA, IF IT IS MEN

1118
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:11,901
VERSUS WOMEN.

1119
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:12,944
THERE ARE SIX OF YOU.

1120
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:13,444
HAS THERE BEEN MUCH TALK ABOUT

1121
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,363
WHO IS NUMBER SIX?

1122
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,406
WHO IS NUMBER FIVE?

1123
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,324
I WOULDN'T SAY AMONGST ALL

1124
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,202
SIX OF US.

1125
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:25,414
IT'S BEEN DROPPED SINCE AT A

1126
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,333
TWO, DAY 10, DAY 19.

1127
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,876
Jeff: SO CHRISTINA,YOU WHAT

1128
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,419
THAT MEANS, RIGHT?

1129
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,421
WHAT SHE SAID IS I DON'T THINK

1130
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,339
ALL SIX OF US HAVE TALKED ABOUT

1131
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:33,965
IT.

1132
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,342
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THERE ARE

1133
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,051
CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE,

1134
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,178
AND NO ONE IS REALLY CLEAR ABOUT

1135
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,055
WHO IS THE TOP FIVE, TOP FOUR,

1136
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:42,557
TOP THREE.

1137
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,225
Jeff: CHELSEA, AGREE WITH

1138
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:44,809
THAT?

1139
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,060
NO, I FEEL LIKE THIS GAME

1140
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,104
STARTED SO FAST, THAT PEOPLE

1141
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,398
WERE THINKING OUT TOP THREE ON

1142
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,733
DAY ONE.

1143
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,279
BUT SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE WHO
THINK ARE GOING TO BE YOUR TOP
THREE GET VOTED OUT.

1144
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,573
PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND

1145
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:58,990
FLIP-FLOP.

1146
00:35:59,073 --> 00:35:59,615
THINGS CHANGE.

1147
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,992
Jeff: TROYZAN, THAT SOUNDS

1148
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,285
LIKE THE KIND OF ANSWER YOU WANT

1149
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,911
TO HEAR.

1150
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,413
THAT TELLS ME SHE'S NOT

1151
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,875
COMPLETELY 100% WITH HER

1152
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,417
ALLIANCE.

1153
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:09,750
Jeff: CHRISTINA, WHY ARE

1154
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,710
YOU HERE?

1155
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,460
WHY AM I HERE?

1156
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,880
BECAUSE I'M ONE LUCKY GIRL.

1157
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:14,463
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

1158
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,466
Jeff: ALICIA, WHY ARE YOU

1159
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,969
LAUGHING?

1160
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,221
I FIND IT FUNNY THAT WAS HER

1161
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,472
ANSWER BECAUSE WHEN WE HAD THE

1162
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,224
REWARD CHALLENGE THE GENERAL

1163
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,226
CONSENSUS WAS CHRISTINA DOESN'T

1164
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:27,810
DESERVE TO BE HERE.

1165
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,604
Jeff: CHRISTINA, WHAT DID

1166
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,897
THAT FEEL LIKE?

1167
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,399
WELL, THAT REALLY HURT MY

1168
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,066
FEELINGS.

1169
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,734
I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

1170
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,110
BEGIN IS NO ONE REALLY GOT A

1171
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,112
CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW ME.

1172
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:38,946
Jeff: BUT THIS CHALLENGE

1173
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,616
WAS JUST TWO DAYS AGO.

1174
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,743
RIGHT, I GET THAT.

1175
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,452
Jeff: AND THAT'S IMPORTANT,

1176
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,621
CHRISTINA, IS A JURY WILL DECIDE

1177
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,330
WHO WINS, AND THE JURY HERE OF

1178
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,582
THE PEOPLE STILL IN THE GAME,

1179
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,791
THINK YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE

1180
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,459
HERE.

1181
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,376
I THINK I DESERVE TO BE HERE

1182
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,419
JUST AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

1183
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,003
I--

1184
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,796
BUT I THINK THE GENERAL

1185
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,131
CONSENSUS WAS YOU DIDN'T HAVE

1186
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,090
ANY STRATEGY THROUGHOUT THE

1187
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:58,633
GAME.

1188
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,467
I HAVE BEEN STRATEGIZING

1189
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,510
THROUGHOUT THE GAME.

1190
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,970
I JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT IT

1191
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,847
BECAUSE THE WHOLE GAME IS ABOUT

1192
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,601
DECEPTION AND OUTWIT, OUTPLAY,

1193
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,226
OUTLAST.

1194
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,853
Jeff: TROYZAN, ONCE AGAIN,

1195
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:11,520
MORE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

1196
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,564
NOW CHRISTINA HAS TO DEFEND

1197
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,815
HERSELF TO ALICIA, ONE OF THE

1198
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,983
SIX WOMEN IN HER ALLIANCE.

1199
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,026
OH, YEAH.

1200
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,527
EVERYONE KNOWS CHRISTINA'S ON

1201
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,153
THE BOTTOM.

1202
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,363
THEY'LL NEVER ADMIT THAT.

1203
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,990
BUT IT'S JUST FUNNY TO LISTEN TO

1204
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,283
THESE LADIES THAT DON'T REALLY

1205
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,327
SAY EVERYTHING.

1206
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,537
Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

1207
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,580
REWARD CHALLENGE.

1208
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,123
TROYZAN, YOU WERE PRETTY VOCAL

1209
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:31,999
AT WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS GOING

1210
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:32,333
ON.

1211
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,209
OF COURSE.

1212
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,502
THERE ARE SIX GIRLS SAYING, I

1213
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,504
BELIEVE EVERYBODY, AND WE'RE ALL

1214
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,547
BELIEVING EVERYTHING, AND WE'RE

1215
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,675
ALL JUST HAPPEN CAMPERS HERE'S."

1216
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,510
IF YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY TO BELIEVE

1217
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,847
EVERYBODY, GUESS WHAT, I HAVE
OCEAN-FRONT PROPERTY IN KANSAS
I'LL SELL YOU.

1218
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,099
Jeff: I'M FROM KANSAS.

1219
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,684
THERE IS NO OCEAN-FRONT

1220
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:49,976
PROPERTY.

1221
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,520
EXACTLY.

1222
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,146
Jeff: KIM, WERE YOU

1223
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,356
ENCOURAGED AT ALL HAVING TO PICK

1224
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,191
PEOPLE TO GO WITH YOU, WHICH

1225
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,359
MEANT OTHER PEOPLE WERE LEFT

1226
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:58,651
OUT?

1227
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,193
YEAH.

1228
00:37:59,277 --> 00:37:59,902
I MEAN, ABSOLUTELY.

1229
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,362
IT WAS KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF A

1230
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,113
NIGHTMARE.

1231
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,197
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE BACK

1232
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,365
AT CAMP.

1233
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,742
AND, YOU KNOW, TROY'S A

1234
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,451
BRILLIANT GUY.

1235
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,494
HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY.

1236
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,162
HE'S REALLY SMART.

1237
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,623
AND HE'S GOOD AT GETTING INTO

1238
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,165
PEOPLE'S HEADS.

1239
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,542
Jeff: KAT, YOU WERE

1240
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,876
HEARTBROKEN THAT YOU WEREN'T

1241
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,127
CHOSEN.

1242
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:16,836
WHY?

1243
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,503
I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE

1244
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,672
COMMENT TROY MADE ABOUT KIM

1245
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,549
ALICIA AND CHELSEA.
THAT'S THE TOP THREE RIGHT
THERE.

1246
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,384
AND I THOUGHT AM I A WEAK
PLAYER?

1247
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,927
AM A FOLLOWER?

1248
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:29,432
AM I SO FAR UP KELSEY AND KIM'S
ASS THAT I CAN'T MAKE A DECISION
FOR MYSELF.

1249
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:38,024
I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN AS A
WEAK PLAYER OR A FOLLOWER.
SO HE GOT TO ME.

1250
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,275
Jeff: TROYZAN AS WE GET

1251
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,568
READY TO VOTE, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR

1252
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,779
IT'S YOU OR SOMEBODY ELSE.

1253
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,406
YOUR JOB TODAY WAS TO MAKE IT

1254
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,782
SOMEBODY ELSE.

1255
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,701
HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW?

1256
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:53,080
I FEEL PRETTY GOOD.

1257
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,081
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, CANNOT

1258
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:54,749
VOTE FOR KIM.

1259
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,125
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1260
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,585
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1261
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,463
CHELSEA, YOU'RE UP.

1262
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,723
I AM HOPING THAT YOU

1263
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,808
GET A LOT OF VOTES

1264
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,654
PLEASE, GO HOME

1265
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,128
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:49,345
VOTES

1267
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,471
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1268
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,180
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1269
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,766
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE TIME TO DO

1270
00:39:53,849 --> 00:40:02,024
SO.

1271
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,192
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1272
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,276
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1273
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,985
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1274
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,154
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1275
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:07,696
IMMEDIATELY.

1276
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,490
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1277
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:16,997
FIRST VOTE, CHELSEA.

00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,792

TROY.

00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:28,676
ONE VOTE CHELSEA.

1283
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:33,013
CHRISTINA.

1284
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,181
CHRISTINA.

1285
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:38,811
THAT'S TWO VOTES CHRISTINA.

1286
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,186
CHRISTINA.

1287
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,020
WE'RE TIED.

1288
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,355
THREE VOTES CHRISTINA, THREE

1289
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,440
VOTES TROY, ONE VOTE CHELSEA.

1290

11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

TROY.

1294
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:57,705
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1295
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,375
DO IT.

1296
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,544
DO IT.

1297
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,629
Jeff: TROYZAN, THE TRIBE

1298
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,716
HAS SPOKEN.

1299
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,801
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1300
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,438
WELL, IT HAS BEEN THE MISSION OF

1301
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,232
THIS GROUP TO GET RID OF

1302
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:25,816
TROYZAN.

1303
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,150
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

1304
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,527
NOW WHAT?

1305
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,278

Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1313
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:49,965
SURVIVOR.

1314
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:50,883
TARZAN IS THE LAST MAN STANDING

1315
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,384
BUT CAN THE WOMEN KEEP IT

1316
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:52,927
TOGETHER?

1317
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,303
I AM SO MAD RIGHT NOW.

1318
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,304
DEFINITELY ENOUGH REASON TO VOTE

1319
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:55,971
OFF KAT.

1320
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,432
SABRINA HAS NO IDEA THAT HER

1321
00:41:58,515 --> 00:41:59,099
ASS IS ON THE LINE.

1322
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,560
THAT'S WHY A BLINDSIDE IS SO

1323
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,228
GREAT.

1324
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,771
EVERYONE IS WANTING KAT OUT

1325
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,230
NEXT.

1326
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,648
SABRINA FIRST.

1327
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,607
FROM HERE ON OUT, IT'S GOING

1328
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,734
TO BE A CAT FIGHT.

1329
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,113
THE LAST 11 YEARS I'VE BEEN

1330
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,782
THINKING I'M GOING TO GET ON

1331
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,116
"SURVIVOR" AND MY ONLY OBJECTIVE

1332
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,118
IS TO BE THE WINNER AND I'M A

1333
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,620
BIT SAD THAT I DIDN'T REACH MY

1334
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,287
GOAL.

1335
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:20,621
DEFINITELY THE ODDS WERE AGAINST

1336
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,163
ME.

1337
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,790
IT WAS SEVEN ON ONE.

1338
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:27,503
BUT I DID WHAT I COULD DO.

1339
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,587
I PLAYED EXACTLY WHO I AM.
THE FANS OUT THERE I KNOW ARE
GOING TO LOVE MY GAME AND THEY
WILL APPRECIATE IT.
