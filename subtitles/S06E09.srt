00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:03,378
JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:06,423
<i>Jacaré was worried about</i>
<i>Matthew's bizarre behavior.</i>

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,133
I promise I won't harm anyone.

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,718
I don't like
the sight of blood.

5
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,094
Why does he need
the machete so sharp?

6
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,929
<i>I think he's gonna kill us.</i>

7
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,890
PROBST:<i> So Rob pretended to form</i>
<i>an alliance with Matthew</i>

8
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,600
<i>for his own protection.</i>

9
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,561
I am taking my life
into my hands

10
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,980
<i>with the amount of lies</i>
<i>that I'm telling him.</i>

11
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,481
PROBST:
<i>But Rob's true alliance</i>

12
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>with Alex, Jenna,</i>
<i>Deena and Heidi</i>

13
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,944
<i>was targeting Dave.</i>

14
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:30,155
I've had an ax to grind
with Dave for so long.

15
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,115
<i>He's a show-off, he's arrogant.</i>

16
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,241
<i>I can't take any more.</i>

17
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,242
<i>Dave's got to go.</i>

18
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,618
<i>He's a threat.</i>

19
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,788
PROBST:<i> And when Dave won</i>
<i>a muddy reward challenge...</i>

20
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,123
Dave wins reward.

21
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,501
<i>...he chose to share it</i>
<i>with Deena to plead his case.</i>

22
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,421
I'm just trying
to salvage myself

23
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,797
to stick around
as long as possible.

24
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,798
I know.

25
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,133
I'll see what I can do.

26
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,427
PROBST:
<i>But the immunity challenge</i>

27
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>showed the tribe where</i>
<i>they stood with each other.</i>

28
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,306
Boo-yah!

29
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,808
<i>Dave and Matthew</i>
<i>were the first eliminated.</i>

30
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,435
Welcome to the morgue.

31
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,270
<i>And it was Jenna</i>
<i>who took home immunity.</i>

32
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,314
(cheering)

33
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,648
Nice job, Jenna.

34
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,444
<i>At Tribal Council, Jacaré's</i>
<i>decision was unanimous.</i>

35
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,071
The eighth person voted out and
the first member of our jury:

36
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,406
Dave.

37
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,035
The tribe has spoken.

38
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,036
<i>Eight remain.</i>

39
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,954
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

40
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,110
(whispers)

41
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,789
(quietly):
This is what I had to come

42
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,207
over here to talk to you about.

43
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,919
I am privy
to some information that

44
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,090
there are some females
with this tribe that are

45
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:57,594
somewhat unhappy
with the leadership role

46
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,053
that Deena has assumed.

47
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,555
ROB:
<i>Every morning, I give Matt</i>

48
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,600
<i>a debriefing</i>
<i>of the wild-goose chases</i>

49
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,436
I want him to work on for the
day, just to keep his mind busy,

50
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,062
<i>so he doesn't really</i>
<i>have any chance</i>

51
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,606
<i>to figure out</i>
<i>what's actually going on.</i>

52
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,483
This is very
highly confidential.

53
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,611
Deena was saying that you are
the biggest threat.

54
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,613
Right. I would assume that.

55
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,156
I mean, people thought
I was the biggest threat

56
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,282
on, like, day two.

57
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,450
Yeah, that's true.

58
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,285
ROB:<i> I've been really</i>
<i>filling Matt's head</i>

59
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,453
<i>with a lot of crazy stuff,</i>

60
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,456
and I've been telling him
about how the men are gonna

61
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,041
vote off all the women

62
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,918
<i>and that we need Butch's help.</i>

63
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,129
<i>So, Matt is off on a bunch</i>
<i>of wild-goose chases.</i>

64
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,923
Because you're the person
I trust most in this tribe.

65
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:35,924
Okay, good.

66
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,258
Butch-- I pulled Butch in

67
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,260
because I think that
he's a, he's a good guy.

68
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,930
Butch is on, seriously,
on a need-to-know basis.

69
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,806
All right, let's-let's go back
before anybody misses us.

70
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,475
You go first.
I'll go to the bathroom.

71
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,434
All right.

72
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,145
You go that way
and I'll go the other way.

73
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,450
We gotta be...
we gotta be a chain.

74
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,369
A what?

75
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,913
Chain like a chain-link.

76
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,331
MATTHEW:
<i>It's a chain,</i>

77
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,000
<i>and I'm Butch's link</i>
<i>to what's happening.</i>

78
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,045
<i>I've told him that</i>
<i>I will decide when we speak,</i>

79
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,214
I will initiate
all communication.

80
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,132
I'll decide
how much information he gets.

81
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,926
<i>I am his lifeline.</i>

82
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,179
No one hears anything about our
conversations; they don't exist.

83
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,514
We don't talk about anything.

84
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,974
No, we don't
talk about anything.

85
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,725
And I initiate
all communication.

86
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,353
You initiate all communication.

87
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,021
I guess it's like a chain.

88
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,148
You got your big chain,
big four together,

89
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,025
and then you want to be
one of those links.

90
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,403
And you want to be
that, uh, seventh link,

91
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,405
then maybe sixth,
then maybe five,

92
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,240
and then maybe...
there may be a break

93
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,033
and you can jump in there
and grab on.

94
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,035
And that's what you want
to be able to do.

95
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,578
Okay, that's it.

96
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,206
No more talk.

97
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,043
ROB:
<i>It's funny because it's like,</i>

98
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,962
I tell him what to do,
and then he feels like--

99
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,381
then he goes
and tells Butch what to do.

100
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,216
-(laughter)
-Then it's like,

101
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,719
Butch is like--
it's like he's the operative.

102
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,555
And he's like, he's like,
"I told Butch, I said,

103
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,850
Butch, you're on
a need-to-know basis."

104
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,436
(laughter)

105
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,605
<i>The fact of the matter</i>
<i>is that Matt is</i>

106
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,734
<i>who the group would like to</i>
<i>vote out next because we think</i>

107
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,569
that he's mentally unstable,

108
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,863
and we're afraid
that he may kill us.

109
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,407
So, uh, we're trying
not to let him know

110
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,825
he's gonna be voted out.

111
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,326
JENNA:
<i>We need to be very cautious</i>

112
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,287
that he does not feel threatened
or he does not

113
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,914
feel like he needs to kill us,
any of us.

114
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,583
Is Matthew a physical threat?

115
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,626
Yeah, to my safety.

116
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,379
(chuckles)

117
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,635
Treemail, treemail,
here we come.

118
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,387
-Oh, no!
-Oh, no.

119
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,224
"Practice, practice, practice,
Don't compete in haste,

120
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:54,771
Smell the aroma of victory,
Get Brazil's most famous taste."

121
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,938
Coffee?

122
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,315
You're right,
"the aroma of victory."

123
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,775
You know who's gonna win?

124
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,276
-JENNA: Alex.
-I would say Matt.

125
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,569
JENNA:
Oh, Matt. Absolutely.

126
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,904
"Smell the aroma of victory."

127
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,614
I don't know
how good an idea this is,

128
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,115
to give us a bow and arrow.

129
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,909
What you got there?

130
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,244
DEENA:
Bows and arrows.

131
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,913
Matt's gonna orgasm with this.

132
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,956
Think these are blow darts, too.

133
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,208
That's good.

134
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,628
MATTHEW:<i> Everyone took</i>
<i>one of the weapons for a spin.</i>

135
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,422
You know, everyone took
a couple shots with the arrows,

136
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,758
couple throws with the spear

137
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,176
<i>and blew a couple darts.</i>

138
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,360
Not bad.

139
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,371
ROB:<i> Coming into this game, the</i>
<i>only spears I knew about were</i>

140
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,874
Britney and broccoli
and asparagus.

141
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,960
Harder than that.

142
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,962
Do I need to, like,
totally put my mouth around it?

143
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:01,921
Yeah, I think so.

144
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,136
Very good.

145
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,139
Matt, I really-- I think
you got this one in the bag.

146
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,140
Not necessarily.

147
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,975
What do you think?

148
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,810
I think, I think
you're 100% right.

149
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,395
If I was in your situation,

150
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,105
I'd be thinking the same,
the same way.

151
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,982
ROB:
<i>Matt came to me and said,</i>

152
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,568
<i>"I'm not gonna</i>
<i>try my hardest today</i>

153
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,987
<i>because I don't want people to</i>
<i>think I'm a physical threat."</i>

154
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,240
And I said,
"Matt, I think you're finally

155
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,825
starting to understand
this game."

156
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,077
You are, you are
figuring this game out.

157
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,787
Good. I'm learning, man.

158
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,416
Ow, that one hit my hand.

159
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,042
You okay?

160
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,216
Come on down, guys.

161
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,385
Everybody good?

162
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,513
Today's reward challenge is

163
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,726
going to test your proficiency
using three weapons,

164
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,728
all indigenous to the Amazon.

165
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,063
For the first round,
all eight will participate.

166
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,024
<i>You'll shoot blow darts.</i>

167
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,859
<i>The four people with</i>
<i>the highest score will move</i>

168
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,862
<i>to the second round,</i>
<i>where you will throw spears.</i>

169
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,405
<i>The top two finishers</i>
<i>from that round</i>

170
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,781
<i>will move on</i>
<i>to the final round,</i>

171
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,743
<i>where you will</i>
<i>shoot a bow and arrow.</i>

172
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,828
Person closest to the bull's-eye
wins reward.

173
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,205
-Want to know what your
playing for? -Yeah. -Mm-hmm.

174
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,165
Well, one of the things

175
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,918
that Brazil is best known for
is its coffee.

176
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,045
So we have constructed,
for the winner

177
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:28,257
<i>of today's challenge,</i>
<i>your own</i> Survivor<i> coffee bar.</i>

178
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,926
Have a little sampling here.

179
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,052
-Oh, my...
-(chuckling)

180
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,929
So, I'll let you guys
divvy this up.

181
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,639
Little piece of croissant there.

182
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,099
Heidi, you take it and
figure out what to do with it.

183
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,392
Everyone take a little bit.

184
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,727
Worth playing for?

185
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,937
-I think so.
-Yes. -Mm-hmm.

186
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,105
Okay, we'll draw numbers to
determine the order in which

187
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,274
you shoot your blow darts
and we'll get started.

188
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,112
All right, first round:
Christy, you're up first.

189
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,114
Let's go, Christy.

190
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,619
There we go.

191
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,120
-Nice job.
-(applause)

192
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,081
Christy, first on the board
with three.

193
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,212
Top four move on.

194
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,432
-Wow!
-Ho!

195
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,809
Bull's-eye. Ten points.

196
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,477
Nice job.

197
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,478
Butch.

198
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,688
Loses the glasses.

199
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,107
Let's go, Butch.

200
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,319
Nice shot.

201
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,487
That's clearly a five.

202
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,239
(applause)

203
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,702
Rob, you look like
you're gonna be good at this.

204
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,161
(snickering)

205
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,040
Not bad. Not bad.

206
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,669
Matthew in the lead
with ten points, Butch at five,

207
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,337
Rob and Christy at three.

208
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,006
Alex.

209
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,009
Nice and slow, dude.

210
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,471
-Nice shot. Seven.
-Ooh. Good job.

211
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,181
With that, Alex moves
into second place.

212
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,683
Matthew's still in the lead
at ten points.

213
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,893
Jenna.

214
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,523
-Oh!
-Three.

215
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:08,524
That's okay.

216
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:09,692
-Good job.
-Good job, Jenna.

217
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,277
-Thank you, guys.
-Deena.

218
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,405
And five.

219
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,365
Here's our countdown:

220
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,703
Matt has ten, Alex at seven,
Butch and Deena tied at five.

221
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,414
That knocks Jenna out,
along with Christy and Rob.

222
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,290
Heidi.

223
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,335
Gonna take a five
to keep you alive.

224
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,172
-That's not a five.
-Mm.

225
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,548
-Nope.
-Zip.

226
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,216
-Good try. -That's okay.
-Good try, Heidi.

227
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,219
Matt, Alex, Butch and Deena
moving on to round two.

228
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,721
You will throw spears.

229
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,556
The two closest
to the bull's-eye

230
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,224
moves on to the next round.

231
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,018
Matthew,
you drew first this time.

232
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,525
That'll work.

233
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,610
(cheering, shouting)

234
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,112
Wow, that's gonna be
tough to beat.

235
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,113
Deena, you're up.

236
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,574
Take your first shot.
The two closest move on.

237
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,036
(Deena blows a raspberry)

238
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,245
No score for Deena.

239
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,246
That's okay.

240
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,706
-It's all right, D.
-You made it this far.

241
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,957
Butch.

242
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,960
Did okay with the blow darts,
see how you do with the spear.

243
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,884
That'll work.

244
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,260
Butch on the board.

245
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,929
All right, Alex.

246
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:20,930
Come on, Alex.

247
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,931
Let's go, Alex.

248
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,099
Gotta get inside the green.

249
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,934
Count.

250
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,648
-Yeah, baby! -Good job.
-That'll work.

251
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,149
Alex and Matthew moving on
to the final round.

252
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,317
I'll take it.

253
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,610
Good job, guys.

254
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,611
Let's go, dude.

255
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,445
You and me, baby.

256
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,447
Moving on to
the bow and arrow round.

257
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,116
You guys keep it
here on the bench.

258
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,994
Matt, Alex,
join me in the tower.

259
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,413
Here we go, Matthew.

260
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,497
Take your shot.

261
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,918
Not bad.

262
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,421
Alex.

263
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,840
This guy is a nincompoop.

264
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,929
Alex, you're going to
have to hit it in the yellow,

265
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,180
red or black to win.

266
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,809
-And he does.
-Whoo!

267
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,893
-Boo-yah!
-Alex is drinking coffee.

268
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,311
-Good job, dude.
-Yes.

269
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,646
Good job, buddy. Well done.

270
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,647
-Nice job.
-Thank you.

271
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,690
Alex!

272
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,816
(cheering, applause)

273
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,234
Oh, yeah!

274
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,320
Alex, congratulations, dude.

275
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,238
Thank you, my brother.

276
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,656
-Good job. Good job.
-Hey, that was good.

277
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,116
-Good competition.
-Guys, come on up.

278
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,034
Matthew, you can join them.

279
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,494
All right, Alex, so we have
this Amazon coffee bar.

280
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,204
-Oh, yeah.
-But of course,

281
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,540
one of the best things about
being in a coffee bar is what?

282
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,125
-Hanging out with somebody.
-Hanging out with your friends.

283
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,710
-Yeah. One friend.
-Absolutely.

284
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,628
So, Jenna, let's go
have some coffee.

285
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,629
-Jenna gets her wish.
-(Jenna shrieking)

286
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,214
(Alex laughs)

287
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,008
Guys, nice competition.

288
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,593
Sorry.
You can head back to camp.

289
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,158
Let me present to you your home
for the next few hours.

290
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,243
-Wow. -Nice!
-The Amazon Cafe.

291
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,578
-Very nice.
-Very nice.

292
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,041
ALEX:<i> Going to the coffeehouse</i>
<i>was awesome.</i>

293
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,835
It was this cool little
structure out in the,

294
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,253
out in the jungle.

295
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,254
<i>We had a blast.</i>

296
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,380
Guys, here's to surviving

297
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,882
-25 days in the Amazon.
-Thank you.

298
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,383
Right on.

299
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,384
Everything here is yours.

300
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,260
Have a good afternoon.

301
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,970
-Later, guys.
-Thanks, Jeff. See ya.

302
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,389
Oh, my God.

303
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,058
Mm-hmm.

304
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,808
(grunts)

305
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,687
I'm so happy right now.

306
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,232
This is so cool.

307
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,733
(chuckles)

308
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,360
That is so good.

309
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,071
This is so nice.

310
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,531
To you, for winning.

311
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,282
Thank you very much.

312
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,743
I couldn't have picked a better
person to spend an afternoon

313
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,912
-in the Amazon with.
-Oh, you are far too kind.

314
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,747
JENNA:<i> I really, really</i>
<i>like Alex, and, uh, it was</i>

315
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,041
<i>really nice to, like, spend</i>
<i>time with him and talk to him.</i>

316
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,418
And I was so excited
because I love to eat,

317
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,712
and me and Alex
are like bottomless pits.

318
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,422
<i>We just stuffed our face.</i>

319
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,757
I'm so thankful.

320
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,717
Oh, so am I.

321
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,219
So am I.

322
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,980
Ah!

323
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,481
-Catch something, would you?
-I will.

324
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,983
Okay.

325
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,318
I'm in the mood to do
absolutely friggin' ass nothing.

326
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,612
DEENA:
<i>Reward challenges are great</i>

327
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,948
<i>when you get maybe</i>
<i>a full stomach, whatever.</i>

328
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,701
<i>But it also tells you</i>
<i>who's really here to play.</i>

329
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,578
<i>And unfortunately, it sets</i>

330
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:35,124
those people up
with a really bad position,

331
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,334
à la Alex.

332
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,337
<i>He clearly came out</i>

333
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,298
<i>as a dominant individual.</i>

334
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,925
<i>And that frightened me.</i>

335
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,886
Hey, Heidi, I'm going to lay it
here all on the line for you.

336
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,472
How important is it for you
to advance in this game?

337
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,932
Totally, with all my heart.

338
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,684
All right, well, you tell me
how well you think

339
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,644
you're going to be able
to advance if-if, uh,

340
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,104
Matt or Alex is in this game.

341
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,814
Matt's not in the picture.

342
00:14:58,897 --> 00:14:59,940
I understand that.

343
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,067
What if Matt wins immunity
tomorrow?

344
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,364
I'm talking about
Alex versus Butch.

345
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,158
Who do you have
a better shot against?

346
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,618
Well, definitely against Butch.

347
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,329
So, it seems to me,

348
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,582
if Matt wins immunity,
then Alex has to go.

349
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,421
Wow!

350
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,380
There you go, dear.

351
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,757
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

352
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,550
Any special way to drink this?

353
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,510
-Well...
-We'll just get amped.

354
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,803
Yeah, we're going to be
zinging out of our heads,

355
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,181
and when we come down, like, in
the middle of the night tonight,

356
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,725
we're just going to be, like,
"Oh, my God, I'm gonna die."

357
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,018
(chuckles)

358
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,103
Yeah, we could actually, like,
just sit here and not have to

359
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,355
worry about anybody
overhearing our conversations

360
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,564
and just hang out and...

361
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,650
And actually talk about people
without having to run away.

362
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,651
Mm-hmm.

363
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,860
I would've never expected this

364
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,362
when I started this game.

365
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,363
What?

366
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,031
To meet, like, such cool people.

367
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,032
Yeah.

368
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,702
You and Heidi and Rob
are just so much fun.

369
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,205
It's funny 'cause, like,
us four are, like,

370
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,706
like, the bonding crew.

371
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,667
Totally.

372
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,502
I wonder if Deena knows it.

373
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,045
I don't know
where Deena's at anymore.

374
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,380
I don't, either.

375
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,714
And, like, I-I...

376
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,883
I've been, like,
known her since day one.

377
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,010
-Mm-hmm. -And I don't know
where she's at.

378
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,221
It's hard for her
to get along with us

379
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,724
because she doesn't have the
same-- like, she's very strict.

380
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,850
She's not that much
older than me.

381
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,936
-She's three years older
than me. -But it seems like

382
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,354
-an eternity.
-But she's, like-- Yeah.

383
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,605
She's so different than me.

384
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,108
She just seems to be,
like, trying to, like--

385
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,235
even thinking of, like, another
angle or plot or something.

386
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,236
Yeah. Yeah.

387
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,448
We all have a chance
against one another if it's us.

388
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,117
-Yeah.
-We don't have a chance

389
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,119
-if Alex is in this game.
-Yeah.

390
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,621
I think that the wisest move
is to get rid of

391
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,081
the equal powerhouse.

392
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,251
ROB:<i> I have a alliance</i>
<i>to the end with Deena.</i>

393
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,252
<i>That is a secret.</i>

394
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,253
<i>The other players,</i>

395
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,463
I don't believe,
have any clue that Deena and I

396
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,090
have been working together
and are so close.

397
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,591
Do you think that Jenna
would agree to that?

398
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,635
Yes. I don't have
a problem with Jenna.

399
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,137
I just need to finesse that.

400
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,555
So I will let you know
when it's,

401
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,764
when it's time to talk to Jenna.

402
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,599
ROB:
<i>So it was settled.</i>

403
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,768
<i>If Matt won immunity,</i>

404
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,311
Alex had to go.

405
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,813
They're there.

406
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,481
Yeah, they are.

407
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,566
Uh-oh.

408
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,900
Did you get it stuck?

409
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,737
I either got a bite
or something's caught.

410
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,613
DEENA:<i> I feel as if</i>
<i>we're in control, Rob and I.</i>

411
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,575
<i>Ultimately, I'm in control,</i>
<i>you know, 'cause I always</i>

412
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,619
have a backup plan
after my backup plan fails.

413
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,955
You have to be
thinking 24/7 here,

414
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,666
and it's making my head hurt.

415
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,085
This is getting so interesting.

416
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,592
I'm so full.

417
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,968
Me, too.

418
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,262
(groans)
I'm not worried about, uh,

419
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,972
I'm not worried about eating
any manioc when I get home.

420
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,098
No.

421
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,851
JENNA:<i> I think I drank</i>
<i>four iced coffees,</i>

422
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,311
<i>and we both had</i>
<i>a cappuccino and then</i>

423
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,979
<i>Alex had one more iced coffee.</i>

424
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,314
(slurping)

425
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,483
That's a lot of coffee
in a short amount of time,

426
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,109
so we-we were buzzing.

427
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,329
Let's eat a lot of manioc.

428
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,497
Okay.

429
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,498
I'm so hungry.

430
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,957
I know.

431
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,668
Yes, the fun never stops
here in the Amazon.

432
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,670
Hey, how are you guys?

433
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,671
How are you?

434
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,466
Oh, we missed you.

435
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,884
We have an announcement.

436
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,177
Um, first off,

437
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,515
Jenna and I would like to, uh,
say that we're more than willing

438
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,518
to take at least the first two
fire watch shifts 'cause

439
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,520
her four cups of coffee
and my five

440
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,731
pretty much guarantees no sleep
for quite some time.

441
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,566
-Yada, yada, yada.
-But if you could all

442
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,861
just take a seat
over here for a minute.

443
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,030
Um, good thing about being

444
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,324
-(cheering)
-at the cafe

445
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,369
is that cookies
can actually travel.

446
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,037
So everybody gets two cookies.

447
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,330
They kind of broke.

448
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,373
That's all we could make,

449
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,625
that's all we could
make it out of there with.

450
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,710
But I wanted to make sure that
there was some for everybody.

451
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,711
Thank you.

452
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,964
-Thanks.
-So enjoy them.

453
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,048
Enjoy them, my friends.

454
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,341
I'd just like to say,
for the record,

455
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,884
-that I don't approve of this.
-Okay.

456
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,220
(laughter)

457
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,888
ROB:<i> When Alex and Jenna</i>
<i>came back from</i>

458
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,391
<i>the reward challenge,</i>
<i>they brought back two cookies</i>

459
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,185
for each of us,
which was a very nice gesture

460
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,020
and much appreciated
by the tribe.

461
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,856
But Matt and Butch
were in the boat,

462
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,566
and they didn't know
there were any cookies.

463
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,234
There's, uh, there's
a little bit there

464
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,569
for the two of them to grub on.

465
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,362
Yeah, there's two cookies there.

466
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,363
We could eat all the cookies.

467
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,741
Hey, hey-- ♪ La, la, la,
la, la, la, la... ♪

468
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,577
I was very fair.

469
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,745
ROB:<i> I thought that</i>
<i>we could just eat the cookies</i>

470
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,581
and Matt and Butch
wouldn't know.

471
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,750
I mean, they're really on the
outside looking in, power-wise.

472
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,961
Even if they found out,
what are they going to do?

473
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,550
Oh. Son of a...

474
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,428
Man, I want to catch
some ... damn fish.

475
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,305
BUTCH:<i> Matt and I have been</i>
<i>trying to catch fish.</i>

476
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,391
<i>And we caught 12 fish</i>
<i>the first day we were here.</i>

477
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,809
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>we caught six fish.</i>

478
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,977
<i>We caught one this morning.</i>

479
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,978
We fished for three hours.

480
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,105
It got so hot out there,
we could hardly take it.

481
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,315
Here we go.

482
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,236
Oh, oh.

483
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,446
Dude, he took my bait.

484
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,488
The bastard.

485
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,950
Got something going here.

486
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,619
Got him.

487
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,203
-Got one.
-Bring it in.

488
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,164
Good job, dude.

489
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,290
Got him.

490
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,750
Awesome.

491
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,128
Nice... Nice-size piranha, dude.

492
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:16,256
Piranhas have real sharp teeth
and they're really long.

493
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,926
<i>I had one on the boat,</i>
<i>and I stabbed him in the head</i>

494
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,137
<i>two times with my knife, had</i>
<i>already cut him all the way up,</i>

495
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,015
<i>and I was getting ready</i>
<i>to turn him over to skin him...</i>

496
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,600
Ow! Got bit.

497
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,770
Bad?

498
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,979
<i>It hurt.</i>
<i>And that fish was dead.</i>

499
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,315
<i>I don't know, it must have</i>
<i>just saw my finger,</i>

500
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,775
<i>come right around and bit me.</i>

501
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,943
<i>Yeah, that was stupid of me,</i>

502
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:40,155
but I thought the fish was dead,
and he had one last bite.

503
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:41,490
MATTHEW:
<i>How bad?</i>

504
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,824
Eh, he nailed me.

505
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,451
He got me pretty good.

506
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,560
Good news first:
we caught fish.

507
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,855
Bad news:
a few small, puny fish.

508
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,857
-We brought you back
some cookies. -Boo-yah!

509
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,693
-Oh, you guys are the best, man.
-Thank you.

510
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,028
I mean, they kind of
didn't travel well.

511
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,655
Everyone's gotten theirs
except for the two of you.

512
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,656
You got to split this up.

513
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,199
I'm sorry I could not
take you with me, Matt,

514
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,034
but I did promise Jenna.

515
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,412
You know, promises are really
what it's all about.

516
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,915
We'll be right back.
We're gonna go to the bathroom.

517
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:36,044
ROB:<i> Deena had told Heidi</i>
<i>not to say anything to Jenna</i>

518
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,839
<i>about Deena's plans</i>
<i>to get rid of Alex.</i>

519
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,881
<i>But following</i>

520
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,884
Alex and Jenna's return
from the reward challenge,

521
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,053
<i>Heidi told Jenna everything.</i>

522
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,389
(whispering):
Yes, I do... I don't know...

523
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,391
HEIDI:<i> Alex and Jenna</i>
<i>were my original alliance.</i>

524
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,351
<i>I'm not going to turn</i>
<i>my back on them.</i>

525
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,937
<i>So, I mean,</i>
<i>I just told Jenna about it,</i>

526
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,064
and I knew she'd
speak to Alex about it.

527
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,859
So, wait,
what did Heidi say to you?

528
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,778
Heidi said that
she-she ... turned on us,

529
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,407
so we need
to get her off after Matt.

530
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,825
How did Heidi find this out?

531
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,869
I guess, Deena said something
to her and, like...

532
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,579
JENNA:<i> Deena stabbed us all</i>
<i>in the back</i>

533
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,080
<i>because she's being selfish.</i>

534
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,874
<i>I'm really pissed at her.</i>

535
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,083
She's obviously trouble.

536
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,085
She's starting trouble already.

537
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,087
That doesn't need
to happen around the camp.

538
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,630
We still got two days.

539
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,257
-But I'm-I'm worried about Rob.
-Butch, Butch...

540
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,675
Why would Rob pick her over us?

541
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,260
Because, see, I know
he gave her a word.

542
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,137
ALEX:<i> And so, I grabbed Rob,</i>
<i>and I was, like,</i>

543
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,388
"Rob, dude, what's going on?"

544
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,723
He goes, "What do you mean?"

545
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,099
I was, like,
"So, now, I'm on list?

546
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,267
I'm-- My head's on the block?"

547
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,393
He says, "How do you know that?

548
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,103
That just happened this
afternoon while you were gone."

549
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,438
I was, like,
"Dude, 'cause I'm good.

550
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,564
I know what's going on."

551
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,899
<i>And he was, like, "Yeah.</i>

552
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,568
<i>Deena wants to get rid of</i>
<i>Matt next, and then you."</i>

553
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,111
She wants you done
sooner than later.

554
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,529
Dude, you know what?

555
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,114
Here's-Here's my,
here's my plan then.

556
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,449
Mm-hmm.

557
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,785
In two days, we vote off Matt.

558
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,788
Three days after that,
we keep Christy

559
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,958
and we keep Butch
and we get rid of Deena.

560
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,959
ROB:
<i>Things have</i>

561
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:02,422
really gotten interesting
over here at Jacaré.

562
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,760
<i>It's Deena versus Alex,</i>
<i>and both think that</i>

563
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,512
they're calling the shots
in this game.

564
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,830
HEIDI:
<i>I feel so retarded right now</i>

565
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,165
<i>because of some spider bite.</i>

566
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,792
Oh, wow.

567
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,961
It's getting bad.

568
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,504
-Can't bend it at all?
-Uh-uh.

569
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,047
-What's the status?
-I don't know.

570
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,257
I mean, it just won't bend now.

571
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,260
Like, I mean, it was such
a sharp pain, I almost lost it.

572
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,680
<i>It started off sore, and it</i>
<i>started turning black and blue.</i>

573
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:56,852
I am not even able to touch
my knee without extreme pain.

574
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,354
I mean, I literally
cannot bend it.

575
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:02,190
Your-Your knee is hot from here.

576
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,442
It-It's... pretty much to here.

577
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,819
You want me to carry you over
and put you down over there?

578
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,195
No, no, I'll-I'll walk.

579
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,533
ROB:<i> Heidi has been bitten by</i>
<i>some insect, and it has now</i>

580
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,828
reached the size of
one of her breasts on her knee,

581
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,247
<i>so it's very hard for her</i>
<i>to walk around.</i>

582
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,916
<i>Hopefully,</i>
<i>she'll have it drained.</i>

583
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,751
Stupid bugs.

584
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,795
(laughs)

585
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,807
Let's see
what's in the old mailbox.

586
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,559
Treemail.

587
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,727
Oh, yes.

588
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,020
What do you got?

589
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,521
Is it something fun?

590
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,858
"What do you crave more,
immunity or food?"

591
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,692
I'm eating.

592
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,028
"The thought of
going home tonight

593
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,279
"might put your palate

594
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,614
-in the mood."
-In the mood.

595
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,907
What's that mean?

596
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,241
That I don't understand.

597
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,784
-Oh, wait. No. I don't know.
-No.

598
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,078
I'm confused.
Maybe I'm just an idiot.

599
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,413
-This says right here...
-Great.

600
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,249
..."immunity or food."

601
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,877
No, I'm hungry.

602
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,421
The plan leading up to
the immunity challenge

603
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,799
has always been Matt first, Matt
first, Matt first, Matt first.

604
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,927
"What do you crave more,
immunity or food?"

605
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,303
Dur.

606
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:17,265
<i>But we've decided and we've</i>
<i>agreed, if Matt wins immunity,</i>

607
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,892
<i>Alex must go.</i>

608
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,227
He's gone.

609
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,770
Period, end of statement.

610
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,605
I'm so ready for--

611
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,981
-Let's go now.
-(chuckling)

612
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,608
Anybody feel like canoeing?

613
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,152
You keep eating the manioc.

614
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,033
Come on in, guys.

615
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,744
Got a wrapped knee.

616
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,079
-Thank you so much.
-Uh-huh.

617
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:41,873
What happened?

618
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,125
We believe a spider.

619
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,335
Stupid spiders.
(chuckles)

620
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,797
So, in a physical competition,
you're in trouble right now.

621
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,798
Slightly.

622
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,591
We've all gotten bit.

623
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,426
27 days you've been out here.

624
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,928
Not bad.

625
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,554
And probably, from day one,
the most common thought

626
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,597
-in your head has been...
-Food.

627
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,266
-Food. Mmm.
-Food.

628
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,017
-I'll be the first to say.
-Oh, yes.

629
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,852
You want food,
today you're getting food.

630
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:03,853
Oh! All of us?

631
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,980
-Nice.
-Yes.

632
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,648
There's a catch, guys.

633
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,150
We've prepared a nice
Amazonian menu for you.

634
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,318
Many of the items on the menu

635
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,320
are actually things that can be
found in your own camp.

636
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,532
They're all delicacies in the
Amazon, and, more importantly,

637
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,993
in a survival situation,
they are a necessity.

638
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,286
There will be four courses.

639
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,664
The last two people to finish
their food in each round will be

640
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,291
eliminated until we're left
with the final two.

641
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,960
Last one left standing
wins immunity.

642
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,421
Speaking of which,
give it up, Jenna.

643
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,675
I know that's nice to have
around the neck.

644
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,010
Do well today,
you can have it again.

645
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,012
Immunity is back up for grabs.

646
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,180
We will draw numbers
to determine

647
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,308
your order at the table,
and we'll get started.

648
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,851
Hope you brought an appetite.

649
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,855
Okay, go ahead
and take off your tops.

650
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,357
-Okay. -These are
Amazonian grasshoppers.

651
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,359
They're a little larger than
a traditional grasshopper

652
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,154
and, I might add,
a little tastier, as well.

653
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,238
Have you tried one?

654
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,614
-I certainly have.
-Nice.

655
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,449
So here's the rule.

656
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,868
You need to show me
an empty mouth.

657
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,828
Now, once I've said you're good,

658
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,747
if it comes back up,
that's okay.

659
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,707
But you gotta get it down
for me to see it.

660
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,709
-I can't eat this.
-The first six

661
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,503
to finish their grasshopper
move on to the next round.

662
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,088
The last two are out.

663
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,090
-Everybody ready?
-Yep. -Yeah.

664
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,216
Survivors ready?

665
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,260
Go.

666
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,894
It's a little dry.

667
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,062
Mm-hmm.

668
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,688
-I'd say so.
-And once you finish

669
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,732
and I say you're good,
step away from the table.

670
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,069
Christy having a little trouble.

671
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,737
Heidi's trying
to convince herself.

672
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,740
Mind over matter.
Mind over matter.

673
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,741
Matthew's in.

674
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,077
You're good, step back.

675
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,703
Looking for five more.

676
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,040
(gagging, coughing)

677
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,375
Keep it down.

678
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,128
Deena, you're good.

679
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,255
Uh-uh, I'm not going
any farther.

680
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,382
Ah!

681
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,966
Alex, you're good.
That's three.

682
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,760
Looking for three more.

683
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,763
-It's really dry.
-Rob working on it.

684
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,264
-It's dry. I mean...
-It's hard to swallow.

685
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,141
-It doesn't taste that bad.
-You got it down, good.

686
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,603
Christy, get the rest in.

687
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,731
Keep it down.

688
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,067
(gagging)

689
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,777
Sorry. I'd rather have manioc.

690
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,195
Y-You're that confident
about immunity?

691
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,613
No, I just can't eat it.

692
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,782
Rob, you're, you're
still a ways away.

693
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,077
You got half
that grasshopper left.

694
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,454
-How you doing, Butch?
-I'm enjoying it.

695
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,082
Go, you got it, Christy.
Do it.

696
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,291
Ooh, crunchy.

697
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,584
(gagging)

698
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,420
Come on, Heidi.

699
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,462
I just gotta get it down.

700
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,089
-It's hard to swallow.
-Mm-hmm.

701
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,967
It is a bit hard
to swallow, man.

702
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,802
You're good.
That's four.

703
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,928
Two more moving on.

704
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,304
-Jenna's already...
-(retching)

705
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,681
-Oh, no.
-That's good, Butch.

706
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,474
Christy, it's you and Heidi.

707
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,560
Swallow it, Heidi.

708
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,357
That's it.

709
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,608
Christy's in.

710
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,318
Christy's in by a second, Heidi.

711
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,445
Good try, Heidi.

712
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,446
Good try.

713
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,697
(retching)

714
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,158
Heidi and Jenna,
have a seat on the bench.

715
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,325
Guys ready for the next round?

716
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,952
-Mm-hmm.
-Open up.

717
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,328
See if these look familiar.

718
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,830
You have ten babassu worms.

719
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,747
These are coconut worms.

720
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,291
You guys have had these
at camp, I'm sure.

721
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,500
Now it's just a matter of

722
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,710
getting ten down the fastest.

723
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,837
Four of you will move on.

724
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,505
Two will not move on.

725
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,007
-Everybody ready?
-Mm-hmm.

726
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,091
Survivors ready?

727
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,509
Go.

728
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,345
-Matthew's in.
-All right, Matt.

729
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,222
Deena is in.

730
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,265
Alex is in.

731
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,683
That's it.

732
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,852
-Christy's in.
-Mm, mm, mm!

733
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,853
Rob and Butch, you're out.

734
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,563
Sorry, buddy.

735
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,023
You gonna go ahead
and finish, Rob?

736
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,733
-I like them.
-Here's the deal.

737
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,359
Two of you will move on
to the final.

738
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,153
Two of you will be out.

739
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,988
Go ahead and take off your tops.

740
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,199
Oh, blech.

741
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,200
-Five beetles.
-Oh, God.

742
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,410
Medium-size. They're not large.

743
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,411
That's disgusting.

744
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,829
Oh,<i> marone.</i>
(laughs)

745
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,872
Baked.

746
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,332
A little crispy.

747
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,666
Survivors ready?

748
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,792
Go.

749
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:11,392
(gagging)

750
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,560
Christy having trouble.

751
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,395
Get 'em down, Christy.

752
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,689
That-a-way, Deena.

753
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,983
Matthew looking good.

754
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,693
Hurry.

755
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,278
Nobody rushing.

756
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,280
-Hurry, hurry.
-Let's see. Show it to me.

757
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,907
-Hurry, hurry, hurry.
-Down, down, down. That's good.

758
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,908
Matthew's in.

759
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,493
Looking for one more.

760
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,454
-Hurry! -Between Christy,
Deena and Alex.

761
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,414
Get it down.

762
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:35,750
Come on.

763
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,085
-Deena's close.
-Come on.

764
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,419
(gagging)

765
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,671
Come on, Christy.

766
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,715
Deena is in.

767
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,259
Christy's throwing up.

768
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,135
Christy and Alex, you're out.

769
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,973
The final round,
the final course.

770
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,934
One for you, Deena.

771
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,311
Specially prepared
for you, Matthew.

772
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,479
Mm-hmm.

773
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,731
They ordered ahead
just for you, Mateo.

774
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,691
Thank God.

775
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,943
Okay, comes down to this.

776
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,486
One final course.

777
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,572
Immunity at stake.

778
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,282
You guys have proven you can eat
pretty much anything.

779
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,950
Take a look at your last course.

780
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,077
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

781
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,787
-What is it?
-What is it?

782
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,955
That is just nasty-ass.

783
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,123
-Let me see.
-What do you got?

784
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,583
-Show it.
-It's alive.

785
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,792
-What is it?
-It's a big grub.

786
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,419
It's just a big, old nasty--
what is it?

787
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,087
-Oh, that's foul.
-Big grub and it's alive

788
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,255
and it's got big teeth.

789
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,506
Sweet, dude!

790
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,591
And it's got really sharp claws.

791
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,967
Put it back down now.

792
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,137
Beetle larva found
in the trunks of dead trees.

793
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,597
Very common out here.

794
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,931
The only difference is
it's alive.

795
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,183
It's not been
baked or barbecued.

796
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,437
We've taken the pinchers off,
so it won't hurt you going down.

797
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,314
Here we go.

798
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,609
For immunity, Deena and Matthew.

799
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,444
It's real simple, guys:
get it down first

800
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,154
or you could be in trouble
at Tribal Council.

801
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,905
Huge stakes. Here we go.

802
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,825
Survivors ready?

803
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,243
Go.

804
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,832
-Wow, you swallowed it whole?
-(cheering)

805
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,334
-Yes!
-(whooping)

806
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,668
You didn't even kill it?

807
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,672
-Good job, Matt. -Wow!
-That thing is

808
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,715
still working its way down.

809
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,342
I'm hoping my digestive juices

810
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,843
are going to do battle
and hopefully win.

811
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,386
-This guy is crazy.
-Dude, that was awesome!

812
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,512
You are nuts.

813
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,972
(howling)

814
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,724
Hey, hey, wave, guys.

815
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,477
(cheering)

816
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:20,855
Yeah, baby!

817
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:21,856
Yeah!

818
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,024
All right, Matt.

819
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,860
You are safe
from the vote tonight.

820
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,820
-Cool. Thanks a lot.
-Nice effort.

821
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,323
Everybody else,
you know the drill.

822
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,200
Somebody's going home.
You can head back to camp.

823
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,203
I'll see you at Tribal later.

824
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,392
I'll be right back, guys.
I'm gonna...

825
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,268
we're going to wash.

826
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,191
DEENA:<i> The mistake that Alex</i>
<i>made at the immunity challenge</i>

827
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,527
<i>was to lose</i>
<i>the immunity challenge.</i>

828
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,611
<i>Alex needed to win</i>

829
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,071
to save his heinie.

830
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,322
Didn't happen.

831
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,866
<i>My ass really had to have</i>
<i>been on the line today</i>

832
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,119
<i>for me to have eaten</i>
<i>that grotesque thing.</i>

833
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,287
<i>If everybody is still with me,</i>

834
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,039
why even try?

835
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,916
So what's going on?

836
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:25,753
Um, Alex is, by far,
the next in line.

837
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,756
Alex has to go next.

838
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,757
Next.

839
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,050
Okay.

840
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,427
That's understandable,
'cause when...

841
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,262
<i>I convinced Jenna</i>

842
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,266
<i>Alex is too great of a threat,</i>
<i>so he's gone.</i>

843
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,810
(singsongy):
Bye-bye, Alex. Bye-bye, Alex.

844
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,854
I'm-- we're completely
in control of this.

845
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:43,938
Oh, yeah.

846
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:44,939
So you're with me, right?

847
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,232
-Yeah.
-Okay, pinky swear.

848
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,192
-All right.
-So...

849
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,821
JENNA:<i> Deena's been</i>
<i>in alliance with me and Alex</i>

850
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,781
<i>and Rob and Heidi,</i>
<i>but she stabbed us all</i>

851
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,074
in the back, and I am

852
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,618
so incredibly disappointed
and shocked.

853
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,370
And I can't ever forgive that.

854
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,795
So, this is the first time I've
been pissed off in this game.

855
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,838
-Mm-hmm.
-You, too?

856
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,132
I'm just tired of
sitting on those logs all day.

857
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,634
Deena took me aside
and talked to me.

858
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,927
What'd she say?

859
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,471
You know, Alex needs to go next.

860
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,016
She wants the final four to be
you, Heidi, Christy and her.

861
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,935
She just wants all the girls--
all the guys gone first.

862
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,104
She told me, quote,
"We control this game."

863
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,273
And I was like, hmm,
you've said that to everybody.

864
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,483
Mm-hmm.

865
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:33,196
She's like, "I have Rob around
my finger and he has Matt."

866
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,949
So that's where it stands
at this point.

867
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,952
It's just... if Rob turns on us,
then we're screwed.

868
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,537
That's true.

869
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,164
...the cat?

870
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,208
Ah!

871
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,296
ROB:<i> I'm sort of in both circles</i>
<i>in all this right now.</i>

872
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,883
<i>I get information</i>
<i>from Deena and Alex, too,</i>

873
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,219
which is sort of
a precarious position to be in,

874
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,512
'cause it could backfire.

875
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,264
Alex is a, is a greater threat,
only because

876
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,142
he's gonna make a power play
with the girls to get rid of us.

877
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,352
Right.

878
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,394
I don't want that to happen.

879
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,687
Okay.

880
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,190
And you have more control over
the Butch and Matt thing because

881
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,525
they can be led
in different directions

882
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,859
-to vote for whomever.
-Yeah.

883
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,821
DEENA:<i> Rob is doing his own</i>
<i>little work with, uh, Matt,</i>

884
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,365
<i>and Matt, of course,</i>
<i>then, will talk with Butch.</i>

885
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,991
<i>And so it all kind of--</i>

886
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,409
our little fingers
are out reaching,

887
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,203
and it's all falling into place.

888
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,372
Girls are playing their part.

889
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,832
(sighs)
Whew!

890
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,709
So... we'll do it.

891
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,710
Do Alex next?

892
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,087
I think so.

893
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,591
ROB:<i> Deena and Alex both think</i>
<i>they have the exact same people</i>

894
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,385
<i>to vote the other one off.</i>

895
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,095
<i>And both think that their plan</i>

896
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,056
<i>is going to work</i>
<i>without a hitch.</i>

897
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,934
It's like we're in the Mob,
and that there's gonna be a hit

898
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,895
on one of my friends,
and I really have to look

899
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,898
the other way and act like
everything's hunky-dory.

900
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,734
But when we go to
Tribal Council tonight,

901
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,028
the one person
that's gonna get the hit tonight

902
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,239
is gonna be the person
that least expects it.

903
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,058
Welcome to Tribal Council.

904
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,729
We'll now bring in
the first member of our jury.

905
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,982
Dave is here only to observe.

906
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,903
Just gathering information to
help in a very important vote.

907
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,618
Heidi, what the heck
is going on with your knee?

908
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,620
(laughs):
I wish I knew.

909
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,121
I mean,
it's getting better, though.

910
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,789
It's getting better,
and I think honestly,

911
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,791
probably in two days,
I-I'll be good to go.

912
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,126
Did it concern you at all?

913
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,794
-I mean, this is
an individual game. -Yes!

914
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,962
Oh, my gosh, yes.

915
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,923
I'm sitting here,
okay, my strongest

916
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,966
assets to this group are

917
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,760
athletic ability
and intelligence.

918
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:04,639
And, hello, one of those
is gone right now.

919
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,641
-Which one?
-(laughter)

920
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,559
Well, uh, that's
a very good question.

921
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,314
Deena, now that we are in
the jury phase of this game,

922
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,276
have you noticed
any palpable change in the game?

923
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,195
Game is on.

924
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,322
People are jockeying
for positions.

925
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,325
There is a struggle for--
and I wouldn't say power--

926
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,118
but there's a struggle
to see who has power.

927
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,954
You bet. Absolutely a change.

928
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,497
People are a little on edge.

929
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,291
It's no longer about
survival in the Amazon.

930
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,461
It's survival
in the<i> Survivor</i> game.

931
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,713
Alex, you start to notice,

932
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,216
or maybe think you're noticing,
people whispering

933
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,176
or pairing off a little more
often than they used to?

934
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,303
To some extent, sure.

935
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,639
You can't help but get
a little bit paranoid.

936
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,058
And you start asking yourself
questions about, like,

937
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,936
whether or not ethics
enters into the game or not.

938
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,479
Do you stab someone in the back?

939
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,564
It's a balancing act, for sure.

940
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,650
See what happens.

941
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,820
Matthew, how important
was immunity for you to have?

942
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,240
Immunity was a nice thing
to have today,

943
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:08,160
but for me, uh, personally,
based on what I know

944
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,204
about the tribe
and, uh, feelings

945
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,872
and the mood of the tribe,

946
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,542
it wasn't, uh,
absolutely essential.

947
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,211
Hmm. So are you willing
to negotiate for it?

948
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,379
No.

949
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,922
(laughter)

950
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,590
Alex, how nice would it be

951
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,384
for you to have
that necklace tonight?

952
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,885
I'd love to have that necklace.

953
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,470
I want to finish this game.

954
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,055
I want to win this game.

955
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,683
I don't get into competitions
to go, "Eh, that's cool.

956
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,684
I'm done now."

957
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,768
It's not why I do it.

958
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:37,356
And if my name comes up,
well, then my name comes up.

959
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,858
I don't have
any control over it.

960
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,735
Deena, feel good about
how you played the game?

961
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,902
Thus far, yes.

962
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,197
If my name comes up, it would
have come down to a bug.

963
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,032
I mean, essentially,

964
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,200
okay, spawned out of
the pit of hell,

965
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,119
but that thing-- that's what
separates Matt and I,

966
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,081
is swallowing
one giant, ugly grub.

967
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,250
It is time to vote.

968
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,501
Christy, you're first.

969
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,096
I vote for Alex tonight,

970
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,599
because he's a serious threat
to the tribe,

971
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,602
so I'm trying
to get rid of him tonight.

972
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,742
You lied to me, you betrayed me,
you screwed me.

973
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,826
Now screw you.

974
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,921
'Cause you are a mental
and physical powerhouse,

975
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,090
you're standing between me
and the big prize.

976
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,815
Deena, you couldn't even stick
by your word for three days.

977
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,317
I'd actually love to go up
against you in court any day,

978
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,654
'cause you're the worst liar I
think I've ever met in my life.

979
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,807
I'll go tally the votes.

980
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,194
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

981
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,654
Person voted out will be asked

982
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,322
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

983
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,324
I'll read the votes.

984
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,704
First vote:

985
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,038
Deena.

986
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,336
Deena.

987
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,589
Two votes Deena.

988
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,385
Alex.

989
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,055
Alex.

990
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,975
Two votes Alex, two votes Deena.

991
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,439
Three votes Deena.

992
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,027
That's four votes Deena,
two votes Alex.

993
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,408
Ninth person voted out,
the second member of our jury:

994
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:35,910
Deena.

995
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,411
That's five, and that's enough.

996
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,413
Need to bring me your torch.

997
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:42,208
No need to read the last vote.

998
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,301
Deena, the tribe has spoken.

999
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,222
It's time for you to go.

1000
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,196
Well, you've survived
nine Tribal Councils,

1001
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,989
lasted 27 days.

1002
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:14,990
You're doing something right.

1003
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,618
These last 12 days
will raise one very simple

1004
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,622
but important question:
How badly do you want it?

1005
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,793
And what will you
or won't you do to get it?

1006
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,419
Guys can head back to camp.

1007
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,213
Good night.

1008
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,894
<i>Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

1009
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,113
They saw me as a threat,
and I wanted to change

1010
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,823
the, uh, the face
of the game a little bit

1011
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,658
<i>and vote off the people</i>
<i>that were the strongest</i>

1012
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,576
<i>so that we could</i>
<i>finish off until the end.</i>

1013
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,745
<i>Things happen,</i>
<i>people change their minds,</i>

1014
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,124
<i>relationships grow, and there's</i>
<i>attachments, so I got nixed.</i>

1015
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,251
<i>But remember that you're</i>
<i>going to have to live with</i>

1016
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,669
<i>the decisions</i>
<i>for the rest of your life,</i>

1017
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,795
<i>so make sure that they count.</i>

1018
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:10,838
Thanks for the ride.

1019
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,006
I had a good time.
