translated from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:00,958 --> 00:00:03,144
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:05,137
The Ta Keo prospered

4
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:07,273
and had formed a solid quintet...

5
00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:08,909
We are the final quintet.

6
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:11,315
I try to recruit
as many people as possible.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,721
...while the
Angkors barely made it.

8
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:15,501
We are in hell.
It does not work.

9
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:17,454
But at the last
immunity test...

10
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,592
Woo tire.

11
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:20,026
...they finally won...

12
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:21,821
Angkor wins immunity!

13
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:24,190
...sending Bayon to the council.

14
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,500
On the field,

15
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,869
Wiglesworth and Spencer
were in the minority.

16
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:30,738
I stay on Kelly.

17
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:32,707
But Monica wanted change.

18
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,077
We might want
to preserve the female workforce.

19
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,320
She is unpredictable
and will switch sides.

20
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:40,406
And indeed, everything changed in the council,

21
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:42,717
when Monica was taken by surprise.

22
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:44,677
Monica, the tribe has spoken.

23
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,283
There are 15 left.

24
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:49,741
Who will be eliminated tonight?

25
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:36,946
Terry !

26
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,067
Alright, c'est Probst!

27
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:42,501
- My friend, I need to talk to you.
- OK.

28
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:43,636
Come.

29
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:46,629
We'll be right back.

30
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:49,340
- Come to the beach.
- OK.

31
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:58,019
I got a call from your wife.

32
00:01:58,144 --> 00:02:00,719
Your son, Danny...

33
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:03,059
He's at the hospital.

34
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:06,067
Your wife and the doctor

35
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,338
think
it's serious enough

36
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:11,564
for you to come
in to be present.

37
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,768
I know it's a shock,
waking up in the middle of the night.

38
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:19,238
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't serious.

39
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:21,179
No hesitation.

40
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:23,584
I'm going to get my bag

41
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,521
and uh... tell them.

42
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,345
- Fine, let's go.
- And then we go.

43
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,305
- I accompany you.
- Ok thank you.

44
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:37,022
- What's going on ?
- Everybody is here ?

45
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:38,491
How are you ?

46
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:40,939
My boy, Danny,

47
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,947
he was hospitalized.

48
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:47,466
My wife and the doctor

49
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,941
think it would be better
for me to go home.

50
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,603
- Oh my God !
- Oh Terry!

51
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:54,448
For me, there was no hesitation.

52
00:02:58,556 --> 00:02:59,559
Terry !

53
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:03,413
I appreciate you all, and everything...

54
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,000
You helped me...

55
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,791
Helped fulfill
a new dream, and...

56
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:11,903
I couldn't have done it

57
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:14,460
without the wonderful people
that you are. Admirable.

58
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:15,710
We love you.

59
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,824
Thank you very much for everything.

60
00:03:19,057 --> 00:03:21,054
I'll just take my bag.

61
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:25,838
You have to be a parent
to understand the shock of being here

62
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:29,383
and to learn that your child
is sick, that you have to go home.

63
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:35,623
I can only imagine.

64
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,238
Be well, good luck,
give them a beating!

65
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:42,196
- Everything will be fine, Terry!
- Good luck !

66
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,089
- I will miss you.
- You also.

67
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:48,163
Having to leave like this
is worse than a medical evacuation,

68
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:51,052
worse than anything you can
imagine in Survivor.

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,565
It reminds us

70
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,209
how quickly
things can change.

71
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:57,111
Let's win for Terry.

72
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:58,982
Let's win for him.

73
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,727
I don't like being
cold in the back like this.

74
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,878
Hold fast.
We'll take you home.

75
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:07,947
I sympathize.

76
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:09,397
He's a good father.

77
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:11,143
We will think of him

78
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:15,162
Hoping that it will be fine,
that everything will be fine when he returns.

79
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,138
Over here, everyone!

80
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:47,057
Angkor, discover
the new Bayon tribe.

81
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,918
Monica, eliminated at the last council.

82
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:05,643
Angkor and Bayon, discover
the new Ta Keo tribe.

83
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:07,100
Quoi ?

84
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:08,537
Sans Terry.

85
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:13,417
Terry Deitz was pulled from the game
following a family emergency.

86
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,320
Oh no !

87
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:19,181
His wife called,
one of his children is sick.

88
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,258
He had to go home.

89
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:22,616
Oh my God !

90
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:25,374
- Savage, you're a father.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:29,260
Imagine learning in the middle of the night
that your child has a problem,

92
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:30,763
and you don't know what.

93
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:32,327
I would run to the airport.

94
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:34,696
We are all
fans of this game,

95
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:38,174
but family
is more important than all that.

96
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:39,301
Wiglesworth.

97
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,621
Can you explain

98
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:42,471
to someone who has no children

99
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,248
what is this instinct?

100
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:45,841
You have it, Savage has it.

101
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:47,495
We would do anything for his child.

102
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,546
If necessary, if it was faster, I would
swim.

103
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,983
That Terry left like this...
We all sympathize.

104
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:56,452
It's awful.

105
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,953
Ciera,

106
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:00,297
you are a young mother, too.

107
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:02,166
How do you react ?

108
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,326
We discussed with my husband,

109
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,753
of what could bring me home.

110
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,006
I love this game,

111
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:11,266
but I love my family infinitely more .

112
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:16,920
Joe, what is the impact on you
as a tribe?

113
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,373
I think last night

114
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:20,375
it hit us all.

115
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:24,213
But the game goes on,
and Terry will be proud of us.

116
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:27,116
How are the other two tribes doing?
Bayon?

117
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:29,995
How's the vibe
at your place, Jeremy?

118
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,770
We are a small family.

119
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:34,278
Savage, has this tribe
grown stronger?

120
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:36,585
Despite the many
difficulties encountered?

121
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,027
This quartet is incredibly tight,

122
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,441
we can't wait to continue
our winning streak.

123
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:45,634
I'm glad to know

124
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,781
that we have
three close-knit tribes.

125
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:52,908
Because the amazing thing about Survivor
is that the game never stops.

126
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,386
So today is absolutely perfect

127
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:56,858
for a mix of teams.

128
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:00,567
Everybody throw down their bandana,

129
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:02,675
one more time !

130
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:05,587
We love you Terry.

131
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:10,674
The three most beautiful
words in the world, for me:

132
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,162
"Throw away your bandanas."

133
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:18,033
There will be two tribes:
Ta Keo and Bayon.

134
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,993
Angkor no longer exists.

135
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,940
Everybody,

136
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:26,375
unpack your bandanas.

137
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:39,163
Savage had Ta Keo, I was delighted.

138
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:42,782
Because if I had to choose
someone I was very close to,

139
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,793
it was Savage, without hesitation.

140
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:48,397
Take a seat on your new mats.

141
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,526
There have been two mixes now.

142
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:53,014
There are so
many past relationships,

143
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,280
I can't see
how people will associate.

144
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:58,874
It's a beautiful... Add a swear word.

145
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:00,618
Welcome to your home !

146
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:06,381
Kass. You threw away your bandana,

147
00:08:06,506 --> 00:08:08,664
fired another Ta Keo,
and there you are again.

148
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,362
I'm happy,
because we have the rice and the chicken.

149
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:13,858
I have some doubts about Spencer,
because hey, you know...

150
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:15,742
We don't necessarily like each other very much.

151
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:17,092
In the heart of the matter!

152
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:19,770
Let's go !

153
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:21,797
Kass and I had a fight,

154
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:24,102
and at times we hated each other.

155
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,869
So, my agreement
with my sworn enemy

156
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,429
will determine my future in this game.

157
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:32,111
Wentworth,
in a new group of seven,

158
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:34,885
six of which were together at the start.

159
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:38,389
Do you immediately think
that you will be left out?

160
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:40,611
I'm the only original Ta Keo,
I know.

161
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:44,477
But I know some of them,
we collaborated in the last tribe.

162
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:46,989
So I'm excited
and I just want to win.

163
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:49,617
This mix is ​​perfect for me.

164
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:51,500
We have a perfect target in Wentworth.

165
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,127
But I always feel

166
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,780
to run a risk.

167
00:08:56,142 --> 00:09:00,007
Because we have a lot
of dominant males.

168
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:01,879
It terrifies me.

169
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:05,649
Ready for your first
reward event

170
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:07,600
- as new tribes?
- Yes !

171
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:09,078
Today,

172
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:11,080
one member of each tribe

173
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,462
set off on a slippery course,

174
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,584
grabbing a ring along the way.

175
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,806
You will then try
to reach a pole by throwing it.

176
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,843
The first to succeed
scores a point.

177
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:23,492
The first tribe to three
wins the reward.

178
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,810
- Do you want to know what's at stake?
- Yes sir !

179
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:28,430
It will be a good way
to get to know each other.

180
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:31,642
A Survivor-style picnic,
delivered to your camp.

181
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:33,001
You chicken free,

182
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:35,483
pasta gratin,

183
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:38,474
and for dessert, brownies.

184
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,046
All is said.

185
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:46,190
One minute to get organized
and we'll get started.

186
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,834
Well, on and go.

187
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,855
For starters, Ta Keo,
who do you line up?

188
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,394
It will be Savage

189
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:57,476
against Jeremy,

190
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,094
in this first round.

191
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:02,317
The first to place
his ring on the post

192
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:03,474
scores a point.

193
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,733
It takes three.

194
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:05,872
Let's go.

195
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:07,324
Survivors, ready?

196
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:08,571
Go !

197
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,225
Jeremy is moving.

198
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:14,076
Savage launches.

199
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:16,887
Jeremy has the ring,

200
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:18,380
Savage is right behind.

201
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:23,156
Jeremy scores before Savage,

202
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,286
and Savage,

203
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,422
less than half a second later!

204
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:29,867
That's crazy !

205
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:31,950
We don't get any tighter!

206
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:34,530
Bayon leads, 1 to nothing.

207
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:35,964
Next duel.

208
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:37,775
It will be Kass

209
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,586
against Fishbach.

210
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:41,445
Survivors, ready?

211
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:43,480
Go !

212
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:45,293
Come on, Stephen, come on!

213
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,285
Get up, Stephen, get up!

214
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,479
Come on, buddy, come on!
Faster !

215
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:53,640
Kass wastes no time,
she has her ring.

216
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:55,584
- Stephen has his.
- Come on, Stephen!

217
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:00,597
Kass almost scores.

218
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:01,773
Steve, you calm down!

219
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:03,725
Fishbach,
can he do it now?

220
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,235
Right on the post!

221
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,895
- Right on it!
- Relax !

222
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:10,206
Don't spin it!

223
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,311
Kass can equalize now.

224
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:14,912
And she does!

225
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:16,013
Equality!

226
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:17,406
1 - 1 !

227
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:19,788
I am sorry.

228
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,410
Have faith in yourself!

229
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:23,679
We trust you,
trust yourself!

230
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:25,096
Go on !

231
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,191
Next duel.

232
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:29,860
It's Abi for Ta Keo,

233
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:31,245
Kimmi for Bayon.

234
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,554
Survivors, ready?

235
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:35,986
Go !

236
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,331
It's too short
for both women.

237
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:46,143
Kimmi will try to walk.
It is not easy.

238
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,747
Kimmi has her ring, Abi has hers.

239
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:51,654
Kimmi lance.

240
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,627
Kimmi, it does not hold!

241
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,486
Do not ! Do not ! Do not !

242
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:57,524
Carry on!

243
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,114
Abi thought it was over!

244
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:01,849
Abi can give Ta Keo the advantage.

245
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:04,995
Ta Keo leads,

246
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:06,430
2 - 1 !

247
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:08,590
Next round.

248
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:10,708
- It'll be Woo...
- Yeah, Woo!

249
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,202
...against Joe.

250
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,096
Dress up well, Joe!

251
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:18,000
Joe needs to score
for Ta Keo to stay in the game.

252
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,343
Go-y, Big Joe!

253
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:20,878
Survivors, ready?

254
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,973
Go !

255
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,075
Woo se lance.

256
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,920
Joe launches.

257
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:31,028
The two quickly reach the ring.

258
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:33,257
Woo... No!
And it's done!

259
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:34,683
Bayon scores!

260
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:37,728
Equality!
We go to sudden death!

261
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,312
This is the showdown!

262
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:40,722
From the first shot!

263
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,831
Everything will be played there.

264
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,327
Wiglesworth

265
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,846
against Wentworth.

266
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:49,231
The one who marks

267
00:12:49,356 --> 00:12:50,841
win for his tribe

268
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,375
fried chicken, pasta gratin.

269
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,279
Let's go. For victory.

270
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:56,705
Survivors, ready?

271
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,765
Go !

272
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:02,586
Wentworth se lance.

273
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:03,854
It's too short.

274
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,384
The two women are standing.

275
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:08,898
The first ring
wins for its tribe.

276
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:12,281
Almost, do it again!

277
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:15,424
- Go ahead !
- Its good.

278
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,259
Wentworth, for the win.

279
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:21,263
No, it doesn't!

280
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:23,557
Wiglesworth can win.

281
00:13:23,682 --> 00:13:24,690
And There you go !

282
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:28,112
Wiglesworth wins for Ta Keo!

283
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:29,972
Huge reward!

284
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:38,122
Ta Keo, big reward.

285
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:41,458
A Survivor-style picnic
delivered to your camp.

286
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,761
You don't have to do anything but
enjoy it.

287
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:45,360
Take your things, leave.

288
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:47,923
- Enjoy the afternoon.
- Thank you, Jeff!

289
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:52,158
Bayon, I have nothing for you.
Take your things, return to camp.

290
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:56,440
Considering the makeup of my tribe,
I couldn't be happier.

291
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:57,773
I have Abi and Woo.

292
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,481
After what we went through at Angkor,
we are inseparable.

293
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:04,462
If I could just reunite
old Bayon, Kass and Ciera,

294
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:06,942
that would be the perfect equation.

295
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,044
I'm not about to leave.

296
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:28,713
Oh my God !

297
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:33,674
These brownies
are bigger than a fist!

298
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,390
Well done, everyone!

299
00:14:35,515 --> 00:14:36,976
It was amazing!

300
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:40,080
Coming to this new
Ta Keo tribe, I thought...

301
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:41,972
to the great meal I was going to make,

302
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:44,109
but I had in the back of my mind

303
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,677
a stubborn thought:

304
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,555
how the hell
am I going to get by in this tribe?

305
00:14:49,214 --> 00:14:50,658
How was Ta Keo,

306
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:53,394
the last days ?

307
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,193
We were relaxed because...

308
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:58,631
I know you don't believe it,
but the four of us who stayed

309
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:01,347
we were the calmest,
the least conspiratorial.

310
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:02,561
I can believe it.

311
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,573
When Kass and I had to do

312
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,967
what seemed impossible
and interact,

313
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,397
it was a little weird.

314
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:11,545
We were suspicious.

315
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,307
Can I have a piece of watermelon?

316
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:14,673
You can have ten.

317
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,801
I really didn't know
how to act.

318
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,521
So I tried
to treat her like the others.

319
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:22,915
But it never worked
in the past with Kass.

320
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,850
Do you realize we're here?

321
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,032
We got out of this hell!

322
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,597
No, you have no idea
how hard that was!

323
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:32,355
What we experienced in Angkor
was so traumatic

324
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,201
that having this victory,
this food,

325
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:37,727
was one of the best times
of my life. Honestly.

326
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:39,206
It seems silly...

327
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:40,899
A magnificent moment.

328
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,644
- Health !
- Your Keo! Health !

329
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,003
- Cheer !
- Health !

330
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:46,873
As soon as I looked at the other six,

331
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:49,074
I thought,
"I have five people."

332
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,377
Two former Bayon, Kass and Ciera,

333
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:52,705
and my Angkors.

334
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,521
How long have you been in Chicago?

335
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:57,157
Spencer is a great kid.

336
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:59,785
If I had a son,
I would like him to be like him.

337
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,729
Big heart, super brave.

338
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:03,155
I love this kid.

339
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,656
But I'll tell you,
and it's going to sound brutal.

340
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,601
I know that deep down,

341
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,837
Kass can't stand Spencer.

342
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:13,073
And I'm going to use it
to my advantage.

343
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:20,314
Tell me, if we lose immunity,
what do you want to do?

344
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,169
- What do you think ?
- I do not know.

345
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:23,911
Ciera and I are solid.

346
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:26,645
Abi, Woo and I... Inseparable.

347
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,248
So we have three of us.
As you wish.

348
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:31,750
- Great.
- And I know what you want.

349
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,092
- Are you speaking on behalf of Bayon?
- Spencer has to go.

350
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:35,891
- Spencer has to go.
- Yeah.

351
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,823
I would love to fire Spencer again.

352
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:40,062
I didn't want him
in my tribe.

353
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:41,994
I wanted to play Second Chance

354
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,456
without the Bledsoe.

355
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,506
- That's it. We five.
- Good.

356
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:46,632
Parfait.

357
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,360
what we said to each other,

358
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:51,912
it's like you'd say to Spencer,
"Ciera is leaving."

359
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,061
It will be a total surprise.
He won't see it coming.

360
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:58,977
Savage says,
"We're gonna fire Spencer and tell him..."

361
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,521
It's me who's leaving.

362
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:05,659
Me ? Uh, wait a bit!

363
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:09,061
It shows
who he trusts

364
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:11,757
that he'd rather expose me
than Woo.

365
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:13,759
Woo is not an original Bayon.

366
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,756
- You're not leaving.
- I believe in you.

367
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:19,814
- It's for the surprise.
- No shenanigans. Everything is fine.

368
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,611
When your name is mentioned,
it's never good.

369
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:27,416
I am ready to do
a lot of things for the team.

370
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,074
It's not part of it.

371
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,218
One, two, three, Ta Keo!

372
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:36,999
Voilà.

373
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:40,285
- Don't let him down!
- Of course not !

374
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,958
Don't set it on fire, either!

375
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,499
Oh, no one...! He is...

376
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:47,635
Oh, good! Good boy !

377
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,763
Kimmi ...

378
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,376
- How did he fall?
- Thin !

379
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:57,703
- Oh, my God, Joe!
- I say.

380
00:17:58,187 --> 00:17:59,872
You have your work cut out for you,

381
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,201
because you are a Ta Keo.

382
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:03,375
I say. I knew I
would be in trouble here.

383
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,220
- You're the easy vote.
- I say.

384
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:08,514
- I say.
- We have to figure out how to save you.

385
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,124
After the mixing of tribes,

386
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:11,984
strategically, I am well placed.

387
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:15,763
I have an original covenant from Bayon,

388
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:20,067
and on the Ta Keo camp,
myself, Kass, Ciera,

389
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:22,772
Kelley and Keith,
we made a deal.

390
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:24,888
So I wanna keep Kelley
around,

391
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:27,057
to have a majority in the merger.

392
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:29,273
You're stronger than Stephen and Kimmi.

393
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:30,402
I say.

394
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,613
This is the main argument.

395
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:33,858
It's certain.

396
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:36,784
Of course, I'm the easy vote.
I realize that.

397
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,444
But I have an immunity idol,

398
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,939
and if Joe wants to protect me,

399
00:18:41,064 --> 00:18:43,624
I will hide behind him
as long as possible.

400
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:44,833
Thank you.

401
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,307
What do we do,
we stay the six together?

402
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,573
- What do you want... ?
- Fire Wentworth, okay?

403
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:52,903
I don't think we're losing, but...

404
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:56,199
Are we relying on strength?

405
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,406
I love Kimmi

406
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:01,734
but... on the tests...

407
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:04,903
I'm just saying...
For our first vote...

408
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,041
I say: "Bayon in force."
Why fuck this now?

409
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:12,378
The Bayon elders say,
"Let's stay between Bayon."

410
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,113
Joe says, "No.

411
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,948
Let's keep Wentworth and target Kimmi."

412
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,260
He's already trying to push
the core alliance

413
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:20,519
to tear each other apart.

414
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,563
Joe dit Kimmi.

415
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,757
- I do not like it.
- Of course not.

416
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:27,401
In fact, Joe betrayed
the Bayon alliance.

417
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:29,428
It's Survivor. We must react.

418
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:31,563
I don't trust him.

419
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,699
I would be happy to fire him.

420
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:35,689
Like, right away.

421
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:39,204
But I...
I don't want to start with Joe.

422
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,917
Stephen sticks to his guns,
he wants Joe out.

423
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:45,315
But I need a shield.

424
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,521
I need Joe
for as long as possible.

425
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,581
I don't want to be the biggest guy.

426
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:51,692
Good. We will discuss it.

427
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,255
At the reward event,
Jeremy said, "Be more confident,

428
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,490
believe in yourself!”
And you know what?

429
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,692
I give everything to win Survivor.

430
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:03,800
It doesn't
necessarily show up in the tests.

431
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:05,806
I know I'm no good at it.

432
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:07,056
You kidding.

433
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:08,988
You think-y. [???]

434
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:10,484
I have other strengths.

435
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,782
When it comes to strategic moves,

436
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:14,804
For me, that's the essence of the game.

437
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,730
The social strategy.

438
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:19,056
Building alliances, maintaining them,

439
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:21,051
target the right person
at the right time.

440
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,691
He's trying to take us out
to save Wentworth.

441
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:26,218
- He's not with the Bayons.
- OK.

442
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,713
It would be unexpected,
but in the long run...

443
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:31,290
You think it's a mistake,
that it's too soon.

444
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:32,417
Yeah.

445
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:35,042
If I can't drag
my allies into this shot,

446
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,537
I failed.

447
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:39,561
Rare are the opportunities
to eliminate its main competitors.

448
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:41,527
And... You know...

449
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,408
What annoys me, actually...

450
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:53,997
God, I can't
believe I'm crying!

451
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:56,123
It's the idea that...

452
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,881
That I could miss...

453
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:00,755
God, it's too stupid!

454
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:06,202
Missing that second chance,
missing my...

455
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:10,343
I invested myself so much,
the last time,

456
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,373
but I still failed.

457
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:15,332
And I'm investing so much
this time...

458
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:20,592
And the idea that I might fail,

459
00:21:21,017 --> 00:21:24,610
because I would not have been able to convince
my team to do the necessary...

460
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:27,582
I blame myself for so many years

461
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:30,151
not to have eliminated
the young prodigy, the last time.

462
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:33,128
But wait for the game
to come to you and let it slip away,

463
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:35,071
that would be a real failure,

464
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:37,623
not to take control
when you have the chance.

465
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:40,661
It would be such a nice shot.

466
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:41,994
Such a nice shot.

467
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:43,829
It would be THE blow

468
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:46,634
which would set
the tone for the whole season.

469
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:59,003
Over here, everyone!

470
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:11,286
Ready for
today's immunity test?

471
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,903
- Yes !
- Yes sir !

472
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:14,527
First of all, Ciera,

473
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:16,491
I take back the idol.

474
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,763
Merci.

475
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:24,453
Once again,
immunity is at stake.

476
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:27,677
Today you will take part
in a taste test.

477
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:32,409
You will have to swallow
Cambodian specialties as soon as possible.

478
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:35,176
Who finishes first
scores a point for their tribe.

479
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:37,479
The first to four points
wins immunity,

480
00:22:37,604 --> 00:22:38,785
is out of the vote.

481
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,226
The losers will go to the council,
where someone will be eliminated.

482
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:46,429
We did
this test 14 times.

483
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:50,200
Kelly, you were there originally.

484
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:53,450
Kimmi did it in season 2,
in Australia.

485
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:56,631
She didn't even try
to swallow the beef brain.

486
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,775
Savage took part,

487
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,536
just like Ciera,
who did not pass the 1st round.

488
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:03,004
Each tribe,

489
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:04,514
for the 1st round,

490
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,112
will line up two team members.

491
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:07,411
We will begin.

492
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:11,157
Here we go, round one.

493
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:12,846
Kimmi et Tasha

494
00:23:13,306 --> 00:23:15,191
against Woo and Spencer.

495
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:17,127
Go ahead, reveal.

496
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:20,687
Oh Kimmi.
Oh my God !

497
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:21,823
It's alive ?

498
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,333
It'll be OK.

499
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,636
Each has two tarantulas to swallow.

500
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:28,596
The first duo to finish
scores the point.

501
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:30,240
Let's go.

502
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:31,933
Survivors, ready? Go!

503
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,169
Show me an empty mouth!

504
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:36,713
- Okay!
- Good, Tasha!

505
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:38,682
There are some guts in there.

506
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:39,908
And a little juice.

507
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:42,518
Kimmi you mal.

508
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:46,089
Everyone has their tarantulas
in their mouths, except Kimmi.

509
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,517
It's good for Spencer. Step back.

510
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:51,294
Avale!

511
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:56,710
It's good for Woo!
Ta Keo scores the 1st point!

512
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:06,186
Jeremy and Keith
against Savage and Ciera.

513
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,895
Everyone, reveal.

514
00:24:09,604 --> 00:24:11,608
Giant water beetles.

515
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:15,076
There will be some tripe and juice.

516
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:17,004
Survivors, ready?

517
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,284
Go !

518
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:21,616
It's crispy and juicy.

519
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:23,788
Bravo, Keith ! Super, Jeremy !

520
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:25,752
Jeremy is on 2nd.

521
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:28,223
Savage is now on 2nd.

522
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,602
It's good for Savage and Jeremy.

523
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:33,980
Come on, Keith!

524
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,707
It's now between Ciera
and Keith, for the point.

525
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:40,135
It would be real redemption
for Ciera.

526
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:42,345
Come on, Ciera, it's good!

527
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:46,775
It's good for Keith!

528
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,976
Equality,

529
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:49,544
1 - 1 !

530
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,652
Very nice effort.

531
00:24:57,781 --> 00:25:01,231
Fishbach and Wentworth
versus Kass and Abi.

532
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:02,891
Go ahead, reveal.

533
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:06,528
A pork groin.

534
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:09,339
Let's go. Survivors, ready?

535
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:10,471
Go !

536
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:14,727
From the outset, everyone bites
frankly into it.

537
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,005
Abi goes there with a good heart.

538
00:25:20,637 --> 00:25:22,888
- It's good, swallow!
- It's good, Abi!

539
00:25:24,012 --> 00:25:25,841
Do you see that! First to finish!

540
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:29,484
Abi a fini.

541
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:31,386
New Showdown:

542
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,096
Kass against Wentworth.

543
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:34,823
They are left with the same amount.

544
00:25:36,642 --> 00:25:38,481
Kass spits out a piece.

545
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:41,570
And it is successful!

546
00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:44,440
Bayon scores and leads,

547
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,468
2 - 1 !

548
00:25:46,593 --> 00:25:47,911
Good game !

549
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:50,338
We move on to individual face-to-face meetings.

550
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:53,250
Joe versus Wiglesworth.

551
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,415
Unveil.

552
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,280
A fried frog.

553
00:25:58,346 --> 00:25:59,769
You're going to rock, Joe!

554
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:00,982
Bayon lead 2 - 1.

555
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,717
Survivors, ready? Go!

556
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:04,340
Come on, Joe!

557
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,297
Kelly stuffs everything!

558
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:09,576
- Go ahead, Kelly!
- Take it easy, Joe, she's got too much.

559
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,735
Joe takes it one piece at a time.

560
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,533
Two very different strategies.

561
00:26:14,318 --> 00:26:16,835
Kelly could equalize now.

562
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,187
The tremble!

563
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:19,802
Il tremble, Kelly !

564
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:23,904
Kelly succeeds for Ta Keo!

565
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:25,649
She beats Joe!

566
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:29,251
Tied, 2 - 2.

567
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,017
Next round:

568
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:33,156
Woo, Kimmi.
Go ahead, reveal.

569
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:36,918
Pork brain.

570
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:42,065
I haven't eaten pork
in 30 years.

571
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:45,262
So, jumping straight
to the brains...

572
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:46,730
It's a bit extreme.

573
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,564
So I'm going to let Woo
eat some brains.

574
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:53,443
Let's go. Survivors, ready?

575
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,579
Go !

576
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:57,265
- [???]
- Bon appetit!

577
00:26:57,897 --> 00:26:58,907
Cheers !

578
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:00,041
Brain!

579
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:03,945
Sounds easy with Woo.

580
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,156
Not even five seconds!

581
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:08,683
Ta Keo leads,

582
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:10,327
3 - 2.

583
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:11,981
Next round.

584
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:13,663
Ciera, Wentworth.

585
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:14,823
Unveil.

586
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,065
Scorpion.

587
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,193
Ciera,

588
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:21,137
if you win,
you win the event for Ta Keo.

589
00:27:21,816 --> 00:27:23,873
If you lose,
there will be a tie, 3 - 3.

590
00:27:23,998 --> 00:27:25,767
Big pressure.
Survivors, ready?

591
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,053
Go !

592
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:28,852
Come on Ciera!

593
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:33,850
Ciera could win
for her tribe.

594
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:36,158
It would be an amazing
second chance story.

595
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:37,523
Avale, avale!

596
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:41,015
Wentworth can equalize for Bayon,
to play another round.

597
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,884
The losers go to the council,

598
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,286
where someone will be eliminated from the game.

599
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:51,872
Wentworth scores for Bayon!

600
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:55,430
Ciera fails once again.

601
00:27:55,994 --> 00:27:57,490
Tied, 3 - 3.

602
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,535
Ciera, why the tears?

603
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,774
I feel bad
for letting them down...

604
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:03,313
But no.

605
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:05,707
...but I'm proud
to have simply...

606
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:07,562
Once !

607
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:14,629
Kass versus Tasha.

608
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:16,059
Last dish.

609
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:17,327
Unveil.

610
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,615
Baluts.

611
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:22,223
Lord, this is violent.

612
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:23,908
Duck embryos.

613
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:25,693
Here we are, for the win.

614
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:29,039
The first to finish
sends the other tribe to the council.

615
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:31,575
Huge challenge.
Hands on the table until my signal.

616
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,337
Survivors, ready? Go!

617
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:35,779
Damn, yeah!

618
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:37,238
All at once!

619
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,041
Kass, don't vomit!

620
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,780
Don't look, turn around!

621
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:45,021
Kass is in trouble
with just a small piece.

622
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:47,849
And it goes up.
It's like the last time.

623
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:49,441
Everything is reassembled.

624
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:51,001
Go ahead, girl!

625
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:53,210
Ali's footwork now!

626
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,037
Tash succeeds for Bayon!

627
00:29:01,162 --> 00:29:03,031
Bayon wins immunity

628
00:29:03,483 --> 00:29:06,514
and sends Ta Keo to the council,

629
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:09,404
where someone will be eliminated from the game!

630
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:10,538
Bravo !

631
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:15,663
Kass, are tears
a physical reaction to tasting

632
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,400
Or an emotional reaction?

633
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:18,744
Both, I believe.

634
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:21,416
I felt like throwing up,
which made me cry a little.

635
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,445
And then, disappoint the tribe.

636
00:29:28,354 --> 00:29:29,357
Bayon,

637
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:31,487
immunity is yours.

638
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,895
- Well deserved.
- Well done, Tasha!

639
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:38,553
No advice for Bayon.

640
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:40,471
Take your things,
return to camp.

641
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:42,470
- Enjoy the evening.
- Count it!

642
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:44,939
Good job.

643
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:50,078
Wow, really?

644
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:52,026
I haven't eaten
for 16 days, Jeff!

645
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:56,676
Ta Keo, I only have one date for you
tonight at the council,

646
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:59,195
where someone will be eliminated from this game.

647
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,118
Take your things,
return to camp.

648
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:02,481
See you tonight at the council.

649
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,152
We have advice tonight.

650
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:06,263
I would love to eliminate Spencer
again.

651
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,696
If he was the first person
whose name I write,

652
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:10,219
I would be overjoyed.

653
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,672
Put a sad smiley on his box
and send him home.

654
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:16,913
Spencer Bledsoe, zero percent
chance of winning this game!

655
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:40,423
We lost the trial
and we have to face the council.

656
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:44,996
We already discussed who
we wanted to eliminate in such a case.

657
00:30:45,362 --> 00:30:46,840
So for now,

658
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:50,224
if everything goes as planned,
we all vote spencer.

659
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:57,809
Everyone knows the plan.

660
00:30:58,361 --> 00:30:59,444
It's locked.

661
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:01,281
Everyone has to say "Ciera".

662
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:04,458
So everyone says "Ciera".

663
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,184
But you don't have to worry.

664
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:07,315
Do not stress.

665
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,331
If he asks me,
I'll say I don't know.

666
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:14,854
- Don't let anyone see you talking to Ciera.
- OK.

667
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:24,745
Arriving here, in Ta Keo,
in the majority,

668
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,086
I finally feel
in harmony with the game,

669
00:31:27,211 --> 00:31:29,516
and I can play.

670
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:34,870
What do you think will happen
tonight?

671
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:37,254
For me, Ciera has to go.

672
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:40,927
I'm on the sidelines,
at least for now.

673
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:43,522
But I wanted to play with Savage
from the start.

674
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,967
I think he's a good guy
I can trust.

675
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,086
Woo knows, Kass knows,

676
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:52,430
Abi knows, I know,
and now you know.

677
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,578
It's incredibly hard for me
to lead him on like this.

678
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:58,036
This kid is great.

679
00:31:58,161 --> 00:32:00,747
But nothing will stand
in the way of my second chance.

680
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:03,248
So tonight,
everyone votes for Spencer.

681
00:32:04,017 --> 00:32:05,243
Ciera votes for him.

682
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:07,754
- OK ?
- Yeah.

683
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:09,840
This will be one
of the surprise eliminations

684
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:12,818
the most devastating and unexpected
in Survivor history.

685
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,004
I am not joking.

686
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:17,656
It's my 2nd chance.
I will not have a 3rd.

687
00:32:18,663 --> 00:32:19,991
Alright, here's the thing.

688
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:22,470
I don't like
that being my name.

689
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:25,629
Who does Savage think he is?

690
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:27,811
It was weird, he said,
"We'll say Ciera."

691
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:30,277
I said to myself: "Where does this come from?"

692
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:34,047
We're supposed to stay between Bayon,
and now there's Woo? It annoys me.

693
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:37,642
Terry
's departure triggered something in me.

694
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:40,974
This is my 2nd chance,
it could be my last.

695
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,797
And I want to go all out

696
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,593
to be able to say to my family:
"I gave it my all."

697
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:47,986
That's what I think.

698
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:50,697
I'd like to eliminate Spencer
before the merger.

699
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:52,791
It would be stupid to keep Woo

700
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:54,540
rather than Spencer.

701
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:58,572
Ciera wants to eliminate Woo.

702
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:01,550
I didn't want to play with Spencer.

703
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:04,262
I was happy not to be
in his tribe so far.

704
00:33:04,387 --> 00:33:06,913
And when everyone said,
"Let's take out Spencer first!",

705
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:08,940
it was almost
served to me on a platter.

706
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:11,209
But then you have to step back.

707
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:13,578
Because there is better to do with him
for the moment.

708
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,048
We should talk.

709
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:19,105
I don't want to rehash Cagayan...

710
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,232
Non.

711
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:23,091
...but it would be nice
to review everything.

712
00:33:23,216 --> 00:33:25,265
Yeah. Stuff happens.

713
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:28,515
And some might benefit you.

714
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,629
Because you seem out of place to me.

715
00:33:30,754 --> 00:33:32,498
I really like Savage.

716
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:35,000
So it's interesting.

717
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,274
Savage said,
"Why not aim for Spencer?

718
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:39,020
We'll tell him it's Ciera."

719
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:41,733
Savage is after me?

720
00:33:46,444 --> 00:33:47,896
When did he say that?

721
00:33:48,168 --> 00:33:50,754
Right after the feast.
We were in the shelter.

722
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:53,418
If Kass is telling the truth,

723
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:57,282
that Savage sees me
as a target,

724
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:00,826
it only remains for me to choose
where to flee.

725
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:03,926
I'm leaning towards
a surprise elimination of Woo...

726
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:06,250
Do we have a good group for that?

727
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,867
Ciera, Abi, me and you,
that's four.

728
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,641
I'm fooling around with the devil tonight.

729
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,839
I might have to play with Kass.

730
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:24,083
I will finally have my revenge
on Spencer Bledsoe.

731
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:28,353
Two ideas are circulating.

732
00:34:28,744 --> 00:34:30,430
Savage, Wiglesworth et Woo

733
00:34:30,555 --> 00:34:32,499
think Spencer is going to leave.

734
00:34:32,624 --> 00:34:34,426
Spencer, Abi and Ciera

735
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,169
think Woo is going to leave.

736
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:37,392
We agree ?

737
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:39,564
I will have no hesitation.

738
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:41,710
I have no interest
in doing anything else.

739
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:43,101
We are too strong like this.

740
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:45,512
I have the opportunity

741
00:34:45,637 --> 00:34:48,196
to write "Spencer"
and say goodbye to him.

742
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:51,331
At this moment,
it remains a possibility,

743
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,777
given the votes.

744
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:01,353
This is the first advice
of my second chance.

745
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:03,915
Which Kass will show up?

746
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,666
Calme-Kass or Chaos-Kass?

747
00:35:06,994 --> 00:35:10,065
The little angel and the devil
are both on my shoulders.

748
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:11,910
"Spencer !"
"Woo !"

749
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,043
"Calme !"
"Chaos !"

750
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:15,225
They are there !

751
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,369
What's going to happen ?
Even I don't know.

752
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:37,022
For those who haven't
come to the board yet,

753
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:40,035
grab a torch
and light it in the fire.

754
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:44,871
It is part
of the council ritual,

755
00:35:44,996 --> 00:35:46,984
because in this game,
fire represents your life.

756
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:49,176
If your fire goes away, so do you.

757
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:53,547
We are on the 16th day

758
00:35:53,797 --> 00:35:56,231
of this
Second Chance experience.

759
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:57,486
It's really this:

760
00:35:57,611 --> 00:36:00,587
a chance to see if you can
change the way you play

761
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:02,146
and improve your result.

762
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:04,478
Savage, what
have you been working on?

763
00:36:04,603 --> 00:36:05,717
My personal game.

764
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:08,954
Develop deep relationships

765
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:12,171
starts with identifying
reliable and loyal people.

766
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,485
I think I've done it well.

767
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,596
Spencer, what's
your second chance been around so far?

768
00:36:18,264 --> 00:36:20,349
Come in this game,

769
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:23,173
and see people
for what they are: people.

770
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:26,455
And it's difficult in a game
where you have to trick, dominate, last.

771
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,808
Absolutely. This is perhaps
the hardest context for this.

772
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:31,582
And, however, the most important.

773
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:32,711
Woo,

774
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:35,747
some would say
that what harmed you the 1st time,

775
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:39,359
is not having seen
that Tony was manipulating you

776
00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:41,503
for you to make
a million dollar mistake.

777
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:42,714
Yeah, absolutely.

778
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,890
In my 1st season, I failed

779
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:47,025
to understand that to succeed
in this game,

780
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,291
you have to know how
to be ruthless.

781
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,695
I'm at peace with that.

782
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,141
Kass, there's all these
2nd chance stories,

783
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:55,801
but you continue to play.

784
00:36:56,211 --> 00:36:57,878
How do you navigate

785
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:01,481
in so many
levels of relationships?

786
00:37:01,606 --> 00:37:03,185
Yes, it's hard to follow.

787
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,769
I was in Bayon,
at first, with Savage.

788
00:37:05,894 --> 00:37:08,422
Are we still welded between Bayon?

789
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:10,615
I know Woo from Cagayan.

790
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,603
Spencer, you know...

791
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:16,811
Ciera and I have been together
since day 1.

792
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:19,257
So who is close to whom,
and why?

793
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:20,701
This is very fun.

794
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:22,093
Is it Chaos-Kass

795
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,662
or the new Kass?

796
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:26,031
I don't know which Kass is here tonight.

797
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:29,876
Savage, this must be
a little disconcerting.

798
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:32,205
You never know
if Chaos-Kass is angry,

799
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,313
or if she's telling the truth,
or if she's about to take you out.

800
00:37:35,438 --> 00:37:38,109
I was with Kass for a long time
in the original Bayon.

801
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:40,403
I have to say
that I haven't seen Chaos-Kass yet.

802
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:43,215
I saw a kind and loyal Kass.

803
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,738
Ciera, what do you think
of all these relationships?

804
00:37:47,863 --> 00:37:49,154
How do you manage them?

805
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,024
Managing people
is one of my strengths.

806
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:55,271
I meet someone
and I follow my instincts.

807
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:59,364
I know Savage was with me,
but he bonded with Woo.

808
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,441
Everything flows

809
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:05,337
of the battle between your instincts,
your heart, and your brain.

810
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:06,738
Savage,

811
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:09,374
do you feel uncomfortable
when your name is mentioned,

812
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:12,551
whatever the sentence and the reason,
to the board?

813
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:13,678
Non.

814
00:38:13,803 --> 00:38:14,932
And why ?

815
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:17,088
Because I have no doubts
about tonight.

816
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,985
My judgment is my judgment.
If I screw up, it's my fault.

817
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:23,610
Ciera, when you hear that,
"I'm confident,"

818
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,506
this is where Survivor
gets fun.

819
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:28,560
If everyone
plays at the highest level,

820
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:31,183
everyone is confident.

821
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,166
And yet, someone is going to leave.

822
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:36,668
It's the scariest part of the board.

823
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:40,547
We all have a second chance,
and we all have our plans.

824
00:38:40,797 --> 00:38:43,263
And someone's plan
isn't going to work.

825
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,716
Spencer, it's all here.

826
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:46,920
Someone's plan
isn't going to work.

827
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:49,281
Yeah. Everyone is confident,
to varying degrees.

828
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:53,852
And that won't be the case
when you take out the extinguisher.

829
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:58,531
Good. It's time to vote.

830
00:38:58,656 --> 00:39:00,151
Wiglesworth, over.

831
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:15,173
I write your name
for one reason only.

832
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,483
You are too good at this game.

833
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:31,374
My fate tonight
is in the hands of Chaos-Kass.

834
00:39:34,168 --> 00:39:35,743
God help me!

835
00:39:47,072 --> 00:39:48,482
I will count the votes.

836
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:56,748
If anyone has an immunity idol
and wants to play it,

837
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:58,283
now is the time to do it.

838
00:40:04,164 --> 00:40:06,344
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

839
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:08,793
The eliminated person
will leave the council immediately.

840
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:10,428
I will read the votes.

841
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:14,866
First vote:

842
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:16,334
Spencer.

843
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:19,538
Woo.

844
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:25,043
Spencer.

845
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,589
Spencer.

846
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:31,349
Three Spencer votes, one Woo vote.

847
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:34,586
Woo.

848
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:35,962
Two votes Woo.

849
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,025
Wow. Equality.

850
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,869
Three votes Woo, three votes Spencer,

851
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:44,255
one vote remains.

852
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,147
Sixth person eliminated
from Survivor Second Chance...

853
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:52,579
Wow.
Bring me your torch.

854
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,042
Merci.

855
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,551
Surprise elimination!

856
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,298
Woo, the tribe has spoken.

857
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,552
It's time to go.

858
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,978
This season,

859
00:41:25,103 --> 00:41:27,038
the game is played at a very high level.

860
00:41:27,163 --> 00:41:29,641
In other words, you will have to continue

861
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:31,885
adapt your game

862
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,879
if you want to go all the way.

863
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:36,281
Take your torches,
return to camp. Good night.

864
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:44,498
It's a hard way
to quit the game,

865
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:46,124
but I had a blast.

866
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:49,456
This game is hardest,
mentally as well as physically,

867
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:52,839
so win or lose,
it's the fulfillment of a lifetime.

868
00:41:52,964 --> 00:41:55,588
And I'm thrilled
to be part of the Survivor family.

874

Next time in Survivor...

875
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:17,285
The merger is coming.

876
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,460
"Congratulations, you merged!"

877
00:42:19,585 --> 00:42:22,790
The game is launched. When we reach
fusion, things will change.

878
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,859
And Chaos-Kass is back.

879
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:26,828
The limit is drawn.

880
00:42:26,953 --> 00:42:29,931
Everyone thinks about their partners
and the manipulations to be put in place.

881
00:42:30,056 --> 00:42:32,934
Don't get in the way of my second chance!
You released the beast.

882
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:41,241
For ten years, I waited for
my 2nd chance in Survivor.

883
00:42:41,366 --> 00:42:43,772
But when Jeff woke me up
in the middle of the night,

884
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,737
going back to my family
was my only thought.

885
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:49,797
My son Danny needed
a heart transplant.

886
00:42:49,922 --> 00:42:52,381
And he got her, and he's fine.

887
00:42:52,506 --> 00:42:55,384
And to think that I thought I was the one
who had a second chance!

888
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,959
The survivor of the 2nd chance,
here it is!

889
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:01,630
Le don d'organes peut donner
une 2e chance dans la vie.
