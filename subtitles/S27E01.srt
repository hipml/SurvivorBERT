00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:44,886
>> THIS GAME IS ON!

189
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,387
>> WHAT DO WE DO?

190
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,305
WE SHOULD START.

191
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,014
IT'S GETTING DARK.

192
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,308
>> ARE WE GOING TO SLEEP ON THIS

193
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,017
BEACH WITH THESE CRABS.

194
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,769
>> WHAT WHY YOUR SUGGESTIONS.

195
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,145
>> I'M FOLLOWING YURL LEAD!

196
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:54,979
YOU'RE THE VETERAN.

197
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,230
>> THAT WAS 13 YEARS AGO.

198
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,356
>> IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE

199
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,441
DON'T SLEEP ON THE GROUND.

200
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,277
THERE ARE SO MANY ANTS.

201
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,652
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO DO

202
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,195
SOMETHING?

203
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:02,820
>> NO, YOU'RE GOOD.

204
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,614
>> Jeff: IT'S NOT EVEN DAY

205
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,824
ONE, BUT THE GAME HAS ALREADY

206
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:13,164
BEGUN.

207
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,791
>> OH, MY GOD.

208
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,625
>> Jeff: THEY HAVE LEFT BEHIND

209
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,502
THE COMFORT AND SAFETY OF THEIR

210
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,295
NORMAL WORLD TATAKE PART IN THE

211
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,631
ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME.

212
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,632
IT'S "SURVIVOR: BLOOD VS.

213
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,299
WATER."

214
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,760
20 AMERICANS FORCED TO WORK

215
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,636
TOGETHER TO BUILD A NEW SOCIETY

216
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,930
WHILE BATTLING THE ELEMENTS AND

217
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,140
EACH OTHER.

218
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,809
>> IT IS ONE OF THE MOST

219
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,560
IMPORTANT THINGS IN MY ENTIRE

220
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,979
LIFE TO BEAT HAYDEN MOSS.

221
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,439
>> Jeff: THEY MUST LEARN TO

222
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,358
ADAPT OR THEY WILL BE VOTED OUT.

223
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,025
>> SHE'S A THREAT TO ME.

224
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,485
AT SOME POINT IN TIME I WILL

225
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,611
HAVE TO GET RID OF HER.

226
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,946
>> Jeff: IN THE END, ONLY ONE

227
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,115
WILL REMAIN TO CLAIM THE

228
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:47,824
MILLION-DOLLAR PRIZE.

229
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,492
>> I WANT TO WIN THAT MONEY, I

230
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,618
WANT TO WIN THIS GAME, AND I'M

231
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,954
GOING TO BEAT ARAS TO DO IT.

232
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,997
>> Jeff: 39 DAYS, 20 PEOPLE,

233
00:06:55,081 --> 00:07:05,174
ONE SURVIVOR.

234
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:13,474
ONE SURVIVOR.

235
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,684
>> Jeff: GOOD MORNING.

236
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,144
>> GOOD MORNING!

237
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:29,574
>> GOOD MORNING!

238
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,493
>> Jeff: WELCOME TO THE

239
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,580
27th SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."

240
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:43,004
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

241
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,213
>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR

242
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,506
FIRST NIGHT.

243
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,050
HAYDEN, YOU PLAYED ANOTHER SHOW,

244
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:48,718
"BIG BROTHER," DID VERY WELL.

245
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,554
HOW DID YOUR FIRST MOMENTS ON

246
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,764
"SURVIVOR" COMPARE TO "BIG

247
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,473
BROTHER."

248
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,766
>> IT'S HARD TO COMPARE THE COZY

249
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,395
COFINES OF A HOUSE TO THAT LUSH

250
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,564
JUNGLE KAT AND I SLEPT IN LAST

251
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,273
NIGHT.

252
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,357
>> Jeff: THE GOOD NEWS SYOU'RE

253
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,609
GOING TO EXPERIENCE THIS GAME

254
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,568
WITH YOUR LOVED ONE.

255
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,237
BUT YOU WILL NOT BE PLAYING WITH

256
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:08,571
THEM.

257
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,238
THEM.

258
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,781
YOU WILL BE PLAYING AGAINST YOUR

259
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,532
LOVED ONE.

260
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,742
>> OH!

261
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,370
>> GEEZ!

262
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,079
>> Jeff: ANYBODY HERE WILLING

263
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,873
TO ADMIT THEY'RE LOOKING FORWARD

264
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,585
TO COMPETING AGAINST THEIR LOVED

265
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,044
ONE?

266
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:23,586
>> SORRY, MOM.

267
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,588
>> Jeff: WOW.

268
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,965
OVER HALF.

269
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,342
HAVE THEIR HANDS UP.

270
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,260
SO, KATIE, YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR

271
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,595
MOM ON IN A GAME SHE WON.

272
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,721
>> I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO

273
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,389
RAISE HER HAND, TOO.

274
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,683
I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST GOING TO

275
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,267
BE...

276
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,435
>> COMPETING IS GREAT.

277
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,270
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE

278
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,105
HARDEST THING ANY OF US DO IS TO

279
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,941
GET TO THAT POINT WHERE THE

280
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,609
TRIBES COME OUT AND YOU SEE YOUR

281
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,735
LOVED ONE MIGHT NOT BE THERE.

282
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,947
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SAD FOR

283
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,949
ANY OF OUR LOVED ONES TO GO

284
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:53,658
HOME.

285
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,909
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER, WHAT WOULD

286
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,953
THAT BE LIKE FOR YOU TO SEE

287
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,954
MONICA VOTED OUT?

288
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,413
>> I'M PULLED BOTH WAYS.

289
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,457
ON THE SURFACE I WANT TO BEAT

290
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,667
HER ON EVERY CHALLENGE WE DO.

291
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,961
BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET DEEP IN

292
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,504
MY HEART AND IF THERE'S A

293
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,672
CHALLENGE FOR A TARP AND IT'S

294
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,381
RAINING EVERY DAY AND WE'RE

295
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,632
GOING TO WIN AND SHE'S ON THE

296
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,758
OTHER TEAM, PART OF ME IS GOING

297
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,344
TO SAY, "GOD, I NEED HER TO HAVE

298
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,929
THE TARP INSTEAD OF ME.

299
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,806
I CAN DEAL WITH THIS STUFF."

300
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,807
>> YOU BETTER NOTOB MY TEAM

301
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,433
THINKING THAT.

302
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,352
YOU BETTER NOT BE ON MY TEAM

303
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:21,978
SAYING THAT.

304
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:22,979
>> ANSWERED WITH MY HEART

305
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,647
INSTEAD OF MY HEAD, AND ALL OF A

306
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,774
SUDDEN I GOT STARES AND LOOKS

307
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,858
FROM EVERY PERSON DOWN THE LINE.

308
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,652
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, OH, MY

309
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,403
GOSH.

310
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,028
FIRST FIVE SECONDS OF THE GAME,

311
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,864
WAY TO GO, BRAD.

312
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,992
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SAY YOUR

313
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:36,659
GOOD-BYES.

314
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,493
RETURNING PLAYERS OVER HERE.

315
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:44,709
NEW PLAYERS OVER THERE.

316
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,128
>> MY HEART SANK BECAUSE I KNOW

317
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,170
COLTON WAS REALLY HOPING TO HAVE

318
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,672
ME WITH HIM TO KIND OF BE THAT

319
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,090
PROVIDER THEY AM FOR HIM.

320
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,218
BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY A WAKE-UP

321
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:54,844
CALL.

322
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,137
>> LOVE YOU, HONEY.

323
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,307
>> YOU'RE NOT CRYING, RIGHT?

324
00:09:59,390 --> 00:09:59,974
>> IT WAS SAD.

325
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,144
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S A

326
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:03,811
GAME.

327
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,396
AND I CAN PLAY IT ON MY OWN,

328
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,022
TOO.

329
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,023
>> Jeff: YOU ARE NO LONGER

330
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,565
SIMPLY LOVED ONES.

331
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:13,863
YOU ARE NOW COMPETITORS.

332
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,533
>> VYTAS AND I HAVE SUCH A

333
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,200
COMPETITIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT

334
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,660
THERE'S NO WAY IF I LOSE A

335
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,703
CHALLENGE TO MY BROTHER OUT HERE

336
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,163
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO HEAR ABOUT

337
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,539
IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

338
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:24,832
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, HONEY.

339
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,542
>> WATCHING MY WIFE WALK OVER TO

340
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,668
THE OTHER TRIBE, IT WAS A LITTLE

341
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,004
BIT OF A RELIEF, AND A LITTLE

342
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,839
BIT OF SADNESS AT THE SAME TIME.

343
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,759
I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY AT ALL

344
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,677
ABOUT WRITING MY WIFE'S NAME

345
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,386
DOWN.

346
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,348
BUT THEN I ALSO CAN'T PROTECT

347
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,557
HER.

348
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,726
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

349
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,605
RETURNING PLAYERS, YOUR NAME IS

350
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,356
GALANG.

351
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,733
NEW PLAYERS, HERE'S YOUR BUFFS.

352
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:56,072
YOUR NAME IS TADHANA.

353
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:56,906
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S COMPLICATE

354
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,409
THE GAME A LITTLE MORE.

355
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:00,785
( SIGHS PRESENTLY

356
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,410
(.

357
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,454
>> Jeff: EACH TRIBE IS NOW

358
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,582
GOING TO VOTE SOMEONE OUT.

359
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:13,631
>> OH, MY GOSH.

360
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,091
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY TAKE A

361
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,760
PARCHMENT AND A PEN.

362
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:22,431
>> OH!

363
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,974
>> Jeff: HAYDEN, YOU LOOK

364
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,642
SHOCKED.

365
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,726
>> IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO BE

366
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,395
VOTING SOMEBODY OUT, I THINK.

367
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,104
FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE GOING TO

368
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:37,780
SPEAK VERY LOUDLY RIGHT HERE.

369
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,449
>> IN TRUE JEFF PROBST STYLE, HE

370
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,119
HAD TO REALLY TWIST THE KNIFE.

371
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,829
"OH, WE'RE GOING TO VOTE SOMEONE

372
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,454
OUT."

373
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:45,788

MARISSA CANNOT VOTE FOR HERSELF.

00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,877
THAT MEANS ONE MORE VOTE FOR

00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,129
LAURA AND YOU'RE OUT.

408
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,839

THAT'S IT.

411
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,841
YOU HAVE ENOUGH.

437
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,884
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

IT'S KILLING ME.

534
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,139
BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE MYSELF

535
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,892
IN THIS POSITION THAN I WOULD MY

IT, BUT WE WERE COUNTING ON

553
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,337

AND I WILL.

566
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,569
>> Jeff: JOHN, YOU HAVE THE

567
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,278
SAME OPPORTUNITY.

568
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,279
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND

569
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:10,988
TALK ABOUT IT?

570
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:16,285
>> YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

571
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,454
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

572
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,621
>> I DON'T KNOW.

573
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,791
I MEAN, IT'S UP TO YOU.

574
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,834
I THINK I CAN BEAT HIM.

575
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,294
>> YOU PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER

576
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,503
CHANCE THAN I DO.

577
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,963
>> Jeff: JOHN WHAT, DECISION

578
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,465
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE?

579
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,175
>> WELL, JEFF, MY WIFE SAY

580
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,217
REALLY TOUGH WOMAN, AND I HAVE

581
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:36,096
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT SHE CAN

582
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,805
WIN.

583
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,681
SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GIVE

584
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,308
HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT

585
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:39,975
RUPERT.

586
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:40,517
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, CANDICE

587
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,643
COME BACK.

588
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:47,983
JOHN, TAKE A SPOT IN THE TRIBE.

589
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,276
>> TOUGH CHOICE.

590
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,611
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, BIG MOVE

591
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,695
EARLY ON.

592
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,654
RUPERT'S PULLED HIMSELF OUT OF

593
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,365
THE GAME SO LAURA CAN HAVE A

594
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,158
SHOT.

595
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,701
CANDICE AND RUPERT, YOU WILL

596
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,244
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

597
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,788
YOU'LL COMPETE IN DUELS FOR A

598
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,706
SHOT TO GET BACK IN THIS GAME.

599
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,666
HEAD OUT.

600
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,336
>> LOVE YOU, HONEY.

601
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:12,841
>> LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY.

602
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:17,137
>> IN LAURA AND I'S WORLD, BLOOD

603
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,514
IS THICKER THAN ANYTHING.

604
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,890
AND LAURA AND I ARE BLOOD.

605
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:20,808
I'M MAKING IT BACK.

606
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,142
I'M MAKING IT BACK.

607
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,686
IF I CAN BATTLE MY ASS OFF

608
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,188
REDEMPTION ISLAND AND LAURA IS

609
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,356
STILL THERE, YOU BETTER WATCH

610
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,857
OUT, BECAUSE WE WILL BE ONE HELL

611
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,861
OF A TEAM.

612
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,363
>> Jeff: WATCHING CANDICE WALK

613
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,698
OFF LITERALLY FELT LIKE MY HEART

614
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,575
WAS BEING TORN OUT OF MY CHEST.

615
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,496
LIKE THE SECOND I-- THE SECOND I

616
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,375
SAW HER WALKING OFF, YOU KNOW, I

617
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,209
WAS LIKE THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S

618
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,879
GOING TO BE HARDER THAN NOT

619
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,547
DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO SAVE

620
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,966
MY WIFE'S BUTT IN THIS GAME.

621
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:54,675
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

622
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,468
YOU HAVE A LOT TO GET STARTED

623
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,135
WITH.

624
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:57,845
YOU'RE BUILDING A NEW WORLD.

625
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,472
EACH OF YOU HAVE A MAP TO YOUR

626
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,056
CAMPS.

627
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,224
HEAD OUT AND GET STARTED.

628
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:02,891
GOOD LUCK.

629
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,851
>> NOW I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

630
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,228
SHOW ALL THOSE DUMP ASSES HOW

631
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:15,279
BIG A MISTAKE THEY MADE.

632
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:23,245
BIG A MISTAKE THEY MADE.

633
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,414
>> GIVE ME A HUG.

634
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,415
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.

635
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,124
WAY TO GO.

636
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,709
>> IT'S AN HONOR TO PLAY WITH

637
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,418
YOU GUYS.

638
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,754
>> LET'S DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO

639
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,505
DO.

640
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,298
LET'S NOT SHE JEFF AT IMMUNITY.

641
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:38,093
>> I'D MUCH RATHER SEE TYSON RUN

642
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,595
AROUND NAKED.

643
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,305
>> LET'S POP OFF OUR SHIRTS.

644
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,639
>> ALL RIGHTY, THEN.

645
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,432
>> DO IT!

646
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,934
>> IT'S BEEN 13 YEARS SINCE

647
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,602
PLAYED "SURVIVOR."

648
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,436
I THINK IN THE THE LONGEST

649
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,772
LAYOFF ANYBODY HAS HAD PLAYING

650
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,440
THE GAME.

651
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,274
IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING, TO

652
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:52,983
SAY THE LEAST.

653
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,235
I KNOW I'M UP FOR IT, THOUGH.

654
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:55,944
>> MACHETE.

655
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,653
>> I WAS EXCITED TO SEE WE HAD A

656
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,655
BOX THERE WITH SOME SUPPLIES IN

657
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,406
IT.

658
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,616
>> IS THERE ANY FLINT?

659
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,491
>> NO.

660
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,120
>> HEY, ON "HEROES-VILLAINS" I

661
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:08,206
WATCHED AND HELP ROB START FIRE

662
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:08,832
WITH BAMBOO.

663
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,250
WE CAN DO IT.

664
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,169
WE JUST NEED ENOUGH PEOPLE.

665
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,587
>> I THINK GALANG IS A STRONG

666
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,630
DESCRIBE IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE A

667
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,632
LOT OF RETURNING PLAYERS, BUT

668
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,591
LAURA IS NOT GALANG.

669
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,801
SHE IS NOW, BUT SHE DIDN'T START

670
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,510
OFF THAT WAY.

671
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,137
I WANTED TO PLAY WITH RUPERT.

672
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,931
I DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY WITH

673
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,640
LAURA.

674
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,516
IF HER ASS GOT TO GO, GOOD-BYE.

675
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:26,975
PEACE!

676
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,977
SEE YOU LATER.

677
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:29,811
>> DAMN.

678
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:35,317
OKAY.

679
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,736
>> JOINING THE RETURNING

680
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,488
PLAYERS' TRIBE IS VERY

681
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,072
INTIMIDATING.

682
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,533
ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE THE

683
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,201
EXPERTS.

684
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,869
>> MOVE YOUR HAND OUT OF THE

685
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:46,578
WAY.

686
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,704
BUT TRY TO GET THE END OF IT.

687
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,372
>> OKAY.

688
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:48,997
>> YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU?

689
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,332
>> IT'S HER FIRST TIME.

690
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,500
>> IT'S HER FIRST TIME.

691
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,334
>> YOU NEED TO PRACTICE.

692
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,670
>> SO I'VE GOT A LOT OF PRESSURE

693
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,379
ON MY BACK.

694
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,047
I HAVE TO SHOW HOW TOUGH I AM

695
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,548
AND HOW VALUABLE I AM TO THE

696
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,257
TRIBE.

697
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,343
>> I SO WISH YOUR HUSBAND WAS

698
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:01,885
HERE RIGHT NOW, LAURA.

699
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,804
>> I KNOW I'M A LITTLE

700
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,680
DISAPPOINTING TO YOU GUYS.

701
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,514
>> NO, YOU'RE GREAT, YOU'RE

702
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,850
GREAT EYE DON'T MEAN TO BELITTLE

703
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,476
YOU.

704
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,060
I'M STOKED TO HAVE YOU.

705
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,853
>> YEAH, YEAH, THANK YOU.

706
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,854
I THINK THERE IS THE EXPECTATION

707
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,733
THEY AM LIKE RUPERT, BUT I'M NO

708
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,401
NOT.

709
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:17,734
WE SHOULD PROBABLY START THE

710
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,151
SHELTER.

711
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:18,819
>> LET'S GO.

712
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:28,912
>> WHOA!

713
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:35,919
>> THREE, TWO, ONE!

714
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,379
>> WHOOO!

715
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,547
>> YAY!

716
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,924
>> GO GET SOME STICKS.

717
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,217
>> BEING AN EXPERIENCED PLAYER

718
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,551
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO

719
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,386
HAVE FIRE.

720
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,263
DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR SHELTER.

721
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,389
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE

722
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,974
BECAUSE UNLESS YOU HAVE FIRE, WE

723
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:49,683
ARE DEAD IN THE WATER.

724
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,559
WITHIN 15 MINUTES, TYSON WENT

725
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,228
OUT THERE AND STARTED A FIRE.

726
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,730
>> ONCE WE GET THE FIRE HOT

727
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,231
ENOUGH, ANYTHING WILL BURN THAT

728
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,065
WE PUT IN IT.

729
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,400
>> IT'S BEEN NONSTOP.

730
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,818
WE'RE BOILING OUR WATER.

731
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,402
OUR CANTEENS ARE FULL.

732
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,778
>> WE'VE GOT WATER, GUYS.

733
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,446
>> WE'RE EATING OUR RICE.

734
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,406
MORAL IS GOOD.

735
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,407
IT'S AMAZING.

736
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,908
WE'RE REALLY COMFORTABLE AT THIS

737
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,036
POINT.

738
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,122
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS, WHAT

739
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:18,420
I AM SUPPOSED TO DO, BUT... MY

740
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,713
NANNY NEVER LET ME PLAY WITH

741
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,215
SHARP TOOLS.

742
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,053
TOOLS.

743
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,430
>> GETTING TO PLAY "SURVIVOR"

744
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,600
NOT ONCE BUT TWICE AND BOTH

745
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,310
TIMES COLTON IS OUT HERE.

746
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,395
HE WAS SEEN AS ONE OF THE MOST

747
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,063
VINDICTIVE, VILLAINOUS, MEAN

748
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,689
PEOPLE TO EVER PLAY-OFF THE

00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,273
GAME.

750
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,816
WE'RE ON THE SAME TRIBE.

751
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,902
WE DON'T NEED ANY DRAMA.

752
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,320
WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING TO HAPPEN

753
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,738
HERE, AND YOU HURT ME TO DEATH

754
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,448
LAST TIME.

755
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,824
A LOT AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN

756
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,993
BURY THAT AND NOT BE A NUISANCE

757
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:50,619
HERE AND MOVE ON.

758
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,330
I PLAYED WITH HIM BEFORE.

759
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,998
HE STABBED ME IN THE BACK.

760
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,960
AND I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE IT
HAPPEN

761
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,504
TO ME WHAT HAPPENED TO ME

762
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:00,962
BEFORE.

763
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:01,630
I CAN TRUST YOU?

764
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,298
OR ARE YOU GOING TO STAB ME IN

765
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,007
THE BACK AGAIN?

766
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,634
>> I THINK WE NEED TO TALK MORE

767
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,637
LATER, BUT, YES.

768
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,308
>> BUCK KNUCKLES.

769
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,601
>> HAS HE CHANGED?

770
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,310
HAS HE NOT?

771
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,313
I DON'T KNOW DOES A ZEBRA CHANGE

772
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:18,855
HIS STRIPES.

773
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,731
>> I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

774
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,817
>> I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE, TOO.

775
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,984
WE'LL GET PASSED IT.

776
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,656
AM I ONCE AGAIN GOING TO BE

777
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,115
BAMBOOZLED?

778
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:38,291
I DON'T KNOW.

779
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:47,134
I DON'T KNOW.

780
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:51,847
>> I HAVE RELIVED MONICA'S

781
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,973
"SURVIVOR: ONE WORLD"

782
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,517
EXPERIENCE WITH HER, AND THEN

783
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,184
YOU'RE DROPPED OFF ON A BEACH

784
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,853
AND, WHOA, THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

785
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:58,520
WE'RE ON.

786
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,313
THERE WERE SOME BUTTERFLIES.

787
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,356
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

788
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,984
THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO START.

789
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,027
>> I HAVEN'T SAWED SOMETHING

790
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:06,695
SINCE I WAS LIKE A KID.

791
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,823
BEING A YOGA TEACHER, THESE

792
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,699
HANDS DON'T SEE A HARD DAY'S

793
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,366
WORK.

794
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,784
>> SO WE'RE ALL WORKING HARD

795
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,493
AROUND CAMP.

796
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,246
THE BOYS ARE MAKING THE SHELTER.

797
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,206
THE GIRLS ARE WEAVING THE PALM

798
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:18,874
FRONDS.

799
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,541
WE HAVE NO VETERANS HERE SO

800
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,710
WE'RE ALL GOING ON WHAT OUR

801
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,879
LOVED ONES TOLD US AND BASICALLY

802
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,463
IT'S A BIT SHOCKING.

803
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,590
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

804
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,883
>> THAT'S OKAY, THOUGH.

805
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,593
>> I FEEL LIKE I COULD BE IN

806
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,260
TROUBLE.

807
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,220
FIVE MINUTES INTO THE GAME I

808
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,847
MADE A HUGE BLUNDER ABOUT NOT

809
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,724
GOING 100% TO POTENTIALLY HELP

810
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,893
MY WIFE BECAUSE NOW SHE'S THE

811
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,853
ENEMY I NEED TO PUT SOMETHING TO

812
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,520
REST REALLY QUICK.

813
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,605
IN THE FIRST MOMENTS OF THE

814
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,773
GAME, I MENTIONED SOMETHING

815
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,193
ABOUT-- HERE'S THE DEAL.

816
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,069
I PROMISE YOU, IN A CHALLENGE,

817
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,405
YOU DON'T SEE ME GOING 100 PYOU

818
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,823
GOT MY BLESSING TO VOTE ME OUT.

819
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,574
I PROMISE YOU.

820
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,912
I'M GOING 100% FOR TADHANA OVER

821
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,621
GALANG.

822
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,747
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO RIDE YOU

823
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,706
BACK TO THE FINISH.

824
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,082
>> HE SAID HE'S NOT GOING TO

825
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,751
THROW A CHALLENGE FOR HIS WIFE.

826
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,213
BUT IT WASN'T AN APOLOGY?

827
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:06,922
EXACTLY.

828
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:07,756
I FEEL LIKE HE'S ONE I'M GOING

829
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,633
TO DEFINITELY HAVE TO KEEP MY

830
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,051
EYE ON AND KEEP HIM CLOSE

831
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:11,760
BECAUSE HE SEEMS LIKE HE COULD

832
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,013
BE A LOOSE CANNON.

833
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:22,312
>> WHERE ARE THE GUYS?

834
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,773
>> THIS IS NICE, BUDDY.

835
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,609
>> OH, MAN.

836
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,902
WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR."

837
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,236
>> THIS IS AWESOME.

838
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,946
>> MAN.

839
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,489
IF THERE'S ONE THING LEARNED

840
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,240
FROM MONICA.

841
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,741
SHE SAID, "BRAD, LOOK, WHEN YOU

842
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,326
PLAY THIS GAME, YOU BETTER HIT

843
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,077
THE GROUND RUNNING."

844
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,912
>> THIS IS KIND OF A NICE FIND.

845
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,455
>> YOU HIT THE GROUND RUNNING

846
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,164
TALKING TO PEOPLE.

847
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:41,873
YOU NEED TO MAKE CONNECTIONS.

848
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,751
YOU NEED GET AN ALLIANCE FAST.

849
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,586
>> WELL, THE KEY IS WE'VE GOT

850
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,921
FIVE GUYS RIGHT NOW.

851
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:48,797
WE'VE GOT FOUR GUYS AND A GAY

852
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,256
GUY.

853
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:49,714
WE'RE STRONG.

854
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,423
I'M TELLING YOU--

855
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,133
>> I THINK WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

856
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,594
>> YEENG WELGO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

857
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,845
VERY FAST, ANYWAY.

858
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,473
>> THE IDEA TO KEEP ALL THE FIVE

859
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,474
GUYS TOGETHER STEMMED FROM BRAD.

860
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,309
>> YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO LOVE

861
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,102
THE WATERFALL.

862
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:02,811
>> REALLY?

863
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,480
>> IT'S NOT A SURPRISE AT ALL.

864
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,189
SHOCKER.

865
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:06,898
THE GUY WHO PLAYED NFL FOOTBALL

866
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,733
WANTS TO KEEP HIS LOCKER ROOM

867
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,442
TOGETHER.

868
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,153
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE MORE HE TALKS

869
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,530
ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF AND

870
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,614
ASSERTS HIMSELF A LEADER THE

871
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,658
MORE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY END

872
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,493
UP BITING HIM IN THE ASS LATER.

873
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,328
>> I'M THINKING WE GOT THE

874
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,330
NUMBERS WITH FIVE GUYS.

875
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,665
FIVE GUYS TOGETHER, THAT'S--

876
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,082
GOLD.

877
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,668
>> HOME RUN.

878
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,503
HERE'S THE DEAL.

879
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,087
THERE'S A FIVE-MAN ALLIANCE.

880
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,672
>> I THINK IT'S GENIUS.

881
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,465
>> I'M WILLING TO MAKE YOU

882
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,174
NUMBER ONE.

883
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,677
>> WHEN BRAD GOT ME BY MYSELF HE

884
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,305
WAS PRETTY MUCH TRYING TO

885
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,016
BULDY-BUDDY THE BROINANCE-TYPE

886
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,809
THING, ALL GUYS TO THE END, AND

887
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,185
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

888
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,228
LET'S SOUTHERN SHAKE ON IT.

889
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,355
A SOUTHERN MAN IS ONLY AS GOOD

890
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:47,814
AS HIS WORD.

891
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:48,523
>> WE'RE GOOD.

892
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,025
AND I'M THINKING YOU'RE WANTING

893
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,192
TO GET YOURSELF AND THEN YOUR

894
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,819
WIFE TO THE END AND WHOEVER

895
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:53,403
SHE'S WITH.

896
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,696
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT STUPID.

897
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,155
>> LET'S DO IT.

898
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,365
>> SOUNDS GOOD.

899
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,034
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

900
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,702
I'LL AGREE TO ANYTHING WITH HIM

901
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,870
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT WILL

902
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,996
SHUT HIM UP.

903
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,248
>> IF WE DO THE ALL FIVE GUY

904
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,708
THING WE CAN DWINLD THE GIRLS.

905
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,543
>> IT'S SO MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL

906
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,754
TO KEEP THE STRONG AROUND.

907
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,340
>> THESE DAYS, THE JOHN COCHRANS

908
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,050
OF "SURVIVOR" ARE THE BIG

909
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:15,759
THREATS NOW.

910
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,720
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WIN.

911
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,890
THE WEAKER WOMEN, JOHN COCHRAN.

912
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:22,891
I THINK JOHN IS ON BOARD WITH

913
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:23,850
ALL FIVE.

914
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,309
EVERYBODY IS.

915
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,436
>> I GOT CALEB.

916
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:26,895
I GOT JOHN.

917
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:33,068
I GOT HAIND.

918
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,569
FIVE.

919
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,738
FOUR WITH NINE EQUALS OUT.

920
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,908
BUT I'M SORRY-- YEAH, NO.

921
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:44,788
-- OKAY.

922
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:49,751
FOUR WITH NINE EQUALS OUT.

923
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:56,758
BUT FIVE WITH NINE EQUALS IN.

924
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,093
>> IT'S ALMOST LIKE TOO EASY.

925
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:12,607
>> TOO EASY.

926
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,233
>> THE SHELTER'S COMING TOGETHER

927
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:13,942
MAN.

928
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:14,818
>> LET'S GET THIS OVER TO THE

929
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,862
OTHER SIDE.

930
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:22,492
>> WE CAN SLIDE THIS ON THE

931
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:34,796
BOTTOM.

932
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,257
>> THERE'S NO FLINT, AND NONE OF

933
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,967
US KNOW HOW TO START A FIRE

934
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,928
WITHOUT FLINT.

935
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,638
AND WE CAN'T BOIL OUR WATER.

936
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,889
JUST BUILDING THE SHELTER,

937
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,641
PUTTING IT TOGETHER, I CAN FEEL

938
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,309
THE LIQUID LEAVING MY BODY AND

939
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:53,731
I'M TURNING INTO SLUDGE.

940
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,525
>> HOW LONG YOU AND YOUR MAN

941
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,192
BEEN TOGETHER.

942
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:56,985
>> WE'VE BEEN MARRIED THREE

943
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,903
YEARS, BEEN TOGETHER THREE AND A

944
00:28:58,987 --> 00:28:59,487
HALF, FOUR.

945
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,822
GOT MARRIED PRETTY QUICK.

946
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,698
>> SURE DID.

947
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,324
>> IS HE YUCK, TOO.

948
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:03,992
>> YEAH.

949
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,868
>> HE'S THE BABY DADDY OF BOTH

950
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,494
OF THEM?

951
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,871
>> JUST MY SECOND ONE.

952
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,332
WHEN I GOT PREGNANT IN HOLLY, 16

953
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,333
AND PREGNANT TYPE STORY.

954
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,835
>> GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T GET

955
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:14,461
MARRIED.

956
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,211
>> DUDE, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

957
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,755
I ACTUALLY WAS A TEEN MOM SO I

958
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,007
GOT PREGNANT WHEN I WAS 17 IN

959
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,674
HOLLY.

960
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,469
THAT WAS A HUGE GAME CHANGER FOR

961
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,220
ME, AND MY MOM, IT WAS A REALLY

962
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,972
HARD OBSTACLE FOR US TO GET

963
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:26,681
THROUGH.

964
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,183
EXWARGS FOR MY MOM, PROBABLY.

965
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,852
>> AS A PARENT, THAT WOULD BE SO

966
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,353
HARD BECAUSE YOUR KIDS ARE

967
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,229
EVERYTHING.

968
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,522
YOU KNOW?

969
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:34,898
I'M SURE IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR

970
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:35,607
YOUR MOM.

971
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,151
BUT IF MY DAUGHTER CAME HOME AND

972
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,694
SHE WAS 16 AND PREGNANT, I'D

973
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,155
EMBRACE HER AND SAY, "BABE, IT'S

974
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:42,697
OKAY.

975
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,239
LET'S DEAL WITH IT."

976
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,867
>> I DIDN'T TELL MY MOM.

977
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,368
>> REALLY.

978
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,079
>> THEY FOUND OUT EVENTUALLY.

979
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,789
WHEN YOUR PARENTS ARE CRYING,

980
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,041
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THE WORST

981
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:53,875
PERSON EVER.

982
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,168
NOW IT'S GREAT.

983
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,212
AND MY HUSBAND IS GREAT.

984
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,422
>> YOUR MOM PROBABLY THINKS

985
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,590
BEING A GRANDPARENT OF TWO IS

986
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,591
BETTER THAN A GRANDPARENT OF

987
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,342
ONE.

988
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,052
>> I WAS IN JAIL WITH A GUY WHO

989
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:08,723
WAS ONE OF THE TOP-10 DEADBEAT

990
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:09,265
DAD.

991
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:09,849
>> YOU WERE IN JAIL.

992
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,893
>> I WAS A JUNKY, MAN.

993
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,062
I WAS A HEROINE ADDICT WHEN I

994
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,939
WAS A TEENAGER.

995
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,524
MY BROTHER WAS THE GOLDEN CHILD,

996
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,900
AND GOT A SCHOLARSHIP TO COLLEGE

997
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,985
PLAYING BASKETBALL, STRAIGHT-A

998
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,029
STUDENT EXPIRVETION JUST LIKE--

999
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:23,613
YOU KNOW.

1000
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:23,947
>> OPPOSITE?

1001
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,198
>> OMS.

1002
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,032
DROPS OUT OF COLLEGE.

1003
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,116
LIVING ON THE STREET, ROBBING

1004
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,202
PEOPLE EVERY DAY TO GET MY FIX.

1005
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,871
MY ADDICTION IMPACTED MY FAMILY

1006
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,539
PROFOUNDLY.

1007
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,248
EVEN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY

1008
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,165
BROTHER TO THIS DAY IS STILL,

1009
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,125
LIKE, NOT FULLY MENDED.

1010
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,169
SO THIS IS A GREAT EXPERIENCE

1011
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,963
I'M GOING TO GET TO HAVE WITH MY

1012
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:40,630
BROTHER.

1013
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,631
THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING ON

1014
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,799
THIS TOGETHER IS A PRETTY GREAT

1015
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,926
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MEND SOME

1016
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:45,593
MORE.

1017
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,386
FINALLY GOT ARRESTED MAN PROBING

1018
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,095
SOME LADY.

1019
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:47,428
>> BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED

1020
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,096
TO YOU?

1021
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,138
>> BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO

1022
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:49,597
ME.

1023
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,099
SAVED MY LIFE.

1024
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,184
I OVERDOSED A FEW TIMES IN THE

1025
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:53,893
PAST MONTH.

1026
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,936
THE COPS FOUND ME ONE NIGHT IN

1027
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,647
THE BATHROOM OF A GAS STATION

1028
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,817
WITH A NEED IN MY ARM IT WAS TOO

1029
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,484
POWERFUL.

1030
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,111
>> AND YOU WERE JUST A BABY.

1031
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:03,945
>> YEAH, A CHILD.

1032
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,614
I THINK IN A GAME WHERE TRUST IS

1033
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,782
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.

1034
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:08,950
I WANTED TO SHARE WITH MY TRIBE

1035
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,119
MY PAST BECAUSE IF YOU WANT

1036
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,161
SOMEBODY TO TRUST YOU, YOU HAVE

1037
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,871
TO LET THEM IN LAILT BIT.

1038
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,331
I WANT TO BE VULNERABLE AND SHOW

1039
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,040
THEM.

1040
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,417
THAT PART OF MY PAST MAKES ME

1041
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,084
STRONGER.

1042
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,462
>> OH, IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

1043
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,298
THAT WAS A GREAT JOB, THOUGH,

1044
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,591
MAN.

1045
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,802
>> MAYBE LIGHTNING WILL STRIKE

1046
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:30,346
SOMETHING.

1047
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,139
>> FOR ME, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE

1048
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,140
THAT HEAR ABOUT THAT PART MIGHT

1049
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,475
HAVE PAST ARE GOING TO THINK

1050
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,476
ANYTHING LESS OF ME.

1051
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,144
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING

1052
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,355
TO SEE AN EX-CON THAT'S

1053
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,607
CONNIVING AND A DOPE FIEND THAT

1054
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,816
WILL DO WHATEVER HE CAN TO GET

1055
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:42,483
WHAT HE WANTS.

1056
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,818
I'VE GOT 14 YEARS CLEAN AND I

1057
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,861
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AWAY

1058
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,612
FROM THAT.

1059
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,155
AND I DO WANT TO SHOW THEM THAT

1060
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,406
THERE'S A DIFFERENT PART OF ME

1061
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,325
THAN JUST BEING A YOGA TEACHER.

1062
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,993
AND I THINK IT WILL HELP

1063
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:52,952
STRENGTHEN THE BONDS AND

1064
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,914
CONNECTIONS I HAVE WITH THEM AND

1065
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,708
WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET FURTHER IN

1066
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:09,844
THIS GAME.

♪ ♪ ♪

1068
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,222

FOR ME, PERSONALLY, EVERYONE

1070
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,310

00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,187
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1073
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,563
IT'S ALMOST LIKE I FORGET I'M IN

1074
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,230
A GAME.

1075
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,858
I THINK I JUST SIGNED UP FOR

1076
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:27,153
SOME HORRIBLE CAMPING TRIP.

1077
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,196
LAST TIME WHEN I PLAYED THIS

1078
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,156
GAME HIGHER THIS MASK ON.

1079
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,240
I WAS RUDE TO EVERYONE.

1080
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,533
I WAS MEAN TO EVERYONE.

1081
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,035
AND I DIDN'T HAVE KIND THINGS TO

1082
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:34,702
SAY.

1083
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,204
AND IT WAS ALL BECAUSE I WAS

1084
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:36,913
INSECURE.

1085
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,165
I ACTUALLY AM TRYING TO FIND AN

1086
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,209
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY TRY TO

1087
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,002
EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE AND GET THEM

1088
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,587
TO UNDERSTAND ME.

1089
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:49,258
WHERE I'M FROM, I LIVE WITH NINE

1090
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,052
MILLION PEOPLE IN MY STATE THAT

1091
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,012
HAVE THE SAME BELIEFS.

1092
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,098
WHAT I DON'T HAVE ARE PEOPLE

1093
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,183
THAT ARE WILLING TO LISTEN.

1094
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,061
I LIVE IN THE DEEP SOUTH WHERE

1095
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,771
BEING GAY, IT'S A CROSS TO BEAR

1096
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,897
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

1097
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,565
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I WAS THE

1098
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,235
SWEETEST KID IN THE WORLD.

1099
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,737
AND, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, SOMEWHERE

1100
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,906
ALONG THE WAY, I GOT TIRED OF

1101
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,367
BEING CALLED SISSY AND FAGGOT,

1102
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,913
AND YEAR.

1103
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:19,622
QUEER.

1104
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,998
THE STRUGGLE WAS GETTING PEOPLE

1105
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,291
TOND I'M A LIVING HUMAN BEING

1106
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,000
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

1107
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,169
I HAVE BATTLE THE WITH MY OWN

1108
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,254
FAMILY TRYING TO GET THEM TO

1109
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:26,963
UNDERSTAND, AND THERE ARE PEOPLE

1110
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,090
IN MY FAMILY THAT I DON'T HAVE

1111
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,925
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BECAUSE THEY

1112
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:33,219
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S LIKE

1113
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,095
OKAY TO LOVE ME.

1114
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:40,309
AND SO...

1115
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:51,821
>> OOOOH!

1116
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,114
>> THE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES THAT

1117
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,282
YOU GO THROUGH IN LIFE, I THINK

1118
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,950
THEY BUILD YOU TO THE PERSON

1119
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:56,909
THAT YOU ARE, YOU KNOW, TODAY.

1120
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,618
BUT I'M TRYING TO CHANGE.

1121
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,247
I'M JUST GOING IN WITH POSITIVE

1122
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:01,956
THINKING.

1123
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,624
>> YOU'RE DOING AWESOME AND YOUR

1124
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,125
GUY'S HERE UNDER THE SAME STARS

1125
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,627
YOU ARE.

1126
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,962
>> I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM.

1127
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:08,629
>> I KNOW.

1128
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,006
HE'S JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

1129
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,466
YOU'LL SEE HIM TOMORROW.

1130
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,258
FOR ALL OF US TO JUDGE WHAT

1131
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,762
DECISIONS HE MAKES IS HARD.

1132
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,473
WE HAVEN'T WALKED A MILE IN HIS

1133
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,475
SHOES, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S

1134
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,142
EASY.

1135
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:21,976
IF HE'S CHANGED, WOULDN'T THAT

1136
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,561
BE A BEAUTIFUL STORY?

1137
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,771
>> I'M SORRY.

1138
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,980
I'M SORRY.

1139
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:36,032
>> BUT THEN AGAIN, IT'S COLTON.

1140
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:41,704
>> BUT THEN AGAIN, IT'S COLTON.

1141
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,124
>> KAT.

1142
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,334
MONICA.

1143
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,001
LAURA

1144
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,379
THIS ONE IS FOR COLTON, JUST

1145
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,174
LIKE THIS.

1146
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,092
ONE OR TWO FOR EVERY PERSON WHO

1147
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,010
VOTED FOR ME.

1148
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,345
I DEFINITELY GOT MY FEEL, HURT

1149
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,347
BY THE RETURNING PLAYERS' TRIBE,

1150
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,224
AND I'M OUT FOR REVENGE.

1151
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,101
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN

1152
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,353
TO FIGHT AND TO WIN THIS GAME.

1153
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,438
>> YOU WANT ME TO RIP IT APART?

1154
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,648
>> NO, I GOT IT.

1155
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:12,026
I GOT TO CHOP A COUPLE MORE

1156
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:12,735
NAMES UP.

1157
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,986
I'M REALLY JUST TRYING TO KEEP

1158
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,198
MY MIND IN THE GAME AND MAINTAIN

1159
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,534
THE CAMP SO THAT I CAN STAY

1160
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,327
HEALTHY, HYDRATED, AND READY TO

1161
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:21,994
BEAT RUPERT.

1162
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,081
>> NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS

1163
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,999
WOULD I HAVE GUESSED I WOULD BE

1164
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,044
IN THIS POSITION ON THE SECOND

1165
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:30,503
DAY.

1166
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,880
>> ME, NEITHER.

1167
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,215
LIVING WITH RUPERT IS EXTREMELY

1168
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,968
ANNOYING, TO SAY THE LEAST.

1169
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:37,343
>> I'M GOING BACK IN THE WATER.

1170
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,054
>> OKAY.

1171
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:42,056
RUPERT MOSTLY IS EITHER SLEEPING

1172
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,850
OR SPLASHING AROUND IN THE

1173
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:44,350
WATER.

1174
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,685
I GET THE COCONUT.

1175
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,604
I GET ALL THE FIREWOOD.

1176
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,398
I GO GET ALL THE WATER.

1177
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,109
I TEND THE FIRE.

1178
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,068
I BOIL THE WATER.

1179
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,903
I BOIL THE RICE.

1180
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,906
AND RUPERT ENJOYS THE SPOILS.

1181
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,617
IT'S INFURIATING, ACTUALLY.

1182
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,412
>> SEE HOW COMFORTABLE A BED WE

1183
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,746
GOT.

1184
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,248
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE FLAT

1185
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,374
BOARDS ARE EVEN MORE COMFORTABLE

1186
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,794
THAN THE DAMN BAMBOO.

1187
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,297
I AM NOT GOING TO DO WHAT I'VE

1188
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,217
DONE SO MANY OTHER TIMES.

1189
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,969
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'VE

1190
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,262
NEVER WON AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

1191
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,265
IS I KILL MYSELF OUT FISHING.

1192
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,100
I KILL MYSELF OUT TAKING CARE OF

1193
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:26,934
MY TRIBE.

1194
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,977
( SNORING )

1195
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,270
BUT THIS IS MORE INDIVIDUAL.

1196
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,939
AND IF I'M GOING TO BEAT

1197
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:32,398
CANDICE, I NEED EVERY OUNCE OF

1198
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,441
ENERGY I GOT.

1199
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,277
IF CANDICE WANTS TO GO OUT AND

1200
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,904
KILL HERSELF GATHERING WOOD AND

1201
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,280
MAKING FIRE AND KEEPING IT GOING

1202
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,449
AND BOILING WATER AND DOING

1203
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,450
EVERYTHING, GREAT!

1204
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,784
BURN UP HER ENERGY.

1205
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,662
I'M NOT GOING TO.

1206
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,831
AND I NEED TO HAVE IN MY HEAD

1207
00:36:48,915 --> 00:37:01,135
THAT I WILL ELIMINATE HER.

1208
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:01,552
>> ALL RIGHT.

1209
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:01,969
THERE IT IS.

1210
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:02,720
>> TREE MAIL.

1211
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,971
>> RACHEL AND I GET UP AND WENT

1212
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,973
TO CHECK TREE MAIL.

1213
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,434
WE'RE LIKE OFFICIAL "SURVIVOR"

1214
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:08,976
PEOPLE NOW ALL RIGHT.

1215
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,270
>> IT LOOKS PRETTY.

1216
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,271
>> YEAH.

1217
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,315
IT'S REALLY EXCITING.

1218
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:14,982
UNTIL YOU'VE GOTTEN SOMETHING IN

1219
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,817
TREE MAIL YOU HAVEN'T STARTED

1220
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,443
THE GAME.

1221
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,486
>> I'LL CARRY THE FLAG.

1222
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,654
YOU CARRY THE MAIL.

1223
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:25,451
>> I FEEL LIKE SANTA CLAUS.

1224
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,495
>> WHOOO!

1225
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,288
>> TREE MAIL, TREE MAIL.

1226
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,666
>> I FEEL GREAT GOING INTO THE

1227
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,333
CHALLENGE.

1228
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,709
THE ADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE AS

1229
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,170
RETURNING PLAYERS IS WE KNOW

1230
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,839
KEEP YOUR HEAD IN IT, KEEP CALM.

1231
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,424
BECAUSE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

1232
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,843
>> EQUAL OF "WILL YOU CHOOSE TO

1233
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,470
STEP FORWARD TO RUN, JUMP, AND

1234
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,137
SWIM?

1235
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,514
WILL YOU PADDLE STRAIGHT THE

1236
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,474
FIRST TIME, YOUR CHANCES ARE

1237
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,560
PRETTY SLIM."

1238
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,521
>> "OR SHOULD YOU ASSEMBLE THE

1239
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,815
PIECES TO MAKE THE FLAG REALLY

1240
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:56,524
SPIN?

1241
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,525
WILL YOU BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

1242
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,401
WELL, NOT IF YOU WIN."

1243
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,402
>> THIS IS AWESOME.

1244
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,528
I THINK THIS IS MADE FOR US.

1245
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,655
>> RIGHT AWAY WE'RE TRYING TO

1246
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,531
THINK WHO IS THE FASTEST

1247
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,033
SWIMMER, WHO IS GOOD AT

1248
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:06,659
SPLINTING.

1249
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,494
WHO IS GOOD AT PUZZLES.

1250
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,412
>> I ALREADY KNOW MY MOTHER IS

1251
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,872
GOING TO DO THE PUZZLE.

1252
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,040
>> ARE YOU BETTER THAN HER.

1253
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:13,749
>> YES.

1254
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,543
>> MY MOM IS GREAT AT PUZZLES,

1255
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,210
TOO.

1256
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:16,877
SHE'S PROBABLY ON THE PUZZLE.

1257
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,753
I'M ON THE PUZZLE.

1258
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,048
IT'S GOING TO BE THE

1259
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:21,716
MOTHER-DAUGHTER DUEL.

1260
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,592
>> YOU TWO ON THE PUZZLE AGAINST

1261
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,553
YOUR MOM, AND THEN BEAT YOUR

1262
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,137
ASS.

1263
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,222
THAT WOULD BE SO AWESOME.

1264
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,932
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE

1265
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:35,062
NOT A FAST SWIMMER, JIMMER.

1266
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:35,730
IT'S ABOUT THE PUZZLE.

1267
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,399
>> PUZZLES ARE MY STRENGTH.

1268
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,525
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

1269
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:44,405
HOW DO WE DO DO THIS QUICKER.

1270
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,406
>> MOMS ALWAYS SAY, "I BROUGHT

1271
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,366
YOU INTO THIS WORLD.

1272
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,285
I CAN TAKE YOU OUT."

1273
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,578
>> AS MUCH AS I LOVE HER,

1274
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,663
UNFORTUNATELY, I WANT TO BEAT MY

1275
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,206
DAUGHTER IN THIS GAME.

1276
00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:03,382
SORRY, CIERA.

1277
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:12,433
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1278
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:20,441
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1279
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,485
ALL RIGHT.

1280
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,362
WELCOME TO YOUR FIRST IMMUNITY

1281
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,907
CHALLENGE.

1282
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,658
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, LAURA,

1283
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,286
MOMENTS INTO THE GAME-- YOU

1284
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,454
ALREADY KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO

1285
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,080
ASK YOU.

1286
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,289
YOU WANT YOUR REAL COLORS.

1287
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,957
>> I WANT MY COLORS.

1288
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,334
I'M A MEMBER OF THIS TEAM.

1289
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,460
>> Jeff: YOU ARE OFFICIALLY A

1290
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:39,877
MEMBER OF GALANG.

1291
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,295
HERE YOU GO.

1292
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:41,629
YOU CAN DROP YOUR RED ONE, LEAVE

1293
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,339
IT THERE.

1294
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,006
NO SOUVENIRS IN THIS GAME.

1295
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,424
COLTON, HOW HAS IT BEEN THE

1296
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,133
FIRST FEW DAYS OUT HERE?

1297
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,719
HAVE YOU GUYS HAD ANY LUCK WITH

1298
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,429
CAMP, FIRE, ANY OF THE

1299
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:50,971
NECESSITIES?

1300
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:51,764
>> YEAH, WE HAVE FIRE.

1301
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:52,473

1314
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,820
IS IT POSSIBLE THEY'RE JUST

1315
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,237
SAYING THAT?

1316
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,821
>> POSSIBLY.

1317
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,322
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1318
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:09,490
THAT'S GOOD.

1319
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,699

IT TOOK US A WHILE.

1329
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,505
>> THEY PROBABLY HAVE FIRE

1330
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,214
BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE.

1331
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,882
WE DON'T, BECAUSE WE'RE A BUNCH

1332
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,008

IMMUNITY KEEPS YOU SAFE FROM

1356
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,877
TRIBAL COUNCIL IS NOT WHERE YOU

1357
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,586

1358
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,211
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR

ONLY WAY YOU ENSURE YOU DON'T GO

1668
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,287
I GOT CREAMED BY MY MOTHER, AND

1669
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,288
THE FACT THAT THE THREE OF US,

1670
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,582
WANT PUZZLE PEOPLE, WERE THE

1671
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,417
REASON THAT WE DIDN'T PULL

1672
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,085
THROUGH AT THE END,UN, THAT

1673
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:47,794
MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.

1674
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,422
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO JUDGE THE

1675
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,798
VOTES OFF OF.

1676
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,133
>> POOR GERVASE, MAN.

1677
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,301
>> NOT POOR GERVASE.

1678
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,887
HE WAS THE LOUDEST ONE, LIKE,

1679
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,681
"THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT!"

1680
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:00,432
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

1681
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,308
>> HE IS SO FREAKING

1682
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,017
COMPETITIVE.

1683
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,852
I WAS NOT EXPECTING HIM TO THROW

1684
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,312
IT IN MY FACE LIKE THAT.

1685
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,856
I WAS JUST LIKE, GERVASE.

1686
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:08,482
CALM DOWN.

1687
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,067
YOU JUST SHOWED YOU'RE THE

1688
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,152
WEAKEST ATHLETIC PERSON ON YOUR

1689
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,237
TRIBE WITH THAT SWIM,

1690
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:14,946
PERFORMANCE.

1691
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,655
I DO THINK THE OTHER TRIBE WAS

1692
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,364
CELEBRATING TOO MUCH AFTER THAT

1693
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,824
WIN BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR LOVED

1694
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:18,492
ONES.

1695
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,327
YES, YOU WON, BUT GUESS WHAT?

1696
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,370
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEND ONE OF US

1697
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,121
HOME.

1698
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,665
WHO ARE THEY GOING TO CORRELATE

1699
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,792
GERVASE WITH?

1700
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,417
HIS NIECE.

1701
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,126
>> WE'RE GOING TO WIN SOME

1702
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,003
CHALLENGES, AND LET'S WIN WITH

1703
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:30,670
GRACE.

1704
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,546
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THEY WERULE

1705
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,214
JUMPING AROUND--

1706
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,215
>> WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE

1707
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,509
LION DOES NOT ROAR AFTER IT

1708
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,176
KILLS ITS PREY.

1709
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,844
>> THEY WERE ROARING AFTER

1710
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,678
KILLING THEIR CUBS.

1711
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,472
AND THE CUBS LOOK AT THEM AND

1712
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,681
GO, HMM.

1713
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,766
DOESN'T MAKE ME HAPPY.

1714
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,894
I DON'T WANT TO GLOAT OVER THEM

1715
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,187
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE A

1716
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:53,693
LOVED ONE.

1717
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,321
>> THE WAY IT WORKED OUT, GUYS

1718
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,824
VERSUS THE GIRLS, 5-4.

1719
00:51:58,907 --> 00:51:59,533
THERE WERE SEASONS PEOPLE WOULD

1720
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,408
KILL TO BE IN THE NUMBERS EARLY

1721
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,034
ON.

1722
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:01,743
>> WE HAVE FIVE STRONG.

1723
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,204
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BREAK IT UP.

1724
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,372
NOBODY IS GOING TO DRIVE A NAIL

1725
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,081
IN THIS.

1726
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,332
>> THE SOONER WE CAN FIGURE THIS

1727
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,084
OUT, THE LESS STRESS THERE WILL

1728
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:09,835
BE.

1729
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:10,585
WHOEVER WE VOTE OUT, WE HAVE TO

1730
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,546
REMEMBER, IS GOING TO BE A STAB

1731
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:20,887
IN SOMEBODY'S HEART TONIGHT.

1732
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,429
>> YEAH.

1733
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:21,972
YOU--

1734
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,223
>> I WAS JACKED UP.

1735
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,100
I-- I'M TELLING YOU, IT FELT

1736
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,351
LIKE SUNDAY AGAIN.

1737
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,561
IT IS.

1738
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,144
OPENING KICKOFF.

1739
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,063
>> AND I KNOW MONICA.

1740
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:30,730
I SAW HER OVER THERE.

1741
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,357
AND HER WHEELS-- I DON'T KNOW.

1742
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,068
I'M GLAD SHE DIDN'T REALLY GLOAT

1743
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:35,777
THAT MUCH.

1744
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:36,778
>> I THINK THERE'S SUCH A THING

1745
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,238
AS BEING A SORE WINNER, TOO.

1746
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,364
>> AND THAT WAS ROUGH.

1747
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,032
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

1748
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:41,616
I NOTICED THAT.

1749
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,742
I UNDERSTAND BEING HAPPY.

1750
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,578
BUT THERE'S A POINT WHERE WE

1751
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,954
NEED TO BE SMART ABOUT IT.

1752
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:46,621
I'LL TELL YOU I'M A LITTLE

1753
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,748
SPOILED ON MARISSA RIGHT NOW

1754
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,960
JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY GERVASE

1755
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:52,627
ACTED.

1756
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,336
MARIS ABEFORE WE WENT TO THE

1757
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,004
CHALLENGE, HE WAS A LITTLE BIT

1758
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:54,754
OFF THE RADAR, BUT THERE'S A

1759
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,091
SIDE OF MYSELF THAT SAW GERVASE

1760
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,802
JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND KIND OF

1761
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,762
IN YOUR FACE "WE WON."

1762
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,555
SHE'S GOING HOME.

1763
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,224
HOW DO YOU LIKE THOSE APPLES.

1764
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,102
GERVASE AIN'T THE PLAYER HE WAS

1765
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:09,811
THEN.

1766
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,271
I AM NOT BLAMING ANYBODY ON THE

1767
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:11,980
PUZZLE THEMSELVES.

1768
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,148
I'M THINKING GOING FORWARD WHO

1769
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,274
WILL BE OUR BEST ASSET.

1770
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,275
I DON'T KNOW.

1771
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,443
>> KATIE WAS KIND OF LIKE A

1772
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,193
THIRD WHEEL.

1773
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,446
>> WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HER,

1774
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,113
TOO.

1775
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,531
WITH THE PUZZLE PART, IT WAS

1776
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,451
CIERA, KATIE, AND ME.

1777
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,119
AND CIERA REALLY JUMPED IN.

1778
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,787
SHE WAS REALLY HELPFUL.

1779
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,123
AND IT JUST SEEMED LIKE KATIE,

1780
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,125
SHE WAS THE EXTRA COOK IN THE

1781
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:32,834
KITCHEN.

1782
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,419
>> HERE'S THE THING, KATIE IS A

1783
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:37,339
SMART GIRL AND SHE GOT TO THE

1784
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,048
PUZZLE AND--

1785
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,966
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE KATIE GO,

1786
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,343
BUT IF THE MAJORITY'S IN, THEN

1787
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:46,640
I'M IN WITH IT.

1788
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,474
>> BUT WE DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT

1789
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,684
KEEPING THE TRIBE STRONG.

1790
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,852
>> THE GIRLS PROBABLY KNOW THAT

1791
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,271
THE GUY BONDED.

1792
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,814
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT BEING SULT AT

1793
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,191
ALL TO THESE WOMEN SO IT'S

1794
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,151
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO KEEP MY

1795
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:58,818
ALLIANCES WITH THE GIRLS STRONG.

1796
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,987
I'M GOING TO TELL THE GIRLS,

1797
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,823
HEY, GIETS HAVE DECIDE WHICH ONE

1798
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,532
WILL GO FIRST.

1799
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,241
SOME OF THE GUYS CAME AND WERE

1800
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,327
TALKING ABOUT MARISSA BECAUSE

1801
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,703
GERVASE AT THE END.

1802
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:09,329
>> GOTCHA.

1803
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,289
>> I THINK IN THE END THEY

1804
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,040
DECIDE PEOPLE DECIDED THAT IT

1805
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,834
WOULD BE THE PUZZLE BUILDERS.

1806
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:15,377
KATIE.

1807
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,086
>> LET'S BE HONEST.

1808
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,170
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHOEVER THEY

1809
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,838
CHOOSE TO VOTE FOR.

1810
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,839
THE GUYS HAVE DEFINITELY BONDED

1811
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,423
WITH EACH OTHER.

1812
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,217
I FEEL BAD FOR THE GIRLS.

1813
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,678
BUT AT THIS POINT IT WOULD BE

1814
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,346
FOOLISH TO TRY TO GO AGAINST

1815
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,974
THAT.

1816
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,059
>> WE'RE FIVE GUYS STRONG.

1817
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,727
ONE OF THE GIRLS HAS TO GO.

1818
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,729
SO IT MAY BE MARISSA.

1819
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,689
IT MAY BE KATIE.

1820
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,983
TO ME, THEY'RE ALL EQUAL OPINION

1821
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,025
THE GIRLS ARE BOTH CONNECTED

1822
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:39,693
WITH THE OTHER TRIBE.

1823
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,528
WE'VE GOT TO START THINKING

1824
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,364
ABOUT WHO WE VOTE OUT COULD

1825
00:54:44,447 --> 00:55:19,941
POTENTIALLY AFFECT THEIR TRIBE.

1826
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,902
>> Jeff: GO AHEAD AND GRAB A

1827
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:23,611
TORCH.

1828
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,280
APPROACH THE FLAME, DIP IT IN,

1829
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:30,201
AND GET FIRE

1830
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:33,246
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

1831
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:33,955
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1832
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:34,873
IN THIS GAIRNLG FIRE REPRESENTS

1833
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:38,585
YOUR LIFE

1834
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,421
ALL RIGHT, FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL,

1835
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,922
NOT THE PLACE YOU WANT TO BE,

1836
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,924
BUT SOMEBODY'S GET TO BE HERE.

1837
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,051
HAYDEN, WHAT'S BEEN THE TOUGHEST

1838
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,427
PART OF THE FIRST FEW DAYS FOR

1839
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,011
YOU?

1840
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:48,720
>> TRYING TO CREATE FIRE.

1841
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,055
>> Jeff: SO YOU GUYS WERE

1842
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,264
LYING TO ME TODAY.

1843
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:51,973
YOU DONT HAVE FIRE.

1844
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:56,061
>> YEAH, WE WERE TOTAL BLUFFING.

1845
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,395
>> Jeff: SKIER AYOU HAD TO

1846
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,147
TALK TO YOUR MOM A LOT ABOUT HER

1847
00:55:59,230 --> 00:55:59,939
EXPERIENCE OUT HERE.

1848
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,441
HOW MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IS IT

1849
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,442
ONCE YOU'RE OUT HERE.

1850
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,277
>> HAVING MY MOM TELL ME STORIES

1851
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,154
AND ACTUALLY BEING OUT HERE IS

1852
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:06,821
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

1853
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,615
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS

1854
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,324
HUNGRY.

1855
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,284
I'M LIKE, OKAY, SOMEBODY IS JUST

1856
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,788
TRYING TO GET OUT OF MY RIGHT

1857
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,622
NOW, CLAWING AT MY INSIDE, SO TO

1858
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,625
EXPERIENCE IT IS REALLY ROUGH.

1859
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,754
>> Jeff: CULL CULPEPPER,

1860
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:23,463
YOU'RE THREE DAYS IN AND

1861
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,172
OBVIOUSLY STRUGGLING.

1862
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,801
>> IT'S FRUSTRATING NOT HAVING

1863
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:28,510
FIRE.

1864
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,845
IF WE GET FIRE WE COOK AND GET

1865
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,808
STRONG AND WIN IMMUNITY

1866
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,350
CHALLENGEES.

1867
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,059
>> Jeff: CALEB, HOW DOES

1868
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,936
HAVING LOVED ONES ON THE OTHER

1869
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:38,645
TRIBE CHANGE THIS GAME?

1870
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,188
>> IT DOES COMPLICATE IT.

1871
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,648
HE DOESN'T WHAT'S GOING ON OVER

1872
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:42,649
THERE JUST LIKE I DON'T KNOW

1873
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,858
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE.

1874
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:44,651
YOU HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER

1875
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,486
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THE

1876
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,195
RIGHT THING.

1877
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:47,862
RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE DOING THEIR

1878
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,615
THING AND WE HAVE TO DO OUR

1879
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,324
THING.

1880
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,785
>> Jeff: MOMENTS INTO DAY ONE,

1881
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,995
THE WOMAN YOU LOVE IS VOTED OUT.

1882
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:56,663
>> RIGHT.

1883
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,581
>> Jeff: YOU WERE GIVEN THE

1884
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,499
CHANCE TO TAKE HER SPOT.

1885
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,168
DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS ABOUT

1886
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,044
NOT TAKING HER SPOT?

1887
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,421
>> I HAVE A LOT OF REGRETS.

1888
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,798
AS A HUSBAND IT'S SOMETHING I

1889
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:11,219
STRUGGLE WITH AND I FEEL LIKE...

1890
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,304
I JUST EYE FEEL LIKE CANDICE IS

1891
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:13,972
PROBABLY SITTING THERE ON

1892
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,474
REDEMPTION ISLAND THINKING I

1893
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,143
JUST... JUST... LET HER GO.

1894
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,228
AND JUST, LIKE LET HER DOWN,

1895
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:23,898
DIDN'T STAND UP FOR HER.

1896
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,358
I'M HOPING SHE'S NOT THINKING

1897
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:26,067
THAT BUT IT'S SOMETHING I'VE

1898
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,153
BEEN STRUGGLING WITH A LITTLE

1899
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:28,862
BIT.

1900
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:29,696
>> Jeff: WHAT'S THAT IMPACT--

1901
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,115
YOU, KNOWING WHOEVER YOU VOTE

1902
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:35,034
OUT TONIGHT LBL COMPETING

1903
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,369
AGAINST YOUR WIFE AND RUPERT IN

1904
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:37,829
THE FIRST DUEL AT REDEMPTION?

1905
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:38,580
>> IF TODAY'S CHALLENGE SPEAKS

1906
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,623
TO ANYTHING, IT REALLY SHOWS

1907
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,542
THAT OUR LOVED ONES ON THE OTHER

1908
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,586
TRIBE ARE NOT GOING TO PULL ANY

1909
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,295
PUNCHES.

1910
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,212
SO MY VOTE TONIGHT IS GOING TO

1911
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,714
BE WAISED ON WHO I THINK IS

1912
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,425
GOING TO MAKE THIS TRIBE

1913
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,217
STRONGEST GOING FORWARD.

1914
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,261
IF THERE IS AN ADDED ADVANTAGE

1915
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:57,015
THEY I THINK CANDICE CAN KICK

1916
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,267
WHOEVER'S BUTT, THAT'S GREAT,

1917
00:57:59,350 --> 00:57:59,934
TOO.

1918
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,060
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER, WHERE DO

1919
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,562
YOU SEE THIS GAME GOING, THE

1920
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,229
BLOOD VERSUS THE WATER?

1921
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:03,938
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

1922
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,608
>> I THINK IT WAS AN INTERESTING

1923
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,067
DYNAMIC TODAY WHEN WE LOST

1924
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,945
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE

1925
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:11,779
CELEBRATING SO MUCH ON THEIR END

1926
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,615
BECAUSE ONE OF THEIR LOVED ONES

1927
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,324
IS GOING HOME.

1928
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,409
>> Jeff: WHO WAS CELEBRATING?

1929
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:17,952
WHO STOOD OUT?

1930
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,120
>> Jeff: GERVASE.

1931
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,914
>> Jeff: MARISSA, YOU'RE

1932
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,082
SHAKING YOUR HEAD AT YOUR OWN

1933
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:23,708
UNCLE.

1934
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,460
>> YES, BECAUSE THEY WERE

1935
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,127
CELEBRATING LIKE THAT.

1936
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,587
I THINK OF THEM AS VETERANS,

1937
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,255
MORE MATURE, WISER.

1938
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,090
I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO HANDLE

1939
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:31,758
IT WITH GRACE.

1940
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,927
>> Jeff: VYTAS CIT WORK

1941
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,596
AGAINST YOU IF YOUR LOVED ONE

1942
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,347
BEHAVES THIS WAY?

1943
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,432
>> OF COURSE, SOMEBODY GLOATING

1944
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:41,935
IN OUR FACE ADDS INSULT TO

1945
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:42,602
INJURY.

1946
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,061
THIS TWIST IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY

1947
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:43,770
OTHER SEASON.

1948
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,731
NO TEAM WHO WINS IMMUNITY IS

1949
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,107
WORRYING THE NIGHT THE THE OTHER

1950
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,108
TEAM GOES TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1951
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,443
I GUARANTEE YOU TONIGHT, THAT

1952
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:51,110
TEAM IS WORRYING, BECAUSE WHEN

1953
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,655
THEY SEE US THE NEXT TIME AT A

1954
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,364
CHALLENGE.

1955
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,823
THANE ONE OF THEIR LOVED ONES IS

1956
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,492
GOING TO BE GONE.

1957
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,910
>> Jeff: MARIS ACONCERNED AT

1958
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,328
ALL WE WHAT VYTAS SAID?

1959
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,746
>> YES, BECAUSE I'M GUILTY BY

1960
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,330
ASSOCIATION.

1961
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,790
I WISH GERVASE WOULD HAVE

1962
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,459
PIEPPED DOWN AT THE MOMENT SO I

1963
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:07,961
WOULD FEEL A LITTLE LESS

1964
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,295
VULNERABLE RIGHT NOW.

1965
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,296
>> Jeff: WOW.

1966
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:10,964
THAT WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO GET

1967
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,632
VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME FOR

1968
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:13,633
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO BUT YOUR

1969
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,050
UNCLE DID.

1970
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,469
>> EXACTLY.

1971
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:17,929
BUT, I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE SHOULD

1972
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:18,763
JUST BE JUDGING ME ON MY

1973
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,598
PERFORMANCE, MY CHARACTER, MY

1974
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,309
ADD OF ATTITUDE, NOT MY LOVED

1975
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,060
ONE'S.

1976
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,311
IT COMES DOWN TO OUR TRIBE, NOT

1977
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,646
WHAT THEIR TRIBE IS DOING.

1978
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,148
WAIT UNTIL WE GET TO THE MERGE

1979
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,608
AND THEN YOU CAN DECIDE IF YOU

1980
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,986
WANT TO JUDGE ME BECAUSE OF HIS

1981
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:33,695
ACTIONS.

1982
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,779
>> Jeff: KATIE, WHERE WERE YOU

1983
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:38,032
AT FOR THE FIRST VOTE?

1984
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,158
YOU VALLEY SO LITTLE TO GO ON?

1985
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,326
>> I MEAN, THE CHALLENGE TODAY,

1986
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:40,994
I THINK THE FIRST LEG OF THE

1987
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,496
RACE, THE GUYS DID REALLY GREAT.

1988
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:45,206
AND THE PUZZLE MAKERS FELL

1989
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,749
BEHIND AND SO THE FEAR TONIGHT

1990
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,669
IS BASED OFF OF THE CHALLENGE.

1991
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,086
THAT'S ONE THING TO JUDGE OUR

1992
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,297
VOTES OFF OF.

1993
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:52,755
SO, YOU KNOW, THERE IS SOME

1994
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,423
FEAR.

1995
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,007
>> Jeff: WOULD IT BE FAIR TO

1996
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,675
VOTE YOU OFF FOR ONE POOR

1997
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:59,178
PERFORMANCE IN YOUR FIRST-EVER

1998
00:59:59,262 --> 00:59:59,846
"SURVIVOR" CHALLENGE?

1999
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,681
>> I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

2000
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,017
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER, IF YOU

2001
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,476
HAVE TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT, AND

2002
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,019
YOU CAN'T FIND ANY OTHER REASON,

2003
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,146
THEN IT COULD BE TODAY'S

2004
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:08,855
CHALLENGE.

2005
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:09,814
>> YEAH, OBVIOUSLY, IF THEY HAD

2006
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,899
HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IT WOULD

2007
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,693
HAVE ELEVATED THEIR LEVEL IN THE

2008
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,569
TRIBE RIGHT NOW.

2009
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,071
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE ALL

2010
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,156
JUDGING SOLELY ON THE

2011
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,199
PERFORMANCE OF THE PUZZLE

2012
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,909
MAKERS.

2013
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,370
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

2014
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,164
TO VOTE.

2015
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:36,215
CALEB, YOU'RE UP.

2016
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:43,639
CALEB, YOU'RE UP.

2017
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,183
>> MARACE, YOU'RE A GREAT GIRL,

2018
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,893
BUT I'M SORRY, THE GAME HAS

2019
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:57,862
STARTED.

2020
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:11,751
>> IT'S EITHER YOU OR ME.

2021
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,252
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

2022
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:22,762
VOTES.

2023
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,139
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

2024
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,057
DECISION IS FINAL.

2025
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,767
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

2026
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:28,351
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

2027
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:28,893
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

2028
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:32,939
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

2029
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:39,487
FIRST VOTE, KATIE.

2030
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,155
