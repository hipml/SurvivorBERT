>> JEFF PROBST: Previously, on

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,920
<i>Survivor:</i>
At Drake, being undefeated

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,548
had its drawbacks.
>> I'm saying that a little

4
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,925
more help would be appreciated.
>> It's starting to get annoying

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,928
because we really want somebody
to leave.

6
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,431
>> PROBST: At Morgan, the tide
was up and spirits were down.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,808
>> I think it's us against
everything else out here.

8
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,602
>> PROBST: At the reward
challenge, Osten almost drowned.

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,104
>> I need help!
>> PROBST: While Andrew and Ryno

10
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,814
saved him, Drake won their sixth
straight victory.

11
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:27,944
Drake wins reward!
In the dark of night, Burton

12
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:30,780
approached Rupert with a plan.
>> At some point, we should

13
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,949
lose.
We can do it, but we have to get

14
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,451
rid of Christa.
>> He's a traitor.

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,787
If this was a pirate culture,
he'd already be dead.

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,831
>> PROBST: Reluctant to go along
with the plan, Rupert sat out

17
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,750
while his tribe threw the
immunity challenge.

18
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:46,254
Morgan wins immunity!
But a surprise twist allowed

19
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:50,258
Morgan to kidnap one Drake
member until the next challenge.

20
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,302
Who's it going to be, Savage?
>> Rupert.

21
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,429
>> PROBST: Rupert became a
temporary member of the Morgan

22
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,389
Tribe.
>> It's all good.

23
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,308
>> PROBST: Back at Drake, Jon
was playing both sides of

24
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,768
the fence.
>> I got a five-way alliance

25
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,271
with Trish, Rupert, Christa and
Sandra.

26
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:07,776
And I have a four-way alliance
with Shawn, Burton and Michelle.

27
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,652
I'm a freakin' puppet master.
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

28
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,488
Burton's plan to throw the
immunity challenge backfired,

29
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,491
when the majority of his tribe,
including his ally Shawn, voted

30
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:20,497
him out.
12 are left.

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:30,715
Who will be voted out tonight?
(theme song playing)

32
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:11,005
♪ ♪
>> Well, well, well.

33
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:35,530
♪ ♪
>> Well, well, well.

34
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,116
I know what Shawn wrote on his
card.

35
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,702
>> My card said "Burton."
(Jon chuckles)

36
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,786
>> Shawn's card did say
"Burton."

37
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,206
Last night, en route to
Tribal Council, I looked over

38
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,917
at Shawn and I said, "I got
a little information for you.

39
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,087
Burton's gone.
Vote however you want.

40
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,425
I suggest you write 'Burton.'"
(laughs)

41
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,927
>> I had a core alliance which
consisted of myself, Burton,

42
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:04,225
Michelle and, I thought, Jon.
I've always been a little weary

43
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,603
of Burton, and, um, to be honest
with you, I've been looking

44
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,855
for a way to get rid of him.
Hey, listen, Burton annoyed me

45
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,690
more than... more than you
think.

46
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,775
(Jon laughs)
>> Oh, I find that hard to

47
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,110
believe.
>> Do you really?

48
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,945
>> Yeah.
>> Well, then, you're wrong,

49
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,406
because he did.
>> The joke to me was Shawn

50
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,242
just starts trashing Burton.
I was insulted.

51
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,288
You know, it's like, "How stupid
do you think we are?"

52
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,624
I mean, you were with him for
13 days.

53
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,334
>> He thought he was better
than everyone else on this

54
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,252
tribe, and that bothered me.
We were tight, but you know

55
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,922
what?
This is not a game about tight,

56
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,257
this is a game about strategy,
and for me, he was going to get

57
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,510
voted out, regardless.
So, I placed the vote, and I

58
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,137
shocked a couple of people
who had no idea I was going

59
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,805
to do it.
'Cause he was constantly wanting

60
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,975
people to do, it his way,
Burton's way.

61
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,810
Y-You know, it's like, well,
hello?

62
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,479
There's more than one person
here.

63
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,190
Michelle is the one right now
who's clinging for her life,

64
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,276
because everyone knows she
voted against Christa.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,153
And the other person who voted
against Christa's no longer

66
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,656
here.
>> Michelle, everyone here knows

67
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,115
what name you wrote on that
card.

68
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,951
I want you to know it doesn't
matter.

69
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,619
It doesn't.
It really doesn't.

70
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,455
>> They're saying, "Oh, now
everything's fine."

71
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:11,668
I'm like, "Everything's fine?"
>> Good night.

72
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,338
>> Good night.
I'm in trouble.

73
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,509
I am out here completely by
myself.

74
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,985
>> When I first got to the
Morgan camp, the beach was

75
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,363
pounding away at their shelter.
The surf is coming up, and

76
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,824
they don't realize that, as the
moon is changing, the tide's

77
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,576
going to raise another two
or three feet.

78
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,831
And they're using logs to try
and stop the tide from taking

79
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:54,419
their shelter away.
It's not going to work.

80
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,045
You need to tear your shelter
down and rebuild your shelter

81
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,213
today.
>> Yeah.

82
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:00,383
Right now, we decided to go
ahead and move our shelter,

83
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,844
'cause, according to Rupert,
by the time the full moon comes,

84
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,347
it's going to... it would have
destroyed that shelter, with

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,392
the waves and stuff.
And just kind of clear some

86
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,061
of this stuff out.
So, we're going to move our

87
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,690
shelter 40 feet inland, more
towards the jungle.

88
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,527
>> What... how is this going to
be set up, now?

89
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,114
This is absurd.
We haven't actually got hit by

90
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:27,076
the water yet, so, my thought's,
"Wait till it becomes a problem,

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,579
then deal with it."
But they think it's a state of

92
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:34,917
emergency.
>> So, what do you think?

93
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,086
>> Looks good.
O.T. said, "Why don't we just

94
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,422
move it straight back, instead
of all the way over here?"

95
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:44,177
>> Up here to right here.
>> I mean, that's a smart idea

96
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,096
he had, just move it right here.
And this whole fire needs to get

97
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,682
moved.
>> Right this second?

98
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,893
>> There are reasons not to do
it over there?

99
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,770
>> But if you guys want it
over there, and it's a unanimous

100
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,272
vote... well, not a unanimous
vote, but...

101
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,733
>> I just don't agree with
moving it close to the jungle.

102
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,401
We'll get destroyed by
mosquitoes, "A," and then

103
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,279
potentially get lit up by a
snake, "B."

104
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,908
>> Osten was pretty aggravated,
because he was just wanting to

105
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,951
move it up from where we were
at.

106
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,953
But that way, we're going to
have to dig up the whole fire

107
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,749
pit and move all the logs.
>> Oh.

108
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,753
>> These guys work very hard
at not working.

109
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,923
They fight and argue and bicker
and bitch amongst each other

110
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,676
so much that I know why it takes
them hours to do anything.

111
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,262
I know why they don't really do
great in the challenges.

112
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,306
I know why they're not really a
great team.

113
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,311
>> Make a vote, I guess.
Who's for here?

114
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,442
>> Osten, he had an idea, and
everybody kind of shot it down.

115
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,320
We're going to move our shelter
a little bit inland, more

116
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,156
towards the jungle, a little bit
higher ground.

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:56,290
>> Let's go.
>> It's kind of like remodeling

118
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:06,342
a house with four bad walls.
>> I want a can of something.

119
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:15,601
a house with four bad walls.
>> I want a can of something.

120
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,186
>> Well, don't we have an extra
can of Spam?

121
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,521
>> Yeah.
>> We do?

122
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,690
(mutters)
Are we going to wait for Rupert

123
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,859
before we open that?
>> Yep.

124
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,695
>> I hope we get him back.
>> Yeah.

125
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,030
>> Rupert right now is with the
Morgan Tribe.

126
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,074
He's got to sort of hang out
with the enemy and get to know

127
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,243
them a little bit.
My concern with Rupert is that

128
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,872
I'm afraid he's giving away
too much information about us

129
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,374
and not realizing it.
>> Well, you know they're

130
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,209
telling that the Morgans are
just like...

131
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,088
(scoffs)
"You're... you're safe with us."

132
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,550
You know, anything in the world.
>> Buttering him up?

133
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,511
>> Mm-hmm.
>> I want Rupert back, 'cause I

134
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,597
want to find out what all
happened over there, what they

135
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,350
talked about, um, if he gave out
any pertinent information...

136
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,728
Everybody's kind of, um,
tripping.

137
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,521
They don't know if Rupert went
to the other side.

138
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:05,234
>> Three days is a long time to
spend with another tribe.

139
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,578
>> I've been dying of thirst
since I've been here.

140
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,247
I've been hungry since I've
been here.

141
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,292
Maybe, at least for lunch, I can
get a... a belly full of fish.

142
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,378
>> Rupert, you see all those
fish jumping out there?

143
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,381
I think they're waiting for you.
>> I know they are.

144
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,259
I'm hoping to take Ryan out
there, and I'll swim around

145
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,638
with him and just kind of be
his buddy and see if he can go

146
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,431
catch a fish.
>> I thought you had to throw it

147
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,891
down, and...
>> No, no.

148
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,560
No throwing.
Get it in the crotch of your

149
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,605
hand.
Get it cocked, dive down, get

150
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,317
under a rock.
>> That's incredible.

151
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,654
Thank God we got you over here,
'cause I had no... no idea

152
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,740
on that, how that sling deal
worked.

153
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,784
>> Ryno?
Nice young kid, very willing

154
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,454
to learn, wanting to be the
provider.

155
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,123
Not knowing how to do the
providing.

156
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,253
Willing to learn on the spear.
Willing to go out with me.

157
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:15,304
I'm very comfortable with him.
Let's open the bag.

158
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:32,613
I'm very comfortable with him.
Let's open the bag.

159
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:47,336
(Rupert yells)
>> We had one beautiful one that

160
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,881
was almost in the bag, and...
Ryan lost it, and...

161
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,967
I screamed real loud at him,
and...

162
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,345
I feel bad for him.
>> We let one go.

163
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,972
It was about this big... or I
did.

164
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,183
>> Why'd you let it go?
>> I didn't let him go, I was

165
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,645
trying to get him off the spear.
>> He tell you about the ones

166
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,897
that got away?
These make it better.

167
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,358
>> Nicely done, fellow!
(laughing)

168
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,445
Nicely done.
>> Rupert's been a godsend.

169
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,032
He's an absolute workaholic,
work ethic is impeccable.

170
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,908
>> We eat a little lunch.
>> Oh, my God!

171
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,452
>> I got to... I got to clean
and gut them, so...

172
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,203
>> We'll make... we'll make some
lunch.

173
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,913
>> Ah!
Mmm...

174
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,374
>> Ah, thank you, baby.
>> Probably the smartest thing

175
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,835
this tribe ever did was get a
hold of Rupert.

176
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:37,887
(chuckles)
>> We got tree mail.

177
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:53,652
(chuckles)
>> We got tree mail.

178
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,572
>> Tree mail?
>> "Paddle on the clue, does it

179
00:10:56,655 --> 00:11:00,659
give it all away?
Or the foreshadowing of a part

180
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,372
of what you'll face today.
Running through the jungle

181
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,709
for the best reward yet, staying
dry when you want to, get

182
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,421
cleaner when you're wet."
(gasps)

183
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,215
>> That tree mail, I'm really
excited.

184
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,385
>> It mentioned there's a
possibility we would be

185
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,511
clean somehow.
So we figured we would

186
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,597
potentially get something that
would dry us off and then

187
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,432
something that would keep us
clean.

188
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,769
>> I love Drake, and I don't
really want to beat them, but I

189
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,814
want to beat them bad and show
them, you know, the reason that

190
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:34,026
they've been winning might have
something to do with me.

191
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:44,829
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.
Take a spot on your mat.

192
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,290
Morgan, getting your first look
at the new Drake Tribe.

193
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,836
Rupert, getting your first look
at your tribe without Burton.

194
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,921
For the time being, you're still
with Morgan.

195
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,924
All right, let's get to it.
For today's reward challenge,

196
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,468
you will paddle out in boats
to a series of four wooden

197
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,721
crates.
At each crate, one tribe member

198
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,474
will dive down and retrieve two
pieces to a ladder.

199
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,978
Once you have all eight pieces,
you'll paddle back and begin to

200
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,439
assemble the ladder.
The ladder is a puzzle.

201
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,232
Each rung has a different shaped
end.

202
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,818
Fit the ends into the holes in
the sides to complete the

203
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,154
ladder.
At the same time, one member

204
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,991
from each tribe will split off,
race deep into the jungle to an

205
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,077
old Spanish well where you will
retrieve a golden idol sitting

206
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,371
at the bottom of the well.
Once you have your ladder

207
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,499
assembled and you have the
golden idol in your hand, one

208
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,710
tribe member will race up the
ladder.

209
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,712
First tribe to get their golden
idol at the top of the pedestal

210
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,338
wins reward.
Want to know what you're playing

211
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,673
for?
>> Yeah.

212
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:41,218
>> Hell, yeah.
>> PROBST: It's a water reward.

213
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,637
>> Yes.
>> PROBST: Several items:

214
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,640
portable shower, pot for boiling
water, two jerricans for

215
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,393
transporting water, rain
jackets, loofah, sponges,

216
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:54,523
shampoo, conditioner,
everything you need to get

217
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,402
clean, and if Morgan should win,
we still have the first piece

218
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,363
to your buried treasure.
Drake has already found theirs

219
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,365
and enjoyed it.
In addition, for the winning

220
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,368
tribe, a chance to loot from the
other tribe, something Morgan

221
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,289
has yet to enjoy.
Drake knows how delicious that

222
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,875
can be.
A lot at stake.

223
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,505
Wait for my "Go."
Here we go guys, for reward.

224
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,759
Survivors ready.
Go!

225
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:35,523
Drake out first.
Morgan right behind.

226
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:42,780
>> We're gaining.
>> PROBST: Drake having a lot of

227
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,907
trouble steering their boat.
Morgan at box number one,

228
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:54,917
Rupert in for Morgan.
Morgan has their first pieces.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,797
Drake at box number one.
Shawn diving down.

230
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:11,976
Morgan on to their second box.
Drake still trying to get to

231
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,603
their second box.
>> Let's go!

232
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,066
>> PROBST: Morgan looking for
the set of puzzle pieces.

233
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:26,073
(indistinct shouting)
Rupert doing a heck of a job

234
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,742
for Morgan.
Shawn dives down looking for

235
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:36,458
more.
(indistinct chatter)

236
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,711
>> Start going, guys!
>> PROBST: Morgan with a big

237
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,213
lead.
>> Come on, you got to steer

238
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,756
port.
>> I am steering port.

239
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,300
>> You're steering the wrong
way.

240
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,262
>> PROBST: Drake is completely
out of course.

241
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,847
>> To the other side, yeah.
>> On the right side!

242
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,432
>> Right side, hard.
>> Right side.

243
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,143
>> Hard, guys.
>> PROBST: Morgan is at their

244
00:14:54,226 --> 00:15:01,859
last two puzzle pieces.
>> Yeah!

245
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,820
>> PROBST: Drake working their
way back on to the course.

246
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:09,491
Jon is using the rudder as a
paddle and not to steer.

247
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,328
(grunts)
Morgan has all eight puzzle

248
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:17,791
pieces.
Turning around and heading back.

249
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,960
Morgan racing back to the
finish.

250
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,296
Drake, still in the middle of
the course, looking for their

251
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,842
third set of puzzle pieces.
(indistinct shouting)

252
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,183
Drake has six pieces now,
looking for their last two.

253
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:39,688
Drake is at their last two
puzzle pieces.

254
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,857
Once you hit the sand, you can
get out.

255
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,027
(indistinct chatter)
Through the course, Andrew.

256
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,782
Through the checkpoint.
Andrew off to the Spanish well.

257
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:02,086
>> Left, everybody!
Everybody on the left!

258
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,006
>> Come on, Jon.
(indistinct shouting)

259
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,676
>> Left!
Left!

260
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,389
>> PROBST: Drake finally working
their way back to shore.

261
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:18,769
(indistinct chatter)
Morgan still with a big lead.

262
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:28,237
Don't blow it on the ladder.
>> Go!

263
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,281
>> Run, run!
>> PROBST: Through the

264
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:35,577
checkpoint, Michelle, and around
the other flag.

265
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,414
Let's go, Drake.
Welcome to the contest.

266
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,250
>> Get on that end...
>> PROBST: Andrew back with the

267
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,294
idol.
(indistinct chatter)

268
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,380
Drake, glad you could join us.
>> Oh, oh.

269
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,258
>> PROBST: Morgan has it
assembled, putting the cotter

270
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,218
pins in.
Michelle deep in the jungle

271
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,430
looking for an idol that's
not going to matter.

272
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,725
Andrew has the idol in hand,
ladder going up against the

273
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,435
tower.
>> Go!

274
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,437
Go!
>> PROBST: Savage gets the

275
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,065
honor.
>> Yeah!

276
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,776
>> PROBST: And just like that...
>> Oh!

277
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,904
>> Yeah!
>> PROBST: Morgan wins reward!

278
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:15,617
Two challenges in a row!
>> Yeah!

279
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,872
Give me a hug.
>> PROBST: Morgan,

280
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,333
congratulations.
Two challenges in a row.

281
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,919
Very valuable.
Your first piece to your buried

282
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,630
treasure.
The water reward will be waiting

283
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,968
for you back at camp, which
means, Rupert, if you want to

284
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,263
shower and shampoo and all that
stuff, you can go back to

285
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,266
Morgan, indulge, and then return
to Drake, or if you want, skip

286
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:43,645
the reward, go back to Drake
now.

287
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,983
(applause)
>> I love you guys, but I want

288
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,318
to go home.
>> PROBST: Okay, one other

289
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,779
thing.
Select one tribe member that

290
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,031
will get to visit Drake's
camp, and help yourself to one

291
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,910
of their items.
Drake, head back.

292
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,179
>> This was the first time that
I've seen the Drake Tribe

293
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,307
nervous.
The first challenge that we

294
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,018
just really smoked those guys.
A lot of it was Rupert, but if

295
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,020
you saw us in the boat, the
Morgan Tribe was perfectly in

296
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,855
sync.
We're on a high.

297
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,066
We've proven to ourselves that
we can win.

298
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,026
And I think that's...
In this game, it's a mental

299
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:34,029
game, and that's critical.
>> I haven't smelled something

300
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:37,658
that smells so good in a long
while.

301
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,035
>> I just cannot wait to wash
my body.

302
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,538
It just...
I just feel like the nastiest

303
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,041
person on Earth right now.
>> I don't care much for smells

304
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,211
like this back home, but, smells
really good.

305
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,881
>> We have a hanging portable
shower that we're going to latch

306
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,051
up to, a... a palm tree.
Take five gallons, and

307
00:18:56,134 --> 00:19:01,181
everyone's going to shower.
It's absolutely fabulous.

308
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,685
>> The shower worked out fine.
I think the guys respected us,

309
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,854
you know.
They wasn't really watching us,

310
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,523
so, um, you know, I respect
them for respecting us.

311
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,442
So, you know, if they'll do
that every time I take a shower,

312
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:16,655
I'm fine with it.
>> The Morgan Tribe seems to be

313
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,907
riding a high, and it's... it's
great.

314
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,909
I... I like that.
It's... it's a positive

315
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:28,959
attitude.
>> None of us knew how to

316
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,586
steer.
>> I should have been in the

317
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,212
back.
>> And you stepped up to the

318
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,256
plate and said that you would.
>> But, more importantly,

319
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,092
welcome back this guy.
>> Yeah.

320
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,095
I love being back home.
When Jeff said, "You can enjoy

321
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:44,725
your bounty or go home," there
wasn't even a question.

322
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,602
I didn't look back.
I come home.

323
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,854
I didn't need to go share in the
loot.

324
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,274
I need to go bond with my tribe.
>> How was Jenny Craig Island?

325
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,276
(laughs)
>> Hey, come and tell us, what's

326
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,777
going on over there?
>> Yeah, what's going on over

327
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,654
there?
>> A hand full of rice was your

328
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,448
meal.
They have almost no food.

329
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,741
>> They... they can only take
one thing.

330
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,493
>> They have two meals of beans
left and two meals of rice left,

331
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,622
and that's all they have left.
Osten doesn't get in the water,

332
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,207
doesn't go in the jungle,
doesn't get water, doesn't

333
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,294
grab firewood.
>> Did they try to recruit you

334
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,795
the whole time?
>> They knew I was not going

335
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,089
anywhere.
They know that a Drake is going

336
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,592
to win this whole damn thing.
(indistinct chatter)

337
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,760
Thank God, I am so happy I am
back.

338
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,970
>> Oh, you been missed, man.
>> You're gonna eat good, too,

339
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,097
you're gonna eat good.
>> You been missed big time.

340
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,809
>> You're gonna eat good.
>> Here they come, guys.

341
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,938
>> This should be very
interesting.

342
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:40,322
>> I think he's coming with a
peace offering.

343
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,951
>> Big Jon.
What's up?

344
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,286
>> Welcome to Drakeland.
>> Good to see you.

345
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,332
>> Hey, this is from everyone.
>> Good to see you.

346
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,250
You can take whatever the ...
you want.

347
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,503
>> All right.
>> But I'm going to show you

348
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,921
what I want you to take.
>> Okay.

349
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,507
>> Okay?
>> I'm with you, brother.

350
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,219
We have about this much rice
left, and that's it, so I'm

351
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,347
going to take a bag of rice.
>> How much rice do you guys

352
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,848
have at your place?
I never even looked.

353
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,517
You got about this much?
>> Probably half.

354
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,687
>> You got about half of this?
>> Yeah.

355
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,189
Honestly.
>> I know.

356
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,858
You can say, "This is good."
You can say, "Give me more."

357
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,361
You can say, "Give me that."
>> I can take that whole thing?

358
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,530
>> Yeah.
Of course, I'll kill you...

359
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:27,911
>> I wouldn't do that.
You know I wouldn't do that.

360
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,371
>> Right.
Do you want me to pour you a

361
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,999
little more rice in here?
I will.

362
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,502
I poured two more bowls full of
rice in his bag, and he was

363
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:39,381
happy.
That truly was not a looting.

364
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,051
That was friends helping
friends.

365
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,553
>> All right, you guys, I got to
go.

366
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,722
>> Okay.
>> Thanks so much.

367
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,682
>> Tell everybody hey.
>> Yeah.

368
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,560
>> There is probably a lot of
danger in being too much in

369
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:57,733
control of both tribes.
Who knows what my own tribe even

370
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,528
thinks of me, but if I push too
hard, I will end up alienating

371
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:06,033
someone.
>> Thanks, guys, so much.

372
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,243
>> See you later.
>> Okay, see you later.

373
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,911
>> Good luck.
Tell everybody we said hi.

374
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,539
>> All right.
I think this speaks volumes on

375
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,959
diplomacy, and, uh, there'll
be no hard feelings, because

376
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,463
I'm hoping, ultimately, in the
next handful of days, to be

377
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:33,060
part of their tribe.
>> Got to love the sea mail,

378
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:37,230
huh?
Uh-oh.

379
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:41,943
We got something.
All right, here it comes.

380
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,737
"The ocean yields you lots of
treats.

381
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,573
Some pay a fortune for what
you guys eat.

382
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:50,327
So prepare yourself for a
seafood feast.

383
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,790
Down it all and earn three more
days at least."

384
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,001
We eating, folks!
>> It looks like, for this

385
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,129
immunity challenge, they're
going to blender up all kinds

386
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,131
of crazy stuff from the ocean,
and we're going to have to

387
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,092
drink it.
This is going to be my toughest

388
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,095
challenge, because I'm just
not good at that kind of stuff.

389
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,554
>> Hold your nose, and...
>> Right.

390
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:15,018
>> Don't breathe and don't stop.
>> That's really true.

391
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,521
I don't really have too many
problems with eating disgusting

392
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,523
things.
Actually, I don't really have

393
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,483
a problem at all.
>> Hey, who's the least likely

394
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,694
for them to think they eat?
>> If someone has to go twice,

395
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,531
Michelle seems pretty darn
prepared.

396
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,492
Just have her act like it's the
worst thing in the world versus

397
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,495
Trish so they pick her instead
of Trish.

398
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:38,333
>> So, my plan for the challenge
is to play it up and act like

399
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,669
I really hate it and just, you
know, try to be all girly-girl

400
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:45,173
about it.
>> What we're thinking is the

401
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,509
other tribe is going to have
to pick one person to drink

402
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,179
twice, so we're going to
make her be a decoy for all of

403
00:23:51,263 --> 00:24:03,525
us.
>> He needs bandaging.

404
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:08,405
He's hurt.
>> Bring him to the challenge.

405
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:18,081
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.
What's going on, Drake?

406
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,375
>> Morning.
>> PROBST: What's going on,

407
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,085
Morgan?
Rupert, who is the new tribe

408
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,088
member?
>> This is Balboa.

409
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,216
I found him in the ocean just
barely hanging on.

410
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,759
So we bandaged him up, and
we're going to keep him as our

411
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,554
mascot.
>> Balboa.

412
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,056
>> PROBST: All right, let's get
to today's immunity challenge.

413
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,562
First things first.
Thank you, Savage.

414
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,024
Immunity back up for grabs.
Welcome to the Survivor smoothie

415
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:49,029
bar.
>> Oh.

416
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,573
>> Awesome.
(laughing)

417
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,284
>> Oh, my God.
>> PROBST: The spinning wheel

418
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,579
has been divided into 12
sections.

419
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,289
Each section represents an
ingredient that we will use

420
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,042
in our smoothies.
We have sardines, red shellfish,

421
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,921
mango, octopus, razor clams,
rock oysters, squid, conch,

422
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:10,759
coconut juice, sea water,
bleeding clam and my favorite,

423
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:15,222
Jeff's special, where I get to
mix up a little something for

424
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,932
you guys.
>> Somethin', somethin'.

425
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,558
>> PROBST: One at a time, tribe
members will come up.

426
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,061
I'll spin the wheel.
You will each roll a ball.

427
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,563
They will land on two different
ingredients.

428
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,066
We'll mix those ingredients.
You'll slug it down.

429
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,610
It's not a race.
You just need to get it down.

430
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,112
Morgan, because you are two
members shy, first person and

431
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:36,910
the second person will have to
drink two times.

432
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,454
First two: Savage, Sandra, come
on up.

433
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:43,250
(cheering)
Spot right here.

434
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:52,175
Roll 'em.
Sardine and bleeding clam.

435
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:57,180
All right.
Bleeding clam.

436
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,599
Mm.
>> That's disgusting.

437
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:04,688
>> We like clams.
We like clams.

438
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,982
>> PROBST: Boy, I can smell
that.

439
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:11,236
>> I'm ready.
>> PROBST: Three, two, one, go.

440
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,826
>> Oh, God!
>> Go, Andrew!

441
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,160
PROBST: That'll do.
>> You got it, girl.

442
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,620
Keep it going now.
Keep it going.

443
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,955
>> Nasty.
>> You can do it.

444
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,331
You can do it.
>> You'll be stronger after

445
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,791
this.
>> I'm going to be sick after

446
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,167
this.
>> PROBST: That a way, Sandra,

447
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,336
keep going.
(clapping and cheering)

448
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,298
>> Yeah!
>> Oh, that was hell.

449
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,674
>> Great!
>> PROBST: Both tribes score.

450
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,342
Have a seat.
>> We love you!

451
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,469
>> PROBST: Michelle, Ryno, come
on up.

452
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,847
>> Michelle's looking the least
forward to this out of every

453
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,682
one of us.
>> PROBST: Michelle and Ryno,

454
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:45,729
roll them!
What do we have?

455
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,355
Oh, Jeff's special.
>> Oh.

456
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,024
>> PROBST: Razor clam and Jeff's
special.

457
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,027
>> Oh, my God.
>> PROBST: Jeff's special means

458
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,529
I can pretty much put whatever I
want in here.

459
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,991
And I'm feeling colorful today.
>> Oh, no.

460
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,367
>> PROBST: Razor clams are
first.

461
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,161
>> I've never had a clam
before.

462
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,954
>> PROBST: I am loving the
octopus.

463
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,041
>> Oh!
>> We love octopus.

464
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,377
Extra tentacles.
>> That's humongous.

465
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,005
>> PROBST: That's, uh, that's
eight arms coming out of his

466
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,631
head is what that is.
>> Sick.

467
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,217
>> PROBST: I'll tell you, red
shellfish is really good.

468
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,969
>> Oh!
Sick.

469
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,388
>> One hell of a smell.
>> PROBST: Wait till you taste

470
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,182
it.
>> The Oreo cookie shake.

471
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,392
That's what that is.
>> Ew.

472
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,894
>> PROBST: One Jeff's special
coming up.

473
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,688
>> All right, Michelle.
>> PROBST: Three, two, one, go!

474
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,608
>> Michelle, go, girl, go!
>> Yeah, Ryno!

475
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,360
>> Go Ryno!
>> Let's go, Michelle.

476
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,111
You got it.
>> PROBST: Michelle having no

477
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,572
problem.
>> Yeah, girl!

478
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,574
>> Yeah!
Drink it, baby!

479
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:44,412
(clapping and cheering)
>> Kicked my ass.

480
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,248
>> PROBST: That'll work.
>> Good job, Ryno, good job.

481
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,793
>> PROBST: Nicely done.
>> All right, Michelle!

482
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,753
>> PROBST: Morgan scores, Drake
scores.

483
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,255
We're two-two.
(Michelle burps)

484
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,093
(laughing)
Next two, Jon, Darrah.

485
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,928
Jon, let me ask you a question.
What is this about?

486
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,262
This is...
this is...

487
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,764
that's-that's Jonny Fairplay
right there.

488
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,225
That's the "F." That's the "Y."
I'm all in between.

489
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,102
Jonny Fairplay.
I play fair.

490
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,937
No-no cheating.
>> PROBST: All right.

491
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,817
Here we go.
Roll them!

492
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,152
Conch and coconut juice.
>> Hey, actually, we might eat

493
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,696
some funky stuff, so if you want
to kiss before, that's cool.

494
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,949
>> No, I think I'll pass.
>> All right.

495
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,992
>> PROBST: What are the odds, if
you didn't have a boyfriend,

496
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,662
what chance would he have?
>> Nothing.

497
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,874
(laughing)
No offense.

498
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:34,462
>> No offense, but none.
>> To you, baby.

499
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,589
>> All right, drink it up,
Jon.

500
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,176
Yeah!
Whoo!

501
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,262
>> PROBST: Jon's good.
Darrah, taking her time, no

502
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,431
rush.
>> Thinking of me?

503
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:49,060
Don't go...
(mock-retching)

504
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,979
(Rupert laughs)
>> PROBST: Nice job.

505
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,480
We are even.
Three-three.

506
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,315
>> Very good!
>> PROBST: Next two.

507
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,486
Christa, Osten.
Roll it!

508
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:12,792
Squid and rock oyster.
>> Blah!

509
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:19,299
(laughing)
>> PROBST: Nicely done, you

510
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,885
freak.
Next two.

511
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:27,849
Trish, T.
Roll 'em.

512
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,518
Jeff's special and a little
squid.

513
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:37,025
>> Ooh, goodie!
>> PROBST: Drink.

514
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,821
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah!
>> PROBST: Fighting through it.

515
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,867
>> Yes!
We are even, five-five.

516
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,370
Shawn and Savage, you're
going again now.

517
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,749
Jeff's special and red
shellfish.

518
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:57,712
>> You got it.
>> PROBST: Nicely done.

519
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,839
Nicely done.
We're at six-six.

520
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,758
Ryno, you're up again for
Morgan.

521
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,259
And the big man.
>> Yay, I get to eat.

522
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,888
>> PROBST: Sardines and rock
oyster.

523
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:11,351
Cheers.
That'll work.

524
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,062
We're tied at seven-seven.
We're now going into a

525
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,023
tiebreaker round.
This will be a timed trial.

526
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,859
That is, the first person to
finish their drink wins

527
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,111
immunity for their tribe.
Drake, who's it going to be for

528
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,613
Morgan?
>> Darrah.

529
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,324
>> Yeah, Darrah.
>> PROBST: Darrah, come on down.

530
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,327
Morgan, who's it going to be
from Drake?

531
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,912
>> Sandra.
>> PROBST: Sandra.

532
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,373
>> You can do it, baby.
>> You can do it.

533
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,750
>> PROBST: First ingredient,
conch.

534
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,961
>> Lord help me.
>> PROBST: Little bit of rock

535
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,588
oyster.
Need a little bleeding clam.

536
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:45,301
I want a hit of squid.
>> No!

537
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,429
>> PROBST: Sea water.
>> Aw, that's going to be

538
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:53,393
terrible.
>> PROBST: Now for the garnish,

539
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:57,480
which you must eat.
First person who gets it down

540
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,816
wins.
Here's what's at stake:

541
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,902
immunity, three more days out
here.

542
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,445
For the losing tribe, you're
going to Tribal Council

543
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,073
tonight.
Somebody going home.

544
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,118
Three, two, one, go!
>> You can do it!

545
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,412
You can do it!
>> Come on, Darrah.

546
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:16,332
>> You can do it, Sandra!
>> All right, Darrah.

547
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,585
>> PROBST: Keep going, Darrah,
get it down.

548
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,753
Swallow.
That's it.

549
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,255
>> You got it, Sandra.
This is cake.

550
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,923
>> Come on, just throw it down
as fast as you can.

551
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,758
>> PROBST: That a way, guys,
you're doing great.

552
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,846
Gulp it, Darrah.
Gulp it down.

553
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,849
That a way, Sandra.
That a way to fight.

554
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:37,979
Darrah, moving on to the
sardine.

555
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,356
Get it down, get it down.
It's a race.

556
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,319
Get it down, Sandra.
Let's go, Darrah.

557
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,488
Both women trying to get the
sardines down, scales and all.

558
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,617
Sandra's came back up.
Twice it's come back up.

559
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,453
Keep catching it, Sandra.
You're still alive.

560
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,663
>> Swallow that bad boy!
>> Swallow the other piece!

561
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,000
Hurry up!
(excited shouting)

562
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,003
>> PROBST: Swallow!
Show me.

563
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,631
>> Turn to Jeff!
>> PROBST: Let me see it.

564
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,049
Morgan!
Good!

565
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,676
(cheering)
Immunity!

566
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,680
(cheering)
Morgan takes immunity back home

567
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:17,685
again.
Safe from the vote tonight.

568
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,481
Three more days on the island.
Great effort by Drake.

569
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,524
Not enough.
Somebody going home tonight.

570
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,652
You guys have this afternoon
to think about it.

571
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:35,703
I'll see you at Tribal Council.
>> I just hate that it's my

572
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:43,628
I'll see you at Tribal Council.
>> I just hate that it's my

573
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,088
fault we're going to go to
Tribal Council tonight.

574
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,882
>> You did beautiful.
>> I am so worried because I

575
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,718
feel like it's my fault that we
lost the immunity challenge.

576
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,720
I just couldn't get the
sardine down.

577
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,723
Why did they have to pick me?
>> I don't know, man.

578
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,060
I should have played it up more.
>> And so, I feel when we go

579
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,354
to Tribal Council tonight that,
why shouldn't I be the one going

580
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:05,525
home if this is all my fault?
Nobody wants to be the cause of

581
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,236
the tribe going to Tribal
Council.

582
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,904
>> Dude, it doesn't matter.
It's okay.

583
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:12,615
I mean, you did your best.
That's all you can do, right?

584
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,951
>> All of that is easy to say
when you're not on the chopping

585
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:18,663
block.
Lord have mercy.

586
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,916
>> I'm pissed the ... off.
That was the easiest...

587
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,793
challenge we, easiest
challenge we'll have the

588
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,088
entire ... game.
I feel like the last immunity

589
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:32,051
challenge was mind over matter.
Obviously, a sardine is bigger

590
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,930
than Sandra's mind.
Secondly, I'm extremely pissed

591
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:39,308
off at Michelle.
Michelle was planning on

592
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,229
pretending as though she would
be the worst in the bunch when

593
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,982
in reality she was technically
the best.

594
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,443
>> I almost fell off my chair
when she chugged that thing.

595
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,404
The plan was she was supposed to
gag that down.

596
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:55,616
>> But her freakin' ego wouldn't
let her do it, and, uh... that's

597
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,872
what I feel about her ego right
now.

598
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,458
>> You and I know about these
physical challenges.

599
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,960
You know what I mean?
>> Yep.

600
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:08,254
>> Michelle can run.
>> I know.

601
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,089
But this isn't the time right
now to talk about it.

602
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,632
>> I know, but you know what I'm
saying.

603
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,427
>> I know.
>> I'm thinking about winning.

604
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,805
We need to.
>> We're back two damn minutes,

605
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,807
and he's already trying to get
somebody out.

606
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:24,562
He better watch out, or it'll
be him.

607
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,982
>> What are you thinking about?
(grunts)

608
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:31,611
I know majority goes me.
I'm-I'm just having big

609
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:35,823
problems.
It just, it bothers me that...

610
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:40,328
we have maybe one more challenge
before the merge, and Shawn,

611
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:47,251
who is, you know, just...
I can't trust him further than

612
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,380
I could throw him.
>> You know, they say that he

613
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,007
did something when I'm gone.
But when I'm here, he does

614
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,801
nothing, and he eats more than
anybody.

615
00:34:54,884 --> 00:35:03,142
He does nothing.
(gagging)

616
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,859
What could we say to convince
people to vote for Shawn and

617
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,529
convince them that we don't need
the damn strength of Shawn

618
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,656
'cause he's not that strong
anyway?

619
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:22,203
(coughing)
>> There's, like, one more

620
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:29,001
challenge.
>> Michelle feels like she is

621
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:34,090
going.
She is trying to make a plea

622
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:38,761
that she works as hard, if not
harder, than Shawn, and she

623
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,222
eats lots less.
She never takes more than her

624
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,891
share.
>> My point is that once the

625
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,352
merge comes, which will happen
really soon...

626
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,062
>> I know.
>> ...it just doesn't seem to

627
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:52,108
make sense to me that people
would want him around at the

628
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:56,404
merge rather than myself.
>> She swayed me enough that I

629
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,031
will mention it to others.
Do we want to take Shawn out of

630
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,409
this game?
It's day 15-- he was our first

631
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:11,460
pick on day two.
>> PROBST: What a difference a

632
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:25,600
pick on day two.
>> PROBST: What a difference a

633
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,477
few days can make.
In the last four days, you've

634
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,230
lost three challenges and, by
the end of the night, two

635
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,817
members.
Sandra... you got selected to be

636
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:39,614
in the tiebreaker.
Gave it a great effort.

637
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,283
It wasn't enough.
Are you worried that it might

638
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,828
be you tonight?
>> If it's me, I know why.

639
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,624
Then I'll deal with it.
I'm just sorry.

640
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,752
That's all I can say.
>> PROBST: Is this tribe

641
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,295
starting to splinter a little
bit?

642
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,297
Is that a fair assessment,
losing this many challenges

643
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,090
in a row?
>> No.

644
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,635
We-we didn't expect to lose this
challenge here.

645
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,804
And I've apologized to the tribe
a couple of times today because

646
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,973
of the fact that I didn't pull
through it.

647
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,434
We didn't even plan to lose this
challenge but, you know, things

648
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,437
happen.
>> PROBST: Let's talk about the

649
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,481
challenges since we-we jumped to
that.

650
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,316
Let's go back to the last
reward challenge.

651
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,985
From where I'm looking at it,
Jon, you didn't know if you had

652
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,613
a rudder or a paddle or what to
do with it.

653
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,324
Was that discussed among the
tribe, or was that just an

654
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,327
observation I saw?
>> Uh, the last reward challenge

655
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,665
was the first challenge of all
the challenges that we actually

656
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,001
lost, as far as, uh, we saw
it.

657
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,963
>> PROBST: Okay, what do you
mean, "as far as we saw it"?

658
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,839
'Cause, we went through this
charade last time.

659
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,677
>> Well, last time, we felt, uh,
that no one really needed to

660
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,513
know until it was time to be
told, uh, what was really

661
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,848
going on.
>> PROBST: So now that you've

662
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,850
lost three in a row, you want to
come clean and say, "Well, we

663
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,978
actually didn't lose the first
one, we threw it."

664
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,814
>> Yeah, absolutely.
>> PROBST: My point is, throwing

665
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:58,359
a challenge in a game like this
is really cocky.

666
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:02,196
Michelle, is there a part of you
that, looking back now, says,

667
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,532
"You know, by throwing a
challenge, we gave them the

668
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,993
ability to believe in
themselves.

669
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,370
Now we're the ones scrambling
to get back, and they are the

670
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:14,125
powerhouse in their mind"?
>> Uh, that's a load of crap.

671
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,545
Um, I don't think that how much
they built up themselves for

672
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,880
winning that one challenge and
then continuing for two after

673
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,384
that is enough to keep on
winning.

674
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,678
Um, I don't expect that Drake
will have to lose to Morgan

675
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,889
again.
>> When they decided to throw

676
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,560
that damn challenge, I knew it
was the worst mistake in the

677
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,981
world, but I could not convince
them.

678
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:40,109
If we would not have thrown that
challenge, we would have not

679
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,111
lost the immunity.
We would have not lost the

680
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,530
rewards.
I would have not had to go to

681
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,741
Morgan.
The one good thing about going

682
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:52,580
to Morgan, I learned a lot
about them.

683
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,709
If I can take what I learned
and use it against them, then

684
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,754
maybe, you know, we got some
good out of it.

685
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,631
>> PROBST: Fair enough.
It is time to vote.

686
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:06,844
Shawn.
You're up.

687
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:21,400
>> If anybody was going to jump
ship, buddy, I think it's you.

688
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:31,452
Hope you don't.
>> You're a good girl, but say

689
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:45,132
Hope you don't.
>> You're a good girl, but say

690
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:59,814
hello to the bad guy.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

691
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,816
votes.
(man singing in foreign

692
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:15,329
language)
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

693
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,706
read, the decision is final.
Person voted out will be asked

694
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,625
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

695
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:25,881
I'll read the votes.
First vote...

696
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:35,349
Michelle.
Shawn.

697
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,397
Michelle.
That's two votes Michelle.

698
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:48,320
Michelle.
That's three.

699
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,659
Second person voted out of the
Drake Tribe:

700
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,036
Michelle.
That's four votes.

701
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,706
That's enough.
Last two votes will remain a

702
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:08,799
mystery.
Michelle, the tribe has spoken.

703
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:24,398
It's time for you to go.
Grab your torches, head back to

704
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:27,443
camp.
Good night.

705
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,247
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

706
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,002
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i>

707
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,754
The Morgan Tribe has an
unexpected visitor.

708
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,964
(screaming)
>> I don't like animals.

709
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,883
I've been bit by a couple
animals.

710
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,093
(squawking)
>> PROBST: And at Drake, tempers

711
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,512
fly.
>> No, what's ... ridiculous is

712
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,767
not doing anything!
>> Jon, just shut up, all right!

713
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:05,105
>> Maybe Shawn should get a
clue, or he's going home.

714
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:12,279
>> I'm really upset that I came
all this way, but it didn't

715
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,323
happen.
I think I have learned stuff

716
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,659
about myself.
When things suck, and you're in

717
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,453
crappy situations and being able
to carry through it.

718
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:21,288
And I learned how much I can
deal with.

719
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,958
But regardless of all the
politics, wish I could have been

720
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,794
here longer-- just had more time
to kick some butt and really

721
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,963
get into the game.
