JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor:

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>When an Amazon rainstorm</i>
<i>blew in,</i>

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,756
<i>Tambaqui took cover...</i>

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,133
It sucks to be
outside right now.

5
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,259
PROBST:<i> ...while</i>
<i>Jaburu's pitiful shelter</i>

6
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,428
<i>left the women out in the cold.</i>

7
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:15,598
I can't believe
how badly this sucks.

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,307
PROBST:<i> At the reward</i>
<i>challenge, the women</i>

9
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,268
<i>won some much-needed fish bait.</i>

10
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,188
Jaburu wins
their second challenge in a row.

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>Back at Tambaqui,</i>
<i>the men licked their wounds.</i>

12
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,233
DAVE:
<i>Everybody wants to win.</i>

13
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,277
<i>Particularly seven guys</i>

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,446
don't want to lose
to a bunch of girls.

15
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,447
PROBST:
<i>And at Jaburu,</i>

16
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,948
<i>the discovery of a granola bar</i>

17
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,116
<i>put Janet in hot water.</i>

18
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,119
JOANNA:<i> Jeanne saw</i>
<i>the little candy bar thing</i>

19
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,454
inside of Janet's bag.

20
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,955
JANET: If you're gonna
vote me off, that's fine,

21
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,123
as long as it's not
for that reason,

22
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,666
because if it is,
you're making a mistake.

23
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,751
PROBST:
Jaburu, no score.

24
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,836
The contest is over.

25
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,212
Tambaqui-- immunity.

26
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,922
-(cheering)
<i>-At the immunity challenge,</i>

27
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,299
<i>the men finally tasted victory,</i>

28
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,302
<i>sending the Jaburu women</i>
<i>to their first Tribal Council,</i>

29
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,306
<i>where Janet was the second</i>
<i>person voted out of the Amazon.</i>

30
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>14 are left.</i>

31
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

32
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,255
(thunder cracks, rumbles)

33
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,257
And on the seventh day,
the Lord said to rest,

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,260
but that's not us.

35
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,353
Come on, baby.

36
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,397
That hurt.

37
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,400
ROB:<i> We had a bad rainstorm</i>
<i>yesterday, and we had</i>

38
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,571
<i>a lot of leaks,</i>
<i>and everybody was getting wet,</i>

39
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,907
<i>and we decided to fix up</i>
<i>our roof today.</i>

40
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,743
I can't imagine
that the girls have a shelter

41
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,579
that is comparable to ours.

42
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,538
<i>Uh, maybe it's more comfortable</i>
<i>than ours,</i>

43
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,583
<i>but we're men,</i>
<i>and we just build,</i>

44
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,543
<i>and we think</i>
<i>about comfort later.</i>

45
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,962
<i>Where we want to build</i>
<i>an awesome structure,</i>

46
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,214
something big to look at,
that's what we do.

47
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:53,423
We're the men.

48
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,388
Oh, Danny, can you get us
some water?

49
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,808
Sure.

50
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,935
Can you handle it
by yourself or not?

51
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,270
Yeah.

52
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,606
Okay, when you carry it back,
put it on your shoulder.

53
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,441
Are you going
to go with me or what?

54
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,317
Well, I was going
to go do it myself...

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,318
I don't, I don't...

56
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,322
I think if you...

57
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,365
I'll go do it.

58
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,998
(thunder cracks)

59
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,848
ROGER:
<i>Picked up the deal,</i>

60
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,642
<i>went down myself,</i>
<i>and I told him...</i>

61
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,809
<i>Look at him.</i>

62
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,852
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>He's a little Hercules.</i>

63
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,355
If I can go down and pick up
a five-gallon deal,

64
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,522
put it on my shoulders,
and carry it back up...

65
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,483
<i>And I real...</i>
<i>It really got me hot.</i>

66
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,153
<i>I, um... I had to...</i>

67
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,238
I'm tempted to slap the kid
around, to be honest with you.

68
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,163
DANIEL:<i> The-the thing</i>
<i>that irritates me about Roger</i>

69
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,165
<i>is that he just barks orders</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

70
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:09,832
I mean, he's not
very friendly about it.

71
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,293
He just tells people what to do.

72
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,504
<i>Uh, I'm not really speaking</i>
<i>to Roger right now.</i>

73
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,964
<i>Um, he knows that he wants</i>

74
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,675
<i>to vote for me, and I know</i>
<i>I want to vote for him.</i>

75
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,343
<i>And also, he smells bad.</i>

76
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,346
He smells
like really spoiled vinegar?

77
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,307
Almost...
Almost had it out with him.

78
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,308
DAVE:
Which one?

79
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,393
Dan. Lazy...

80
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:32,313
<i>It really pissed me off.</i>

81
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,272
<i>Almost to the point</i>

82
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,192
that I was ready
to give him a kung fu chop.

83
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,860
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

84
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,696
But I'm relaxing.

85
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,990
I'm relaxing.

86
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:42,991
MATTHEW:
<i>It'll be cool.</i>

87
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,701
<i>I think what you should do--</i>

88
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,412
don't let this situation
get you down.

89
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,039
Don't get bummed out about it,
even though it's... it's...

90
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,667
There's a lot of, uh,
bull going on,

91
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,043
you know, people still

92
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,839
jockeying for position
and currying favor.

93
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,675
Right now, there's still
momentum to boot Roger.

94
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,051
He's still the prime candidate.

95
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,054
(Matthew speaking Mandarin)

96
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,106
MATTHEW:<i> Daniel and I</i>
<i>came together because</i>

97
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,815
<i>he speaks Mandarin</i>
<i>and Cantonese;</i>

98
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,735
<i>I was born in Hong Kong;</i>

99
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,652
<i>I speak some Mandarin,</i>

100
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,405
and we started to speak
Mandarin together,

101
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,073
and there was
an immediate connection.

102
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,498
Physically or what?

103
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,635
-Oh.
-Secure.

104
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,181
DANIEL:<i> Matthew and I</i>
<i>are great friends.</i>

105
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,140
<i>He's my best friend out here,</i>

106
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,933
<i>and he's a really good ally.</i>

107
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,977
When he tells you something,
he's being truthful,

108
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,020
whereas the other guys
around here--

109
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,272
when they tell you something,
you have no idea

110
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,607
if they're telling the truth
or if they're lying.

111
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,406
Mm-hmm.

112
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,784
All right, dude, let's go back

113
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,661
to the, uh, the rat pack.

114
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,292
(squawking)

115
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,879
(insects buzzing)

116
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,805
JEANNE:
<i>This is day seven,</i>

117
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,599
<i>and our tribe is</i>
<i>pretty much pathetic.</i>

118
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,310
Definitely the hygiene
of the camp right now--

119
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,812
that's, uh, lacking.

120
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,313
(buzzing)

121
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,815
<i>I thought they cleaned the pot,</i>
<i>but they didn't</i>

122
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,483
<i>clean it out thoroughly,</i>
<i>and there's wasps</i>

123
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,485
<i>all over the camp this morning.</i>

124
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,445
Yeah, I'm actually
allergic to bees,

125
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,031
so that's why I want to try
to trap them in there.

126
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,075
(buzzing)

127
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,954
(soft groaning)

128
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,040
That's what attracted
all those noises last night.

129
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,625
-Tarantula.
-Can I see?

130
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,502
DEENA:
Holy crappy-oli.

131
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,754
-(chopping in distance)
-Give me the knife.

132
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,839
JENNA:
What's with our food?

133
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,673
They always want our food.

134
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,346
-Jeanne!
-(laughter)

135
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,347
Sorry.

136
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,558
Spider's dead.

137
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,560
Oh, that's lovely.

138
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,020
That would be the nice,
fresh smell of mold.

139
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,399
That needs to come out,
that moldy stuff.

140
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,822
What are we doing?

141
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,700
The four of us here--
do we have a plan?

142
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,121
We need wood,
and we need fire going.

143
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,042
JEANNE:
<i>We've been spinning our wheels.</i>

144
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,587
<i>You can't spin your wheels</i>
<i>in the jungle.</i>

145
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,380
Everyone has their own agenda.

146
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:44,881
My priority is water.

147
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,092
See? We have none.

148
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,511
My agenda is food.

149
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,805
And then whatever else
we have to do-- I have no idea.

150
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,891
I'm so hungry,
I can't even think straight.

151
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,350
We've got girls
who are freezing at night.

152
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,561
They don't have any shoes
on their feet,

153
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,521
and there's no fire
near the shelter,

154
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,564
and the shelter over there
is not big enough.

155
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,692
JEANNE:
<i>We got one, two, three, four,</i>

156
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,737
five different kind of things
going on here.

157
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,072
<i>We promised each other</i>
<i>as a tribe, last night,</i>

158
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,741
that we were going to have
a meeting to get our...

159
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,868
things in order.

160
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,788
We all have to call this meeting
in order now.

161
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,628
Shawna, can you make it
to a meeting?

162
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,795
Shawna?

163
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,923
She's sleeping.

164
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,757
-She's out.
-Well, she's part of the tribe.

165
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,926
I'm gonna wake her up.

166
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,718
Hey...

167
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,802
we need to have a meeting.

168
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,929
Can you take a...

169
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:37,725
-SHAWNA: Yeah. -Okay.
We're going to go over there.

170
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,727
The meeting is called to order.

171
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,565
So I think we should, uh, maybe

172
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,816
initiate a leader.

173
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,945
I, um, initiate Deena.

174
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,906
-Anybody...?
-Second that? Okay.

175
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,201
JEANNE:<i> Strategically,</i>
<i>Joanna and I decided to put</i>

176
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,412
Deena up for
the leadership position because

177
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,956
<i>we think she's</i>
<i>a little hotheaded,</i>

178
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,624
<i>and I think she's going</i>
<i>to create a little friction.</i>

179
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,962
Deena, do you accept the offer?

180
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,172
You know, I'm going to...

181
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,466
All I want to do is--
we delegate the tasks

182
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,593
-that are important for the day.
-SHAWNA: We don't need a leader.

183
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,761
We need a delegator. We need
someone who's gonna step in

184
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,097
-and give us some structure.
-"Okay, hey, you do that,

185
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,807
-you do that"?
-DEENA:<i> Nobody wants to step up</i>

186
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,141
<i>to be leader, because that puts</i>

187
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,643
a big target on your body,

188
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,312
and who wants to get voted
out of the game?

189
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,105
<i>I didn't take that</i>
<i>with open arms,</i>

190
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,232
<i>but, yes, I am going to do it.</i>

191
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,316
<i>I am going to delegate tasks.</i>

192
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,985
<i>I told them</i>
<i>that that was my goal.</i>

193
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,987
Okay,
we're a little bit raggedy.

194
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,947
-We're okay. -HEIDI: You know
what's impressive,

195
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,699
is that we live like this,

196
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,325
and we've won
two out of three things.

197
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,326
-(laughter)
-I mean, really.

198
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,995
<i>This group is</i>
<i>such a good group.</i>

199
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,248
<i>When it, when it comes time</i>
<i>to pull your butt together</i>

200
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,457
and say, hey, what...

201
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,502
here's the organization we need
for... to win this thing,

202
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>we are such a good group</i>
<i>together.</i>

203
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,338
(indistinct talking)

204
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,631
<i>Jaburu is beating Tambaqui,</i>

205
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,799
<i>but, more importantly,</i>
<i>it is the battle of the sexes.</i>

206
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,759
<i>I mean, totally,</i>

207
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,345
all the way,
this is the battle of the sexes,

208
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,472
and the women really are kicking
the men's butts.

209
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,599
ALL:
Jaburu, Jaburu, Jaburu rocks!

210
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,986
PROBST: Tambaqui,
getting your first look

211
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,696
at the new Jaburu,
missing one member.

212
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,198
We're now even up: seven, seven.

213
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,327
Okay, today's challenge
is for reward.

214
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,286
It will test your ability

215
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,747
to keep track
of a large number of items.

216
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,791
There are 35 matching pairs
of items.

217
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,754
Each of you will have a box
with five items inside it.

218
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,881
One by one, you'll ask somebody
from either tribe if they have

219
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,799
a certain item in their box.
If there's a match,

220
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,760
you collect the items.

221
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,764
Every time you get a pair, you
score a point for your tribe.

222
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,184
The tribe who collects the most
matching pairs wins reward.

223
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,393
Want to know
what you're playing for?

224
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,811
Yeah!

225
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,188
We have, uh, baskets.

226
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,397
(happy sighs)

227
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,234
We got some shampoos,
deodorant, some soap.

228
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,570
There's nail clippers--
lots of different items--

229
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,238
toothpaste, toothbrush;

230
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,408
all designed to keep you
looking and smelling good.

231
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,577
Worth playing for?
Good.

232
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,205
Take a spot behind a box,
wait for my go.

233
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,586
Okay, you've drawn straws
to determine the order.

234
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:11,754
We start with you, Joanna.

235
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,797
What's his name?

236
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,382
-My name is Dave.
-Dave.

237
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,800

238
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,594
No, I don't.

239
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,096
-Sorry. -PROBST: No score

00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,766

241
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,227
-Yes, I do. -PROBST: We got
a score for Tambaqui.

242
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,269

He'll come get it.

244
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,108
I don't think he's got any
problem coming over to get it

245
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,317
-from you.
-Hey, how are you doing?

246
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,402

-I'm Shawna.
-See you. All right.

249
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,114
Hoping to see
each other soon, okay?

250
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,573
No doubt.
I'm planning on it.

251
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,866
You hope you're in the game
that long, brother.

252

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,085
Joanna, do you have shampoo?

257
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,297
Yeah, all right.

258
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,299

Don't.

00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,307
Unfortunately, no, I don't.

264
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,308

00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,458
really smart

I would, uh,
I would let you know,

285
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,970
but I just--
I did pick it up somewhere.

286

No idea--
I was just paying attention.

I don't have conditioner;
somebody took it earlier.

346
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,626
-Really?
-Yeah.

347
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,752
(groans)

348
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,795
And Heidi doesn't have it
either.

349
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:40,588
-(laughs)
-SHAWNA: Okay, good to know.

350
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,298
PROBST:
Hey, Rob, before you ask,

351
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,008
does that usually work,
that sort of witty repartee?

352
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:48,137
Amazingly, Jeff, it doesn't.

353
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,764
No, no, no, you should hear what
we say about him in our camp.

354
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,765
It's all good.

355
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,933
Oh, really?

356
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,310
ALEX:
Yeah, Rob!

357
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,519
Nice, baby.

358
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,479
-The Rob-a-sue!
-Yeah, the Rob-a-sue!

359
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,024
Dear God, I hope
that there's a merger.

360
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,942
(laughter)

361
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:02,818
PROBST:
All right, Deena.

362
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,528
Rob, do you got
some soap, buddy?

363
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,530
(whooping)

364
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,783
PROBST:
Jaburu at 17,

365
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,785
Tambaqui is at 14.

366
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,495
Dave, you guys need to score.

367
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,496
We need to score.

368
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,832
(laughter)

369
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:20,544
Um, I'm gonna go with Christy

370
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,504
with shampoo.

371
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,505
Shampoo.

372
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,506
I'm sorry.

373
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,049
Ooh.

374
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,133
(applause)

375
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,302
I'm really sorry.

376
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,553
PROBST:
So here's where we're at.

377
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,138
Jaburu sitting on 17.

378
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,515
All they need is
one more to win.

379
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,516
Jeanne.

380
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,101
Dave, do you have shampoo?

381
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,103
-PROBST: That'll do it.
-(women cheering)

382
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,024
Nice job.

383
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,860
Jaburu wins reward.

384
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:45,694
Here it is, ladies.

385
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,613
I know how much
you want this stuff.

386
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,531
Come get it. Who wants it?
You got your tweezers,

387
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,076
you got your eyebrow pluckers,
you got toothpaste.

388
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,079
(cheering continues)

389
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,040
WOMEN:
Jaburu, Jaburu, Jaburu rocks!

390
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,876
Whoo!

391
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,838
PROBST: Nice job, you can head
on back the same way you came.

392
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,111
ROB:<i> So I'm very excited</i>
<i>that this is</i>

393
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,279
<i>the best day of my life.</i>

394
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,615
I got a better reward
than I could ever hope for

395
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,908
in soap and toothpaste--

396
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,285
that maybe some girls out there
in the other tribe

397
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,705
would want to get with me.

398
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,082
If I could do anything to help
Rob-a-sue and his dream...

399
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,417
I, I am telling you...

400
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,085
I have a dream.

401
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,920
I will give up my sleeping space

402
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:48,632
so Rob-a-sue can have
room for two.

403
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,551
-There you go.
-That's commitment right there.

404
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,137
ROB:<i> Since day one, Heidi</i>
<i>has always been my favorite,</i>

405
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,931
but she looks like she could
really use the conditioner

406
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:58,726
and maybe some of that,
some of that soap.

407
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,936
<i>She looks a little rugged</i>
<i>and beat down,</i>

408
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,063
<i>but, look, I'll take</i>
<i>what I can get.</i>

409
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,314
<i>She's probably a 9 1/2</i>

410
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:08,277
in real life and right about now
she's closing in on a six,

411
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,405
so that kind of levels the
playing field for a guy like me,

412
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,824
which is an exciting prospect.

413
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,451
I had a great time.
I finally got to meet Shawna

414
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,577
and I think she digs me.

415
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,203
I can tell by the little
twinkle in her eye

416
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,455
when I met her, you know.

417
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,457
ROGER: And the fun I had--
honestly, honestly, Alex--

418
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,584
was to see you guys
react with these women.

419
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,668
DANIEL: Overall,
they seemed pretty nice.

420
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,421
-ROB: With the exception
of Joanna. -Yeah.

421
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,465
I think she was showing
her true colors a little bit.

422
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,674
ROB:
<i>I don't like Joanna.</i>

423
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:35,471
She's always yelling about Jesus
and how Jesus loves Jaburu.

424
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,722
<i>I didn't know that Jesus had</i>

425
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,182
<i>a vested interest</i>
<i>in</i> Survivor<i> 'cause,</i>

426
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,350
as far as I've seen every
picture of him, Jesus is a guy.

427
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,145
I would think that
he would want the guys to win.

428
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,481
And Jenna has always had the
kind of dark, mysterious smile

429
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,483
out of the corner of her eye
and a little twinkle.

430
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,484
Who is Jenna?

431
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,485
Jenna is the one
who was standing

432
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,694
right next to me,
with the black hair.

433
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,987
-I know, I'm saying...
-Oh, who is she?

434
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,988
-philosophically.
-Who is she?

435
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:53,989
We don't know.

436
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,407
I think Jenna-- Jenna's, uh...

437
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,495
she turned and looked at me,
we had eye contact for a second.

438
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,664
She is-- she has an
engaging stare.

439
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,876
Jenna is the hot chick at the
bar who doesn't say anything,

440
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,753
who's got the eye
and looks around

441
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,338
-and waits for the guy...
-Waits for something to happen.

442
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,339
...and the thing is,

443
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,715
if you're not that guy,

444
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,424
she'll shoot you down
real quick.

445
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,469
Jenna is a gorgeous individual.

446
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,348
She has-- her butt is so sexy.

447
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,810
And Butch, the girls were
asking you more than once.

448
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,019
Yeah, Shawna and Jenna.

449
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,521
Shawna on the left,
Jenna on the right.

450
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,356
BUTCH:
<i>What I thought of Jenna was--</i>

451
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,692
I didn't consider like the
other guys as a, as a hottie.

452
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,401
I mean, I guess she is.

453
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,362
Um, you know, I'm 50 years old.

454
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,030
I'm not supposed to look
at things like that,

455
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,698
but of course
I'm not dead either.

456
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,742
I really cannot wait to watch

457
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,495
when the girls
are all taking baths.

458
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,330
"Heidi, do you need some help
with your bosom?"

459
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,916
"Oh, sure, Jenna."

460
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,876
(laughter)

461
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,137
DEENA:<i> I can't get the mud from</i>
<i>yesterday out of my shorts.</i>

462
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,891
JEANNE:
I just don't come clean.

463
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,018
DEENA:
I'm losing my hair.

464
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,271
My hair.

465
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,941
CHRISTY:<i> Bathing in general</i>
<i>in front of other people--</i>

466
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,234
<i>it's a very, um,</i>

467
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,777
self-conscious thing.

468
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,404
Anyone need the scrub brush?

469
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:20,742
CHRISTY:<i> When we were bathing,</i>
<i>I bathed with Jeanne and Deena.</i>

470
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,452
<i>And, of course,</i>

471
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,787
the girls my age...

472
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,081
Heidi, we have to go
before it gets dark.

473
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,207
<i>...are the ones that,</i>

474
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,333
that, of course,
I'm not invited.

475
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,293
(laughs)

476
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,419
And that's okay.

477
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,046
I've learned to accept that,

478
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,049
<i>and they can go off</i>
<i>and do their bathing thing</i>

479
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,509
<i>and wash and be pretty</i>

480
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,095
and check each other out.

481
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:43,432
Be like,
"Oh, do I have any dirty spots?"

482
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,564
SHAWNA:
Oh, this is so awesome.

483
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,608
HEIDI:<i> The cuter girls--</i>
<i>me and Jenna and Shawna--</i>

484
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,276
<i>kind of went off</i>

485
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,905
<i>from the older women because</i>
<i>we're younger and we're cuter;</i>

486
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,324
<i>we've got better bodies;</i>
<i>and, for some reason,</i>

487
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,618
that's like a huge issue
with older people.

488
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,452
JENNA:
Yes, we are masters of beauty.

489
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,787
(laughter)

490
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,539
HEIDI:<i> We're all very confident</i>

<i>we're all three having fun,</i>

492
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,793
<i>we don't have these older women</i>

493
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,087
<i>what we should</i>
<i>and shouldn't be doing.</i>

494
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,298
-I'm taking my top off.
-That's what I'm doing.

495
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,674
Oh.

496
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,262
(laughter)

497
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,306
-It does feel good, doesn't it?
-It feels like I was wearing

498
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,307
a sports bra for, like, years.

499
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,643
Ah... relief.

500
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,645
SHAWNA:<i> The three of us</i>
<i>were washing each other,</i>

501
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,771
<i>bathing topless</i>
<i>in the Amazon River.</i>

502
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,980
<i>It felt like a soap commercial</i>

503
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,317
<i>that went wrong,</i>
<i>and it felt so good</i>

504
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,860
to just be myself

505
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,781
and be partially naked
in an Amazon river.

506
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,407
I mean, we're in Brazil.

507
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,327
It's nice to get underneath
and all around.

508
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,037
HEIDI:
<i>If there's a merge,</i>

509
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,665
<i>it would definitely be to our</i>
<i>advantage to go topless because</i>

510
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,833
guys, it's all
they ever think about.

511
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,794
<i>I think that they would just,</i>
<i>like, have that on their brains</i>

512
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,836
<i>all the time,</i>
<i>instead of the game.</i>

513
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,338
<i>I think they'd be more like,</i>

514
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,174
<i>"I want to keep you on my team</i>
<i>as long as possible</i>

515

if I get to see that
all the time,"

516
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,844
<i>so if their mind is distracted,</i>

517
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,014
<i>then that just gives me a</i>
<i>chance to move one space ahead.</i>

518
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:16,858
DAVE:<i> It's hard for me to...</i>
<i>to be with these personalities.</i>

519
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,194
<i>I mean, these guys are--</i>
<i>they're intense.</i>

520
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:19,736
MATTHEW:
Let me ask you something.

521
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,947
Do you think that, uh...

522
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,824
Which situation would be better:

523
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:27,828
without Daniel or without Roger?

524
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,914
I believe that taking out Dan
would be better.

525
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:35,043
After that,
we'll see how it goes.

526
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,714
I think that you are
the best player on this tribe.

527
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,882
-Thank you, I appreciate it.
-I think that I am

528
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,011
-a very underestimated player...
-I think so, too.

529
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,470
...and I know that
I'm on the outside looking in.

530
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,848
Yeah, but that
doesn't have to be.

531
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,391
I would...

532
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,851
There's a, there's,
there's a certain someone

533
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,102
whose name's been brought up,

534
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,897
that if he went away, it would
change things very, very much.

535
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,232
-Roger?
-Mm.

536
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,734
I want to do it.

537
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,570
I mean, the person who makes
the most sense to eliminate

538
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,032
based on performance,
obviously, is Daniel.

539
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,578
But based on personalities
and other issues,

540
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,373
both Rob and Al have pushed me,
and mentioned Roger's name.

541
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,207
I said I wasn't gonna do it

542
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,167
unless it was gonna be
a done deal.

543
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,918
I'm not gonna be on
the losing side at all.

544
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,128
Matt alread--
Matt already came to me...

545
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,713
-And you want to do it?
-...and brought it up.

546
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,590
I don't really trust anybody.

547
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,758
-Dude.
-You know.

548
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,384
I mean, you won't tell
Alex this,

549
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,928
right, but, I mean,
I don't trust him.

550
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,930
I don't trust Alex at all.

551
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,599
What about Dave?

552
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,267
I think we leave Dave
out of it for right now.

553
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,478
That's-- I can't believe
that this is happening.

554
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,271
This is the best day of my life.

555
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,440
This is like a dream come true.

556
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,524
(laughter)

557
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,568
There's a fish.

558
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,445
Me being-- actually, I'll get
a great-- another worm.

559
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,697
What a stitch.

560
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,783
Dude, give me a potato.

561
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,576
-We'll hook that up.
-What the...?

562
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,954
Textbook, baby.

563
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,290
Leave him in the boat;
let's get another one.

564
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,961
Got some fish, guys.

565
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,463
-Monsters.
-All right.

566
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,672
Oh, yeah.

567
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,008
We're going to need
a bigger fire, man.

568
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,552
Ready, dude?

569
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,679
(laughter)

570
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,598
Cheapie soup.

571
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,517
What do you say-- six ounces?

572
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,268
BUTCH:
Not even.

573
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,645
DAVE:<i> You know,</i>
<i>for the past, past week or so,</i>

574
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,315
<i>the focus has been really</i>
<i>on surviving</i>

575
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,525
<i>and how we're going</i>
<i>to make it out here.</i>

576
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,026
<i>And talking to Matt</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

577
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,194
it really came.

578
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,153
You know, we're here
to play a game

579
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,323
and we're here to eliminate
15 other people.

580
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,324
ALEX:
You caught a fish?

581
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,784
-MATTHEW: Three.
-Three.

582
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,704
All right, look at that, baby.

583
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,833
Nice. Nice.

584
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,043
Um, and what was interesting in
talking to Matt this morning

585
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,503
was to hear him talk about how

586
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,715
<i>Alex has been talking to Rob</i>
<i>about getting rid of Roger,</i>

587
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,136
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>it kind of opened up my eyes.</i>

588
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:49,636
There's a lot more going on
behind the scenes

589
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,763
than I'm aware of.

590
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,975
Guys, we got the momentum now,
man... got the momentum.

591
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,352
ROB:
<i>David and Matthew</i>

592
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:01,815
went out on a fishing trip
and brought back three guppies.

593
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,025
<i>And Matthew is like,</i>
<i>"Oh, I'm going to make</i>

594
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,571
<i>"a fish bouillon soup,</i>
<i>and it's so, it's so depressing</i>

595
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,825
for a chef like myself
without these seasonings."

596
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,118
We're going to have
to wing it, guys.

597
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:17,372
I mean, no utensils,
no real service vessels.

598
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,582
It's going to be primitive.

599
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,126
We'll figure it out.

600
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,836
I think we can handle primitive.

601
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,837
<i>I was like: Matt,</i>

602
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,172
when I was in the fraternity,

603
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,507
I would swallow fish that were
bigger than this whole.

604
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,384
-How we doing, fellas?
-Did we get some flavor?

605
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,636
MATTHEW:
It's not a lot of flavor.

606
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,847
You guys, I mean,
I could put this broth

607
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,684
back on the fire and concentrate
it even more; it'd be better.

608
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,396
Right now, it's pretty light.

609
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,232
Kind of tastes like wet manioc.

610
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,193
That was delicious.

611
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,360
I must have got,
like, the spine.

612
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,362
ALEX:<i> It's kind of changed</i>
<i>a couple of times</i>

613
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,405
<i>over the last couple days.</i>

614
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,325
Rob has put on a good front
for the whole crew,

615
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,076
other than, I think, me.

616
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,579
<i>He came into this game,</i>

617
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,122
<i>deciding that</i>
<i>he was going to play</i>

618
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,248
like the goofy kid.

619
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,418
I went to go visit my
grandfather in the nursing home,

620
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,213
so I went and I said,
"Grandpa, how's it going?"

621
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,131
He said, "Oh, it's crazy here.

622
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,424
"Every night,
before we go to bed,

623
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,093
they're giving us
hot chocolate and Viagra."

624
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,221
I said,
"Hot chocolate and Viagra?"

625
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,555
ALEX:<i> He really wanted</i>
<i>to get rid of Roger,</i>

626
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,434
<i>and Roger had already come</i>
<i>to me and Butch and Dave.</i>

627
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,937
<i>We kind of all agreed</i>
<i>that Dan was next to go.</i>

628
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,230
<i>Well, then,</i>

629
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,900
Rob came to me and wanted
to get rid of Roger,

630
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,694
<i>and he had Dan and Matt.</i>

631
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,946
So I'm kind of the swing.

632
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,988
I'm kind of the person--
I can decide.

633
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:37,160
<i>I can go, "Which one?",</i>
<i>you know, and...</i>

634
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:37,911
I can go either way.

635
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,622
He said,
"Yes, I'll explain, sir.

636
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,958
"The hot chocolate is
so they go to sleep,

637
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,585
and the Viagra is so
they don't roll out of the bed."

638
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,795
(chuckles)

639
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,840
(sighs)

640
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,817
SHAWNA:
<i>Jaburu is on the upswing.</i>

641
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,461
<i>Deena did an amazing job</i>

642
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,879
<i>taking up the role</i>
<i>of leadership within our tribe.</i>

643
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,923
DEENA: Then after breakfast,
we'll all go get palm fronds,

644
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,510
and then the next two can
go out fishing, if they want.

645
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,761
SHAWNA:
<i>She's got her stuff together,</i>

646
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,347
<i>and she knows how to delegate.</i>

647
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,557
DEENA: Fix these posts
right here, and then...

648
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,642
SHAWNA:<i> And, sometimes,</i>
<i>she can come off bossy,</i>

649
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,894
<i>but you realized</i>
<i>you picked her,</i>

650
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,229
and that's the reason
you picked her,

651
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,315
is 'cause you want her
to boss you around.

652
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,649
-Christy?
-What's up?

653
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,693
I really need you
to work on the fire shelter

654
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,194
and then the roof.

655
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,696
Okay.

656
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,032
DEENA:<i> The net effect</i>
<i>of the leadership has been that</i>

657
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,535
<i>we have, so far,</i>

658
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,747

so that it looks

662
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,338
Like, it looks as if somebody,
yes, lives there

663
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,881
and cares
about their environment

664
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,716

00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,549
Look, that's my Jesus.

684
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,926
(laughs)

685
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,096
-Wow. What is this?
-All right.

686
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,430
Hey, we got mail.

687
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,105
"Caged like an animal,
escape is within sight.

688
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:14,734
Coordinate as a tribe
or face Tribal Council tonight."

689
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,611
"Coordinate as a tribe

690
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,446
or face Tribal Council tonight."

691
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,866
-It's either a maze or a...
-Sounds like a trap.

692
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,118
I'm psyched.

693
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,786
-Anyone else pumped?
-Oh, yeah, baby.

694
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,287
Whoo!

695
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,498
I'm so excited
we're going to challenge.

696
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,126
I really have
a good feeling inside

697
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,212
that we're going to beat
them boys.

698
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,215
I'm ready.

699
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,468
(indistinct conversation)

700
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,641
-Okay.
-♪ Victory is mine ♪

701
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,393
-♪ Victory is mine. ♪
-Yeah!

702
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,148
Is there any chance that Heidi

703
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:57,152
will notice me
at the immunity challenge?

704
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,987
"Yes, definitely."

705
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,488
Yeah, baby!

706
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,948
But will it be positive
or negative?

707
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,499
Break it out.

708
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,085
Will Jenna give
the old man here the look?

709
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,879
All right. All right.

710
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,173
"Outlook good."

711
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,382
Wow!

712
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,550
-♪ Bow chicka-bow-bow. ♪
-Now, that...

713
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,558
How about this?

714
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:33,813
Is the most righteous Dan
going to take the lovely Shawna?

715
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,690
"It is certain."

716
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:36,691
Oh...

717
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,151
-"It is certain."
-Oh, no.

718
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,451
PROBST:
Come on in, guys!

719
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:51,706
Okay. I will take back
the immunity idol.

720
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,917
Clearly, with a very arrogant
addition, I would say.

721
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,128
Thoughts when you see the
immunity idol with their colors?

722
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,506
We'd like to remind them
we had it first.

723
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,507
Yeah.

724
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:00,882
And we'll remove it later.

725
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,008
(chuckling)

726
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,220
Okay, when you guys agreed

727
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,222
to this adventure
in the Amazon,

728
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,059
you basically agreed
to be trapped with strangers.

729
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,061
Today's challenge
epitomizes that.

730
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,731
You are going to be
trapped in a cage.

731
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,399
There's an escape hatch
at the top.

732
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,360
To get to it, you're going
to have to make your way

733
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:24,030
through a rope web of knots
until you release a machete.

734
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,907
Next, you'll find
ten more knots.

735
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,910
Once you've untied those knots,
use the machete

736
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,745
to cut the correct rope,
then slide the board out.

737
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,455
That'll release a pole.

738
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,459
Use the pole to retrieve
three sets of keys.

739
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,962
Use the keys to unlock the locks
and open the hatch.

740
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,257
First tribe to open the hatch
wins immunity.

741
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,468
If everybody in your tribe
does not work together,

742
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,678
you will go to Tribal Council,

743
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,430
and somebody from your tribe
will be going home tonight.

744
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,976
All right, everybody get in
your cages-- I'll lock you in.

745
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,440
For immunity.

746
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,234
Survivors ready... go!

747
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,986
What'd you, uh...
Here it is.

748
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,070
Don't pull it yet.

749
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,780
Pull this.

750
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,490
(grunting)

751
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,576
Throw that rope over to me.

752
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,785
Damn it.

753
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,163
PROBST:
For the first stage,

754
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,293
all you have to do
is release that machete.

755
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,794
I don't know
if I'm doing any good.

756
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:21,087
-Pull it, pull it, pull it.
-That a way, Tambaqui.

757
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,797
-Dave, I finally went...
-Nice.

758
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,299
-I found it...
-Okay, we got this through.

759
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,135
PROBST: Jaburu with two knots
undone on the machete.

760
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,305
Tambaqui with both knots
undone on the machete.

761
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,681
We're down to one knot left.

762
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,308
I can take it. I can take it.
I can...

763
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,976
It's right here.
It goes right through this one.

764
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,269
-Keep pulling. Keep pulling.
-I can't.

765
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,061
She's pulling the other way.

766
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,814
It's Jenna first,
then Christy.

767
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,316
It's going to get into a knot
if we pull like that.

768
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,025
All right, hold it, Alex.
Pull, pull, pull.

769
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,985
Someone feed that.

770
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,486
Someone feed it,
or it's going to get stuck.

771
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,654
-I got it. I got it.
-Alex, good.

772
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,072
Good move, Alex.

773
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,282
Hurry up... hurry up...

774
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,825
Oh, now...
now we got to get it out.

775
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:51,743
I got the machete, guys.
I got the machete.

776
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,620
-Okay. -PROBST: Once that
machete's free,

777
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,830
-you're fine to use it.
-You go inside.

778
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,707
-I'll go outside.
-Jaburu has their machete free.

779
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,460
They're moving on
to the next stage.

780
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,169
Cut! Cut! Cut!

781
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,129
-Dave's got it.
-Okay. Hey.

782
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,339
Dave, Dave... take it, Dave.

783
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,007
-Everybody be careful.
-I got the chain.

784
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:06,716
-All right, go, buddy.
-Go, buddy.

785
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,553
-Got it.
-Go, go, go, go, go!

786
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,846
I'll get the end.

787
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,015
-Come on, Shawna. Awesome job.
-Can we go?

788
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,517
-We can't pull the board.
-Go, go, go, go, go,

789
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,560
-Go, go, go.

-Done.
-It's untied.

792
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,022
-Clear, clear, clear, clear.
-Okay, guys. Come on, push.

793
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,316
-Looking for the keys, guys.
-Okay.

794
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,651
Slide it through, guys.

795
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,152
-Locks.
-One, two...

796
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,071
-Slides up? -Slides up. You

-Jaburu. Jaburu rocks.
-Jaburu rocks.

826
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:41,936
PROBST:
Jaburu!

827
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,438
Who wants it?

828
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,272
Wait.
I'm sorry, guys.

829
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,567
You... you forgot something.

830
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,651
-Oh, that's right.
-That's okay.

831

PROBST:
Jaburu, congratulations.

833
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,198
Immunity;
no Tribal Council tonight.

834

-Three more days in the Amazon.
-Whoo!

835
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,160
Yeah!

836
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,120
PROBST: Tambaqui, sadly,
not the same news for you.

837
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,289
Tribal Council tonight.

838
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,499
Somebody else going home.

839
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,962

840
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,547
Alleluia!

841
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:29,150
Man, I want to lose it
every now and then, but...

842
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,818
Hey, this hurts.
There's no doubt about it.

843
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,820
-It stings. -Yeah, I'm not sure
how evenly matched we are,

844
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,697
having dropped four
out of five challenges.

845
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,116
The Lord is on their side.

846
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,576
Yeah. Uh-huh.

847
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:51,547
Dan is looking for... to get
the votes to go for you tonight.

848
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,508
Whoa!

849
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,718
I wasn't in on it.

850
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,303
ROB:
<i>Roger has told me</i>

851
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,429
<i>that he is at his wit's end</i>
<i>with Daniel</i>

852
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,973
<i>and that he may be very close</i>

853
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,726
to bursting,
and I hope that happens.

854
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,521
I know that any time
any two people in the tribe

855
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,356
are butting heads,
that's good for business.

856
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,858
Who do you think Alex
is going to vote for?

857
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,109
I think Alex
is going to vote for Roger.

858
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,237
-Yeah. Yeah. -A couple days ago,
I thought it was going to be

859
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,656
-you and then me, but I think
we're going to be... -All right.

860
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,366
I think we're going to be here
for a little bit.

861
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,700
Roger's a pain in the ass.

862
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,244
-Yeah, he is a pain in the ass.
-Yeah.

863
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,204
All right, I'm going to walk
back to camp,

864
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,747
but don't walk back...
don't walk back with me.

865
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,374
DANIEL:
Yeah. Yeah.

866
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,418
DANIEL:<i> I'm just trying</i>
<i>to realign right now</i>

867
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,922
<i>with Rob, Alex and Matthew,</i>
<i>and Rob really</i>

868
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,217
<i>wants Roger to go,</i>
<i>but Rob will only vote</i>

869
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,053
against Roger as long as the...
the numbers are there.

870
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,888
Rob, of course, approached me,
and then Matt.

871
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,349
He's going to try to save me,
you know, if he...

872
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,726
whatever he can, but he can't
really do it much himself.

873
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,769
Right.

874
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,229
So it's just all
up in the air.

875
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,940
Wherever you vote,
Rob's going to vote.

876
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,275
That's what he told me, so...

877
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,403
-Hmm. -You vote for me,
he votes for me.

878
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,905
-Hmm. -Vote for Roger,
you... he votes for Roger.

879
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,365
Whatever.

880
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,409
DAVE:<i> Because it is</i>
<i>relatively early in the game,</i>

881
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,786
<i>I don't really trust anybody.</i>

882
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,454
<i>We still are out here</i>
<i>as a game,</i>

883
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,792
<i>and to hear Matthew talk</i>
<i>about how Alex</i>

884
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,044
seems to be trying
to be everybody's friends,

885
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,589
and-and get on different sides,

886
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,800
it made me wonder,
what am I missing?

887
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,760
One for Dan, one for Roger.

888
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,722
-One for Dan, one for Roger.
-One Dan, one for Roger.

889
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,141
Two for Dan, two for Roger.

890
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,560
Yeah.

891
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,812
And then three in a row for Dan.

892
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,148
Good night.

893
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,319
ROGER:
And that will be that.

894
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,237
Mm-hmm.

895
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,311
How you guys feeling?

896
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,479
Rob?

897
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,439
I don't think any of us
are feeling that great.

898
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,650
We're at Tribal Council
for the second time,

899
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,486
which is two more times than any
of us had wanted to be here.

900
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,155
So I think we're feeling
pretty lousy right now, Jeff.

901
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,949
-How about you, Dave?
-Eight guys

902
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,159
certainly don't like to lose
against eight girls,

903
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,327
and, uh, we had a slow start,

904
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,372
but, uh, I really...
I'm-I'm fully confident

905
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,040
that we can come back
and, uh,

906
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,667
pull some big wins
in the near future.

907
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,502
PROBST:
Roger, do you feel a little

908
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,963
like Bobby Riggs
and Billie Jean King?

909
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,632
You're letting down
an entire gender here.

910
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,051
We did everything
as best we could, and...

911
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,386
hey, they beat us, so...

912
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,553
PROBST:
Matthew, how about you?

913
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,847
How hungry,
scale of one to ten?

914
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,349
I'm about an eight.

915
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,351
-That's pretty hungry.
-Manioc is getting very old.

916
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,396
I have a hard time
keeping it down.

917
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,855
How about you, Alex?

918
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,357
About the same as Matthew.

919
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,693
I'm up there at eight,
maybe even a nine.

920
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,821
Mm-- I'm hungry,
and I'm feeling it.

921
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,197
Daniel, how about the fishing?

922
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,907
How many hours a day
are you guys working on that?

923
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,575
We're actually going out there
a couple hours a day, at least.

924
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,704
How many hours of daylight
you figure you get out here?

925
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,038
About ten.

926
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,707
PROBST:
Roger, did you fish today?

927
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,166
Uh, no. I'm not a fisherman.

928
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,002
-PROBST: Matthew?
-I did fish today.

929
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,462
-How long?
-Fished for about an hour.

930
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,215
Would you say it's fair
to say, "Hey, Jeff,

931
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,426
"if you were watching us,
you'd see we are putting forth

932
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,593
everything we can
to try and figure this out?"

933
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,222
I think we could spend
more time out there.

934
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,932
Let's talk about friendships.

935
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,185
Daniel, feeling any bond
with any of these guys?

936
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,896
Well, the person I get
along with the best is Matthew.

937
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,107
He was born in...
in Hong Kong, so...

938
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,525
he's probably more Chinese
than I am.

939
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,401
And, uh, he knows
how to speak Chinese,

940
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,945
so that's a definite plus.

941
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,364
Um, I'm different
than anybody else.

942
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,491
I'm one Asian guy
versus seven other white guys.

943
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,618
Even though I was born
and raised in the U.S.,

944
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,455
you know, just,
even before I speak,

945
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,873
I stand out from the rest,

946
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,458
and sometimes
that makes me an outcast.

947
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,960
ROB:
That is completely false.

948
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,130
I don't think for one second
any of us said

949
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,924
that we're going to treat Daniel
any differently because his,

950
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:04,633
uh, relatives
are from a different country

951
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,761
than our relatives may be from.

952
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,388
We're all from
different places and from

953
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,599
different backgrounds,
and we all realize

954
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,935
that everybody's different
and that's what makes us unique.

955
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,145
PROBST: Roger, you were shaking
your head a little bit.

956
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,231
What's your assessment? I mean,
obviously, there's friction

957
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,942
-between you two guys.
-ROGER: My frustration with Dan

958
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,569
started, uh, when I asked him

959
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,612
to go down to the lake
and get the water,

960
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,698
and he kind of hesitated
and, you know,

961
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,784
"You need to help me,"
kind of a deal.

962
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,287
So I said, "Screw it, buddy.
I'll go down and get it myself."

963
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,623
Well, in defense to...
to what Roger said, uh,

964
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,541
he's been barking orders like
a drill sergeant since day one.

965
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:42,254
Um... I mean, he doesn't...
he doesn't ask nicely, you know?

966
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:46,133
So I said, "Fine. You want
to do it, go right ahead."

967
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,720
So friendship's out the window.

968
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,516
It is time to vote.

969
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,684
Daniel, you're first.

970
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,822
Roger, you've been out here
six days too long.

971
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,907
Talk to you later.

972
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:22,336
Dan, I think I pretty much
said it at Tribal Council.

973
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,004
You're out of your element,

974
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:24,713
<i>and you have not been</i>
<i>a team player.</i>

975
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,951
I'll go tally the votes.

976
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:08,382
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

977
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,050
Person voted out
will be asked to leave

978
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,594
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

979
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,471
I'll read the votes.

980
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:17,600
First vote.

981
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,270
Dan.

982
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,693
Roger. That's one vote Roger,
one vote Dan.

983
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,491
Dan.
That's two votes.

984
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,745
Three votes Dan.

985
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,588
Dan. That's four votes.

986
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,964
That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

987
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,643
Daniel, the tribe has spoken.

988
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,312
It's time for you to go.

989
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,660
You guys have lost four
out of five challenges.

990
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,954
I think you guys know
what you need to do--

991
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:20,829
you just need to go do it.

992
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,582
You can head back to camp.
Good night.

993
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,929

(chuckling):
Hey.

-Guys, help. It's a piranha.
-Bite. Bite.

PROBST:<i> And at Jaburu,</i>
<i>Shawna wants out.</i>

1002
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,325
I don't see myself lasting
for 30 more days.

1003
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,458
Um, I don't re-regret a thing.

1004
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,710
I don't know
what I could have done better.

1005
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,128
I tried my best at first,
you know,

1006
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,213
to start a coup,
but it kind of fell through.

1007
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,131
I didn't mean that anybody,
you know,

1008
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,383
knowingly made me
an outcast of the group,

1009
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,385
but it's who you relate with,
and with eight people,

1010
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,845
you know, you're not
going to be able

1011
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,430
to relate with ev-everybody.

1012
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,850
Roger, somebody made a stop
payment on your reality check.

1013
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:23,767
That's all I gotta say.
