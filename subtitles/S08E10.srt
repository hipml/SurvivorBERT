>> JEFF PROBST: Previously, on

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>Survivor:</i>
After Colby was ousted by Lex's

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:08,466
surprise plan, Jerri celebrated.
(Jerri laughs)

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,887
And Ethan, who was told Jerri
was the target, felt betrayed.

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,056
>> I made an assumption,
thought everything was going

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,893
smoothly and, boom.
>> PROBST: At the reward

7
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,105
challenge, Chapera rolled their
way to victory...

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,066
>> Oh!
>> PROBST: Amber wins the award

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,819
for Chapera!
...winning them the right to

10
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:31,781
loot Mogo Mogo's rice, grill and
fishing spear.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,118
>> I've been waiting 20
days to not have to poke fish

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:39,080
with a stick.
>> PROBST: Late that night, Rob

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,625
and Amber finally connected.
>> I love that he, you know,

14
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:47,255
keeps me warm at night, and he
makes me feel safe out here.

15
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,592
>> PROBST: The following
morning, Rupert realized he

16
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,428
wasn't the sole provider.
>> I'm just glad he

17
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,891
caught a fish.
>> Boston style.

18
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,477
>> Boston Rob.
He's kind of an arrogant pain in

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,937
the ass.
>> PROBST: At the immunity

20
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,274
challenge, Jerri took a gamble
and put Mogo Mogo's fate in her

21
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,818
own hands...
Wide to the right.

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,321
Chapera wins immunity.
...and lost.

23
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:15,325
Back at camp, Jerri was relieved
when Lex told her that Ethan was

24
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,203
the target.
>> I'm just glad it's not me.

25
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,622
>> PROBST: And to avoid
blindsiding his friend from

26
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,042
Africa, Lex told Ethan he was
next to go.

27
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,002
>> It has nothing to do
with friendship.

28
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,838
This is... this is business.
>> PROBST: Ethan scrambled to

29
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,007
stay.
>> Jerri's going to get

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,218
further than you and Shii Ann.
>> No.

31
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,804
>> She might.
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

32
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,015
Council, Ethan was trapped and
couldn't fight his way out.

33
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,851
Ethan.
The last former winner was the

34
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:46,689
eighth all-star to go.
The tribe has spoken.

35
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:52,153
Ten all-stars are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

(saw cutting)
>> Tom and I are definitely the

47
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:39,594
worker bees on Chapera.
I'm not happy for anybody to lay

48
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,597
their ass around in the shelter
and let me do all the work,

49
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,267
but... I can't go in there and
say, "Get your ass out of that

50
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:51,522
bed and go to work."
I can't say that.

51
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,484
Hopefully, the merge is coming
soon, because once we get

52
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:59,489
merged, there's other people,
those Mogo Mogo Mogos hopefully

53
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,951
will actually work.
>> Me and Rupert, we get up

54
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,162
early, and the rest of them lays
in, and we go fishing about

55
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:11,501
every morning.
And if you see that harpoon,

56
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,338
that's the hardest thing to get
that there ever was, 'cause

57
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,384
Rupert been the biggest damn
hog I've ever seen on that

58
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:30,186
thing.
I've been here 22 days, and I've

59
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,065
yet to touch it, and I ain't
leaving here today till I get in

60
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,985
that water with that harpoon.
I'm gonna catch some fish.

61
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,028
>> You gonna get in the water?
>> Yeah.

62
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,697
>> Right now.
>> Yeah.

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,573
>> I wondered why you
was putting your shoes on.

64
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,659
You're gonna go in the water
with your shoes on?

65
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,244
>> TOM: Yeah.
>> Okay.

66
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,287
>> I'll see you when I catch
one.

67
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,123
>> Okay, good luck.
>> ...might be dark.

68
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,041
>> That's okay.
I'll sit here all day.

69
00:04:52,125 --> 00:05:02,051
>> All right.
>> Bring that whale on in!

70
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:12,145
>> All right.
>> Bring that whale on in!

71
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:24,282
>> All right.
>> Bring that whale on in!

72
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:29,579
Very good, Big Tom, very good.
You are the fisher-man.

73
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,165
Big Tom did get him a little
fish.

74
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:36,586
Not a bad fish for his first
fish ever on the spear.

75
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,629
That probably hits in the
goldfish category.

76
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,425
That's a fish tank fish.
But Big Tom got it, and he was

77
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:52,477
thrilled.
>> This rack is wet.

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:01,486
thrilled.
>> This rack is wet.

79
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,698
This place sucks.
The weather here, it's wet, all

80
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:12,455
the time-- just dank, moldy and
wet, all the time.

81
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:17,460
And it's really, really starting
to take its toll on me.

82
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,589
>> Come on, baby, promise
me you got an ember under there.

83
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:25,468
Lots of... lots of patience.
Mornings are always tough for

84
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,638
me, just 'cause you wake up and
there's just nothing to burn.

85
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,474
The wet and rain is just too
hard.

86
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,644
There's no dry wood.
It's just, today, not worth it.

87
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,481
And being on a, you know, the
losing team all the time, it's

88
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:46,656
just depressing.
>> Hey, you guys.

89
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,367
We got some tree mail.
"Today you may improve your way

90
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,953
of life.
It's just a means to the ends.

91
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,164
It may be a battle royal, or you
just might make some friends."

92
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,166
>> Huh.
>> Merge.

93
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,502
>> Yeah.
>> I think it might be a merge.

94
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,171
The tree mail today
came with green paint, which we

95
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,008
don't know what to do with yet.
Either paint each other or paint

96
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,846
something, but it's green.
Mogo Mogo colors, so...

97
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,181
>> I don't know if that's face
paint, so don't put it

98
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,851
it on your face yet.
>> Oh, I wasn't going to.

99
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,271
If I was a betting woman and I
was in Las Vegas, I'd say we're

100
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,523
merging.
>> I can't tell if that's

101
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,984
body paint or not.
I have no idea what the green

102
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,361
paint is about.
I think at this point, rather

103
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,489
than show up looking like a
bunch of, you know, weirdos with

104
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:33,244
paint, we may just bring the pot
of paint with us.

105
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,541
>> Immediately we take
the body paint and start to

106
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,210
paint each other.
The guys have big bulls on their

107
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,838
chest, and the girls do, like,
dots and arrows and... fun

108
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,048
stuff.
You like that?

109
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,384
>> I love it.
>> We took the paint, and

110
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,512
tick-tock, pokey-pokey,
rubby-rubby.

111
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,725
We was just tickled to death.
(bellows)

112
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,935
>> We know that we're going to
go to the challenge.

113
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,730
We don't know if it's going to
be a merge.

114
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,275
We know something is going to
happen.

115
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,367
>> JEFF: Chapera, come on in!
Looking good.

116
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,411
>> Thank you.
>> PROBST: I like it.

117
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:18,080
>> We had fun.
>> We did. Thanks for the paint.

118
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,791
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo, come on
in.

119
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,212
Chapera getting your first look
at the new Mogo Mogo Tribe.

120
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,547
Ethan voted out at the last
Tribal Council.

121
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,466
>> Good.
>> PROBST: What's going on, Mogo

122
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,426
Mogo?
>> How's it going, Jeff?

123
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,720
>> Hi.
>> Hey, guys.

124
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,223
>> Looking dandy in the red.
>> Thank you.

125
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,059
>> PROBST: All right, first
thing I notice, you were both

126
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,437
given a can of paint.
Chapera, what made you guys put

127
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,481
it on your body?
There was no direction.

128
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,025
Rob, is this a sign of team
spirit in a way?

129
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,444
>> Yeah, I guess so.
We're having a good time over

130
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,113
there painting each other.
>> PROBST: At the other end of

131
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,408
the spectrum, why did you guys
decide to do nothing, Kathy?

132
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,245
>> Um, we're just...
we're the civil tribe.

133
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,248
(laughter)
No. We're just, uh... we like to

134
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,917
save things, I guess.
We like to conserve.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,128
>> My canvas is full.
>> PROBST: Okay, here's what I

136
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,923
want to happen.
Mogo Mogo, choose an order, one

137
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,634
through four.
Chapera, choose an order, one

138
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,053
through six, but because you
have two extra people, numbers

139
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,472
five and six will not have a
say.

140
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:20,476
Huddle up and decide and line up
in order.

141
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,981
Okay, we're gonna alternate
between tribes.

142
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,484
Lex, as number one for Mogo
Mogo, you will start.

143
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,988
Pick one member from Chapera
that you would like to sit down

144
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,323
and have a private conversation
with, separated from everybody

145
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:39,161
else.
>> I believe I'll take you, Rob.

146
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,163
>> 'Kay.
>> PROBST: All right, Lex and

147
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,332
Rob, over here.
You're the first pair.

148
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,003
Big Tom, pick somebody from Mogo
Mogo.

149
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,380
>> Uh...
I'll take Jerri.

150
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:53,009
>> PROBST: 'Kay. Jerri and big
Tom gonna have a little chat.

151
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,303
Shii Ann.
>> I'm gonna pick Rupert,

152
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,306
'cause we're both here alone.
>> PROBST: All right, Rupert,

153
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,683
you and Shii Ann are gonna get a
chance to chat.

154
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,811
Alicia, your pick has been made
for you.

155
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,688
>> Yeah.
>> Let's chat.

156
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,190
>> PROBST: Amber and Jenna,
you're gonna get a little more

157
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,234
time together.
>> Yay!

158
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,653
(laughter)
>> PROBST: So we thought it

159
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,865
might be fun 22 days in to have
a formal chance to get to know

160
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,327
people from the other tribe.
To make it more enjoyable...

161
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,495
we put together a little snack
lunch.

162
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,250
(cheering)
>> Oh, my God! Food.

163
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:31,881
>> (laughing): Yay! Yay!
>> Thank you!

164
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,342
>> PROBST: Find a spot anywhere
you like, have a private

165
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:41,223
conversation.
>> I knew this was so

166
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,185
peculiar, I thought it was going
to be something devastating.

167
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:48,230
>> What a day to pick a
good-looking woman.

168
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,567
>> Oh, shucks, I think
I'm blushing.

169
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,404
>> How perfect is this?
I'm glad we get to relax.

170
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,407
>> I was like, oh, my
God, they have to go find out

171
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:03,245
about each other.
>> Oh, my God, Rupert!

172
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,750
Let's dig in.
Oh, those are good.

173
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,003
>> So what's it like
over there all by yourself?

174
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,922
Are you getting along?
>> I love Kathy and I

175
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,926
love Lex.
Jerri is nice, but she doesn't

176
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,430
work as hard as the rest of us.
>> I was so happy to get

177
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,309
away from her.
>> I was worried about you

178
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,938
at first.
>> I was worried about me.

179
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,981
You know what?
This game almost broke my

180
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,109
spirit.
>> That's why I'm here.

181
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,570
They cannot get you down.
We got 18 days.

182
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:41,117
You suck it up, be the stud
you are, put your chest out.

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,412
>> It's been a humbling
experience, to say the least.

184
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,626
>> You know, I'm ready for
a merge, I'm ready for all of us

185
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,795
to be one tribe, I'm ready for
individual challenges, I'm

186
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,131
ready to change the game.
>> Rob is really the

187
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,133
dangerous one.
>> Oh, yeah.

188
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,427
>> It seems, because if we go to
individual immunities, that guy

189
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,013
is going to win and win and win
and win and win.

190
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,517
>> I know.
>> And win.

191
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,811
>> The fact that we're
having this picnic leads me to

192
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,814
believe that we are going to
merge.

193
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:19,822
They're just... waiting.
>> PROBST: Fall in right in

194
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,366
here.
Any order.

195
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,328
All right, drop your buffs.
>> Here we go.

196
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:31,500
>> PROBST: Drop them at your
feet-- time for some new buffs.

197
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,005
Lex.
Reach in and pick a buff.

198
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,259
You're now a member of Chapera.
Have a spot on the red map.

199
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,386
>> Wow.
This is sweet.

200
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,180
>> PROBST: Boston Rob...
What did you think, we were

201
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,349
merging?
Just switching things up.

202
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,977
Look at that, you're now a
member of Mogo Mogo.

203
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,856
You look good in green.
>> I like red.

204
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,152
>> PROBST: Big Tom.
Another member of Mogo Mogo.

205
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:03,199
Sticking with Boston Rob.
You'll still be living as two

206
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,701
separate tribes, it's just new
tribes, that's the only

207
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:12,333
difference.
Jerri, member of Chapera.

208
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,587
So far, nothing has changed but
the color of the buffs.

209
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,547
>> Wow, that's weird.
>> PROBST: Boston Rob, you don't

210
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,884
look pleased about this.
>> They get our camp now?

211
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:27,181
We're not pleased.
Shii Ann, Chapera.

212
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,183
It continues.
>> Weird.

213
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:33,521
>> PROBST: Rupert, you going to
be with your old fellas now?

214
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,482
Look at that.
>> Oh, my God!

215
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,276
>> God!
>> PROBST: So far, six tribe

216
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,697
members have picked buffs and
everything is exactly flipped.

217
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,868
Maybe Kathy will find a new
tribe.

218
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,746
Unbelievable.
>> Weird.

219
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,582
This is weird.
>> PROBST: Something about these

220
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,336
tribes is just meant to be.
All right, Alicia.

221
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,589
You got green.
Still no change to the make-up

222
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,300
of each tribe.
>> This is just weird.

223
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,469
>> It is weird.
>> PROBST: We have two buffs

224
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:10,057
left, one red, one green.
Jenna.

225
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,394
Mogo Mogo.
Amber is the only one to change

226
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:17,147
tribes.
You stay with Chapera but your

227
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:21,402
tribe members are all new.
>> Hi, guys.

228
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:29,326
I'll show you around camp.
>> PROBST: Kind of weird, huh,

229
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,453
Rupert?
>> Very weird.

230
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,956
>> PROBST: Like it was meant to
be.

231
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,959
>> Well, Amber should be here.
>> Amber should be here.

232
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,463
>> The only change is Amber.
All right, so, Lex, Jerri,

233
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:46,760
Amber, Shii Ann, Kathy, you will
be living now at Chapera's camp.

234
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,930
Boston Rob, Big Tom, Alicia,
Rupert, Jenna, you're going to

235
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,808
Mogo Mogo.
Everything you left at camp this

236
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:57,521
morning belongs to the new
owners: the Hawaiian sling, the

237
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,608
fish you may have caught, ready
to eat.

238
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,820
Head on out to your new homes.
>> This is crazy.

239
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:17,166
>> Amber.
>> Thanks for being

240
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:28,010
>> Amber.
>> Thanks for being

241
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:40,522
>> Amber.
>> Thanks for being

242
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,816
our hostess.
>> I definitely feel like

243
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,861
I'm the one who got screwed in
this whole situation.

244
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,988
Kind of nice that I'm still back
at home.

245
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,076
Gosh, I was so mad.
When Jeff held up the new pot

246
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,828
full of buffs and we're all
picking them out, one by one,

247
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,414
really, the main thought that
was going through my head was,

248
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,708
"Let me just pull the same color
that Rob pulls."

249
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,044
This is our camp.
This is our swing.

250
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,254
>> Look at the sofa.
>> Oh, my God, look

251
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,465
at your sofa!
>> This is our lounge chair.

252
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,051
We have a toilet.
>> We came back to our

253
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,720
new home, I realized immediately
that we were so much better off

254
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,556
over here.
I was so excited.

255
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,892
>> This is so cool.
>> It's beautiful.

256
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,561
It's nice to have someplace to
sit besides...

257
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,939
>> And a place for your
feet, too.

258
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,275
>> Oh, my gosh, it is paradise.
>> It's the freakin' Four

259
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,778
Seasons.
>> And there's so much wood

260
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,780
here.
>> They have huge

261
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,784
stacks of logs and dry wood.
There's embers in the fire.

262
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:38,414
There's a swing and a bench and,
you know, a kitchen area.

263
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,750
I mean, it's an organized,
beautiful camp.

264
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,754
>> So you like it?
>> I'm really-- I'm just amazed.

265
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,092
>> Yeah!
>> We almost cried for joy when

266
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,432
we saw the welcome-to-your-new-
home basket of food and drink.

267
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,642
(cheering)
>> Wow.

268
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,770
Look at the bread.
The cheese is so good, you guys.

269
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,232
>> Toast to... welcome to
your new home.

270
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,402
Hope I can make it as
comfortable as possible.

271
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,487
>> You already have.
You already have, Amber.

272
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:16,160
To some civilized talk and food.
>> To more fun.

273
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,079
It's a little strange having
everybody here.

274
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,124
It's definitely not home without
the people that belong here.

275
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:32,176
It kind of sucks.
>> The new Mogo Mogo

276
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:40,768
It kind of sucks.
>> The new Mogo Mogo

277
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,396
definitely got the short end of
this stick, because we inherited

278
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,650
a camp that is in complete
disarray.

279
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,153
>> I have to go get
water, and they only have

280
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,822
one pot, so...
>> They obviously

281
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,451
haven't maintained anything.
Their shelter is tiny.

282
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:01,121
They have very little firewood.
They haven't cleaned up around

283
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,457
camp.
>> You guys don't want

284
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,959
to try to like make a new
shelter or nothing?

285
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,462
You want to just...
>> I say we try to make

286
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,340
the roof better on that one.
I know how bad you want to build

287
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,342
another shelter.
>> It isn't that.

288
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,386
I just want to be able to sleep
at night and I don't think I'll

289
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,681
be able to sleep in that thing.
>> Now, all of a sudden, we have

290
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,351
to make a living here-- no
blankets, no pillows, nothing.

291
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,521
It's a crap camp.
It's in the middle of nettles.

292
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,189
I don't know why they built it
where they did.

293
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,483
It's practically getting washed
away by the tide, which is

294
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,026
extremely high.
They lost their saws, their

295
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:34,905
cooking pot, it's a mess.
>> Look at that.

296
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:39,827
That red...
>> Wow.

297
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,704
>> One nice thing, when
we got here, there was a huge

298
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,542
tray of food, and we immediately
sat down and started eating it.

299
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,712
But, you know, losing Amber and
losing our camp all in one fell

300
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,007
swoop, we didn't feel like we
had too much to celebrate.

301
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,190
>> It's a shame Amber's not
here.

302
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,734
>> It is.
>> It is a shame.

303
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,237
>> They got all our rice.
They got the spear back, they

304
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,781
got the shelter, they got all
the food, they got all the

305
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,867
blankets, they got all the
pillows, they got everything.

306
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,910
>> Well, you know what's
nice about this?

307
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,913
Let them be impressed with what
we've done.

308
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,749
They're going to go there and
realize how well we've been

309
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,253
living.
Maybe that will knock 'em down

310
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:42,723
even further, 'cause they suck.
>> Oh, God.

311
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,976
>> Conditioner.
>> There's the shampoo.

312
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,980
>> We're going to wash our hair.
My hair is so nappy.

313
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,317
>> I had a feeling that
the shampoo and the toothbrush

314
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,236
were going to be the first
things they grabbed.

315
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:03,285
So things like that are hard.
>> Chaperans rock!

316
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,623
I love being a Chaperan.
>> They're already

317
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,417
making themselves at home, it's
kind of weird, but something I'm

318
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,128
going to have to get used to.
This is the new home.

319
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,672
It's the new Chapera.
>> I was at my lowest

320
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,674
point this morning.
Those guys are kicking

321
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,428
themselves.
Unfair trade.

322
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,685
>> I hope she's all
right; I really do.

323
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,354
>> Amber?
She'll be okay.

324
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,314
>> She's got to be
hurting though.

325
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,524
>> Yeah, she's got to be.
>> I wish it were me.

326
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,985
I would have been able to handle
it a lot better.

327
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,155
I care about her.
It kills me to have her over

328
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:46,828
there over by herself.
I know she's tough, but...

329
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,335
...so much of the reason why she
was having such a good time, and

330
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,672
why I was having such a good
time, was because of each other.

331
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,800
Here's to Amber.
>> To Amber.

332
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,052
>> To Amber.
>> Hope she makes it.

333
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:06,431
>> Damn straight.
>> Yeah, she'll make it.

334
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,484
>> I don't really care that the
other team has our camp now.

335
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,362
I don't even really care
that they have all of our

336
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,031
possessions.
As much as we're crying about it

337
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,159
over here, it doesn't matter.
What aggravates me is they got

338
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:36,211
my girl over there.
>> The flag is up.

339
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:48,390
my girl over there.
>> The flag is up.

340
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,728
Our first tree mail as Chapera.
>> What is it?

341
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,732
>> It's a book.
"Mike fell in a fire.

342
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:01,737
Susan's 'rats and snakes.'
Ghandia screamed, 'You're way

343
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,614
too close.'
The Amazon Women had what it

344
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:08,702
takes.
Seven countries later,

345
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:13,707
112 Have played the game.
How well you know your history

346
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,586
determines who will remain."
>> Wow.

347
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,881
>> Wow!
>> Okay. Mike fell in the fire.

348
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,592
Mike caught the pig.
>> Keith couldn't make rice.

349
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,928
Kell got caught with beef jerky.
>> We were boning up on our

350
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,639
<i>Survivor</i> trivia before we went
to the challenge and kind of

351
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,892
trying to forecast what
questions would be asked.

352
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,979
>> Thailand.
John Raymond.

353
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,273
>> One of the things we
went over was the first person

354
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,483
booted from every
single<i> Survivor.</i>

355
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,068
>> Pearl Islands.
>> That girl.

356
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,278
>> With the dress.
>> You don't remember the name

357
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,322
of the woman in the blue dress.
>> No.

358
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,574
>> What else?
>> This is probably the

359
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,494
most important challenge yet to
me, throughout the entire game,

360
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:54,289
'cause I really feel that by
wining this challenge, I'm

361
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,793
either keeping my life going in
the game of<i> Survivor</i> or ending

362
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:07,260
my life in the game of<i> Survivor.</i>
>> How many Jennas

363
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,805
have played this game?
>> Two, two Jennas.

364
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,015
>> How many Robs?
>> Four.

365
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,643
>> Four.
>> I promised Amber I

366
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,146
would take her to the end with
me, but I've got to figure out a

367
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,943
way to get her there.
I'm gonna do whatever I can do

368
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,822
to keep her around as long as
possible over there.

369
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:31,952
Pretty much the next move I make
is gonna have consequences for

370
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:36,748
everybody left in this game--
serious consequences.

371
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:58,979
>> PROBST: First things first.
Take back the immunity idol.

372
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,524
You guys didn't earn it, but you
inherited it had and you became

373
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,692
the Chapera Tribe.
Doesn't matter.

374
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,486
Immunity is back up for grabs.
Let's get to today's immunity

375
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,697
challenge.
It's going to test your

376
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,991
knowledge about something you
should know a lot about:

377
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,077
<i>Survivor.</i>
I'm going ask you a series of

378
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,330
questions pertaining to
<i>Survivors</i> one through seven.

379
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,916
There are a equal number of
questions from each.

380
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,210
I'll draw them randomly from
this bin.

381
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,838
It's a tribal challenge.
You will confer, give me one

382
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,174
answer.
The first tribe to ten wins

383
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,551
immunity, guaranteed a one-in-
nine shot of being the sole

384
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,511
survivor in this all-star
edition, and a one-in-nine shot

385
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,388
at a million bucks.
Make sense?

386
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,891
>> Yes.
>> PROBST: Take a spot on the

387
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:43,565
bench.
>> PROBST: Ready to get started?

388
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,484
>> Yes, sir.
>> PROBST: First question.

389
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,863
"In the Marquesas, which
survivor's arrival at camp was

390
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,116
best described by another tribe
member as 'almost like

391
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,037
Cleopatra'?"
Confer, write it down and don't

392
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,043
reveal till I ask you to.
Let's reveal.

393
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,961
"Sarah, Sarah."
Both tribes say Sarah.

394
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,924
Both tribes are right: 1-1.
Next question: "In Africa, which

395
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:14,763
unlikely pair shared a date at
the drive-in movie?"

396
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,936
Let's reveal.
Mogo Mogo says "Frank and

397
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,604
Brandon."
Chapera says "Brandon and

398
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,439
Frank."
You're both right.

399
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,150
Another point for both tribes.
We're tied up 2-2.

400
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:32,614
"In what country did<i> Survivor:</i>
<i>Africa</i> take place?"

401
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:39,788
>> What is it?
>> PROBST: Reveal.

402
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,790
Chapera says "Kenya."
That's right.

403
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,626
Mogo Mogo says "Nairobi."
That's wrong.

404
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,462
Chapera scores.
3-2 lead.

405
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:51,132
>> Nice, nice.
>> PROBST: "In<i> Survivor: Borneo</i>

406
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,303
what specifically did the
"survivors eat in the first-ever

407
00:25:55,387 --> 00:26:03,770
food-eating challenge?"
>> Is that right?

408
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,605
>> Yes.
>> Good... I mean, the

409
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,649
right term?
>> Yes.

410
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,651
>> Okay.
>> PROBST: Reveal.

411
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,988
Jenna specifically says: "Butok
(bug larvae.)"

412
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,324
Butok is right.
Chapera says "grubs."

413
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,160
"Grubs" is not specific enough,
not right.

414
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,330
We're tied up 3-3.
>> I was wondering if it

415
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,374
was too broad.
>> PROBST: Again from<i> Survivor</i>

416
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,793
<i>I:</i> "Which of the original
castaways used the alphabet

417
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:31,715
strategy when voting tribe
members off the island?"

418
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:40,849
>> No. Oh, yeah.
>> PROBST: Both tribes reveal.

419
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,394
Chapera says "Dr. Sean."
Mogo Mogo says "Dr. Sean."

420
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,272
Both right.
We're tied up at four.

421
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:51,151
"Which outback survivor had to
be airlifted out of the game?"

422
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,864
Reveal.
"Mike Skupin, Mike Skupin."

423
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,658
Both tribes right.
We are still tied 5-5.

424
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:03,038
Next question: "Which Marquesas
survivor picked the unlucky

425
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,583
purple stone during a Tribal
Council tiebreaker resulting

426
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,170
in their exit from the game?"
Reveal.

427
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,882
"Paschal. Paschal."
You're both right.

428
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,594
You're tied at 6-6.
"In<i> Survivor: Thailand,</i> whom did

429
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:22,265
Rob Zubotnik grab by the neck
and toss in the water during a

430
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:26,436
challenge?"
Reveal.

431
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,230
Chapera says "Clay."
Mogo Mogo says "Clay."

432
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,234
Clay is right.
You're still tied, 7-7.

433
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,572
"In the Pearl Islands, who was a
mortician?"

434
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,910
Both tribes reveal.
Chapera says "Darrah."

435
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,912
Mogo Mogo says "Darrah."
"Darrah" is correct.

436
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:48,041
>> I remember Darrah.
(wolf whistles)

437
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:53,046
>> PROBST: We remain tied, 8-8.
"In the Pearl Islands, which

438
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,924
castaway had to be rescued by
tribe mates during a water

439
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,427
challenge?"
Reveal.

440
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,055
Both tribes say "Osten."
Both tribes are right.

441
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:06,101
We are 9-9.
"What was Kell accused of

442
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:11,564
smuggling into the outback by
his tribe?"

443
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,984
Reveal.
"Beef jerky" is right.

444
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:19,280
We're tied up at ten.
We move into a tie-breaker.

445
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,117
It's going to be a time trial.
You'll have 30 seconds to answer

446
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,288
this question.
"Name the first person voted off

447
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,082
each<i> Survivor</i> in order."
Begin.

448
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:38,591
(whispering)
>> PROBST: Ten seconds.

449
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:45,056
Rob working it for Mogo Mogo.
(whispering)

450
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,768
Got some last-minute additions.
>> We're done.

451
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,646
>> PROBST: The tribe with the
most correct will win immunity.

452
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:56,818
Reveal.
Chapera, you say: "Sonya, Deb,

453
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:03,158
Diane, Peter, John and Ryan."
Those first six are right.

454
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,535
Number seven, you said "Kim."
That is wrong.

455
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,164
>> Aw...
>> PROBST: You got six of seven.

456
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:13,209
Mogo Mogo you say: "Sonya, Deb,
Diane, Peter, John, Brian and

457
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,963
Nicole."
Mogo Mogo is right.

458
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,341
You win immunity.
Congratulations.

459
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,479
Who wants it?
>> I'll grab it for us.

460
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,314
>> PROBST: You're going to be
the grabber of immunity?

461
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,150
>> I'm the taker.
>> PROBST: It seems to stick

462
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,028
with you guys, no matter what
color buff you're wearing.

463
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,447
Chapera, sadly, Tribal Council
tonight.

464
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,657
Somebody else from your tribe
going home.

465
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,578
I'll see you there.
Head on back.

466
00:29:56,336 --> 00:30:00,965
>> If you can, if you can.
>> PROBST: Lex, move it out.

467
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,114
>> Kind of a bittersweet win
there.

468
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,951
>> Very bittersweet.
>> Very bittersweet.

469
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,246
We did what we needed to do,
but...

470
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,415
>> You're exactly right.
>> ...at the expense of

471
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,920
one of our own.
>> Today, after the challenge

472
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,048
was over, I grabbed Lex.
I said, "If you can save Amber,

473
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,426
I'll remember it, and I'll help
you later on in the game."

474
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:50,932
If Lex is smart, he'll keep her
around.

475
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,894
>> To hoping that Amber can
figure out some damn way

476
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:59,941
to stay.
>> I hope you make it.

477
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,778
>> Hope you make it, Amber.
>> Today is hard.

478
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:11,953
It's wicked hard.
It hurts a lot.

479
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,455
More than anything in the world,
I want to take Amber to the

480
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,959
final two.
I put an "A" on my arm for

481
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,337
Amber.
Hopefully she makes it to the

482
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:31,889
next challenge.
>> Keeps on rolling, man,

483
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,099
at Chapera. God!
We got back from the challenge,

484
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:36,936
and we lost once again.
What else is new?

485
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,856
>> That's a drag.
>> So, the interesting

486
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,692
dynamic that occurred was, at
the end of the challenge, Boston

487
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,445
Rob went up to Lex and said, "To
protect Amber, I'll protect

488
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,655
you."
I overheard it, and it's such a

489
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,491
godfather move.
>> What do you want to do?

490
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,660
'Cause we've got to make our
decision fast.

491
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,121
>> Well, the thing is, if
we keep Amber, we are totally

492
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,665
sucking up to Mariano.
>> We are, and I don't

493
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,834
think Mariano's going to last
that long.

494
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,003
Kathy and I are trying to figure
out where the possibilities are.

495
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,048
And so far, it still looks like
we're going to have to vote out

496
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,967
Amber.
>> You know, Amber is never

497
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,845
going to be on our side ever.
>> No. That would be the

498
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:13,640
simplest thing.
You vote off Amber, that's one

499
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,141
less original Chaperan.
However...

500
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,061
>> Mariano is just going
to flip.

501
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,647
>> Mariano's going to flip.
He has never, ever...

502
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,148
>> He's got to be pissed,
though, that he's losing his

503
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,025
chick.
>> If we take Amber out,

504
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,195
Rob Mariano's going to be
pretty upset.

505
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,033
And he's going to... the wrath
of God will come down upon us.

506
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:36,162
> So, Amber-Gamber...
>> So, Kathy?

507
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:40,583
I'm voting for Jerri.
That's my desperate attempt.

508
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,670
Well, we lost the immunity
challenge, so now it's strategy.

509
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,881
What am I going to do?
I think I'm a better player than

510
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,508
Jerri.
>> You are.

511
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,760
>> And I'm stronger in
the challenges than Jerri.

512
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,638
>> So, how are you going to get
us convinced to vote for Jerri?

513
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,932
(both chuckling)
>> Do you want me to get

514
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,685
down on my knees and beg?
Please, Kathy, keep me in the

515
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,063
game.
Vote for Jerri.

516
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,191
Right now, I'm just going to try
to make a lot of deals and

517
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,736
promise them a longer time in
the game if they promise me a

518
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,906
longer time in the game.
This is the deal.

519
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:16,077
In the end, it comes down to
you, Lex, me, Rob and Big Tom.

520
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,122
That's what I think.
>> How do we convince Lex

521
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,249
to get rid of Jerri?
>> Well, doesn't he think

522
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,043
that Big Tom will be on our side
in the end?

523
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,087
>> He does think Big Tom
will be on our side, yeah.

524
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,840
And he thinks Rob will come
over, too.

525
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,133
>> So...
>> Um, but he's stuck on

526
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:34,137
this tribal loyalty thing.
I'll talk to Lex about it.

527
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,724
I've just been talking to Amber,
and, um, I actually think it

528
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,893
might make sense to keep her.
Just because, if we do merge,

529
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,145
Mariano is going to carry a
grudge on that one.

530
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,106
>> (sighing): All right.
>> I know.

531
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,066
>> I need a little time
to think about this.

532
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,276
>> I know.
'Cause I think Mariano is going

533
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,571
to hold a grudge.
You do realize that he's going

534
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,323
to kind of be pissed.
>> If we delivered, I think

535
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,910
he would deliver.
>> He will deliver.

536
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,788
>> The only thing about this
that just reeks is that it

537
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,331
is just... it is absolutely
horrible for Jerri.

538
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,293
>> I know it is.
>> But I do think that I

539
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:09,797
can exploit the favor...
>> Please!

540
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,675
>> ...to our advantage.
>> Yeah.

541
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,804
>> Instead of getting rid
of Amber tonight, the decision

542
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,975
to vote Jerri out instead makes
more strategic sense.

543
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:27,148
So... I need to tell Jerri.
You know I love you.

544
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,943
>> Oh, no.
>> And you know I have to

545
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,029
be straight with you.
>> Oh, no.

546
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,990
Explain to me why.
>> Well, with the way

547
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,620
things are going with the other
tribe... and the alliances that

548
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,372
have been made over there, it's
a stronger, more secure play.

549
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,168
>> I don't understand,
like, how everything

550
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,254
switched so drastically.
I mean, is it because Amber gave

551
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,674
up some information or...?
>> There's some information

552
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:58,971
that was passed to me by Rob...
at the challenge.

553
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,224
>> Boston Rob will tell you
anything to keep Amber around.

554
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:05,686
It's so obvious.
He will say anything.

555
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,357
He's got the hots for her, and
they've got some sort of thing

556
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,027
going on.
He will stab you in the back the

557
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,196
second he gets the chance.
Please reconsider, Lex.

558
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:19,367
You're giving up somebody who
has your back to the very end,

559
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,705
and... that right there is
priceless.

560
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,041
>> Let me... let me think
some more.

561
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,044
I mean, I... I don't believe in
ever making a decision without

562
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:33,881
thinking about stuff, so...
This is when the game really...

563
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,385
takes a turn and changes... when
you have to start making really

564
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,303
hard decisions.
>> What happened?

565
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,388
>> We're trying to hash
this out.

566
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,140
>> Yeah, Jerri's just
pleading her case.

567
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,060
So, we just want to make sure
before we blip somebody off into

568
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:47,895
the stratosphere.
>> That we're thinking

569
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,730
about everything.
>> Yeah.

570
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,232
>> All the options
for all of us.

571
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,275
>> All the options when
we get over there.

572
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,111
>> We probably shouldn't have
told her.

573
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,029
>> Oh, no, you had to.
>> No, no, no...

574
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,073
>> No, I mean, I'm glad
we did, but now...

575
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,908
>> 'Cause it's making us
think of things we hadn't

576
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,243
thought about.
>> Yeah.

577
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:06,372
>> Okay.
>> So, we're going to

578
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:11,127
Tribal Council, and no matter
what decision we make, nights

579
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,298
like tonight are just, uh...
miserable.

580
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:38,070
>> PROBST: Hello, guys.
Let's talk about the past few

581
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,406
days.
We brought both tribes together,

582
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,325
the idea being, we would shuffle
the tribes.

583
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:46,370
The former Mogo Mogo stayed
completely together.

584
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,497
The only thing that changed is
you gained a member.

585
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:53,920
Two big events really transpired
when this went down.

586
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,296
First one was, you got a new
home.

587
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,423
Kathy?
>> Oh! (scoffs)

588
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:01,093
I mean, you know, it's a
four-star hotel, you know?

589
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,304
We're coming from the 3-M Motel
over on Mogo Mogo, so it's so

590
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,431
much better.
And you know, I mean, I was

591
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:09,143
embarrassed that we didn't go a
little further with our camp for

592
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,020
those poor guys.
But no, it's great!

593
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,814
I mean, we couldn't be happier.
And can you see you get

594
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,775
stronger.
>> PROBST: The other big result

595
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,986
of this tribe shuffle was one
person shuffled, and that was

596
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,363
you, Amber.
And the look on your face...

597
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:24,784
>> Yeah, I was extremely upset.
It was... it was impossible to

598
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,328
hide.
And that first night, it was

599
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,498
really hard.
But I woke up the next morning

600
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,000
and told myself, "It's a new
day, and so, I'm not going to

601
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,961
let myself get down."
I had one down night, and that

602
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,379
next morning I woke up, and I
was a new tribe.

603
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:41,175
>> PROBST: So, just like that,
the loyalty you had with Boston

604
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,887
Rob and Big Tom and everybody
else on your old tribe is gone?

605
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,223
>> I can't make any guesses
what's going to happen in this

606
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,142
game, so I have to play with my
new members, and these are my

607
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,520
new tribe members.
>> PROBST: Shii Ann, it's got to

608
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,481
be a little hard to trust that.
Obviously, odd person out.

609
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,526
So, when she says, "Hey, I'm
with you guys," what's the part

610
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,987
of you going, "Hmm, I don't
know?"

611
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,406
>> I mean, it would be
silly to think her, you know, 20

612
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,534
some-odd days with those guys is
just erased by the last three

613
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,870
days.
But she's a member of Chapera,

614
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:15,209
just like the rest of us, and
trust is something that is built

615
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:18,504
one day at a time here.
>> PROBST: Jerri, this was a

616
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,091
reunion for you.
>> Yeah. I was just like,

617
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,386
"Oh, my Outback sister, she's
back with me!" you know?

618
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:30,057
It was... it was very exciting,
but I also realized that it's a

619
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,519
totally different game.
Everyone has come into this game

620
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,564
with different personalities and
with different goals.

621
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,943
>> PROBST: Lex, in a way, was it
nice to get Amber?

622
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,571
Because really, your tribe could
stay intact, and you could get

623
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,615
rid of the opposition, after
having come to a Tribal Council.

624
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,910
>> I'd be lying if I said
it was any other way.

625
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,537
And I think that, you know,
that's just a harsh reality of

626
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,083
the game.
But we all know the game has so

627
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,755
many twists and turns, it ain't
over until it's over.

628
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,216
>> PROBST: Amber, if it's you
tonight...

629
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,469
>> If it's me tonight, I
know that I went out trying as

630
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,638
hard as I possibly could not to
go.

631
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,434
So, if I'm leaving tonight, I'm
leaving tonight fighting hard to

632
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:17,271
stay in.
>> PROBST: It is time to vote.

633
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:27,281
Lex, you're up.
>> Amber, I'm very proud of the

634
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:36,624
Lex, you're up.
>> Amber, I'm very proud of the

635
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:42,421
way you're playing this game.
You did go down fighting.

636
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,477
>> It's crazy that it's
come down to me voting you out

637
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,480
to keep myself in this game.
I owe you a huge thanks for

638
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:13,494
that.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

639
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:25,673
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

640
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,009
decision is final.
The person voted out will be

641
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,178
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.

642
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:36,308
I'll read the votes.
First vote...

643
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:41,564
Jerri.
Amber.

644
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:48,028
One vote Amber, one vote Jerri.
Jerri.

645
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,032
That's two votes Jerri, one vote
Amber.

646
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,244
Ninth person voted out of
<i>Survivor: All-Stars...</i>

647
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,329
Jerri.
That's three votes.

648
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,623
That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

649
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,550
>> I just want you guys
to know, it's been an honor

650
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,720
playing this game with you.
Thank you.

651
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,265
(chuckling): I'm going to go
eat some chocolate.

652
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,767
>> PROBST: Jerri, the tribe has
spoken.

653
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:31,572
It's time for you to go.
Well, tonight's Tribal Council

654
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:36,368
proved something once again.
It ain't over till it's over.

655
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:40,581
Grab your torches.
Go back to camp.

660
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,226
The game is on.
>> I made promises that I

661
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,769
don't know if I'm going to be
able to keep, but at least I got

662
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,813
myself three more days.
>> PROBST: Not knowing Amber's

663
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,484
fate, Rob makes a new plan...
>> I made an alliance with

664
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,693
Alicia, and now I've got
one with everyone.

665
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,279
>> PROBST: ...and goes back on
his word.

666
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,908
>> I'm sorry you feel that way.
I really, truly am.

667
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,830
>> This has truly been,
again, a life-changing

668
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,749
experience.
I think I've done the

669
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,836
impossible.
I have found a way to find peace

670
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,759
in a very stressful situation,
and now I'm ready to go out into

671
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:37,721
the world and see what other
craziness I can conquer.
