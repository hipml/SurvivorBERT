00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,900

340

342

So, Denise, in my book,
she's A-OK.

343
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,574
I'm gonna tell everybody.
I'm gonna say,

344
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,992
"She's a high profile.
She dethroned the queen with

345
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,869
-her own bullet."
-(laughs)
-DENISE: No! You're gonna...

346
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,913
-"Shot her down and paid half...
-You're gonna be voted out
after the merge.

347
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,415
-...and paid her half price
for that bullet."
-See, you're gonna get me

348
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,584
-voted out.
-Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna say,
"No, she's a threat.

349
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,586
-Keep her around."
-They'll all be like,
"Thanks, Tony.

350
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,629
Thanks a lot."

351
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,421
TONY:
High profile right here.

352
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,340
<i>JEREMY:</i>
<i>Tony thinks Denise is,</i>

353
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,384
<i>like, growing on...</i>

354
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,094
that target echelon.

355
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:10,140
<i>But Tony is clearly still</i>
<i>the biggest threat out here.</i>

356
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,600
<i>He's still a big name.</i>

357
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,436
He's still crazy, wild Tony.

358
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,063
<i>I do like Tony,</i>
<i>but he is the bigger threat</i>

359
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,732
<i>in this game.</i>

360
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,783
Not about this.

361
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,785

362
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,663
when we merge and we don't have
a plan and don't come for it,

363
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,122
like, we're gonna
get picked off.

364
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,457
Yeah.

365
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,084

Denise is still--

366
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,087
-Denise is with us. You know?
-Yeah. Yeah, I agree.

367
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,089
<i>KIM:</i>
<i>I feel good</i>
<i>with this group of people.</i>

368
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,466
<i>It's a bit of</i>
<i>an interesting dynamic.</i>

369
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,636
Like, I have this relationship
with Tony.

370
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,804
<i>I love Tony.</i>

371
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,973
<i>However, I really feel good</i>
<i>with Jeremy and Denise.</i>

372
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,476
You know? Like, Jeremy and I
particularly have a great bond,

373
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,395
and I really like Denise
a lot as a player.

374
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,354
I trust her.

375
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,189
<i>I think she's well-meaning.</i>

376
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,483
<i>I think</i>
<i>we could play well together.</i>

377
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,193
So if push came to shove,

378
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,154
I think I could be convinced
to go with them, at this point.

379
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,782
<i>And I haven't been dominating</i>
<i>this game.</i>

380
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,994
<i>And so I like being in charge</i>
<i>of my own fate out here</i>

381
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,663
<i>and getting the chance</i>
<i>to make new bonds with people.</i>

382
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,832
I think
it gives me more options.

383
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,834
When that all went down
like that, like, I had a moment

384
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,628
where I'm like, "We're
gonna merge in a few days,

385
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,171
-"one way or the other...
-Yep, and we've got, like-- Yep.

386
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,256
-...and we need to have a plan."
-Plan.

387
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,426
So, in that, are you-- how are
you feeling about the three?

388
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,011
-Me, you and Jeremy?
-Jeremy-- Yeah.

389
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,012
-Super awesome.
-Just-- Awesome.

390
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,847
-Like, that is...
-I-I just want to make sure

391
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,350
-you still feel super awesome
after yesterday.
-Yes. 100%.

392
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,477
-I don't want to be the person
that's trying to catch up.
-Right, right.

393
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,269
-I want to go with a plan.
-And march forward.

394
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,563

-NICK: The 40. There's the 40.

670
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,024
Five pieces left for Dakal.

671
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,151
Six pieces for Sele.
Make it five.

672

-MICHELE: Right there.

Find where it goes.

Wendell with another piece.

675
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,241
-Sele in the lead now.
-You guys got it.

Wendell getting close.

680
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,168

-KIM: Yes, yes, yes.

00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,226
Wow!

688
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,979
By seconds.

689
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,689
Maybe<i> a</i> second.

690
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,983
Dakal pulls it out.

691
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,277
Wow, what a battle.

692
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,868
Yara, great strategy
out of the gate. Paid off.

693
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,912
Immunity is yours.

694
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,540
Nobody going home from
your tribe. Grab your stuff.

695
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,833
Head out. Enjoy the night off.

696
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,545
The all-important second place.

697
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,047
That was about
as close as it can get.

698
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,923
It was probably
less than a second.

699
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,884
Dakal pulled it out.
Safe tonight.

700
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,219
No Tribal Council.

701
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,888
Nobody going home.

702
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,390
Grab your stuff. Head out.

703
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,975
Tribe stays intact.

704
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,897
Nick, this is
a familiar feeling,

705
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,901
losing the exact
same challenge again.

706
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,778
What is going through your mind?

707
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,196
This is absolutely
the most brutal loss

708

This is...

709
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,408

710
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,743
Sucked.

711
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,578
And the fact
that it is this challenge,

712
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,080
it's like salt in the wounds,
it's...

713
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,082
It makes it so bad.

714
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,043
All right, Michele, Yul,
Nick, Wendell,

715
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,252
Tribal Council tonight.

716
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,921
Somebody will be

717
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,422
the ninth person
voted out of this game.

718
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,048
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

719
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:55,965

836
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,436
What, Wendell?

837
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,105
-That smirk, Probst.
-(chuckles)

838
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,149
What do you mean?
I'm just looking at you.

839
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,735
Yeah.

840
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,945
It wasn't the best of days.

841
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:54,282
We gave the, uh, the challenge
our best, but, uh,

842
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,283
we lost by a second. It sucks.

843
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,744
And it sucks to be here.

844
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,914
But because you were so close,
does it change the afternoon

845
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,833
when you think about
who to vote out?

846
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:07,462
No. No. It doesn't change who...

847
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,296
the group decided to vote out.

848
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,590
No.

849
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,301
Yul, all of the old-school
players are gone

850
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,802
-with the exception of you.
-(chuckles)

851
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,305
But I wonder,
is there something to the idea

852
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,559
that<i> Survivor</i> has grown so much
in terms of twists and pace

853
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,269
and that it really is
just older-school players

854
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,981
have a tougher time
with the new game?

855
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,609
I mean, it's entirely true.
The game has evolved.

856
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,111
It's much more complex,
much more fast-paced.

857
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,279
I'm playing
a very different game

858
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,614
than I played
the first time around.

859
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,617
I've had to lie more
in this game already

860
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,994
than I did the entire time
on Cook Islands

861
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,663
because you're
voting someone out,

862
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,665
but now you want them
to like you

863
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,709
and not think that you were
part of voting them out

864
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,836
so that they will give you
their fire tokens.

865
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,171
That adds

866
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,174
yet another layer of duplicity
that did not exist before,

867
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,675
and this is now, like,
three notches

868
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,219
above where I played before.

869
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,096
This game sounds fantastic!

870
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,389
It is. I-I think it's really
interesting. The fire tokens

871
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,184
give you an opportunity to have
this kind of market economy

872
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,019
to align incentives.

873
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,563
So, for example,
you might say, "Okay,

874
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,232
I think we should do this."
But the person says, "No,

875
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,025
this is too risky.
I don't want to do it."

876
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,193
"But what if I gave you
a fire token to do it?"

877
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,362
Then, at that point,
the economics work out.

878
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,823
They're thinking,
"Okay, the reward

879
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,741
is worth the risk,"
and that adds

880
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,244
a whole new layer of options
that didn't exist before.

881
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,954
PROBST:
So, Wendell,

882
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,664
you do have to lie to people.

883
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,041
You have to blindside them.

884
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,044
You might want their fire tokens
to be given to you.

885
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:32,046
How do you combat that?

886
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,340
You try to find somebody

887
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,384
or some people
that you can trust

888
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,887
in this game
of not a lot of trust.

889
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,597
PROBST:
And, Nick, that connects to

890
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,058
preexisting relationships,

891
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,394
because they have
had time to form

892
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,728
-a trust.
-Yes.

893
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,480
Yul, you're... I asked Nick,

894
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,731
-but you're nodding.
-YUL: Look,
that's exactly the case.

895
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,276
When you land on the beach,
you have a finite amount of time

896
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,362
to reach out
to as many people as you can,

897
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,740
to get to know them,
build trust and then strategize.

898
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,784
If you have
a preexisting relationship,

899
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,578
all that stuff
has already been done.

900
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,580
PROBST:
So, Wendell,

901
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,623
we've already talked about
you and Michele

902
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,126
having
a preexisting relationship.

903
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:11,502
WENDELL:
Yeah, it's scary.

904
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,254
But just because

905
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,715
I know Michele
from outside the game,

906
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,925
that doesn't necessarily mean

907
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,137
I want to go far with her
or sit next to her at the end.

908
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,388
I'm playing to win this game,

909
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:26,893
so I would like to work
with anyone to get me

910
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,228
to the end of this game.

911
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,771
PROBST:
Michele,

912
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,607
what are you smiling at?

913
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,401
Wendell has made it very clear
that he's here for him

914
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,445
and not for anybody else.

915
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,448
And as
a preexisting relationship,

916
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,743
to hear
that you don't really care

917
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,828
about what happens to me
in the future,

918
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,538
then I don't know

919
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,958
how I can potentially work
with that.

920
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:55,171
So, everybody sees the tension
that is me and Wendell.

921
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,089
-It's not lovers' paradise
going on here.
-(laughs)

922
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,968
And it's not going super great
for us at all times,

923
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,262
and I think
that's pretty apparent.

924
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,598
Let me correct you briefly.

925
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,475
I do care about
what happens to you.

926
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,601
-Okay?
-I think he said
let him correct<i> you.</i>

927
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,354
-Yeah, yeah. No, he...
-Let me correct what I said

928
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,648
-or how you interpreted it.
-(chuckles)

929
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,650
My sincerest apologies,
Michele Fitzgerald.

930
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,278
-Mm-hmm.
-I care for you and your future.

931
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,488
-Okay.
-All right.

932
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,447
PROBST:
All right.

933
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,491
So, Nick,

934
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,534
you do have to decide
who's going home.

935
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,495
Was today different?

936
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,624
Or was it just another day
on the beach,

937
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,209
trying to strategize?

938
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,543
NICK:
Uh, I think today

939
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,671
was definitely different,
at least for me,

940
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,173
because the person
that gets voted out tonight

941
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:39,715
will go to the Edge.

942
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,009
So, look, if it's me,

943
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,345
you know,
no burnt bridges on my part,

944
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,847
'cause this is my final four,
and I would want

945
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,808
to just come right back in
and work with them.

946
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,810
PROBST:
Wendell, I have
never heard anybody

947
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,688
say that in that way, which is,

948
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,483
"We're so tight, I will
come back and join you guys."

949
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,693
Are you down with that, as well?

950
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:03,864
It might sting a little bit
if I'm sent to the Edge tonight,

951
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,493
and it might be
a little more difficult for me

952
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,495
to win my way back in and join
this alliance that just...

953
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,706
-Everyone just lied to me.
-(laughs)

954
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,207
You know what I'm saying?
It's like,

955
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,542
"Y'all just lied to me
and sent me to the Edge,

956
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:18,713
"so I'm not so gung ho about
working with you guys again."

957
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,922
PROBST:
So, Yul,

958
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,465
Nick says no hard feelings.
Wendell says,

959
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,758
"Who are we kidding?

960
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,219
You guys would've
just been lying to me."

961
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:25,886
I will be very bitter
at you guys

962
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,680
if you blindside me tonight,

963
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,349
but I want to leave the option
of working with you,

964
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,309
because that may be
my only option.

965
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,270
And so far,
I feel like I know you better

966
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,439
-than I know anyone else
in the game.
-PROBST (chuckles): Wow.

967
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,025
Michele, that's tough.

968
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:39,817
It's basically saying,

969
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,570
"Oh, yeah,
I'll try to get over it,

970
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,530
but you'd be better off
to not do it."

971
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,116
-(chuckles)
-MICHELE: Yeah. I mean,

972
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,577
I love every single one
of these boys,

973
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:55,416
and I don't want to have
to make a decision like this.

974
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,625
But this is the game,
unfortunately.

975
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:01,297
And we were blessed at first
to all be on a tribe together,

976
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,965
and now we're cursed
by the same blessing,

977
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,051
and we know that.

978
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,055
PROBST:
All right.

979
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,057
