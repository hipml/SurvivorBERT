1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,086
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY
ON "SURVIVOR."

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,088
IN A VAST AND UNFORGIVING
NICARAGUAN RAIN FOREST,

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,133
FORMER N.F.L. COACH
JIMMY JOHNSON EMERGED

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,260
AS A LEADER OF THE OLDER TRIBE,

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,262
BUT MARTY WAS ENVIOUS
OF THE COACH'S STAR POWER.

6
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,765
>> I NEED TO REMOVE HIM
SO PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR DADDY

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,016
AND THEY'LL HAVE TO COME TO ME.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,145
ON THE YOUNGER TRIBE, BRENDA,
A FORMER N.F.L. CHEERLEADER,

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,271
WAS AT THE TOP
OF THE FOOD CHAIN.

10
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,441
>> I HAVE PEOPLE ON MY SIDE
WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING.

11
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,902
I GET A GOOD VIBE FROM NAY
AND I'M TIGHT WITH CHASE.

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,028
WE COULD RULE THIS.

13
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,948
KELLY B. AND ALINA WERE
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN,

14
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,283
BUT THEY HAD A CLUE
TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

15
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,452
>> WE KEEP IT BETWEEN US.

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,787
>> AT THE CHALLENGE, THE YOUNGER
TRIBE TOOK A BIG RISK

17
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,789
BY NOT USING THE MEDALLION
OF POWER.

18
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,915
>> WE CAN TAKE THEM
WITHOUT USING IT.

19
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,041
>> Jeff: AND THE RISK PAID OFF.

20
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,753
BECAUSE WHILE JIMMY T.
DISTRACTED THE OLDER TRIBE...

21
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:45,295
>> YOU'RE WASTING ME BACK HERE.

22
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,464
>> JIMMY T., BE QUIET.

23
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,299
>> Jeff: ...THE YOUNGER TRIBE
CRUISED TO VICTORY.

24
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,593
>> IF THESE PEOPLE KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING

25
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,136
I WOULD BE THE LEADER
OF THIS TRIBE.

26
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,138
>> Jeff: AFTER THE CHALLENGE,
WITH TOTAL DISREGARD

27
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,182
FOR KELLY B.'S ARTIFICIAL LEG,
NAONKA TACKLED HER

28
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:01,686
IN ORDER TO GET A NEW CLUE
TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

29
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,772
>> I'LL PUSH YOU SO HARD THE LEG
WILL FALL OFF.

30
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,191
>> Jeff: SHE SHARED THE CLUE
WITH BRENDA.

31
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,861
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, JIMMY T.
WAS GUNNING FOR JIMMY J.

32
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,279
>> MAYBE I'M A THREAT
TO HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE

33
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,323
BECAUSE I AM A LEADER
WHERE I COME FROM.

34
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,325
>> Jeff: THE COACH AND DAN
WERE THOUGHT TO BE

35
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,078
THE WEAKEST PLAYERS BUT ONLY
JIMMY WOULD ADMIT TO IT.

36
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,331
>> I'M THE OLDEST PLAYER
AND ONE OF THE WEAKEST, TOO.

37
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,500
>> Jeff: BETWEEN MARTY'S
ALPHA MALE COUP

38
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,795
AND JIMMY JOHNSON'S HONESTY,
THE COACH WAS SENT HOME.

39
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,005
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

40
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:33,176
IN VOTING OUT JIMMY JOHNSON
YOU VOTE OUT A PROVEN LEADER.

41
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,345
WHO'S GOING TO STEP UP
AND FILL THOSE SHOES?

42
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,846
17 ARE LEFT.

43
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,891
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

44
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,363
>> HOW ABOUT YOU?

45
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,199
YOU GONNA MAKE IT
THROUGH THE NIGHT?

46
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:56,491
HUH?

47
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,202
>> YEAH.

48
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,331
>> WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

49
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,417
THE LEADERSHIP
THAT JIMMY JOHNSON SUPPLIED

50
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,296
IN EVERYBODY'S EYES WAS NOTHING.

51
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,339
HE GAVE A COUPLE
OF CHEERLEADER SPEECHES

52
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,008
THAT ANY CHUCKLEHEAD COULD DO.

53
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,343
HE DIDN'T PUT
HIS BEST PEOPLE FORWARD.

54
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,429
HE DEFINITELY WASN'T
A JIMMY T. FAN

55
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,265
AND I WASN'T GOING TO GET
A LOT OF PLAYING TIME

56
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,350
WITH HIM CALLING THE SHOTS
AND IF HE WAS A PLAYER

57
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,728
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ON MY ALLIANCE, THAT'S FOR SURE.

58
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,565
SO I'M NOT GOING
TO MISS HIM TOO MUCH.

59
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,234
BAD WAVES PASSING ON THE BEACH

60
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,155
AND FOR ONE DESPERATE MOMENT.

61
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:39,367
HE CAME BACK IN OUR MEMORY,

62
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,455
GUY'S SO CRAZY, SO CLOSE.

63
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,668
AND STILL JUST OUT OF REACH...

64
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,212
>> JIMMY T. IS PUTTING
ON THE JIMMY T. SHOW,

65
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,422
ANNOYING, SINGING,
TRYING TO DO HIS BEST.

66
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,425
IT IS JIMMY T., MAN,
THAT'S WHO THIS GUY IS.

67
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,720
HE'S A LOUD MOUTH, HE JUST...

68
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,430
HE HAS TO HEAR
HIS OWN VOICE 24/7.

69
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,893
TAKE IT EASY, BABY, MAKE IT
LAST NIGHT, LAST ALL NIGHT...

70
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,936
>> IT'S JUST...

71
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,773
THIS GAME TRIES YOUR PATIENCE
IN SO MANY WAYS

72
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,984
AND THAT GUY'S JUST...

73
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,903
IT'S JUST OBNOXIOUS.

74
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,071
SO I MEAN ALL YOU'VE GOT
TO DO WITH JIMMY T.

75
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,031
IS GIVE HIM JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF ROPE.

76
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:18,615
THAT'S ALL HE NEEDS
AND HE'LL HANG HIMSELF

77
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,491
FROM THE NEAREST BRANCH.

78
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,736
>> WOW, THIS IS
ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

79
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,158
>> SOMEPLACE ON NICARAGUA

80
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,326
THEY MUST HAVE HAD EIGHT
OR TEN INCHES OF RAIN

81
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,996
AND ALL THAT WATER WE'VE HAD

82
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,290
MIXED WITH THE LAST COUPLE
OF DAYS

83
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,459
OBVIOUSLY IS JUST COME ON DOWN

84
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,504
AND FOUND ITS WAY BACK
TO THE OCEAN.

85
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,007
>> THE ENTIRE BEACH
IS JUST COVERED WITH DEBRIS.

86
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,342
ALL SORTS OF WOOD
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

87
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,344
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
OUR BEACHFRONT HERE IS GONE.

88
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,887
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IN THERE.

89
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,181
AND IT'S ALL COVERED WITH MUD.

90
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,475
THE OCEAN'S ALL FILLED WITH MUD.

91
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,686
IT'S REALLY A MESS.

92
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,020
>> IT'S BEEN A TOUGH DAY
AND A HALF FOR ME.

93
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,232
I BURNT MY FOOT
AND COOKED MY SNEAKERS.

94
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:34,941
>> COOKED YOUR SHOE!

95
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:39,028
TOO BAD WE CAN'T EAT YOUR SHOE.

96
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,029
FILLET OF SOLE.

97
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,030
(\LAUGHS\).

98
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,532
>> THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

99
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,494
WE DON'T GET FOOD SOON WE'RE
GOING TO BE EATING MY FOOT.

100
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,163
THIS PLACE IS GOD FORSAKEN.

101
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,708
>> IT IS. IT'S JINXED.

102
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,835
>> FOOD IS A HUGE ISSUE.

103
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,919
IT'S TERRIBLE.

104
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,798
OUR BAY THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO DO THE FISHING IN

105
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,384
IS COMPLETELY WASHED OUT
SO WE HAVE...

106
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,427
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE LAZING
AROUND WAITING FOR FOOD TO COME.

107
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,556
WE HAVE NO FOOD
AND NO MEANS OF GETTING IT.

108
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,182
SO WE'RE DOWN TO TWO CUPS
OF RICE A DAY

109
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,560
AND OUR RATIONS IS

110
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,353
PROBABLY GOING TO PUT US DOWN
MORE THAN THAT.

111
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,397
SO, YEAH, WE'RE STARVING
AND WE'RE PRETTY SICK ABOUT IT.

112
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,733
>> HE'S JUST DOING...

113
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,067
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING.

114
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,737
HE WAITS UNTIL THE FISH
COMES DOWN, WAITS FOR THEM,

115
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,113
SNAGS 'EM WHEN HE SEES HIM

116
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,449
AND THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD BE
FISHING RIGHT NOW.

117
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,576
>> WE REALLY NEED
TO CATCH SOME FISH TODAY.

118
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,661
>> YEAH, HE'S DOING IT.

119
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:33,082
LOOK, THAT WASN'T HARD.

120
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,545
AND THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS SET OUT A NET THERE.

121
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,589
OKAY, JANE, I HAVEN'T TRIED
THROWING THIS YET.

122
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,632
I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

123
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,427
>> WE CAN TRY TO THROW IT
WITH THE TWO OF US.

124
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,679
>> WELL, THERE'S GUYS
THAT DO IT IN THE REAL WORLD,

125
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,473
THROW IT WITH ONE GUY.

126
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:53,561
>> I KNOW, BUT I'M NOT ONE
OF THOSE GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE.

127
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,730
>> YEAH.

128
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,608
>> YEAH...

129
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:03,654
THAT WAS GOING TO WORK
IF IT DIDN'T HIT MY FOOT.

130
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,448
I'LL TRY A COUPLE TIMES,
SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

131
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:10,745
>> ALL RIGHT.

132
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,246
>> NOTHING.

133
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,457
>> I DO BELIEVE EVERY ONE OF US
IS GOING TO MISS JIMMY JOHNSON.

134
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,626
I MEAN, I'M GOING TO MISS HIM

135
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,128
BECAUSE HE WAS AS GOOD
A FISHERMAN AS ANYBODY.

136
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,381
BUT EVERY TEAM I'VE EVER BEEN ON
HAD A CAPTAIN AND A CO-CAPTAIN

137
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:27,595
AND THEY MADE DECISIONS BASED
UPON THE ABILITY OF THE TRIBE.

138
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,931
AND I'M HOPING
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO STEP UP

139
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,058
AND SAY "I WANT THAT ROLE."

140
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,492
>> I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT IT RAINED LAST NIGHT

141
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,661
UNTIL I WOKE UP THIS MORNING
AND I TRIED TO CLIMB OUT

142
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,830
OF THE SHELTER
AND IT WAS A LITTLE WET.

143
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,831
I SLEPT THAT WELL.

144
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,873
>> IS THAT THING OUT?

145
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,333
>> PRETTY MUCH.

146
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,544
>> BRENDA HAS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE RIGHT NOW

147
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,005
AND SHE'S BEEN TRYING
TO DECIPHER IT.

148
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,509
>> DIG EIGHT YARDS WEST.

149
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,510
TREE-MAIL?

150
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,011
>> WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO LOOK
FOR IT TODAY

151
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,141
BUT THESE CLUES ARE REALLY,
REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT.

152
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,818
>> MAYBE IT'S TREE-MAIL.

153
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,822
SO, UM, REMEMBER
HOW THE CLUE SHOWS THE TREE

154
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,865
AND THE GUY NEXT TO THE TREE?

155
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,866
AND IT HAS THE SUN, RIGHT?

156
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,867
SO IT'S WEST.

157
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,368
>> YOU ARE GOOD!

158
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,871
>> SO MAYBE LIKE ALIGN YOURSELF
WITH THE TREE AND THE SUN

159
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:39,709
SO THAT YOU'RE RIGHT IN FRONT
OF IT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU DIG.

160
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:44,380
DIG EIGHT YARDS WEST
OF TREE-MAIL.

161
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,716
>> WEST IS THAT WAY
SO IT'S LIKE IN THE BUSHES.

162
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,718
>> LOOK, WEST...

163
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:04,525
>> LOOK AROUND, LOOK AROUND.

164
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,610
>> IT'S RIGHT THERE?

165
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,611
>> WHAT IS THAT?

166
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,737
>> THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE!

167
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,614
>> GET IT! GET IT!

168
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,033
OH, MY GOD!

169
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,034
>> WHERE ARE WE GOING TO PUT IT?

170
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,787
>> OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

171
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,498
IT'S THE KEY TO OUR LIFE
IN THE GAME.

172
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,791
THE IMMUNITY IDOL IS MINE, MINE,

173
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,295
IT DOESN'T BELONG
TO ANYONE ELSE.

174
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,296
BRENDA HELPED ME FIND IT

175
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,758
BUT ULTIMATELY I FIGURED IT OUT
AND IT'S MINE.

176
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,093
>> THAT WAS CRAZY.

177
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,762
>> THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
IS IN MY SOCK.

178
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,430
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

179
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,766
I CAME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE
FROM SOUTH CENTRAL L.A.

180
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,144
AND I THINK IT'S STARTING TO
FINALLY HIT ME THAT, YOU KNOW,

181
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:40,978
IT'S A MILLION DOLLARS
ON THE LINE,

182
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,314
IT'S A MILLION DOLLARS
ON THE LINE.

183
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,607
>> WHEN YOU FIND
THE IMMUNITY IDOL

184
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,608
YOU JUST DON'T TELL ANYBODY.

185
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,694
>> AND THAT WOULD NOT LET ANYONE
STAND IN MY WAY.

186
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,864
NOT EVEN A ONE-LEGGED PERSON CAN
STAND IN MY WAY AS YOU CAN SEE.

187
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,283
ONE SHOVE SHE'S OUT OF HERE.

188
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,622
>> IT'S LONELY OUT HERE.

189
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,749
>> THE HARDEST THING
FOR ME RIGHT NOW

190
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,834
IS TO PRETEND THAT I LIKE NAY.

191
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,628
UGH.

192
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,088
YOU KNOW?

193
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,589
>> I KNOW.

194
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,799
>> KELLY B. AND I HAVE REALLY
BUILT A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

195
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,218
I REALLY LIKE HER.

196
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,013
SHE'S SUCH A NICE PERSON AND
SEEING THE WAY NAY TREATS HER,

197
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,974
IT MAKES ME SO FURIOUS.

198
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,142
SHE TACKLED A GIRL WITH ONE LEG.

199
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,519
LIKE HOW SICK IS THAT?

200
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,021
HOW CAN IT BE REALLY
THAT HARD TO FIND?

201
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,022
>> THE CLUES DON'T HELP.

202
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:30,444
NOR DOES LIKE SEARCHING
EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?

203
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,200
>> WE HAVE TO FIND IT.

204
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,503
>> I KNOW WHERE THEY WENT.

205
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,171
I SAW THEIR FOOTSTEPS.

206
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,965
THEY WERE OVER IN THIS AREA.

207
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,800
AND THEY WERE, LIKE, THAT'S
THE ONLY PLACE THEY WERE AT.

208
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:56,012
SOMETHING'S OVER HERE.

209
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,180
>> I'VE BEEN WATCHING
ALINA AND KELLY B.

210
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,349
RUNNING LIKE A WILD BANSHEE
LOOKING

211
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,892
FOR THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

212
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,311
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FIND IT.

213
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,229
THE IDOL'S ALREADY FOUND
AND IT'S HIDDEN.

214
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,357
SO WHAT DO I HAVE
TO LOSE RIGHT NOW? NOTHING.

215
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,818
SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO SCARE
THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE WEAK.

216
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,695
IF YOU GET IN THEIR HEAD
AND THEY'RE SCARED,

217
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,363
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.

218
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,823
YOU GUYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

219
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:20,828
>> NO SECRET, LOOKING FOR THE
SAME THING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

220
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,414
>> SO IF YOU SEE ME
WATCHING YOU GUYS...

221
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,915
>> FOLLOW US.

222
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,250
>> WHAT?

223
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:26,876
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE YOU.

224
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,877
NEVER HAVE LIKED YOU.

225
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,878
DON'T TRUST YOU.

226
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,879
>> NAONKA IS PSYCHO.

227
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,923
KELLY B. NEVER DID ANYTHING
TO NAY.

228
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,133
NEVER.

229
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,052
EXCEPT FOR GO FOR THE SAME CLUE.

230
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,720
>> I KNOW THAT LITTLE
PERFORMANCE YOU PUT ON

231
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,721
AFTER THAT [NO AUDIO] WENT DOWN.

232
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,722
I KNOW ABOUT THAT.

233
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,182
I JUST PUSHED YOU.

234
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,391
>> YOU KNOCKED ME OVER?

235
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,392
>> YEAH.

236
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,602
>> YEAH!

237
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,145
>> BUT YOU SAID
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE DID IT.

238
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,147
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

239
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,148
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

240
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,107
>> OKAY, WHATEVER.

241
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,400
NAY'S A BULLY.

242
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,402
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE
TO CALL SOMEONE

243
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,695
WHO KNOCKS YOU OVER.

244
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,405
I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT ME

245
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,573
FINDING SOMETHING OUT THERE,

246
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,950
BUT SHE WANTED
A REACTION OUT OF ME,

247
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,243
I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IT TO HER

248
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,914
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S REALLY
HARD TO, LIKE, CONTAIN YOURSELF.

249
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,374
>> YOU'RE IN THE OUTS.
I'M NOT WITH YOU, SO...

250
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,416
>> WHY AM I ON THE OUTS?

251
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,000
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

252
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,294
>> I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

253
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,754
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING TO YOU.

254
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,255
I REALLY DON'T NEED
NO CHARITY CASE ON THE JURY,

255
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,883
BECAUSE FOR SURE, FOR SURE,
SHE WILL NOT VOTE FOR ME

256
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,218
TO GET THE MILLION DOLLARS.
CONTINUE LOOKING.

257
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,469
>> WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT WAY?

258
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,553
>> GOOD LUCK LOOKING FOR IT.

259
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,098
TORTURING KELLY B.
MENTALLY MIGHT EVEN FORCE HER

260
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,391
TO JUST QUIT THE GAME.

261
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,393
AND SCREW YOUR LEG.
SCREW YOUR LEG.

262
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,395
KEEP IT AWAY FROM THE FIRE.

263
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,159
>> YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING
THROUGH IT, AND, QUITE FRANKLY,

264
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,287
I COULDN'T SPEND TEN DAYS WITH
NO FOOD WITH MY FAMILY OUT HERE

265
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,164
WITHOUT KILLING ONE OF THEM, SO
I THINK WE'RE DOING REALLY GOOD.

266
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,124
>> I THINK WE ARE,
'CAUSE IT'S BEEN...

267
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,459
IT DOESN'T GET MUCH TOUGHER
THAN THIS, GUYS.

268
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,919
>> YEAH, IT'S HUGE.

269
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:52,962
WE'RE DOING GOOD, AND WE'RE ONLY
GOING TO GET BETTER

270
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,590
AS TIME MOVES FORWARD, I THINK.

271
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,634
WHAT...? ANY OTHER
OBSERVATIONS OTHER THAN...?

272
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,010
>> NO, I JUST THINK,
FOR THE CHALLENGE,

273
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,096
I THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE...

274
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:02,972
EITHER, FOR THE MOST PART,
ONE VOICE

275
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,599
THAT'S GOING TO DELEGATE

276
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,810
WHO'S GOING TO DO WHICH PARTS
OF THE CHALLENGE,

277
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,603
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW,

278
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,647
THE PERSON
THAT'S STUCK OUT THE MOST,

279
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,524
I THINK, IN TERMS
OF CONTRIBUTION OR WHATEVER,

280
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,984
HAS BEEN TYRONE.

281
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,779
SO, IF YOU WANT TO DO IT,
I WOULD NOMINATE YOU TO DO IT,

282
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,449
AND WE'VE GOT TO FALL IN LINE
AND JUST MAKE SURE

283
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,326
THAT EVERYONE LISTENS
AND IS OKAY WITH THAT, UM...

284
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,329
>> YOU KNOW, I'M JUST LISTENING
IN, AND IT'S TOUGH FOR ME.

285
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,624
AS YOU GUYS KNOW, I'VE SNAPPED
ON SEVERAL OTHER OCCASIONS.

286
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,917
I BARK ONCE IN A WHILE.

287
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,044
I'M A LEADER WHERE I COME FROM,
I LIKE TO BE A LEADER,

288
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,839
BUT IN THIS SITUATION, I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO BE THE LEADER,

289
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,674
AND I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT.

290
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,009
I'M GOING TO SNAP ONCE
IN A WHILE,

291
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,051
AND SAY, "PLAY ME! PLAY ME!"

292
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,012
BUT IF YOU DON'T, THAT'S FINE,
I CAN ACCEPT THAT.

293
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,806
AND I'M WILLING
TO JUST PLAY MY ROLE.

294
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,183
>> IT'S NOT LIKE...
>> RIGHT.

295
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,017
>> YOU KNOW, WE GO IN THE THING
AND NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING...

296
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,227
>> I'M ALWAYS GIVING
MY OPINION.

297
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,229
>> IF YOU THINK YOU'RE REALLY
GOOD AT ONE PART OF IT,

298
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,647
SAY, "OKAY, I'M READY,

299
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,483
I'LL BE THE GUY TO TAKE
A PUZZLE ON." OR WHATEVER.

300
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,859
>> MARTY'S DEFINITELY NOT
A BIG JIMMY T. FAN.

301
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,360
IT HAS TO STEM
FROM INSECURITIES,

302
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,904
'CAUSE I'M AN EASYGOING GUY.

303
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,864
YOU KNOW,
HE WANTS ULTIMATE CONTROL,

304
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,365
AND NOBODY SAY ANYTHING,

305
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,075
AND ANY TIME I TRY
TO GIVE SOME INPUT,

306
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,828
HE TRIES TO MILDLY,
HUMBLY SHOOT IT DOWN.

307
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,206
>> SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT DOING
DEEP, DEEP ASSESSMENTS ABOUT,

308
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,082
YOU KNOW, HEY,
"WHAT DO YOU DO THE 40 IN?

309
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,083
AND WHO DOES, YOU KNOW,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

310
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,544
>> A COUPLE TIMES,
I'D LIKE TO TELL MARTY,

311
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,047
"WILL YOU SHUT UP,
YOU PREPPY LITTLE BITCH?

312
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,340
YOU WOULDN'T LAST A MINUTE
IN MY WORLD."

313
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,674
>> BUT PEOPLE SHOULD SAY

314
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,926
WHAT THEY FEEL
THEY'RE GOOD AT OR WHATEVER,

315
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,553
AND THEN, YOU GOT
TO BE THE TIE-BREAKER.

316
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,555
>> I'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM
A LITTLE SHAKE.

317
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,725
"MARTY! GET A CLUE!"

318
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,020
HEY, BUT MAYBE ONCE I LOSE IT,
THAT'S THE NEXT THING I'LL DO.

319
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,817
(\MONKEY HOWLING\)

320
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,034

TO HAVE TO GUIDE.

00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,926
>> OH.
>> WE SHOULD PRACTICE.

00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,116
YEAH, WE'VE GOT TO GET THE "W,"

338
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,159
AND THE OTHER TRIBE
IS NOT A FACTOR TO ME.

339
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,580
JILL, STOP.
JILL, RIGHT TWO.

340
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,291
DAN, STOP. DAN, RIGHT THREE.

341
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,752
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT IF
WE GIVE 110% OF OUR BEST EFFORT,

342
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,629
WHICH IS DISCIPLINE
AND LISTENING, I THINK

343
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,965
WE'LL DO BETTER, BECAUSE WE'RE
TYPICALLY MORE DISCIPLINED.

344
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,675
WE'RE OLDER.

345
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,010
>> EVERYBODY, WHEN HE GIVES
THE INSTRUCTION, RIGHT,

346
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,138
HE'S GOING TO GIVE 15 STEPS
IN WHATEVER DIRECTION,

347
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,765
YOU GOT TO DO THAT AND YOU GOT
TO STOP WITHOUT HIM SAYING STOP.

348
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,058
>> YES.

349
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,310
>> BECAUSE THEN HE'S GOING
TO GO TO THE NEXT PERSON,

350
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,936
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE...

351
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,021
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST WAIT
AND WORK ON ONE PERSON.

352
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,480
YOU GOT TO BE MULTITASKING.

353
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,857
>> I NOMINATED TYRONE LAST NIGHT

354
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,817
AS THE LEADER FOR THE CHALLENGE,

355
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,569
AND, BY THE WAY,
I KNEW IT WOULD RILE JIMMY T.

356
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,529
YOU KNOW, HE'S LIKE
A THREE-YEAR-OLD.

357
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,157
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
>> J.T. IS DELUSIONAL.

358
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,618
HE HAS NO IDEA.
HE SUFFERS FROM BOTH PARANOIA

359
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,661
AND FROM DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR.

360
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,871
>> HE DOESN'T NEED
TO TELL YOU...

361
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,913
>> DON'T TURN
IN THAT DIRECTION...

362
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,166
>> JANE, WELL, DO WHATEVER
INSTRUCTION HE DOES,

363
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,876
AND THEN,
WE AUTOMATICALLY STOP AND WAIT

364
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,835
FOR THE NEXT INSTRUCTION.

365
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,295
>> ANYBODY THAT CALLS OUT
JIMMY JOHNSON,

366
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,839
AND SAYS THAT JIMMY JOHNSON
MIGHT BE INSECURE

367
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:27,968
BECAUSE OF JIMMY T.'S LEADERSHIP
CAPABILITIES

368
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,053
HAS GOT SOME ISSUES GOING ON.

369
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,353
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

370
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,693
YOUNGER TRIBE GETTING YOUR FIRST
LOOK AT THE NEW OLDER TRIBE.

371
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,987
JIMMY JOHNSON VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

372
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,989
(gasping)

373
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,534
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY
TO GET TO TODAY'S CHALLENGE?

374
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,994
>> YES.

375
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:54,620
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.

376
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,246
I WILL TAKE BACK IMMUNITY.

377
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,171
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

378
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,215
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

379
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,258
ONE PERSON FROM EACH TRIBE
WILL BE YOUR CALLER.

380
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,220
THE REST OF THE TRIBE WILL BE
BLINDFOLDED AND PAIRED UP.

381
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,431
USING ONLY VERBAL COMMANDS,

382
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,225
THE CALLER WILL DIRECT
THEIR TRIBE MATES

383
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,020
TO COLLECT TEN ITEMS
SCATTERED IN THE FIELD.

384
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,231
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL
TEN ITEMS BACK,

385
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,776
THE CALLER WILL THEN DIRECT ONE
PAIR OUT TO FIND A SET OF KEYS.

386
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,903
THOSE KEYS WILL UNLOCK A CHEST.

387
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,405
FIRST TRIBE TO GET THEIR CHEST

388
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,075
AND ALL TEN ITEMS BACK
TO THE START WINS IMMUNITY,

389
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,119
IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

390
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,121
IN ADDITION,
YOU ARE PLAYING FOR REWARD.

391
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:42,042
THE WINNING TRIBE WILL CHOOSE
THREE GROUPS OF ITEMS

392
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,461
FROM SEARS.

393
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,130
YOU HAVE A MASSIVE TOOL KIT,

394
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,717
TARP, ROPE, KNIFE,
A COMPLETE FISHING KIT.

395
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,135
>> YES!

396
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,887
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, NOW LET'S
GET TO THE MEDALLION OF POWER.

397
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,222
YOUNGER TRIBE,
YOU STILL HAVE IT.

398
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,932
IF YOU USE IT
IN TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

399
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,100
YOUR ADVANTAGE WILL BE TO BEGIN
WITH TWO ITEMS

400
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,227
ALREADY BACK
AT YOUR STARTING MAT.

401
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,355
GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO FIGURE OUT
IF YOU WANT TO USE IT.

402
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,275
>> I THINK THAT
WE SHOULD USE IT. >> USE IT.

403
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,820
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE,
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?

404
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,571
>> I THINK WE'RE GOING
TO USE IT.

405
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,281
>> GONNA USE IT.
BENRY, GIVE IT

406
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,741
TO SOMEBODY
FROM THE OLDER TRIBE.

407
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,951
OLDER TRIBE NOW HAS
THE MEDALLION OF POWER

408
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,120
AND WILL GET A CHANCE TO USE IT
AT A FUTURE CHALLENGE.

409
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,247
THIS CHALLENGE RUNS
WITH ONLY SEVEN TRIBE MEMBERS.

410
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,833
OLDER TRIBE,
YOU'RE SITTING ONE PERSON OUT.

411
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,084
WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?

412
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,252

YOUNGER TRIBE,
YOU'RE SITTING OUT TWO PEOPLE.

415
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:29,757
WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?

416
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,633
>> THE TWO KELLYS.
>> YEAH.

417
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,136
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SIT-OUTS,
TAKE A SEAT ON THE BENCH.

418
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,679
EVERYBODY ELSE, I'LL GIVE YOU
A MINUTE TO STRATEGIES.

419
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,723
WE'LL GET STARTED.

420
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,399
ALL RIGHT, FOR THE YOUNGER
TRIBE, BRENDA IS THE CALLER.

421
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,819
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE,

YOUNGER TRIBE STARTING WITH
TWO ITEMS ALREADY ON THEIR MAT.

423
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,158
MEANS THEY ONLY HAVE
TO COLLECT EIGHT ITEMS.

00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,755
>> Jeff: JIMMY T. AND HOLLY DROP
THE FOURTH ITEM

503
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,006
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

504
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,007
>> GO STRAIGHT.
STOP, JILL!

505
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,301
TURN LEFT THREE.
STRAIGHT! NO, LEFT, JILL. STOP.

506
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,304
>> Jeff: YVE AND JANE WITH FIVE
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

507
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,430
>> GO BACK OUT, STOP.

508
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,015
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE
HAS ALL TEN ITEMS.

509
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:25,515
NOW THEY'VE GOT
TO FIND THE SET OF KEYS...

510
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,559
>> GO TO THE KEYS.

511
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,810
>> Jeff: ...TO UNLOCK THE CHEST.

512
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,187
>> GO TO YOUR LEFT, CHASE!
TO YOUR LEFT!

513
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,230
>> YVE, STOP!

514
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,440
>> Jeff: OLDER TRIBE
IN HUGE TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.

515
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,650
>> YVE, GO RIGHT!

516
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,943
>> IS HE TALKING TO US?

517
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,319
>> JIMMY T., GO RIGHT!

518
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,112
>> MOVE TO YOUR LEFT!
TO YOUR LEFT!

519
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,615
TO YOUR LEFT! GET THE TREE!
YES, YES, YES, YES!

520
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,783
>> JIMMY T., GO RIGHT 20!

521
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,119
>> Jeff: SASH AND CHASE HAVE
THE KEYS TO THE CHEST NOW.

522
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,205
>> KEEP GOING FORWARD!
THE CHEST IS IN FRONT OF YOU.

523
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,623
>> YVE! YVE, TURN AROUND, STOP.

524
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,999
>> THERE YOU GO, UNLOCK IT.

525
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:51,750
>> Jeff: HOLLY, JIMMY T.
HAVE BEEN WANDERING...

526
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,502
>> STOP, JIMMY T.!
STOP, JIMMY!

527
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,003
>> Jeff: ...FOR A LONG TIME
WITH NO IDEA...

528
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,380
>> JIMMY, STOP!

529
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,466
DAMN, THAT BOY DON'T LISTEN!
JIMMY T.!

530
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,509
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE
HAS THEIR BLOCK UNDONE.

531
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,220
>> BRING IT BACK TO ME.

532
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,471
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE
HAS THE CHEST.

533
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,765
THEY'RE HEADING BACK
FOR THE WIN!

534
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,724
>> YVE, STOP MOVING! YVE!

535
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,978
>> Jeff: OLDER TRIBE
IN COMPLETE DISARRAY.

536
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,187
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

537
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,771
>> GO RIGHT! TURN RIGHT!

538
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,523
>> KEEP GOING STRAIGHT.

539
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,857
>> JIMMY T...

540
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,900
>> HERE! UP HERE! ON THE
PLATFORM! ON THE PLATFORM!

00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,195
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE WINS
IMMUNITY AND REWARD!

542
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,197
(\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\)

543
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,783
>> WHEN I WAS OVER THERE,
I COULDN'T HEAR YOU

544
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,869
OVER EVERYBODY ELSE
SCREAMING AND YELLING, SO...

545
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,871
(cheering)

546
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,418
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE,
CONGRATULATIONS.

547
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,711
IMMUNITY ONCE AGAIN.

548
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,755
(\APPLAUSE\)

549
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,384
IN ADDITION, YOU NOW GET
TO SELECT THREE GROUPS OF ITEMS

550
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,386
FROM SEARS TO TAKE WITH YOU
BACK TO CAMP.

551
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,014
WHAT ARE THE THREE GROUPS?

552
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,100
>> FISHING, THE TARP
AND THE COOKING SUPPLIES.

553
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,060
>> ALL RIGHT,
COME GET YOUR ITEMS.

554
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,104
PUT THEM IN YOUR CRATE.

555
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,984
>> OH, MY GOD!

556
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,532
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, OLDER TRIBE,
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

557
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,660
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FOURTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

558
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,412
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

559
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,414
I WILL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

560
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,604
>> IT WAS REALLY TOUGH.

561
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,065
I MEAN, IT WASN'T EASY,
YOU KNOW?

562
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,983
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS IN IT

563
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,318
I DON'T THINK
IT WOULD HAVE MATTERED.

564
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:41,818
YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST TOUGH.

565
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,779
IT WAS JUST TOUGH.

566
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,280
I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD ON MUD

567
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,948
SO I'M NOT A MUDDER,

568
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,452
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE POWER
OF THE MEDALLION REALLY DID IT.

569
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,581
>> YEAH, AND THAT ALONE SAYS
SOMETHING ABOUT US, YOU KNOW?

570
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,917
THEY NEEDED AN ADVANTAGE
TO BEAT US.

571
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,252
>> UM, IT'S GOOD TO SIT HERE

572
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,339
AND SAY WELL, WE DID GOOD,
WE DID GOOD.

573
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,842
BUT, LOOK, I'M GOING TO CONTINUE
TO ASK TO GET A LITTLE ACTION.

574
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,511
I THINK I CAN CONTRIBUTE.

575
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,304
I'M...

576
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,640
I'VE COACHED BASKETBALL TEAMS
AND I'VE COACHED CREWS,

577
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,642
I CONTINUE TO COACH CHILDREN
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

578
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,644
I THINK I CAN BE A LEADER
IN IMMUNITY CHALLENGES

579
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,145
AND I'D LIKE THAT OPPORTUNITY.

580
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,271
>> SO TODAY DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU

581
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,606
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE VALUABLE SOMEWHERE ELSE?

582
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:23,235
>> UM, PROBABLY NOT.

583
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,486
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY

584
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,113
TO HELP THIS TEAM WIN.

585
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,323
I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST

586
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,866
AND I CAN BE SUCCESSFUL
IN THE FUTURE.

587
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,742
I JUST WANT A FAIR OPPORTUNITY.

588
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,287
DOESN'T EVEN GET
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY?

589
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:38,375
>> JIMMY T.,
HE'S DIGGING HIS OWN HOLE.

590
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,128
EVERY TIME WE HAVE A CHALLENGE
HE'S VERY NEGATIVE AFTERWARDS.

591
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,839
VERY NEGATIVE HE SAYS
"ALL I WANT IS A SHOT.

592
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,465
"I CAN GET IN THERE,

593
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,341
I CAN MAKE SOME THINGS,
I'VE COACHED."

594
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,009
YOU KNOW, START GIVING ME
HIS RESUME.

595
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,512
BOTTOM LINE IS
HE'S VERY MUCH ABOUT HIM

596
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,055
AND IT'S BECOMING MORE
AND MORE CLEAR

597
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,641
AND THE COMMENTS TODAY
I DIDN'T DIG AT ALL.

598
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,650
>> WHAT!

599
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,819
>> A LOT OF GEAR IN THERE.

600
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:06,903
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

601
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,029
>> GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.

602
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,072
GOOD JOB.

603
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,324
>> GOD BLESS SEARS.

604
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,534
>> WHAT A WIN.

605
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,577
>> NEW KNIVES.

606
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,037
>> YEAH WE HAVE
A WHOLE KNIFE SET.

607
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,874
>> A WHOLE KNIFE SET.

608
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,544
>> OH, MY GOD!

609
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,045
>> WHAT WE WANTED MOST!

610
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,631
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

611
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,383
A TARP, BABY!

612
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,509
WHOO!

613
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,220
>> WE CAN SLEEP NOW.

614
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,763
>> AS SOON AS I OPENED
THE TACKLE BOX

615
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,599
I SAW A ROLLED UP PIECE
OF PAPER.

616
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:39,269
I KNEW IT WAS A CLUE AND AS SOON
AS I SAW THAT I SHUT IT.

617
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,270
>> LET'S HAVE A LITTLE
WATERMELON CELEBRATION.

618
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,064
EVERYONE ELSE WENT OVER
AND LOOKED AT THE TARP

619
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,900
OR WHATEVER THEY WERE
LOOKING AT, I DIDN'T CARE.

620
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,069
I GRABBED THE NOTE,

621
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:52,032
FOLDED IT UP,
PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND...

622
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,409
BRENDA IS A VERY CLOSE ALLY
OF MINE.

623
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,745
I'D PROBABLY TRUST HER
MORE THAN ANYONE OUT HERE.

624
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,706
I HAVE A CLUE IN MY POCKET.

625
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,583
>> WHAT?

626
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,084
>> YEP.

627
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,253
I'M TELLING YOU THAT BECAUSE
I TRUST YOU, YOU KNOW?

628
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,421
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

629
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,090
SO NOW WHAT?

630
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,718
>> NOW WE LOOK FOR IT.

631
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:16,890
DIG EIGHT YARDS LEFT
OF TREE-MAIL.

632
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,099
>> LET'S GO.

633
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,851
>> LET'S GO.

634
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:24,439
>> IF WE CAN GET THIS IDOL,
WE'RE GOLD.

635
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,774
>> CHASE FOUND THE THIRD CLUE.

636
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:30,779
HE FIGURED OUT WHERE
IT SHOULD BE IF IT WAS THERE

637
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,656
AND I JUST FELT SO BAD
BECAUSE HE IS MY BUDDY.

638
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,867
DO YOU TRUST NAY?

639
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,245
>> DO YOU TRUST HER?

640
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,955
>> I TRUST HER.

641
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,956
>> YOU DO?

642
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,957
>> DO YOU TRUST ME?

643
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,083
>> I TRUST YOU.

644
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,125
>> WHO DO YOU TRUST MORE?

645
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,001
>> YOU.

646
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,336
>> LIKE HOW MUCH MORE?

647
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,505
>> I TRUST YOU MORE
THAN ANYONE HERE.

648
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:52,133
>> GOOD.

649
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,762
WELL, THEN I'VE GOT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

650
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,265
>> WHAT?

651
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:03,019
IT'S EITHER EIGHT YARDS THAT WAY
OR EIGHT YARDS WEST.

652
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,688
DO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE CLUE?

653
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,445
>> OKAY, THIS IS THE THING.

654
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,655
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

655
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,072
>> GO AHEAD.

656
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,283
>> OKAY. UM...

657
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,160
SO IF NAY FOR WHATEVER REASON
CONFIDED IN ME

658
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,829
BECAUSE SHE REALLY DOES TRUST ME
AND I TRUST HER.

659
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,998
>> WHY ARE YOU WORRIED?

660
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:27,877
>> BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO KEEP
MY TRUST

661
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,462
WITH THE PERSON WHO HAS
THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

662
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,381
>> SOMEONE HAS
THE IMMUNITY IDOL?

663
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:31,673
WHO? NAY?

664
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,841
>> YEAH.

665
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,176
BUT I FOUND IT FOR HER.

666
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,177
>> YOU SWEAR TO ME?

667
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,178
>> I SWEAR TO YOU.

668
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,179
>> YOU GUYS FOUND IT?

669
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,097
>> I SWEAR TO YOU WE FOUND IT.

670
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,807
>> YOU CAN NOT TRUST ANYONE IN
THIS GAME

671
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,226
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO.

672
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,686
NAONKA AND I DON'T HAVE
A GREAT TRUST

673
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,397
BUT WE DO HAVE BRENDA
BETWEEN US, YOU KNOW?

674
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,733
SO AS LONG AS NAY'S

675
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,235
NOT COMING AFTER ME,
THEN THAT'S FINE.

676
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,236
CAN I DO THIS?

677
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,362
>> WHAT?

678
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,655
>> CAN I GO UP TO NAY
AND BE LIKE...

679
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,031
>> YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

680
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:56,865
SERIOUSLY.

681
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,534
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

682
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,202
IF WORD GETS OUT
THAT I TOLD CHASE,

683
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:01,911
NAY WON'T TRUST ME ANYMORE
BECAUSE I...

684
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,748
I BETRAYED HER TRUST.

685
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,167
WHICH IS BIG BECAUSE
SHE'S THE ONE WITH THE IDOL.

686
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,543
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
MY POSITION.

687
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,878
SHE HAS IT.

688
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,380
SO IF I BETRAY HER, WE'RE ALL--

689
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,424
ME, YOU-- ARE ALL SCREWED UP.

690
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,729
>> NOT A LOT
OF SEA URCHINS HERE.

691
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,065
>> THAT'S A BIG ONE, ISN'T IT?

692
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,191
>> YEAH GOOD ENOUGH.

693
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,150
YOU CAN GET SOMETHING
OUT OF THAT.

694
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,236
>> OH, WE'RE DIGGING AROUND
FOR SEA URCHINS.

695
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,822
WE'RE REALLY HURTING FOR FOOD

696
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,074
AND THIS IS ABOUT IT.

697
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,786
YOU GET TINY LITTLE GLOP
OF SALTY PROTEIN.

698
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,371
BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD.

699
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,582
THEY ACTUALLY ARE
JUST A BIT OF FLAVOR

700
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,793
AND YEAH,
WE'RE DOWN TO SEA URCHINS NOW.

701
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,802
>> MARTY, YOU'RE NOT
CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMPANY POT?

702
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,097
>> I JUST GRABBED TWO OR THREE
OF THE LITTLE TINY ONES.

703
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,932
>> TWO OR THREE OVER HERE,

704
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:04,808
TWO OR THREE OVER THERE
THEN TWO OR THREE OVER THERE.

705
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,602
WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE TEAM?

706
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,104
COME ON, MAN, BE A TRIBE PLAYER.

707
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,730
>> NOT GONNA GO THERE WITH YOU,
BUDDY.

708
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,565
YOU GUYS CAN EAT
ALL THE ONES YOU CAUGHT.

709
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,775
>> ALL RIGHT.

710
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,111
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

711
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,113
>> APPRECIATE THAT.

712
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,827
TRYING TO CALL ME OUT
AS A NON-TEAM PLAYER

713
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,620
BECAUSE I ATE
A COUPLE SEA URCHINS

714
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,956
AND I DIDN'T CONTRIBUTE
SEA URCHINS TO HIS NET,

715
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,958
HE JUST DOESN'T GET THIS GAME.

716
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,626
YOU DO THAT,

717
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:36,214
THAT'S THE PERFECT WAY TO ENSURE
YOUR DESTINY IN THIS GAME.

718
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,930
>> OH, BACK THERE HE WAS LIKE...

719
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,306
>> OH, WITH THE...

720
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,307
>> YOU EATING THE URCHINS
ALL BY YOURSELF.

721
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,393
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE A TEAM PLAYER.

722
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,602
GIVE ME A BREAK.

723
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,146
>> YOU ARE.
DON'T WORRY, YOU ARE.

724
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,772
>> OF COURSE I KNOW THAT.

725
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,940
SO JIMMY T. TRYING TO TELL ME

726
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,693
THAT I'M NOT A TEAM PLAYER

727
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,945
AND CALLING IT OUT
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE TRIBE?

728
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,489
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF PUTTING
A GUN TO YOUR MOUTH,

729
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,158
PULLING THE TRIGGER AND BLOWING
YOUR BRAINS OUT

730
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,160
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

731
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,339
>> I'M GOING TO WRITE
DANNY'S NAME DOWN.

732
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,008
I DON'T WANT
TO BUT I'M GOING TO.

733
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,302
I THINK HE'S BEEN
HITTING AROUND.

734
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,553
HE'S HAD ENOUGH.

735
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,971
DON'T YOU?

736
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,182
I'M GOING TO HATE LOSING DANNY

737
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,600
BECAUSE I LOVE
HIS LITTLE ONE-LINERS.

738
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,726
>> SO DO I.

739
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,894
>> I MEAN, I DO.

740
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,562
>> SO YOU THINK THAT'S
WHO YOU'LL VOTE FOR?

741
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,354
>> YEAH.

742
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,898
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT COACH
PUT DOWN

743
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:38,359
AND I THINK COACH WAS SENDING
A MESSAGE TO US

744
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,529
TO VOTE
THE NEXT WEAKEST LINK OUT.

745
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,035
>> HONESTLY I THINK WE'LL KEEP
DAN AROUND AFTER TODAY.

746
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,411
HE ALWAYS SITS OUT.

747
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,038
>> WE HAVE TO.

748
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,039
WE HAVE TO.

749
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,081
IT'S CRITICAL.

750
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,708
HE'S OUR SWING VOTE.

751
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,084
>> I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT
28 MORE DAYS OF THIS IN ME.

752
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,754
>> JUST TAKE IT ONE DAY
AT A TIME.

753
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,089
TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME.

754
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,511
BUT JIMMY T.
FOR SURE, RIGHT?

755
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,054
CORRECT?

756
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,222
>> WHATEVER YOU SAY.

757
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,681
>> WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON TYRONE,
OKAY?

758
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,891
THAT'S THE KEY, RIGHT?

759
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,934
>> I'LL TALK TO HIM.

760
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,852
>> THE MAIN THING IS THAT
DANNY DOES NOT GO HOME.

761
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,395
I TRIED TO DRILL THAT INTO JILL.

762
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,563
I THINK SHE GETS IT.

763
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,857
DO I WISH DANNY WAS STRONGER
AND BETTER?

764
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,401
IT WOULD BE GREAT
BUT AFTER TONIGHT

765
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,070
PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND IT
DOESN'T MATTER

766
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,613
WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY ABOUT
WHETHER DANNY'S WEAK

767
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,864
AND WHY AM I PROTECTING HIM.

768
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,406
>> STUFF'S TOO WET.

769
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,033
>> IT WILL BE NUMBERS.

770
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,201
NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES

771
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,537
AND THE NUMBERS WILL DICTATE
THE OUTCOME

772
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,830
OF THE NEXT THREE TRIBALS
AND I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON HIM.

773
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,082
I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON HIM.

774
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:34,916
>> HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

775
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,960
>> WOULD YOU STOP?

776
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,294
>> CAN YOU HELP ME UNTIE
THE SHOES?

777
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,213
>> JIMMY T.
DRIVES US ALL CRAZY.

778
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,882
HE DRIVES EVERYBODY CRAZY
IN CAMP.

779
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,092
IT'S JUST...
IT'S ANNOYING AS ALL HELL

780
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,928
AND IF I DON'T HAVE
TO LISTEN TO HIM

781
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,097
AT ANY MORE TRIBAL COUNCILS,
IT WILL BE A BLESSING.

782
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,056
>> I DON'T KNOW.

783
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,977
IT'S A TOSSUP BETWEEN DANNY
AND JIMMY T.

784
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,729
>> IF I'D GIVE YOU MY DRUTHERS
I'D PICK JIMMY T.

785
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,733
>> OKAY, GIVEN MY DRUTHERS
I'D PICK DAN

786
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,943
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS...

787
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,611
EVERYTHING REQUIRES SOMETHING.

788
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,904
DAN'S HAVING A HARD TIME
WALKING.

789
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,613
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

790
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,155
I HELP HIM THROUGH EVERYTHING.

791
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,449
YEAH, HE'S A GREAT GUY

792
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,077
AND HE'S STILL GOING TO BE
A GREAT GUY BUT YOU'RE NOT...

793
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,620
YOU KNOW,
HELPING OUR CAUSE RIGHT NOW.

794
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,830
>> RIGHT.

795
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,665
>> HONESTLY, I WANT DAN
TO GO BUT HE'S...

796
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,251
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
FOR A STRONG TEAM

797
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,086
BUT HE'S INTRINSIC
TO MY ALLIANCE

798
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,963
SO I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THAT.

799
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,465
I MEAN, I LOVE DAN BUT HE'S
DEFINITELY THE GUY

800
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,968
WHO SITS EVERY GAME
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

801
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,136
>> DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

802
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,137
>> HE WANTS DAN.

803
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,179
>> HE WANTS WHAT?

804
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,306
>> DAN. HE THINKS DAN'S WEAK.

805
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,849
HE'S ALL ABOUT A STRONG TEAM.

806
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,101
I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN
SWING HIM SO I DON'T KNOW.

807
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,437
>> I DON'T WANT
TO VOTE DANNY OUT.

808
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,439
I'M TELLING YOU.

809
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,822
ARE YOU LEANING TOWARDS ONE
OR THE OTHER RIGHT NOW?

810
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,490
>> YEAH.

811
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,867
IT'S KIND OF CRAZY.

812
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,743
I DON'T KNOW.

813
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,995
I GUESS DANNY
WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT.

814
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,830
HIS KNEES,
HE CAN'T RUN IN THE MUD.

815
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,040
EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN

816
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,666
IN THE MUD TO SOME DEGREE,
YOU KNOW?

817
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,500
>> A LITTLE BIT,
YEAH, I HEAR YOU.

818
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,046
I JUST THINK SOMETIMES
THERE'S THINGS

819
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,006
THAT ARE JUST WRONG,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

820
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,508
IT'S LIKE A CANCER.

821
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,470
TO BE HONEST, RIGHT NOW
I'D RATHER HAVE JIMMY T. GONE.

822
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,640
AND I FEEL PRETTY STRONGLY
ABOUT HAVING SOMEBODY

823
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,850
THAT'S THAT VOLATILE
AND THAT LOOSE.

824
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:19,187
AND IT'S PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES
OF MY PATIENCE

825
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,731
BUT, UM, YEAH, HIS PLEA,

826
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,191
HIS BIGGEST FEEDBACK
AFTER THE CHALLENGE TODAY

827
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,193
WAS THAT HE WANTS
TO BE THE LEADER,

828
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,694
BASICALLY, IS WHAT HE'S SAYING.

829
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,528
THE GUY'S A TRAIN WRECK.

830
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,697
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE COULD LEAD ANYTHING.

831
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,115
>> YEAH.

832
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,409
>> ALL I WANT IS A SHOT
AT ONE CHALLENGE.

833
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,370
ONE SHOT; ONE CHALLENGE.

834
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,245
THAT'S ALL.

835
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,498
I DON'T WANT TO BE LEADER.

836
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,999
>> WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
DONE DIFFERENTLY?

837
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,168
>> I'M NOT SAYING I WOULD HAVE
DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENT

838
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,711
OR I COULD HAVE WON TODAY.

839
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,713
I JUST WOULD HAVE LIKED
THE OPPORTUNITY.

840
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,173
THE QUESTION IS
WHY AREN'T I GETTING THE CHANCE?

841
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,093
WHY IS EVERYBODY SAYING HEY,
LET ME GET A CHANCE.

842
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,552
NO, NO, NO.

843
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,804
WHY IS THAT?

844
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,515
>> YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES SILENCE
IS A LITTLE BIT MORE POWERFUL

845
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,434
THAN SPEAKING
AND IT'S A SOCIAL GAME, TOO,

846
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,895
AND I KNOW J.T. APPEARS VERBALLY

847
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,230
TO BE SECURE BUT HE'S INSECURE.

848
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,732
>> I'VE GOT TO BE ME.

849
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,235
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO SAY
"PLEASE CAN I HAVE MY CHANCE?"

850
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,237
>> AND WHEN SOMEONE
OF THAT STATURE

851
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,782
AND THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT
DOESN'T TRUST HE'S ENOUGH,

852
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,701
IS HE...

853
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,119
I CAN'T TRUST HE'S GOING
TO BE ENOUGH DOWN THE ROAD.

854
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,454
>> ANYWAY, THANKS FOR LISTENING.

855
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,872
I...

856
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,249
SEND ME YOUR THERAPY BILL

857
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,166
AND I APPRECIATE YOU HEARING ME.

858
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,752
>> I'M A MOTHER

859
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,295
AND I DON'T CODDLE MY KIDS
THAT MUCH.

860
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,552
>> YOU NEVER KNOW IN THIS GAME.

861
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,303
I'M SCARED IT MIGHT BE ME
BECAUSE I KEEP OPENING MY MOUTH.

862
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,264
I'M GETTING A LITTLE MESSY.

863
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,099
CAN YOU PASS ME THE NAPKINS,
PLEASE?

864
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,267
BUT OF COURSE EVERY TIME
I OPEN MY MOUTH

865
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,104
ABOUT "PUT ME IN, COACH"
IT FALLS ON DEAF EARS.

866
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,313
THEY DON'T TALK MUCH TO ME.

867
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,940
I GET VERY LITTLE OUT OF THEM.

868
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,233
THAT'S WHAT FEEDS MY FUEL

869
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,278
OF FEELING LIKE I'M ALL ALONE
ON A PLANET HERE.

870
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,948
IT'S A TOUGH GROUP OF PEOPLE
TO GET ALONG WITH.

871
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:57,160
AND I'M EASY TO GET ALONG WITH,
I THINK.

872
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,972
>> Jeff: TYRONE, LET'S TALK
ABOUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

873
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,140
WHAT HAPPENED?

874
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,392
>> TODAY WE WENT WITH OUR PLAN.

875
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,227
WORKED OUT WELL.

876
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,645
I THINK THE MEDALLION
OF POWER...

877
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,855
>> Jeff: WAIT.

878
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,315
YOUR PLAN FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
WORKED OUT WELL?

879
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,277
>> WELL, PROVIDED THE MEDALLION
OF POWER WASN'T IN THE PLAY

880
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,654
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGE.

881
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,823
>> Jeff: MARTY, IS THAT
YOUR TAKE AS WELL?

882
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,658
>> YEAH, WE HAD ONE MORE ITEM
TO GO,

883
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,327
THEY HAD TWO TO START OUT WITH
SO AT THE VERY LEAST

884
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,538
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CLOSE MATCH
OR WE COULD HAVE HAD A LEG UP.

885
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,499
>> Jeff: TO BE CLEAR,
YOU HAD ONE MORE ITEM,

886
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,459
A SET OF KEYS, A CHEST,

887
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,835
THREE LOCKS AND GETTING IT BACK.

888
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,795
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

889
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,671
IT'S BEHIND US;
WE'VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD.

890
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,672
FIXING WHAT WE CAN AT CAMP,

891
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,342
THAT'S THE MENTAL ATTITUDE
YOU HAVE TO HAVE.

892
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,719
>> Jeff: DAN, YOU SAT
OUT OF THE CHALLENGE YET AGAIN.

893
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,305
>> I TOLD EVERYBODY ON THE TRIBE

894
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,349
THAT I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE

895
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,851
BECAUSE OF MY KNEE SLOSHING
AROUND IN MUD.

896
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,979
IF YOU PUT ME ON LEVEL GROUND,
I'LL GO UP AGAINST ANYBODY.

897
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,231
BUT WHY WOULD I WANT
TO DO SOMETHING

898
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,275
THAT I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD AT
AND POSSIBLY HURT THE TRIBE?

899
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,236
>> Jeff: NO, I WOULDN'T EITHER.

900
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,364
BUT WHEN YOU COME
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL SAYING

901
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,198
"I CAN'T GO BECAUSE IT'S MUDDY"

902
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,700
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE RAIN FOREST,

903
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,702
YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE WORRIED

904
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,830
THAT MAYBE
I'M JUST TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN.

905
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,248
>> ABSOLUTELY.

906
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,541
YEAH, MAYBE I AM.

907
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,000
>> Jeff: DO YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE?

908
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,126
>> NO.

909
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,879
IF I THINK I'M MAKING THE PROPER
CHOICE OF SITTING DOWN,

910
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,381
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

911
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,883
I DON'T WANT TO HURT THE TRIBE.

912
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,846
>> Jeff: JILL, HOW MUCH
DOES THAT FACTOR IN FOR YOU

913
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,056
WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT WHO TO VOTE OUT TONIGHT?

914
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:42,890
>> IT'S...

915
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,059
IT FACTORS IN A LOT
IN MY THINKING.

916
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,853
I MEAN, I KNOW EVERYONE'S
KIND OF LIKE,

917
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,229
RAH, RAH, WE DID OUR BEST,
BUT I'M TIRED OF LOSING.

918
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,438
I'M NOT USED TO LOSING.

919
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,399
I DON'T LIKE IT.

920
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,733
WE'VE GONE
THROUGH AN N.F.L. COACH

921
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,402
AND ALL THIS STUFF

922
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,903
AND WE'RE STILL NOT
WINNING CHALLENGES

923
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,405
AND IT'S BUGGING ME.

924
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,323
>> Jeff: JIMMY T., JILL MENTIONS

925
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,534
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
AN N.F.L. COACH, GOT RID OF HIM.

926
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,203
HOW FRUSTRATING IS THAT
TO NOT HAVE LEADERSHIP?

927
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,454
>> RIGHT.

928
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,706
THE SHIP IS GOING DOWN.

929
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,875
WE KEEP COMING BACK HERE
VOTING GUYS OUT,

930
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,501
SO WHY DON'T WE TRY
MIXING IT UP?

931
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,420
>> Jeff: AND "MIXING IT UP"
WOULD MEAN WHAT?

932
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,421
>> EVERYBODY KNOWS
I'VE BEEN VOCAL

933
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,633
IN WANTING ONE OPPORTUNITY
TO LEAD THE TRIBE

934
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,302
IN AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,

935
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,888
BUT I CONTINUE TO BE
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL

936
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,097
THAT DOESN'T GET THE OIL.

937
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,807
>> Jeff: MARTY,
WHY NOT GIVE JIMMY T. A SHOT?

938
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,933
ARE YOU OPEN TO IT?

939
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,436
>> NOT NECESSARILY, NO.

940
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,271
I MEAN, I THINK AS A TRIBE,

941
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,815
WE THOUGHT THAT TYRONE SHOULD BE
THE GUY CALLING THE SHOTS.

942
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,483
I DON'T THINK
IT'S ALWAYS NECESSARILY

943
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,443
SOME INCREDIBLE
LEADERSHIP QUALITY.

944
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,487
I MEAN, WE HAD JIMMY JOHNSON
FOR... SAKE.

945
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,281
IT DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THAT

946
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,699
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LEADERSHIP.

947
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,660
YOU'VE GOT
A STRESSFUL SITUATION HERE.

948
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:48,915
THERE IS ZERO TOLERANCE
FOR PARANOIA,

949
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,125
DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR,

950
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,627
POPPING OFF.

951
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,504
EVERYONE RIGHT NOW IS TRYING
TO BE AS PATIENT AS POSSIBLE,

952
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,505
BUT IT'S BEEN STRETCHED
TO THE LIMIT.

953
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,966
>> JEFF, I'M OFFERING.

954
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,551
THEY DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT,
THAT'S FINE.

955
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,971
BUT WHAT KIND OF SUCCESS IS
ESPADA TRIBE HAVING RIGHT NOW?

956
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:04,388
>> Jeff: VERY LITTLE.

957
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,849
>> CASE CLOSED.

958
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,558
>> YOU KNOW,
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

959
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,352
ALL HE'S ASKING FOR IS A CHANCE.

960
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,146
LET HIM TRY.

961
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,522
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
THE SIXTH PERSON ON THE BENCH

962
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,233
DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY
AS THE FIRST PERSON ON THE BENCH

963
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,818
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE?

964
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,945
THAT'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.

965
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,323
>> LISTEN, I'M A VALUABLE
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE TRIBE.

966
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,824
I PROVIDE FOOD.

967
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,952
I TRY TO PROVIDE COMFORT,

968
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,454
BUT EVIDENTLY THEY DON'T SEE ME
THE SAME LIGHT I SEE ME.

969
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:33,167
>> Jeff: TYRONE, IF YOU BELIEVED
JIMMY T. COULD CHANGE,

970
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,169
IF YOU BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE,

971
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:37,213
WOULD HE HAVE VALUE
TO THE TRIBE?

972
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,714
>> YEAH. HE HAS VALUE NOW

973
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,508
AS IT IS EVEN THOUGH
HE'S NOT A FOLLOWER.

974
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,052
HE WOULD HAVE MORE VALUE
IF HE WAS,

975
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,345
YOU KNOW, ABLE TO BE A FOLLOWER.

976
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,806
>> Jeff: OKAY. SO JIMMY T.,

977
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,683
ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT
THE ROLE

978
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,018
THAT THIS TRIBE CLEARLY
WANTS YOU TO HAVE,

979
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,354
WHICH IS AS A FOLLOWER,
NOT A LEADER?

980
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,232
>> I'M MAN ENOUGH.

981
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:56,649
I BELIEVE I'M MAN ENOUGH.

982
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,235
AND MAYBE...

983
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,403
MAYBE THEY DON'T BELIEVE SO,

984
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,529
BUT I'M MAN ENOUGH
TO TAKE MY ROLE

985
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,031
AND TAKE SOME GOOD ADVICE.

986
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,535
>> Jeff: IS THIS HARD?

987
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,203
>> VERY HARD FOR ME.

988
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:12,373
>> Jeff: WHY DOES IT HURT
SO MUCH?

989
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,669
I CAN SEE YOU'RE EMOTIONAL.

990
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,505
>> GIVE ME A MINUTE.

991
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:26,012
>> I SAY TAKE THIS
AS AN OPPORTUNITY

992
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,015
TO HAVE THE COURAGE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT,

993
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,517
HEY, MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT I CAN DO

994
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,395
TO BE A BETTER ME
AND MOVE FORWARD FROM THERE.

995
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,439
>> Jeff: JIMMY T.,
FROM ALL GUYS,

996
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,900
TYRONE EXTENDING
THE OLIVE BRANCH.

997
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,527
>> I THINK THEY KNOW
I'M A MAN OF HONOR.

998
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,739
I KNOW I'M A MAN OF HONOR
AND INTEGRITY.

999
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,241
IF I SAY I'M GOING SOMETHING,
I'M GONNA HONOR THAT.

1000
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,909
SO I'LL STEP DOWN AND SAY

1001
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,245
I'LL JUST BE A WORKER BEE
FOR THIS TRIBE

1002
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:53,247
AND A GOOD WORKER BEE
AND NOBODY CAN DENY THAT.

1003
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,542
>> Jeff: WELL,
A LOT HAS BEEN SAID

1004
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,710
AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1005
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,880
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW WILL IT IMPACT THE VOTE?

1006
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,298
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1007
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,341
HOLLY, YOU'RE UP.

1008
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,310
>> SORRY ABOUT YOUR SHOES,

1009
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,436
BUT YOU SAT OUT TWO CHALLENGES.

1010
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,480
YOU'RE THE WEAK ONE ON THE TEAM.

1011
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,523
YOU NEED TO GO.

1012
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,880
>> SEE YA, PAL.

1013
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,730
