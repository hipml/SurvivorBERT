00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,888
JEFF PROBST:<i> We are making our</i>
<i>way upriver along the Rio Negro</i>

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,099
<i>in northern Brazil,</i>
<i>where the temperature is</i>

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,436
<i>a scorching 103 degrees</i>
<i>and these 16 Americans</i>

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,522
<i>are set to begin</i>
<i>the adventure of a lifetime.</i>

5
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,108
They're about to be abandoned
in the middle of the largest

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,445
and most magnificent tropical
rainforest in the world:

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,529
the Amazon.

8
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>Spanning two and a half</i>
<i>million miles,</i>

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,494
<i>the Amazon is responsible</i>
<i>for 15% of the world's oxygen</i>

10
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,997
<i>and is the world's largest</i>
<i>freshwater source.</i>

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,292
<i>For much of the season,</i>
<i>the Amazon is a flooded forest,</i>

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,253
<i>a land covered by</i>
<i>up to 60 feet of water.</i>

13
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,381
<i>But as the dry season emerges,</i>
<i>the river subsides,</i>

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,259
<i>revealing the dangers</i>
<i>that lurk beneath:</i>

15
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,137
<i>caiman crocodiles,</i>
<i>schools of piranha,</i>

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,015
<i>and the world's most</i>
<i>feared snake: the anaconda.</i>

17
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,643
(thunder rumbling)

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,438
<i>Soon, torrential thunderstorms</i>
<i>will arrive,</i>

19
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,522
<i>rocking this jungle</i>

20
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,858
<i>and submerging the forest</i>
<i>once again.</i>

21
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,653
This will be their home
for the next 39 days.

22
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,992
<i>It is the ultimate challenge.</i>

23
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:18,995
<i>16 strangers, all from</i>
<i>different walks of life,</i>

24
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,831
<i>left to fend for themselves,</i>
<i>utilizing the resources</i>

25
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,959
<i>of the land and their own</i>
<i>survival skills;</i>

26
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,879
forced to work together
to create a new society

27
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,174
<i>while battling the elements</i>
<i>and each other.</i>

28
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,718
They must learn to adapt, or
they'll be voted from the tribe.

29
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,012
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>only one will remain</i>

30
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,014
<i>to claim</i>
<i>the million-dollar prize.</i>

31
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:48,149
39 days, 16 people,
one Survivor.

32
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,761
PROBST:
<i>Okay, guys.</i>

33
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,929
<i>Traveled a long way upriver.</i>

34
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,598
<i>Now it's time to find out</i>

35
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,057
<i>who your tribemates</i>
<i>are going to be.</i>

36
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,978
As I call out your name,

37
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,563
want you to climb down
the rope ladder

38
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,898
and get in the yellow boat.

39
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,024
Jeanne.

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,325
Heidi.

HEIDI:<i> When Jeff called</i>

00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,936
<i>This is an all-woman tribe.</i>

47
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:48,811
Whoo!

48
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,022
-(excited chatter)
-Come on, Shawna.

49
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:51,940
Deena.

50
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,903
Janet.

51
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,365
Shawna.

52
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:04,118
Once you guys are on board,
you can introduce yourselves,

53
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,120
celebrate your fellow members.

54
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,122
(laughter, excited chatter)

55
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,123
Woo-hoo!

56
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,500
DEENA:<i> I was absolutely</i>
<i>just overjoyed</i>

57
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,460
<i>that it was</i>
<i>an all-female tribe.</i>

58
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,296
<i>It's an all-chick thing.</i>

59
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,756
We can let our hair down.

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,549
We can pee
in front of each other.

61
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,677
<i>I'm on an equal playing field,</i>

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,470
<i>because I have seven other</i>

63
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:26,849
Men, as I call out your name,
climb down the rope ladder,

00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,351

ROGER:<i> It's gonna be the men</i>

67
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,065
<i>But they don't have</i>
<i>the strength.</i>

68
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,858
They may have the will.

69
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,027
But, you know--
and this is a forbidden place.

70
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,070
<i>It's pathetic.</i>

71
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,113

00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,763
Dave.

80
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,181
DANIEL:<i> All the guys</i>
<i>were really pumped up.</i>

81
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:11,185
<i>There is no way that women are</i>
<i>going to beat us in anything--</i>

82
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,855
physical, mentally or whatever.

83
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,190
<i>We're never going to go</i>
<i>to Tribal Council.</i>

84
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,234
Tribal Council? We ain't
going to Tribal Council.

85
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,403
JENNA:
<i>They're so freakin' cocky.</i>

86
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,779
<i>They're, like, "Oh, we're never</i>

87
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,488
going to go to Tribal Council."

88
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,867
And, ugh, it's just so annoying.

89
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,245
I just want to beat them to just
kind of, like, shut them up.

90
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,414
PROBST:
All right, guys.

91
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,126
Just want to tell you guys a
quick story about how the Amazon

92
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,252
got its name.

93
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:39,756
This place was discovered
in 1541, Spanish explorer.

94
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,425
While he's making his way
through here, he encounters

95
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,595
a tribe of very fierce,
very courageous female warriors.

96
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,765
-(women cheer, chuckle)
-Women only.

97
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,267
This was the first notion
that women could survive

98
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,769
just fine on their own.

99
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,023
So he named the Amazon
after these female warriors.

100
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,193
That is where the term
"Amazon women" comes from.

101
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,945
So, it is only fitting
that for the first time,

102
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,946
while we're here in the Amazon,

103
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,117
we have a tribe of women
versus a tribe of men.

104
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,952
(cheering, applause)

105
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,997
Ladies, your tribe name is

106
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,416
"Jaburu," after the bird.

107
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,751
Pass out your buffs.

108
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,752
-Whoo!
-Jaburu!

109
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,129
Men, your tribe name:

110
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,798
"Tambaqui," after the fish.

111
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,092
Here are your buffs.

112
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,343
Maps to your new home.

113
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,598
Some very meager supplies
are awaiting you guys.

114
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,475
Ladies, you will begin by
heading left around the bend.

115
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,853
Men, you will go out right.

116
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,232
Look for your tribe flags
at your new home.

117
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,108
Shove off!

118
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,859
(excited chatter)

119
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,246
SHAWNA:
<i>I just got up there.</i>

120
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,457
<i>And my brain was</i>
<i>so jumpy that I just</i>

121
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,334
<i>couldn't even untie a boat.</i>

122
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,810
<i>And I just felt so stupid.</i>

123
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,187
The guys going off one way,
the girls couldn't untie--

124
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,522
well, I couldn't untie the knot.

125
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,278
(men chattering)

126
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,365
Hey, guys, guys, guys,
guys, look.

127
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,159
You know, it's only
gonna be light for probably

128
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,368
-another five hours.
-Let's rocket, guys.

129
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,496
We better damn well have us
a fire, you know what I mean?

130
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,622
RYAN:
<i>All the strategy I had,</i>

131
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,833
<i>it was taken</i>
<i>and thrown all out the window.</i>

132
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,501
<i>It sucks when you have</i>
<i>a game plan</i>

133
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,170
<i>that you, like,</i>
<i>know that'll work.</i>

134
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,714
And now it's like,
I got eight guys

135
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,842
and it's all one big
sausage fest, you know?

136
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,844
One, two, three.

137
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,555
Hup, two, three.
Hup, two, three.

138
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,058
Hup, two, three. Hup...

139
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,232
Well, we're all trying to act
like it's not a big deal...

140
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,903
(indistinct voices)

141
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,279
Janet, what do you do?

142
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,031
I'm a nurse.

143
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,533
And I'm trained
in emergency medicine.

144
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,410
-Yeah!
-(cheering)

145
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,745
And I... and I've done
medical missions out...

146
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,581
JENNA:<i> Stranded in the jungle</i>
<i>with seven other women--</i>

147
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,624
<i>is my worst nightmare.</i>

148
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,750
<i>If you're on a tribe</i>
<i>with all women,</i>

149
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:26,088
you can't use any of
your womanly powers on women.

150
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,216
They could care less.
They find that insulting.

151
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,302
With men, it's just,
you can manipulate them better.

152
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,720
(laughter, chattering)

153
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,097
Exactly!

154
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,390
Oh!

155
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,392
That was the worst.

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,985
-Oh, there it is.
-Is that it?

157
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,946
No, right there.
Almost dead ahead.

158
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,447
-Oh, yeah.
-Whoo!

159
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,574
-(cheering)
-Yeah!

160
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,867
Go straight ahead, guys.

161
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,285
We got to get across.
Let's go.

162
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,286
Let's get there.

163
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,579
The minute we saw our flag,

164
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,956
we beelined it
right to the shore.

165
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,791
<i>You know, I think we're all</i>
<i>excited, um, to keep going,</i>

<i>the shelter,</i>

167
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,295
<i>start getting a fire.</i>

168
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,838
-Up a little.
-You got it.

169
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,131
Yeah!

170
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:09,757
-Whoo!
-(cheering)

171
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,009
Yeah!

172
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,594
-All right.
-That was easy.

173
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,136
Yeah, where's
our meager supplies?

174
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,971
Our meager supplies are

175
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,099
right up, right up there
in that box.

176
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,517
Ready, guys?

177
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,601
All right.

178
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,311
-Tambaqui.
-Tambaqui!

179
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,604
ALL:
Tambaqui!

180
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,106
-(cheering)
-Yeah!

181
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,148
-All right, guys.
-All right.

182
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,316
-How you open this?
-Break it open.

183
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,359
Crack... crack this baby open.

184
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,445
Look, while we're all here,
man, I think, uh,

185
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,366
I think Roger said something
that was, uh, really important

186
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,451
early on we should make sure
we capitalize on.

187
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,120
That's that, you know,
we're all, we're all

188
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:39,829
freakin' men of pride,
men of honor, whatnot.

189
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,831
(chuckles)

190
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,208
-And right now, baby...
-Tell it!

191
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:44,792
...yo, we're the favorites
right now.

192
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,877
Straight up, you know?

193
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,505
Physically, we're so much
more adept.

194
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,507
Um, we got everything
riding on this.

195
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,758
We'd look like the biggest ass
ever if we go home.

196
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,677
Wait, wait, bottom line, bottom
line is we're not going home

197
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,971
if we lose, 'cause we can't.

198
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:57,972
RYAN:
<i>Bottom line is</i>

199
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,348
a lot of girls over there are

200
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,559
eye candy, and that,
and that's great to look at.

201
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,019
I appreciate look at them.

202
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,478
Thank you for wearing bikinis.

203
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,356
But when it comes down to it,
I mean, it's--

204
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,358
you want people
that are gonna be useful.

205
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,693
<i>Our butts are</i>
<i>on the stove right now.</i>

206
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,487
<i>If we lose to the girls,</i>
<i>I mean, it's gonna be rough.</i>

207
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,323
<i>It's gonna be really rough.</i>

208
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,991
-Keep it real, man.
-Oh.

209
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:17,992
-All right.
-We got to remember...

210
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,202
-Yeah, careful, guys.
-You got to be careful.

211
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,913
Be careful with these machetes,
all right?

212
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,333
They can kill you.

213
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,917
-Here, why don't you just...
-Let's just go ahead

214
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,586
-and start getting that out.
-See what we got here.

215
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,295
ROGER:
<i>We open the box,</i>

216
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,672
and lo and behold, in the box,

217
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,133
there's the five gallons
of fresh water,

218
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:34,842
<i>there were fish hooks.</i>

219
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,887
Fishing line and hooks.

220
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,389
<i>There was kerosene,</i>

221
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,099
<i>two lanterns.</i>

222
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,559
There was a flint.

223
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,062
That's good to know.

224
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,271
What's this?

225
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,522
Um, something we don't
have a key...

226
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,899
ALEX:
<i>We have a mystery box.</i>

227
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,276
We have a box that had
a note on it that said...

228
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,236
"Do not open till
instructed...

229
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,614
A key will appear
when you least expect it."

230
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,656
All right.

231
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,617
So I don't know what that means.

232
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,410
Um, but--
so we, so we don't know

233
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,578
what's in the mystery box yet.

234
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,954
Look at all this.

235
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:04,997
Manioc flour.

236
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,873
<i>We got a big thing</i>
<i>of manioc flour,</i>

237
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,916
<i>and that stuff's actually</i>

238
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,086
got some pretty good
nutritional value, some--

239
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:10,920
lots of carbohydrates and can
keep us going for a while.

240
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,589
And we got a huge thing of it.

241
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,716
All right, let's huddle up.

242
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,926
Let's, let's have
a group huddle.

243
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,260
Everybody get together.

244
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,261
Let's, let's get calm.

245
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,263
Let's get our machetes.

246
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,558
So cool. My parents would
never let me have a machete.

247
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,227
(chuckles)

248
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,654
HEIDI:
<i>We were paddling away,</i>

249
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,281
<i>and, uh, we finally see</i>
<i>the yellow flag.</i>

250
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:39,990
All right!

251
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,620
I was so excited, so excited.

252
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,789
How we going to get up?

253
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,581
We can get out right here.

254
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,043
I got the slipknot right
this time.

255
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,128
(chuckling)

256
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:52,795
-All right.
-Very nice, ladies.

257
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,131
Very good. Very good.

258
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,758
(whooping)

259
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,178
All right, you guys, can I just

260
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:01,846
-let you guys know something?
-Yeah.

261
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,599
Um, I-- it's not a big deal,

262
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,185
but I think it's something that
every tribe member should know,

263
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,437
and I want to try to do my best

264
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,980
to keep it from
the other tribe members,

265
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,274
but I am deaf.

266
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,108
I can't hear.

267
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,651
I have a hearing aid
in my one ear.

268
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,112
Um, can't hear anything
out of this ear.

269
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,822
Um, I read lips.
Um, nighttime...

270
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,657
JANET:<i> Christy has</i>
<i>a hearing disability.</i>

271
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,119
<i>It took us by surprise, but she</i>
<i>just asked us to look at her</i>

272
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,954
and speak slowly
so she could read our lips.

273
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,291
You know, when we were on the
boat and everyone was talking,

274
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,460
I have, like, no idea
what your jobs are.

275
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,504
I have no idea what your names
are or where you guys live.

276
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,672
-Deena.
-Deena?

277
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,715
-Deena.
-Hi, Deena.

278
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,717
-Jeanne.
-Jeanne.

279
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,511
CHRISTY:<i> I kind of told them</i>
<i>at the wrong time,</i>

280
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,513
but I needed to get it
off my chest.

281
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,683
Like I just couldn't, like,
keep it in any longer.

282
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,142
-Heidi.
-Heidi.

283
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,435
-Jenna.
-Jenna.

284
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,730
JENNA:<i> I'm just wondering</i>
<i>how she's going to be able</i>

285
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,025
<i>to work with a group when</i>
<i>she can't really hear well.</i>

286
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,068
-I'm Janet.
-Jan.

287
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,696
I don't know how it's going
to work out, I really don't.

288
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,864
Well, that's all.

289
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,406
I just kind of wanted...

290
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,532
No, that's important.

291
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,160
-I'm glad you told us
right off the bat. -I know.

292
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,912
We promise not to tell
the boys anything.

293
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,624
Let's see if we've got any food.
Is anybody else...?

294
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,846
Yeah, we want to be quite a ways
from the water.

295
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,556
The higher up we go-- what do
you guys think about that?

296
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,474
I'm asking your opinion.

297
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,226
That pretty much agree
with everybody?

298
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,228
The higher up we go,
better off we are, too?

299
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,396
Not... well, but we also want
to be able to get to water.

300
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,065
How about if we walk around
and then we come back

301
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,733
and share opinions,
you know, so--

302
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,527
Nobody wants to be a leader
'cause that's the first guy

303
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,736
gets voted off, right?

304
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,779
(laughter)

305
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,822
So, why don't we come back--

306
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,074
And here I am saying that. Uh...

307
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,576
ROB:<i> Maybe you think</i>
<i>you meet a guy named Butch</i>

308
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,579
<i>from Illinois that's a redneck.</i>

309
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,207
You think he's not
that sharp a guy, but he is.

310
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,458
I like Butch a lot.

311
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,421
ALEX:
<i>We found a great spot.</i>

312
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,715
We found a pretty, you know,
relatively level spot

313
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,217
on a little bit higher ground.

314
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,303
What if we would use
those two trees

315
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,263
as the back part of your hut

316
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,890
and bring something across?
I don't know...

317
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,892
ALEX: We don't even need
to bring anything across.

318
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,768
We can just clear that branch.

319
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,228
It's already cleared, too, guys.

320
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,896
ALEX:<i> And, actually, there's a</i>
<i>little bit of a slope, too,</i>

321
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,482
to where we are,
so the water won't-won't

322
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,900
puddle up where we are.

323
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,068
-So we got to get these logs
out. -Right.

324
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,612
Let's not get everybody
doing it, though, you know?

325
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,323
Two of us are going to go do
the fire situation.

326
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,616
I think probably...

327
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,243
Well, two can start clearing,

328
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,287
two can start, uh,
trying to find palms for...

329
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,247
Well, actually, you know what?
We don't need to

330
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,540
do that till tomorrow.
We just need a floor.

331
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,124
-Alex, tonight, we're only going
to get a platform. -Yeah, we...

332
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,750
-Okay?
-Let's do it.

333
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,876
We got trees right here
that'll work.

334
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,604
That's good.

335
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,987
It's all good
in the neighborhood.

336
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,489
It's all gravy, baby.

337
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,826
I feel I missed my calling
in life as a lumberjack.

338
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,828
Tell me if this is not kerosene.

339
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,788
That's kerosene;
I can smell it from here.

340
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,875
Okay, yeah, 'cause my smeller
is gone; I can't tell you.

341
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,667
Yeah. Whew.

342
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,419
You can tell by,
you can tell by...

343
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,379
-By the crossbones, yeah.
-(laughter)

344
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,883
DAVE:<i> Making the fire</i>
<i>was-was a piece of cake.</i>

345
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:26,592
The reason being
is that there was

346
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,843
kerosene in the, in the lamps.

347
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:31,889
<i>We were also given some flint</i>
<i>with the machetes</i>

348
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,849
<i>and had no problems</i>
<i>making a fire.</i>

349
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,851
-There you go.
-You got it, you got it.

350
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,353
Keep going, man.

351
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,854
-There you go. Perfect
-Turn it.

352
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:41,190
Yeah. Toss that right on top.

353
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,025
Nice. Nice.

354
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,860
I wonder if the chicks
have built their fire yet.

355
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:45,903
-I doubt it.
-Probably.

356
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,281
I don't smoke...

357
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,658
Come on, come on.
Somebody do something.

358
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,034
-Something.
-Here, here, here.

359
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,243
-Blow.
-Here, here.

360
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,870
I need one of those big leaves.

361
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:55,871
Let's just fan it.

362
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:56,872
I fanned it.

363
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,295
Yep.

364
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,172
Keep going.

365
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,725
We almost got it.

366
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,813
SHAWNA:<i> The fire was</i>
<i>an absolute fiasco.</i>

367
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,855
<i>The process was:</i>

368
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,525
get the little fire going,
put on some leaves,

369
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,068
some other small stuff,

370
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,487
put on little sticks,
put on bigger stuff,

371
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,822
put on big logs.

372
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,407
-I think it stopped.
-It's going out.

373
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,449
-(gasps)
-Yeah.

374
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,867
It's going out. Why?

375
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,327
-It's this stuff.
-Blow, blow.

376
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,745
SHAWNA:
<i>None of this happened.</i>

377
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,414
<i>It was ridiculous.</i>

378
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,375
Obviously, it's a lack of fire-
building skills on our part.

379
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,795
It's dead.

380
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,588
What is doing that?

381
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,425
Hey, guys, we need to have
a little team meeting.

382
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,719
We need to decide
what's really important

383
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,096
for this first night here,
on this bug-infested,

384
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,807
fly-infested,
wasp-infested area.

385
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,100
For me, it is something
to sleep on.

386
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,395
So how would you suggest
we do that?

387
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,896
HEIDI:
<i>Deena-- she definitely has</i>

388
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,480
<i>more of a bossy side to her.</i>

389
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,648
<i>Like, if six of us</i>

390
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,109
come up with a good idea,
she would be the one to say,

391
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,279
"I don't think that'll work;
we better do something else."

392
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,740
I don't want
to sleep on the floor.

393
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,657
We could split.

394
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,493
Just, like, half do fire,
half do shelter.

395
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,703
So let's split.

396
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,537
-Half will work on the fire...
-I'll work on the shelter.

397
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,706
and get the logs
ready for the fire--

398
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,750
the other half
work on the shelter?

399
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,917
-Yeah.
-Okay.

400
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,050
Timber. Clear.

401
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,473
It's stuck.

402
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,394
Ah...

403
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,647
JEANNE:
<i>It's okay.</i>

404
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,316
We're Amazon women.

405
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,317
We'll make it.

406
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,318
Go...

407
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,820
(grunts)

408
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,864
Oh, my God.

409
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,908
<i>We'll toughen up and we'll</i>
<i>make it through to the end.</i>

410
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,702
Kick the guys' butt.

411
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,213
RYAN: Hey, guys, what do you
think of our bed, dude?

412
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,340
All right.

413
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,050
Hey, that looks a...

414
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,968
-That looks pretty damn
comfortable. -Look at the bed!

415
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,386
How is it?

416
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,514
Not... not bad.

417
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,182
Butch has got his...

418
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,476
Here's my, um,
here's my thing that I got.

419
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,185
And it, it, uh--
I wanted to explain it to you,

420
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,395
'cause it's kind of corny.

421
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,481
Uh, I'm in the kid business,
and I have--

422
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,607
I deal with 500
middle school kids every day.

423
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,527
And I have a lot of kids
nowadays that are not like us.

424
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,528
They're not dreamers.

425
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,029
They have no goals.

426
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,031
And they just don't
believe in themselves.

427
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,991
So I had a banner
hanging up in my school,

428
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,201
and I brought the banner.

429
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,536
And it says, each one of us...

430
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,245
"Believe In Yourself."

431
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,747
-I'm down.
-Put it up!

432
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,624
DAVE:<i> Butch had</i>
<i>a fantastic luxury item.</i>

433
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,876
It's a fabulous motto, you know?

434
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,919
It's something to,

435
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,628
<i>to really think about.</i>

436
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,714
Hey, believe in yourself, right?

437
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,715
One, two, three...

438
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,967
ALL:
Believe in yourself!

439
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,093
-Hoorah!
-Believe in yourself.

440
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:56,760
Tambaqui.

441
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,221
-Tambaqui?
-It's Tambaqui!

442
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,765
If it rained, we could cover
the wood with this.

443
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,268
ROB:<i> I think, as a whole,</i>
<i>we've gotten along very well,</i>

444
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,563
but I think that the women
have got to be having

445
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,690
a very difficult time.

446
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,859
<i>And especially, they're not</i>
<i>going to catch any fish.</i>

447
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,860
<i>We got expert fishermen</i>
<i>out there</i>

448
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:13,944
<i>and we haven't</i>
<i>caught anything yet.</i>

449
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,406
<i>I don't think any of them</i>
<i>had any idea</i>

450
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,741
<i>they'd be doing this</i>
<i>on estrogen alone</i>

451
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,370
over there in, in, uh,
Camp of the Vagina Monologue.

452
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,915
By tomorrow night,
we'll be light-years ahead of

453
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,916
where they are.

454
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,419
There is no way
that that group collectively

455
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,420
is halfway where we are.

456
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,007
I just can't see it.

457
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,766
Blow on it.

458
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,476
Blow on it.

459
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,186
-There we go.
-All right.

460
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,063
Oh, you're a lifesaver
with this one.

461
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,691
DEENA:
<i>It took us five or six hours</i>

462
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,484
<i>to get the fire really going.</i>

463
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,236
<i>And by the time</i>
<i>it got pitch black,</i>

464
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,280
<i>we had really</i>
<i>only cut four logs.</i>

465
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,825
<i>So we all sat there</i>
<i>in front of the fire,</i>

466
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,994
which was now starting
to grow a little bit larger;

467
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,454
people were a little bit
more comfortable.

468
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,122
We lighted the kerosene
so it wouldn't be

469
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,290
quite so dark out there.

470
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,125
-What is that?
-What?

471
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,251
See it.

472
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,961
-What is it?
-It's a leaf.

473
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,171
See the shadow of the leaf?

474
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,297
No, go a little further.

475
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,298
I'm telling you.

476
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,175
It's the shadow of the leaf.

477
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,260
DEENA:<i> We huddled as close</i>
<i>to the fire as we could,</i>

478
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,845
<i>and we decided</i>
<i>that we were going to</i>

479
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,513
<i>watch the fire in shifts</i>
<i>that night.</i>

480
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,309
But all we did was a major
bag fest on the boy team

481
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,936
for most of the night.

482
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,021
-The boys are talking about...
-How they get off.

483
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,648
-(laughter)
-Oh!

484
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,982
What are they talking about?

485
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,651
They're talking about
how they can't believe

486
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,319
that you two aren't
in your bathing suits.

487
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,987
Did you notice the guys
staring at Heidi

488
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,322
when they got on the boat?

489
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:40,656
He was like--
it was, like, a long...

490
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,324
(laughter)

491
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,659
Just like, "No!

492
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,660
Don't take her from me."

493
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,703
"I wanted to look at
your hooters all day."

494
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,622
(laughter)

495
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,833
CHRISTY:
<i>As soon as it gets dark,</i>

496
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,004
<i>that's where my whole</i>
<i>communication just shuts down,</i>

497
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,339
<i>because I can't see.</i>

498
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,424
<i>I can't read their lips.</i>

499
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,139
<i>And it's, like, God, of course</i>

500
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,016
I'm in a group of girls
who like to

501
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,518
talk and talk and talk and talk,
you know?

502
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,354
So it's like...

503
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,232
So I'm missing out
on a lot of their information.

504
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,234
We want to eat,
or do we want a shelter?

505
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,903
I think we better eat, or
we're going to start collapsing.

506
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,113
CHRISTY:
<i>I'll try to be with them,</i>

507
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,532
<i>but I can never be like them</i>
<i>'cause I'm not.</i>

508
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,534
<i>I'm always totally different.</i>

509
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,869
<i>It always happens.</i>

510
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,080
That's okay. That's okay.

511
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,581
It happens every time.

512
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,626
It's just like,
I'm at a big disadvantage.

513
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,713
Oh, no!

514
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,715
I said, "No!
Are you out of your mind?"

515
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,260
I'm not eating someone else's,
like, order.

516
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,553
(chuckles)

517
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,054
Is Christy sleeping over there?

518
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,724
-Yeah, she is. She's out.
-Is she?

519
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,058
-Night, ladies.
-Good night.

520
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,727
-Good night.
-How you feeling?

521
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,371
JENNA:<i> The Amazon women tribe</i>
<i>is not doing very well.</i>

522
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,915
<i>We slept on the ground, which</i>
<i>is, like, the number one rule</i>

523
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,541
<i>not to do in the jungle.</i>

524
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,085
<i>And it was awful.</i>

525
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,420
<i>We had bugs</i>
<i>crawling all over us.</i>

526
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,588
<i>Something was always biting you</i>

527
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,258
or crawling down your pants
or crawling in your hair.

528
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:26,053
I don't like when they fly
directly into your eyeball.

529
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:26,595
Or right up your nose.
I had that this morning.

530
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,430
Yeah, I saw that.

531
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,059
JANET:
<i>There was leeches, big spiders.</i>

532
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,518
We all got bit.

533
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,938
Here, give me the machete.

534
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,773
Oh, my goodness.

535
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,608
I can't believe
that's right there,

536
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,609
and we've been
sleeping right there.

537
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,111
Maybe if we just leave it alone,
it'll go away.

538
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:43,695
No, I want it dead.

539
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,281
That's a reality check.

540
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,991
Last night,
that big spider dropped down.

541
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:48,992
Oh, you're right.

542
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,118
And it was something huge.

543
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,661
JENNA:<i> We found</i>
<i>a tarantula that morning.</i>

544
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,164
<i>It fell on someone that night.</i>

545
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,624
So, obviously, it probably
climbed over all of us.

546
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,666
Just get it.

547
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,585
It's in the food now, girls.

548
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,628
-Oh... -It went into our stuff;
that's what it's after.

549
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,963
Oh, he went into the food.

550
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,257
-Maybe the net.
-Is he in there? Really?

551
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,258
He's right there.

552
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,176
Oh, step away.

553
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,302
It's hollow though underneath.

554
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,096
-He's probably underneath it.
-Well, that's okay.

555
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:09,679
-Okay, he is. -Lift it up.
-Who's got the machete?

556
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,307
-Here.
-Are you ready?

557
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,226
Don't both of you
hit each other.

558
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,477
-Wow!
-I got him.

559
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,187
-Oh, yay!
-Put him in the fire.

560
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,355
All right.

561
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,439
Whoo, Ja-ru!

562
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:19,940
All right.

563
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,651
(excited chatter)

564
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,570
CHRISTY:<i> We were sleeping</i>
<i>on that ground.</i>

565
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,030
Wow.

566
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,490
(laughs)

567
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,492
Makes you wonder
what went in your mouth.

568
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,368
We don't even have to make
our own

569
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,661
stinking fishing line.
Look at that.

570
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,665
DEENA:<i> I think all of us</i>
<i>realized that it was cold, wet,</i>

571
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,709
<i>miserable and uncomfortable,</i>
<i>and there's bugs, so first and</i>

572
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,629
foremost,
we needed to get a shelter.

573
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,631
We could do it in shifts.

574
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,424
Six and two--
like, six on the shelter

575
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,386
and two at-at food gathering
or something.

576
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,387
Everybody ready
to go check this out?

577
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,180
-Wait a minute.
No, we're missing Heidi. -Yeah.

578
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,682
-She's coming.
-Oh, we're still missing Heidi?

579
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,683
Are you good?

580
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,060
Okay. Sorry, girls.

581
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:57,894
All right.

582
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,187
So we go back
to the boat, right?

583
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,739
CHRISTY:<i> They all kind of</i>
<i>started to have this, like,</i>

584
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,535
<i>mission or whatever, and I was</i>
<i>like, man, what's going on?</i>

585
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,744
<i>I'm like, okay,</i>
<i>I'll watch the fire.</i>

586
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,414
<i>And at the same time,</i>
<i>I was like,</i>

587
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,540
"Well, doesn't anybody care

588
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,625
that I'm the only one
out here, you know?"

589
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,091
HEIDI:<i> I haven't really</i>
<i>bonded with Christy</i>

590
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,552
<i>just because of</i>
<i>the communication barrier.</i>

591
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,722
If you can't understand
all the people around you,

592
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,724
it's hard to make
that communication.

593
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:40,395
So that-that is definitely
more of a liability right now.

594
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,733
CHRISTY:<i> It's not like</i>
<i>this is new to me.</i>

595
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,818
<i>This is what a deaf person</i>
<i>has to go through.</i>

596
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,405
<i>It's an everyday struggle.</i>

597
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,824
<i>But I don't want it to be</i>
<i>an issue every day.</i>

598
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,576
'Cause if it becomes
an issue every day,

599
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,786
then they're going to be like,

600
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,079
"Well, why do we need
this person," you know?

601
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,751
<i>So I'm still, like,</i>
<i>trying to figure out how to</i>

602
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,544
work with these women.

603
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:04,794
(laughs)

604
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,766
These two, maybe,
as the front of our shelter

605
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,601
and built back that way.

606
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,603
Yeah, this is the back
and that is the front.

607
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,104
-Put two posts here.
-Yeah.

608
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,189
We put in, uh,

609
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:28,610
six of those, uh, "Y,"
letter "Y" shape supports,

610
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,320
-and we just do the floors.
-We need them about

611
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,154
three feet long, the "Y's."

612
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,113
And there should be
plenty of them.

613
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,698
You just see a tree.
They're all over, like--

614
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,699
There's one with a "Y."

615
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,244
They don't have to be
real strong at the fork,

616
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,536
but we got to have those "Y's."

617
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,621
-Right.
-Okay?

618
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,747
ROB:
<i>Roger definitely is very bossy.</i>

619
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,998
<i>You know, when we were</i>
<i>building the shelter,</i>

620
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,626
<i>he's telling people,</i>
<i>and especially telling kids,</i>

621
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,794
<i>which is mostly this tribe,</i>

622
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,256
uh, you know, telling them,
"Go do this, go do that."

623
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,800
Ryan, you want to
stoke that fire out,

624
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,635
check that water,
see if it's boiling, please.

625
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,804
ROB:
<i>I know how to play this game.</i>

626
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,307
<i>I say, "Yes, Roger. Yes, Roger.</i>
<i>Sure, Roger."</i>

627
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,185
I just go and do it.

628
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,812
But, uh, it doesn't-doesn't
bother me too much.

629
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,815
Why don't we stay,
keep it tight on this end,

630
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,484
and then as we keep--
as we taper out,

631
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,486
-Yeah. -we'll just put
more on that side.

632
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,779
Yeah. We'll worry
about it later.

633
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,201
ROGER:<i> This kid Ryan</i>
<i>and the kid Daniel,</i>

634
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,829
uh, they're just
not contributing.

635
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,498
<i>You know, you ask them to do</i>
<i>stuff and they just--</i>

636
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,499
<i>they're talking to each other</i>

637
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,500
<i>and they're just</i>
<i>floating around.</i>

638
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,795
Well, y-your two boys
haven't even moved.

639
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,715
I've already made up my mind
on that score.

640
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,675
(laughter)

641
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,843
<i>And building the shelter,</i>
<i>these guys--</i>

642
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,885
we asked them to go out
and get some vines,

643
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,846
and, I mean, it's like
pulling, pulling teeth.

644
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,349
One, two, three.

645
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,518
(groaning)

646
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,477
<i>They're just useless.</i>

647
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,145
<i>They're digging</i>
<i>their own grave.</i>

648
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,938
<i>They've already dug it.</i>

649
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,694
Whew, that's, that's
looking good right there.

650
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,863
A little sun's coming down.

651
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,905
It's gonna be
a lot better than that.

652
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,700
We built an interesting--
we're calling it, um,

653
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,870
our postmodern survivor
for survival shelter.

654
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,912
<i>It's not a perfect square.</i>

655
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,414
<i>We got a little</i>
<i>trapezoid action going</i>

656
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,874
<i>and some different planes.</i>

657
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,543
<i>It's gonna be,</i>
<i>it's gonna be very nice.</i>

658
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,794
I think I'm really
relatively sure

659
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,422
<i>Home and Garden</i> is gonna
come and shoot us later.

660
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,924
I just think about what the
girls are going through, man.

661
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,885
I find it really hard to believe
that they're doing this.

662
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,844
I mean, and they might be,
they probably are, but...

663
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,763
<i>I don't know, man.</i>

664
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,722
I-I can't imagine them actually

665
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,932
dismantling the jungle
like we have

666
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,603
and actually building shelter.

667
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,730
ROB:<i> I don't see the women</i>
<i>working well together.</i>

668
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,357
<i>I know that their shelter</i>
<i>is not going to be</i>

669
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,399
<i>as good as ours.</i>

670
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,817
<i>I see them all crying</i>
<i>and panicking,</i>

671
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,904
trying to build a,
build a cell phone so they can

672
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,531
call their boyfriends
to come over

673
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,408
and help them build,
build the shelter.

674
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,201
<i>Outside of that,</i>
<i>I'm sure they've got</i>

675
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,244
<i>maybe three sticks together.</i>

676
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,412
ALL:
Tambaqui!

677
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,955
(cheering)

678
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,375
Like the eight musketeers.

679
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,507
(indistinct voices)

680
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,886
Right there.

681
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,349
-(groans)
-Push it down.

682
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,600
-We're gonna try to...
-Okay.

683
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:06,267
Put another one under it?

684
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,811
Oh, like, under which part?

685
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,271
Oh, she's trying
to fill that in.

686
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,606
We need big holes for those.

687
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,482
Oh, okay,
I see what you're saying.

688
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,983
JEANNE:
<i>I thought we'd be more focused.</i>

689
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,778
<i>I thought someone would</i>
<i>take the leadership role.</i>

690
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,780
But, you know,
this is in here pretty sturdy.

691
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,447
We may have to adjust
that middle one

692
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,198
'cause it's in here pretty good.

693
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:20,949
<i>But we look disorganized,</i>

694
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,284
<i>and we're not functioning well.</i>

695
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,828
<i>And considering</i>
<i>the group we have,</i>

696
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,622
it's embarrassing, I think.

697
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,748
Downright embarrassing.

698
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,502
We might be able to do
something like that, you know?

699
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,965
Is the water done?

700
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,966
No.

701
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,968
<i>Everyone's dehydrated.</i>

702
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,970
No one went
to the bathroom yesterday.

703
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,929
<i>People are going to start</i>
<i>getting down.</i>

704
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,936
JENNA:<i> The flies are swarming us</i>
<i>because we stink.</i>

705
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,813
<i>So we boiled our buffs,</i>

706
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,983
<i>we boiled underwear</i>
<i>that wasn't clean.</i>

707
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,610
Underwear needs to be clean.

708
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,488
I figure-- I think
it's a priority because of...

709
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,032
it's, you know, it's--
things can live on you,

710
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,993
especially in that area
'cause it's dark.

711
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,998
They should be cooled down a
little bit more than these ones

712
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,333
'cause I took them out
a little while ago.

713
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,002
DEENA:
<i>We're having a difficult time</i>

714
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,295
<i>getting our tasks in order,</i>

715
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,964
<i>completing them and moving on</i>
<i>to the next project.</i>

716
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,717
<i>It's a "I'm kind of</i>
<i>feeling like</i>

717
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,052
<i>I need to wash my buff now,"</i>
<i>so we wash the buffs.</i>

718
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,724
I'm thinking shelter.

719
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,684
CHRISTY:
Somebody boiled water.

720
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,811
I don't know
what it was boiled for.

721
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,897
I think they boiled it
to wash their clothes in.

722
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,608
I think it was for clothes.

723
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,693
'Cause you know
it's a priority here.

724
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:41,112
Got to have fresh, fresh buffs.

725
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,489
And panties.

726
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:42,864
CHRISTY:
Whatever.

727
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,908
Buffs.

728
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,956
(sighs):
Hoy.

729
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,012
(thunder rumbling softly)

730
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,724
Man, this thing is just heavy.

731
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,352
-I know.
-Wow.

732
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,353
Okay...

733
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,606
There's a breeze here.

734
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,108
JENNA:<i> Me and Heidi and Janet</i>
<i>went fishing, using the net.</i>

735
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,109
<i>And Janet--</i>

736
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,529
she's very sick.

737
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,905
She's not doing well at all.

738
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,281
I'm about ready to pass out.

739
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,157
(Jenna murmurs)

740
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,618
I'm not going to make it
to a challenge

741
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,411
or anything else if I don't...

742
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,412
This is too hard.

743
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,121
We can't live on that stuff.

744
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,291
That's just not going to work.

745
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,090
JENNA:
<i>She just kind of did nothing.</i>

746
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,718
<i>She just kind of sat there</i>
<i>on the boat and just said</i>

747
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,011
<i>she didn't want</i>
<i>to paddle out far because</i>

748
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,764
she didn't want
to have to paddle far back.

749
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,140
It's just...
it's-it's, like, up and down.

750
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,768
I mean, she's mostly down.

751
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,603
<i>And that's probably</i>
<i>really going to hurt her.</i>

752
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,272
<i>If we lose the challenge,</i>
<i>she might go.</i>

753
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,940
I've had it. I can't...

754
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,482
You get a nice vacation.

755
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,526
I can't do this anymore.

756
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,944
JANET:
<i>I hit rock bottom today.</i>

757
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,112
You know, we were going out

758
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,573
to fish or whatever,
which is silly.

759
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,408
It's not-- you know,
we're not successful at it.

760
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,494
Oh, look, we caught a leaf.

761
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,954
Oh, great.

762
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,832
Man, the toughest part
about this whole experience,

763
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,083
I didn't realize how tough
it was physically.

764
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,752
<i>I think that it's brutal.</i>

765
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,421
<i>Downright brutal.</i>

766
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,797
<i>And I didn't plan on that.</i>

767
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,425
<i>I mean, I planned it on being</i>
<i>difficult, but not brutal.</i>

768
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,092
This is incredible.

769
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,636
You okay?

770
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,304
No.

771
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,138
What's hurting you the most,

772
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,432
the hunger
or the-the feeling sick?

773
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,808
Or both?

774
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,977
I think she's just sick.

775
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,812
-You know what?
-(sniffles)

776
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,315
When you're-- I mean,
imagine how you and I feel,

777
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,774
and we're not sick.

778
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,651
-I know.
-I'm about ready to

779
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,821
(chuckles):
just keel over any second.

780
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:49,657
And you're also
20 years younger.

781
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,410
JANET:<i> Right now, I feel like</i>
<i>I could throw up at any moment.</i>

782
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,369
<i>I-I'm just spent.</i>

783
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,996
<i>I'm physically--</i>

784
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,957
I don't think I've ever been
this physically exhausted.

785
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,959
I don't know if I can
do a challenge.

786
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,169
I'm having trouble walking.

787
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,338
(sniffles)

788
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,064
For all those
who have some questions

789
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,066
-in this lifetime...
-Mm-hmm.

790
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,402
...I'm donating
the Magic 8 Ball.

791
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,528
-To Tambaqui!
-Butch...

792
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,865
ROB:<i> My luxury item</i>
<i>was the Magic 8 Ball.</i>

793
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:33,034
<i>The Magic 8 Ball is a really</i>
<i>good thing to have out here.</i>

794
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:37,455
Well, one thing
that you may or may not know

795
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,707
is that it really works.

796
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,375
Are we going to win immunity?

797
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,877
-Do not ask...
-(clamoring)

798
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,837
-No!
-Time-out. -Go ahead!

799
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:49,050
We do not ask the Magic 8 Ball
questions like that.

800
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,428
<i>I told the tribe there was only</i>
<i>one rule with the Magic 8 Ball,</i>

801
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,806
and that was that
they cannot ask it

802
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,724
whether we will
win or lose challenges.

803
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,894
If it says that we're
going to lose and we win,

804
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:02,397
then we'll know
the Magic 8 Ball is a sham.

805
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,774
And if it says that we're going
to lose and we do lose,

806
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,026
then it will freak us out.

807
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,404
So there's no point
in asking questions like that.

808
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,780
We asked it
a bunch of different things.

809
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,573
A lot of the talk
around the tribe

810
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,783
is centered around
the girls' tribe.

811
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:18,246
<i>Basically, uh, three girls</i>
<i>in the girls' tribe:</i>

812
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,749
<i>Shawna, Jenna and Heidi.</i>

813
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,251
Dude, is our boy Ryan
gonna get with...

814
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,754
gonna get a little something
from young Jenna?

815
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,505
-Yeah, ask that.
-Nope.

816
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,297
-"Most likely!"
-"Most likely!"

817
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,759
Nice, yo!

818
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,721
I said, Magic 8 Ball,
will I hook up with Shawna?

819
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,514
-I'm...
-No, no, look what it says.

820
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,015
-"Yes, definitely."
-"Definitely."

821
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,100
ROGER:
<i>This whole macho thing,</i>

822
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,184
<i>you know, to listen to</i>
<i>these young guys,</i>

823
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,562
<i>I mean, all they talk about</i>
<i>is women</i>

824
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,813
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>how good they're looking.</i>

825
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,982
<i>And they're talking,</i>
<i>these young guys especially.</i>

826
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,443
The juices flow and y-you--

827
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,569
That's the way it is. That's...

828
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,113
You know, boys from 15 on,
that's all we think about.

829
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:57,326
Magic 8 Ball,
will I get together with Heidi?

830
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,620
ROB:
<i>That girl Heidi--</i>

831
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,788
she is so hot.

832
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,957
She could put Viagra
out of business.

833
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,126
"Signs point to yes."

834
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:05,460
-Woo-hoo.
-Hook it up, hook it up.

835
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,461
Good job.

836
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,630
<i>There are spirits</i>
<i>in this jungle,</i>

837
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,215
and through the magic
of the Magic 8 Ball,

838
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,969
I can channel and harness
those spirits.

839
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:17,180
All right.

840
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,317
JEANNE:
<i>Joanna and I went on</i>

841
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,318
<i>a little fishing expedition</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

842
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,988
<i>We have a net.</i>

843
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,825
We placed it, um, in the little
stream that we have here,

844
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,827
with intentions of
catching some big fish.

845
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,536
JOANNA:
He just stuck.

846
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,705
I mean, he is stuck good, too.

847
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,706
Ow.

848
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,999
See, and then this net is

849
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,751
sticking onto their fin, so...

850
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,919
You know what?
I got a knife.

851
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,797
JEANNE:<i> The only thing we found</i>
<i>was some bait.</i>

852
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,132
It was, like,
really hard shell horn pout.

853
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,550
Ow.

854
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,719
-He's real...
-He's wicked pointy.

855
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,014
It had sharpy... spines
all over it.

856
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,474
-No, you're going to
have to smash him. -Oh!

857
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,642
You can't just hit him
like that.

858
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,977
Well, here, smash him.

859
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,187
One knock and he out.

860
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,188
Look at there.
See his tail.

861
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,148
I don't even think
a fish would eat this fish.

862
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,900
-(chuckles)
-We got bait.

863
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,235
We got bait.

865
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,782
♪ O, glory! ♪

866
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:21,369
We caught some bait in the net
and then we chopped it up.

867
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,370
We put it on

868
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,997
<i>our fishing poles.</i>

869
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:30,211
Please tell me we didn't
leave the paddles over there.

870
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,214
JOANNA:<i> We got over here</i>
<i>and got excited</i>

871
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,842
about getting fish
and left the oars.

872
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,679
I got it in my hand.

873
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,264
-Thank you, Father.
-Okay.

874
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,683
-All right.
-Okay.

875
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:44,684

<i>a little motivated for today</i>

883
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,915
<i>with a little gospel music.</i>

884
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,125
<i>She's just got this</i>

885
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,252
spirit about her that's--

886
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,129
I think it's great,
and I think everyone feels it.

887
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:13,588
(gasps)
Here's one.

888
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,590
A little one?

889
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,924
-Yeah.
-Grab his butt.

890
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,801
JOANNA:
<i>We did catch a little fish,</i>

891
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,762
and he was about this big.

892
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,805
And...

893
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,806
<i>-we were proud.</i>
-Want to see

894
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,933
how much protein
we're going to get out of this?

895
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,935
You know what?
Something's better than nothing.

896
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,145
You know what I'm saying?

897
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,939
No one's going to gross out
that we're eating this, right?

898
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:32,982
-No.
-No, it's food.

899
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,651
I-- See, I can handle the bait
way over the mush.

900
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,611
Let's make a little pancake.

901
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,403
HEIDI:
<i>Jeanne and Joanna brought back</i>

902
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,906
the miniature-sized fish.

903
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,489
Do you want to help
with the fire?

904
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,616
<i>I was pretty sure</i>

905
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,119
that after you gutted the thing,
there would have been--

906
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,287
there's just nothing even left.

907
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,289
But we said,
"Hey, let's go for it.

908
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,416
<i>We'll still try</i>
<i>to cook it somehow."</i>

909
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,170
Well, what would we cook it in,
that little tiny bit of fish?

910
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,838
Did somebody find the oil?
I think it's in that.

911
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,797
Yeah.

912
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,924
What kind of oil is this?

913
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,424
-Do we know?
-Baby oil, I think.

914
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,300
Just a little bit.

915
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,053
HEIDI:
<i>Jeanne had brought, uh--</i>

916
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,639
<i>it's actually a massage oil,</i>

917
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,933
but it's, like, an edible oil,
which is even funnier.

918
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,186
<i>We sliced up</i>
<i>this pint-size fish,</i>

919
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,814
and I seriously think
I had about that much of it.

920
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,151
Father, we thank you for this
opportunity to come together

921
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:19,320
like civilized women
and eat like barbarian women.

922
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,115
We thank you. We ask you to let
this be nourishing to our bodies

923
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,201
and help us to be successful
in every attempt that we have

924
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,079
and every goal that we have.

925
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,289
(chuckles)

926
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,291
I feel like
I'm eating vomit right now,

927
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,668
when it comes down to it.

928
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,878
Pretty good consistency
going on.

929
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,965
That or some snot,
one of the two.

930
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,007
(laughs)

931
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,175
Real good, though.

932
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:41,509
Thumbs up both ways.

933
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,970
(laughs)

934
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,862
First mail bomb.

935
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,405
You've got mail.

936
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,032
Thank God for mail.

937
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,534
Checking the mail, kids.

938
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,286
Here we go, first shot.

939
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,080
-Hey, we got mail.
-Oh, yeah.

940
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,165
ROGER:
<i>We are the most macho guys</i>

941
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,417
that have ever been
at<i> Survivor,</i> you know.

942
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,669
Good-looking, macho.

943
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,670
<i>We're confident we're going to</i>

944
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,421
<i>get through</i>
<i>the first challenge.</i>

945
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,214
<i>There's no doubt about that.</i>

946
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,550
If we lose to these women, man,

947
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,552
we are going to get
ragged on big-time.

948
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,429
All right, let's go.

949
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,514
"Working together
from the start,

950
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,058
"As time goes by,
you'll surely part,

951
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,185
"Use balance, agility
and a bit of wit,

952
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,188
Be the one to fall short,
and tonight could be it."

953
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,273
Oh.

954
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:37,857
Oh, it's going to be
some sort of...

955
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,442
Oh, balance and agility.

956
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,235
Standing on...
on a foot or...

957
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,617
...two, three.

958
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,954
WOMEN:
Jaburu, Jaburu, Jaburu rocks!

959
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,956
Rules, rocks, rules,
rules, rocks, rules.

960
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,125
Everybody, get your shoes,
water and...

961
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,209
DEENA:
<i>In my heart of hearts,</i>

962
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,211
<i>I think that the women</i>
<i>are going to win</i>

963
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,504
a couple of immunity challenges,
but overall,

964
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,423
I think that the men
will probably dominate,

965
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,593
<i>just based on sheer strength</i>
<i>over the women.</i>

966
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,637
The agility and wit thing
I... I can handle.

967
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,098
The balance thing,
I'm, like, okay.

968
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,392
Who's very good
at balancing, you know?

969
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,435
JENNA:<i> I told Heidi</i>
<i>if it's a physical challenge</i>

970
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,063
and we can actually
push them off things,

971
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,522
that she needs
to show them her boobs.

972
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,692
<i>And then we can</i>
<i>distract them all and go.</i>

973
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,076
Head on in, guys.

974
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,623
Welcome, guys, to your first
immunity challenge.

975
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,501
Before we get to that,
I just want to check in.

976
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,294
Been out here, uh,
two nights now.

977
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:41,587
What's going on with you guys?

978
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,130
-Doing fantastic.
-Yeah?

979
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,423
It's all-- it's good.

980
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,508
-Yeah? -It's all good
in the neighborhood.

981
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,343
-Yeah, we're having fun.
-We're all full.

982
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,636
Been out trying to fish yet?

983
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,595
-Oh, yeah. -Plenty of fish.
We don't have to try.

984
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,513
Really?

985
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,640
-Yes.
-Plenty of fish.

986
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,641
Catching a lot of fish?

987
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,642
Absolutely.

988
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,310
You buying that?

989
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:56,811
-(chuckling)
-No. -No.

990
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,520
Are you kidding me?

991
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,480
It's terrible.

992
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,440
What's going on with you guys?

993
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,442
-We got fish, and we ate them
this morning. -Yeah.

994
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,527
-(chuckling)
-We did. -Yeah.

995
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,694
For real.

996
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,154
Guys, you buying that?

997
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,072
-No. -No way.
-Not at all, no way.

998
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,366
I tasted that grain;
it's not that good.

999
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,159
-No. -Just look at them.
Look how skinny they are.

1000
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,495
All right,
let's get to today's challenge.

1001
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,663
It is for immunity.

1002
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,124
More than anything else,

1003
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:22,336
you will covet immunity.

1004
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,504
This is what you're playing for.

1005
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,797
This is the immunity idol.

1006
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,506
(cheering)

1007
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,633
Everybody get a feel of that.

1008
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:33,722
-Joanna, did you get that?
-Mm-hmm.

1009
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,723
All right.

1010
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,725
Guys.

1011
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,686
The head, dude.

1012
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,770
Do it.

1013
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,522
All right, more than
anything else in the jungle,

1014
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,731
this is what you want.

1015
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:47,361
Long as you have immunity,
you're safe, can't be voted out.

1016
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:50,489
You don't have immunity, you're
vulnerable, somebody going home.

1017
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,198
Tonight, we'll vote out
the first person,

1018
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:51,782
so let's get to the challenge.

1019
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,535
It's a doozy.

1020
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,287
It's going to require
a lot of elements.

1021
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,373
You start as a group of eight,
chained together.

1022
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,083
Your goal is to make your way
along the course,

1023
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,544
gathering keys that will
unlock you along the way.

1024
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,715
So you'll start with eight,
you'll work to four,

1025
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,591
down to two and finally one.

1026
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,427
First leg is the tough nut.

1027
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,762
<i>Make it through the tough nut</i>
<i>and retrieve your first key.</i>

1028
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,431
<i>Use this key</i>
<i>to unlock yourselves</i>

1029
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,223
into two groups of four.

1030
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,016
<i>Those groups make their way</i>

1031
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,184
<i>over a cargo net to a puzzle,</i>

1032
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,562
<i>where one group of four</i>
<i>from each tribe must</i>

1033
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:25,357
<i>decode a message using a dial</i>
<i>with letters and numbers.</i>

1034
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,734
<i>Once you decode the message,</i>

1035
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,278
<i>use the answer</i>
<i>to find the next key.</i>

1036
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:29,778
<i>This will break you into pairs.</i>

1037
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,654
<i>You now have</i>

1038
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,739
four groups of two.

1039
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,741
<i>Make your way</i>
<i>along the balance beam.</i>

1040
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,827
<i>If you fall off,</i>
<i>you got to start again.</i>

1041
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,912
<i>When everybody's</i>
<i>made their way across,</i>

1042
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,747
<i>another set of keys</i>
<i>will separate you</i>

1043
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,165
into eight individuals.

1044
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,418
<i>Then you'll come to a puzzle,</i>
<i>which two of you must complete</i>

1045
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,754
<i>to get one more key.</i>

1046
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,756
One person takes this key,

1047
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,884
<i>races up the ladder,</i>
<i>unlocks the flying fox,</i>

1048
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:55,596
<i>zips down the line</i>
<i>and grabs the last key.</i>

1049
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,431
You'll then race back
and release the rest of

1050
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:59,516
your tribe members,
who are waiting behind a gate.

1051
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,143
First tribe with
all eight tribe members

1052
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,144
past that finish line

1053
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,729
wins immunity,
three more days in the Amazon.

1054
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:09,151
For the losers, Tribal Council;
somebody's going home.

1055
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,402
Here are your belts.

1056
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,862
Belt up and I'll come check you.

1057
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:16,617
<i>Here we go, guys, for immunity.</i>

1058
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,620
Survivors ready?

1059
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,205
Go!

1060
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,668
(indistinct chatter)

1061
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,587
Let's go, let's go.

1062
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,922
PROBST: You're dead even
through the tough nut.

1063
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,301
Grab your stick
and retrieve the key.

1064
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,517
Go, go, go, go!

1065
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,101
Pick it up!

1066
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,852
Right here, right here.

1067
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,771
Go!

1068
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,773
Go, go, go, go, go!

1069
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,567
-Break it up! Let's go!
-Men are out first.

1070
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,821
Women right behind.

1071
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,241
Let's go, guys. Let's go.

1072
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,702

1073
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,711
Hold up. Hold up!

1074
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,421
-Come on, go, go!
-No, no, go!

1075
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,926
(indistinct chatter)

1076
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:16,885
Ten, ten, ten, ten.

1077
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,804
-I'm sorry.
-Ten.

1078
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,514
Okay, what's "E?"

1079
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:22,349
-Fourteen...
-"H." -"H."

1080
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,517
That's right, that's right.

1081
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,018
Got "H."
We don't have to do this.

1082
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:24,852
-Okay.
-Six.

1083
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,854
Then one would be an "E."

1084
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:27,855
Yeah.

1085
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,691
Okay, and nine... nine is a "T."

1086
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,818
Five. Five is "N."

Seven is "P."

1088
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,655
One is "L."

(indistinct voices)

1091
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,410
How about "V?"

1092
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,202
13 minus 11.

1093
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,871
-That's two.
-Plus four is six.

1094

Come on, guys.

1096
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,001
The men have
decoded the message.

1097
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,502
They're getting unlocked.

1098
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,670
-Is that it?
-Three.

1099
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,129
Wait a minute.

00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,437
and they're on the balance beam.

1110
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,272
Remember, if you fall off,

1111
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,732
you got to start again.

1112
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,734
Yeah, I'm there.

It's all right, ladies.

00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,635
Everybody here?

1197
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,719
Go, go, go!

1198
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,554
Put the locks up here
and everybody take turns.

1199
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,056
PROBST:
We are dead even.

1200
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,892
-Come on, guys.
-Let's go.

1201
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,102
Once you're free, go.

1202
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,938
Go, start your puzzle.
Two people.

1203
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,066
No, wait till they cross.
Let's go.

1204
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,734
Yeah, that's it.

1205
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,654
Keep 'em moving.

1206
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,535
PROBST: About as even
as it could be at this point.

1207
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,082
Don't let it stress you out.
Come on.

1208
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,918
You guys, the rest of it
looks like a campground.

1209
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,587
You guys are doing great.

1210
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,881
If that don't remind you,
just do what you can do.

1211
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:23,590
Do your thing, guys.
You're doing great.

1212
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,718
PROBST:
Jaburu very close.

1213
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,013
-Yeah, baby!
-Come on, come on, come on!

1214
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,100
-(women cheering)
-Oh, yeah!

1215
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,603
PROBST: Jaburu has completed
their puzzle.

1216
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,604
-Go, go!
-Go, go, go!

1217
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,564
Oh, yeah!

1218
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,942
PROBST: Heidi heading
for the flying fox.

1219
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:42,943
Go! Go! Go!

1220
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,612
(women cheering)

1221
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,116
PROBST: Come on, guys.
We got a rocket scientist

1222
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,784
and a computer guy
stuck on a puzzle.

1223
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:51,952
Go, go, go!

1224
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,122
Get up here to the gate!

1225
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,791
Up to the gate!

1226
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,169
Go! Go!

1227
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,212
Key in front of you.

1228
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,673
Key at the feather!

1229
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,177
(women cheering)

1230
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,055
Take your time.
Take your time.

1231
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:18,979
JANET:
We got this.

1232
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,189
Yeah.

1233
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,823
(cheering)

1234
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:30,824
Jaburu wins immunity!

1235
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,829
Guys, it's over.

1236
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,204
Come on in.

1237
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,583
(cheering)

1238
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,007
Jaburu, well earned.

1239
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,133
(cheering)

1240
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:51,887
Ladies, you're safe
for three more days.

1241
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,013
Nobody going home yet.

1242
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,014
Congratulations.

1243
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,849
(cheering)

1244
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,059
Tambaqui, you had a big lead.

1245
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,226
You just blew it.

1246
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,187
Despite your predictions,
you guys are

1247
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,063
going to Tribal Council tonight.

1248
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,149
Somebody will have
the distinction of

1249
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,317
being the first person
voted out.

1250
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,110
You guys can head back to camp.

1251
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,793
♪ Hallelujah! ♪

1252
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,685
DEENA:
They sure got a shock.

1253
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,852
JOANNA:
They did get a shock.

1254
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,187
They've been talking smack on us
since we separated teams.

1255
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:48,026
HEIDI:<i> We were definitely</i>
<i>behind in the challenge, and</i>

1256
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,070
we came back with flying colors
pretty much.

1257
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,073
We just really, really
kicked some butt today.

1258
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,867
-And she's twisting... -And they
were absolutely loving it.

1259
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,245
<i>And Janet has started</i>
<i>to feel a lot better now.</i>

1260
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,246
DEENA: Shawna, man,
set the pace, though,

1261
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,205
in the beginning
of that commando fall thing.

1262
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,290
She whipped us through that.
It was great.

1263
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,668
I said, I said,
"They're listening

1264
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,044
to everything
you guys are saying."

1265
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,713
They were just like parrots.

1266
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,089
We're like,
"Put the trees up."

1267
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,215
They're like,
"Put the trees up."

1268
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,050
(laughter)

1269
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,760
"Do the letters first."

1270
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,469
I'm like, "Wait a second.

1271
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,389
Is there an echo in the jungle?"

1272
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,683
HEIDI:<i> I mean, it just mentally</i>
<i>gives you more energy.</i>

1273
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,268
<i>Like, hey,</i>
<i>we really can do this.</i>

1274
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,271
We can pull this off
just as well as they can.

1275
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,397
Actually better.

1276
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,741
BUTCH:<i> We just returned</i>
<i>from our first challenge.</i>

1277
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,159
I think we went into it
maybe a little cocky.

1278
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,201
In other words,

1279
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,621
<i>there's no way that eight girls</i>

1280
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,623
<i>are going to beat</i>
<i>eight macho guys.</i>

1281
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,626
You think those chicks
really caught fish?

1282
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,044
Today, I think
you had eight guys

1283
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,588
believing in themselves
a little too much.

1284
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,010
ROB:<i> I give the girls</i>
<i>a ton of credit.</i>

1285
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,262
This is Billie Jean King
versus Bobby Riggs

1286
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,598
for a new millennium.

1287
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,183
<i>I know what's riding on this.</i>

1288
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,311
All right, fellas, I want 30
seconds of your silence, please.

1289
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:08,648
I want to say this one because
it's been pissing me off.

1290
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,485
We performed
like a bunch of cocky ass ...

1291
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,527
I think we were baited

1292
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:16,615
with the question
of how many fish have you caught

1293
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,409
after the chicks were already
asked that question.

1294
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:25,040
And I think we answered
with a cocky, arrogant answer.

1295
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,959
Don't bring me down
with your bull ...

1296
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,004
I got character,
and I got integrity.

1297
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,006
And I don't care
if they're-they're girls,

1298
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,175
if they're guys,
but don't lie to them

1299
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,135
about how good we're doing,

1300
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,303
'cause we're doing,
we're doing great.

1301
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:41,056
But don't lie to 'em.

1302
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,808
DANIEL:<i> Dave, he was</i>
<i>upset about, you know,</i>

1303
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,351
us joking around,
saying that we caught fish.

1304
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,520
It's not a big deal.

1305
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,813
He needs to lighten up.

1306
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:48,522
I mean, he's way too serious
about this.

1307
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,149
<i>I mean, who does he think he is</i>

1308
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,985
<i>to stand up on a soapbox</i>
<i>and lecture us about that?</i>

1309
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,695
If they ask,
"Have you caught any fish?"

1310
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,490
we don't say,
"Many, many, many fish."

1311
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,867
We say, "No,
we haven't found anything."

1312
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,828
ROB:
<i>Dave is a stand-up guy.</i>

1313
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:07,707
<i>He has a lot of integrity and,</i>
<i>uh, is a really honest guy,</i>

1314
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,835
which is really great for me,

1315
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,878
because I'm going
to lie and cheat

1316
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,046
and do whatever it takes to win.

1317
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,339
And if he's only going to
tell the truth all the time,

1318
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,675
that's going to hurt him
in this game.

1319
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:20,220
I just want to, uh, say,
absolutely, Dave.

1320
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,264
Dude, I-I...
I'm in total agreement.

1321
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,266
It's...
It doesn't make any sense.

1322
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,601
Just doesn't make any sense.

1323
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,103
-10-4.
-Yeah. -Yep.

1324
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,564
I just want to say one thing.
Just, the balance beam--

1325
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,648
we just had to keep going
over and over again,

1326
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,025
over and over again.
I mean, people kept falling

1327
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,194
and falling and falling,
and we got too behind.

1328
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,237
But if I, if I made the mistake,

1329
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,614
guys, I'm sorry.
You know what I mean?

1330
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,241
RYAN:<i> I saw the course,</i>
<i>and I was like,</i>

1331
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,077
"We got this in the bag."

1332
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,122
And the most athletic,
biggest guy would turn out to be

1333
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,623
just a meathead, you know?

1334
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:49,749
<i>It was Dan's fault.</i>

1335
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,002
<i>He fell off the log</i>
<i>four times, and...</i>

1336
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,336
now I'm the one
with my ass on the stove.

1337
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,048
I'm thinking, by the way...

1338
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,258
What way?

1339
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,344
Our boy, uh... our boy Ryan
is the first one out of here.

1340
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,264
That's fine by me. Um...

1341
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,933
All right. All right.

1342
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,602
We don't need to talk about it.

1343
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,936
-Fine.
-All right?

1344
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:10,937
Done.

1345
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,272
I will not vote Ryan off.

1346
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,650
Um, we're from
the same hometown.

1347
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,068
I feel we have some connection.

1348
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,528
<i>But somebody, uh, like Daniel,</i>

1349
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,240
<i>who's not really</i>
<i>volunteering to help out,</i>

1350
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,408
<i>not volunteering</i>
<i>to get involved...</i>

1351
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,954
He's not really
doing it for me right now.

1352
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,665
Yo, I'm just scared
because, uh, Dave seems like

1353
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,791
he's getting
really close to Roger.

1354
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,627
Doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

1355
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,128
I mean,
I-I really like our tribe.

1356
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,087
I think everybody's
pretty cool, man,

1357
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,673
but I don't feel like
kissing Roger's ass.

1358
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,300
I mean, I've been doing it.
I mean, seriously, I mean...

1359
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,135
-Yeah, me, too.
-"Go cut wood.

1360
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,678
Cut this. Do that."
And that's fine. I mean, cool.

1361
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,804
I don't mind.
I'm not complaining.

1362
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:45,764
I'm just saying, but...

1363
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:46,932
MATTHEW:
<i>There's a lot of tension now.</i>

1364
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,934
<i>Everyone seems to be</i>
<i>jockeying for position.</i>

1365
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:52,812
There's a lot of friction
between Ryan and Roger.

1366
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,941
<i>I think that the friction</i>
<i>has built up over the last</i>

1367
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,817
<i>couple of days, and</i>

1368
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,861
it's culminated
in kind of a face-off.

1369
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,988
We have to go
for the big time now.

1370
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,156
We go for Roger tonight.

1371
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,866
-That's three votes.
-Uh-huh.

1372
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,785
We don't talk anymore tonight.
We don't look at

1373
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,328
each other tonight. Stay the ...
away from each other.

1374
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,454
We do this, and we go down.

1375
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,331
-Hands in, we all made a pact.
-Okay, that's cool.

1376
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,875
-I'm with you, man.
-So what's the name?

1377
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,168
-Say it one more time.
-Roger.

1378
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,628
Done.

1379
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,339
RYAN:<i> Right now, what I got to</i>
<i>do is I got to go after Roger</i>

1380
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,049
<i>and break</i>
<i>that whole coalition up.</i>

1381
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,009
I just feel that they're
going to try to go for me,

1382
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,803
so I got to go for him;
I have no choice.

1383
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,515
They're gonna pick us off one
by one, I'm letting you know.

1384
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,892
So I'm saying right now,
I guarantee you

1385
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,018
we can have four votes now.

1386
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,853
They might go for Daniel,
or they might go for me,

1387
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,689
-and we can still win.
-ROB:<i> Ryan is</i>

1388
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,525
fun, but he's also loud, uh,

1389
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,361
abrasive at times
and extremely self-centered.

1390
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,905
If you say you don't want
to know, it's fine,

1391
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,740
but just I'm asking you--
if we're good, we're good.

1392
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:46,741
I'm not gonna...

1393
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,994
'Kay, we're good.

1394
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,704
No more talking, to anybody.

1395
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,206
Don't look at anybody else,
just say tonight: "Roger."

1396
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,666
-Yeah. Game, set, match.
-All right, man.

1397
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,668
Done.

1398
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,586
ROB:<i> You really have to</i>
<i>operate as a team</i>

1399
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,880
<i>and look out for other people's</i>
<i>interests at times.</i>

1400
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,049
<i>The guy is focused</i>
<i>only on himself.</i>

1401
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,635
Roger, on-- for his part,
though, is extremely bossy

1402
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,930
and is telling everybody,
everybody what to do.

1403
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,390
Real quickly.

1404
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:14,811
Alex, Matthew...

1405
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,397
uh... David and myself.

1406
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,400
Clearly, uh, those two kids
are gone.

1407
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,068
As long as we're in agreement,

1408
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,069
that's what's
the important thing.

1409
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:23,987
Yeah, we are.

1410
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,239
ROB:
<i>Privately, Ryan has asked me</i>

1411
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:27,574
<i>to vote with him</i>
<i>to get rid of Roger,</i>

1412
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:33,288
and Roger has asked me to vote
with him to get rid of Ryan.

1413
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:36,207
And I've told them both
that I will do what they want.

1414
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,375
Ready to party on?

1415
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,209
-Yep.
-Ready.

1416
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,045
-Let's go, guys.
-ROB:<i> It's Roger</i>

1417
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,254
<i>versus Ryan.</i>

1418
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:43,214
<i>I'm just going to see</i>
<i>which way it clears out.</i>

1419
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,632
<i>I mean, both guys have</i>
<i>their pluses and minuses.</i>

1420
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:15,288
Behind each of you guys is
a torch in your tribe color.

1421
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,415
Grab a torch,
approach the flame,

1422
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,126
dip it and get fire.

1423
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,964
This is part of the ritual
of Tribal Council

1424
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,133
because fire
most definitely represents

1425
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,802
your life in this game.

1426
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:29,636
As long as you have fire,
you're still alive.

1427
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,807
When your fire's done,
so are you.

1428
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,350
Take a seat.

1429
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,940
Tribal Council is where you are

1430
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:42,649
held accountable
for your action.

1431
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,443
Tonight, somebody will be

1432
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,195
the first person
voted out of the Amazon.

1433
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,323
But before we get to that,
let's have a little chat.

1434
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:52,158
I'm guessing this has to be

1435
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,869
really humbling
for you guys right now.

1436
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,454
-Say that again.
-Or am I wrong, Roger?

1437
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,831
Is it just one challenge,
you know,

1438
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,290
and, hey, what's the big deal?

1439
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,168
It's-It's humbling, but,
uh, you know, we did our best.

1440
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,086
And the interesting thing was

1441
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,255
we thought we were
going to get on the--

1442
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,881
get beat on the mental side,

1443
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,508
and they actually beat us
on the physical side.

1444
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,009
And that was a shock.

1445
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,344
No, they beat you
all the way around.

1446
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,513
Okay.
(chuckles)

1447
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,014
-Well?
-Well, they did. They--

1448
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,141
Hey, they won fair and square.

1449
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:19,018
And, you know, what can you say?

1450
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,687
Well, there were
a lot of comments made,

1451
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,857
specifically by you,
Daniel, on the boat--

1452
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,234
"We will not
lose one challenge."

1453
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,194
Well, you know,
that's what happens when you get

1454
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,737
a little cocky, you know,
you get humbled.

1455
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,198
Hey, it was a mistake.

1456
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,368
I think all-all of our guys,
we did really well.

1457
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:37,871
I mean, we had it,
but I blew it.

1458
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,080
I mean, it's my fault.

1459
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:39,581
I'm the reason why we're here.

1460
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,041
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1461
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,710
But you're-you're tied
next to your partner here, Ryan,

1462
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:47,005
who didn't seem to be
doing a lot better.

1463
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,381
Well, hey, you know,

1464
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:50,049
the girls--
they might have won the battle,

1465
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:50,717
but they haven't won the war.

1466
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,512
Alex, how tough is it to be

1467
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,265
so overconfident and lose?

1468
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,392
I think initially
we were pretty over--

1469
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:00,226
we were pretty confident.

1470
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,896
We were like,
yeah, gung ho guys.

1471
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:03,897
Women are not
going to just roll over.

1472
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,900
They're going to want
to compete even harder

1473
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,568
because it's women against men.

1474
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,569
And today is proof of it.

1475
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,322
We worked really hard.

1476
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,323
We got beat.

1477
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:14,574
We had a bad day.

1478
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,326
That's all it comes down to.

1479
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,577
You had a few minutes
to see the women.

1480
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,205
I know you talked about them.

1481
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,331
Anybody stand out?

1482
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:24,459
I think every one of those girls
has a unique quality...

1483
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,668
-(laughter)
-Uh...

1484
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,588
...and, uh, some have more
unique qualities than others.

1485
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,797
Some are physically unique.

1486
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:34,260
But when it's all said and done,
uh, none of those girls are

1487
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,595
worth a million dollars,
and that's where I stand.

1488
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,804
How about you, Daniel?

1489
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:40,934
I'll just go out and say I think
Shawna is pretty damn hot.

1490
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:41,601
Uh, she's very athletic.

1491
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,937
She's got a great body.

1492
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,563
But I don't know. Right now,

1493
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,232
after not showering
for three days,

1494
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,234
I don't know how attracted
I would be to her, but...

1495
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,235
(chuckles)

1496
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:50,693
But you're putting it out there.

1497
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,238
-Yeah.
-Dave.

1498
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,491
Follow suit, Shawna wore
a, uh, ski hat; that's badass.

1499
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,742
I think Ryan was-was
trying to say it.

1500
00:58:57,825 --> 00:59:01,120
Make an analogy--
the quarterback doesn't

1501
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:01,996
screw the cheerleaders
at halftime.

1502
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,748
You know, we're here
to play the game.

1503
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,125
Wow.

1504
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,585
You should be
living with these guys.

1505
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,586
(laughter)

1506
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,463
Alex.

1507
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:12,465
I'm going to be the third one
to vote for Shawna here.

1508
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:13,466
She's-She's a hottie.

1509
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:14,968
-Bangarang.
-Yeah.

1510
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,094
Yeah, absolutely.

1511
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,430
I just wanted to, uh,
add to my vote that I also think

1512
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,642
that Shawna is hot, but I think
that Heidi is the hottest.

1513
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,644
You know what's great
about th-- Oh, Ryan, yes?

1514
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:28,022
(scattered chuckles)

1515
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,649
He loves that girl.

1516
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,692
I mean, he-he really,
really likes...

1517
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,152
Now, "love" is a strong word,

1518
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,570
being that I've never
spoken to her.

1519
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,571
PROBST:
You know what's great?

1520
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,782
You came out from day one
talking more trash

1521
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,909
than I've ever heard, ever.

1522
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,786
You got your asses kicked.

1523
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,664
And yet, when we get to women,
it's like, "Ah, who cares?

1524
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,832
I want to hook up."

1525
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:50,003
That's why you guys could be
really in serious trouble.

1526
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:54,674
All right.

1527
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,467
It is time to vote.

1528
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:56,718
Roger, you're first.

1529
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,737
He gives me so much advice,
it really irritates me.

1530
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,587
My advice to you is, uh,

1531
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,047
don't hunt what you can't kill.

1532
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,440
Ryan, I think
you're a pretty good boy.

1533
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,400
The only problem is
that you're still a boy.

1534
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,111
Sometimes silence is golden.

1535
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,707
I didn't like your attitude at

1536
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,250
the immunity challenge today,

1537
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,710
and I didn't like the way

1538
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:12,960
it reflected upon the team.

1539
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,309
I'll go tally the votes.

1540
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,402
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

1541
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,445
The person voted out
will be asked to leave

1542
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,406
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

1543
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,116
I'll read the votes.

1544
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,287
First vote...

1545
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,539
Ryan.

1546
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,171
Roger.

1547
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,758
Dan.

1548
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:04,429
One vote Dan, one vote Ryan,
one vote Roger.

1549
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,686
Ryan.

1550
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,315
Roger.

1551
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:19,986
One vote Dan, two votes Ryan,
two votes Roger.

1552
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,367
Ryan.

1553
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,458
Roger.

1554
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,878
We're tied: three votes Ryan,
three votes Roger.

1555
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:43,217
First person
voted out of the tribe...

1556
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,596
Ryan.
Need to bring me your torch.

1557
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,611
Ryan, the tribe has spoken.

1558
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,324
It's time for you to go, man.

1559
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:19,795
Came into the game
a little confident,

1560
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:20,796
maybe a little arrogant.

1561
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,508
But what should be
more concerning is this is

1562
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,677
clearly a tribe divided,
based on tonight's vote.

1563
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,513
Might be something
worth looking at.

1564
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,180
36 more days.

1565
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,265
Guys can head back to camp.

1566
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,016
Good night.

1567
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,159
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

1568
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:56,207
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor...

1569
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,417
<i>An Amazon storm</i>
<i>hits both tribes,</i>

1570
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,253
<i>leaving the men dry...</i>

1571
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,003
Suck to be outside right now.

1572
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,214
<i>...and the women drenched.</i>

1573
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,215
Forgot that we're in
the middle of the Amazon

1574
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,967
and that torrential rainstorms
come by daily.

1575
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,469
<i>And a shocking discovery</i>

1576
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,595
<i>threatens to split</i>
<i>the Jaburu tribe.</i>

1577
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,264
There's something in there that
shouldn't be in there.

1578
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,682
Somebody just needs to fess up.

1579
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,105
Well, guys, here we are.

1580
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,773
I guess when I knew
I did<i> Survivor,</i>

1581
01:04:20,856 --> 01:04:22,775
I knew I was in for the biggest
challenge of my life.

1582
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:24,068
<i>And, uh, I definitely</i>
<i>got what I came in for,</i>

1583
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,445
<i>and I definitely</i>
<i>got what I expected.</i>

1584
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,738
<i>Um, I learned a lot, though.</i>

1585
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,115
<i>I learned how to make shelter,</i>
<i>and more importantly,</i>

1586
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:32,368
<i>I learned a lot about myself</i>
<i>and, uh, how I perceive others</i>

1587
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:33,619
<i>and how they perceive me.</i>

1588
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,954
<i>You know, I thought I'd be mad,</i>
<i>but for the first time,</i>

1589
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,665
<i>I just, I really put things</i>
<i>in perspective.</i>

1590
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,458
<i>And it was a great journey.</i>

1591
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,751
<i>I had a lot of fun.</i>

1592
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,295
<i>I wish you guys all the best.</i>

1593
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,629
<i>So good luck to the winner,</i>

1594
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,964
and, uh, we'll see you
around soon.

1595
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,425
And, uh, God bless.
