<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,379
Margaret felt betrayed by Judd.

4
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:05,588
>> It was me who went the

5
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,424
opposite of what my tribe went.

6
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,967
I'm feeling good about it.

7
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,592
>> Judd flipped the very first

8
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,095
day the new tribe came to be,

9
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,346
and he didn't bother to look

10
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,347
back.

11
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,349
He is a traitor.

12
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,893
>> PROBST: Survivors ready, go!

13
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:19,477
At the reward challenge, Jamie

14
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,396
was left in the dust, giving

15
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,481
Yaxha a huge win.

16
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,733
>> (whooping)

17
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,651
>> PROBST: Yaxha wins reward.

18
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,652
>> Damn it.

19
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,903
>> PROBST: Back at camp, Yaxha

20
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,697
enjoyed the spoils of victory,

21
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,865
a floating croc-proof swimming

22
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:32,490
pool.

23
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,075
>> Oh, man, look at this!

24
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,827
>> The reward was spectacular.

25
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,120
I didn't imagine it was going to

26
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,580
be that good.

27
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,957
>> Yaxha! Whoo!

28
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,167
>> PROBST: At Nakum, Stephenie

29
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,710
was frustrated.

30
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,961
>> I mean, I'm sick of losing.

31
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,546
I just feel like I'm in a really

32
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,466
bad dream and I can't get out.

33
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,634
>> PROBST: Over at Yaxha, Blake

34
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,761
was getting on everyone's

35
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,094
nerves.

36
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,262
>> My girlfriend's got big

37
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,097
boobs.

38
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,391
>> Blake is such an idiot.

39
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,476
I have a new favorite game out

40
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,226
here.

41
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,020
It's called "Bait Blake."

42
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:02,645
>> Blake, what is your absolute

43
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,522
best drunk story?

44
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,148
>> He is digging himself into a

45
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,108
hole and I'm going to do

46
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,109
everything I can to make sure

47
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,319
that he has a shovel.

48
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,320
>> PROBST: In the battle for

49
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,363
immunity, Nakum ended their

50
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,990
losing streak.

51
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:15,366
For the win, if Nakum gets it...

52
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,286
Nakum wins immunity!

53
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,539
>> Who's smiling now?

54
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,582
>> PROBST: With Tribal Council

55
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,042
looming, Gary, Brian and Amy

56
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,752
were outnumbered.

57
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,711
>> The Yaxha tribe is going

58
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,629
into the Tribal Council

59
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,171
tonight with four old Nakum

60
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,757
members and three old Yaxha

61
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,258
members, so the math is right

62
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,635
there.

63
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,677
>> PROBST: So, they approach the

64
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,970
former Nakum members to turn on

65
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:36,262
Blake.

66
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,224
>> I hate being the swing vote.

67
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,392
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

68
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,185
both Danni and Bobby Jon shook

69
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,771
things up when they turned on

70
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,439
Blake and helped vote him out.

71
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,607
>> PROBST: Blake, the tribe has

72
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,651
spoken.

73
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,276
13 are left, who will be voted

74
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,156
out tonight?

75
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,660
(theme song playing)

76
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,661
Captioning sponsored by

77

NETWORK TELEVISION

79
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,282
>> The Blake vote opened my eyes

80
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,327
quite a bit because we were four

81
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,163
strong.

82
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,498
Then Blake got voted out.

83
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,917
I'm like, how the heck did that

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,334
happen?

85
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,669
You know, people will flip

86
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,212
things around on you.

87
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,422
And you'll find yourself voted

88
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,423
off.

89
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,008
You won't even know how the heck

90
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,385
it happened.

91
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,553
>> What do you think, man?

92
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,764
Any regrets about last night?

93
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,600
>> Um, yeah, some, but that's

94
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,560
just... it was just a part...

95
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,521
a part of that... that was a

96
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,398
stage in the game where I had to

97
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:57,362
do what I had to do, you know?

98
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,363
I know I liked him.

99
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,447
I know you liked him.

100
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,492
But he was rubbing a lot of

101
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,662
other people the wrong way,

102
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:17,465
you know?

103
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,843
>> Yeah.

104
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,303
>> Voting off Blake was kind of

105
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,222
like a "get out of jail free"

106
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,723
card for me, Gary and Amy,

107
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,183
because, right now, the numbers

108
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,226
are even.

109
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,519
And so, the bottom line is that

110
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,937
we need to start knocking out

111
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,522
former Nakum members one by one.

112
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,191
It's got to happen.

113
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,513
>> What I don't see is why they

114
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,848
have to bite you through the

115
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:07,932
shirt.

116
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,020
I mean, do they just have to?

117
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,272
>> This morning is kind of like

118
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:14,605
every morning.

119
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,691
The mosquitoes are horrible.

120
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,734
Every time it rains, they just

121
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,153
get worse and worse.

122
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,864
>> Mosquitoes are thick.

123
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,282
Like a hundred times worse than

124
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:24,907
I have ever seen in Florida in

125
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,491
the mangroves in the middle of

126
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,535
the night.

127
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,704
That's how bad it is.

128
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:35,752
>> Everyone is trying to get

129
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,128
along really hard.

130
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,880
Like, you know, I keep trying to

131
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,464
be positive and it's harder to

132
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,175
do that when someone is being

133
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,760
really a negative energy around

134
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,552
camp, which is what Margaret's

135
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,680
being right now.

136
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,015
After Brooke got voted off, she

137
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,933
was just devastated, and just

138
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,560
took it to so hard.

139
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,479
The six of us get along really,

140
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,980
really well and Margaret is

141
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,233
just, like, kind of fading out.

142
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,695
>> She is miserable, probably

143
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,030
because she got stuck with me

144
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,198
instead of getting stuck with

145
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:05,448
Brandon.

146
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,325
Instead of getting stuck with

147
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,451
Blake, instead of getting stuck

148
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,870
with Danni or one of them.

149
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,538
She got me.

150
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,748
>> I used to be much higher on

151
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,584
the food chain than I am now.

152
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,419
Now I'm absolutely on the

153
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,965
opposite end after the mix-up.

154
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,925
I'm sure Judd's waiting to get

155
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,301
me off.

156
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,886
I'm not giving up.

157
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,179
But I'm not going to beat my

158
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,180
head against the wall.

159
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,515
I will wait for there to be an

160
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,558
opening.

161
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,601
>> You have somebody that has a

162
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,436
sore thumb walking around camp,

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,271
man, miserable.

164
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:37,855
That puts the team down, man.

165
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,191
We don't need that right now.

166
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,653
>> She just can't grasp the fact

167
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,612
that the old tribe ain't coming

168
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,031
back, man, and this is what

169
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,450
you're stuck with.

170
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,455
>> PROBST: Come on in, Nakum.

171
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,667
Come on in, Yaxha!

172
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,462
Nakum, getting your first look

173
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,298
at the new Yaxha.

174
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,258
Blake voted out at the last

175
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,384
Tribal Council.

176
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,430
You guys ready to get to it?

177
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,767
First things first.

178
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,477
Glad to see that you brought

179
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,854
the immunity idol with you,

180
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,855
as instructed.

181
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,981
It doesn't play a part today,

182
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,232
though.

183
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,692
I will explain that in a minute.

184
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,902
Let's get to today's challenge.

185
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,611
Each tribe will put two people

186
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,905
on opposite sides of a giant

187
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,365
ball.

188
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:29,949
On my go, both teams will push

189
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,618
the ball against each other.

190
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,911
The object is to maneuver the

191
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,372
ball over your own goal line.

192

214
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,576

Two people are going home.

00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,000
In addition to the barbecue

One tribe member will be safe at

229
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,766
That person will also sit in on

230
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,684
the other tribe's Tribal Council

231
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,102
where they will be able to

232
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:40,686
gather information.

233
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,730
And in a game where knowledge is

234
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,398
power, this is a crucial

235
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,275

383
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,043
Danni and Amy pushing Margaret

384
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,128
and Cindy back.

385
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,546
Margaret and Cindy pushing back

386
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,757
now.

387
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,844
Margaret and Cindy, now trying

388
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,137
to hold off Danni and an

389
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,556
injured Amy.

390
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,224
>> Push!

391
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:28,849
>> Get on the left!

392
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,684
>> PROBST: Cindy wedged up

393
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,727
against the tree, they lost

394
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,020
a lot of ground.

395
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,063
Amy and Danni with huge

396
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,773
momentum.

397
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,691
Yaxha scores.

398
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,526
>> Yeah!

399
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,069
>> PROBST: We are tied 2-2!

400
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,654
>> Yes!

401
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,656
Yes!

402
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,032
>> PROBST: We are tied up 2-2,

403
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,701
this point will decide it,

404
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,827
barbecue feast, shot at

405
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,912
individual immunity at stake.

406
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,748
We have a new matchup for

407
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,666
Yaxha.

408
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,793
Bobby Jon and Brian taking on

409
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,086
Judd and Jamie for Nakum.

410
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,422
Survivors, ready, go!

411
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,591
>> Go, go!

412
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,468
Yeah!

413
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,970
>> Your ball, your ball!

414
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:06,971
Yes!

415
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:07,972
>> PROBST: Brian shoved against

416
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,889
the tree.

417
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,891
He's lost a lot of leverage.

418
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,977
(shouting)

419
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,229
Judd is down!

420
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,021
Bobby Jon and Brian pushing,

421
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,982
making up ground into the

422
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:18,941
obstacle.

423
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,027
>> Go! Go! Go!

424
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:22,611
>> PROBST: Jamie and Judd get

425
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,823
some momentum going.

426
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,910
Bobby Jon and Brian trying to

427
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,495
hold them off.

428
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,830
Judd and Jamie getting closer

429
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,124
for Nakum.

430
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,417
And they have it!

431
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,836
Nakum wins a barbecue feast and

432
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,047
a shot at individual immunity.

433
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,263
>> PROBST: Yaxha, good effort.

434
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,889
Amy coming back strong,

435
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,057
not enough.

436
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,350
No reward, no shot at individual

437
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,351
immunity.

438
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,561
The only thing you have to look

439
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,562
forward to is Tribal Council

440
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,063
tonight.

441
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:58,939
I will see you there.

442
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,274
Head on back to camp.

443
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,026
Nakum, good effort.

444
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,278
Two victories in a row.

445
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,988
Barbecue feast is yours.

446
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,947
But that is later.

447
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:07,489
We're not through here yet.

448
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,949
One more challenge.

449
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:09,950
Somebody is going to get

450
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,160
individual immunity for

451
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,411
tonight's Tribal Council.

452
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,330
Follow me and I will explain.

453
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,585
All right, the barbecue feast is

454
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,586
already yours.

455
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,170
But this is what you should be

456
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,046
concentrating on now.

457
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,130
One of you gets a shot at

458
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,591
individual immunity.

459
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,884
Here's how it works:

460
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,927
On my go, all seven of you will

461
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,470
race out into the field to

462
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,971
collect three bags of letter

463
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,139
tiles.

464
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,807
Each time you untie a bag, you

465
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,808
got to bring it back to your

466
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,809
station.

467
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,894
Once you've collected all three

468
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,978
bags, untie them, empty out 11

469
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,938
letters.

470
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,315
Use those 11 letters to form a

471
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,817
two-word phrase.

472
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,818
First person to spell that

473
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,862
phrase correctly wins immunity,

474
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,822
safe tonight at Tribal Council.

475
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,948
Clear?

476
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:50,824
Take a spot.

477
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,326
We'll get started.

478
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:56,413
For immunity, Survivors ready?

479
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,499
Go!

480
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,876
Each time you untie a bag, you

481
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,460
bring it back to your station.

482
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,796
Once you have all three bags,

483
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,380
you untie the bags, empty out

484
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,131
the letters, start spelling the

485
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,591
word.

486
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,259
Steph back with her first bag,

487
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,220
Cindy back with her first bag.

488
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,638
Margaret back with her first

489
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,223

Lydia, Rafe, Jamie, back with

491
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,601
his bag.

492
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,560
Judd bringing up the rear with

493
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,728
his first bag.

494
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,646
Stephanie back with bag number

495
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,939

00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,107
Cindy back with bag number two.

497
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,860
Margaret and Rafe with their

498
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,696

500
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,243
Jamie with bag number two.

501
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,744
Stephanie has her third bag, she

502
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,663
can begin emptying the tiles.

503
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,415
Cindy back with her third bag.

504
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,833
Rafe in it now.

Margaret and Jamie in it now.

506
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,128
Judd in it now.

507
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,130
Two-word phrase-- when you think

508
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,256
you have it, yell it out.

509
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,383
Steph has all of her letter

510
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,302
tiles out.

511
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,096
Margaret has all her tiles out.

512
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,723
>> I can't get it freakin' out

513
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,724
of the bag, man.

514
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,558
>> PROBST: Judd having trouble

515
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,851
even getting his tiles out.

516
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,435
Margaret trying to figure it

517
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:04,648
out.

518
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,567
Rafe very close.

519
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,947
Ancient ruin... ancient ruin...

520
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,198
ancient ruin.

521
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,950
>> PROBST: Two word phrase, when

522
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:15,534
you think you have it, yell it

out.

524
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:17,369
>> Got it.

525
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,329
>> PROBST: Stop!

526
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,456
Rafe has it first.

527
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,832
Ancient Ruin.

528
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,125
Rafe wins immunity.

529
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:23,333
>> Rafe?

530
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,168
>> Thanks.

531
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,170
>> Thank you.

532
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,047
>> Judd had it, but he didn't

533
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,882
have the puzzle.

534
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,342
Damn! I had it!

535
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,093
Next time I got to keep my

536
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,303
mouth shut, man.

537
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,304
>> PROBST: So Judd, you weren't

538
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,307
in this challenge at all, you

539
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,099
figure out the phrase and say it

540
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,100
and Rafe gets it.

541
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,101
>> I didn't know I was that

542
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,103
smart, man.

543
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,104
>> PROBST: Rafe is wearing

544
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,105
immunity.

Rafe, come on over.

546
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,149
>> Great stuff!

547
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,985
>> PROBST: Turn around.

548
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:50,569
You are safe tonight at Tribal

549
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,112
Council.

550
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,405
So, you guys have a barbecue

551
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,198
feast.

552
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,824
Grab it and head out.

553
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,408
>> (whoops)

554
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,414
>> Oh, my God!

555
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,923
>> Way to go, Nakum!

556
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,340
>> Good job!

557
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,176
>> Whoo! We did it again, kids.

558
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,887
>> We're on a winning streak.

559
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,931
>> Today was an amazing day.

560
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,682
Today we won the barbecue and

561
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,100
then we had individual immunity

562
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,185
and I won the first individual

563
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,437
immunity, which is awesome!

564
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,814
>> Good job!

565
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,357
>> Right here, baby.

566
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,025
Whoo!

567
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,652
That was just an all-around

568
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,362
good day, man.

569
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,738
>> No kidding.

570
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,908
>> What happened to Bobby Jon,

571
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:38,909
man?

572
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,660
>> Today in that reward

573
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,828
challenge, man, Bobby Jon hit a

574
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,037
flip switch, man.

575
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,663
I was just waiting for him to

576
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,997
swing, 'cause I was just going

577
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:44,998
to block that and knock him

578
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:45,999
right there.

579
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,000
>> He always does that.

580
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,377
>> Why? I'm like why?

581
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,128
>> Is he crazy?

582
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:50,754
>> The guy got right in my face

583
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,589
and started screaming because I

584
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,423
was happy because we won.

585
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,299
So I started screaming back.

586
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,759
I thought it was about to go to

587
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,301
blows, you know.

588
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,012
Just Southern people, we're

589
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,430
crazy and we know it.

590
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,515
>> Here's to Nakum.

591
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,350
>> To Nakum.

592
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,268
>> And our families that can't

593
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,894
be with us.

594
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,354
>> Thank you, guys.

595
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,481
>> Thank you, God.

596
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,334
>> Who the hell wants to go to

597
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,919
Tribal Council?

598
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:31,837
It sucks.

599
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,838
You know?

600
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,922
Two in a row, one night after

601
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,465
the other.

602
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,384
It's horrible.

603
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,344
>> Keep going.

604
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,679
You too, Danni.

605
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,722
>> Well, we all gave everything,

606
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,890
I mean, you know.

607
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,808
That's just, they're just

608
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,728
bigger, more weight, that's all.

609
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,355
>> We just can't dwell on it.

610
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,359
>> Mm-hmm.

611
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:59,197
>> Whoa. Whoa!

612
00:19:59,281 --> 00:19:59,781
>> Jamie is kind of cocky and

613
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,491
arrogant and there is a line

614
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,576
crossed with me.

615
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,493
And he crossed it today.

616
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,953
And I just went over there and I

617
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,997
put him in his place.

618
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,421
>> You know, there's another

619
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,884
bear out in the woods, too.

620
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,719
>> I am concerned.

621
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,386
I felt I let them down when I

622
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,513
fell that second time I went out

623
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,514
there.

624
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,891
I went to go push back and my

625
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,351
same ankle goes and it snaps.

626
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,227
I wasn't sure what actually

627
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,478
happened.

628
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,437
But, you know, it's okay, 'cause

629
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,564
I went out there the next time.

630
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,899
It's swollen, but I can live

631
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,400
with it.

632
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,661
>> As a tribe, we're three

633
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,079
former Yaxha, and three former

634
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,080
Nakum, everybody is vulnerable.

635
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:48,664
You know, it might be an easy

636
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,666
vote to vote out Amy tonight,

637
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,875
but would it be our smartest

638
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,085
vote down the road because Gary

639
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:53,669
and I will be outnumbered by

640
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,463
three former Nakum.

641
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,142
>> Brian wants to rejoin Yaxha

642
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,228
to stay strong, but the weak

643
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,021
part of his plan is, why would I

644
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:13,689
get rid of Bobby Jon, one of the

645
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,775
strongest players on this team?

646
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,988
>> We will win the next one,

647
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,031
I guess.

648
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,163
>> Amy and Brian are probably in

649
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,040
the biggest threat of getting

650
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,750
voted off.

651
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,793
Because I don't know what kind

652
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,544
of alliances they have.

653
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,879
But you know, they're probably

654
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,633
the physically weaker players.

655
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,348
>> Of the six of us, any one

656
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,891
could go home tonight.

657
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,476
There's no one who is safe.

658
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,728
Nobody has immunity and we're

659
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,770
all looking to get each other

660
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,313
out of this game so we can get

661
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,356
further.

662
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,524
And I'm just hoping that Gary

663
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,525
and Amy aren't pulling the wool

664
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,027
over my eyes and everybody just

665
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,485
ends up voting for me.

666
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,487
Because honestly, anything,

667
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,282
anything can happen at Tribal

668
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,451
Council tonight.

669
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,464
>> Oh, my God!

670
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,757
>> I never had a hamburger taste

671
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,425
like this.

672
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,968
>> It doesn't get better than

673
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,970
this.

674
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:27,846
>> The only thing that sucks

675
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:28,972
about this, man, is that we've

676
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,724
got to go to freakin' Tribal

677
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,933
Council.

678
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,143
I just hate that.

679
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:33,727
>> Just gearing up for that,

680
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,562
it sucks, man.

681
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,065
>> Even though we won the

682
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,983
reward, the barbecue, and I won

683
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,401
individual immunity, both tribes

684
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,944
still have to go to Tribal

685
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,279
Council.

686
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:44,821
So it kind of takes a little

687
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,573
something out of the victory

688
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,616
because nobody ever wants to go

689
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:54,790
to Tribal Council.

690
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,957
>> So we're down to what, we

691
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,793
lose Margaret tonight,

692
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,919
then we're down to how many,

693
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,378
what, six, right?

694
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,091
>> Yeah, six.

695
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,092
>> I think Margaret knows she's

696
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,093
going.

697
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:06,718
She's not even trying to put up

698
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,345
a fight.

699
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,387
>> She's always on the

700
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,722
sidelines, man.

701
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,556
>> I go to Tribal Council

702
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,226
tonight, man, not a damn worry

703
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,227
in the world, man.

704
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,811
Hell, no, man, they need me,

705
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,436
man.

706
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,521
I'm one of the big guns here,

707
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,522
man.

708
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,648
I'm not saying I'm going

709
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,649
overboard, but I feel, you know,

710
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,609
I can do what I want around

711
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,486
these people.

712
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,695
Rafe, you sure you don't want

713
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,696
that beer?

714
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,697
>> Yeah.

715
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,074
>> Yeah, man, I got no problem

716
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,534
taking it.

717
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,036
>> Judd is the person, I think,

718
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,496
as a tribe member and

719
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,498
as a person, is the most

720
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,666
offensive to the tribe.

721
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,334
>> (belches)

722
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:39,918
>> I give you the whole beer,

723
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,545
you give me your hot dog.

724
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,380
>> You want to switch?

725
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,131
>> Absolutely.

726
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,423
So now I got two beers.

727
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,007
>> Well, no, there's only two

728
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,843
left.

729
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,344
>> Judd does what Judd wants to,

730
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,637
when he wants to and how he

731
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,596
wants to.

732
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,558
The funny part is Judd's

733
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,143
Judd's biggest enemy.

734
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,019
>> There's only two beers left.

735
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,106
>> Uh-oh.

736
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,023
>> I definitely got one coming,

737
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:02,691
without a doubt.

738
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,235
>> No, one beer's mine.

739
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,195
These are mine.

740
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,405
Each were supposed to have

741
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,990
two beers and one root beer.

742
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,199
But, somehow, it ended up that

743
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,368
what's left does not equal out

744
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,995
to what is owed.

745
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,788
So basically, we have a

746
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,207
beer-root beer conundrum.

747
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,126
>> Who's hiding the beer, man?

748
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,544
>> There's three beers left.

749
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,712
What are you talking about?

750
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,964
>> One is Cindy's half-full one.

751
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:26,631
>> Whenever Judd screws up, Judd

752
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,009
makes a big deal about it,

753
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,261
and tries to make it a whole

754
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,637
explosion so it kind of diffuses

755
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,638
the focus on him.

756
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,639
>> I don't understand this whole

757
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,557
beer thing.

758
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,558
How are we not...?

759
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,310
>> I don't either.

760
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,477
>> It doesn't make any sense.

761
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,563
>> I know.

762
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,191
>> We will never figure it out.

763
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,192
>> Yeah, but who?

764
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,026
Whoever drank the beer is

765
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,569
going home tonight.

766
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,404
>> Judd's got to watch his

767
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:49,696
mouth.

768
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,490
He gets so pumped up.

769
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,992
And his mouth works before his

770
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,493
brain does.

771
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,494
>> You had two from you.

772
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,579
And you had one of his and whose

773
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,580
else's?

774
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,664
>> How many beers do I have

775
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,624
left?

776
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,750
I had two, right?

777
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,709
>> I felt like I freaking

778
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,710
deserved it anyway, if I took an

779
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,629
extra beer, you wouldn't be

780
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,922
eating damn hot dog and this

781
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:07,964
cheeseburger if it wasn't for

782
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:08,757
me.

783
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,591
>> You know what, everybody can

784
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,676
kiss my ass.

785
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,719
And I hope you enjoyed your hot

786
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,430
dog and your hamburger today.

787
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,098
>> He's got to stop and think

788
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,017
about what he's saying before it

789
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,519
comes out of his mouth.

790
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:20,936
Because outbursts of

791
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,313
inconsideration like that is

792
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:23,939
going to be a negative mark on

793
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,399
his slate.

794
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,484
And in the end, that could come

795
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,112
back to get him.

796
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,897
>> PROBST: All right.

797
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,524
Let's start with the

798
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,233
fun stuff first.

799
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,735
Steph, tell me about the feast.

800
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,736
>> It was awesome.

801
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,737
We cooked the hamburgers up

802
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,655
right away.

803
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,698
There were a coup of trades

804
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,824
going on, beer for root beer,

805
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,367
root beer for beer.

806
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,411
I traded Judd for a hot dog.

807
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,829
He took my beer.

808
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,163
>> Judd, you gave up food for

809
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,164
beer?

810
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,165
>> Oh, yeah, man.

811
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:24,791
Without a doubt, I'll give up a

812
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,668
hot dog for a beer, any day,

813
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,086
Jeff.

814
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:28,837
Out here in 122 degree weather,

815
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,172
I will take a beer any day,

816
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,173
buddy.

817
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:32,966
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

818
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,175
today's challenge.

819
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,176
Jamie, what happened between you

820
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,802
and Bobby Jon?

821
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,721
>> I celebrated when I won,

822
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,264
because I had so much energy.

823
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,974
And he hates losing, so he was

824
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,183
in my face yelling.

825
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:42,767
I'm from the South; only thing

826
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,937
I know how to do is yell back.

827
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,230
>> PROBST: Margaret, does this

828
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:47,856
tribe have good sportsmanship?

829
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,233
Are you guys good sports?

830
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,027
>> That's tough, Jeff,

831
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,571
because Judd is very vocal and

832
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,448
Jamie can be very expressive.

833
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,450
And they don't hesitate to just

834
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,784
blurt it all out there.

835
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,328
Sometimes you have to learn to

836
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,829
control your emotions when you

837
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,247
are on the ball field.

838
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,498
>> PROBST: Judd, chomping at the

839
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,499
bit-- what's on your mind?

840
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,083
>> I don't know what the heck

841
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:07,667
Margaret is talking about.

842
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,835
I mean, it's not like we're

843
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,836
being bad sportsmanships at all.

844
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,255
We just go out there and we give

845
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,423
it 120 damn percent, man.

846
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,049
Whatever it takes, we'll give

847
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:14,758
it.

848
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,800
That's what I did today, and

849
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,969
everybody ate good.

850
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,054
So, no matter what I do, I'm

851
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,638
giving it my damn all, man.

852
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,598
>> PROBST: Giving it your damn

853
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,223
all doesn't mean you are a good

854
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:22,766
sport or bad sport.

855
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,559
There is no equal sign between

856
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:25,643
those two words.

857
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,644
>> A win is a win, man.

858
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,188
If we did good, we are going to

859
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:28,813
go out there and go crazy, man.

860
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,607
It's like scoring a damn

861
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,025
touchdown in a football game.

862
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,193
That gives us more motivation to

863
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:33,902
keep going and going, man.

864
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,112
Drive it right to them, man.

865
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,280
Keep driving it to them.

866
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,281
That is what we are doing.

867
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,282
I mean, that's not bad

868
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,200
sportsmanship.

869
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,159
We just keep on driving and

870
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,160
driving, man.

871
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,161
We'll drive that ball all the

872
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,162
way down field until we score a

873
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,163
touchdown, man.

874
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,164
>> Judd.

875
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:46,706
>> You know what?

876
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,332
You probably never played a damn

877
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:47,916
sport in your life, anyway,

878
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:48,750
so you don't even know what it

879
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,709
is like, man, so you should just

880
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,710
shut up.

881
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,796
>> This is what happens all the

882
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,838
time.

883
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,798
When Judd gets vocal, Judd plows

884
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,718
over anybody in front of him.

885
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,886
He trash talks anybody he

886
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:00,804
doesn't like.

887
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:01,888
And that's not good

888
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,889
sportsmanship.

889
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,225
I'm not saying the whole tribe

890
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:05,809
is unsportsman but I have seen

891
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,811
it, especially from Judd.

892
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,937
>> PROBST: Judd, you look like

893
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,564
if I would let you, you would go

894
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,690
over and strangle Margaret right

895
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,691
now.

896
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,901
>> I'm just... you know, playing

897
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,611
sports my whole life, man,

898
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,613
I wouldn't consider myself a bad

899
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,572
sportsmanship.

900
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,573
>> Uh-huh.

901
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,574
>> This team that I have here,

902
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,575
man, is awesome.

903
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,576
I love it, man.

904
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,202
Except for Margaret, I love this

905
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,413
damn team, man.

906
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:26,955
>> PROBST: Cindy, does this

907
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,083
hostility between Judd and

908
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,292
Margaret concern you a little

909
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,794
bit?

910
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,920
>> Well, it concerns all of us

911
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,088
because we all have to live, you

912
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,840
know, in the same group together

913
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,841
and deal with it.

914
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,175
And when we have two people that

915
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,260
don't like each other very much,

916
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,386
it puts a little bit of

917
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,971
negativity into the air.

918
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,972
And negativity is not good for

919
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,974
the entire tribe.

920
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,891
>> PROBST: Margaret?

921
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,892
>> Judd doesn't listen to

922
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,893
anybody.

923
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,936
Judd only listens to Judd.

924
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,689
>> Let's ask the other team if

925
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,815
Judd listens to anybody.

926
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,817
Cindy, do I listen to everybody?

927
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,818
>> Yeah...

928
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,819
>> Okay, Rafe, do I listen to

929
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,279
everybody?

930
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,363
>> I... I honestly think that...

931
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,072
>> Rafe, have an opinion.

932
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:01,990
Just say yes or no.

933
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:02,949
>> I'm saying my opinion right

934
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:03,950
now.

935
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:04,951
Time-out.

936
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:05,952
>> Stephanie when you talk to

937
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:06,828
me, do I listen to you?

938
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,704
>> Yes, yes.

939
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,246
>> Do I listen to you?

940
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:08,830
Do I listen to you?

941
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,622
>> Yes.

942
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,331
>> There you go.

943
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,249
>> But this is what Judd does,

944
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,584
Judd bullies, and that's just

945
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,501
what he does.

946
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,002
>> You're full of it, man.

947
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,212
Get out of here.

948
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,255
>> PROBST: Rafe, put you on the

949
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,381
spot a little bit.

950
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,257
Are you intimidated a little bit

951
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:19,924
by Judd?

952
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,801
>> I'm really not.

953
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,052
I totally was really nervous

954
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:23,887
about being on the tribe with

955
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,888
Judd.

956
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,930
Judd has a temper, it's obvious,

957
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:26,931
but he has been good to me since

958
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:27,974
the day I walked on to this

959
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,268
tribe.

960
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,060
>> I just think Judd's high

961
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,020
strung.

962
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:32,854
He's a lot like me-- can't sit

963
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,439
still.

964
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,648
It's hard for him to keep....

965
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,733
>> When I first walked into

966
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,734
camp, she's telling me that I

967
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:38,902
have A.D.D.

968
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,278
That's how you approach me.

969
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,571
That is what you like to say.

970
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,655
She comes to camp:

971
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,031
"You have A.D.D.

972
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,657
Do you know that?"

973
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,283
When you first meet somebody, is

974
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,368
that something nice to say?

975
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,036
Is that a compliment?

976
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:48,870
I have A.D.D.?

977
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,038
>> The other problem with Judd

978
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,624
is he has a problem with recall.

979
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,750
>> Yeah.

980
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,375
Did you or did you not, soon as

981
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,877
you saw me, did you tell me that

982
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,046
I had A.D.D.?

983
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,756
Is that true or is that false?

984
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,924
Don't ask me such a stupid

985
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,342
question, man.

986
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,051
>> This is what it is like to

987
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,010
try to talk to him.

988
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,887
>> Yeah, because I don't want to

989
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,888
talk to you.

990
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,347
And don't talk to me.

991
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,057
I won't talk to you, man, that's

992
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,891
it.

993
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,976
>> PROBST: So, Judd, not a big

994
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,394
question who are you voting for.

995
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,604
>> Not a big question at all,

996
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,605
man.

997
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,940
>> PROBST: I have really never

998
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:17,982
ever seen anything like this,

999
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,859
and I will be honest with you, I

1000
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,986
have never seen such...

1001
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,487
>> Hey, Jeff, can I say

1002
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,863
something first?

1003
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,822
>> PROBST: Of course.

1004
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:25,323
>> Let me say something.

1005
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,451
She was so miserable that the

1006
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,745
other tribe wasn't coming back,

1007
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,622
and she got stuck with me.

1008
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,499
That's the bottom line, man.

1009
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,458
I'm telling you, that's what

1010
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,709
happened.

1011
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,252
>> What happened, Jeff, is

1012
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,546
within two hours, he was up that

1013
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,129
pyramid, already flipping over

1014
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,299
on us.

1015
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,050
It was four old Nakum,

1016
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,928
four old Yaxha.

1017
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,887
We had a chance to stay strong.

1018
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,972
He rolled over right away.

1019
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,014
>> You would you have done the

1020
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,141
same damn thing to me too, man,

1021
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,434
if you had the opportunity.

1022
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,269
>> I didn't. I didn't.

1023
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,270
>> Trust me.

1024
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,064
>> PROBST: Steph, how do you

1025
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,566
trust somebody who so quickly

1026
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,149
dismisses their old tribe and

1027
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,235
says, "No, you are my new

1028
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,236
friends now."

1029
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,404
>> Because that is his old

1030
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,154
tribe.

1031
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,155
We are the new tribe.

1032
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,115
I think he embraced his new

1033
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,324
tribe and is willing to go as

1034
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,826
far as we can go together with

1035
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,286
this tribe.

1036
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,328
What's he going to be like, "Oh,

1037
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,037
I'm not going to talk to you

1038
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,080
guys, because my old tribe is

1039
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,081
not on my tribe anymore"?

1040
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,542
It's retarded.

1041
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,585
>> PROBST: You know, tonight,

1042
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,544
watching what is going on with

1043
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,753
this group, there is a lot of

1044
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,171
hostility.

1045
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,506
Cindy, do you think it ends with

1046
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,799
tonight's Tribal Council?

1047
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,092
Do you get rid of the bad apple

1048
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,427
and now the tribe is sound and

1049
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,386
complete?

1050
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:28,970
>> I think it will be okay for

1051
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:29,929
awhile.

1052
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,015
We'll have to see what happens

1053
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:32,974
in the future.

1054
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,559
But I think we all know what we

1055
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,227
have to do.

1056
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,186
>> PROBST: Well, let's find out

1057
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,104
what it is you have to do.

1058
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,063
Rafe is the only person you

1059
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,065
cannot vote for.

1060
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,150
It is time to vote.

1061
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,235
Jamie, you're up.

1062
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,203
>> Hey, Margaret, if you leave

1063
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,080
this jungle now, it ain't soon

1064
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,874
enough, man.

1065
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,208
Get out, now.

1066
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,308
>> Judd, you are a bully.

1067
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,768
You are self-righteous, you're

1068
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,352
rude, you're profane-- no one

1069
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,187
like you deserves a million

1070
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,813
dollars.

1071
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,523
My vote is for you, buddy.

1072
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,660
>> PROBST: I will go tally the

1073
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,995
votes.

1074
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,797
Once the votes are read, the

1075
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,214
decision is final.

1076
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,173
The person voted out will be

1077
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,007
asked to leave the Tribal

1078
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,009
Council area immediately.

1079
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,678
I'll read the votes.

1080
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:56,557
First vote, Margaret.

1081
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,853
Judd.

1082
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,396
One vote Margaret, one vote

1083
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,316
Judd.

1084
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,861
Margaret: two votes Margaret.

1085
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,243
Margaret: three votes Margaret.

1086
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,705
Sixth person voted out of

1087
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,163
<i>Survivor: Guatemala.</i>

1088
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,164
Margaret, that's four, that's

1089
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,165
enough.

1090
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,293
You need to bring me your torch.

1091
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,011
Margaret, the tribe has spoken.

1092
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,057
It's time for you to go.

1093
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,816
Well, to paraphrase your words,

1094
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,484
tonight you got rid of the

1095
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,485
problem.

1096
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,111
If that's true, it should mean

1097
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,947
happy days at Nakum.

1098
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,157
As part of winning individual

1099
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,825
immunity today, Rafe earned the

1100
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:56,451
right to listen in on Yaxha's

1101
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,828
Tribal Council.

1102
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,454
Rafe, you will move over to the

1103
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,164
jury area.

1104
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,081
Everybody else, grab your

1105
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:02,290
torches.

1106
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,626
Head on back to camp.

1107
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,258
>> This is probably

1108
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,885
physically the most challenging

1109
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,178
thing that I've ever had to do

1110
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,137
in my life.

1111
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,680
And I'm so excited that I did

1112
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,139
it.

1113
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,225
Best wishes to Nakum tribe.

1114
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,852
I'm sure that a lot of tension

1115
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,853
will be gone now.

1116
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,146
But I think you will have

1117
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,065
a lot of troubles with Judd.

1118
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,067
So take care.

1119
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,449
>> PROBST: Now bring in Yaxha.

1120
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,147
>> PROBST: Rafe is going to be

1121
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,398
listening in on your Tribal

1122
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,399
Council tonight.

1123
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,943
It is a right he earned

1124
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:12,985
along with winning individual

1125
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,196
immunity today.

1126
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,697
Let's talk about today's

1127
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,033
challenge.

1128
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:19,617
Bobby Jon, what happened with

1129
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,201
you and Jamie?

1130
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,745
>> I just got in the heat of the

1131
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,913
moment, you know.

1132
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,081
Sometimes when two males are

1133
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:25,706
competing against each other,

1134
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,458
it's like two bulls in a ring.

1135
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,793
You just get aggressive and you

1136
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,377
know it just kind of came out.

1137
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,379
Two male people, a lot of

1138
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,213
testosterone built up and we

1139
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,716
both want to win.

1140
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,968
>> PROBST: Gary, do you consider

1141
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,553
Nakum to be good sports?

1142
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,762
>> I would say, yes.

1143
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,180
Every once in a while, I would

1144
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,598
say maybe Jamie has a tendency

1145
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,182
to get a little excited and

1146
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,184
maybe talk some trash our way,

1147
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,562
but on the whole, I would say

1148
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,563
yes.

1149
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,564
>> PROBST: Brian, you come

1150
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,898
into this game with a certain

1151
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,525
tendency to work up here.

1152
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,693
And now are you being tested

1153
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,944
with your body.

1154
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,320
Do you feel a change happening?

1155
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,446
>> I have always been an

1156
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,489
athletic person.

1157
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,740
So I knew I could take whatever

1158
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,408
was handed to me.

1159
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,576
So when it's time to bring out

1160
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,660
the physical, I will definitely

1161
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,661
bring it out.

1162
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,745
But when it's time to bring out

1163
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,621
the mental, I'll have that ready

1164
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,205
too.

1165
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,040
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, what's

1166
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:08,916
your take on Brian?

1167
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,500
>> I mean, if you want to find

1168
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,377
a kamikaze that will bust a

1169
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,670
wedge, this is the man who about

1170
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,671
do it.

1171
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,714
>> PROBST: A kamikaze that is

1172
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,173
going to bust a wedge.

1173
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,383
>> This boy right here, he's

1174
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,051
constantly thinking<i> Survivor.</i>

1175
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,553
The guy knows his game.

1176
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,514
He is just a good old boy, you

1177
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,348
know?

1178
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,684
He would be a great neighbor.

1179
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,685
>> PROBST: Danni, did you ever

1180
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,895
think you would say Bobby Jon

1181
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:29,979
say about Brian, "He's just a

1182
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,939
good ol' boy"?

1183
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,065
>> You know, our first

1184
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,567
impression of Brian, when we

1185
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,861
were over at Nakum, was he's

1186
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,445
strong, and he's just such a

1187
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,864
gentleman, too, it is all I can

1188
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:40,865
say about him.

1189
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:41,616
He is definitely strong, he's

1190
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,909
smart but he is a classy, classy

1191
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,076
guy.

1192
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,661
>> PROBST: All right, now let's

1193
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,204
talk about Amy's chronic

1194
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,040
injury to that ankle.

1195
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,583
So Amy, how is the ankle?

1196
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,584
>> It's good.

1197
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,835
I tweaked it a little bit, but I

1198
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,836
tripped and fell too.

1199
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,837
>> PROBST: Tweaked it a little

1200
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,838
bit?

1201
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,131
>> Yup.

1202
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,341
>> PROBST: Brandon, had to be a

1203
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,425
little impressed because, after

1204
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,469
Amy went down, she could barely

1205
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,261
get off of that field, only to

1206
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,639
turn around and have to go back

1207
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,264
out again.

1208
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,558
>> Oh, man, Jeff, you have no

1209
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,226
idea how impressed I was.

1210
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,187
I mean, Amy got that look on her

1211
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,022
face and just started going at

1212
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,690
it, limping and cussing and

1213
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,691
everything.

1214
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,984
I was, like, man, you know,

1215
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,444
that is what I like to see-- I

1216
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,780
mean, go above the odds, you

1217
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,323
know, and Amy did.

1218
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,157
I'm like...

1219
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,533
I was so impressed with her

1220
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,534
today.

1221
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,577
>> PROBST: So Bobby Jon, there

1222
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,870
doesn't appear to be an obvious

1223
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,871
weak link.

1224
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,872
But you got to get rid of

1225
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:30,873
somebody-- what do you base it

1226
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,625
on?

1227
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,960
>> Jeff, that's a real good

1228
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:34,961
question.

1229
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,128
I think today we all did a lot

1230
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,797
of soul-searching and we know

1231
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,215
that nobody has done anything

1232
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,925
wrong to leave.

1233
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,301
Everybody's giving 110% in

1234
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:42,593
a challenge.

1235
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,595
Everybody is giving 110% around

1236
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,596
camp.

1237
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,597
You know, you look up, and

1238
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,556
somebody's throwing a corn cake

1239
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,766
in your mouth, you know,

1240
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,101
it going to be a tough

1241
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,143
one but like you said, it's

1242
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:51,769
going to happen and this is the

1243
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,063
way it is.

1244
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:54,981
>> PROBST: All right, one more

1245
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,524
thing before the vote.

1246
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,192
In addition to Rafe being able

1247
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,694
to sit in and listen to your

1248
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,946
Tribal Council, he also earned

1249
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,698
the right to give one of you

1250
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,741
immunity.

1251
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,954
Okay, Rafe, here's how it will

1252
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,247
work:

1253
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:11,872
Write the name of the person you

1254
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,000
want to give immunity to, put it

1255
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,793
in an envelope, seal it, put it

1256
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,670
in the voting urn.

1257
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,629
Then come down and get your

1258
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,256
torch and head on back to your

1259
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,048
camp.

1260
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:21,841
Go make your vote.

1261
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:22,466
>> Okay.

1262
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,243
>> PROBST: You can leave your

1263
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:50,911
immunity necklace behind.

1264
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,415
Good night.

1265
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:01,505
Okay, Yaxha, Rafe's choice for

1266
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,590
immunity will remain a secret

1267
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,676
until after your vote.

1268
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,803
Gary, you're up.

1269
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,858
>> This would be the outwit part

1270
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,445
of "outwit, outplay, outlast."

1271
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,001
>> Brian, you are a great kid

1272
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,377
with a ton of heart.

1273
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,003
You have done a remarkable job.

1274
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,631
You should be proud of yourself.

1275
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,764
>> PROBST: I will go tally the

1276
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,016
votes.

1277
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,236
Once the votes are read, the

1278
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,237
decision is final.

1279
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,196
The person voted out will be

1280
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,114
asked to leave the tribal

1281
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:08,656
council area immediately.

1282
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,033
I'll read the votes.

1283
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,663
First vote, Bobby Jon.

1284
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,876
Brian-- one vote Brian,

1285
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,504
one vote Bobby Jon.

1286
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,466
Brian: two votes Brian.

1287
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,472
Brian: that's three votes Brian,

1288
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,101
one vote Bobby Jon.

1289
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,479
Brian: that's four votes, that's

1290
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,148
enough to vote you out.

1291
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,899
You have one shot left.

1292
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,527
Rafe's immunity.

1293
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:52,032
Brian, Rafe gave immunity to

1294
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,243
Gary.

1295
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,286
Seventh person voted out of

1296
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,788
<i>Survivor: Guatemala</i> is Brian.

1297
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,290
>> Good jobs guys, good luck.

1298
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,668
>> Good luck, Brian.

1299
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,550
>> PROBST: Brian, the tribe has

1300
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,594
spoken.

1301
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,388
>> Good luck, guys.

1302
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,771
>> PROBST: Well, I got to hand

1303
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:23,522
it to you.

1304
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,690
You did a great job of pumping

1305
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,983
Brian up and making him feel

1306
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,860
secure.

1307
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,653
And then you cut his throat.

1308
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,489
If it could happen to him,

1309
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,489
it could happen to you.

1310
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,115
Grab your torches, head back to

1311
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:33,532
camp.

1312
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,533

<i>Survivor,</i> Amy confronts Gary.

1323
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,640
>> Give me the lowdown

1324
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,641
on Mr. Gary Hawkins,

1325
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,267
ex-professional football player.

1326
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,268
>> Yeah, I wish.

1327
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,102
>> If you are and I find out

1328
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:02,645
after, I'm going to beat you

1329
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,562
down.

1330
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,357
>> PROBST: And Nakum gets an

1331
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,358
unexpected visit.

1332
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,359
>> Nakum!

1333
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,276
>> I think the other tribe is

1334
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,277
coming to visit.

1335
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,278
>> I think the other tribe is

1336
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,446
here.

1337
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,490
>> Hi!

1338
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,454
>> Well, I certainly went down

1339
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,080
fighting-- I know I played this

1340
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,581
game very hard.

1341
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,416
I did everything I could and I

1342
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,000
did not see that coming, which

1343
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,710
is how I wanted to go out.

1344
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,962
So the fact they pulled one over

1345
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,213
on me, I'm really proud of them.

1346
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,297
I'm glad they are playing the

1347
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,298
game.

1348
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,216
I never really had to push

1349
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:32,967
myself like that before.

1350
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,009
So I will take from this

1351
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,010
experience the fact that I was

1352
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:35,511
able to go into a really

1353
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,595
difficult situation and come out
