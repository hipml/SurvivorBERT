00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,544
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:03,128
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,170
Drop your buffs, we are

4
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,171
switching tribes.

5
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,131
The fans and favorites were

6
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,550
mixed, putting an even number of

7
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,135
fans and favorites on both

8
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,678
sides.

9
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,303
>> Oh, don't look so pissed off.

10
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,139
>> JEFF: After the switch, it

11
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,140
became obvious how much the fans

12
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,267
suffered.

13
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,685
>> I'm amazed they're still

14
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:19,936
alive, poor things.

15
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:20,937
They should be dead.

16
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,896
>> JEFF: And how much the

17
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,022
favorites thrived.

18
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,023
>> Those guys are tough as

19
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:24,232
nails.

20
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,484
>> JEFF: The new Airai gelled

21
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,402
immediately...

22
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,361
Airai wins!

23
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,946
...and went on a winning streak.

24
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,156
But they lost Jonathan due it an

25
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:31,990
injury.

26
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,032
>> I couldn't have done anything

27
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,742
else.

28
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,451
They did everything they could

29
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:41,499
do.

30
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,125
>> JEFF: On Exile Island, Ozzy

31
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,210
found the hidden immunity idol

32
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,755
and replaced it with a fake one

33
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,799
as a decoy, which was discovered

34
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,720
by Jason.

35
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,346
>> I guess this is the hidden

36
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,806
immunity idol.

37
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,766
>> Help me, help me, somebody.

38
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,641
>> JEFF: Cirie is losing it.

39
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,768
>> Help me, help me!

40
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,977
>> JEFF: Airai has it!

41
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,103
When the new Malakal lost their

42
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,605
third challenge in a row, Chet

43
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,065
volunteered to be voted out.

44
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,318
And at tribal council Erik

45
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,152
received two throwaway votes...

46
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,320
>> I vowed never to vote for

47
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,237
Chet.

48
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,113
>> JEFF: ...and Chet got the

49
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,073
rest...

50
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,033
Sixth person voted out

51
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:15,867
of<i> Survivor: Fans Versus</i>

52
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,826
<i>Favorites,</i> Chet.

53
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,203
...leaving two fans, Tracy and

54
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,704
Erik, on Ozzy's tribe.

55
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,080
13 are left.

56
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,332
Who will be voted out tonight?

57
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,299
>> A lot of crab.

58
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,343
>> Wow.

59
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:39,933
>> I think we should have the

60
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,809
damn thing cut open right now.

61
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,018
It's only laying two eggs

62
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:42,227
anyway.

63
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,144
>> Well, let's kill them right

64
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,312
now, all three of them.

65
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,523
Oh, the chicken issue.

66
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,816
Come on, girls.

67
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,358
I think Tracy started it for

68
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,234
some reason.

69
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,236
I'm going to blame it on Tracy.

70
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,445
We've got three chickens that

71
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,738
lay three eggs almost every

72
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,280
single day.

73
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,491
Hey, it's a renewable resource.

74
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,700
You want to take out a renewable

75
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,827
resource?

76
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,078
That makes no sense.

77
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,287
>> Like, you're not going to

78
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,497
kill them as soon as some more

79
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,748
people get off so you can have

80
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,290
more meat for yourself?

81
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,043
>> No.

82
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:07,335
No.

83
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,379
Not going to happen.

84
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,171
>> Yeah.

85
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,089
>> It doesn't matter.

86
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:11,923
It doesn't matter the way this

87
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:12,715
game works.

88
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,550
>> It's three weeks, three

89
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,509
chickens.

90
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,593
>> Tracy is breeding a lot of

91
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,261
insecurity around camp.

92
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,221
Of course, she's trying to play

93
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:18,513
the game.

94
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,347
She's trying to scramble to save

95
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,390
her own ass, but we don't need

96
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,601
that.

97
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,144
Look at this-- crabs.

98
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,646
We've got massive crabs.

99
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,064
There's plenty of other food.

100
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:28,690
We just have to, like, get it.

101
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,358
>> Ozzy is in control of this

102
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,402
tribe.

103
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,486
He's like the kingpin.

104
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,571
He tells you what you can and

105
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,613
can't do.

106
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,698
He tells you when you're going

107
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,490
to eat.

108
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,408
He cooks the food and then we

109
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,075
have to wait until Ozzy says eat

110
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:39,284
it.

111
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,077
It's crazy.

112
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,036
I mean, it's just crazy.

113
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,996
Ozzy is going to win this thing

114
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,913
if we don't get him out of this

115
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,874
game.

streak.

122
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,655
I just want to get clean.

123
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,658
Oh, yeah.

124
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,993
Another day in the lap of

luxury.

126
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,666
How do we do it, ladies?

127
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,417
>> They complain about the rain.

128
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,336
But they didn't get wet because

129
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,420
we were in the cave.

130
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,922
I mean, you could be like it was

131
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,799
before-- outside, under a bush,

132
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,342
getting pummeled by this rain.

133
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,803

134

true essence of the stench

135
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,431
and this funk.

136
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,476
>> And how filthy we are right

137
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,560
now.

138
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,395
>> Deal with the funk.

139
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:30,979
It couldn't have smelled any

140
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,188
better than what they were in

141
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:32,855
before.

142
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,606
Just relax.

143
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,315
We're not going to be here

144
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,233
forever.

145
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,067
This is a game called

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,526
called<i> Survivor.</i>

147
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,443

148
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,486
there's...

149
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,738
>> A sign of hope?

150
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,322

151
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,909
>> Is my face just dirty?

152
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,077
>> This is just the stupidest

153
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,953
thing I ever did in my life.

154
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,538
Probably because I'm just... I'm

155
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,747
crabby.

156
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,374
I'm not a morning person.

157
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,709

158
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,794
>> The moods out here are you're

159
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,504
on one day and feeling good, and

160
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,382
the next day it's just all crap.

161
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,591
Today, this morning is a crap

162
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,468
day.

163
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,469
>> Could we just get a day of

164
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,679
sunshine, please?

165
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,557
Wash and dry our clothes.

166
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,767
>> Oh, my god.

167
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,519
Thinking of home and my washer

168
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,354
and dryer and my food and my

169
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,481
daughter and my husband, and...

170
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,859
Well, it's going to make me cry.

171
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,235
It's going to make me want to be

172
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,446
there.

173
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,905
Nope, still here.

174
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,907
Damn!

175
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,630
>> Ozzy is amazing.

176
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,798
I honestly like Ozzy.

177
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,008
He's an awesome guy, and I want

178
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,092
to learn.

179
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,177
I want to grow.

180
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,344
I want to go outside the small

181
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,055
scope that I've lived in and

182
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,264
just see a lot more of the

183
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:48,431
world.

184
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,557
And everybody thinks Ozzy is,

185
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,558
look, the wonderkid, or

186
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,434
whatever.

187
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,269
And I'm just like, "I can do

188
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,103
that.

189
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:54,979
I can climb a coconut tree,

190
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,855
too."

191
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:56,856
>> Some of them look like

192
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,066
they're stable, but then you'll

193
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:58,983
pull it, and they'll just pull

194
00:05:59,067 --> 00:05:59,901
right off.

195
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,194
When you grab the green palm

196
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:01,778
frond, give it a little test.

197
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,364
>> Erik and Ozzy are like<i> The</i>

198
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,950
<i>Lion King,</i> the father, when he

199
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,494
was teaching the cub.

200
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,370
And you can just see, like,

201
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:11,579
stars.

202
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,456
Whenever he says Ozzy's name,

203
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,624
like, stardust comes out of his

204
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,958
mouth.

205
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,044
Erik just is like, "Ozzy..."

206
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,337
>> A couple of more steps and

207
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:19,670
you're there.

208
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,422
>> Wow.

209
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,966
>> Cool, huh?

210
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,510
Good job, dude.

211
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,428
>> They're bonding right now.

212
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,223
>> Oh, my god.

213
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,600
>> Yes!

214
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,477
>> You've got good nuts now.

215
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,562
>> I think if Ozzy were to

216
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,564
propose marriage to Erik right

217
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:43,236
now, done deal.

218
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,695
>> I want to move the boat.

219
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,072
>> Okay.

220
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:46,614
>> To the back beach.

221
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,574
>> Oh, wow.

222
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,909
>> It makes way more sense to

223
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,244
have it on that side.

224
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:51,619
It will be fast.

225
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,205
>> They asked me to help move

226
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,456
the boat to the back beach.

227
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,458
We'd better be able to get back,

228
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,918
I know that, before it's

229
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,838
sundown.

230
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,506
Everybody knows, it's no secret,

231
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,633
I'm not a strong swimmer, but

232
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,927
being a team player, you think

233
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,220
you can get more fish on the

234
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,888
back beach, I'll help you row to

235
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,432
the back beach.

236
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,479
When we get way out in the

237
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,273
middle of nowhere, and Ozzy

238
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:20,857
decides, "well, the reef is

239
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,441
right there, come on, we can get

240
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,609
really big fish at the reef,"

241
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,236
I'm nervous as hell.

242
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,489
I've never been out that far in

243
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,992
the ocean in a little wooden

244
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,327
boat.

245
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,875
>> I can see!

246
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,877
I can see what you can see!

247
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,631
Yeah, you.

248
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,633
>> Just trust me for a little

249
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,177
bit.

250
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,219
There could be a giant clam out

251
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,179
there that will feed us for the

252
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:51,554
rest of the time.

253
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,681
Maybe there will be a pearl in

254
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,807
there I can give Cirie for

255
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,517
paddling out here.

256
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,061
>> Ozzy is about<i> numero uno,</i> and

257
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,522
that's Oscar.

258
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,695
Yay, reef, reef.

259
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,697
>> Cirie!

260
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,035
Oh, you're unhappy!

261
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,411
>> So they'll have this little

262
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,287
reef adventure at my expense

263
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,163
today, but it won't happen

264
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,582
again.

265
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,504
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

266
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,844
Airai getting your first look at

267
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,095
the new Malakal tribe.

268
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,764
Chet voted out at the last

269
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,806
tribal council.

270
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,684
You guys ready to get to today's

271
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,436
challenge?

272
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,145
>> Yeah.

273
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:41,896
>> Yeah.

274
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,189
>> JEFF: This is a traditional

275
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,482
Micronesian money stone.

276
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,275
For years, these stones were the

277
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,485
currency in Micronesia.

278
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,110
The larger the stone, the more

279
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:48,736
value.

280
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,695
Today they're a part of your

281
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,572
challenge.

282
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,782
For today's challenge, four of

283
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,033
you will be blindfolded.

284
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:54,700
The other two tribe members will

285
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,661
use verbal direction to guide

286
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,164
you as you push a giant money

287
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,582
stone through the jungle course.

288
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,918
Along the way, you will crush

289
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:04,794
the tiles at four stations

290
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,214
revealing a pair of smaller

291
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,548
money stones.

292
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,300
You'll then use those eight

293
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,135
stones to solve a rotating cog

294
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,179
puzzle.

295
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,639
First tribe to get it right wins

296
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,682
reward.

297
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,307
Want to know what you're playing

298
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,558
for?

299
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,476
>> Yeah.

300
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,352
>> JEFF: Close your eyes and

301
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,520
imagine you're under a beautiful

302
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,230
refreshing waterfall.

303
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:24,730
>> Oh!

304
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,773
>> Oh, god!

305
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,774
>> JEFF: And you're cleaning

306
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,651
your body, and you're washing

307
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:28,901
your hair.

308
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,569
>> Oh, you got to...

309
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,028
>> That's your reward.

310
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,239
It is the herbal essence great

311
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,366
escape spa.

312
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,951
The winning tribe will be taken

313
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,160
to an island.

314
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:38,786
You'll have plenty of products.

315
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,705
You can wash up, get clean.

316
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,498
When you're finished, a nice

317
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,125
little snack to round out the

318
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,376
day.

319
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,294
Worth playing for?

320
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,128
>> Yes.

321
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,170
>> Absolutely.

322
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,088
>> JEFF: In addition, the

323
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,298
winning tribe will send one

324
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,465
member from the losing tribe to

325
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,508
Exile Island.

326
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,092
You will also choose somebody,

327
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,303
again, from your own tribe to

328
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,596
join them.

329
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,138
Airai, you have one extra

330
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,597
member.

331
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,473
Who is going to sit this one

332
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,308
out?

333
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,142
>> I am.

334
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,018
>> JEFF: All right, Natalie,

335
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,060
take a spot over here.

336
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,562
Give the rest of you a minute to

337
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,521
strategize.

338
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,982
We'll get started.

339
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,109
All right, here we go.

340
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,652
For reward.

341
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,405
Survivors ready?

342
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:14,655
Go!

343
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,407
>> Come on, guys.

344
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,116
Come on, come on, come on, come

345
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:17,992
on, come on, come on, come on.

346
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:18,784
Keep coming.

347
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,410
>> Okay, follow my voice, follow

348
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,411
my voice.

349
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,162
Keep coming straight.

350
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:21,912
Keep coming, keep coming, keep

351
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,705
coming.

352
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,748
>> Come on, straight, straight.

353
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,291
Pivot to your left, to your

354
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:25,875
left.

355
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,918
The other way!

356
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,170
>> That's right.

357
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,755
>> Cirie, you're backwards.

358
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,256
Right, right, right.

359
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,715
>> Okay, stop!

360
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,967
Come across!

361
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,552
>> JEFF: Malakal is through

362
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:37,720
their first tile.

363
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,054
>> Keep going.

364
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:38,721
Okay, you're at the thing.

365
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,473
You feel it?

366
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,390
You've got to pivot left a

367
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,141
little.

368
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:42,767
Okay, straight.

369
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,059
Keep going!

370
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,435
Keep going.

371
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,019
Straight.

372
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:45,686
There you go.

373
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,604
You broke the stone.

374
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,271
>> JEFF: Airai is through the

375
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:47,980
first tile.

376
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:48,606
They have their first two money

377
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,607
stones.

378
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,274
>> To your left.

379
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:50,983
No, no, I'm sorry.

380
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:51,734
To your right.

381
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,068
To your right.

382
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,361
>> Okay, now toward the left,

383
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,028
toward the left, toward the

384
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,737
left, toward the left.

385
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,071
>> Now back up.

386
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,447
Just back straight up.

387
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,156
>> A little right, a little

388
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:57,865
right.

389
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,657
Right.

390
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,325
Keep going, keep going, keep

391
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,034
going, keep going.

392
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:00,785
>> Okay, now straight over it

393
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,077
this way!

394
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,453
Got it, got it!

395
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,245
>> JEFF: Malakal smashes their

396
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,413
second tile.

397
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,289
>> Perfect, perfect!

398
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,665
Straight.

399
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,541
Okay, you broke it.

400
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,542
>> JEFF: Airai smashes their

401
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,169
second tile.

00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,045
>> Over here.

403
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:11,921
Come on, come on!

404
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,755
>> Haul ass!

405
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,047
Go, go, go!

406
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,757
>> Stop!

407
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,008
Now come forward.

408
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,093
Slow, slow.

409
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:17,968
>> JEFF: Malakal lined up for

410
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,512
their third tile, and they have

411
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,429
it.

412
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,305
>> Over here!

413
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,264
>> JEFF: One tile left to break

414
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,182
before you start working on that

415
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,683
puzzle.

416
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,518
>> Come straight towards me,

417
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:25,935
straight toward me.

418
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,520
It didn't break.

419
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,479
It didn't break.

420
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,397
Back it up.

421
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,356
Back it up, back it up.

422
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,190
>> Which way do we move it now?

423
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,108
>> Shut up and listen!

424
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,275
>> Pivot right, pivot right.

425
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,235
Now come straight through, come

426
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,194
straight through.

427
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:35,986
Yes.

428
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,946
>> JEFF: Airai smashes their

429
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,863

>> Turn to your right a little

431
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:39,865
more.

432
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,991
Straight across, right now!

433
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:41,951
>> JEFF: Cirie not messing

434
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:42,952
around.

435
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:43,869
They're straight through.

436
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,995
Malakal has all eight.

437
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:45,913
Start working on the puzzle.

438
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,790
Three people.

439
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,251
>> Okay, you're almost at the

440
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,252
last one guys.

441
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,211
Keep coming straight.

442
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:52,962
Okay, now, perfect.

443
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:53,504
You should be able to come

444
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,630
straight through.

445
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,339
Yes, good job, good job, good

446
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,006
job.

447
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,966
>> JEFF: Airai has their eighth

448
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,134
and final money stone.

449
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,552
Start working on the puzzle.

450
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,220
It's Erik, Cirie, and Ozzy

451
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,264
working for Malakal.

452
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:03,889
Eliza, Kathy, and James working

453
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,434
the puzzle for Airai.

454
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,893
This puzzle will only go

455
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,564
together one way.

456
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,982
That does not mean certain

457
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,983
pieces won't fit in and appear

458
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,819
to be right and still be wrong.

459
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,529
>> Okay.

460
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,989
>> JEFF: It is trial and error.

461
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,991
>> There we go.

462
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,534
>> I don't think you have to

463
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:23,993
force it that much.

464
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,911
>> JEFF: James hoping it's in

465
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,829
the right spot.

466
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,329
>> This one right here.

467
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:27,955
This one right here.

468
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:28,956
This is right.

469
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,918
>> JEFF: Eliza, James, Kathy,

470
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,005
not making much progress.

471
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,383
>> That's it, that's it, Ozzy.

472
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,051
>> JEFF: Malakal thinks they're

473
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,344
getting closer.

474
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,096
>> We need one more.

475
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,222
Do we got it?

476
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:45,973
>> We got it!

477
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:46,182
Jeff!

478
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,850
>> JEFF: Malakal thinks they

479
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,226
have it.

480
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,061
Malakal wins reward!

481
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,947
>> Yes!

482
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,032
>> JEFF: Malakal,

483
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:03,908
congratulations.

484
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,241
>> Thank you.

485
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,618
>> JEFF: Nice big reward coming

486
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,368
your way.

487
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,620
First things first-- choosing

488
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,204
somebody from Airai to go to

489
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,955
Exile Island.

490
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,041
>> Jason.

491
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,125
>> JEFF: Jason, you're going

492
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,335
back to Exile Island.

493
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,212
Now, Malakal, you have to choose

494
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,214
somebody from your own tribe to

495
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,590
go to Exile Island, which means

496
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,174
they will not go on the spa

497
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,967
reward.

498
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,927
>> Oh!

499
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,803
>> Wow!

500
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,930
>> Can you take one for the

501
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,557
team?

502
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,558
>> Me?

503
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,101
Oh, god.

504
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:31,894
I'm going to Exile.

505
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,020
>> JEFF: All right, Tracy,

506
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,021
Jason, get your stuff.

507
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,024
The boat's waiting on you.

508
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,279
Airai, got nothing for you.

509
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,197
Grab your stuff.

510
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,449
Head back to camp.

511
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,036
Malakal, come get your stuff.

512
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,081
The boat is waiting for you.

513
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,849
>> Yeah!

514
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,561
Oh, damn!

515
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,980
(<i> cheering</i> )

516
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,649
>> Muffins.

517
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,818
>> Cookies!

518
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,570
>> It was so funny to see Erik.

519
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,530
For one, he was experiencing a

520
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,240
reward for the first time since

521
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,491
he's been here.

522
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,035
>> I am so happy right now.

523
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,954
>> It was really cool.

524
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,789
I mean, he's like a wide-eyed

525
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,374
kid in a candy store.

526
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,209
It made me feel proud that we

527
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,461
were able to win and bring him

528
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,921
in and let him experience this.

529
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,090
>> That was nice.

530
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,383
>> Yeah.

531
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,135
>> What is that?

532
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,219
I think that's our shower right

533
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,596
there.

534
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,597
>> Yeah.

535
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,514
>> You want to go shower?

536
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,432
>> I'll come scrub your back

537
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,476
when you're halfway through.

538
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,894
>> Oh, yeah!

539
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,270
>> Oh, my gosh.

540
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,188
>> Oh, yeah!

541
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,231
>> Ami, come on!

542
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,524
>> I'm getting naked.

543
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,610
I don't care.

544
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,572
>> Oh, my god!

545
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:12,911
>> Everyone, get naked.

546
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,122
>> My goodness.

547
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,165
Ooh-wee.

548
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,500
I don't know.

549
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,543
I just looked over and there's,

550
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,544
like, a couple of pair of boobs,

551
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,795
and Ozzy's head smack dab in the

552
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,047
middle.

553
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,548
I'm like, "Okay."

554
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,383
The only thing funnier was Erik

555
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,010
drooling from the sight.

556
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,139
(<i> laughs</i> )

557
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,350
Hey, to each his own.

558
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,142
If you feel free like that, then

559
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:40,397
by all means, get free.

560
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,859
I just wouldn't do it.

561
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,278
>> Oh, oh, man.

562
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,988
This is as perfect as I could

563
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,074
have ever hoped for.

564
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,165
>> This came on so fast.

565
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,124
>> It's a freaking mon-freaking-

566
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:04,046
soon.

567
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,507
>> It just came out of nowhere.

568
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,008
>> It's completely different.

569
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,885
You watch this show at home, and

570
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,178
when they show the rain, they

571
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,306
show it for, like, 30 seconds.

572
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,808
They're not showing that you're

573
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,685
standing in the rain or trying

574
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,227
to sleep while you're being

575
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,020
rained on for five, six hours

576
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,357
straight, non-stop.

577
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,373
We had to stand out there, and

578
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,082
James went out in the rain and

579
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,166
caught a clam, and we had to sit

580
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,127
around and eat a raw clam,

581
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,670
because there's no fire, and

582
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,713
you're all just digging in it

583
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,505
with your hands like you're

584
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,631
animals.

585
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,215
>> You guys okay if I put a

586
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,175
little on my lemon?

587
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,176
>> You people are disgusting.

588
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,429
I was just talking about how I

589
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,388
think...

590
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,472
>> And it's full of sand, and

591
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,015
it's full of dirt.

592
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,225
And the coconut you're cleaning

593
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,435
falls on the ground, but you

594
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,269
don't care.

595
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:00,894
You just put it back in, because

596
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,354
it's food.

597
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,481
And it's just savagery.

598
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,941
It's like you're cavemen, you

599
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:07,860
know?

600
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,653
Never in a million years would I

601
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,822
ever do this twice.

602
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,873
>> Is it scary in there?

603
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,082
>> It just rained, and it

604
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,334
rained, and we crawled way down

605
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,252
into the cave.

606
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,337
And it's miserable.

607
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,672
And it's awful.

608
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,048
And it's dirty.

609
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,843
And you don't even know what's

610
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,052
dead and crawling.

611
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,596
Son of a bitch!

612
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,306
We sleep in the caves with bats

613
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,808
and rats and crawly things.

614
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,268
>> Ow!

615
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,021
>> It's hard to explain that

616
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,105
experience, that it's just...

617
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,274
it's just so uncomfortable.

618
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,609
It's so unpleasant.

619
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,777
And I said it myself the other

620
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,819
day, "This is the stupidest

621
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,737
thing I've ever done in my life.

622
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,613
This is the dumbest thing I've

623
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,823
ever done."

624
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,217
Well, when I woke up this

625
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,301
morning, I hadn't gotten any

626
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,219
sleep.

627
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,137
Again, we were in the cave.

628
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,680
It rained all night.

629
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,306
And I was looking for some kind

630
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,101
of strength, and I couldn't find

631
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,812
it.

632
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,896
I was thinking of putting some

633
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,939
wood on the beach, but I don't

634
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:27,940
know how high the tide will come

635
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:28,982
in.

636
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:29,817
Can I have one more hug, one

637
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,651
more?

638
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,819
I need one more hug to get me

639
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,320
through the day.

640
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,447
I'm just so out of it, James.

641
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,740
>> It's okay.

642
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:43,121
Everybody has their days.

643
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,665
>> You know, I was trying to

644
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,500
send... it sounds so stupid.

645
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,168
I was trying to send, like,

646
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,379
vibes to my daughter, Maddie.

647
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,380
You know, "Can you hear me?

648
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,339
You can feel me?

649
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,132
I need your help.

650
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,844
I need your help to help me

651
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,096
through this because I can't do

652
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,138
this."

653
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,390
And I couldn't... I couldn't

654
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,224
feel her.

655
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,686
I can't feel my family.

656
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,278
I don't know what it is, but I'm

657
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,280
just downward spiraling, and I

658
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,865
can't take another minute, I

659
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,033
can't.

660
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,243
I can't.

661
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,828
I know it's sunny, it's

662
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,412
beautiful, it's like, "Ooh,"

663
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,289
But I can't.

664
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:25,914
I can't be here one more minute.

665
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,791
I can't take it.

666
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,876
And I just want you guys to be

667
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,918
okay and not hate me for it.

668
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,961
I just can't take it one more

669
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,213
minute, I can't.

670
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,719
>> You have to be 100% sure.

671
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,928
>> I'm 100% sure.

672
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,971
I can't.

673
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:41,430
I can't do it anymore.

674
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,307
>> Not to make light of how

675
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,517
you're feeling, but we all feel

676
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,685
like that today.

677
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,352
We're all going bananas.

678
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,022
And I'm not trying to make light

679
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,523
of what's going on in your head.

680
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,399
>> It's a tough day.

681
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,193
>> It's just a hard day.

682
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,236
>> Let's walk in the sun a

683
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,528
little bit.

684
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,739
>> Come here, come here.

685
00:19:58,822 --> 00:19:59,239
>> I want to go now.

686
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,867
>> It's okay.

687
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,201
I want them to come and get a

688
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,411
boat and pick me up and take me

689
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,704
away, because I can't do this

690
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,955
anymore.

691
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,915
I can't.

692
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,916
I tried so hard.

693
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,917
>> I know, sweetie, I know.

694
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,168
>> I tried so hard.

695
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:11,460
>> I know.

696
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,378
>> I think it was a horrible

697
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,672
night, and I think it just took

698
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,715
its toll on Kathy.

699
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,050
Kathy just really got in her

700
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,176
head today.

701
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,636
Like, everything just compiled

702
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,179
and built up one upon another,

703
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,263
and she's just severely

704
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,015
depressed.

705
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,558
>> I just want to go.

706
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,185
>> She just came up to us on the

707
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,603
beach, bawling, crying, and told

708
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,021
us that she can't take another

709
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,481
day out here and she has to go.

710
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,565
Like, she's done.

711
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,651
She's quitting the game.

712
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,457
>> JEFF: Hello, guys.

713
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,333
>> Hi.

714
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,334
>> Hi.

715
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,211
>> JEFF: So, well, I got word

716
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,379
that you wanted to see me.

717
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,296
You've had enough?

718
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,882
What's going on?

719
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,342
It's 19 days you've been out

720
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,301
here.

721
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,387
>> I know.

722
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,304
>> JEFF: Let me come over... let

723
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:08,141
me just come over here.

724
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,645
>> I kind of sat on the boat for

725
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,522
a while today, and I couldn't

726
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,941
feel my family, you know?

727
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,236
And I'm never leaving my baby

728
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,445
girl or husband again ever for

729
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,116
this amount of time, ever again.

730
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,659
>> JEFF: So what is it that...

731
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,660
you've had a tough time out

732
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,703
here.

733
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,829
You've had as tough... you've

734
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,747
had it as tough as anybody with

735
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,208
all the time on Exile.

736
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,501
But you've weathered all that.

737
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,129
So you want to leave, you're

738
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,296
leaving.

739
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:38,880
There's no... I'm not here to

740
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,381
talk you into staying.

741
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,299
That's for sure.

742
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,092
>> Right.

743
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:42,926
>> JEFF: I just want to

744
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,802
understand it.

745
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,511
>> I was doing it for everybody

746
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,430
else.

747
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,723
Doing it for my husband.

748
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,974
Doing it for my sister who wants

749
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,517
to live vicariously through me.

750
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,893
I don't want to hurt these

751
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,270
people.

752
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,563
So I want to stay to help them.

753
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,897
This is, like, the first

754
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,190
decision I've made that's, like,

755
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,401
for me, you know, because I

756
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,695
don't want to let anybody down.

757
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,988
I don't want anybody to hate me.

758
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:03,572
I don't want anybody to think

759
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:09,536
that I'm quitting.

760
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,998
>> JEFF: This adventure means

761
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,082
different things to different

762
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,083
people.

763
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,043
It represents different things

764
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,169
to different people.

765
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,295
You've certainly given it your

766
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,296
best.

767
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,630
>> Yeah.

768
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,674
Oh, god.

769
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,633
>> JEFF: And all's going to be

770
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,634
okay.

771
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,595
Ready to get out of here?

772
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,596
>> I am.

773
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,348
>> JEFF: Let's get your stuff.

774
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,195
>> I'm sorry, guys.

775
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,321
>> Don't apologize.

776
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,407
>> I'm sorry.

777
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,035
>> You know, Kathy's been

778
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,078
through a lot, and most of it is

779
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:51,995
she lost most of her motivation.

780
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,871
So what's the point of going

781
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,039
through the suffering?

782
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,040
>> It was nice to get to know

783
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,249
you these last couple of days.

784
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:56,792
>> She just said she's had

785
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,585
enough, and she's quitting.

786
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,587
Which is sad, but still and all,

787
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,838
I mean, it's up to her.

788
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,548
You can't fault her.

789
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,343
You can't be upset with her.

790
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,552
Hope she has a good trip, and

791
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,262
I'm sure I'll see her again.

792
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,640
>> JEFF: So the Airai tribe is

793
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,559
down to six in spite of winning

794
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,896
challenges.

795
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,314
Game continues.

796
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,566
See you soon.

797
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,116
>> Bye.

798
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,743
>> Bye.

799
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,971
>> Kathy leaving, it's sad, but

800
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,222
at the same time, life goes on

801
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,057
here, and there's a reality to

802
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,350
the fact that the sun is going

803
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,476
down, and we haven't had water

804
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,727
in three days, and we haven't

805
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,895
had a cooked meal because we

806
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,021
haven't had fire.

807
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,982
You know, so<i> Survivor</i> continues

808
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,276
for the rest of us.

809
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,583
>> I think you got a dose of who

810
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,128
Oscar really is with the boat

811
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,672
ride yesterday.

812
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,631
And...

813
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,507
>> I'm starting to see that.

814
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,384
>> Mm-hmm.

815
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,343
>> He's kind of arrogant.

816
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,678
>> You think?

817
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,762
>> Kind of bothering me.

818
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,265
>> Hmm.

819
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,725
Amanda got to see how there's a

820
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,310
selfish, arrogant part to Ozzy.

821
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,271
>> It's so sad.

822
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,648
Very sad.

823
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,110
>> And if I got that out of the

824
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,570
trip, then, okay, I can suck it

825
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,488
up, because there was a benefit

826
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,199
to it-- letting her see, you

827
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,575
know, Ozzy is about Ozzy.

828
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,576
>> I don't know.

829
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,453
Like, I've been trying to figure

830
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,078
out if people really think Ozzy

831
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,455
is, like, the best thing in the

832
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,414
world or if they're just

833
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,373
playing.

834
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,500
>> Did you hear Erik?

835
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,542
"Oh, my god, if he wasn't here

836
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,294
we'd die."

837
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,046
It's like, "Shut up, Erik."

838
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,632
How can we vote Erik, though?

839
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,091
How many of us is it?

840
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,760
Because Ozzy is not going to

841
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,428
vote Erik.

842
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,512
He's kind of in love with Erik

843
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:14,763
right now.

844
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,598
They climbed that coconut tree.

845
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,935
And because he just worships the

846
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,811
ground that he walks on, he'll

847
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,355
never get rid of Erik.

848
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,356
>> I think it's the best move to

849
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,357
make.

850
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,274
>> To get rid of Erik?

851
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,735
>> Maybe.

852
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,820
>> Ozzy's not going to do it.

853
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,780
>> We just have to let him think

854
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,990
he's in complete control.

855
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,075
>> Mm-hmm.

856
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:35,909
>> You know what I'm saying?

857
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,994
>> Mm-hmm.

858
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,667
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.

859
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,299
Malakal, getting your first look

860
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,592
at the new Airai tribe.

861
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,928
Kathy has left the game.

862
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,763
>> Kathy?

863
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,598
>> What?

864
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,641
>> JEFF: We'll bring Jason and

865
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,809
Tracy in from Exile.

866
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,602
I'll explain what happened.

867
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,729
>> Well, hello!

868
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,607
>> Hi.

869
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,608
>> Hey.

870
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,776
>> JEFF: Let me kitchen

871
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,069
everybody up on what's going on.

872
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,487
Yesterday, Kathy sent word that

873
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,613
she wanted out of the game.

874
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,824
I went over to Airai's camp.

875
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,992
She said, "I've had enough.

876
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,076
I need to go."

877
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,786
We packed up her belongings.

878
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,870
She quit.

879
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,372
Both tribes at six.

880
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,623
All right, you guys ready to get

881
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,958
to today's immunity challenge?

882
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:25,834
>> Yeah.

883
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,668
>> JEFF: First things first.

884
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,129
Give it up, Eliza.

885
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,343
Once again, immunity is back up

886
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,344
for grabs.

887
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,595
On my go, one member of each

888
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,180
tribe will race across a

889
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,141
floating bridge carrying one end

890
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,684
of a piece of rope.

891
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,436
When you reach the platform,

892
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,937
you'll clip the rope into a

893
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
large puzzle piece, and then

894
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,940
hang on as the rest of the tribe

895
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:49,774
will crank a giant winch,

896
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,444
pulling you and the puzzle piece

897
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,903
back to shore.

898
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,238
Once you've collected all five

899
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,240
puzzle pieces, two tribe members

900
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,700
will unfold those bundles and

901
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,659
use the pieces to solve a puzzle

902
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,163
in the form of a perfect square.

903
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,247
Make sense?

904
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:04,956
>> Yeah.

905
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,707
>> Yeah.

906
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,708
>> JEFF: I'll give you a minute

907
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,751
to strategize, we'll get

908
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,710
started.

909
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,004
Eliza and Ozzy first off.

910
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,547
Here we go, for immunity,

911
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,840
Survivors ready?

912
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,383
Go!

913
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,593
>> Go, baby, go!

914
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,010
>> Come on, Ozzy!

915
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,429
>> You got it Eliza!

916
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,513
>> Go, Eliza!

917
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,183
>> You got it, girl!

918
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,059
>> Come on, Ozzy!

919
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,226
Go, go, go!

920
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,605
>> JEFF: Ozzy first to the

921
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:28,938
puzzle piece.

922
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,442
Eliza right there.

923
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,777
>> Go!

924
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,868
>> JEFF: Airai taking a long

925
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,579
time to get going.

926
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,793
Ozzy's back with the puzzle

927
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,544
piece.

928
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,756
Next person going!

929
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,840
Ozzy's going to go again.

930
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,301
Airai lost a lot of time right

931
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,969
off the bat.

932
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,806
Next person.

933
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:07,394
Jason now for Airai.

934
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,895
>> Come on, Ozzy!

935
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:09,813
>> Come on, Ozzy!

936
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,106
>> JEFF: Ozzy at the second

937
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:11,856
bundle of puzzle pieces.

938
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,609
Ozzy with a big lead for

939
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,944
Malakal.

940
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,779
Jason struggling.

941
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,116
>> Erik!

942
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,200
Go, Erik.

943
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,118
It's you next.

944
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,244
Push.

945
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,370
Come on, push.

946
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,496
>> JEFF: Erik on the course.

947
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,122
Malakal has three bundles left.

948
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,748
>> Go!

949
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,917
>> JEFF: Jason now getting a

950
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,210

Erik struggling on the bridge.

953
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,464
Airai now making up some time.

954
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,927
Erik reaches the platform.

955
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,060
Parvati on the course.

956
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,186
>> Come on, Parv!

957
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,146
You got it, girl!

958
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:51,896
>> JEFF: We are tied, two

959
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,484
bundles each.

960
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,485
>> Yeah!

>> JEFF: Parvati struggling on

962
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,904

963
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,406
>> Good job, Parv!

964
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:01,823
Keep it up, girl!

965
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,907
>> JEFF: Erik back with the

966
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,702
third puzzle piece for Malakal.

967
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,870
Only two puzzle pieces left.

968
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,913
>> You got it, girl.

969
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,956
>> Almost there!

970
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,832
>> JEFF: Ozzy having no trouble

971
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,834
on this bridge.

972
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,252
Parvati reaches the end.

973
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:14,794
She's clipped in.

974
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,213
Parvati now being dragged in.

975
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,048
Ozzy reaches the end of the

976
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,967
platform quickly.

977
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,435
>> There you go!

978
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,603
>> JEFF: Ozzy like he's on a

979
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,355
boogie board.

980
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:34,981
Ozzy's going to go again.

981
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,400
Malakal with their fourth puzzle

982
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,526

984
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,028

Natalie heading out on the

986
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,989
course.

987
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,407
Malakal leads 4-3.

988
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,533
>> You got it, Nat!

989
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,659
>> Come on, Ozzy!

990
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,328

00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,621
fifth and final puzzle piece for

992
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,039
Malakal.

993
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,044
Natalie losing a lot of time for

994
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,003
Airai.

995
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:57,962
Ozzy's coming back with that

996
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,047
fifth and final piece.

997
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,965
Natalie's at the platform and

998
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,050
clipped in.

999
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,010
>> Hold on!

1000
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,221
>> JEFF: Malakal pulling him

1001
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,514
back.

1002
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,431
Ozzy really working it like it's

1003
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,682
a board.

1004
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,476
Malakal has all five pieces.

1005
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,060
Go!

1006
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,354
Two puzzle makers.

1007
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,813
>> Go, go, go!

1008
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,439
>> JEFF: Amanda and Cirie start

1009
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,899

1010
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,983
Malakal.

1011
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,818
Eliza heads out for that fifth

1012
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,153
and final puzzle piece per

1013
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,738

Malakal already working on that

1015
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,367
puzzle with a big lead.

1016
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,327
This puzzle will form a perfect

1017
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:29,953
square.

1018
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,330
>> Go, go, go!

1019
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,665
>> JEFF: Eliza clips in to the

1020
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,375
fifth puzzle piece for Airai.

1021
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,709
The quicker you get started, the

1022
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,419
faster you will finish.

1023
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,047
Eliza back with the final piece!

1024
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,383
Go!

00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,008
Jason and Eliza going to work on

1026
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,010

Amanda and Cirie working on the

1028
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,012
puzzle for Malakal.

1029
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,598
Immunity on the line.

1030
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,849
>> You guys are doing great!

1031
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,226
>> JEFF: These pieces are heavy,

1032
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,602
going to be hard to move.

1033
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,312
Jason and Eliza still untying.

1034
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,188
>> It's okay, guys, get them

1035
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,398
untied.

1036
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,357
>> We've got them untied.

1037
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,608
We just need to get them out.

1038
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,527
Help me get them out.

1039
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,695
>> JEFF: Malakal with a big lead

1040
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,696
already starting to work on this

1041
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,822
puzzle.

1042
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,574
Eliza and Jason have all five of

1043
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,908
their pieces untied.

1044
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,076
They're starting to work on

1045
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,661
forming the puzzle.

1046
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,829
>> Use that one.

1047
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,705
>> This one?

1048
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,622
>> Right here, yeah.

1049
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,206
Push that one over, Amanda!

1050
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,834
>> JEFF: Amanda and Cirie now

1051
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,794
starting to struggle a bit.

1052
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:20,920
Jason and Eliza have a different

1053
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,423
strategy, spreading all the piss

1054
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,008
out, looking for patterns.

1055
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,092
>> Help her pull this one!

1056
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,093
Help her pull this one!

1057
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,011
>> JEFF: Cirie and Amanda really

1058
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,179
slowing down.

1059
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,472
Eliza and Jason starting to make

1060
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,807
a little progress.

1061
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,891
>> This one at the bottom?

1062
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,726
>> Yeah, yeah.

1063
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,518
Flip it around.

1064
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,311
There you go.

1065
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,020
There you go.

1066
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,478
>> Turn it, turn it!

1067
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,148
Right here, right here.

1068
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,149
>> That one might be the center.

1069
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,400
>> JEFF: Cirie and Amanda taking

1070
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,777
their time.

1071
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,613
>> That one right there, that

1072
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,780
one right there.

1073
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,616
Right in the middle.

1074
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,241
>> JEFF: Eliza and Jason trying

1075
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,785
to shove one last piece in.

1076
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,828
Will it fit?

1077
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,080
Is it right?

1078
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,875
Airai wins immunity!

1079
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,088
Airai, congratulations.

1080
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:09,344
Immunity is yours once again.

1081
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,762
For the third straight time,

1082
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,055
Airai wins immunity, safe from

1083
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,473
tribal council.

1084
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,974
Malakal, tribal council tonight,

1085
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,601
where one of you is going home.

1086
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,644
Grab your stuff.

1087
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,562
See you there.

1088
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,190
Airai, head out.

1089
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,400
Nice job.

1090
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,129
>> Hey, Oz, I'm so sorry about

1091
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,131
the puzzle.

1092
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,132
I feel like crap about it.

1093
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,550
>> Yeah.

1094
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:54,138
It was so easy.

1095
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,733
>> So then who do we choose?

1096
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,776
>> I think it just makes more

1097
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,069
sense if Tracy...

1098
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,153
>> Ozzy is wanting Erik to stay

1099
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,406
because he's got a good

1100
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,449
relationship going with Erik,

1101
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,493
but I just feel like I can work

1102
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,953
more with Tracy.

1103
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,578
She's more into the game, and

1104
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,872
being third or fourth among

1105
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,374
Cirie, Ozzy, and Amanda is

1106
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,625
something that's definitely

1107
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,835
always on my mind.

1108
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,419
Could I betray him if it comes

1109
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,254
down to that?

1110
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,672
Sometimes you have to pull the

1111
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,799
dirty cards to stay in the game.

1112
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:30,591
Let me tell you what's

1113
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,467
happening.

1114
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,635
The girls want to get rid of

1115
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,720
Erik.

1116
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,346
Ozzy wants to get rid of you.

1117
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,556
It was his idea to send you to

1118
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,515
Exile.

1119
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,516
>> I know.

1120
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,477
>> And so if we can get Ozzy to

1121
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,438
vote for you and us three girls

1122
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,650
to vote for, Erik, then you, me,

1123
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,152
and Erik can vote for Ozzy and

1124
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,695
get Ozzy out of here.

1125
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,780
>> The plan that Tracy and I

1126
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,116
talked about is talk Amanda and

1127
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,784
Cirie into voting for Erik,

1128
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,368
which they want to do anyway.

1129
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,119
Tell them that I'll vote with

1130
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,996
them.

1131
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:00,997
Go for that.

1132
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,622
We all three say we're voting

1133
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,374
for Erik.

1134
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,667
Ozzy doesn't know, and doesn't

1135
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,835
want to vote for Erik, so he'll

1136
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,461
vote for Tracy, thinking we're

1137
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,588
all going to vote for Tracy.

1138
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,131
Well, underneath all of that,

1139
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,967
Tracy, Erik, and I are going to

1140
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,677
vote for Ozzy, and just take

1141
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,888
Ozzy out at the knees.

1142
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,608
>> Mm-hmm.

1143
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,358
You're next after me.

1144
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,735
If you think you are.

1145
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,695
>> In order to pull off voting

1146
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,321
out Ozzy at this point, we have

1147
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,615
to either pull in Cirie and

1148
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,783
Amanda.

1149
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,408
If this doesn't work out, I have

1150
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,117
to vote Tracy.

1151
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,703
If I voted Ozzy with Tracy, they

1152
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,329
would flip out, and I would be

1153
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,791
so done, whatever came next.

1154
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,213
>> Well, I know Ozzy wants me.

1155
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,925
But I'd like to stay.

1156
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,051
And you got to think right now

1157
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:55,551
what you're going to do.

1158
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,302
Would you rather go up against

1159
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,220
me or would you rather go up

1160
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,971
against Ozzy?

1161
00:34:59,055 --> 00:34:59,722
Would you rather go up against

1162
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,556
Erik or would you rather go up

1163
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,432
against me?

1164
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,647
As long as you two say that

1165
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,318
that's good.

1166
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,948
>> So you feel like Erik, right,

1167
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,491
because of...

1168
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,326
>> Well, yeah.

1169
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,327
Are you?

1170
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,203
Do you think that's the best

1171
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,412
decision?

1172
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,789
>> I'm just nervous about what

1173
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,373
Ozzy might have planned on the

1174
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,291
other side with Erik and those

1175
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,043
girls.

1176
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:30,086
>> If I was definitely set on

1177
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:30,711
wanting Erik out tonight, he'd

1178
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,255
be gone tonight.

1179
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,756
I guarantee you.

1180
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,382
But I don't know at this point

1181
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,342
if I will be able to turn on

1182
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,552
Ozzy or not.

1183
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,344
If I go against Ozzy, then I can

1184
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,721
pretty much kiss that

1185
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,098
relationship good-bye.

1186
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,349
I mean, there are so many people

1187
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,684
that you have to vote out.

1188
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,268
You're going to hurt someone's

1189
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,020
feelings in this game.

1190
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,022
It's inevitable.

1191
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:56,279
>> Don't look at me!

1192
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,948
>> If Cirie and Amanda don't

1193
00:35:59,031 --> 00:35:59,574
vote with me, there's a whole

1194
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,534
other path that could be taken.

1195
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,244
I'm kind of going both ways in

1196
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,912
my head still.

1197
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,330
Am I going to take Ozzy out, or

1198
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,623
am I going to stick with these

1199
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,499
people that I've known from the

1200
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,750
beginning and vote out one of

1201
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,835
the fans?

1202
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:11,460
Tonight's decision is a very big

1203
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,462
decision.

1204
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,547
It could change the game in a

1205
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,924
serious way.

1206
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,984
>> JEFF: Let's get straight to

1207
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:35,735
it.

1208
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,611
This tribe is obviously in

1209
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,612
trouble.

1210
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,863
You've lost three straight

1211
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,072
immunity challenges.

1212
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,073
The only reason you're even

1213
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,491
halfway in it is because of odd

1214
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,326
circumstances-- Penner having to

1215
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,495
be medically pulled out of the

1216
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,747
game, and Kathy deciding to

1217
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,414
quit.

1218
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,373
Tracy, who is leading this

1219
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,459
tribe?

1220
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,585
>> Ozzy.

1221
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,462
Ozzy is leading this tribe.

1222
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,838
I mean, Ozzy was the first one

1223
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,923
that looked at me and said, "You

1224
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,007
need to go to Exile Island for

1225
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,425
the tribe."

1226
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,384
Ozzy tells us who is going to

1227
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,428
compete, when you're going to

1228
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,012
eat, and what you're going to

1229
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,513
eat.

1230
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,473
>> JEFF: Ozzy, you had a big

1231
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,474
reaction when Tracy said you're

1232
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,475
the leader.

1233
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,351
>> Oh, yeah, just... it's

1234
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,560
ridiculous.

1235
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,603
If I'm the leader of this tribe,

1236
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,896
I haven't known about it.

1237
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,105
I do what needs to get done at

1238
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,523
certain times, but I really

1239
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,358
don't feel like I'm the leader

1240
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,443
of the tribe.

1241
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,945
And I definitely don't feel like

1242
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,488
I'm deciding who eats what when.

1243
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,280
That doesn't make any sense, and

1244
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:25,368
doesn't jibe with me at all.

1245
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,119
>> JEFF: Cirie, somebody's got

1246
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,412
to be leading the tribe to one

1247
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,872
degree or another.

1248
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,165
>> In a way I kind of see where

1249
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,166
Tracy's coming from.

1250
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,501
I'm not saying that Ozzy is the

1251
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,045
leader of the tribe, but just

1252
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,671
about 90% of everything that we

1253
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,881
do, everyone checks with Ozzy

1254
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,758
first.

1255
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,426
>> JEFF: Erik, do you see what

1256
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,844
everybody's talking about, the

1257
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,054
dynamics right now?

1258
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,555
>> There's a conflict going on.

1259
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,473
There's a conflict in this

1260
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,184
tribe.

1261
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:50,810
And, I mean, I understand Ozzy's

1262
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,104
point.

1263
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,897
Nobody wants to be the leader,

1264
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,440
but things need to get done.

1265
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,150
Things need to happen, and he's

1266
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,151
doing so much for this tribe.

1267
00:37:59,235 --> 00:37:59,944
If he was gone, we would fall

1268
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:00,820
apart faster than we are right

1269
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,571
now.

1270
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,990
>> JEFF: Ami, there are two

1271
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:04,615
different approaches this tribe

1272
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,450
could take right now-- short-

1273
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,202
term thinking, which is, "We

1274
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,620
need to win challenges."

1275
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,414
Long-term thinking is, "I need

1276
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,832
to start getting rid of people

1277
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,457
who could beat me in this game."

1278
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,459
Take me down that line.

1279
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,378
>> Well, you always have to be

1280
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,130
looking out for, "Which one of

1281
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,715
these people is going to be the

1282
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,424
biggest threat to me, and when's

1283
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,467
the best time to get rid of

1284
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,468
them?"

1285
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,262
And you've got to play your

1286
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,096
cards when it makes the most

1287
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:27,972
sense.

1288
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,806
>> JEFF: Ozzy, when you hear Ami

1289
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,307
talking about getting rid of the

1290
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,684
people more threatening, make

1291
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,103
you a little concerned?

1292
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,980
>> Oh, yeah, it does.

1293
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:36,605
I'm not that naive to think that

1294
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,315
people don't want me gone even

1295
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:38,774
if they need me to win

1296
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,943
challenges.

1297
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:41,986
I'm still going to give it my

1298
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,320
all, and I'm still going to be

1299
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,488
loyal to the people that I've

1300
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,574
said I'm going to be loyal to.

1301
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,992
Nothing's going to change that.

1302
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:48,576
So if I'm a threat and people

1303
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,537
want to get rid of me, you know,

1304
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,872
that's one strategy.

1305
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,081
But the other strategy is they

1306
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,166
can be with me and we can try

1307
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,126
and go to the end together.

1308
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,711
>> JEFF: Tracy, why keep you

1309
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,546
tonight?

1310
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,672
>> I think I'd be a better tribe

1311
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,466
member than somebody's that's

1312
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,009
going to demolish you if you do

1313
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,677
go to the merge.

1314
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,678
And I think that's that needs to

1315
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,637
be a thought that all these

1316
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,930
people need to think about.

1317
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,015
I would be less of a threat than

1318
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,099
Ozzy to Ami, to Amanda, to

1319
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,267
Cirie, than Ozzy.

1320
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:13,809
It's just as simple as that.

1321
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:18,439
It's black and white.

1322
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,607
There's no gray.

1323
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,900
>> JEFF: All right, let's get to

1324
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:21,984
it.

1325
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,069
It is time to vote.

1326
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,154
Amanda, you're up.

1327
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,501
>> You said you were honest, and

1328
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,545
that's bull.

1329
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:53,766
>> This is because you wanted me

1330
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,558
out.

1331
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:54,850
Good player.

1332
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,685
No hard feelings.

1333
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,245
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1334
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,621
votes.

1335
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,506
If anybody has the hidden

1336
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,465
immunity idol and you want to

1337
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,091
play it, now wouldn't time to do

1338
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,759
so.

1339
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:35,850
Okay.

1340
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,767
Once the votes are read, the

1341
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,726
decision is final.

1342
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,727
The person voted out will be

1343
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,520
asked to leave the tribal

1344
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,020
council area immediately.

1345
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,772
I'll read the votes.

1346
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,694
First vote, Tracy.

1347
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,781
Ozzy.

1348
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,950
One vote Tracy, one vote Ozzy.

1349
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,832
Tracy.

1350
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,917
Two votes Tracy, one vote Ozzy.

1351
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,423
Tracy.

1352
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,382
That's three votes Tracy, one

1353
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,509
vote Ozzy.

1354
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,306
Seventh person voted out of

1355
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:15,764
<i>Survivor: Fans Versus</i>

1356
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,725
<i>Favorites,</i> Tracy.

1357
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,602
That's four, that's enough.

1358
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,104
You need to bring me your torch.

1359
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,033
Tracy, the tribe has spoken.

1360
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,745
Time for you to go.

1361
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,172
Well, tonight's vote was big for

1362
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,215
one simple reason-- you've got

1363
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,758
to start winning some

1364
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,634
challenges.

1365
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,218
Hopefully you made the right

1366
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:52,551
choice.

1367
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,511
Grab your torches.

1368
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,429
Head back to camp.

1369
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,348
Good night.

from our next episode.

>> JEFF: Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1379
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:22,039
Ami and Cirie go on the warpath.

1380
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,540
On Airai, Parvati makes new

1381
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:23,791
friends.

1382
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,583
>> You and Alexis, me and

1383
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,336
Amanda, final four.

1384
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,837
>> JEFF: And the injuries

1385
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:29,713
continue to pile up.

1386
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,549
Erik takes a hard hit.

1387
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,510
He's out!

1388
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,058
>> Going up against the

1389
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,518
favorites was quite difficult.

1390
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,102
Ozzy's a wonderful player in

1391
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,645
this game.

1392
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,147
He is manipulative and he is

1393
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,274
strategic.

1394
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:48,899
He will definitely take the rest

1395
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,651
of the tribe down.

1396
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,902
They need to get rid of him ASAP

1397
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:52,987
or else they don't stand a

1398
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,946
chance.

1399
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:54,780
I wish I could have stayed in

1400
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:54,989
longer.

1401
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,824
I went out kicking.

1402
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,658
I did everything I could, and

1403
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,910
I'm just grateful to be here.
