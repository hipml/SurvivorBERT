00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:05,755
>> Erinn's with us.

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,090
She just feels like none of them

5
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,383
care about her, so why should

6
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,426
she care about them?

7
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,510
>> PROBST: The Jalapao Three

8
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,136
pulled in Erinn and took control

9
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,097
of the game, but Coach still

10
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,058
wanted to call the shots.

11
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,268
>> Okay.

12
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,185
>> PROBST: However, not everyone

13
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,439
was on board.

14
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,481
>> Hmm-mm.

15
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,566
>> PROBST: Despite Taj and

16
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,859
Erinn's rogue votes...

17
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,277
>> I couldn't vote for Sierra.

18
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,404
>> PROBST: ...Coach got his way.

19
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,240
Sierra, the tribe has spoken.

20
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,908
Six are left.

21
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,077
Who will be voted out tonight?

22
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,585
>> Well, final six, guys.

23
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,712
Congratulations.

24
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,713
>> That's not a small

25
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,255
accomplishment.

26
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,507
>> I am so tired.

27
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,926
>> I'm glad the drama's gone.

28
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,303
>> Amen.

29
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,138
I just hope we can get some

30
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,890
sleep tonight.

31
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,183
>> Erinn and Taj took the

32
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,726
cowardly way out and voted for

33
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:00,727
two people who didn't deserve

34
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,853
to be voted for: Stephen and

35
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,437
Debbie.

36
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,271
It was preposterous.

37
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,564
Erinn and Taj need to be cut

38
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,690
off at the kneecaps.

39
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,108
I'm pissed at them for writing

40
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,485
your name down and for writing

41
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,986
Stephen's name down tonight.

42
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,154
That was ridiculous.

43
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,489
>> You've got to let it go.

44
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,157
>> This is the time for the

45
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,658
warrior alliance.

46
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,243
There's a reason why we have a

47
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:17,452
name.

48
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,579
People that don't play this game

49
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,247
even half as honestly as me,

50
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,167
even half as bold as me, like we

51
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,796
saw tonight, pisses me off.

52
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,464
I have two words for you.

53
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,298
Taj and Erinn.

54
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:30,924
You know what?

55
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:31,800
We're going to run them through

56
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,051
with a sword the next two votes.

57
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,511
And I'm thinking Taj has to go

58
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:34,677
next.

59
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,304
>> You got to let it go or it's

60
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:36,805
going to drive you nuts.

61
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,056
>> What a bunch of freaking

62
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:38,807
cowards.

63
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,432
I'm so pissed at them.

64
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,141
>> All right, I'm going to go

65
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:40,683
back in there 'cause I don't

66
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,851
want them to think we're out

67
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,227
here.

68
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,061
All right, I'll see you

69
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,436
tomorrow.

70
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,020
>> I just wanted to tell you

71
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:44,646
that I was backing you up on the

72
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,313
fact that they were cowardly

73
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:49,567
lions.

74
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,278
>> Coach does not let things go.

75
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,363
without a complete, utter

76
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,909
dialogue as to why.

77
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,370
It gets so old.

78
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,704
He called me over to talk.

79
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,705
He's really upset.

80
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,333
I said, "I know, but it's over."

81
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,419
You know?

82
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,757
>> I don't care about the

83
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,843
million dollars.

84
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,177
I care about my integrity and

85
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,096
honesty and changing this game

86
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,389
from start to finish, and I've

87
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,431
said that from day one, and

88
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,933
that will never change.

together since day one, but

94
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:48,334
lately, it's been not a positive

95
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,212
thing for me.

96
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,297

As a social person in a social

99

100
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,010
be attached to Coach.

101
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:57,635
He's a downer.

102
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,219
People are tired of comments

103
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,264
and directives and not doing a

104
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,515
whole lot around camp, really

105
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,643
hadn't been for a while.

106
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,353
So, I laid in bed last night,

107
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,229
and it came to me and I thought,

108
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,065
you know what?

109
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,358
I got to step up.

110
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:22,410
Hey.

111
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,953
>> Sounds fishy.

112
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,455
>> Things are coming out that I

113
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,040
didn't sign up for, and I think

114
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,333
that you guys probably feel the

115
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,043
same.

116
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:30,585
You know what I'm saying?

117
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,837
We're going to have to talk.

118
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,463
>> I love him.

119
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,756
>> I love him, too, but we'll

120
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,423
have to...

121
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,424
>> Yeah.

122
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,385
>> Debbie is playing a very

123
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,595
strategical game, and she's

124
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,181
scared right now, and, uh,

125
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,390
Debbie may be more of a loose

126
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,267
cannon than I thought.

127
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,311
Debbie may be up to some no good

128
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,063
around here.

129
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,398
I'm so sick of Debbie.

130
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,358
>> I'm starting to really

131
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:53,650
dislike her.

132
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,818
(imitating Debbie): J.T., you

133
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,444
gonna saw this with me?

134
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,196
You think it's going to rain

135
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,113
today?

136
00:03:59,197 --> 00:03:59,739
>> (imitating Debbie): I think

137
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,907
it's clearing up.

138
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,616
>> J.T...

139
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,450
>> I guess you're talking about

140
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:02,617
me.

141
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,619
What's going on, guys?

142
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,411
Hey, I don't know what you all

143
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,872
have been talking about, but I

144
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,499
don't want Coach speaking for

145
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:09,666
me.

146
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,919
Now, I will tell you this, and I

147
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,296
don't like going against Coach,

148
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,341
but as far as I'm concerned,

149
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,052
I'm on a tribe with you two and

150
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:21,928
I'm in an alliance with you two,

151
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,638
and I give you my honest

152
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,847
to God, pinky swear word on

153
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,724
that, God strike me dead.

(thunder rumbles)

155
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,729
I am in it with you two.

156
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,398
>> All right, good, okay.

157
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,399
>> Good, good.

158
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,066
>> Good, all right.

159
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:35,525
>> I love you, Debbie.

160
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,150
>> And then we're going to go

161
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,236
party in Biloxi.

162
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:38,861
I love you.

163
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,279
I'm so glad you're in my life.

164
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,197
>> I know.

165
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,907
>> Debbie is a very strategic

166
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,867
player, and I think people don't

167
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,244
give her enough credit because

168
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,495
she is sweet and because she is

169
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,329
chattery, but she has definitely

170
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,373
got a lot going on underneath

171
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,333
that persona, and she worries me

172
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,086
a little bit.

173
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:09,475

This phone does a lot.

297
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,651
One thing it can do right now

298
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,279

Only one person can buy this

00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,749
and win this.

307
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,459
But for this item, you can pool

308
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,752
money, meaning if somebody

309
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,212
wants to give you their money,

310
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,505
they can.

311
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,798

game that can be rather nasty

322
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,689
at times?

323
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,649
>> Taj has had a tougher time

324
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,566

00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,486
Debbie has kids, but Taj left a

326
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,905
little baby at home.

327
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:51,948
>> PROBST: Taj, you're not even

328
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,573
going to have to bid against

00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,074

333
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,705

You need it.

335
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:01,916
>> PROBST: All right, Taj, let

336
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,543
me officially put it up for bid.

337
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,586
The Sprint loved one message

bucks, your card?

343
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,014
>> Everything.

344
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:17,723
>> PROBST: You don't need to

345
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,015

Get that so you can see it.

350
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,276
>> Hey, babe.

351
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,070
Wait for number one, two, and

three, and four.

353
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,990
No, I'm just kidding.

354
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:34,824
We're all here wanting to say

355
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,575
hello to you.

356
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,660
We miss you so much.

357
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,996
As you can see, the house is

358
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,789
not the same without you.

359
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,958
We are sending you out

360
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,126

anything going on here, no,

365
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:50,965
we've got it locked down.

366
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,175
So you just put all your focus

367
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,761
and attention on your task at

368
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,220
hand.

369
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,930
We're holding it down here at

370
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,932
the George household.

371
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,686
See you back at the camp.

372
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,147

375
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,030
Oh, my God.

376

>> I did.

379
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,242

380
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,618
there, might have been a little

381
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,329
hard to hear.

382
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:21,996
There's one...

383
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,456
>> See you back at the camp!

384
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,751
Oh, my God!

385
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,960
>> Oh, my God.

386
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,462
>> What?!

387
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,464
>> PROBST: Just dawned on her.

388
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,965
>> Oh, my God!

389
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,759
Thank you so much!

390
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,846
Thank you!

391
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,056
>> That's wonderful.

392
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,098
>> Oh, my God!

393
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:41,766
>> Oh, my God!

394
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,850
Can we go now?

395
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,769
>> PROBST: Taj, come on back up

396
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:44,977
here.

397
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,771
I'll tell you how it's going to

398
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,855
work.

399
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,357
So the last thing Eddie said on

400
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,025
this tape was, "I'll see you

401
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,860
back at camp."

402
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,236
Which means just what you

403
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,696
think it does.

404
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,948
The bad news is he's the only

405
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,742
loved one that's coming back to

406
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,786
camp, but everyone can have a

407
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,788
loved one back at camp if

408
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,288
you're willing to make a

409
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,956
sacrifice.

410
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,459
If instead of taking Eddie back

411
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,710
to camp, you will instead send

412
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,172
yourself to Exile Island, where

413
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,757
Eddie will come with you...

414
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,592
>> Oh! Oh!

415
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,551
>> PROBST: Then everybody else

416
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,677
gets a loved one back at camp.

417
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,428
>> I'll do it!

418
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,596
I'll do it!

419
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,889
>> Yeah, baby!

420
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,016
>> I'll do it.

421
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,398
>> Okay, can we go now?

422
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,440
>> A romantic night in the

423
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,024
dunes.

424
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:32,733
Are you crazy?

425
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,776
>> Exactly.

426
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,276
>> PROBST: Here's a map.

427
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,195
Not that you need it.

428
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,321
>> Where do I go?

429
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:37,988
>> PROBST: Right up this way.

430
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:38,322
>> Bye, guys.

431
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,573
Have fun.

432
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,199
>> Have fun, Taj.

433
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:40,825
>> Thank you, Taj!

434
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,743
>> PROBST: Taj will return back

435
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,994
into the game in time for the

436
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:44,870
next immunity challenge.

437
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,872
I know you guys are ready to

438
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,748
get back to camp.

439
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,666
Grab your stuff.

440
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,291
Get out of here.

441
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,167
Have a good afternoon.

442
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,378
>> Thanks, Jeff!

443
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,441
(screaming)

444
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:18,112
(laughing)

445
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,532
>> Oh, missing you, babe!

446
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,825
Missing you!

447
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,952
>> Oh, baby!

448
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,709
>> Golly, you look bad.

449
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,002
(laughing)

450
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,962
>> I do. Look at that.

451
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,296
>> Oh, my God.

452
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:35,963
>> I've been wearing this dress

453
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,798
for a month.

454
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,175
My husband jumps out from

455
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:39,800
behind a tree and he just

456
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,927
looked like an angel.

457
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,638
He just looked like a big old

458
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,264
muscle-bound... I just wanted to

459
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,015
take him to the side to have a

460
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,892
conjugal visit.

461
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,477
>> Oh, my God.

462
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,186
>> Look at my back.

463
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,978
Look at me legs.

464
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:51,812
They've been killing me.

465
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,938
I'm like the bugs' favorite

466
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,064
treat out here.

467
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,691
>> Golly, you've lost so much

468
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,692
weight!

469
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,985
>> I don't eat.

470
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,613
>> She looks great.

471
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,197
I mean, she looks... she looks

472
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,990
happy, you know.

473
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,241
She doesn't look withered or

474
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,993
worn down.

475
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,119
She's dirty now.

476
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,954
She smells filthy, you know, but

477
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,289
there's something about the

478
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,707
wild, you know, that make you

479
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,792
sexy, you know.

480
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,376
It's kind of a turn-on, you

481
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,128
know?

482
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,297
This is all right.

483
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,932
>> Funky D, what's up?!

484
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,310
>> Oh, my God.

485
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,770
There's my daughter.

486
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,896
There's my baby.

487
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,065
>> Oh, my God, I am so happy to

488
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,359
see you!

489
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,027
>> Awesome!

490
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,321
>> Oh!

491
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,076
>> Oh, my God!

492
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,161
I don't want you to have to see.

493
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,664
>> I was crying.

494
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,791
>> Like my home?

495
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,919
>> I am so gross.

496
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,419
You're going to need to

497
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,296
disinfect yourself.

498
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,257
>> As soon as I saw my brother

499
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,925
standing there with his hand

500
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,259
over his mouth.

501
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,552
>> Oh, my God!

502
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,553
>> It was just like shock at

503
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:05,928
seeing me.

504
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,930
>> Oh, my God!

505
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,098
>> I just, like, gave him a big

506
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,141
hug.

507
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,643
I mean it was maybe one of the

508
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,019
like most just biggest,

509
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,563
sincerest, like, warmest hug

510
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,939
we've ever shared, like, if

511
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,107
not the most.

512
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,233
>> What do you think of this

513
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:19,984
place?

514
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:20,985
Can you believe I've lived here

515
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,361
31 days?

516
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,905
>> I cannot say. It's...

517
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,198
No.

518
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,408
>> Pretty river, isn't it?

519
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,076
>> Yeah.

520
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,787
>> When I saw Adrianna, she was

521
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:31,996
crying.

522
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,997
It was real huge.

523
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,915
I mean, it was like, I didn't

524
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:35,332
care about nothing.

525
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,792
I just had to get with my

526
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,543
little sister, you know.

527
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,002
Put it on.

528
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:38,419
I want to see it.

529
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,628
>> All right.

530
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,130
>> That looks nice on you.

531
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:41,547
>> You look great.

532
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,673
You look healthy.

533
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,007
You look thin.

534
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,842
>> Don't eat me!

535
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,761
>> I sleep right here.

536
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,846
Those are my pants.

537
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,390
Here's my stuff.

538
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,142
My dad was proud of me just for

539
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,436
coming out here.

540
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,353
>> Now you know that's all you

541
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:56,562
need.

542
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,855
>> Yeah.

543
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,064
He was like, "Wait a minute.

544
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,150
You're doing this.

545
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:01,942
What the hell?"

546
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,986
Like, I'm always dressed up.

547
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,404
I'm always super girly and,

548
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,072
like, I think for him to see me

549
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,407
outside of that was a

550
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,742
little bit shocking to him.

551
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,618
>> Hey, man, guess what they

552
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,869
call me in this game?

553
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,746
Dragonslayer because I'm

554
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,246
slaying all the dragons.

555
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,123
I'm running this freaking show,

556
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,708
let me tell you that right now.

557
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,292
I think I'll be in the final

558
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,293
two.

559
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:19,627
>> I hope so.

560
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,252
>> Unless something crazy comes

561
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,087
up.

562
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,214
If you were to say you could

563
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,215
have filet mignon or you can see

564
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,133
your assistant coach for ten

565
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,384
minutes, I would say I want to

566
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,511
see my assistant coach.

567
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,057
(back cracking)

568
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,892
Ah.

569
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,603
Yeah, that's what I'm talking

570
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,520
about.

571
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,648
Get this, too.

572
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,070
Yeah, no, push, forward, more.

573
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,989
We are not doing weird sexual

574
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,115
positions, by the way.

575
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,284
It's just I haven't had my back

576
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,411
cracked.

577
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,373
>> What is that?

578
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,957
>> Corongutoba.

579
00:15:59,041 --> 00:15:59,541
You can make tortillas out of

580
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,793
it.

581
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,418
>> You can?

582
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,004
Mm-hmm. Here, try it.

583
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,214
>> Suck on the pit for a while.

584
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,715
Don't break your teeth.

585
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,508
>> Smells like dirty feet, kind

586
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,176
of.

587
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,344
>> That's my favorite snack

588
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,012
we got.

589
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,681
>> You don't have to finish it.

590
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,140
I know.

591
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,100
I know.

592
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,017
We love it.

593
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,144
>> Mm.

594
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,357
>> And another thing you have

595
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,775
to be careful of out here is

596
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,693
like the scorpions and stuff

597
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,069
like to hide under the branches

598
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,362
so you be careful where you

599
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,530
grab it.

600
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,489
>> Scorpions, huh?

601
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,407
>> Yeah.

602
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,658
>> Underneath where?

603
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,617
>> They're more afraid of you

604
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,201
than you of them.

605
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,370
>> I don't want to find out.

606
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,996
You know what, I played ball.

607
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,123
I played against great Steeler

608
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,417
defenses; I played against

609
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,293
great players like Ray Lewis,

610
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,296
but, oh, snakes, scorpions,

611
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,382
spiders... I'm like, "What?!

612
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,008
You live with... these are your

613
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,135
friends now?"

614
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,181
>> Look at you!

615
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,641
That's my man!

616
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,684
Okay.

617
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,810
Let's get some on there.

618
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:00,978
Keep it going.

619
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:01,562
>> I have a newfound respect

620
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,690
for her doing this for 31 days,

621
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,234
and not any help and standing

622
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,277
strong.

623
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,903
I know plenty of women that

624
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,280
wouldn't even think about

625
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,781
coming out here and enduring

626
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,907
this.

627
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,409
So, you know, she gets all of

628
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,869
my love for this one.

629
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,244
She's the best.

630
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,246
>> I'll be home soon.

631
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,206
>> This is your half...

632
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,124
not halftime.

633
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,085
This is the fourth-quarter prep.

634
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,253
>> Seeing my husband just,

635
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,964
just... it really helped me.

636
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,923
He is my fire.

637
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,800
He is the love of my life.

638
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,635
So it was just like the skies

639
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,179
just parted; the sun came out.

640
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,889
I just... and nothing else hurt

641
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,016
after that.

642
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,687
>> You're doing great, man.

643
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,230
You're doing amazingly.

644
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,565
>> It's okay.

645
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,566
>> Huh?

646
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,859
>> I just hate breaking down.

647
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:49,318
>> Why?

648
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,319
>> You know, it's like you're

649
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,653
not... you don't think about

650
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,237
these things, but when I'm out

651
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,740
here I don't think about that...

652
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,116
I try not to think about the

653
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,660
people I'm missing at home.

654
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,622
>> They're good.

655
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,581
She told me to tell you that she

656
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,791
loves you.

657
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,666
And wants to know when you're

658
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,167
getting back.

659
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,251
>> I never thought I'd miss you

660
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,421
and Mom and Jamie so much.

661
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,339
>> Wishing you could be with

662
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,381
the cows.

663
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,509
>> I know, me, too.

664
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,054
>> And I'm so glad I did it

665
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,847
because it's changed...

666
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,849
it's changed me to be a better

667
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,433
person, to not take things for

668
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,061
granted.

669
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,563
Look at my hands.

670
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,815
>> It's okay.

671
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,357
That will all fix.

672
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,485
That will all fix.

673
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,153
>> Today has been the most

674
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,404
emotional day for my husband

675
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,823
and I.

676
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,950
It just showed how really

677
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,076
intense our love is for each

678
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,410
other.

679
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,120
It meant the world to me that

680
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:42,704
my husband came out here to

681
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,750
support me.

682
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,293
I didn't want him to go, though.

683
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,170
>> Very cool thing, like, I've

684
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,422
definitely changed a lot.

685
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,216
I'm a total badass.

686
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,425
That's all I have to say about

687
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,635
that.

688
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,761
Now when I go home, like,

689
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,763
there's somebody that I don't

690
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,598
have to explain this to.

691
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,307
And to have somebody here that

692
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,309
you can just tell everything

693
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,769
to, and know that he wouldn't

694
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,689
use anything against you.

695
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,731
Somebody who loves you no

696
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,482
matter what.

697
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,400
Somebody's who's worried about

698
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,317
you, somebody who's concerned

699
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,027
about you, was a really great

700
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:14,278
thing.

701
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,488
Out here you kind of forget

702
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,073
what that feels like, and it's

703
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,408
really nice.

704
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,367
>> It's good to meet you, Dave.

705
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,160
>> Good to meet you, J.T.,

706
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,078
and good luck to you.

707
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:23,954
>> Absolutely.

708
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,539
>> Hey.

709
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,498
You've got a good woman.

710
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,499
She cares a lot about you.

711
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:27,749
>> Thanks.

712
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,334
>> She does.

713
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,544
I mean that.

714
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,420
>> I'm so glad everybody was

715
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,297
here.

716
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,840
>> I don't want you all to go.

717
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,049
>> I know, I know.

718
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,302
>> Okay, bye.

719
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,178
>> Good to meet you, Coach.

720
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:40,679
>> You, too.

721
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,221
>> Good luck to you.

722
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:41,555
>> Thank you.

723
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,056
>> Please don't tell Mom how

724
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,517
skinny I am.

725
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,353
Oh, I had a tough time saying

726
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,023
good-bye.

727
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,107
It was really, really hard

728
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,192
to let go of him.

729
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,526
All I can see is my dad, and I

730
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,569
just want to be there, and I

731
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,904
want to hang out with him,

732
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,739
and it was awesome.

733
00:19:58,822 --> 00:19:59,281
>> I love you.

734
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,991
>> I love you, too.

735
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,492
>> Oh!

736
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,995
I can't wait to come home.

737
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,496
>> I'm so proud of you.

738
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,623
>> Thank you.

739
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,540
>> You're the best, you know

740
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:08,749
that?

741
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,000
>> Yes.

742
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,086
(laughter)

743
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,129
>> I love you.

744
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:15,297
>> I love you more.

745
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,465
I won't smell like this for

746
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,425
long.

747
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,259
>> I know.

748
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,427
That's okay.

749
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,179
I love you.

750
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,014
>> I love you!

751
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,767
>> Don't let the bedbugs bite!

752
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,394
>> Too late!

753
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,322
>> Cool today.

754
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,823
>> Uh-huh.

755
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,325
>> Kind of cool this morning.

756
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,160
>> Yeah, it is.

757
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:46,495
Day 32.

758
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,539
Can't believe that.

759
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,583
>> So when he's on a walk

760
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,292
today, let's try to figure out

761
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,795
how we can get out because I

762
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,462
came up with some other ideas,

763
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,047
too.

764
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,673
>> Okay.

765
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,382
>> Things we need to think of

766
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,299
down the line.

767
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,384
>> Right, okay.

768
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,386
Debbie's opened up like white

769
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,471
on rice in the past few days.

770
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,807
And that leads me to believe

771
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,725
that she's turning her game face

772
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,768
on.

773
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,852
She's throwing Coach under the

774
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,020
bus right now, and they've been

775
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,106
tight since day one.

776
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:15,857
You gotta watch out for people

777
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,943
like that.

778
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,152
>> ...Good to always be

779
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,362
talking strategy and stuff.

780
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:20,612
>> Yeah.

781
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,865
>> Um, I really think Taj needs

782
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,076
to go.

783
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,370
I have this gut feeling, I keep

784
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,579
thinking that if she plays the

785
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,873
immunity idol, then one of us

786
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,333
could go home.

787
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:33,834
You see what I'm saying?

788
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,627
I'm not trying to get paranoid,

789
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,920
but I just don't want any wild

790
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:37,504
cards sneaking up on us, you

791
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,381
know what I'm saying?

792
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,383
Does that sound like a plan?

793
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,176
>> That sounds like a plan.

794
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,802
>> All right, I'm not trying to

795
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,013
push, uh, Taj down your throat.

796
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:46,930
I want you to feel comfortable

797
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:47,639
about that.

798
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,473
>> No, I understand completely.

799
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,057
>> I just have a feeling about

800
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,142
it, man.

801
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:50,976
>> Yeah, we'll do that.

802
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,185
We'll talk with Stephen today.

803
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:52,728
We can't let Taj in our ear

804
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,688
anymore.

805
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,440
>> Uh-uh.

806
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,025
>> I'm going to go get some more

807
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,902
wood.

808
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,195
>> Coach's strategy's not the

809
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,196
same as mine at this point in

810
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,989
the game.

811
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,490
I feel like I'm really like a

812
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,992
few steps ahead of Coach

813
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,076
when it comes to strategy.

814
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,618
I tell him what he wants to

815
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,787
hear at this point to make it

816
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,247
look like I'm on the same page

817
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,582
he's on, when in turn, you know,

818
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,916
we're not really on the same

819
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,252
page right now.

820
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,136
>> I just feel like, you know,

821
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,138
exactly, like I said...

822
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,264
>> Okay, wait.

823
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,057
Do you agree, Erinn?

824
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,475
>> Yeah.

825
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,976
Yeah, I agree.

826
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,227
>> Um, he definitely don't do

827
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,688
nothing around camp.

828
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,981
>> And also, I think I'm just

829
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,483
ready to see him go.

830
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,276
>> Yeah.

831
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,069
>> It's going to have to be

832
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,028
like we did, like y'all did with

833
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:43,737
Tyson.

834
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,738
It's got to be a blindside.

835
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,447
>> Right.

836
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,323
>> Sure.

837
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,074
>> But it has to be every

838
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:47,949
single one of us writing it

839
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,658
down.

840
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,951
>> Yeah.

841
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,453
>> He's going to be furious

842
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,996
or devastated more.

843
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,331
But he's going to feel mostly

844
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,041
betrayed by me.

845
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,834
Talk is, and this is going to

846
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,002
break his heart and he's going

847
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,170
to feel like I have definitely

848
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,755
betrayed him, but the talk is

849
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,048
for Coach to be the next one to

850
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,174
go.

851
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,300
So, he's going to think we're

852
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,384
voting off Taj.

853
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,219
>> Yep.

854
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:07,969
>> That's who Coach will think

855
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,637
we're voting for.

856
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:08,929
>> Exactly.

857
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,222
>> Okay.

858
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,014
>> He's pretty much driving

859
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,224
everybody crazy in the camp

860
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:12,766
right now, including me at

861
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,558
times.

862
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,936
Coach thinks he's in an

863
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:16,561
alliance with myself, J.T., and

864
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,562
Stephen.

865
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,564
But J.T. and Stephen have had it

866
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,734
as well.

867
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,902
>> At least in the next vote,

868
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,028
we gotta be secure in what we

869
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:25,737
do.

870
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,863
>> Okay, I think we need to go

871
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,948
ahead and kick Coach out 'cause

872
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,075
he's driving everybody insane.

873
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,747
Honestly, you are two of the

874
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,040
people that I care most about

875
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,834
in this whole thing and I will

876
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,252
do anything in my power for you

877
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,294
two to be sitting there at the

878
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,420
very end.

879
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,296
I swear to you.

880
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,966
I swear to God I will.

881
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,593
And honestly, I'll even do this

882
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,803
for y'all.

883
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,013
If I have the immunity idol,

884
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,224
and it's down to us three,

885
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,892
I will give it to one of you

886
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,602
so I can be voted out.

887
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:57,853
>> Wow.

888
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,479
>> And I mean that.

889
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,564
I'm happy with third.

890
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,482
Swear to God.

891
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,610
I would hand it to you, J.T.

892
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,736
>> That's awesome, Debbie.

893
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,405
You're an incredible person.

894
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,447
>> I would do it.

895
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,700
I swear to you, I'd do it.

896
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,618
>> You cannot really trust

897
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,746
anybody's promises out here.

898
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,081
I don't know Debbie that well.

899
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:18,665
I've known her for ten days.

900
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,625
I don't know her personal

901
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,460
relationship with God or what

902
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,712
her swears to God mean, but,

903
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,755
you know, it's a very lucrative

904
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,923
offer.

905
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,675
A lock for sure on the final

906
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:33,138
two.

907
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:33,722
>> She just told Stephen and

908
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,639
myself that she would do

909
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,766
anything to see me and him

910
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,559
in the final two.

911
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,895
Those were her exact words.

912
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,605
>> Okay, she's out.

913
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,147
>> With Debbie making that

914
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,733
promise to Stephen and myself,

915
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,109
it also makes me wonder what

916
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,444
other promises she's made to

917
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,237
other people, uh, because she

918
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,572
shows she's willing to do

919
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,615
whatever it takes to move

920
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,283
forward in this game, even if

921
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,492
she says she only wants third

922
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,243
place.

923
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,286
Nobody wants third place in this

924
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,120
game.

925
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,205
>> Did she tell Taj the same

926
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,372
thing?

927
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,458
>> Yep, yep.

928
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,667
She goes.

929
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:17,557
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

930
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,559
We'll now bring in Taj

931
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,603
returning from Exile Island.

932
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,980
>> Come on, Taj!

933
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,107
>> Hey!

934
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,863
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

935
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,198
to today's challenge?

936
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:33,949
>> Yeah.

937
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:34,866
>> PROBST: First things first,

938
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,993
Coach.

939
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,082
Once again, immunity is back up

940
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,000
for grabs.

941
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,085
For today's challenge, you're

942
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,169
going to make your way through

943
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:46,753
a series of obstacles.

944
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,256
You'll dig your way under a log.

945
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,298
You'll go across a balance

946
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,592
beam, then under a rope crawl

947
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,677
and out into a field where you

948
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,179
will find ten spinning math

949
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,764
symbols.

950
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,182
You'll memorize the sequence of

951
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,392
symbols, then race back to your

952
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,851
answer board and write them

953
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,020
down in the same sequence to

954
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,064
solve a math equation.

955
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,315
First person to get all the

956
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,942
symbols right and the correct

957
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,069
answer to the equation wins

958
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,029
immunity and is guaranteed a

959
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:13,822
one-in-...

960
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,782
>> ALL: Five.

961
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,743
>> PROBST: Five shot at winning

962
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,037
the million bucks.

963
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,080
>> Wow.

964
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,081
>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots.

965
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,625
We'll get started.

966
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,505
Here we go, for immunity.

967
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,715
Survivors ready?

968
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,842
Go!

969
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,432
First stage is dig a big hole.

970
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,184
So you can crawl under.

971
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:43,768
Lost a lot of weight out here,

972
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,854
but you still want to make sure

973
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,730
you can get your butt through

974
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,814
that hole.

975
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,941
J.T. gonna give it a shot.

976
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,449
J.T. is stuck.

977
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,284
J.T. is halfway through.

978
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,620
Taj giving it a shot.

979
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,540
Taj is stuck.

980
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,667
J.T. is through!

981
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,340
J.T. moving through to the

982
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,759
crawl-through.

983
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,595
J.T. having a big lead right

984
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,721
now.

985
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,847
Memorize as many of those

986
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,974
symbols as you can in one shot.

987
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,480
Debbie's through the

988
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,274
crawl-through.

989
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,150
(mumbling)

990
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,903
Plus, plus.

991
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,738
>> PROBST: Stephen gonna have to

992
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,114
dig a lot more to squeeze

993
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,451
through.

994
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,827
J.T. across the beam.

995
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,411
Gotta get back through that

996
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,746
hole now before he can start

997
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,790
working on the answer.

998
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,041
Coach is now through.

999
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,002
He's heading out.

1000
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,545
J.T. starting to work on his

1001
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,964
answer.

1002
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,925
Taj is through now.

1003
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,637
Stephen squeaks through.

1004
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:06,810
Stephen falls off.

1005
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,770
J.T. heading out to try and

1006
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,773
remember some more symbols.

1007
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,858
Stephen falls off again.

1008
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,572
Debbie back.

1009
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,782
J.T.'s across again.

1010
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,201
Stephen cannot get across the

1011
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:23,910
balance beam.

1012
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,828
He's quickly falling out of

1013
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:30,208
this challenge.

1014
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,209
Taj taking a look at the

1015
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,544
symbols.

1016
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,837
J.T. racing back.

1017
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,172
Coach heading back.

1018
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,133
Erinn is finally through!

1019
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,384
Stephen finally across the

1020
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,429
balance beam, but way behind.

1021
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,265
Debbie heading back.

1022
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,850
J.T. back from his second trip,

1023
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,893
filling in the last of the

1024
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,187
symbols.

1025
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,647
J.T. working on the math portion

1026
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,607
of this.

1027
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,025
The symbols have to be right in

1028
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,486
order for the math to be right.

1029
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,163
Coach back with his first set

1030
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,123
of symbols.

1031
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,166
Stephen heading back after

1032
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:15,879
being out there a long time.

1033
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:16,921
Debbie back from her second

1034
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,716
trip.

1035
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,509
Taj back from her first trip.

1036
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,594
Coach going to head out looking

1037
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,722
for more symbols.

1038
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,432
Debbie working on the math.

1039
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,602
J.T. doing the math.

1040
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,227
Stephen back with his first set

1041
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,146
of symbols.

1042
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,857
He was out there a long time.

1043
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,984
How many can his brain hold?

1044
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,658
Taj heading back out.

1045
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,201
With only one look at the

1046
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,161
symbols, Stephen's doing all of

1047
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,914
this on one pass.

1048
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:55,001
Is he right?

1049
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,837
>> So, two minus...

1050
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,922
>> PROBST: It's J.T. and Stephen

1051
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,049
neck and neck.

1052
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,311
>> Jeff, is that right?

1053
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,229
>> PROBST: Stephen thinks he has

1054
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,230
it.

1055
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:15,980
>> I got it.

1056
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,606
>> PROBST: If he did it, he did

1057
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,024
it with only one look at the

1058
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,151
symbols.

1059
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,363
Stephen is right!

1060
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,156
Stephen wins immunity!

1061
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,032
>> Oh, my God!

1062
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,450
I won immunity!

1063
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,452
I can't even believe it!

1064
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,579
(cheering)

1065
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,125
>> PROBST: Stephen, I gotta ask

1066
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,126
you.

1067
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:37,877
You memorized all ten symbols in

1068
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,380
one pass.

1069
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:40,922
>> Well, I divided... I made

1070
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,591
each symbol be a number so I had

1071
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,677
plus is one, divided by is

1072
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,886
four, times is three.

1073
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,887
And I know the brain can

1074
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,013
remember a seven-digit number

1075
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,390
'cause that's why phone numbers

1076
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,599
are seven digits.

1077
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,141
So, I divided it into two

1078
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,186
numbers, um, and just remembered

1079
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,563
those two numbers.

1080
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,438
>> PROBST: Well, it worked.

1081
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,523
Come on over.

1082
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,691
>> All right, Stephen!

1083
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,275
>> PROBST: That was one of the

1084
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:00,900
biggest come-from-behind

1085
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,653
victories ever.

1086
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,737
>> I was pretty much last.

1087
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,780
>> PROBST: With this around his

1088
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:06,281
neck, Stephen is safe at

1089
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,283
tonight's Tribal Council.

1090
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,828
J.T., Debbie, Coach, Taj, Erinn,

1091
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,706
after 33 days out here, one of

1092
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,206
you going home tonight.

1093
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,874
Grab your stuff.

1094
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,667
Head back to camp.

1095
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,710
I will see you at Tribal.

1096
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,419
Nice work.

1097
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,212
>> Thanks a lot, Jeff.

1098
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,338
>> I look over at Stephen and I

1099
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,172
see the necklace around his

1100
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,465
neck, and it was just like I got

1101
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,383
the necklace.

1102
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,093
You know, every time something

1103
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,762
goes our way, I try hard not to

1104
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,305
do it, but I always look at

1105
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,223
Stephen and smile because he

1106
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,641
knows just like I do we just

1107
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,100
keep battling it out.

1108
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,059
Keep doing what we're doing.

1109
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,186
We can do this.

1110
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:51,993
>> Good job, Steve-o!

1111
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,203
>> Thank you.

1112
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:54,495
>> Steve-o.

1113
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,289
Steve-o!

1114
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,081
>> The day I did not think would

1115
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,583
come.

1116
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,542
>> I'm going to go and rinse

1117
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,585
off.

1118
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,085
>> Me, too.

1119
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:01,836
>> Yeah.

1120
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,629
>> Let me get some of this sand

1121
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,422
off.

1122
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,965
J.T. and I, we came into this

1123
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,593
merge basically expecting to be

1124
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,135
picked off.

1125
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,136
And now we're in the dominant

1126
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,929
position.

1127
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:12,889
Now the Timbira people are

1128
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,514
individually coming to us and,

1129
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,309
you know, begging for our mercy.

1130
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,144
So to have done that together

1131
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:18,978
with Taj and J.T., to have

1132
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,231
stuck tight, even when all of

1133
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,232
these different factions were

1134
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,485
vying for our attentions,

1135
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,696
we feel pretty good about it.

1136
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,448
>> Debbie thinks Coach...

1137
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,199
>> Debbie is strategical woman

1138
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:31,824
of the year.

1139
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,659
>> Oh, my God.

1140
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,202
She's sucking up to everybody.

1141
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,453
>> She promised us if we'd take

1142
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,954
her to the final three, she

1143
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,665
would give up immunity and take

1144
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,207
third place.

1145
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:39,499
>> Get out.

1146
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,792
>> Which we don't believe.

1147
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,584
>> In the same day, she said

1148
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,960
we've got to get rid of Erinn.

1149
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:43,836
>> Get out.

1150
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,838
>> So, I said, "Erinn, when

1151
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,381
you got nauseous at the end,

1152
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,132
Debbie just threw you under the

1153
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:48,633
bus."

1154
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,134
She said, "Coach, then you, and

1155
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,010
then Taj, of course, next."

1156
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,388
>> Oh, Lord.

1157
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,889
He's like, "Are you okay out

1158
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:55,139
here?"

1159
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,182
I was like, "I have two brothers

1160
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,476
that are taking care of me."

1161
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,103
>> Taj really trusts Stephen

1162
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:00,728
and myself.

1163
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,479
I mean, we're her only two

1164
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,355
guys out here.

1165
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,273
It's good to know, you know,

1166
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,316
that she's still sticking with

1167
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,235
us, but no one else in this

1168
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,861
entire tribe knows what's really

1169
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,989
going on like Stephen and I do.

1170
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,411
>> Huh?

1171
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,078
The more you think about it?

1172
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:17,620
>> The Debbie thing is not a

1173
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,038
good idea.

1174
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,416
What do you think?

1175
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,834
The downsides of losing Debbie

1176
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,293
are she is a really hard worker

1177
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:24,585
around camp.

1178
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,337
She is a very strong positive

1179
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:26,587
presence.

1180
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,381
I actually think she would step

1181
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,383
aside at three and let J.T. and

1182
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,217
me have it.

1183
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,885
>> Man, that spa was so nice

1184
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,386
right now.

1185
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,721
>> We went at the wrong time.

1186
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,346
We went when it was overcast and

1187
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,472
gross.

1188
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,307
>> Yeah.

1189
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,726
>> You feeling good?

1190
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,269
>> I'm feeling good now.

1191
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,563
>> My ass.

1192
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:47,024
(laughing)

1193
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,443
>> Other downsides to losing

1194
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,235
Debbie are a couple more days

1195
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,111
here with Coach.

1196
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,196
>> I think about it, and I've

1197
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,614
got my instincts saying you've

1198
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,741
got to get rid of Taj next

1199
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,950
because if she has the idol,

1200
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:58,369
she's going to play the five.

1201
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,579
>> We're solid, man, the four

1202
00:33:59,662 --> 00:33:59,787
of us.

1203
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,955
We don't have nothing to worry

1204
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:01,456
about.

1205
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,623
The only thing to get in our

1206
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,332
way is the idol.

1207
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,418
We play this right, that's over

1208
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,586
with.

1209
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,296
That's done.

1210
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,297
Coach, you know, he's always

1211
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,675
wanting to reassure that things

1212
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,677
are going his way, and it's

1213
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,636
just hard to deal with him.

1214
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,429
I mean, I don't want to lie to

1215
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,390
him.

1216
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,768
>> All the way, fellas.

1217
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,602
>> Let's do it.

1218
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,144
>> Do you guys realize...

1219
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:23,770
I'm just going to tell you this

1220
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,937
right now.

1221
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,105
I'm just going to throw a

1222
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,774
reality check on you.

1223
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:28,399
One of us three is going to win

1224
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,442
it.

1225
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,651
>> I hate lying to anybody, so

1226
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,779
anybody I got to lie to, I try

1227
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:33,446
to avoid them.

1228
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,572
So the sooner I get the people

1229
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,364
I've got to lie to out of the

1230
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,909
game, the better.

1231
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:11,859
>> Whether or not Debbie is

1232
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,443
scheming, whether or not Coach

1233
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,695
is delusional, right now it

1234
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,321
doesn't matter.

1235
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,697
We need to figure each move

1236
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,741
strategically to make things

1237
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,283
easier for the next move.

1238
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,577
We don't need any of them to be

1239
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,995
loyal right now; as long as we

1240
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,247
have a strong alliance, we can

1241
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,374
pick them off one by one.

1242
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,556
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1243
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,350
the members of our jury.

1244
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:48,187
Brendan, Tyson, and Sierra,

1245
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,565
voted out at the last Tribal

1246
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,401
Council.

1247
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,487
Coach, from the beginning of

1248
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,822
this game, you've talked about

1249
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,532
going to the end with the best

1250
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,241
players.

1251
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:00,950
>> Right.

1252
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,576
>> PROBST: With only six people

1253
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,828
left, everybody can't be

1254
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,538
equally deserving.

1255
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,706
>> I think that, you know, what

1256
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,833
might be considered a strength

1257
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,167
in my mind might not be a

1258
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,043
strength in somebody else's

1259
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:11,544
mind.

1260
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,254
Stephen, you know, he's a

1261
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,881
warrior to me because he has

1262
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,674
gone from a boy who likes to

1263
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,718
read books about adventure to a

1264
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,427
man who is living an adventure

1265
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,971
and excelling at it without any

1266
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:22,847
complaints.

1267
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,598
>> PROBST: Let's go a little

1268
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,348
further with this.

1269
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,558
How about Debbie?

1270
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,976
Why should she be here at the

1271
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,185
end and not someone else

1272
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,061
sitting up here?

1273
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:29,604
>> I'd say that Debbie is

1274
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,564
playing the game for the same

1275
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,107
reasons that I am, and that is

1276
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,066
for integrity.

1277
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,693
And so that's why we paired up

1278
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,486
on day three because I know she

1279
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,738
will never lie to me,

1280
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,238
no matter what.

1281
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,616
>> PROBST: And because you feel

1282
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,909
that way, that makes her the

1283
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:43,367
best to go to the end.

1284
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,703
>> I trust her implicitly.

1285
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,287
She will not lie to me in this

1286
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,497
game.

1287
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,582
>> PROBST: Taj, how risky is

1288
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,126
that for Coach to say, "I

1289
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:52,668
paired up with Debbie on day

1290
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,003
three?"

1291
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,338
>> Um, it's not risky.

1292
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:55,796
That's what people do.

1293
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,756
You build alliances.

1294
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,090
You do what you have to do to

1295
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:58,674
survive in the game, and he's

1296
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,134
done a great job.

1297
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:00,968
He's a warrior.

1298
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:01,427
He's a dragonslayer.

1299
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,012
He-He's...

1300
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:03,930
>> PROBST: A warrior.

1301
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:04,805
>> That's what he says.

1302
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,515
He's a warrior...

1303
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,642
>> PROBST: That's what you said.

1304
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,601
>> Because that's what he calls

1305
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:08,809
himself.

1306
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,478
>> I didn't come up with that,

1307
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:10,770
by the way.

1308
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,146
>> PROBST: Let me guess: some

1309
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,856
chief in a small village...

1310
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,274
(laughter)

1311
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,401
>> That's fine.

1312
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,028
Hey, every time we come in here

1313
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,696
and you want to try to cut me

1314
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,365
down because you want to try to

1315
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,117
ferret out the truth, I love it.

1316
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,327
>> PROBST: Okay.

1317
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,745
Let's take it to the next step.

1318
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,871
Tell me about Taj.

1319
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,790
What is it that makes her best

1320
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,749
to go to the end?

1321
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,960
>> When I saw the raw emotions

1322
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,420
of her the other day at the

1323
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,381
auction, you know, she has made

1324
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,466
the ultimate sacrifice, taking

1325
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:43,135
time away from her son that

1326
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:43,594
she'll never get back.

1327
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,389
And so, that is incredible.

1328
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:46,931
>> PROBST: Coach, how hard

1329
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,766
would it be to vote out Taj

1330
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,392
tonight after making that

1331
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,519
sacrifice so that you guys

1332
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,520
could all get your loved ones?

1333
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,354
>> I think every time that each

1334
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,815
one of us sit here and analyze

1335
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:56,524
each person up here, we all

1336
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,318
think, "Is it justifiable?"

1337
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,820
And obviously, coming on the

1338
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,946
heels of her doing something

1339
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,364
like that, it would be very

1340
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,865
difficult for any of us to

1341
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,826
want to vote her out tonight.

1342
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:07,868
>> PROBST: Now, let's turn the

1343
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,452
tables.

1344
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,453
J.T., what makes Coach worthy?

1345
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,622
He talks about wanting to take

1346
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,456
the best to the end.

1347
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,040
What if he's not one of the

1348
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:13,416
best?

1349
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,376
>> Anyone that will stand here

1350
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,169
and put himself out on the line

1351
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,504
and be this honest, you know,

1352
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,506
has never told a lie, deserves

1353
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,133
to go as far as his body can

1354
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,259
stand.

1355
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,552
>> Debbie, what is working

1356
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,511
against Coach making it to the

1357
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,304
end?

1358
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:27,888
>> I think Coach is determined

1359
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,556
to be honest.

1360
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,892
And this is a game that honesty

1361
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,937
is huge, but can it really last

1362
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,522
through the duration of this

1363
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,231
game?

1364
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:37,773
I don't know.

1365
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,357
But if there is an Achilles'

1366
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,526
heel on Coach, that could be it.

1367
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,445
>> PROBST: Erinn, is tonight's

1368
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,530
vote going to surprise somebody?

1369
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,616
>> Um, there might be surprises

1370
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,951
tonight.

1371
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:49,910
>> PROBST: Debbie, how will

1372
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:54,040
tonight's vote change this game?

1373
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,791
>> Um, that's a really good

1374
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,584
question, Jeff.

1375
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,502
I think that it's going to

1376
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,503
change the way this tribe

1377
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,131
behaves and how we're going to

1378
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,382
figure out who belongs where,

1379
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,386
and, um, I do think it will be a

1380
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,513
surprise.

1381
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,598
>> PROBST: Stephen, you have

1382
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,557
the individual immunity

1383
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,059
necklace.

1384
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:13,684
As always, it's yours to assign

1385
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,560
to somebody else if you want

1386
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,145
or keep it for yourself.

1387
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:16,896
>> I'm going to hold on to it,

1388
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:17,104
Jeff.

1389
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,064
>> PROBST: You cannot vote

1390
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:18,522
for Stephen.

1391
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,232
Everybody else is fair game.

1392
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:20,858
It's time to vote.

1393
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,985
Coach, you're up.

1394
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,453
>> Taj, you're a beautiful soul.

1395
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,580
Best of luck.

1396
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,730
>> I'm sorry, Coach, but this

1397
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,315
game is changing, and you wanted

1398
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:02,608
to play it with honesty and

1399
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,276
integrity, and it's time for you

1400
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,985
to go.

1401
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,113
Hope you forgive me.

1402
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,251
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1403
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,379
votes.

1404
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,595
If anybody has the hidden

1405
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,638
immunity idol and you want to

1406
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,390
play it, now would be the time

1407
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:38,185
to do so.

1408
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,354
Okay, once the votes are read,

1409
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:41,438
the decision is final.

1410
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,356
The person voted out will be

1411
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,149
asked to leave the Tribal

1412
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,525
Council area immediately.

1413
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:48,195
I'll read the votes.

1414
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,448
First vote: Taj.

1415
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:55,995
Coach.

1416
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,122
One vote Taj; one vote Coach.

1417
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,252
Debbie.

1418
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,795
One vote Taj; one vote Coach;

1419
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,922
one vote Debbie.

1420
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:11,635
Debbie.

1421
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,720
That's two votes Debbie;

1422
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,015
one vote Taj; one vote Coach.

1423
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,685
11th person voted out and the

1424
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,728
fourth member of our jury:

1425
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,646
Debbie.

1426
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,148
That's three.

1427
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:24,690
That's enough.

1428
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,650
You need to bring me your torch.

1429
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,616
Debbie, the tribe has spoken.

1430
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,705
Time for you to go.

1431
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,799
Well, there's no doubt the best

1432
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,177
players will make it to the end.

1433
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,761
The more interesting question:

1434
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,430
of the five of you, who's the

1435
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,265
best of the best?

1436
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,058
Grab your torches.

1437
00:41:59,141 --> 00:41:59,767
Head back to camp.

1438
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,643
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i>

1449
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,540
>> Erinn can't really control

1450
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,375
what she says.

1451
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:24,959

with her new alliance.

1453
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,461

1454
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:28,337
like, so tasteless.

1455
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,505
>> I would hate for anything

1456
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,089
that I said to send me home

1457
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,799
before Coach.

1458
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,968
>> Dragonslayer makes the

1459
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,010
dragon cane.

1460
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,178
>> PROBST: And Coach digs deep

1461
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,346
to stay in the game.

1462
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,430
>> Hit me with your best shot,

1463
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:38,889
Pat Benatar.

1464

(yelling)

1465
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,480
>> I'm really the girly-girl,

1466
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:47,606
and eating live fish and

1467
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,567
sleeping in the freezing cold,

1468
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,111
and just everything that I've

1469
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:52,653
endured-- I am so proud of

1470
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,113
myself.

1471
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:54,697
And I know that it was a hard

1472
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,657
decision for them to make to

1473
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,700
vote me off tonight.

1474
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,034
I don't hold any grudges.

1475
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,786
This is a game and you got to

1476
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,787
play it the best.

1477
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,289
I'm anxious to sit on the jury

1478
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,541
and see what goes down.
