4
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,921
here.

>> PROBST: ...at Raro...

6
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,339
>> We have to get it together

7
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,132
today.

8
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:07,632
>> PROBST: ...Jonathan's

9
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,426
direction turns some people off.

10
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,593
>> Don't be coming around

11
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,886
barking orders at me in the

12
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,762
morning.

13
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,888
It's like "Shut up, fool."

14
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,098
>> PROBST: Drop your buffs.

15
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,683
You are merging.

16
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,893
Raro and Aitu became one.

17
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:19,769
>> Thank you, sir.

18
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,562
>> PROBST: There is a large

19
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,396
native catamaran filled with

20
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,522
food.

21
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,066
(<i> laughter</i> )

22
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,359
Though the merged tribe

23
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,487
celebrated, the outnumbered Aitu

24
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,364
four felt vulnerable.

25
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:31,948
>> Our backs are against the

26
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:32,824
wall.

27
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,284
We need someone to flip.

28
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,201
So I think I know what would

29
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:35,577
change the game.

30
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,786
>> PROBST: Yul formulated a

00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,371
>> I have the idol.

33
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:38,997
>> PROBST: ...to use the hidden

34
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,123
immunity idol as leverage.

00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,250
>> I think I can use it to get

36
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,168
Jonathan.

37
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:43,793
If it works out, it could change

38
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,294
the course of the game.

39
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,962
Hypothetically, say I have the

40
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:46,588
idol...

41
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,756
>> I'd have to think long and

42
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,923
hard about my reaction if you

43
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:49,966
even implied that you could show

44
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,052
me the idol.

45
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:53,970
>> PROBST: At the first

46
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,138
individual immunity challenge...

47
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,432
We are down to the final two.

48
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,475
...Candice and Ozzy battled it

49
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,726
out.

50
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:00,185
But in the end...

51
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,311
Candice drops out.

52
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,022
Ozzy wins the first individual

53
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,190
immunity.

54
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,232
You are safe in tonight's vote.

55
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,108
After the challenge...

56
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,319
>> This is the idol.

57
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,154
>> PROBST: ...Yul tried to seal

58
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,822
the deal with Jonathan...

59
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,490
>> I appreciate you showing that

60
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,449
to me.

61
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,533
Basically, Yul said, "Vote with

62
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,576
us, or you're going home

63
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,827
tonight."

64
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,495
>> PROBST: ...while Candice and

65
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,329
Adam were playing their own

66
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,414
game.

67
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,207
With tribal council looming...

68
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,000
>> Please understand I have to

69
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:24,834
think about this.

70
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,752
>> PROBST: ...Jonathan was the

71
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,086
swing vote that would make all

72
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,462
the difference.

73
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,005
>> Either way, people are going

74
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,339
to be pissed.

75
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,007
Either I'll have betrayed the

76
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,591
Raro people and I'm a complete

77
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,343
bastard, or I didn't jump over

78
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,595
to the Aitu people and I'm a

79
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,846
complete bastard.

80
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,056
>> PROBST: But at tribal

81
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,349
council, when it came time for

82
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,059
his decision...

83
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,685
12th person voted out and the

84
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,479
fourth member of our jury...

85
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,105
...Jonathan betrayed his former

86
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,982
Raro tribe and joined the Aitu

87
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,859
four in voting out Nate.

88
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,319
Nate, the tribe has spoken.

89
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,404
Eight are left.

90
00:01:53,488 --> 00:02:09,546
Who will be voted out tonight?

91
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,839
>> All I can tell you is this.

92
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,756
You ready?

93
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,423
If it wasn't going to be me

94
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,675
tonight, it was going to be you.

95
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,509
>> He was going to play the idol

96
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:20,014
tonight.

97
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,099
You know?

98
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:21,891
I was not going to play that

99
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,101
game, because the next time, the

100
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:23,726
four of them are gunning for me,

101
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,019
and I'm in a tie-breaker

102
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:25,353
situation.

103
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,313
So I either had a 100% chance of

104
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,898
going home tonight or a 50%

105
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,899
change of going home the next

106
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,316
time.

107
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,235
Because I wanted to swing the

108
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,654
vote, flip the game, I vote for

109
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,698
Nate.

110
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,907
And the truth is that I would

111
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,950
rather play with the Aitu

112
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,451
people; I'd rather see them win,

113
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,661
if I don't win.

114
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,579
I was in the position to make

115
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,746
that choice, and I did, and I

116
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,124
believe I made the right choice.

117
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,302
>> So at tribal council, I think

118
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,012
everyone was holding their

119
00:02:59,095 --> 00:02:59,762
breath.

120
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,431
I believed Jonathan, and I

121
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,265
believed he was sincere in

122
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:02,807
switching over, but I wasn't

123
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,518
sure.

124
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,026
>> It was a huge risk that we

125
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,611
took.

126
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,653
But this is how I wanted to play

127
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,571
the idol.

128
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,572
I wanted to play it at a point

129
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,323
in time where it, you know,

130
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,324
resets the entire game in your

131
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:25,038
favor, and it worked.

132
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:25,622
>> You pissed everyone in this

133
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:30,960
game off, so I hope you're happy

134
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,546
with second place.

135
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,007
I just think that you played

136
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,926
yourself out tonight, and I am

137
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,638
so disappointed.

138
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,348
It's vile to me.

139
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,433
It makes me... I feel sick to my

140
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,809
stomach.

141
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,102
After tribal, I just felt like

142
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,105
that nausea, and I... really,

143
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,357
all I wanted to do was take

144
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,150
Jonathan's face and just throw

145
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,109
up all over it.

146
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,027
You weren't going home tonight.

147
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,694
>> I could have been going home

148
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,362
tonight.

149
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,404
>> No, you couldn't have.

150
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:58,988
>> If I didn't throw in with

151
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,948
them, they all would have vote

152
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,449
for me.

153
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:01,991
You all would have voted for

154
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,368
Yul, and it would have bounced

155
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,161
off Yul and hit me.

156
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:05,870
>> Not if you told us about the

157
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,704
idol.

158
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,997
>> Yul doesn't have the idol.

159
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,249
>> Yul does have the idol.

160
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,459
He showed me the idol.

161
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,001
I don't know what you think

162
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,506
you're talking about.

163
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,508
And even my saying that, you

164
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,008
wouldn't trust that I was

165
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:19,842
telling the truth.

166
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,385
>> I don't.

167
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,010
I absolutely don't trust a word

168
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:21,886
that comes out of your mouth.

169
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,263
>> Fair enough.

170
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,269
>> I couldn't control myself.

171
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,186
I snapped on him and told him

172
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,104
how I felt about him and called

173
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,939
him out.

174
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,399
And I think that he's a filthy,

175
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,485
miserable rat.

00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,093
Candice eats it.

194
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,302
>> She's a lazy, selfish girl,

195
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,804
and a million dollars to her

196
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,597
would not help her in her life.

197
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,431
It would screw her life up.

198
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,809
She's been here 27 days, and she

199
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,143
never gutted a fish, never even

200
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,478
saw how to gut a fish?

201
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,104
>> I was teaching her how to gut

202
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:36,729
a fish.

203
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,313
>> You didn't see me showing

204
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:37,647
her?

205
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,024
>> And she's was like, "Ew."

206
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,026
>> This game is not as fun in

207
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,736
this position.

208
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,905
>> I know.

209
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,120
>> Gross.

210
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,789
He makes me want to throw up.

211
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,624
>> It's a social game.

212
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,667
I love playing with you guys.

213
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,669
I love hanging out with you.

214
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,337
We all worked well, together.

215
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,963
Do you know what I mean?

216
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:02,922
We had it down.

217
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:03,881
I come over here, and I see that

218
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,591
I'm in the clown house.

219
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,358
>> PROBST: Come on in.

Bidding is in increments of $20.

226
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,957
Borrowing money is okay.

227
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,792
Sharing food is not.

228
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,668
>> Oh.

229
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,544
>> PROBST: Auction will end

230
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,628
without warning.

231
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,504
Ready to get started?

232
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,216

Emotionally, I'm on the edge.

571
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,360
>> "When were we rolled in a

572
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,903
barrel?

573
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,947
We merged how many days ago?

574
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,616
All these key moments remembered

575
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,452
now become crucial to know.

576
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,620
Your past will affect your

577
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,246
future.

578
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,999
Stay calm, but you better hurry.

579
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,168
Take too long or things don't

580
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,336
add up, you might be the next on

581
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,672
the jury."

582
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,714
>> This challenge is very

583
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,216
important for me personally.

584
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:54,716
I don't like what Jonathan

585
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,051
stands for.

586
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:56,969
I don't like having Jonathan

587
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:57,261
around.

588
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,180
He's just a dirty, dirty rat,

589
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,224
and I would love to get some

590
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,561
revenge against Jonathan and

591
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,063
continue to be in this game.

592
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:13,193
So I need to win this one.

593
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,280
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

594
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,456
Now bring in Candice, returning

595
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,458
from Exile Island.

596
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,302
Shall we get to today's

597
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,261
challenge?

598
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,137
>> Sure.

599
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,762
>> PROBST: First things first.

600
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,055
Ozzy, why don't you take that

601
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:48,145
off?

602
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,104
Once again, immunity is back up

603
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:51,315
for grabs.

604
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,649
For today's challenge, you will

605
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,818
be quizzed on how well you

606
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,612
recollect the events of the last

607
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,113
30 days.

608
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,239
On my go, you will read four

609
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,866
questions.

610
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,950
This will give you answers in

611
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,535
the form of numbers.

612
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,453
You will then add, subtract, or

613
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,246
divide the answers to come up

614
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,999
with a final number.

615
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,958
You'll then untie a

616
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,835
corresponding box, searching for

617
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,253
a key.

618
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,588
You'll use that key to open a

619
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,299
lock, which will raise a flag.

620
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,968
The first three to raise their

621
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,554
flag move on to the final round.

622
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,181
The winner of that round wins

623
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,642
immunity, guaranteed a one-in-

624
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,353
seven shot at a million bucks.

625
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,438
Losers, tribal council, somebody

626
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,689
going home.

627
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,607
Big enough stakes?

628
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,608
>> Yeah.

629
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,317
>> PROBST: All right, take your

630
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,901
spots on the start, we'll get

631
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,571
going.

632
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,405
Here we go.

633
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,406
First three move on to the final

634
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,575
round.

635
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,410
Survivors ready?

636
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,538
Go.

637
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,290
First question, the total number

638
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,375
of pieces used to construct the

639
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,919
stepping stones for the fifth

640
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,088
immunity challenge used to

641
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,714
transport tribe members from one

642
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,299
platform to the next.

643
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,177
Take that number and add it with

644
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,345
the number of plaster boxes to

645
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,722
be smashed by each tribe with

646
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,724
a club to retrieve keys in the

647
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,809
challenge to win the catalog

648
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,644
reward.

649
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,937
Take those two numbers, subtract

650
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,230
the number of days since the

651
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,440
Aitutaki Tribe mutiny, including

652
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,401
today, and subtract the number

653
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,362
of people currently in the jury,

654
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,447
and you have your number.

655
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,032
How well do you recall what has

656
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,658
happened out here over the last

657
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:28,328
month?

658
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,538
Jonathan untying, thinks he has

659
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,372
it.

660
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,331
Ozzy untying.

661
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:31,915
Yul now untying, thinks he has

662
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,626
it.

663
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:41,925
If you find a piece of metal

664
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,467
that is not a key, you are

665
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,304
wrong.

666
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:46,930
Jonathan was wrong, has to start

667
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,307
again.

668
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,768
Is Ozzy right?

669
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,520
No.

670
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,105
It's been a long 30 days, hard

671
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,064
to remember everything that's

672
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,151
happened out here.

673
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:03,905
Parvati, the first one to get it

674
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,823
right.

675
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,909
Parvati moving on to the final.

676
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,744
Two more people moving on to the

677
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,620
final.

678
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,586
Candice close.

679
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,047
Does she have a key?

680
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,423
Who's it going to be?

681
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,009
Adam has a key.

682
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,178
Jonathan has a key.

683
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:30,682
Candice has a key.

684
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,476
Jonathan is good.

685
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,435
Adam is good.

686
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,064
Candice, just a second too late.

687
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,691
Jonathan, Adam, Parvati moving

688
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,527
on to the next round.

689
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,737
For this round, you will answer

690
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,446
more questions.

691
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,823
You'll use the key to unlock a

692
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,325
timber tunnel, crawl through the

693
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,576
tunnel, over a series of

694
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,578
floating pontoons, and raise one

695
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,579
final flag.

696
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,414
Winner gets immunity.

697
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,250
Survivors ready?

698
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,294
Go.

699
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,504
Here are the next questions: the

700
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,464
number of immunity challenges so

701
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,884
far, including this one, plus

702
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,177
the number of survivors at

703
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,262
tribal council during the lamb

704
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,349
shank feast, divided by the

705
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,142
number of underwater flags

706
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,685
collected in the barrel rolling

707
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,854
competition.

708
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,855
Get that right, you have the

709
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,191
number, you get the key, you win

710
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:26,113
immunity.

711
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:26,863
Adam, the first to start

712
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,241
untying.

713
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:29,866
Parvati, Jonathan, nowhere close

714
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,495
at this point.

715
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,663
Adam is right, he has a big

716
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,498
lead.

717
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,457
And if he's wrong, he'll have to

718
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,251
start over.

719
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,585
Parvati now untying.

720
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,003
Jonathan taking his time,

721
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,338
wanting to be right.

722
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:43,964
Adam already searching for that

723
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:44,589
key.

724
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,718
Is he right?

725
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,556
Adam has the key.

726
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,849
He's moving on.

727
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:54,808
Jonathan untying.

728
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,517
Parvati still trying to stay in

729
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,145
this.

730
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,480
Adam ripping through the knots.

731
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,358
Adam starts through the tunnel.

732
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:09,739
Jonathan does not have it right.

733
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,950
He's got to do his math again.

734
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,077
Adam up and over.

735
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:14,578
Parvati has the key.

736
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,830
Adam untying the last knots of

737
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,623
the timber tunnel.

738
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,918
Jonathan, still no key.

739
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,005
Parvati has to untie her knots.

740
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,218
Adam, through the tunnel.

741
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,344
One leg left, the floating

742
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,013
pontoons.

743
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,099
Can he make it in one go?

744
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:36,516
He's hanging on.

745
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,726
>> You got it.

746
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,602
>> PROBST: Struggling to hang

747
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,353
on.

748
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,063
Trying to crawl.

749
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,150
And he's doing it.

750
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,109
>> Come on!

751
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,235
>> Yeah!

752
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,448
>> PROBST: Adam first to cross,

753
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,116
casually raises his flag.

754
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,118
(<i> applause</i> )

755
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,245
Adam wins immunity!

756
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,580
>> Nice job, Adam.

757
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,790
>> Nice job!

758
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:05,921
>> Very good job.

759
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:12,344
>> PROBST: Adam, come on over.

760
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,678
Congratulations.

761
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,223
(<i> applause</i> )

762
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:16,723
Adam, safe from the vote

763
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,433
tonight.

764
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,809
But here is a fact: one of you

765
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,769
guys is going home tonight.

766
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,645
See you at tribal.

767
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,313
Grab your stuff, head on back to

768
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,732
camp.

769
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,789
>> Take a little one, and you

770
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,874
pop it.

771
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,875
>> Welcome back.

772
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,793
>> Thank you.

773
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,961
Adam won immunity today at the

774
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,754
challenge, so tonight we're

775
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,673
going to tribal council, and

776
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,591
it's looking like my number's

777
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,634
up.

778
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,052
It's upsetting to think that

779
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,345
Jonathan will get farther than

780
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,389
me in this game, and that's

781
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,349
upsetting to think that someone

782
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,809
that everyone feels-- everyone,

783
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,811
even the people in his alliance

784
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:07,148
feel that Jonathan is a snake.

785
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,526
>> Jonathan's just a slime ball,

786
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,986
and he needs to be voted off.

787
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,153
>> I mean, I understand why you

788
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:12,821
don't like Jonathan, but how

789
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,780
does this help you?

790
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,448
>> I don't care.

791
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,241
>> It doesn't help us...

792
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,325
>> I'll be at peace with myself

793
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,160
if he's voted out before us.

794
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,120
>> Honestly, I will feel like I

795
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:20,829
have won if he is voted out

796
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,830
before I am.

797
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,748
>> You're an upstanding guy.

798
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,042
>> He's behind you, Yul.

799
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,678
>> Got a flounder.

800
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,805
>> Yeah, my first flounder.

801
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,765
>> Nice.

802
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,559
>> If we can get a fire going,

803
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,353
we can cook some fish.

804
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,774
>> Adam, Parvati, and Candice

805
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,484
approached me today.

806
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,110
They really want Jonathan out of

807
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,362
the game, so they asked me, kind

808
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,822
of appealing to my sense of, you

809
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,033
know, justice and integrity, to

810
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:58,658
please vote him off first.

811
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,411
Jonathan is not my first choice

812
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,580
to kind of welcome him back.

813
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,748
Like, he's... you know, he is

814
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,040
what he is.

815
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,499
>> I think you're

816
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,167
underestimating him.

817
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,001
>> Let me finish.

818
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:08,835
I understand how he thinks,

819
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,627
right?

820
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,087
The guy is selfish, and he's

821
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:11,671
rational, right?

822
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,299
So I can predict, basically,

823
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,759
what he's going to go for.

824
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,135
I can predict, like, what makes

825
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,262
sense to him.

826
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,399
>> I'm not the ring leader.

827
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:31,775
I mean...

828
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,694
>> Yeah, you are.

829
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,031
>> Let me just... it's not that

830
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:38,865
simple.

831
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:39,866
If we change things up right

832
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,784
now, it will have other

833
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,577
ramifications, and you know,

834
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,162
obviously, I can't really talk

835
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,040
about that stuff.

836
00:27:59,052 --> 00:27:59,844
>> Adam was eating that.

837
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,387
Are you taking that away?

838
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,471
>> Oh, I'm sorry.

839
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,097
>> Yeah, what are you doing?

840
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,722
>> I didn't realize it was your

841
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,640
coconut.

842
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,849
No, no, you eat it.

843
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,309
>> No, I don't want it!

844
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:06,851
You eat it!

845
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,938
>> Then what's the problem?

846
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,814
All I did was pick it up so I

847
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,774
could share it, that's all.

848
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,817
>> Well, cut it up, eat it.

849
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,776
>> Great, thank you.

850
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,737
>> It's not that complicated.

851
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,613
>> I'll go get some more

852
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,572
firewood so we can make some

853
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,534
fish.

854
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,249
Things finally came to a head.

855
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:29,791
They've been percolating and

856
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,419
brewing, a lot of silence, a lot

857
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,671
of glares, and I'm getting a

858
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,880
little mad.

859
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,881
(<i> laughter</i> )

860
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,757
>> You did not miss me.

861
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,801
You have not been cuddly.

862
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,135
>> I missed you.

863
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,719
>> And you know what?

864
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,470
You missed your last night to

865
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,138
cuddle.

866
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:43,847
You missed your last cuddly

867
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,474
chance.

868
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,935
>> I'm uncomfortable!

869
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:49,519
>> Okay, come here, we'll give

870
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,854
you a smooch too.

871
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,126
>> Jonathan, thank you for the

872
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:13,334
fish.

873
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,502
>> Yeah.

874
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,128
>> Thank you, Jonathan.

875
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:15,712
>> You're so welcome, guys, of

876
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:16,754
course.

877
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,549
I wish it could be more.

878
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,223
>> Where'd they all go?

879
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,141
Are they eating?

880
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,851
>> Yeah, probably.

881
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,645
>> That is wrong.

882
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,980
That's coming out at tribal.

883
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:40,028
All right, I'll be back.

884
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,908
(<i> thunder</i> )

885
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,077
>> What's going on, guys?

886
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,121
>> Well, what do you mean?

887
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,664
>> I mean, since when do you

888
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,709
guys not share food?

889
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,086
This is so arrogant and so rude.

890
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,547
I can't believe this.

891
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,216
>> Didn't you call me a... well,

892
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,175
it doesn't matter.

893
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,927
>> Didn't I call you a what?

894
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,637
>> I was told that I was a

895
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,680
disgusting rat and that I should

896
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,640
be voted against tonight for

897
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,390
whatever reason.

898
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,016
>> Well, Jonathan, you're a rat

899
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,142
because you betrayed everybody

900
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,603
in this game.

901
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,229
>> Okay, well... and yet... and

902
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,605
yet...

903
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,356
>> Everybody knows that you only

904
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,398
care about yourself.

905
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,108
Yul said it this afternoon that

906
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,360
he can predict your behavior

907
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,945
because you're selfish...

908
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,655
>> Self-interested.

909
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,698
>> ...and that you're... so he

910
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,866
knows what you're going to do.

911
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,492
He knows what move you're going

912
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,952
to make because you make the

913
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:29,953
selfish decision.

914
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:30,286
>> Candice...

915
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:30,954
>> And so everybody knows that,

916
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,038
and everybody...

917
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,165
>> Candice, don't speak for me.

918
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:34,749
I can speak for myself, all

919
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:35,792
right?

920
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,876
>> Then what did you say?

921
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,627
>> This is not...

922
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,211
>> What did you say?

923
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:38,795
>> This is not how I would...

924
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:39,796
>> What did you say?

925
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,005
>> Look, I said he was a self-

926
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,507
interested, rational player,

927
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,466
right?

928
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,133
To that extent...

929
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,426
>> You said he's selfish.

930
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,427
>> ...I have certainty as to how

931
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,512
he's going to predict... that I

932
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,805
can predict his behavior,

933
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,430
because I know what's going to

934
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,181
like...

935
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:50,807
>> And you don't like Jonathan,

936
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,644
and you said that too.

937
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,980
And all these people have said

938
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,982
that, that they don't like you.

939
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,110
>> Let's talk about this meal.

940
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,194
We all came home from that...

941
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,779
>> Everybody has their days

942
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,322
where they lay down in the tent.

943
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:06,948
>> You know what?

944
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,907
That's bollocks, and you know

945
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,783
it.

946
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:09,826
The rest of us do not choose our

947
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,160
days to go lay down in the tent.

948
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:11,995
I work my ass off every single

949
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,371
day.

950
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,080
>> Yeah, because you're trying

951
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,873
to weasel your way in somehow.

952
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,874
>> But luckily you're not name

953
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,875
calling, I appreciate that.

954
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,835
>> I'm not.

955
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,627
I'm saying you're trying to

956
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,962
weasel your way in.

957
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,547
>> How dare you...

958
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,631
>> "Weasel" is a verb in this

959
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,674
situation.

960
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,842
>> How dare you imply...

961
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:26,676
>> Weasel your way in.

962
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,343
>> Excuse me.

963
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,261
How dare you imply that I'm

964
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,221
behaving differently today than

965
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,390
I have for the last 30 days.

966
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,016
You cannot say that that's true.

967
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,684
It's not true.

968
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,351
>> You know...

969
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:35,768
>> You know what?

970
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,352
And I don't even want to talk

971
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,812
about it.

972
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:38,646
You've said more than enough for

973
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,647
me.

974
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,025
Thank you.

975
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,746
>> Oh, that's what you're

976
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,622
worried about, thinking they're

977
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,456
going to be mad at you for not

978
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,541
changing your vote?

979
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,754
>> Do it again.

980
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:07,967
>> But I guess my question to

981
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:08,551
you is there's three of them.

982
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,844
Are you going to wait until each

983
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:10,762
one gets voted off to then vote

984
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,679
off Jonathan.

985
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,388
They're basically all saying the

986
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,474
same thing.

987
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:47,757
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

988
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,595
the members of our jury: Brad,

989
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,473
Rebecca, Jenny, and Nate, voted

990
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,559
out at the last tribal council.

991
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,232
I'll remind you, the jury is

992
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,150
here merely to observe.

993
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,068
They're gathering information

994
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:12,448
for a million-dollar decision.

995
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,033
Let's start with the auction.

996
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,618
Becky, the turning point was

997
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,912
when you sent Candice to Exile

998
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,498
Island for the fourth time.

999
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,874
Why Candice?

1000
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,959
>> I think just seeing her

1001
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,502
strength and her endurance, she

1002
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,545
was probably the fiercest

1003
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,004
competitor.

1004
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,298
She was the obvious choice.

1005
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,466
>> PROBST: Candice, you return

1006
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,968
from Exile Island, yet you still

1007
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,136
come back with a smile on your

1008
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,887
face.

1009
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,014
>> I'm out here because I love

1010
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,558
this game, and it's been rough,

1011
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,392
you know?

1012
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,643
There have been some low points.

1013
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,478
But like Adam always asks

1014
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,438
everybody, "Are you still

1015
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,856
smiling?"

1016
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,857
And you know, I think you have

1017
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,108
to keep that spirit up or else,

1018
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,111
you know, you'll collapse.

1019
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:50,737
>> PROBST: Ozzy, what happened

1020
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,362
when you got back to camp after

1021
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,614
the challenge?

1022
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,116
>> I spent a good amount of time

1023
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,243
looking for firewood and trying

1024
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,578
to get the fire going.

1025
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,246
Jonathan went out fishing.

1026
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,039
Candice, Parvati, and Adam just

1027
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,292
went into the tent basically and

1028
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,085
later on caused a huge ordeal

1029
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,921
with us five eating fish and

1030
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,758
them three not eating the fish.

1031
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,258
>> Not sharing the fish.

1032
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,469
>> PROBST: You say not eating

1033
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,386
the fish.

1034
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,137
You say not sharing the fish.

1035
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,889
>> Inviting us to dinner,

1036
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,766
basically.

1037
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,933
>> PROBST: All right, Parvati,

1038
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:21,350
tell me your story.

1039
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,935
What happened?

1040
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,519
>> Basically, the three of us,

1041
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,229
me, Candice, and Adam, know

1042
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,690
we're on the outside.

1043
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,983
So they have their five, and we

1044
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,859
have our three.

1045
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:30,485
And we're in the tent, you know,

1046
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,986
just spending time with each

1047
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:32,320
other, you know.

1048
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,947
Apparently it pissed some people

1049
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:35,990
off that we weren't helping

1050
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,201
around camp.

1051
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,577
So Jonathan gets back and

1052
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,828
decides that he doesn't want to

1053
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,705
share his fish that he's caught.

1054
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,582
>> Everybody but Jonathan, I

1055
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,249
think, was cool with us working

1056
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,293
together.

1057
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,294
I think... I mean, haven't

1058
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,420
talked to Jonathan, so I don't

1059
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,047
know what his thoughts are.

1060
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,048
>> PROBST: Are you and Jonathan

1061
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,925
not speaking to each other?

1062
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:54,717
>> I don't really care for

1063
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,219
Jonathan at this point.

1064
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,261
>> It's just interesting the

1065
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,138
more comfortable he gets with

1066
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,932
his position in this game, the

1067
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,725
more his true colors show, and

1068
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,267
it just shows the level of

1069
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,268
immaturity.

1070
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,437
I'm sorry, but I'm half his age,

1071
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,605
and I'm twice as mature as he

1072
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,272
is.

1073
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,190
>> I agree.

1074
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:09,816
>> Now it's all starting to come

1075
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,191
out.

1076
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,984
I understand that you guys are

1077
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:12,819
hurt or disappointed or

1078
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:13,736
whatever.

1079
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,654
But you have five people

1080
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,696
working, and you have three

1081
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,322
people who don't do any work.

1082
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,407
At what point does the five

1083
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,992
people who are working and the

1084
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,910
three people who are basically

1085
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,203
waiting for the dinner bell so

1086
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,287
that they can get fed-- you

1087
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,247
know, when is that not

1088
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,374
appropriate?

1089
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,458
>> I think it's an arrogance

1090
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,751
thing.

1091
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,627
"We got the numbers.

1092
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,336
You're going down.

1093
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,337
You're on a sinking ship.

1094
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,505
You know, we got the food.

1095
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,132
We don't have to feed you."

1096
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,883
And you know, all of them have

1097
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,717
said that they don't like

1098
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,718
Jonathan.

1099
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,302
>> Everyone knows how you are.

1100
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,346
It's not a secret.

1101
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,014
>> What am I?

1102
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:42,598
>> You're a rat!

1103
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,182
I mean...

1104
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,058
>> That's a fact, that I'm a

1105
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:44,642
rat?

1106
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,226
I don't even know what that

1107
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:45,977
means.

1108
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,644
>> You're just...

1109
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,228
>> I'm a cancer.

1110
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,020
I know.

1111
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:48,980
That's enough out of you.

1112
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,064
>> Is that right?

1113
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,107
There's absolutely no reason for

1114
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,024
you to be around now though.

1115
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,735
>> Says you, jack-- says you.

1116
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,487
I've earned my place here today.

1117
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,363
>> Jonathan, you have.

1118
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,990
You have outwitted your place...

1119
00:35:59,073 --> 00:35:59,615
>> Oh, come on.

1120
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,491
>> ...to be here today.

1121
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,701
>> You're just tired of hearing

1122
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,577
the truth, man.

1123
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,036
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

1124
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,205
>> That I'm a rat and a cancer?

1125
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,290
>> Come on.

1126
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,291
>> That's the truth?

1127
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,250
>> You are.

1128
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,209
>> Okay.

1129
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,294
>> PROBST: Well, just sitting

1130
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,753
here, it seems to me that rather

1131
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,130
than a tribe of five and a tribe

1132
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,673
of three, there's a tribe of

1133
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,008
three, with Adam, Candice and

1134
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,510
Parvati, a foursome with Ozzy,

1135
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,387
Sundra, Becky, and Yul, and

1136
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,389
there's Jonathan on the other.

1137
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,348
>> I would disagree.

1138
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,433
>> PROBST: Well, you're the UN.

1139
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,475
I'm expecting the UN to come in

1140
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,102
here and make everything nice.

1141
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,562
(<i> laughter</i> )

1142
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,646
>> Look, I mean, obviously when

1143
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,190
we tell them things, right,

1144
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:32,940
we're going to do it in a way

1145
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,649
that's going to serve our own

1146
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,609
interest.

1147
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,568
So, you know, I wouldn't take

1148
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,652
them at their word.

1149
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,403
The way they're painting the

1150
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,529
picture is not accurate.

1151
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,072
I'll leave it at that.

1152
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:40,656
>> He's the puppet master, and

1153
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,241
we're all puppets in his little

1154
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:42,992
play.

1155
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:43,618
>> Come on, what do you expect

1156
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:43,868
me to do?

1157
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,161
Look, we're all here trying to

1158
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,287
win.

1159
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,371
You can't fault me for that.

1160
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,205
>> I do not at all.

1161
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:48,831
I respect completely all four of

1162
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,583
you.

1163
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,667
>> And I'd have a lot more

1164
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,127
respect, and so would the people

1165
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,295
on the jury, if they cut loose

1166
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,588
of their cancer that they have

1167
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,422
hooked on them.

1168
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,048
>> Even if all three of us were

1169
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:57,340
next to go.

1170
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,008
>> Yeah, one, two, three after

1171
00:36:59,091 --> 00:36:59,717
that.

1172
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,760
>> Boom, boom, boom, sitting

1173
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,844
ducks.

1174
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,930
>> Yeah.

1175
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:04,805
>> PROBST: Jonathan, a lot has

1176
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,973
been said tonight.

1177
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,017
You have been the hub of 90% of

1178
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,226
it.

1179
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,478
How are you feeling right now?

1180
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,604
>> I feel fine.

1181
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,688
I mean, you know, one never

1182
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,440
wants to hear some of the names

1183
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,983
that I've been called, you know.

1184
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,276
So what am I going to do?

1185
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,444
Move on with the game.

1186
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,196
Luckily for me right now, I'm in

1187
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:20,780
a better position than I was

1188
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,406
when I was with them.

1189
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,075
>> PROBST: Candice, what are you

1190
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:24,492
basing your vote on?

1191
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,078
What can you guys do to try and

1192
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,913
turn this?

1193
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,790
>> Jeff, we've tried everything,

1194
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,457
but they're going to vote how

1195
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,417
they're going to vote, and maybe

1196
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,543
they're going to vote with us,

1197
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,336
and maybe they're not.

1198
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,838
I just wanted to say that this

1199
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,090
is a decision that the jury is

1200
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,174
going to make.

1201
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,259
They need to know what's really

1202
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,969
going on around camp, because

1203
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:47,932
it's been kind of ugly.

1204
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:48,849
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to

1205
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,684
the vote.

1206
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,434
Adam, you have the immunity

1207
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,602
necklace.

1208
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,395
Do you want to give it up?

1209
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:52,812
>> I'm keeping it.

1210
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,146
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1211
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,897
Adam.

1212
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:55,690
There is also the hidden

1213
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,774
immunity idol.

1214
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,401
You all know that Yul found it,

1215
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,735
but he could have given it to

1216
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,861
someone else.

1217
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:01,487
Whoever is in possession of the

1218
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,115
idol, if you need to play it

1219
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:04,740
tonight, you would present it to

1220
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,826
me after the vote.

1221
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:07,994
The person with the next highest

1222
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,161
number of votes would be sent

1223
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,246
home.

1224
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:10,705
It is time to vote.

1225
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,333
Ozzy, you're up.

1226
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,720
>> I'm not going to sacrifice

1227
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,888
myself for you, and tonight, you

1228
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,641
showed me your true colors.

1229
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,611
>> Wow, piece of work.

1230
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:02,798
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1231
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,676
votes.

1232
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:13,768
Once the votes are read, the

1233
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,602
decision is final.

1234
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,436
The person voted out will be

1235
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:15,936
asked to leave the tribal

1236
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,646
council area immediately.

1237
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,399
I'll read the votes.

1238
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,901
First vote, Jonathan.

1239
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:25,738
Candice.

1240
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,031
One vote Jonathan, one vote

1241
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,283
Candice.

1242
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,451
Jonathan.

1243
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,452
Two votes Jonathan, one vote

1244
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,539
Candice.

1245
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,291
Candice.

1246
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,209
Two votes Candice, two votes

1247
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,796
Jonathan.

1248
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,631
Jonathan.

1249
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,632
That's three votes Jonathan, two

1250
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:48,427
votes Candice.

1251
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,720
Candice.

1252
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,221
We're tied, three votes

1253
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:55,851
Jonathan, three votes Candice.

1254
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,311
Candice.

1255
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:57,937
That's four votes Candice, three

1256
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,689
votes Jonathan.

1257
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,738
13th person vote out and the

1258
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,198
fifth member of our jury,

1259
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:09,615
Candice.

1260
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,408
That's five, that's enough.

1261
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,159
Unless you have the hidden

1262
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:12,993
immunity idol, you need to bring

1263
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,703
me your torch.

1264
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:36,642
Well, the kiss is nice.

1265
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,477
Maybe if it were love, he'd have

1266
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,230
given you the immunity necklace.

1267
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,483
Candice, the tribe has spoken.

1268
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,360
>> Still smiling, guys.

1269
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:47,236
Have fun.

1270
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,737
Love ya.

1271
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,824
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.

1272
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,960
Well, I think tonight's tribal

1273
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,796
council speaks for itself.

1274
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,589
Grab your torches.

1275
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,006
Head back to camp.

1276
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,050
Good night.

>> Ah!

1288
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,322
I feel like my finger's about to

1289
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:31,572
fall off.

1290
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,532
>> That could be bad.

1291
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,158
I mean, I don't know if you can

1292
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,659
stay out here with that.

1293

1294

pressure.

1295
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,579
>> They're going to say anything

1296
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,538
they can, because if you fall

1297
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,539
for it, then I'm gone; they're

1298
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,123
still around, waiting to take

1299
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,374
you guys out.

1300
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,417
>> I feel like I'm kind of like

1301
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,293
the godfather or something,

1302
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,378
arranging a hit on somebody.

1303
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,176
>> Wow, what can I say?

1304
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,094
What a fabulous time I've had

1305
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,513
out here playing this game.

1306
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,432
I think I can look myself in the

1307
00:41:58,515 --> 00:41:59,767
mirror and be comfortable with

1308
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,227
the way I played this game,

1309
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:01,644
definitely.

1310
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,979
That little kiss with Adam, it

1311
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,356
was a nice way to leave.

1312
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,067
We were partners through this,

1313
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,153
and it was sincere.
