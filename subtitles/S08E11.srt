>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,087
<i>Survivor:</i>
Merge was on everyone's mind

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,923
when the tribes received body
paint with tree mail.

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,925
>> If I was a betting
woman, and I was in Las Vegas,

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,969
I'd say we're merging.
>> PROBST: But the merge

6
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,929
never materialized.
Reach in and pick a buff.

7
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,558
You're now a member of Chapera.
Instead, everybody drew buffs to

8
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,269
randomly mix up the tribes.
What, did you think we were

9
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,730
merging?
Just switching things up.

10
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:25,108
Against all odds, the tribes
stayed intact, merely changing

11
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,445
names, with one exception.
Amber-- the only one to change

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,572
tribes.
>> I definitely feel like

13
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,615
I'm the only one who got screwed
in this whole situation.

14
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,785
>> PROBST: The new Chapera tribe
lived it up at their new beach.

15
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,954
>> I realized immediately
that we were so much better off

16
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,623
over here.
>> PROBST: But the new Mogo Mogo

17
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,126
tribe felt their new home was
less that adequate.

18
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,754
>> It's a crap camp.
>> PROBST: While his tribemates

19
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,131
missed their old camp, Rob just
missed Amber.

20
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,091
>> It kills me to have
her over there by herself.

21
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,677
>> PROBST: The Immunity
Challenge tested the tribe's

22
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,263
knowledge of<i> Survivor</i> history.
Mogo Mogo is right.

23
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,766
You win immunity.
And, in a bold move, Boston Rob

24
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,977
offered Lex a deal if he would
save Amber.

25
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,981
Before Tribal Council, Amber was
aware she was the obvious

26
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:09,110
target, and tried to turn the
heat on Jerri.

27
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,529
>> Please, Kathy, keep me
in the game.

28
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,698
Vote for Jerri.
>> PROBST: And Jerri went after

29
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,117
Amber, the outsider.
>> Boston Rob will tell

30
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,453
you anything to keep Amber
around.

31
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,455
>> This is when the game
changes, when you have to start

32
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,791
making really hard decisions.
>> PROBST: And, at Tribal

33
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,002
Council, Lex and Kathy took a
gamble on Rob's future loyalty,

34
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,631
and voted Jerri out of the game.
Jerri, the tribe has spoken.

35
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,384
Nine all-stars are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

last night at Tribal Council was
horrible.

41
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:28,791
I cut her loose to keep Amber
around as a favor to Rob.

42
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,128
When I need to cash in with Rob,
I'm sure he'll deliver.

43
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:42,221
He's good on his word.
>> We think that Amber's gone,

44
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:48,186
He's good on his word.
>> We think that Amber's gone,

45
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,316
and it was a very somber mood
around camp.

46
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,778
Rob is really sad.
That was not only his strong

47
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,698
alliance, but, I mean, they're
really dating out here.

48
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:10,792
>> I hope Amber is still here.
I said some prayers last night

49
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,835
and this morning.
Not much I can do about it.

50
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,048
Maybe Lex came through for me,
and that would be great. Ahh!

51
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:21,511
>> I've never seen Rob
all screwed up like this, but

52
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:26,975
it's like when a calf's sucking
its mama's titty and, when you

53
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,019
wean that calf, it bawls, and
it'll go crazy.

54
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,522
It tries to go through fences
and bushes...

55
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,025
Rob's the same way.
And it'll take about three days

56
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,195
to get a calf weaned from its
mother.

57
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:44,867
A human is about the same.
>> This situation throws

58
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,413
you into a weird kind of arena
where you never know who is

59
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,165
going to be your ally.
You may think one person is

60
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,210
perfect to align with, and then,
all of a sudden, you're, like,

61
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:57,380
what the hell happened, you
know?

62
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:02,051
>> We can have, like, a
little silent alliance going.

63
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,888
You know, kind of cover your
tracks and be ready.

64
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,725
You know what I mean?
>> Mm-hmm.

65
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,227
>> I'll be completely
alone in this game if Amber is

66
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,063
gone.
I can't trust anybody.

67
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,860
I kind of have a mark on my
back, so I got to watch both

68
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,863
shoulders at all times.
>> I promise you right

69
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,364
now.
>> Okay.

70
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,616
>> Here's the thing.
>> If it comes down to it...

71
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,618
>> If we have...
>> I promise you, I will

72
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,911
fight for you.
>> I will never write

73
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,954
your name down.
>> All right.

74
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,414
>> I will never...
>> I promise you.

75
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,416
>> ...write your name down.
>> I will never write

76
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,917
your name down.
>> That's it.

77
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,711
I won't write your name down.
There's no way.

78
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,921
I would never screw you over.
I'm not going to say that.

79
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,923
>> I didn't say that to
anybody in this game, Alicia.

80
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,093
I did not say that to any one
person in this came.

81
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,306
>> Neither did I.
>> Okay.

82
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:07,867
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Chapera, come on in!

83
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,958
(Jenna L. squeals)
>> She made it.

84
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,586
>> PROBST: Jerri voted out at
the last Tribal Council.

85
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,632
Remaining tribe members: Kathy,
Shii Ann, Lex and Amber.

86
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,593
>> Hi, guys.
>> Hey.

87
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,969
>> What's up, Kat?
>> Hey.

88
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,472
>> PROBST: Okay.
Let's get to today's Reward

89
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,433
Challenge.
Even though you are still two

90
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:37,105
tribes, it is an individual
Reward Challenge.

91
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,149
Here's how it's going to work.
All nine of you will start out

92
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,819
on the floating platform.
On my go, all nine of you will

93
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,655
dive down and retrieve one of
seven pots.

94
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,324
Two without a pot will be
eliminated.

95
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,285
We'll work our way from nine
tribe members to seven to five

96
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,663
until we are left with only
three.

97
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,331
We'll then move to a final
round.

98
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,167
The three remaining tribe
members must transport a

99
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,130
heavily weighted crate from the
ocean to the shore.

100
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,715
The first person to cross the
finish line with their crate

101
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,509
wins Reward.
Want to know what you're playing

102
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,718
for?
>> ALL: Yes.

103
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,179
>> PROBST: For the winner, a
helicopter will land immediately

104
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,515
following the challenge, take
you to a resort.

105
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,185
You'll have a nice shower,
you'll have a massage, facial, a

106
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,896
huge feast.
You'll spend the night-- have a

107
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,357
real bed to sleep on.
>> Oh, my God!

108
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,735
>> PROBST: In addition, the
winner of the challenge will be

109
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,530
allowed to bring two people from
either tribe.

110
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,115
>> That's a biggie.
>> Wow.

111
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,159
>> That's big.
>> PROBST: Worth playing for?

112
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,660
>> ALL: Yes.
>> PROBST: All right, pick your

113
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:40,835
spots out, wait for my go.
Here we go, guys.

114
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,504
Nine tribe members looking for
seven pots.

115
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:49,343
Survivors ready...
Go!

116
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:54,432
Get that pot and get back here.
First seven move on.

117
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,571
Everybody has a pot except for
Shii Ann and Jenna.

118
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,282
You two are out.
We're now down to seven.

119
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,952
Looking for five pots.
Survivors ready...

120
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,622
Go!
First five move on to the next

121
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:32,470
round.
Everybody back up with their

122
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,181
pots.
Amber, Kathy are out.

123
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,809
>> Me and Big Tom were
fighting over it.

124
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,605
>> PROBST: We are down to five.
The first three to get a pot

125
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,275
move on to the final round.
Survivors ready...

126
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,238
Go!
We're looking for three pots.

127
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:04,168
We have our final three.
Boston Rob, Rupert, Lex.

128
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,839
The other six-- you guys-- can
swim on in.

129
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,138
All right!
It is the final round!

130
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,308
First survivor to get their
crate across the finish line

131
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,978
wins Reward.
(Shii Ann whooping)

132
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:27,233
Survivors ready...
Go!

133
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:34,657
Boston Rob swimming out,
diving down.

134
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:52,300
Rupert moving with his crate.
Lex moving with his crate.

135
00:09:52,383 --> 00:10:02,351
Boston Rob still underwater.
Rupert with a bit of a lead.

136
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:14,655
Boston Rob still underwater.
Rupert with a bit of a lead.

137
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:19,910
Rupert's now on his feet.
He's carrying the crate on his

138
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:24,081
shoulder.
Boston Rob right behind him.

139
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:30,796
Boston Rob still in it.
So is Lex.

140
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,424
Boston Rob trying to get it up
on his shoulder.

141
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,509
It's too heavy.
>> Go! Go!

142
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,261
>> Rupert, he's coming!
Come on, Rupert!

143
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,972
>> Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
>> PROBST: It's a race to the

144
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,560
finish.
Got to cross the line.

145
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:50,274
Lex falls down.
(Jenna L. screaming)

146
00:10:50,358 --> 00:11:01,535
Rupert wins Reward!
>> Way to go, Robbo!

147
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,290
>> PROBST: Rupert, get over
here.

148
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,583
Nice job.
>> Won one.

149
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,087
>> Nice job, Rupert.
>> Thank you.

150
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,423
>> PROBST: Okay, big decision.
You can take two people with you

151
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,425
on this Reward.
It can be any two people you

152
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,222
want.
Who's going with you?

153
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,977
>> I honestly wish
everybody could come, I do, but

154
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,940
Amber, you can make up for
that 24 hours you just spent

155
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,943
away from us.
You're coming back.

156
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,279
>> Thank you!
>> It was a hard one, I

157
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,240
know, being away.
>> Nice.

158
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,284
>> Jenna.
We spent the whole time

159
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,787
together.
The first Reward we win, we

160
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,792
share it.
(cheering)

161
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,628
>> PROBST: All right, Rupert,
Jenna, Amber, helicopter's

162
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,630
coming in.
>> Chocolate for me, please.

163
00:11:54,713 --> 00:12:04,682
Double chocolate.
>> Great.

164

>> My baby is going to say,
"That's my daddy.

169

He is the toughest daddy in the
world."

gorgeous girls.

181
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,856
What is this?
>> It's a skirt.

182

It was a great reward.

183

Oh, my God, Amber, they have

We're going to get pretty for

good, I wanted to be pretty.

207

this smooth for so long.

find this stuff, but you can

You've got Boston Rob who's

00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:15,792
Rupert first?
I'm here because of him.

325
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,045
>> Don't go soft on me.
I know it sucks.

326
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,547
I promised him the same thing.
He came up to me, first person

327
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,424
he came up to.
>> It's not even that.

328
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,970
It's not that... I'm just...
I don't know, I'm scared.

329
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,764
>> Don't be scared.
>> What if they're

330
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,809
targeting us?
You and I are stirring all this

331
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,896
up.
Do you know what I mean?

332
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,898
There's too many plans floating
around and too many people are

333
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,108
talking.
They're going to realize that

334
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,402
it's all coming down to us very
soon and then they are going to

335
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,112
get rid of us instead of getting
rid of somebody else.

336
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,115
>> It's not coming down to
us because as soon as Lex is

337
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:52,621
gone, Big Tom doesn't have a leg
to stand on.

338
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,791
I mean, this is a game, Amber.
We're playing for a million

339
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,127
bucks over here, you know?
Like, let me tell you something,

340
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,588
Jenna and Rupert and Big Tom,
they're all gonna try to stick

341
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:05,967
it in our backs, too, all right?
>> We've got our work cut

342
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,805
out for us because we have so
many deals going along with so

343
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,099
many people.
We have deals with Lex and

344
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,433
Kathy.
We have deals with Rupert and

345
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,519
Jenna.
We have a deal with Big Tom.

346
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,813
Who the hell knows what's going
on with Alicia?

347
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,732
It's insane.
My mind is like, freaking out

348
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,901
right now.
>> Yeah, I definitely

349
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:27,864
missed you.

All right.

351

Let's get to today's first
individual immunity challenge.

352
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,349
Tribal immunity is no more.
This is what you covet.

353
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:59,020
>> Wow. That's cool.
>> PROBST: As long as you are

354
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,356
wearing the immunity necklace,
you are safe from the vote at

355
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,525
Tribal Council.
When you don't have this on, you

356
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,736
are vulnerable, and now that
we are in an individual game, it

357
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,405
becomes all that much more
important.

358
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,324
Today's immunity challenge will
test your skills in the water.

359
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,828
First round is a traditional
hold-your-breath competition.

360
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,248
You will be divided into groups
of men and women: The two men

361
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,334
who stay down the longest will
move on to the final round;

362
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,879
the two women who stay down the
longest will move on to the

363
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,881
final round.
For the final round, you will

364
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,676
race along a ladder, which is
tethered to the ocean floor.

365
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,345
Along the way, you'll be
releasing a series of buoys.

366
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,099
The first person to release all
ten buoys wins immunity.

367
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,352
Here's the twist.
We will run the final leg twice.

368
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,397
Two men will run the final leg.
The winner receives immunity.

369
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,232
Two women will run the final
leg.

370
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,067
The winner receives immunity.
>> Oh, my God.

371

Tribal Council, two people...

00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,579

in the game-- huge stakes.

>> PROBST: Swim out.
Wait for my go.

378
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,418
All right, guys. Here we go.
The two women that stay down the

379
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,254
longest and the two men to stay
down the longest move on to the

380
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:11,176
final round.
Three, two, one, go down.

381
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:39,329
Alicia and Jenna are up.
First three women are up.

382

Amber and Kathy are moving on.
Rupert can't hang on any longer,

00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:50,006
Rob, Tom and Lex still fighting
for the final two.

384
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,644
Big Tom's out.
Lex and Boston Rob moving on to

385
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,647
the final.
Kathy and Amber moving on to the

386
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,648
final.
All right.

387
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,735
First woman to release all ten
buoys wins immunity.

388
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,613
Survivors, ready?
Go!

389
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:24,165
Kathy and Amber both have their
first buoys up.

390
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:29,671
Dead even at two.
3-3.

391
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,055
They're dead even at four buoys
each.

392
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,183
Amber with her fifth.
Amber with a slight lead.

Kathy with her fifth.
Amber leads six buoys-five.

395
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,361
Kathy still struggling.
Get a breath.

396
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:59,409
Kathy, you're still in it.
>> I can't get the knot.

397
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:04,873
>> PROBST: Fatigue starting
to set in.

>> PROBST: Let's go, Amber, get

404
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:51,252
down and get a buoy.

00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,922
Kathy has her tenth buoy and the
flag.

Incredible effort.

00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,054
(cheering)
Here we go.

408
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,640
Kathy already has immunity.
We are looking for a second

409
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,017
immunity winner.
Survivors, ready?

00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:16,069
Go!

Go!

Tied up at five.

419
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,690

He's got it!
Boston Rob comes from behind,

422
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:57,045
wins immunity!
Hell of an effort, guys.

423
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,214
Congratulations.
Nice job.

424
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,592
>> Thank you.
You are safe at the vote

425
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:08,848
tonight.
Nice effort.

426
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,726
Safe at the vote tonight.
>> Thank you. Thank you.

427
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,479
>> PROBST: For the first time,
guys, two people will be safe at

428
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,397
tonight's Tribal Council.
Everyone else is vulnerable.

429
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:26,491
See you at Tribal.
>> There's something very

430
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:41,714
See you at Tribal.
>> There's something very

431
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,134
telling about the fact that
we've been here now together

432
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,596
merged for a whole day and
there's been absolutely-- he

433
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,598
hasn't lifted a finger to make
us feel comfortable.

434
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,268
>> No, he's pulling our chain.
>> Yeah, he's yanking on our

435
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,395
chain.
>> I know, and I'm so

436
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:59,816
discouraged by it.
>> I realize that I made a huge

437
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,610
mistake.
I made a potentially game-ending

438
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:07,115
blunder in agreeing to keep
Amber and get rid of Jerri, and

439
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,451
I think I may be about to pay
for it.

440
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,831
>> I just want to let you
know that I appreciate

441
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:19,961
everything you did to save
Amber, but myself, Amber, Big

442
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:24,257
Tom, Jenna, Alicia and, uh...
>> Rupert.

443
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,427
>> ...Rupert have agreed to
stay together as a group.

444
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,013
>> I can't even believe
what I'm hearing.

445
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,681
>> I know.
>> Let me tell you

446
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,058
something right now.
That was not a game or strategy

447
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,810
decision.
>> It was a strategy decision.

448
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,312
You have nothing to be angry
about.

449
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,314
>> It was a brother coming
to another brother saying friend

450
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,942
to friend, and you know what, I
had my game all worked out, and

451
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,320
if I had gotten rid of Amber,
you know what I would have come

452
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,487
in here with?
I would have come in here with

453
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,449
my numbers advantage and I did
that just because you're my

454
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,951
friend.
>> In fact, I-I-I

455
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,121
completely... my own game.
I screwed my own game up.

456
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,665
>> I'm sorry, buddy.
>> I just can't believe

457
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,375
what I'm hearing.
>> You're asking me to

458
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,960
screw everybody else now for
you.

459
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,962
>> You've got more
allegiance to them than you've

460
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,007
got to me... after asking me for
a special friend favor.

461
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,425
>> I made an agreement with
them.

462
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,344
I asked you for a favor.
>> It's about being

463
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,387
betrayed by my friend.
It's about getting a knife in

464
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,889
the back.
>> Like, honestly, I don't know

465
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,849
what you want me to say, Lex.
I know, like...

466
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,185
>> I want you to say that
you're going to be truthful to

467
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,187
the word you gave me.
>> The word I gave you--

468
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,689
make no mistake about it, Lex--
between you and I, and you want

469
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,192
to put our friendship on the
line, I'll put our friendship

470
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,445
on the line over this.
The word I gave you was that if

471
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,407
I can take care of you, I will.
I'm sorry, I cannot.

472
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,161
>> We were always
thinking of bringing you along,

473
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:39,123
babe-- always, always until the
bitter end.

474
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,669
He was proud to bring you to the
final four.

475
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,046
>> I'm sorry.
>> That's brutal.

476
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,839
>> It is.
>> It's brutal.

477
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,049
>> Brutal.
>> Absolutely brutal.

478
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,218
>> Brutal.
Man, I should have listened to

479
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,679
you: "No friends in this game."
>> I asked you for a favor

480
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,056
and if there was anything I
could do, Lex, I would.

481
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,766
>> That's just it.
There's a lot you can do.

482
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,394
>> No, the only thing I can
do is to break my word and screw

483
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,521
everybody else.
>> I just, I just don't

484
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,939
understand.
I mean, you're breaking my

485
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,857
heart, I can't...
I can't even believe it.

486
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,235
>> ...and that's why I'm
crying because I actually came

487
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,779
to him.
>> I-I would...

488
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:13,491
>> I'm sorry you feel that way.
I really, truly am.

489
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:17,745
I'm really sorry that you feel
that way.

490
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,919
>> Despite the fact that
Boston Rob is a really nice kid,

491
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,089
there's something inside of him
that came out in Marquesas

492
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,677
that's still here.
And it's just so sad.

493
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,431
It's so sad.
>> He put a knife in my back.

494
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,392
>> Yeah.
Well, this is what I'm doing.

495
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:44,105
I don't want to stay here.
(crying)

496
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,108
>> Sweetie pie, come here.
>> No, I don't want it.

497
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,985
>> Honey...
>> I don't want it.

498
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,321
>> I don't blame you.
>> I don't believe it's

499
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,991
just a game, not when
friendships are involved, so I

500
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,785
would like to give my immunity
to Lex tonight and if I get

501
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,415
voted off, I'm gone.
I mean, my options are to do

502
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,459
that or to come back here
cowering.

503
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,419
I'm giving it to you tonight.
I hate it.

504
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,588
>> No, no, no, no.
>> This isn't worth it.

505
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,256
>> No, no, you earned it.
>> I can go make a

506
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,800
million dollars somewhere.
>> No, no, no, honey. No, no.

507
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:17,847
>> Look. Look at me.
If Lex got voted out tonight and

508
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:23,811
Boston Rob got away with it,
uh-uh.

509
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:33,905
I am not doing that.
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal

510
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:55,468
I am not doing that.
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal

511
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,137
Council, where, once again,
tonight you must vote somebody

512
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,057
out of this game.
A little different stakes

513
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,309
tonight, though.
The person voted out tonight

514
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,353
will become the first member of
the jury.

515
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,523
So, from this point forward, it
not only matters who you vote

516
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,360
out, but how you vote them out,
because ultimately only two of

517
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,653
you will make it to the final
two.

518
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,405
The other seven will make up the
jury, who will decide who wins

519
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,991
the million dollars.
Having said that, let's get to

520
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,495
the last few days.
Rupert, did the game ratchet up

521
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:26,082
a notch today?
>> Today when we got

522
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:31,379
back to our camp, everything was
tested, you know... alliances

523
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,550
were tested, physical endurance
was tested.

524
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,427
Your mental abilities,
everything was tested.

525
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:43,015
Today was a very hard day.
>> PROBST: So there's more to

526
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,853
the looks of despair and huge
bags than just the physical.

527
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:50,231
It's the mental part of what is
happening right now in the game.

528
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,275
>> Yes, sir.
>> PROBST: Can you get it back?

529
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,235
Is tomorrow another day?
>> Tomorrow is most

530
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,612
definitely another day.
>> Hopefully the sun comes

531
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,282
out tomorrow.
We need the sun.

532
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:04,078
>> Tomorrow is most
definitely another-- a new day.

533
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,747
As the rain comes...
>> PROBST: As the rain starts to

534
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,584
send you a signal that Mother
Nature may not be on the same

535
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,587
game plan as you.
>> You got two choices,

536
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,424
Jeff, laugh or cry.
>> PROBST: Lex, how much has the

537
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,260
game changed in the last 24
hours, now that it is an

538
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,721
individual game?
>> The game has changed in

539
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:26,767
a huge way for those of us who
came from Chapera.

540
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,730
For us, life has become much
more of a true game of survival,

541
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,815
a struggle.
It's a different game for us for

542
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,109
sure.
>> PROBST: So it's a long, cold

543
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:38,613
night with eight people who will
be going back that aren't

544
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,657
necessarily getting along at
this point, fair to say, Jenna?

545
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,618
>> Very fair to say.
There's a lot of arguments,

546
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,120
today, centered around
loyalties, alliances, tribal

547
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:52,126
voting lines, and who is going
tonight, and game plans are

548
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,923
spoken aloud and it wasn't nice
for anyone to hear.

549
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,425
>> PROBST: Amber, you going to
go back to a camp divided?

550
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,344
>> I think... Yeah.
I think going back to camp

551
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:05,932
tonight will be very
uncomfortable, um, but it's a

552
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:10,645
very important vote, a very
important vote.

553
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,813
>> I've got something I
want to say.

554
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:17,818
I know we're playing a game, but
I know, like, emotions are real

555
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:23,783
and feelings are real out here,
and regardless of what happens,

556
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:30,164
I just want everybody to know
that if I'm your friend, I'm

557
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,835
your friend, and after this is
over, you don't want to be my

558
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:42,051
friend, then I can't do anything
about that...

559
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:47,139
But friendship is lasting.
>> PROBST: I just want to give

560
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:51,227
everybody here a hug.
Man, you guys look awful.

561
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,312
All right.
Let's get to the vote.

562
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,775
For the first time ever, we have
two people with immunity, Kathy

563
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:01,028
and Boston Rob.
As always, if you guys want to

564
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,323
give that immunity up for some
reason, you certainly can.

565
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,535
Boston Rob, you're shaking, is
that a no or just a shiver?

566
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,912
>> I covet this.
>> PROBST: You're not giving it

567
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:14,000
up.
Kathy, you keeping yours?

568
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,714
>> I thought about it.
I'm keeping it.

569
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:24,051
>> PROBST: Okay.
Kathy cannot be voted for.

570
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:28,347
Boston Rob cannot be voted for.
Everybody else is fair game.

571
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:32,810
It's time to vote.
Big Tom, you're up.

572
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,913
>> I'd much rather be
casting this vote for your

573
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:57,668
little errand boy, but you're
just gonna have to do.

574
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,304
>> Hey, buddy, sorry about the
vote.

575
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,640
Thanks for keeping Amber around.
I hope we can get over this,

576
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:21,734
man.
(Kathy sighs)

577
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:31,243
man.
(Kathy sighs)

578
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,954
>> Amber, you didn't have
to tell me that Boston Rob and

579
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,957
you were going to bring us to
the final six.

580
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:42,379
I just don't like getting lied
to that big.

581
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:55,226
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

582
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,405
>> PROBST: Once the votes are
read, the decision is final.

583
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,116
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

584
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,829
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

585
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:22,711
First vote: "Amber."
"Amber."

586
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:32,471
That's two votes Amber.
"Lex."

587
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,474
"Lex."
That's two votes Lex, two votes

588
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:43,107
Amber.
That's three votes Lex.

589
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:49,530
That's four votes Lex.
Tenth person voted out of

590
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:54,034
<i>Survivor: All-Stars</i> and the
first member of our jury, Lex.

591
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,744
That's five.
That's enough.

592
00:40:55,828 --> 00:41:04,587
You need to bring me your torch.
>> Good luck, y'all.

593
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,884
>> PROBST: Lex, the tribe has
spoken.

594
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:24,106
It's time for you to go.
Well, you've lasted 27 days.

595
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,692
I know it's been a long, wet,
rainy day.

596
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,861
The rain has stopped.
Maybe it's a sign.

597
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:32,406
Either way, you got to dig deep.
You got 12 days left-- a one-in-

598
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:35,284
eight shot at a million bucks.
Grab your torches and head back

599
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,244
to camp.
Good night.

600
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:47,338
(theme song playing)
>> PROBST: Next time

601
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:53,802
(theme song playing)
>> PROBST: Next time

602
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,388
on<i> Survivor:</i> The All-Stars get a
glimpse of home.

603
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,390
Maybe give you what you need to
get you through these last 11

604
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,769
days.
And Kathy stirs things up.

605
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,980
>> Yeah, you should.
I don't want her to win.

606
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,732
>> I see what's happening
right now.

607
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,151
I think they are switching.
>> I think we've got some

608
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:13,530
last-minute scrambling going on
in Panama today.

609
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,287
>> Wow.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't

610
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,791
disappointed, but I came into
this game the wealthiest man in

611
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,793
the world.
I have an amazing wife, two

612
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,754
beautiful sons, a loving family
and the greatest group of

613
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,297
friends a man could ever hope
for.

614
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,341
Everything above and beyond that
is gravy as far as I'm

615
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,260
concerned.
Big Tom, you get out there and

616
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,678
give 'em hell.
I'll be rooting for you all the

617
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,804
way. Love ya.
