Jon?
>> PROBST: Tempers flared

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,217
after Rupert was voted out.
>> Every time a plan went down,

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,429
you put it together.
>> PROBST: And Christa was

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,931
blamed for throwing out the
fish.

7
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:17,809
>> We can't sabotage the tribe.
>> I didn't do it.

8
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,602
>> PROBST: But Sandra was the
true culprit.

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,439
>> They're not going to enjoy
Rupert's fish-- screw that.

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,275
>> PROBST: At the reward
challenge, the castaways were

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,611
surprised by the arrival
of their loved ones.

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,157
( sobbing )
>> Come here.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,451
>> PROBST: But Jon was told
by his best friend that his

14
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:42,584
grandmother had died.
The tribe let Jon win the reward

15
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:46,004
so he could spend time
with his best friend.

16
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,299
As part of the reward,
the rest of the tribe was

17
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,136
exiled to a deserted island,
giving Jon and his friend

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,555
exclusive use of the Balboa
camp, where they celebrated

19
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,600
the success of a devious lie.
>> That was a brilliant

20
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,935
performance, sir.
>> He was like, "If you come

21
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,979
down here, tell me my grandma
died."

22
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:05,648
>> The fake dead grandmother
could easily go down

23
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,486
as the dirtiest thing
ever to be done in this game.

24
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,071
>> PROBST: When the tribe
returned, Jon went right to

25
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,325
work, strategizing with Burton.
>> I just want it to be the two

26
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,786
of us in the final two.
>> PROBST: But Sandra and

27
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,579
Tijuana were secretly listening
in.

28
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,665
>> It was better for her to hear
it with her own ears coming out

29
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,084
of their mouths than for me
to put things in her head

30
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,337
and for her to have doubts.
>> PROBST: At the immunity

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,007
challenge, the survivor's
vocabulary skills were tested.

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,468
Darrah wins immunity.
Nice job.

33
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,180
Before Tribal Council,
Jon pleaded with his two enemies

34
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,433
in a desperate attempt
to save Burton's skin.

35
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,019
>> Jon, you just don't know
how much we distrust you.

36
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,480
>> I swear on my grandmother.
That's a big freakin' deal.

37
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,233
>> PROBST: The plea worked,
and at Tribal Council, it was

38
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:52,987
Tijuana who was voted out.
The tribe has spoken.

39
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:57,158
Six are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

I think he laid it on us good,

45

and we didn't look at the
bigger, bigger picture, and,

46
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,417
um, now we're screwed.
>> Tribal Council was very

47
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,922
interesting, based upon a
last-minute decision

48
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,634
to get rid of T.
Jon made an agreement that he

49
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:42,138
would take Sandra and I to the
top four, along with Burton.

50
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,683

>> I don't know whether or not

to believe him, because...
I can't believe him ever.

52
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,522
>> Burton's totally cool,
so last thing I want

53
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,984
for you guys is doubt.
Christa made me swear on my

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,362
grandmother's grave that I would
carry Christa and Sandra

55
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,990
to the final four.
And I-I believe I used

56
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,992
the phrase before:
Promises are like

57
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:10,625
wicker furniture and fat women:
easily broken by Jonny Fairplay.

58
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,377
I've rolled the dice a lot
in this game.

59
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,629
>> Don't go rolling it on me.
>> Look, I'm happy now.

60
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,631
Don't make me unhappy.
Let's just ride this thing out

61
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,175
to final four; we'll be fine.
>> All right.

62
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,511
I really hope he's telling us
the truth.

63
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,013
Probably not.
I don't know.

64
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,975
I think that Sandra and I
have a better chance

65
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,185
of getting ahead
with four women than Burton,

66
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,898
Jon, myself and Sandra.
>> Are you ready?

67
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,192
>> Yeah.
We don't have to bring

68
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,988
a thousand woods, right?
Just one, quick, dry wood run.

69
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,198
Me and Christa,
we've been tight since, like,

70
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,368
day number two or three.
But without Darrah right now,

71
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,413
I can't move another step.
I can't take another step

72
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,207
without knowing where Darrah
stands right now.

73
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,210
She voted for Burton last night.
She shouldn't have a problem

74
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,587
voting for him
either tomorrow or the next day.

75
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,882
The deal we made yesterday
to save Burton's skin

76
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,218
was that you or Lill
would go first,

77
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,429
but it didn't matter to us
who went when, right?

78
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,140
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Now, I want the guys to go.

79
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,558
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> You understand what I'm

80
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,308
saying?
>> Yeah. Uh-huh.

81
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,227
>> You think that'll work?
>> Yeah.

82
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,771
Sandra's already talked to me
this morning.

83
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,565
I mean, I'm sure there'll be a
bunch of different ones coming

84
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,608
up to me, trying to sway votes
and stuff.

85
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,778
So, I'm just going to play it,
you know, let them come up to

86
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,573
me and see what's going on.
And then, I'll decide what I

87
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,950
need to do after that.
>> I still think that Burton

88
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,327
is a bigger threat than Jon.
>> I do, too.

89
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,913
>> Then, we'll get Jon on the
next shot because Jon is just

90
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:37,128
like a girl.
>> Right.

91
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,910
>> Wait till you see
what's in the bag.

92
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,497
>> Oh, my goodness.
>> Oh, Big Daddy.

93
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,749
>> Should we save some for
lunch?

94
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,418
>> Yeah, I'm cool with whatever.
>> We got mail.

95
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,130
>> Come read it over here.
>> "It's nice to be pampered.

96
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,467
For you, it's been a while.
Refresh yourself inside and out.

97
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,928
We're talking life and style.
This luxurious reward,

98
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:30,640
you'll really want to get.
But if you move too slowly,

99
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,476
all you'll get is wet."
>> Whenever I hear "wet" and

100
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:45,238
"water," that's awful for me.
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

101
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,160
31 days.
Congratulations.

102
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,996
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,165
>> PROBST: For today's reward
challenge, you will compete in

104
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,877
teams of three, which we will
randomly draw in a moment.

105
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,338
Here's how it works:
You're going to compete

106
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,675
in a water obstacle course.
First tribe member starts

107
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,802
on the first platform
where you must cross

108
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,139
a balance beam.
You'll then dive in and untie

109
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,474
two paddles from two separate
wooden crates.

110
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,352
You'll then swim
to a second platform,

111
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:20,022
join your second tribe member.
You'll dive back into the water

112
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,693
and release three underwater
floating barrels.

113
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,321
Together, the two of you will
then swim to a third platform.

114
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,992
You'll untie a third paddle,
join your third tribe member,

115
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,161
and all three of you
will swim to shore.

116
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,580
You'll then get in your boat and
paddle back to the start.

117
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:39,292
First tribe to get back
to the start in their boat

118
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,627
with all three tribe members
wins reward.

119
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,212
Want to know what
you're playing for?

120
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,006
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Well, after 31 days,

121
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,260
you deserve a little TLC.
So, today's reward is an

122
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,220
overnight spa.
You'll be flown to a remote

123
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,057
resort island.
You can then enjoy a massage.

124
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,101
For dinner, you'll order
whatever you want

125
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,353
and you'll awaken to a
breakfast.

126
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,231
There is a swimming pool.
So, for the winning tribe:

127
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,067
your swimsuits.
>> Oh!

128
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,196
>> PROBST: The first clothes
you've seen from those suitcases

129
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,574
you left behind 31 days ago.
Worth playing for?

130
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,909
>> Yes.
>> Hell, yeah.

131
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,912
>> PROBST: All right.
There are three silver coins

132
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,206
and three gold coins.
They are numbered

133
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,583
"one," "two" and "three."
"One" refers to the first

134
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,085
position;
"two" to the second position;

135
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,795
and "three" to the third
position.

136
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,256
Open up.
Let's see our tribes.

137
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,299
>> One?
Oh, Lord.

138
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,384
>> PROBST: Sandra, you are in
the first position.

139
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,719
You're going to be swimming
the most.

140
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,763
>> Oh, my God!
>> PROBST: Christa, you are

141
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,182
with Sandra at second position.
Burton, you're the tail.

142
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,227
You will be swimming the least.
For you, Darrah, it's all on

143
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,854
you.
Then Lill and Jon.

144
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:49,946
Head on out to your spots.
For a great reward,

145
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:56,786
Survivors ready?
Go!

146
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,454
Oh.
Sandra took a chinner

147
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:03,251
on the first platform.
Darrah with just a bit

148
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:10,841
of a lead, starting to work
on her first paddle.

149
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:16,973
Sandra at work
on her first paddle.

150
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,016
Darrah swimming toward her
second paddle.

151
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,814
Sandra has her first paddle.
Darrah has the second paddle.

152
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,818
She's got to get up
on the platform.

153
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,655
Go!
Darrah and Lill

154
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,699
onto the second stage.
Sandra still working

155
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:38,995
on her second paddle.
Darrah and Lill heading

156
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,832
for the barrels.
>> Slide above the end!

157
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,669
Push it!
>> PROBST: Got to release three

158
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:57,513
barrels, Darrah.
Darrah has her first barrel.

159
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:02,184
Lill working on that third
paddle.

160
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,894
Let's go, Sandra.
Get that knot off.

161
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:10,860
You guys are not that far
behind.

162
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,696
Darrah has her second barrel.
Sandra still having trouble

163
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,743
with her second paddle.
Darrah has her third barrel.

164
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,162
Lill working on
that third paddle.

165
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:26,000
They've got the third paddle.
Lill, Darrah and Jon in the

166
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,836
water on the third stage.
>> Undo it! Undo it!

167
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,046
Quick! Quick!
>> PROBST: Sandra has the

168
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,548
second paddle.
Christa helps her up.

169
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,216
Get in the water.
Take the paddles.

170
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,676
You've got it.
I'll get you the second

171
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,553
you get here.
>> Come on, girls.

172
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,389
>> PROBST: Jon, Lill and Darrah
really having a hard time

173
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:51,734
with their boat.
Christa has the first barrel up.

174
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,116
Christa has the second barrel
up, making up a lot of ground

175
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:08,084
quickly.
Christa has her third barrel.

176
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:14,632
Lill, Darrah and Jon starting
their paddle back to the finish.

177
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,218
Stage two is done.
Burton's now in this.

178
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:22,932
Swimming back to shore,
going for the boat.

179
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,600
It's going to be
too little, too late.

180
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,727
( yells )
It's over.

181
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:31,440
Lill, Darrah, Jon.
Overnight spa reward.

182
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,785
Lill?
Bring your boat in.

183
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,870
You guys will be taken to a
plane, dinner, anything

184
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,956
you want off the menu,
breakfast tomorrow,

185
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,835
good night's sleep,
air conditioning.

186
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,651
>> This could be the best reward
in the history of the game.

187
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,446
>> This is awesome.
>> After Jon, D, and I won the

188
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,823
award, we got on a boat,
took a tour of the island,

189
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,660
and got put on a plane.
>> ( Lill gasps )

190
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:28,038
Look at this!
>> Oh, I cannot wait to get in

191
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,959
that bathtub.
>> Food, here we come.

192
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,171
>> Let's party!
>> It was amazing to see our

193
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,717
home from above.
There's our island, guys.

194
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,346
>> Yep, there's our island.
>> It sure is.

195
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:54,190
>> I wish it was me.
>> ( Jon speaks inaudibly )

196
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,692
>> It is so gorgeous.
It was a breathtaking view.

197
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,111
It was something
that I'm not going to forget

198
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,198
for a long time.
>> We've only seen

199
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,534
the Pearl Islands via our boat.
Words can't describe

200
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,204
how big this place is.
I mean, there's just ocean,

201
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,830
ocean, ocean, ocean,
and the biggest islands

202
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,373
you've ever seen
and the smallest islands

203
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,501
you've ever seen.
There was just so many of them

204
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:19,340
everywhere.
>> That was fabulous.

205
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,218
( cheerful scream )
>> Oh, wow.

206
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,179
>> Oh, my gosh!
Look at this!

207
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,432
>> We had no idea how cool
the hotel would be.

208
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,895
And when we got here, it's,
uh... this is absolute paradise.

209
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,357
>> Oh, my God!
>> The room is huge.

210
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,944
There was a big living room,
a huge bedroom,

211
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,904
a big bathroom, mirrors.
>> Whoo!

212
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,156
>> ( screams )
>> Wow.

213
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,116
>> Oh, my gosh...
>> It's not me!

214
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,204
>> Look at my eyebrows.
>> That first look at myself

215
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,916
in a mirror was so shocking.
Oh, my gosh!

216
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,378
>> I have lost so much weight.
>> I hadn't seen myself for...

217
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,006
30-some days.
>> Shower.

218
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:06,136
>> Shower!
>> Oh, this feels so good.

219
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,601
>> We might tell D she's, uh...
she's top three, just to keep

220
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,938
her from jumping.
>> I won't say a word.

221
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,816
>> This was, bar none, the
greatest reward we could be

222
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,237
given at this stage of the game.
It gave me a chance, personally,

223
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,949
to talk with D and Lill
without, uh, worrying about, uh,

224
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:31,078
Sandra and Christa overhearing,
and gave me a chance to, uh,

225
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,539
heal up some of my, uh, war
wounds from the first, uh,

226
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:44,258
30-plus days.
>> Oh, baby.

227
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,969
The masseuse put cucumbers
over my eyes.

228
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,430
I guess they do something
for the skin.

229
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,974
I think I needed a whole
cucumber to do anything for my

230
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,643
my skin.
>> Oh, this is the best.

231
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:59,607
The Pearl Islands are paradise.
However, it sucks with the bugs.

232
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,151
It sucks with some of the
people.

233
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,945
It sucks with the food.
Yeah.

234
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,157
>> Oh!
>> Here, this is paradise and

235
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,993
that's an awesome feeling.
>> Oh, my gosh, this lady is

236
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,621
good.
>> I feel sorry for Burton

237
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:20,461
today.
>> Hope this doesn't have

238
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,714
to be a clean fillet,
'cause I am shredding

239
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,174
this thing.
>> Did Jon talk to you

240
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,383
about everything?
You're not going

241
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,218
to screw us over?
>> No, I haven't.

242
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,554
I haven't even talked
to him about anything.

243
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,350
Jon said, if we saved you,
that Darrah and Lill would go.

244
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,518
>> Okay! I, I haven't
even talked to Jon.

245
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,521
He just said...
>> Jon told us the wrong thing.

246
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,065
He said that we'd be in
the final four;

247
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,151
it would be two and two--
you and him and Sandra and I.

248
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,237
>> I'm in... I'm in a bit
of an odd position right now,

249
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,574
in that I am alone in the camp
with Sandra and Christa.

250
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,369
And I haven't talked to Jon
fully about this, so I don't

251
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,537
know what to tell them.
I mean, I've lied to them

252
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,998
enough.
I guess I could continue to lie.

253
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,917
But at the same time,
I don't want to piss them off,

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,418
because they're going
to be on the jury

255
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,338
and I want to be the one
they vote for.

256
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,007
We all came together
and we both saved each other.

257
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,051
Well, if Christa wasn't on
the chopping block,

258
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,220
it'd be one thing.
You didn't make that

259
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,557
voting decision to save me.
>> Burton has never been one

260
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,435
to talk to me and Christa
clearly about anything.

261
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,729
But let it be known
that if it wasn't for me

262
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,065
and Christa,
Burton would not be here today.

263
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,610
You would think that
that would count for something.

264
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,613
And then here he is saying
that he, he can't promise us

265
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,990
third and fourth.
That's a bunch of baloney.

266
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,242
The first chance I get
to send him home,

267
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,370
he's going home.
>> It's just hard to tell.

268
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,080
I can't tell when
people lie anymore.

269
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,581
Like, people can tell
when I'm lying.

270
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,458
I'm looking at them just like...
>> Well, the thing

271
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,127
is around here is, like...
just, everyone's lying

272
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,753
to everyone.
The only time you know

273
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,088
where someone stands
is when they vote

274
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,756
at Tribal Council.
The conversation that Sandra

275
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,386
and I had with Burton
was a real eye-opener for me.

276
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,221
It was, uh... I saw the light
suddenly.

277
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,432
>> I mean, no matter how strong
your best friend is out here,

278
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,101
at the end of the day,
it's not as strong as

279
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,812
a million dollars.
>> At this point, it's every man

280
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,274
for themselves, I see it.
We're not here

281
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,735
to make best friends.
We're not here to do anything

282
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,737
like that.
We're here to play a game

283
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:17,453
and get as far as we can.
>> Ooh!

284
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,955
Oh, we got pajamas.
>> No way.

285
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,707
( Lill squeals ):
Oh, you're kidding!

286
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,293
>> Oh, they're silk.
>> Oh, my God.

287
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:29,965
>> On our bed was silky pajamas.
We put them on, pranced around,

288
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,427
showed them off.
This is so exciting.

289
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,682
>> This is so wonderful.
>> I think we have a table

290
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,684
for three.
>> When we got to dinner,

291
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,436
I was starving.
And I, I...

292
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,521
It was so nice to be able
to open a menu up

293
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,357
and to be able to read.
I did remember how to read

294
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,819
after all this time.
My mouth is watering.

295
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,112
>> Chicken fingers
will definitely be

296
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,656
a good appetizer.
>> What about the clam?

297
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,742
>> Lill, you really want
to do clam

298
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,161
after 31 days of eating
nothing but seafood?

299
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,623
I'll order for you guys.
For dinner, she would like

300
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,125
the filet mignon.
>> I love a man that takes over.

301
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,002
>> Me, too.
>> How would you like

302
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,337
that prepared?
>> Um, medium rare.

303
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,005
>> Medium rare.
>> Jon ordered all the food

304
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,174
for all of us.
I enjoyed that.

305
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,260
You know, I, I like when a guy
takes the initiative.

306
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,471
Rock and roll, man.
Rock and roll.

307
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,973
I'm a great date.
I have a pretty extensive

308
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,351
fine food knowledge,
and I was able to show that off.

309
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,853
( Lill gasps )
>> Oh, my goodness.

310
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,230
Oh, my...
What's that?

311
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,982
>> That's bruschetta.
>> You're a whole lot more

312
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,193
smarter than me.
>> There's a few more sides

313
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,195
to Jonny Fairplay
than these girls

314
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,906
had any clue about.
And as Lill said, I'm much more

315
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:43,872
than just a pretty face.
I have noticed Sandra and

316
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,583
Christa will never give me a
vote.

317
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,545
>> Out in the water...
>> Yeah.

318
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,880
>> ...they said to me,
"We're going to kick out Jon

319
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,882
"and we're going to kick out,
um, Burton.

320
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,886
>> Are you with us?"
When we were eating,

321
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,724
we talked a lot about what's
been going on behind the scenes.

322
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,396
I know that Jon had to promise
Christa and Sandra a lot

323
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,357
in order for them
to back us up to get rid of T.

324
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,067
I had to promise on my
grandmother to them.

325
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,861
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Don't do that.

326
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,363
I had to.
She's looking down here at you.

327
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,074
I know.
She'll forgive me.

328
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:22,077
I had so much fun in explaining
to, uh, D and Lill that,

329
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,038
uh, Christa made me swear
on my grandmother's grave.

330
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,584
And I told Lill that it upset
me so much to have to do that.

331
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,086
And I was like, "One of her
last wishes was that,

332
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:38,760
that I win."
( laughing )

333
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:45,475
( laughing )
Lill is very antsy

334
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,440
and there was lots of strategy
that we needed to go over, uh,

335
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,401
for the last stage of the game.
There's a lot of people

336
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,777
worried about you, Lill.
>> Why?

337
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,613
>> Because.
Who whispered this

338
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,949
morning that like...
>> Lill is the queen of sitting

339
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,454
around the camp going...
>> I am not!

340
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,414
>> Yes, you are.
I am not!

341
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,293
>> You hurt my feelings...
>> Lill, I'm going to keep

342
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,502
hurting your feelings
unless you start

343
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,463
telling the truth.
>> I'm going to bed.

344
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,256
>> Lill, that's not helping
anything.

345
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,300
>> I'm going to bed.
You hurt my feelings.

346
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,010
>> Lill, you're...
you're doing more damage

347
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,970
than anything.
>> Lill, get in here.

348
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,140
We got stuff to talk about.
>> Jon talks down to me

349
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:28,685
like I'm some idiot.
Lill, it's the truth.

350
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,187
Make me sound
like a big-mouth.

351
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,314
It is not the truth.
He wants to show

352
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,359
that he's in charge and...
you know, I've seen that before.

353
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,945
And I'm thinking
that may be his way

354
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:44,284
of separating himself from me.
( thunder crashing )

355
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,629
>> So, I was thinking
about Darrah.

356
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,965
I tell you, after that
that challenge, I fear her

357
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,384
most in something like that,
'cause I think she has

358
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,886
a good chance of winning.
>> Yep. Watch your step on here.

359
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,389
>> This morning, Christa and I
went out looking for mussels

360
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,307
to eat.
And she brought up a strategy,

361
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,477
again, what I was thinking.
But she is willing

362
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,187
to make concessions,
and she's looking, um,

363
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:17,192
to get farther in the game.
So, it's a good thing to know.

364
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,861
Well, let me ask you this...
Without having talked to Jon,

365
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,531
I have no idea what's going on.
>> But...

366
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,827
>> But... would you vote Sandra
out next if that was the case?

367
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,870
>> I would go along with it,
if that's what you guys

368
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,622
wanted me to do
and get rid of her first.

369
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,583
But from a strategic
standpoint,

370
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,211
and just seeing how Darrah
is most likely

371
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:38,880
to win immunity...
I mean, I know that it's

372
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,549
probably not going to be
something super physical,

373
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,385
but Darrah was a cheerleader
and she can hang in

374
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,178
for long periods of time,
you know?

375
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,223
Right.
>> Nothing Christa said this

376
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,891
morning really surprised me.
I had a feeling she would

377
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,686
stab Sandra in the back if she
needed to.

378
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,522
She does really want Darrah
to go first.

379
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:59,568
All the options are still open,
but it might not be bad

380
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,446
to have Christa in the top four.
Because if Jon did do

381
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,407
something funny,
um, I'm pretty sure I could beat

382
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,367
Christa at Tribal Council.
I think she's rubbed a lot

383
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,327
of people the wrong way.
I would like to see you

384
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,079
in the top four.
I really want to go

385
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,915
to the top four.
And I will do what I can

386
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,917
to get you there.
So, you...

387
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,920
you got my word on that.
>> I think that Burton

388
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,214
understands that this is a game,
and we're all trying

389
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,592
to get ahead.
Me stabbing Sandra in the back

390
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,763
and getting rid of her...
isn't anything personal.

391
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,058
It's nothing about that.
It's about getting farther ahead

392
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,478
and doing the right thing
to win this game.

393
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,621
>> Good morning.
>> This morning,

394
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:58,919
we awoke to a big, fresh pot
of coffee and, uh, bacon, eggs,

395
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,130
the most amazing banana nut
bread on the planet,

396
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,967
fresh O.J, fresh fruit.
Great way to start the day

397
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,096
and yet another advantage
that we have over the others

398
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:20,649
going into the final.
>> I see Survivor as a big game

399
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,943
of human chess.
I felt that I could feed off

400
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,320
Darrah's greed and basically
say, "Hey, look, you know,

401
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,323
there's no way anyone
can beat Lill in a jury."

402
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,991
And she agreed.
I was like, you know, "So,

403
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,702
"without, uh, without anyone
knowing, how about me and

404
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,621
you Final Two?"
And she did

405
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,956
the math in her head,
and she was, like,

406
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,668
"I think you're exactly right."
>> Okay.

407
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,880
I won't say anything else
about it.

408
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,216
>> It's going to be me and...
and Jon in the Final Two.

409
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,843
I mean, Jon, you know,
he's a snake.

410
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,679
He lies, but...
he also tells the truth, too.

411
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,014
And, I don't...
I know he's not sitting here

412
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,934
lying to me about
going to the Final Two.

413
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,822
>> I want to know everything.
Start from when

414
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,700
the boat left...
>> When Jon, Lill and Darrah

415
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,077
returned from the reward,
I was happy to see them,

416
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,830
because I was glad
the reward was over for them.

417
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,833
I'm still jealous.
But I wanted to hear everything.

418
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,252
I want to hear everything
from the beginning to the end.

419
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,920
>> All right, so, let me...
We'll start at the beginning.

420
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,548
Big bed,
enough for three people,

421
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,677
shower, commode, toothbrush,
shampoo...

422
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,762
>> (screams)
>> I wanted to kind of

423
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,223
play it down a little bit,
but he told them

424
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,059
every detail there was.
And I thought, "Well, okay.

425
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,396
It's not me telling it
and bragging on it."

426
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:45,609
Filet mignon, cheeseburger,
another filet mignon.

427
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,237
>> Bastard!
>> We ate for four hours.

428
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,448
( Jon laughing )
>> Get out.

429
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:55,035
>> Jon, please tell me
you're at least hung over.

430
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,079
Well, they're taking
it pretty good.

431
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,789
>> But, um...
>> All a front.

432
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:04,461
All a front.
>> So, what did you

433
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:09,132
guys talk about?
>> Everything's set.

434
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,260
I told Lill
"top three" wh-when Darrah

435
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,430
was in the shower.
I told D,

436
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:20,602
"There's no way we can beat Lill
or, uh, Burton in a jury."

437
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,978
I was, like,
"So, it's me and you."

438
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,231
She goes, "I was thinking
the exact same thing."

439
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,817
>> After talking to Jon, it
sounds like he did a great job,

440
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:32,280
basically promising
Lill and Darrah, um, enough

441
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,283
so that they should never break
this alliance.

442
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,286
I'm not worried about D,
and I'm not worried about Lill.

443
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,455
>> Well, then, who's next?
>> Huh?

444
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,123
>> Who's next?
>> Christa's next.

445
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,458
>> So, you're going
to blindside Christa?

446
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:49,422
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.

447
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,925
>> Is that cool with you?
>> Yeah, I mean...

448
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,510
Why are you flip-flopping
on Christa?

449
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,928
No, no.
I'm not flip-flopping.

450
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,639
>> You can't be nice
on any of these screwing-over

451
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,599
people, you know?
Like, we both have

452
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,685
to be equally as evil.
>> Yeah. Dude, we're both...

453
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,938
>> Okay.
>> My strategy at this point in

454
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,315
the game is to work with Jon.
Jon's the bad cop,

455
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,818
I'm the good cop.
As we kick these people

456
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,362
out of the game,
if it all works as planned,

457
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,115
they will be mad at Jon
and not me.

458
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,492
Assuming nothing changes,
you and I are guaranteed top

459
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,785
two.
>> I know.

460
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,328
>> So, neither of us will
change.

461
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:30,422
>> That's... it's a guarantee.
>> Oh, man...

462
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:43,518
>> That's... it's a guarantee.
>> Oh, man...

463
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,314
I just want to sleep.
( mutters )

464
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,483
This game runs my life
24 hours a day.

465
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,694
>> I know it does.
>> I've had two dreams

466
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,529
since I've been here
that weren't related

467
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,323
to the game.
>> Are you still,

468
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,367
you know, I'm asking...
Are you still thinking

469
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,705
that we're the Final Two?
>> I'm really not thinking.

470
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,249
I... don't want to think
that far in advance.

471
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,419
Okay, you're telling me now that
you've had second thoughts.

472
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,546
That's not true.
I think

473
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:17,052
two Tribal Councils in advance.
>> Last night, I couldn't sleep.

474
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,012
And I got up
and went to the fire.

475
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:22,223
I asked him, "So, are you still
comfortable with this...

476
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,518
you and I at the end?"
And he said, "Let's just do

477
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,397
one at a time."
>> I can't help but feeling

478
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,734
you're having second thoughts.
( muttering indistinctly )

479
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,403
>> Yeah, but Lill,
that's in your head.

480
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,115
I'm not having thoughts.
>> Okay. All right.

481
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,617
I just want
to be prepared

482
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,205
that I know where I stand.
I am not going to screw you

483
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,750
over, okay?
>> Okay.

484
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,295
What I have told Lill
is that I will never lie

485
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,798
to her in this game.
I told her I'd take her as far

486
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,007
as I could.
And I do have

487
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,760
an allegiance with her, and I do
have an alliance with her.

488
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,637
But I have never promised her
top two.

489
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,142
>> Well, I have a feeling
I'd better make immunity, then.

490
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,062
>> It ticks me a little bit.
Matter of fact, it pisses me off

491
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,648
a little bit, but...
what can I do about it?

492
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,484
Um... the only thing
that would save me is to

493
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,987
win immunity at the end.
Then that may even justify me

494
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:28,081
to turn my back on him.
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

495
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:33,378
to turn my back on him.
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

496
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,009
All right, let's get to today's
immunity challenge.

497
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,096
Darrah, give it up.
Nice to have it on, isn't it?

498
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:49,310
>> Yeah, it feels good.
>> Immunity back up for grabs.

499
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,647
For today's immunity challenge,
you will fire traditional

500
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,649
pirate muskets.
They've been modified

501
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:58,153
to shoot flares.
You'll be shooting at targets.

502
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,779
You each have three targets.
First person

503
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,491
to hit all three targets
wins immunity.

504
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,829
Everybody else, vulnerable
at tonight's Tribal Council.

505
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,458
Take your spots.
Wait for my "Go."

506
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:19,382
First three:
Christa, Lill and Sandra.

507
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,677
Christa, you're up first.
Ever shot a gun before?

508
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,262
>> Never shot a gun
in my entire life.

509
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,389
>> PROBST: Let me...
let me give you a hand.

510
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,974
Yeah, put this hand...
under here, right

511
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,018
under here, like you're...
There you go.

512
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,895
And you're gonna
pull this back, and

513
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,607
then you're gonna
fire the trigger.

514
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,653
>> PROBST: Look at that.
First time she shoots a gun,

515
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,698
hits her target.
One target down for Christa.

516
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,201
>> Nice shot.
>> PROBST: Lill.

517
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:55,585
Little low.
Sandra.

518
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,046
Little low.
Step back.

519
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,881
Next three, step in.
Jon, Darrah

520
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,218
and Burton.
Jon... looking

521
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:08,056
for your first target.
Just a little to the left.

522
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,225
>> ( sighs )
>> PROBST: All right, Darrah,

523
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,395
show them how it's done.
I know you want immunity again.

524
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,190
Darrah connects.
On the board with her first

525
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,026
target.
Nice shooting.

526
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:25,031
Burton.
Nails his first target

527
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,909
on his first hit.
End of the first round...

528
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,412
Christa has one hit,
Burton has one hit,

529
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,915
Darrah has one hit.
Next three, up.

530
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,918
Everybody rotate one position
to your right.

531
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,755
Sandra, looking
for your first hit.

532
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:45,927
Takes her aim.
Fires a little low.

533
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,431
Christa, looking for
your second target.

534
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,267
Look at that.
Christa nails another target.

535
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:57,564
Two for two.
Lill takes her aim.

536
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,817
Lill just low again.
Step back.

537
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,111
Next three, up.
Burton, hit your target

538
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,948
on your first shot.
Burton with his second shot,

539
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:12,120
looking for a second target
to stay tight with Christa.

540
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:19,168
And he just misses, just low.
Jon, looking for his first hit.

541
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,297
Jon low.
All right, Darrah.

542
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,800
Looking for your second hit.
And she does.

543
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:28,136
Good shot.
Darrah on the board

544
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,429
with two targets.
Step back.

545
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,514
Next three, up.
Here's where we're at:

546
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,808
Christa on the board
with two hits,

547
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,102
Darrah with two hits,
Burton with one.

548
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:41,816
Christa, looking for her
third and final target.

549
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:44,527
Oh!
>> Damn, I was happy for you.

550
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,486
>> Wow. Hit the wood.
That was close.

551
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,198
>> PROBST: Hit the wood.
Close, but no cigar.

552
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:56,456
Lill connects.
Lill on the board.

553
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:00,001
Sandra with her first hit,
on the board with one.

554
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,170
Here's where we're at:
Christa on the board

555
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,088
with two hits,
Darrah with two hits,

556
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,675
Lill, Sandra, Burton
each with one.

557
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,969
Darrah, looking for her third
and final target.

558
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:14,515
If she hits it,
she'll win immunity.

559
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,060
And she hits it.
Whoo! Darrah has hit

560
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,520
all three targets.
Darrah wins immunity

561
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:24,233
for the second time.
Get up here.

562
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,152
Once again,
the smallest girl

563
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,030
out here is the safest.
The other five of you,

564
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,366
somebody going home.
Head back to your camp.

565
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:35,536
I'll see you guys
at the Tribal Council.

566
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,228
>> Congratulations, Darrah.
>> Deadeye Darrah.

567
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,439
>> I almost won immunity.
I almost, almost always

568
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,067
win immunity,
but that's never good enough.

569
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,319
I feel absolutely vulnerable.
You know,

570
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,030
right when you think something,
uh, things go completely...

571
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,701
opposite.
>> We turned the tables once,

572
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,744
I'm sure we can
turn the tables again.

573
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,912
It's going to be
the women, watch.

574
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,414
I'm going to go home.
I feel like

575
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,582
I'm going to go home now.
You got saved once.

576
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,752
You're about to get saved again.
>> We want Burton gone, because

577
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,587
he's the strongest one
out here.

578
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,423
Although he hasn't
won these immunities,

579
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,091
but that doesn't mean anything.
Physically,

580
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,261
he's stronger than we are,
and to put it all on an equal

581
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,430
playing field, we want
all the females together

582
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,724
till the end.
Would you be willing

583
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,101
to vote him off tonight?
>> Burton?

584
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,270
>> Yes or no?
>> No.

585
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,397
>> No? You're going
with who, with Lill?

586
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,442
>> Yeah, I'm voting for Lill.
So, Lill is it tonight?

587
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,611
Mm-hmm?
>> I just want to make sure

588
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,280
everybody was on
the same sheet of music.

589
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,407
>> I think he's already
telling her right now.

590
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,744
>> Really?
I feel bad.

591
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,012
>> There's a word
in the English language,

592
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:21,893
uh, called "naive" and, uh,
some people are that,

593
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:26,731
and, obviously, those people
are playing this game.

594
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,823
>> I'm being told that
it's still Christa

595
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,659
that will be leaving tonight,
but that doesn't mean

596
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:43,456
that I can't, you know, organize
my stuff, pack my shells.

597
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:51,130
Never take anything for granted.
>> They're not going

598
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,673
to give up Lill.
That's bull...

599
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,176
>> It would throw everything
off.

600
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,221
They're not giving up Lill.
Jon is a snake.

601
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,389
Jon will never be anything
other than a snake,

602
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,725
but the fact is
that Christa keeps telling me,

603
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,729
"Sandra, I honestly believe him.
"He swore on his grandmother.

604
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,941
Therefore, he can't be lying."
If I were you, I'd be

605
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,526
looking out for myself.
You need to look

606
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,860
out for you.
You and me.

607
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,862
Well, and this is how
we're going to stay alive.

608
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,533
This is how we're
going to stay alive.

609
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,827
>> Trust is nothing at this
point in the game.

610
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,495
It's cutthroat.
Everybody wants

611
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,997
to get to the end.
Everybody wants to go

612
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,041
one more place.
Lying is the way

613
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,544
to go out here.
Everybody has done it,

614
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:39,637
and everybody has done it well.
>> PROBST: Now, bring in the

615
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:51,691
and everybody has done it well.
>> PROBST: Now, bring in the

616
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,027
members of our jury--
Ryno...

617
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,780
Rupert...
and T, voted out

618
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:06,956
at the last Tribal Council.
33 days you've been out here.

619
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,960
Tonight, I want you to catch me
up on where this tribe is at

620
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,755
as we head into the six days.
Jon, at this point in the game,

621
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,591
would you describe the game
as "friendly," "mean,"

622
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:22,388
"competitive...?"
>> I would best describe

623
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,725
this point in time in the game
as the most hope-filled,

624
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,103
in which you have
to hope that the people

625
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:31,814
that you're aligning
yourself with are telling you

626
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,818
the truth.
Hope that you can outlast them,

627
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,946
hope that you're carrying
the right person to the end.

628
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,741
Burton, do you think this game
somehow gives you a license

629
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,453
to lie and betray and cheat?
>> It's, it's part of the game.

630
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,914
You've got to deceive people.
You have to make them think

631
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,458
one thing and do another.
I mean, it's just like any

632
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,126
competitive game.
You're trying to fake

633
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,962
out the other team,
and you're trying to get

634
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,797
farther at their expense.
>> PROBST: Christa, have you

635
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,925
lied in this game?
>> Uh...

636
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,637
I think I've lied a few times.
Um, definitely, I've kind

637
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,473
of tried to have this
philosophy from day one

638
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,266
not to lie to anybody
or at least just,

639
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,352
if I don't have to say
anything at all, you know,

640
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,771
I don't have to say it.
>> PROBST: Sandra,

641
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,856
who would you hate
to go up against

642
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,526
in the Final Two?
Lill. Why?

643
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,446
Everybody loves Lill.
She, um...

644
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,616
>> Aw...
>> I mean, like, to go

645
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,702
up against Lill
would be suicidal, and, uh,

646
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,287
she's the only one
here that I...

647
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,873
I feel like that about.
Lill, does it worry

648
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,125
you a little bit
that you're the oldest

649
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,212
Survivor out here,
you represent the Boy Scout,

650
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,881
and everybody loves you, in a
game in which

651
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,009
you want to put yourself against
somebody that people don't like?

652
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,388
It worries, it worries me
that the jury would

653
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,848
base their decision on somebody
that is nice.

654
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,352
Um, there's more to it than
nice; there's strategy there,

655
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,522
not just something...
someone that is nice.

656
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,525
>> PROBST: Christa, why not you
tonight?

657
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:02,071
>> Um,I think I've rubbed some
people the wrong way...

658
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,991
a lot of people the wrong way,
and that might be

659
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,369
one reason that I
might stick around tonight

660
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,705
and not be voted off.
>> PROBST: So, back

661
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,750
to the likability factor,
it might help you tonight that a

662
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,086
couple of people don't like you.
Everything is completely

663
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,672
unpredictable all the time,
you know?

664
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,842
There's no trust here.
It's all about hope, you know?

665
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,386
Jon, do you trust your
relationships in this game--

666
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:30,141
right now?
>> Yes.

667
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,184
>> PROBST: Sandra, you trust
your alliances?

668
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,687
>> Yes.
>> PROBST: Christa, how about

669
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,731
you?
>> Yes.

670
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,357
>> PROBST: Lill?
>> Yes.

671
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,233
>> PROBST: Burton?
>> Yeah.

672
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,361
>> PROBST: Darrah?
>> Yes.

673
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,405
>> PROBST: So, we just sat here
tonight and talked about

674
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:48,200
lying and betrayal and deceit,
but you all trust

675
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,287
your relationships.
This is going to be interesting.

676
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,955
Darrah, you're wearing immunity.
Want to give it up?

677
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,623
>> No.
>> PROBST: She's keeping it.

678
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,459
Darrah's the only person
you can't vote for.

679
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,586
You all trust each other.
You have no idea what

680
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,713
the vote's gonna be.
So let's find out.

681
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:04,383
Jon, it is time to vote.
You're up.

682
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,980
>> Whether you like it or don't
like it, learn to love it,

683
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,899
because it's the best thing
going today.

684
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:34,080
Whoo!
>> Hopefully, everybody else

685
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,708
is doing the same thing
and voting for you.

686
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,518
>> You always
treated me with kindness.

687
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,020
Um, this is totally strategic,
because I'd hate

688
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,106
to go up against you.
You're too much

689
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,191
of a kind person
and I know they'd just

690
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,485
hand you the money and I can't
and I can't have that happen.

691
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:12,701
Adios.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

692
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:22,795
votes.
Once the votes are read,

693
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:28,217
votes.
Once the votes are read,

694
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,553
the decision is final.
The person voted out

695
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,304
will be asked
to leave the Tribal Council

696
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,975
area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

697
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:43,732
First vote...
Christa.

698
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,026
Lill.
One vote Lill,

699
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:51,157
one vote Christa.
Lill.

700
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,370
That's two votes Lill,
one vote Christa.

701
00:40:56,453 --> 00:41:05,921
Christa.
Christa.

702
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:11,218
Three votes Christa,
two votes Lill.

703
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,721
11th person
voted out of the tribe.

704
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,474
Christa.
You need to bring me your torch.

705
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:36,577
Christa, the tribe has spoken.
You guys told me you trusted

706
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,582
Christa, the tribe has spoken.
You guys told me you trusted

707
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,294
your relationships, and yet,
on the heels of Rupert and T.,

708
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:50,049
a third surprising vote
with only six days left and five

709
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,135
very clearly skilled liars
still in it.

710
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:57,056
Should be a fun finish.
You guys can get your torches.

711
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,100
Head back to camp.

<i>Survivor:</i>
The guys are feeling cocky.

717
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,040
>> I don't think they could
come up with a decent strategy

718
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,792
if they had to.
We definitely have

719
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,961
an intellectual advantage.
>> PROBST: The girls are getting

720
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,921
fed up.
>> The sooner we get rid of

721
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,674
these jackasses, the better.
>> PROBST: And it all comes to

722
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,176
a head.
>> I swear on my grandmother.

723
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,012
I swear, I swear, I swear.
Now, do you guys have a plan

724
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:43,477
or not?
>> I wasn't quite expecting

725
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,231
to get voted off tonight.
It's really surprising to see

726
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,984
how everybody out here
fooled me

727
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,653
at every moment
of this entire game,

728
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,905
but I've made
really great friends.

729
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,992
Sandra and Rupert, both of them
have kept me happy

730
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,661
this whole entire time.
It's been

731
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,746
an adventure of a lifetime.
