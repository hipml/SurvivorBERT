1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:05,797
(SCREAMS) WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,966
OH MY... I CAN SEE MY BONES

3
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:26,276
THE TRIBAL MOLLY WENT HOME AND
JASON STAYED. YEAH!

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,154
THIS PROVED TO ME THAT MY TRIBE
WOULD PLAY WITH ME, BUT JACK AND

5
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:35,243
JAMAL WILL BE ANGRIMENT IT STILL
WAS A TOTAL BLIND SIDE.

6
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:42,500
>> DO YOU GUYS WANT TO TALK?

7
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:50,675
ANYBODY?

8
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,301
>> I'LL GO WITH YOU.

9
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,135
>> WOW.

10
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,262
I WAS BLIND SIDED.

11
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,682
I CLEARLY WAS NOT A PART OF THE
VOTE, HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS

12
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,266
ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

13
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,851
THIS WAS AN EYE-OPENER.

14
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,354
I KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO
DO.

15
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,983
WHERE AM I AT WITH THE GROUP?

16
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:11,112
>> IT WASN'T NECESSARILY JACK,
HE'S GOING TO WIN THIS GAME OR

17
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,656
JAMAL HE'S GOING TO WIN THIS
GAME, THEY'RE THREATS.

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,325
IT WAS THEY WERE PETRIFIED OF
MOLLY.

19
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,328
>> THAT MAKE SENSE.

20
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,996
I WAS JUST SURPRISED.

21
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,832
LIKE IT'S THE GAME "SURVIVOR."

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,709
>> ARE YOU SMILING?

23
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,376
>> YEAH.

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,170
I MEAN, THAT WAS JUST AMAZING.

25
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,340
I REALLY TRULY DO WANT TO
REBUILD THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

26
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:34,511
JAMAL AND JACK, BUT JAMAL IS
MUCH HARDER THAN JACK.

27
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,347
YOU DO HIM WRONG ONCE, HE'S
NEVER GOING THE COME BACK TO

28
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,350
YOU, SO NOW I HAVE TO DO DAMAGE
CONTROL WITH JAMAL.

29
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,895
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

30
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:50,693
WE CAN'T LOSE YOU TWO, BECAUSE
WHERE WOULD WE BE?

31
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,531
>> IT IS HER FAULT THEY WASN'T
INCLUDED, SO I AM THE WILD CARD

32
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,033
NOW.

33
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:57,325
>> WOW.

34
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,536
>> YEP.

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,329
>> I'M IN THE HAPPY THAT THIS
HAPPENED.

36
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:05,041
IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.

37
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,334
SO FORGIVE.

38
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:06,835
DON'T FORGET.

39
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,669
I FORGIVE THE TRIBE.

40
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,546
I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING
FROM.

41
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,129
COOL.

42
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:24,018
NOT GOING TO FORGET IT.

43
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,562
>> YOU A MORNING PERSON?

44
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,021
DO YOU LIKE MORNINGS?

45
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,064
>> NO, I HATE THE MORNINGS.

46
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,357
>> IS THAT RIGHT?

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,400
>> ALL THE GIRL GOSS?

48
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,736
>> ONE, TWO, THREE.

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,448
THE WOMEN HAVE A GIRLS'
ALLIANCE.

50
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,200
IT'S WHEN ALL THE GIRLS GET
TOGETHER.

51
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:44,414
ON THE OUTSIDE IT SEEMS LIKE A
BONDING EXPERIENCE.

52
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,124
>> INAPPROPRIATE.

53
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,501
>> BUT FOR ME IT'S ALL AN ACT.

54
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,545
THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME.

55
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,757
I'M IN MY UNDERWEAR, WHICH I'M
CONSERVATIVE BY NATURE.

56
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,759
WE DON'T SHOW OUR BODIES AS
MUCH.

57
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,011
WE COVER UP.

58
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,599
I'M HERE REPRESENTING AN ENTIRE
COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE, AND I DON'T

59
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,936
KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
FEEL ABOUT A 37-YEAR-OLD MARRIED

60
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,274
INDIAN WOMAN RUNNING AROUND IN
HER UNDERWEAR.

61
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,277
BUT I HAVE TO MAKE THE GIRLS
FEEL AS THOUGH I FEEL STRONG

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,490
ABOUT OUR ALLIANCE AND THAT
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS THAT

63
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:24,662
AND IF THAT MEANS BEING IN MY
UNDERWEAR, SO BE IT.

64
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,622
>> OH, MY GOD.

65
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:31,961
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?

66
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:36,257
>> CLEARLY THE GIRLS ARE REALLY
COMING TOGETHER AND REALLY

67
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,425
BONDING.

68
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,011
THAT WORRIES ME, BECAUSE THERE
ARE FOUR GUY, THERE ARE FIVE

69
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,304
GIRLS.

70
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,513
THEY CAN EASILY GET TOGETHER AND
SAY, WE CAN JUST PICK THESE GUYS

71
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,475
OFF ONE AT A TIME, WHAT DO WE
NEED THEM FOR, SO WE NEED TO

72
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,436
MAKE SURE THAT TRIBAL DYNAMIC
DOES NOT HAPPEN.

73
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,980
>> HERE'S THE THING, THOUGH.

74
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,608
IF WE'RE GOING TO SIT HERE AND
TALK AS FOUR GUYS, WE HAVE TO

75
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,610
MAKE SURE IT STAYS WITH US,
RIGHT?

76
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,320
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL WORKING WITH
US?

77
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,529
>> I'M DOWN.

78
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,238
TOTALLY.

79
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:04,035
>> IF THEY BRING YOU AN IDEA...

80
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,662
>> THEY CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

81
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,538
AT THE END OF THE GUY, THEY HAVE
NUMBERS.

82
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,290
THE GUYS NEVER TALK STRATEGY
WITH ME.

83
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,002
NOW WE'RE DOWN IN NUMBERS AND
SUDDENLY I'M A BRO.

84
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,670
Y'ALL ARE STUPID.

85
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,797
I KNOW THAT AARON WANTED ME OUT.

86
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,632
SO I CAN'T TRUST HIM.

87
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,511
AT THIS POINT I'M LIKE, YO, I AM
GOING TO WORK WITH Y'ALL IF JULY

88
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,512
Y'ALL WANT ME TO.

89
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,556
IF THE LADIES HAVE CONTROL OF
THE GAME, WONDERFUL.

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:32,438
I'LL WORK WITH THE WOMEN.

91
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,992
>> I THINK AFTER LAST NIGHT'S
TRIBAL IT WAS CLEAR THAT JACK

92
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,076
AND JAMAL WERE NAIVE.

93
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,537
I LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN NAIVE
PLAYERS.

94
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,539
>> THERE WE GO.

95
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,874
>> BUT IT'S A FRESH START TODAY.

96
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,919
I THINK MY STRATEGY MOVING
FORWARD IS WIN-WIN.

97
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,380
I WANT IT TO BE A WIN FOR THE
TRIBE AND A WIN FOR ME.

98
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,591
>> YOU DON'T NEED THE MAGNESIUM,
GUYS, JUST A LITTLE HINT.

99
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:06,180
>> THE WIN FOR ME AND THE
BIGGEST WIN FOR THE TRIBE FOR

100
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,391
NEXT VOTE IS NOURA.

101
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,601
OBVIOUSLY JACK AND JAMAL COULD
BE OKAY WITH IT.

102
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:16,190
>> HOW ABOUT EVERY TIME SOMEONE
GOES DOWN THE PATH, THEY BRING

103
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,400
BACK WOOD.

104
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,236
>> IT WOULD BE STATISTICALLY
IMPROBABLE TO GET ON EVERYBODY'S

105
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,283
NERVES, AND SHE'S ACCOMPLISHED
THAT.

106
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:30,246
>> I'M GOING THE LEAD PEOPLE TO
A DECISION THAT IS BEST FOR THEM

107
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:30,997
THAT HAPPENS TO BE GOOD FOR ME.

108
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,168
RIGHT NOW, NEXT VOTE, FIVE
PEOPLE.

109
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,627
IF FIVE PEOPLE WANT TO DO
SOMETHING AND HAVE COMMITTED TO

110
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,587
IT, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

111
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,589
THE QUESTION IS WHO GOES HOME.

112
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,423
>> OKAY.

113
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,591
>> WHO ARE YOU THINKING?

114
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:46,971
>> I THINK WE CAN GO 8-1 ON
NOURA AND NOW ONE IS UPSET.

115
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,640
>> NOURA IS AN EASY VOTE.

116
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,269
I THINK IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE
NOURA IS THE ONE PERSON THAT

117
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,606
WILL MAYBE NOT STAY WITH OUR
TRIBE.

118
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:01,944
>> NOURA IS OUR PLAN.

119
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,572
>> I THINK EVERYONE IS VERY
EXCITED ABOUT GETTING RID OF

120
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,618
NOURA, AND IF WE HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT GOING THE TRIBAL HAVING TO

121
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,622
SEE A NICE EASY UNIFYING VOTE,
BUT AS SOMEONE WHO FEELS ON THE

122
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:18,461
OUTS, I 100% RESERVE EVERY RIGHT
TO GO ROGUE AND DO WHATEVER THE

123
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,796
HELL I THINK IS BEST FOR ME.

124
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,131
I JUST FEEL LIKE I WANT TO HAVE
AGENCY.

125
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:27,136
I WANT MY MOVES TO BE MINE AND
TAKE BACK CONTROL OF THIS GAME.

126
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,473
IT'S LIKE I NEED TO SEE IT
BEFORE I BELIEVE IT NOW.

127
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,682
THERE'S A LOT OF SCEPTICISM.

128
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,310
I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE --
>> IT'S NOURA.

129
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,978
>> EXACTLY.

130
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:41,442
>> DAN HAS THAT QUICK-TALKING
USED CAR SALESMAN VIBE TO HIM

131
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,363
THAT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL ICKY
WHEN HE'S TRYING TO GET YOU TO

132
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,531
DO SOMETHING.

133
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,951
SO RIGHT NOW I'M THINKING THAT I
COULD POSSIBLY MAKE A MOVE

134
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,160
AGAINST DAN.

135
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:56,874
>> OKAY, HERE'S MY PITCH, YOU
HAVE EXPRESSED A LITTLE BIT OF

136
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,042
DISCOMFORT, WARINESS OF DAN.

137
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,504
I THINK YOU'VE SAID THAT IN THE
PAST.

138
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,548
I'M STARTING TO GET VERY
SQUIRRELY ABOUT DAN.

139
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:11,848
I THINK HE'S TOO QUICK TALKING,
TOO KIND OF BE GARTING --

140
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,349
BOGARTING WITH HIS WORDS.

141
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:16,477
I DON'T THINK HE'LL HAVE MY BEST
INTERESTS AT HEART.

142
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,355
>> JAMAL MADE A VALID POINT.

143
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,232
HOW ABOUT I TALK TO TOMMY, TOO?

144
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:21,899
>> YEAH.

145
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,527
>> I MEAN, DAN IS A SUIT.

146
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,320
HE KNOWS THE GAME.

147
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:32,034
AND HE'S TOO BIG OF A PRESENCE.

148
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,036
DAN IS NOT A BAD MOVE.

149
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,829
WOULD YOU VOTE DAN?

150
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,332
>> THIS IS A POWER MOVE FOR
JAMAL.

151
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,209
ARE WE DOING IT FOR US OR JAMAL?

152
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,255
I LOVE JAMAL.

153
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,089
>> I DO, TOO.

154
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,717
>> JAMAL IS COMING ON WAY TOO
STRONG.

155
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,223
>> SAY WE DON'T GO WITH THIS, DO
WE CONSIDER JAMAL?

156
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,185
>> I HAVE THE KEEP THINKING,
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME IN THE LONG

157
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,436
RUN?

158
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,858
JAMAL IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, SO
MAYBE JAMAL IS THE BEST VOTE FOR

159
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,236
MY GAME.

160
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,405
>> LET'S GET THAT SUCKER IN
THERE.

161
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:16,913
LET'S GO.

162
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,247
>> ALL RIGHT.

163
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,290
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO SEE.

164
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,791
>> GO SEE THE DOCTOR.

165
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,043
>> OH, MY.

166
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,711
I CAN SEE MY BONE.

167
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,087
YEP, YEP, YEP.

168
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,923
I CAN SEE MY BONE.

169
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:31,093
YEP, I CAN SEE MY BONE.

170
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,262
GUYS, I'M GETTING REALLY
LIGHT-HEADED.

171
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:38,226
GUYS, I'M GETTING REALLY
LIGHT-HEADED.

172
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,771
TODAY I GO STAB MY HAND RIGHT
THROUGH TO THE BONE.

173
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,441
SO I GOT DOWN ON MY HANDS AND
KNEES AN I PUT MY HEAD DOWN TO

174
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,817
MAKE SURE I DIDN'T FAINT OR HURT
MYSELF ANYMORE.

175
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:54,742
AND THEN THE BLOOD STARTED
OOZING AND BUBBLING OUT, AND I

176
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,286
COULD HEAR CONVERSATIONS BEHIND
ME.

177
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,454
NOBODY CAME TO ME.

178
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,332
I'M ON THE GROUND.

179
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,417
NOT 15 FEET AWAY.

180
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,421
>> YEAH, BABY.

181
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,967
ANYONE ELSE, EVERYBODY WOULD
HAVE RUSHED TO THEM.

182
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,096
I THINK PEOPLE JUST DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME.

183
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,849
I DON'T THINK THAT IT HURTS
ANYONE'S GAME TO SHOW SOME

184
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,433
HUMANITY.

185
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,144
THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL.

186
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,020
LET'S BE REAL.

187
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,106
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT I WAS
BLEEDING.

188
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,817
>> NO BIG DEAL, JUST SIT DOWN.

189
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,819
>> YOU CAN TELL WHEN PEOPLE
DON'T WANT THE PLAY WITH YOU BY

190
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,280
THE WAY THEY TREAT YOU AT CAMP.

191
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,532
IF I WOULD HAVE CHOPPED MY HEAD
OFF, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE

192
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,574
FLINCHED.

193
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,618
EACH AND EVERY PERSON ON THIS
TRIBE IS DEAD TO ME.

194
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,719
HELLO!

195
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,803
>> OH, SOMEBODY IS YELLING.

196
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,472
>> OH.

197
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,183
>> WE'RE BEING SUMMONED.

198
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,685
>> OH, IT'S A NOTE.

199
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,812
OH, MY GOD, IT'S A NOTE.

200
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,439
THANK YOU.

201
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,816
>> OUCH.

202
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,694
>> BREATHE TOGETHER AS A TRIBE.

203
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,239
VINCE MUST GET ON THE BOAT AND
HEADED TO ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

204
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,743
HE WILL RETURN TO CAMP TOMORROW
MORNING.

205
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,661
>> HOW DID I GET CHOSEN?

206
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:25,374
>> AT THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS, I
DID HAVE CHANCE TO WIN AN IDOL,

207
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,586
BUT I LOST THAT CHANCE, BUT I DO
KNOW IT'S A POSSIBILITY TO WIN

208
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,086
AN IDOL THERE.

209
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,215
>> BYE, VINCE.

210
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,719
>> SO ODDS ARE VINCE COMES BACK
WITH AN IDOL, AND WE NEED TO

211
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,803
FLUSH IT.

212
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,222
>> HE'S GOING TO GO THERE AND
PROBABLY GET AN IDOL.

213
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:45,603
>> SAY HE COMES BACK TOMORROW,
DO WE TRY THE FLUSH IT RIGHT

214
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,228
AWAY?

215
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,899
THEN WE JUST SPLIT THE VOTE.

216
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,693
>> AGREED.

217
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,694
>> HUH?

218
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,571
HUH?

219
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:59,742
>> AFTER VINCE LEFT, WE ALL
LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THE

220
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:05,081
DUMB-DUMB I WAS, I OPENED MY
MOUTH AS ANY "SURVIVOR" WOULD

221
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,709
DO, SPLIT THE VOTE, THAT'S SMART
THING TO DO, BECAUSE IF YOU'RE

222
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,921
SPLITTING THE VOTE, ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE IS THE ONE YOU'RE

223
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,172
SPLITTING IT AGAINST.

224
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:19,220
WAS EVERYBODY THINKING IT, YES,
DID IT NEED TO BE VERBALIZED,

225
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,012
YES?

226
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,722
DEAN BLURTS, OH, WE SPLIT THE
VOTE.

227
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,642
I KNEW IN THAT MOMENT, 100%,
IT'S ME.

228
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:32,483
IF VINCE COMES BACK WITH AN
IDOL, I'M GONE.

229
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:36,445
>> UP UNTIL NOW I HAVE NOT BEEN
PUT IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

230
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,449
I AM SUPER WORRIED THAT PEOPLE
WILL START FORMULATING PLANS TO

231
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,451
GO AGAINST ME.

232
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:49,583
BUT THIS IS WHAT "SURVIVOR" GODS
GIVE YOU.

233
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,836
>> WHOA.

234
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,174
MAYBE IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY
TO CHANGE MY GAME.

235
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,801
>> WELCOME.

236
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,302
>> NO WAY.

237
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,971
>> COME AND GIVE ME A HUG.

238
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:02,388
>> OH.

239
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,139
>> HOW ARE YOU?

240
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:08,102
>> OUT POPS BOSTON ROB AND
SANDRA.

241
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,646
I'M JUST LIKE, WHAT IS GOING ON.

242
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,647
>> COME ON, BROTHER.

243
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,648
>> YOU'RE IN SHOCK?

244
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,941
>> YEAH, I AM.

245
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:18,279
I DON'T GET STAR STRUCK VERY
EASILY, I DON'T, BUT YOU TWO ARE

246
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,321
AMAZING PLAYERS.

247
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,782
SANDRA IS A POWERFUL WOMAN OF
COLOR WHO WON TWICE.

248
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,451
I HAD TO PULL MYSELF TOGETHER.

249
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,203
I WAS LIKE, OH, BOY.

250
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,457
>> WHERE YOU FROM, MAN?

251
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,249
>> I'M, SORRY.

252
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:37,173
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
FROM?

253
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,009
>> I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU TWO.

254
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,219
SO THE SEE YOU IN REAL LIFE.

255
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:48,976
>> VINCE WAS INSTANTLY OVERCOME
WITH EMOTION.

256
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,021
IT'S LIKE A HUMBLING FEELING TO
KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE

257
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,858
JUST DOING THE SHOW AND IT'S HAD
SUCH A BIG IMPACT ON THIS GUY'S

258
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,317
LIFE.

259
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,236
>> SORRY, SORRY.

260
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,034
>> IT'S AWESOME.

261
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:10,206
>> MAYBE A LITTLE AWKWARD TO SEE
A GROWN MAN CRY, BUT I'M HOPING

262
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,210
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO REALIZE
JUST HOW INFLUENTIAL YOU CAN BE

263
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,922
IN A GAME LIKE THIS.

264
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,048
>> ALL RIGHT, VINCE.

265
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,051
LET ME SEE IF I CAN TELL YOU HOW
IT'S GOING TO WORK.

266
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,262
EVERYBODY THAT COMES TO THE
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS GETS A

267
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:25,554
LESSON.

268
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,764
>> OKAY.

269
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:32,228
>> AN YOUR LESSON TODAY IS ABOUT
STAYING CALM UNDER PRESSURE.

270
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,398
"SURVIVOR" IS FULL OF SITUATIONS
WHERE YOU ENCOUNTER TONS OF

271
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,566
PRESSURE.

272
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,403
YOU KNOW, YOUR EMOTIONS HAVE TO
BE IN CHECK IN THIS GAME.

273
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:46,408
SO FOR YOUR TEST, TONIGHT YOU
MUST SNEAK INTO THE OTHER

274
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:51,038
TRIBE'S CAMP AND STEAL FIRE BY
LIGHTING THIS TORCH.

275
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:54,083
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET SO
CLOSE TO THEM IT'S A BIG-TIME

276
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,334
RISK.

277
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,962
IF THEY DON'T HAVE FIRE, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

278
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,422
TO BRING US PROOF SOMEHOW.

279
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,260
IF YOU RETURN WITH FIRE AND
WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT, YOU EARN

280
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,472
AN IMMUNITY IDOL GOOD FOR YOUR
NEXT TWO TRIBAL COUNCILS.

281
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:13,185
IF YOU GET CAUGHT, YOU LOSE YOUR
VOTE FOR THE NEXT TRIBAL

282
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,395
COUNCIL.

283
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,648
THE QUESTION IS, DO YOU HAVE THE
CONFIDENCE TO ATTEMPT SUCH A

284
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:22,278
DARING FEAT, OR WILL YOU PLAY IT
SAFE AND PASS UP THIS SHOT AT AN

285
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,320
ADVANTAGE?

286
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,907
>> I FEEL LIKE THIS IS REALLY AN
IMPOSSIBLE MISSION.

287
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,159
IT DOES SCARE ME A LOT TO THINK
ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO GO

288
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:34,873
DOWN, BUT THIS MAY BE MY ONLY
OPPORTUNITY TO GET AN IMMUNITY

289
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,001
IDOL AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME.

290
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,921
>> I WOULD JUST RISK IT AND DO
IT.

291
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,006
I'LL TAKE THE TEST, YEAH.

292
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,799
>> ALL RIGHT.

293
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:44,800
LET'S GET TO WORK.

294
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:47,428
I GOT MAP OF THE OTHER TRIBE'S
CAMP.

295
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,015
>> UH-HUH.

296
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,810
YOU'RE GOING TO GET DROPPED
SOMEWHERE OVER HERE ON THE

297
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:55,728
BEACH.

298
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,187
THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO APPROACH
THEIR CAMP.

299
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,314
IT COMES WITH A FLAG.

300
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,276
YOU CAN COME THIS WAY OR YOU CAN
COME THROUGH THE BACK.

301
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,987
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR BEST
BET, BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO BE

302
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,155
SUCCESSFUL.

303
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,326
WHAT YOU SEE ON MAP IS SMALL
SCALE COMPARED THE WHAT YOU

304
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,119
ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO.

305
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,162
IT'S LATE AT NIGHT.

306
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,663
IN TOTAL DARKNESS.

307
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,459
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE AREA, THE
TERRAIN WHERE HE HAS TO GO.

308
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,378
HE MAY HAVE TO LOW CRAWL.

309
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,381
HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T, BUT I'M
GOING THE TEACH YOU HOW TO LOW

310
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,633
CRAWL.

311
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,217
THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE HARD,
BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM ALL MY

312
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,469
FIVE YEARS OF MILITARY TRAINING.

313
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:33,974
>> THE OTHER THING IS, WITH THIS
TORCH, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

314
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:38,145
APPROACH IT LOW AND ALMOST
PARALLEL TO THE GROUND.

315
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:43,150
"ISLAND OF THE IDOLS" IS LIKE A
SURVIVOR-STYLE BOOTCAMP.

316
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,194
USE YOUR PERIPHERAL VISION.

317
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,237
BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS.

318
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,198
BUT IN VINCE'S PARTICULAR
SITUATION, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A

319
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,160
ACTUAL BOOTCAMP.

320
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,328
>> LOOK DOWN.

321
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,082
>> WE'RE TEACHING VINCE HOW THE
STAY CALM UNDER PRESSURE.

322
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:58,999
APPROACH THE FIRE.

323
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,125
>> YOU GO IN.

324
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,171
>> SANDRA IS TAKING IT A COUPLE
STEPS TOO FAR, AS USUAL.

325
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,215
>> IN MATTER HOW SILLY IT MAY
LOOK.

326
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,594
YOU NEED THE MAKE IT HAPPEN.

327
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,013
GOING INTO THE OTHER TRIBE'S
CAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

328
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,059
WITHOUT GETTING SEEN AND
STEALING FIRE WHEN ONE PERSON ON

329
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,104
THEIR TRIBE IS SURE TO BE AWAKE
IS MORE THAN DIFFICULT.

330
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,231
GOOD LUCK, VINCE.

331
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,858
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

332
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,526
THERE'S STILL NINE PEOPLE LEFT
IN THE TRIBE.

333
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,277
>> I WISH I COULD GO WITH HIM.

334
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,655
>> AND DO WHAT?

335
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,742
>> HELP HIM ALONG THE WAY, I
DON'T KNOW.

336
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,160
YOU'LL MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE IN
THE BUSH.

337
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,206
>> YOU'RE CRAZY.

338
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:50,217
I'M STEALTH MODE.

339
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,305
>> WHEN I GOT TO VOKAI, IT'S
PITCH BLACK.

340
00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,269
IT'S IS DARK OUT HERE, I CAN
BARELY SEE ANYTHING.

341
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,606
RAIN IS COMING DOWN.

342
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,111
MY SHOES ARE MAKING SOUNDS A
BIT.

343
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,449
AND I SEE THERE IS A STRUCTURE
SOMEWHAT.

344
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:18,495
AT THIS POINT I'M LIKE, I'M
HERE.

345
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,332
MY HEART IS BEATING LIKE CRAZY,
AN I'M HOPING THAT NO ONE WAKES

346
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:36,847
UP, BECAUSE IF THEY DO, THEN I'M
SCREWED.

347
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,141
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

348
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:51,612
>> WHAT'S WRONG?

349
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,321
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

350
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,322
>> BAD DREAM.

351
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,284
>> SORRY.

352
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,288
>> IF I GO IN THERE AND THEIR
FIRE IS DEAD.

353
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,373
THEY AIN'T GOT NOTHING AT ALL.

354
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,627
I REALIZE THEY'RE A BUNCH OF
DUMMIES ON THE OTHER SIDE AND

355
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,837
THEY DON'T KEEP THEIR FIRE DRY.

356
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,381
SO THE BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR ME
TO COLLECT AS MUCH ASH AS

357
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,344
POSSIBLE TO LET SANDRA AND ROB
KNOW THAT I DID MY BEST WITH

358
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,513
WHAT I WAS GIVEN.

359
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,597
I ADAPTED.

360
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:42,996
I UNSKEW MY WATER BOTTLE AND I'M
JUST LIKE SHOVELING COLE INTO MY

361
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:54,508
CANISTER.

362
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,554
AND WHEN THAT IS DONE, I JUST
BUST OUT OF THERE.

363
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,683
I'M JUST LITTLE BITTY OLD VINCE
WITH NINJA SKILLS.

364
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:07,229
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.

365
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,441
[LAUGHING]
I'M PRETTY SURE TOM CRUISE

366
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:19,783
COULDN'T HANDLE THIS.

367
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,744
I WAS CALM UNDER PRESSURE AND I
STILL WAS ABLE TO SNEAK IN AND

368
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,415
GET REMNANTS OF WHAT WE HAD
INITIALLY PLANNED TO GET.

369
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:35,757
AND I'M HOPING THEY WILL SEE
THAT I HAVE PUT IN ALL THE WORK.

370
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,259
>> ALL RIGHT, VINCE.

371
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,428
THE LESSON WAS TO REMAIN CALM
UNDER PRESSURE.

372
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,932
YOU PHYSICALLY WENT TO THEIR
FIRE, AND IT WAS OUT.

373
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,434
>> IT WAS OUT.

374
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,602
FEW BUT YOU GOT ASHES?

375
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,102
>> I DID.

376
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,729
>> SANDRA, IT'S CLOSE.

377
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,479
>> HE DIDN'T GET CAUGHT.

378
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,940
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT THAT IT
RAINED.

379
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,442
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT THAT THE FIRE
WAS OUT.

380
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,154
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT
THIS?

381
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,323
YOU ADAPTED IN THE FACE OF
ADVERSITY.

382
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,326
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO CALL THIS
A WIN.

383
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:08,749
>> YES!

384
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,167
>> IMMUNITY.

385
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,001
YOU EARNED IT.

386
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,878
>> IT'S CRAZY TO HAVE THIS IN MY
HAND.

387
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,922
THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE DREAMS OF
GETTING.

388
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,549
THIS IDOL IS ONLY GOOD FOR THE
NEXT TWO TRIBAL COUNCILS.

389
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:22,804
SO I JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
I USE IT APPROPRIATELY.

390
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,556
BUT THIS IS WONDERFUL TO HAVE
POWER IN THE GAME.

391
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,917
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

392
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,670
FIRST THINGS FIRST, I'VE GOT THE
TAKE IT BACK.

393
00:20:54,753 --> 00:21:00,509
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

394
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,970
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, ONE
PERSON FROM EACH TRIBE IS GOING

395
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,180
TO SWIM OUT TO RETRIEVE A KEY.

396
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,392
THE REST OF THE TRIBE WILL THEN
DIVE IN AND CLIMB UP ON TO A

397
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:12,354
TEETER TOTTER WHERE YOU MUST
BALANCE AS A GROUP WHILE

398
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,400
RETRIEVING TWO BAGS OF PUZZLE
PIECES.

399
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:21,113
YOU'LL THEN USE THE KEY TO
UNLOCK THE LAST SET OF KEYS.

400
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,033
FIRST TRIBE TO SOLVE THEIR
PUZZLE WINS IMMUNITY.

401
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,371
IN ADDITION YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD IN THE FORM OF COMFORT.

402
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,039
>> OH, MY GOD.

403
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,708
JUST WHAT WE NEED.

404
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:41,717
>> Jeff: CUSHIONS, BLANKETS,
CHAIRS, A HAMMOCK.

405
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,551
>> KEEP GOING.

406
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,511
>> Jeff: AND A TARP.

407
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,721
[APPLAUSE]
>> YES!

408
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,391
>> Jeff: LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE THIRD

409
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,353
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

410
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:59,651
I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE, AND WE'LL GET IT ON.

411
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,360
ALL RIGHT.

412
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,570
HERE WE GO.

413
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:07,451
WE HAVE ELIZABETH SWIMMING FOR
LAIRO, JANET SWIMMING FOR VOKAI.

414
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,746
FOR IMMUNITY AND REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY?

415
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,249
GO!

416
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,419
IT'S ELIZABETH AND JANET IN THE
WATER IN THE SHOWDOWN ROLE.

417
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,920
>> YES, JANET.

418
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,796
>> Jeff: WOW.

419
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,093
BOTH WOMEN ARE RIPPING THROUGH
THE WATER.

420
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:30,432
ELIZABETH WITH A LEAD, BUT JANET
IS STAYING RIGHT THERE.

421
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,768
>> YOU GOT IT, JANET.

422
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,644
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH IS GOING TO
GET HERE FIRST.

423
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:42,069
YOU'VE GOT THE DIVE DOWN NOW AND
UNTIE THAT BUOY.

424
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,946
JANET IS AT HER NET.

425
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,906
SHE DIVES DOWN.

426
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,948
>> GOOD JOB.

427
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,408
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH IS UP.

428
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:55,332
AN SHE'S GOT THE KEY THAT WILL
OPEN UP AN EARLY LEAD FOR LAIRO.

429
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,083
YOU'RE GOOD.

430
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,796
GO, LAIRO.

431
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,632
>> Jeff: JANET STILL
UNDERWATER NOW.

432
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,008
>> HERE WE GO, JANET.

433
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,927
>> WE GOT THIS, JANET.

434
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,097
>> Jeff: JANET BACK NOW,
GIVING LAIRO A BIG LEAD.

435
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,642
NOW YOU GOT TO GET EVERYBODY UP
ON THE TEETER TOTTER.

436
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:20,273
THE LAST PERSON UP IS THE PERSON
WHO MUST RETRIEVE THE BAG.

437
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,691
JANET IS GOING TO GO TO THE MAPS
NOW.

438
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,527
THIS IS A HUGE SETBACK.

439
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,197
>> OH, MY GOD.

440
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,657
>> GO THAT WAY.

441
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,495
>> Jeff: LAIRO NOW CAN TAKE
THEIR TIME TRYING TO DISTRIBUTE

442
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,833
THAT WEIGHT EVENLY ON THE TEETER
TOTTER.

443
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,167
>> COME HERE A LITTLE BIT.

444
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,711
>> THERE GOES MISSY NOW.

445
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,840
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO WORK DOWN
THE BEAM TO RELEASE THAT FIRST

446
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,173
BAG.

447
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,716
>> I'M SAFE.

448
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,511
I'M STABLE.

KICK IT INTO GEAR.

452
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,518
YOU NEVER GIVE UP ON "SURVIVOR."

453
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,478
>> COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

454
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,397
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD, VOKAI.

455
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,356
VOKAI IN THE WATER.

456
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,524
THEY'RE BACK IN IT NOW.

457
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,527
VOKAI IS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
UP A LOT OF TIME AND HAVE TO

458
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:12,033
WORK TOGETHER VERY WELL ON THAT
TEETER TOTTER.

459
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,160
>> TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH.

460
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,703
>> NO, NO, NO.

461
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,415
>> Jeff: NOW YOU HAVE TO
COMMUNICATE.

462
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:22,252
HOW MUCH DO YOU TILT THAT WEIGHT
SO SHE CAN REACH THE BAG.

463
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,545
MISSY IS CLOSE.

464
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,546
>> OKAY.

465
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,256
>> Jeff: YOU HAVE TO GET RIGHT
OUT ON THAT EDGE.

466
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,924
>> TAKE YOUR TIME.

467
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,844
>> SHE'S GOT TO UNTIE IT.

468
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,053
THE MORE TIME SHE TAKES.

469
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,223
THE MORE SHE OPENS THE DOOR FOR
VOKAI, AND THAT ARE QUICKLY

470
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:35,724
GETTING BACK IN THIS.

471
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,393
>> COME ON, BABY GIRL.

472
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,187
>> Jeff: MISSY HAS THE FIRST
BAG.

473
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,064

SHE'S GOING THE LEAVE IT THERE
AND GO FOR THAT SECOND BAG.

475
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,408
WE'VE GOT A CHALLENGE.

476
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,536
VOKAI GETS ON THEIR TEETER
TOTTER VERY FAST.

477
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,622
THEY ARE MAKING UP TIME NOW.

478
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,124
>> WALK OUT A LITTLE BIT.

479
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,627
>> MISSY NOW MAKING HER WAY
TOWARD THAT SECOND BAG.

480
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,255
IT IS NEVER OVER UNTIL IT IS
OVER.

481
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:14,804
AND THIS IS FAR FROM OVER.

482
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,600
>>
>> EVERYBODY ON VOKAI NOW HAS

483
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,392
THE HANG OF IT.

484
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,230

NICE WORK BY MISSY.

490
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,951
>> LITTLE MORE, LITTLE MORE.

491
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,785
A LITTLE MORE.

492
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,827
>> Jeff: GETTING CLOSER.

493
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,912

HE'S HELPING HER.

496
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,666
THAT'S HOW YOU GOT TO DO IT.

497
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,792
YOU GOT TO WORK TOGETHER.

498
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,629

00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,680
KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND
TAKE YOUR TIME.

503

>> Jeff: MISSY HAS HER SECOND
BAG.

00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,476
>> EVERYBODY JUMPS.

505
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,812
THEY STILL HAVE ONE BAG IN THE
WATER.

506
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,981
AARON IS GOING THAT.

507
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,358

THEY'RE BUILDING A FISH.

514
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,373
THERE ARE FOUR FINS.

515
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:27,836
FINS WILL GO IN LAST.

516
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,712
KELLEE STRETCHED OUT.

517
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,504
SHE DOES IT.

518
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:33,675
GET IN.

519
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,843
>> THE OTHER WAY?

520
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:39,222
>> Jeff: LAIRO HAS HAD A BIG
LEAD, BUT THERE IS A STALEMATE

521
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,056
RIGHT NOW.

522
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:45,020
NO PROGRESS BEING MADE.

523
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:45,895
VOKAI, YOU'RE GOOD.

524
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,398
START WORKING ON THE PUZZLE.

525
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,526
WE HAVE LAUREN AND JAMAL FOR
VOKAI.

526
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,696
>> RIGHT THERE.

527
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,698
>> Jeff: AFTER ALL OF THAT
EFFORT, WE ARE DEAD EVEN NOW.

528
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,575
>> BOTTOM.

529
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,868
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

530
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:05,665
>> Jeff: DEAN WITH FIRST PIECE
FOR LAIRO.

531
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:05,957
>> OH, YES.

532
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:06,750
>> YES.

533
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,836
>> JAMAL WITH FIRST PIECE FOR
VOKAI.

534
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,670
>> THERE WE GO.

535
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,673
>> LAUREN WITH ANOTHER PIECE FOR
VOKAI.

536
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,552
ONCE YOU START FIGURING IT OUT,
YOU'LL GET A RHYTHM GOING.

537
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,971
PIECES ARE GOING THE START
JUMPING AT YOU AS THEY ARE FOR

538
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,097
VOKAI.

539
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:25,060
JAMAL WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

540
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,895
>> LOOK AT THE COLOR SCREAM.

541
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,065
RED ON THE RIGHT, GREEN GOES ON
THE LEFT.

542
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,733
COME ON.

543
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,943
>> Jeff: ANOTHER PIECE BY
VOKAI.

544
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,781
THEY WERE SO FAR BEHIND, IT
ALMOST LOOKED LIKE IT WASN'T

545
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:42,952
GOING THE HAPPEN, AND NOW THEY
ARE IN THE ALITO.

546
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:47,207
>> TURN IT THE OTHER WAY, TURN
IT THE OTHER WAY.

547
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,918
>> Jeff: KARISHMA AND DEAN
FEELING ENORMOUS PRESSURE AS

548
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,004
THEY HAVE BUT ONE PIECE ON THEIR
PUZZLE.

549
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,798
>> RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE?

550
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,257
>> IS THIS IT?

551
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,425
IS THIS IT, GUYS?

552
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,053
>> Jeff: DEAN AND KARISHMA
WITH ANOTHER PIECE, BUT THEY ARE

553
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,721
STILL FAR BEHIND.

554
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,266
VOKAI KICKING IT INTO ANOTHER
GEAR.

555
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,975
THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE.

556
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,020
YOU HAVE TO GET IT TOCTS, LAIRO.

557
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,399
>> JAMAL WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

558
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,943
DOWN TO THEIR FIN.

559
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,946
LAIRO IS DEAD IN THE WATER.

560
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,614
>> JEFF!

561
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:20,573
JEFF!

562
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,117
>> Jeff: VOKAI VERY CLOSE NOW.

563
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,159
>> JEFF!

564
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,369
>> Jeff: VOKAI HAS IT.

565
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:33,962
VOKAI WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD
SENDING LAIRO BACK THE TRIBAL

566
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,797
COUNCIL.

567
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,132
VOKAI, CONGRATULATIONS.

568
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,675
IMMUNITY GOES BACK THE YOUR
TRIBE.

569
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,344
YOUR REWARD IN THE FORM OF
COMFORT WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU

570
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:41,970
BACK AT CAMP.

571
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,179
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

572
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,013
HEAD DOWN THE STEPS.

573
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:53,189
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

574
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,191
LAIRO, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE THIRD

575
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,652
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THE GAME.

576
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:58,653
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

577
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:02,031
>> I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING
RIGHT NOW IS WHERE THE

578
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,366
BOTTLENECK IS WITH THIS TRIBE.

579
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,536
IT COMES DOWN TO OUR ABILITY TO
DO PUZZLES.

580
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,664
TODAY WE ABSOLUTELY BLEW IT.

581
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:12,500
UNFORTUNATELY KARISHMA SHOT
HERSELF IN THE FOOT, BUT BY

582
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,254
VINCE GOING TO THE ISLAND OF THE
IDOL, THERE'S A LOT LEFT UNKNOWN

583
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,589
WITH WHAT HAPPENED OVER THERE,
SO FOR US VINCE IS A TOP

584
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,258
PRIORITY TO GO HOME.

585
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,858
>> WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM THE
CHALLENGE, PEOPLE WERE MAD THAT

586
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,358
WE LOST.

587
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,026
WE HAD THE BIG LEAD.

588
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,153
WE SHOULD HAVE WON THAT TODAY.

589
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:45,033
>> SHE DOESN'T DO THE PUZZLE.

590
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,119
>> THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT
GOING ON THAT KARISHMA SCREWED

591
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:52,040
UP IN THE CHALLENGE, BUT BECAUSE
VINCE WAS OFF AT ISLAND OF THE

592
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:56,711
IDOLS AND ALL LIKELIHOOD HAS AN
IDOL, THE TARGET IS ON HIM.

593
00:29:56,794 --> 00:30:00,006
NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
SPLITTING VOTES ASSUMING THAT HE

594
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,049
HAS AN IDOL.

595
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,884
WE HAVE TO GET VINCE, BUT WE'RE
WEARY OF AN IDOL.

596
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,720
>> SO KARISHMA?

597
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,388
HE DOESN'T PLAY HIS IDOL, HE
GOES HOME.

598
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,223
>> PERFECT.

599
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:15,230
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT GOES
RIGHT DOWN.

600
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,191
>> SO THE FOUR BOYS ARE GOING TO
GO KARISHMA.

601
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,778
YOU FIVE GIRLS ARE GOING TO VOTE
VINCE, PLUS THE IDOL?

602
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,029
>> I WANT THE RUN THROUGH THE
NUMBERS.

603
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,240
RIGHT NOW THE GIRLS HAVE THE
MAJORITY.

604
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,075
THE MEN ARE ON THE ROPES.

605
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,246
WHY WOULD WE GO INTO THE PLAN
THAT THE MEN SET UP AND PUT

606
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,039
KARISHMA UP AS A MINORITY VOTE?

607
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,583
VINCE HAS SHOWN FROM DAY ONE
HE'S NOT GOING TO GO TO THE

608
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,585
MEN'S SIDE.

609
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,587
I SAY WE KEEP HIM FOR OUR
NUMBERS.

610
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,092
>> LET'S SAY THERE'S SIX OF US,
FIVE GIRLS PLUS YOU, OF THOSE

611
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,054
GUYS, WHO CAN YOU LOSE AND STILL
BE OKAY?

612
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,266
>> MY THING IS TOM IS A
LIABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO

613
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,893
PHYSICAL ENDURANCE.

614
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,564
TODAY HOMEBOY WAS HUFFING AND
PUFFING.

615
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:02,652
>> AARON AND DEAN ARE STRONG,
YOUNG, ATHLETIC PEOPLE, SO DEDO

616
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,778
WE SHOOT FOR TOM?

617
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:07,031
WITH THE MAJORITY, THERE
WOULDN'T BE MUCH BLOODSHED ON

618
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,199
ANYONE'S HANDS.

619
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,327
SO WE HAVE FIVE GIRLS PLUS
VINCE, I'M DOWN TO GET TOM OUT,

620
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,581
BECAUSE IF WE WRITE TOM, THE
OTHER GIRLS WILL WRITE TOM AN WE

621
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,833
CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

622
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,793
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE TOM GO.

623
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:19,877
HE'S BECOME OUR DAD.

624
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,129
HE'S AN ATHLETE.

625
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,006
WE CONNECT ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL
THAN ALL OF THE OTHER PLAYERS.

626
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,300
AND I BELIEVE ELAINE FEELS THE
SAME, TOO.

627
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,761
WE VOTE OUT VINCE, I THINK
THAT'S OUR EASIEST VOTE.

628
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:35,101
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL BE
MAD AT THAT.

629
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:39,147
>> I AM VERY NERVOUS GOING THE
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

630
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,067
NOT ONLY HAVE I BEEN ON THE OUTS
IN THE TRIBE FOR THE PAST FEW

631
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,778
DAY, BUT I ALSO LOST THE PUZZLE.

632
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,030
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

633
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,783
>> I THINK WE JUST STICK TO THE
GIRLS ALLIANCE AND WE CAN ALL GO

634
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,993
TOM.

635
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,829
>> ONLY NAME PEOPLE ARE WILLING
TO WRITE DOWN ARE KARISHMA.

636
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:56,831
>> MO, THEY'RE NOT, GIRL.

637
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:57,874
YOU HAVE TO PUSH WHAT YOU WANT.

638
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,877
>> WHAT I WANT --
>> YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP SAYING --

639
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,295
>> I WANT PEOPLE THE PLAY THE
GAME.

640
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,005
>> BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP SAYING
THAT.

641
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,675
IF YOU WANT SOMEONE, YOU RIGHT
NOW, IF YOU THINK YOU'RE AT THE

642
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,844
BOTTOM, YOU NEED TO TELL US WHO
YOU WANT OUT.

643
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,972
WHEN YOU PLAY WITH PLAYERS LIKE
KARISHMA WHO DO NOT GIVE YOU

644
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,223
NAME, IT GETS ME SO RILED UP.

645
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:18,394
IT'S LIKE, GIRL, YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO IS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

646
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,021
GIVE US A DAMN NAME.

647
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,190
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

648
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,025
HONESTLY, SHE'S AN EASY VOTE.

649
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:29,197
THE ONLY REASON I WANT HER IS
FOR NUMBERS.

650
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,032
>> I'M TOO OLD FOR.

651
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:35,370
THIS I'M DIFFERENT THAN
EVERYONE.

652
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,204
>> JUST VOTE TOM.

653
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,039
>> YOU SURE?

654
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,290
OKAY.

655
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,418
>> YESTERDAY THAT TEST ALLOWED
ME TO SEE HOW WELL I WORK UNDER

656
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,505
PRESSURE, HOW WELL I CAN KEEP
CALM WHEN IT COMES TO SITUATIONS

657
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:50,051
LIKE THIS ONE TODAY, AND SO I AM
GOING TO BRING MY HIDDEN

658
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,887
IMMUNITY IDOL, BECAUSE IT'S ONLY
GOOD FOR THE NEXT TWO TRIBAL

659
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,224
COUNCILS THAT I GO TO, AND IF IT
TURNS OUT THAT I FEEL MY NAME IS

660
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:07,360
COMING UP, THAT'S DEFINITELY
GOING TO HAVE THE PLAY IT.

661
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,194
>> TOM.

662
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:12,240
>> I'M THINKING OF THE PROS AND
CONS.

663
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,076
>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL TR-t
TO FIGURE OUT, DO WE WANT TO PUT

664
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,414
THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTES ON
VINCE WITH A BACK-UP OPTION OF

665
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:24,252
KARISHMA IN CASE HE PLAYS AN
IDOL, OR TOM?

666
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:30,091
>> THE THING WITH TOM, HE'S JUST
CHILLING IN THE SHELTER.

667
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,844
HE HAS NO IDEA HIS NAME IS BEING
THROWN AROUND.

668
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,138
IF WE VOTE OUT TOM, I STILL HAVE
MY GIRL ALLIANCE, THE ONLY ISSUE

669
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:40,226
IS THE GUYS COMING BACK THE CAMP
MAD AT US BECAUSE THE GIRLS PUT

670
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,229
ALL THE VOTES ON TOM, BUT THE
TRIBE IS BASICALLY BEING RUN BY

671
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:48,568
THE WOMEN RIGHT NOW, AND I DON'T
THINK THE GUYS EVEN REALIZE IT.

672
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:52,280
AND VINCE, HE'S PRETTY ALIGNED
WITH ME AND THE GIRL, SO I WOULD

673
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,116
BE VOTING OUT A POTENTIAL ALLY
IN THIS GAME, AND I DON'T WANT

674
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,243
THE LOOK BACK AND THINK THAT'S
WHERE I WENT WRONG.

675
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,156
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

676
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,993
SO, SECOND TRIBAL, YOU'RE NOT
NEWBIES ANYMORE.

677
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:41,245
TOM, IN THE HOURS LEADING UP TO
TRIBAL, DID YOU THINK THIS WAS

678
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:46,000
THE SAME VIBE AS FIRST TRIBAL,
OR WAS THERE A DIFFERENT SENSE?

679
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,293
>> I FELT A DIFFERENT SENSE.

680
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:51,005
WE'VE HAD A GREAT TEAM, BUT
WE'VE LOST TWICE THE SAME WAY.

681
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,508
WE HAVE LED THE PHYSICAL
PORTION, AND WE GET TO A PUZZLE

682
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,801
AND WE DON'T WIN.

683
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,012
WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE STEP UP AND
SAY, I'M GOING TO DO THE PUZZLE

684
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,306
AND THEN THEY DON'T DO IT,
THAT'S DISHEARTENING.

685
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,558
I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO
POINT FINGERS.

686
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,186
>> AARON, IT LOOKED LIKE YOU
WERE NODDING IN AGREEMENT.

687
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,355
>>
>> IT WAS FRUSTRATINGMENT WE

688
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,192
DELIVER THEM A LEAD, AND THE
LAST TWO PUZZLES, WE'RE 0-2.

689
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,445
PEOPLE NEED TO STEP UP AND SAY,
I'M NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES, BECAUSE

690
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,866
IF EVERY TIME THIS TRIBE HAS TO
GO UP AGAINST A PUZZLE, WE'RE

691
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,202
GOING THE WIND UP BACK HERE.

692
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,370
>> Jeff: KARISHMA, YOU HAD A
BIG REACTION?

693
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:27,333
DID YOU FEEL A FINGER-POINTING
AT YOU?

694
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,377
>> YOU HEARD WHAT TOM HAD TO SAY
AND AARON HAD TO SAY.

695
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,337
THEY WERE CLEARLY POINTING THE
FINGER AT ME.

696
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,592
I WANT TO RESPOND AND SAY, THIS
TRIBE HAS NOT SEEN WHAT I CAN DO

697
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,552
ATHLETICALLY YET.

698
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,386
I'M 5'9".

699
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,429
I'M BUILT VERY WIDE AND STRONG.

700
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:44,600
I CAN PROBABLY PICK CHELSEA UP
AND THROW HER ACROSS THE ROOM,

701
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,729
NOT THAT I WOULD EVERY DO, THAT
BUT I KNOW WHEN PUSH COMES TO

702
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,733
SHOVE AND IT'S FOR MY TRIBE, I
CAN PUSH HARDER THAN ANYONE HAS

703
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,235
EVER SEEN AND I KNOW IT.

704
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,363
>> Jeff: IS THIS COMING FROM A
PLACE THAT THIS MIGHT BE ME

705
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,906
GOING HOME AND IT SHOULDN'T BE.

706
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,574
>> ABSOLUTELY.

707
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,825
FORGET STRENGTH FOR A SECOND.

708
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,245
THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER WAYS ON
"SURVIVOR" YOU CAN BE AN ASSET.

709
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,414
I SNOW SOMETIMES MAYBE I'M ON
THE OUTS AND I CAN UNDERSTAND

710
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,418
WHY, I'M NOT NECESSARILY LIKE A
LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON MY TRIBE,

711
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,130
I'M A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO RELATE, BUT

712
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,258
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I CANNOT
BE A STRONG ALLY IN THIS GAME.

713
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,260
>> Jeff: WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU
THAT FEELS DIFFERENT THAN THE

714
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,553
OTHERS ON THIS TRIBE?

715
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:27,435
>> WELL, I'M OLDER THAN CHELSEA,
MISSY, AND ELIZABETH, AND I FIND

716
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:32,607
MYSELF SITTING THERE AS AN
AUDIENCE MEMBER TO THEIR

717
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,942
SORORITY AT TIMES.

718
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,944
AND THEY KNOW IT AS MUCH AS I
KNOW IT.

719
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,031
>> IT WAS NEVER OUR INTENTION TO
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE THAT.

720
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,449
YOU'RE ONE OF THE GIRLS.

721
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:46,120
AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.

722
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:49,457
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH, EVERYBODY
HERE HAS ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT

723
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,086
THE END AND A FINAL THREE AND A
FINAL FIVE AND A FINAL SEVEN.

724
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,300
SO WHEN DOES THE GAME SHIFT FROM
KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG TO KEEP MY

725
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,343
TIGHT GROUP STRONG?

726
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,638
>> I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DEFINITELY
APPROACHING THAT.

727
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,431
IF WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AS
INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS, WE HAVE THE

728
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:09,310
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THAT WE
PERSONALLY HAVE AND SEE IF THOSE

729
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,772
ARE THE NUMBERS THAT WILL CARRY
US TO A SWAP OR A MERGE OR TO

730
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,358
THE FINAL THREE, WHATEVER IT IS.

731
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,818
>> Jeff: TOM, DOES THAT
SURPRISE YOU THAT ONLY ON DAY

732
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,279
EIGHT PEOPLE ARE ALREADY
THINKING, MAYBE I JUST KEEP MY

733
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,489
GROUP STRONG.

734
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,407
>> WELL, GIVEN THAT WE'VE LOST
TWICE IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT

735
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,659
ALL.

736
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,452
I CAME INTO THIS THING WITH THE
GOAL TO NEVER LOSE A CHALLENGE

737
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,787
AND ALREADY WE'VE LOST TWICE.

738
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,829
SO I WANT THE WIN.

739
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,580
WE CLEARLY HAVE A PROBLEM.

740
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,831
I WANT THE PROBLEM FIXED.

741
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,001
>> Jeff: ELAINE, NO MATTER HOW
MANY TIMES I ASK TOM A QUESTION,

742
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,338
THE ANSWER HAS BEEN THE SAME
THING -- I WANT TO WIN.

743
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,423
I WANT THE GET RID OF THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE MAKING US LOSE.

744
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:43,970
>> I KIND OF THINK THAT'S JUST
DAD.

745
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,514
BASICALLY AS LONG AS HE DON'T
FEEL SHAFTED, THEN HE'S GIING TO

746
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,848
STAY TRUE TO WHAT HE SAYS.

747
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,518
TO ME THAT'S IMPORTANT, BECAUSE
LATER ON I FEEL LIKE WHEN THE

748
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,063
GAME MOVES FORWARD OR WHATEVER,
YOU NEED THAT TRUST.

749
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,024
>> Jeff: AARON, WHERE ARE YOU
RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF I'M

750
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,902
TRUSTING MY GUT AND I'M NOT
GOING TO LET WHAT I HEARD

751
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,070
TONIGHT INFLUENCE ME?

752
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,282
>> I'M 100% GOING IN WITH THE
PLAN THAT I CAME TO WITH MY

753
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:05,783
ALLIANCE.

754
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,243
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

755
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,495
>> Jeff: VINCE, HAVE YOU BEEN
INFLUENCED AT ALL TONIGHT?

756
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,748
>> NEW YORK I MEAN, YOU REALLY
JUST HAVE TO TRUST THE PEOPLE

757
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,418
WHO YOU HAVE SAID YOU'RE
CONNECTED WITH, AND, YOU KNOW,

758
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,336
DON'T LET THE PARANOIA SET IN.

759
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,006
I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING
THAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOURSELF

760
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,550
HERE AND THAT YOU AND YOUR
ALLIES, GO WITH THE PLAN AND

761
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,094
STICK WITH THE PLAN.

762
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,429
>> Jeff: HOW ABOUT YOU, TOM?

763
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,222
HAVE YOU BEEN INFLUENCED
TONIGHT?

764
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,599
OR IS THIS A LOT OF TALK, LET'S
GET TO IT?

765
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,059
>> A LOT OF TALK.

766
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,854
LET'S GET TO IT.

767
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:44,363
>> ONE SECOND.

768
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,373
>> TOM, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
HAPPENING WHEN YOU SAY THIS IS

769
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:54,874
AN ACT?

770
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:55,666
AN ACT FOR WHO?

771
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,586
>> I UNDERSTAND WHY SHE'S DOING
IT.

772
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,546
SHE'S SCRAMBLING SO SHE THINKS
SHE'S ON THE HOT SEAT.

773
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:04,550
SO SHE WANTS TO SHOW THAT SHE'S
TRYING THE CHANGE THE PLAN.

774
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:09,638
AND I DON'T BUY IT AT ALL.

775
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,139
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

776
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,599
IT IS TIME THE VOTE.

777
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:18,731
ELIZABETH, YOU'RE UP.

778
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,625
>> THIS WAS INTENDED FOR VINCE,
BUT AS SOMEONE ONCE SAID, SPLIT

779
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,709
THE VOTE.

780
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:04,485
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

781
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,154
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

782
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:21,168
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

783
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:21,669
OKAY.

784
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,171
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

785
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:28,884
>> OH, MY GOD.

786
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,720
>> Jeff: FIRST VOTE, TOM.

787
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,683
KARISHMA.

788
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:39,186
KARISHMA.

789
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:39,854
KARISHMA.

790
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,729
THREE VOTES KARISHMA.

791
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:46,068
ONE VOTE TOM.

792
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,529
VINCE.

793
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,322
VINCE.

794
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:58,372
THAT'S TWO VOTES VINCE,.

795
00:40:58,455 --> 00:40:59,373
VINCE.

796
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:00,457
WE'RE TIED.

797
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:05,546
THREE VOTES VINCE, THREE VOTES
KARISHMA, ONE VOTE TOM.

798
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,755
VINCE.

799
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:14,513
THAT'S FOUR VOTES VINCE, THREE
VOTES KARISHMA, ONE VOTE LEFT.

800
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,765
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT, VINCE.

801
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,728
YOU NEED BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

802
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:28,527
>> HE'S LEAVING WITH AN IDOL IN
HIS POCKET.

803
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,154
>> Jeff: VINCE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

804
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:43,751
>> GOOD LUCK, ALL.

805
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,712
>> Jeff: WELL, YOU MAY SUCK AT
PUZZLES, BUT YOU'RE REALLY GOOD

806
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,838
AT BLINDSIDES.

807
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,423
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

808
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:49,757
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

809
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,717
GOOD NIGHT.

BLOSSOMS --
>> OH, THIS IS PERFECT.

816

>> ME AND CHELSEA, THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO GET

817
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:17,952
SWASHED.

818
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,453
>> Jeff: YOU MUST PROTECT YOUR
SECRETS.

819
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:22,623
>> ONE OF YOU MUSS GO TO THE
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

820
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,125
>> THIS COULD BLOW UP MY GAME.

821
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,043
>> TO YOUR RIGHT.

822
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:31,966
>> I WAS JUST BLINDSIDED I GUESS
YOU CAN SAY.

823
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,801
I DID BRING THE IDOL IN MY WATER
BOTTLE.

824
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:38,806
AND I WAS THINKING OF BEING
LIKE, JEFF.

825
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,517
FIRST TIME IN "SURVIVOR"
HISTORY.

826
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,436
I RELIED TOO MUCH ON THE TRUST
THAT I HAD WITH THE WOMEN.

827
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,939
IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION,
AND I THINK THAT REALLY BIT ME

828
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,023
IN THE BUTT.
