1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,840
Hello, Survivor fans.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,560
We are live backstage
at CBS in Los Angeles

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,320
for the two-hour season finale
of Survivor: Game Changers.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,480
Here they are, the Game Changers.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,080
The season players.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,440
You knew it was going
to be bloody when

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,800
when Nalcolm went out
early, Sandra was dethroned.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,120
Even this nut, Tony, couldn't
get any traction.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,760
This season had some of the most
Intertaining and risky game play

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,640
ever, and the good news,
it's not over.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,440
More history will happen tonight.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,600
All right, here's what's going on.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,040
We have a two-hour season finale.
We're going to read the votes.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
We'll announce the winner.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,320
Then we bring everybody on stage
for the live reunion show,

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,960
and there is a lot to cover.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,160
Including one of the
most talked about

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,560
moments in the history of Survivor:

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,240
when Zeke was outed
as being transgender.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,160
If you have questions or
comments for the group

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
it's not o late, you can
hit me up at @JEFFPROBST

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,760
at Twitter, hashtag #SURVIVORFINALE.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,440
Also tonight, we are going
to show you what

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,800
we are doing next season.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,760
We have a packed
house here on CBS.

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,920
They are ready.
I know you are.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
Here's the deal.
Six people left.

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,560
Tai has patiently held
on to two idols.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,160
Troyzan has an idol.

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,280
Sarah has the Legacy Advantage.

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,560
It's a lot of game-changing
power still left in the game.

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,360
And once again, we go into a
finale still very uncertain who

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,960
will take home
the title of Survivor

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,160
and the million dollars.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,600
Here it is, the season
finale of Survivor.

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,200
For the first time
ever, we brought 20 of

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,960
Survivor's biggest game
changers to Fiji

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
to battle against each other.

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,360
You gotta go big or go home.

40
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,800
The game play started early.

41
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,480
They're going to be looking
for spy shacks.

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,240
They ain't going to be looking
for an underground bunker.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,520
And the players lift up
to their high.

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,880
Crazy!

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,400
As they revolutionizinged Survivor again.

46
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,880
With bold moves...

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,240
wild game play...

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,280
I was loyal to you completely
and you crushed my heart!

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,720
It's frustrating, and i'm pissed!

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,320
and unforgettable Tribal Councils.

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,160
What the hell is
going on here, Jeff?

52
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,280
Oh, my gosh!

53
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,440
Where risky idol plays...

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,480
I'm going to give the idol to...

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,680
pretty lady.

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,840
I'm going to vomit.

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
epic face-offs...

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,760
J.T.

59
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
Damn!

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,440
and raw emotion.

61
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,720
I didn't want to be, like,
the tran Survivor player,

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,600
i want to be Zeke
the Survivor player.

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,960
- And you are.
- And i feel like i am.

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,560
All led to a slew
of devastating blindsides.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,920
The tribe has spoken.

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
And at the last Tribal Council...

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,440
There is a rat in this group,

68
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,640
so i am going
to steal Sarah's vote.

69
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,880
Well, actually,
that's my advantage.

70
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,920
It's nontransferable.
It says it on the bottom.

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,640
Cirie, sarah is the only person
who can use that advantage.

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,480
a foiled attempt by
Cirie to flip the game

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,880
upside down resulted in more chaos.

74
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,360
You know what, Jeff?
I'm going to use my advantage.

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,960
Whose vote are you
going to steal?

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,440
I'm going to take Tai's.

77
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,640
And Michaela was
sent to the jury.

78
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,720
Michaela, the tribe has spoken.

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,960
Leaving everyone scrambling for
a seat in the final three.

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,600
Now, only six remain.

81
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,160
Sarah, since the merge, she has
played an aggressive game,

82
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,000
bouncing from one alliance to
another taking out anyone

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
standing in her way.

84
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
Sierra.

85
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
I will be giving it to Sarah.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,720
It worked.

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,440
With the Legacy Advantage
guaranteeing her a

88
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,040
spot in the final five, she is
in a power position 

89
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,440
to shift the game again.

90
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,160
I deserve to be a Game Changer.

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,200
I didn't leave my son for 39
days to not win $1 million.

92
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,000
Troyzan, for weeks,
he has quietly played

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,760
from the bottom.

94
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,240
Oh, my god!

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,800
Good job, guys!

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,280
But with a hidden
immunity idol still in his pocket,

97
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
and alliances in turmoil,

98
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,280
the timing may be right
for Troyzan to make a move.

99
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,360
When everything is not
looking your way, there is

100
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,760
something always in you,
Troyzan, that is going to click

101
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,640
and say: "Never give up,

102
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,280
you can make it through anything."

103
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,200
Tai, his uncanny ability to
find hidden immunity idols...

104
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,120
Holy cow!

105
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Survivor gods really looked at me.

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,560
and his patience to not
play them leaves Tai in a

107
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,760
powerful position, with two idols

108
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,360
and only three Tribal
Councils remaining.

109
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
I'm not afraid to make big moves.

110
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,280
Because you want
to make big moves.

111
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,920
You have to take
the bull and own it.

112
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,080
Culpepper, his social
game was dominant early.

113
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,480
You've got to think about
what's best for your game.

114
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,720
Are you in it for him or you?

115
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,480
But since merge, he
has been on the wrong side

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,040
of the numbers.

117
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,040
I have to win immunity for me
to be able to make it another day.

118
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,840
With no immunity
idols or advantages,

119
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,640
winning challenges may
be of the only way Culpepper

120
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
can make it to the
Final Tribal Council.

121
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,040
Playing Survivor your
guard is always up.

122
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,960
And if you relax,
if you nap on the job,

123
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,320
you're going home.

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,600
Aubry, it's been another
season of highs and lows

125
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
for this strategic force.

126
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,320
Aubry has it!

127
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,400
It really felt great at the
immunity challenge winning.

128
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,840
but had a good
relationship with Andrea,

129
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,800
so, naturally, she's
killed off too.

130
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,280
But she is once again
within striking distance

131
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
of the end.

132
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,960
Can Aubry find her way back to
the final three or will she be

133
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,000
voted out for the first time in
her Survivor career.

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,960
I'm in deep doo-doo, but

135
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,560
that's the Aubry way, always
hanging on by the skin of my teeth.

136
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,480
Cirie, this Survivor
legend and perennial

137
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,400
fan favorite has once again
relied on social relationships

138
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,880
and savvy game play.

139
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,000
Tai sees Sarah as a threat.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,320
I need to get Tai comfortable
enough to trust me.

141
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,400
Can i believe you?

142
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,080
When you see me stand up and
play that advantage, are you still

143
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,240
can't believe me?

144
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,160
Okay.

145
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,320
In her four seasons,
Cirie has never found an idol or

146
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,480
won an individual
immunity challenge.

147
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,800
You got it, Cirie.

148
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,440
But with the million
dollars once again in sight,

149
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,160
is this when it finally
all comes together?

150
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
To stay in this
game at this point,

151
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,600
you have to see everything.

152
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,920
And if you skip over the picture
that's right in front of you

153
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,360
because you're
looking down the road,

154
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,040
it will get your torch extinguished.

155
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,760
Trust me.
I know.

156
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,040
With six game-changing
players, three idols, 

157
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,520
and the Legacy Advantage
still in play, 

158
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,240
the stage is set for a wild
and historic finish.

159
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Who will have what it takes to
outwit, outplay, and outlast all

160
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,600
the rest to win the million dollars

161
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,360
and the title of Sole Survivor.

162
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,040
Subtitulado por: TwiNe

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
All right, i want to
know who the rat was.

164
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,840
I want to know
what did Michaela do.

165
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,520
Nothing.

166
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,600
So it was just random...

167
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,480
I felt betrayed by
Cirie at Tribal Council

168
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,120
playing my "steal a vote."

169
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,960
So i targeted Michaela because

170
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,800
Michaela is Cirie's
right-hand man.

171
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,760
But now, i don't
know who i can trust.

172
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,480
Fortunately, i still have the
Legacy Advantage,

173
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,120
which can be played at six.

174
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,920
So i know i'm safe.

175
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,720
Tthat was my advantage
to use, not yours.

176
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,880
Why would you take my vote?

177
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,320
Because Tai said: "Sarah,
she's the biggest threat."

178
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,000
If somebody says your name--

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
You need to talk to me about this

180
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
if we're going to be in an
alliance together.

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,680
Because i wanted to use
that at another time

182
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
and now i can't because of you.

183
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
This is true, this is true.

184
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,440
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.

185
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,120
Sarah is really pissed and
thinks i'm trying to pull an

186
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
okey-doke on her.

187
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
And kind felt like:
"Whoa, i'm trying to do you a favor."

188
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,920
But as the saying goes: "No good
deed goes unpunished."

189
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,320
Hopefully there's something to
be saved, salvaged.

190
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,520
I don't know.

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,240
I want to know who the rat
was supposed to be exposed?

192
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,320
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

193
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,960
I felt that Tai was playing
you, me, and them.

194
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,880
Nope.

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,160
Aubry, you know?

196
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,080
You've been a part of those
conversations.

197
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
Tai said that we
should get Sarah out.

198
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,600
So i told him about the advantage.

199
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,360
Nope.

200
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,160
I didn't tell you
about my advantage?

201
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,840
Just found it out when?

202
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,320
- Before we go Tribal?
- Tonight.

203
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,400
You did tonight.

204
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,680
- Before we left.
- No.

205
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,480
Oh, my god.

206
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,200
Tai, are the one that threw
my name out there?

207
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,400
Just answer that honestly to me.

208
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Was it you?

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,160
I did say that.

210
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,960
I just said: "Theoretically who is
the biggest threat?"

211
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,640
You were going to
vote me out tonight.

212
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,160
- Yes, because she told me--
- I apologize.

213
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,960
- I've been trying to tell you this.
- I apologize.

214
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,120
Sarah.

215
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,720
- You and i--
- You know Tai...

216
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,560
I don't need to hear
anymore right now.

217
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,520
Please, hear me.

218
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,920
You're going to fucking
vote me out tonight!

219
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,160
I put my ass on
the line for you,

220
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,440
and i would have
gone home tonight

221
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,000
because you stabbed
me in the back.

222
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
So i don't need to hear anymore.

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,400
- She set me up, i thought--
- No, Tai!

224
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,200
With you.

225
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,280
Then why would
you vote me out?

226
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,480
I don't know.
I panicked.

227
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,560
Last time i played i didn't do
any lying, didn't do anything.

228
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
And this time i said
this is Game Changers.

229
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
I want to play a little bit.

230
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,160
I felt like i was doing what
everybody else was doing anyway

231
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,240
but i got caught.

232
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,400
Now i am Tai, the liar.

233
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,680
I think i screwed up my game,
now my options are limited.

234
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,760
Luckily, i still have two idols
that nobody knows about.

235
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,320
Maybe i can use
them to gain trust.

236
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,000
I need to have
someone to lean on.

237
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,600
I found one here, and found
one there with the same clue.

238
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,400
I was going to tell you
and Sarah at the same time.

239
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm not, i'm not.
She's so pissed off.

240
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,000
- No, i´m not. I'm with you now.
- Okay.

241
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,560
I'll play it today, play it
tomorrow without telling you,

242
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,480
but i feel i owe you that.

243
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
Tell me what you
want me to do with it.

244
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,960
Just hold on to
it for right now.

245
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Tai's whole game has imploded.

246
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,920
He's been caught in a web of lies.

247
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,160
He felt so bad this morning he
wanted to make amend with me

248
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,760
and told me he had two idols.

249
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,880
Now, do i really believe him?

250
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,880
I don't know.

251
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,800
I haven't really trusted Tai
since he voted out Sierra.

252
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,360
But if he's looking for a home,
i can definitely use him as a number.

253
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,280
I can help him get
further in the game,

254
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
but i have to have collateral.

255
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
You want to keep playing,
i'm your key.

256
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,880
- Yes.
- Don't fall into any trap.

257
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,760
- I'm not.
- We'll keep it locked.

258
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,680
I manipulated him
on the first one,

259
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,720
and i'm going to manipulate
him on these two as well.

260
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
He lied to me numerous times.

261
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,200
I have no problem throwing him
under the bus voting him out

262
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,360
with his own idol.

263
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,160
Come on in, guys!

264
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,520
Day 36, six people left.

265
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,120
Shall we get to
today's immunity challenge?

266
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,760
Yes.

267
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,040
First things first,
Culpepper, take it back.

268
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,840
Thank you.

269
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,040
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

270
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,160
For today's challenge, you're
going to race through a giant

271
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,400
maze, collecting three bags of
puzzle pieces along the way.

272
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,680
Once you have all your bags,
you'll use the pieces inside to

273
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,040
solve a compass rose puzzle.

274
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,240
First to finish wins immunity,
safe from the vote.

275
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,360
Losers, tribal council, where
somebody will be the 15th

276
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,960
person voted out of this game
and become the eighth member of

277
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,840
our jury.

278
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,000
In addition, you're
playing for reward.

279
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,400
The winner will have delivered
to them at camp chicken parm.

280
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,840
Oh, man!

281
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,880
Spaguetti with meat sauce.

282
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,680
Garlic bread, and key lime pie...

283
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,080
- Damn!
- for dessert.

284
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Worth playing for?

285
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,520
Yeah.

286
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,160
We'll draw spots and get it on.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,120
Here we go, for immunity.

288
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,040
Guaranteed spot in the final
five, and a nice reward.

289
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,760
Survivors ready?

290
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,280
Go!

291
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,600
There are two sides to this maze.

292
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,280
Troyzan, Aubry, and Cirie are
working one side.

293
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,120
Culpepper, Tai, and Sarah
working the other.

294
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,240
You have three bags
total that you have to

295
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,960
collect from your side.

296
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,880
That's it.

297
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,600
Once you have all three bags,
you start working on that puzzle.

298
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,800
Troyzan at his first station.

299
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,280
Culpepper heading to his first station.

300
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,000
Tai right on his tail.

301
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,520
Troyzan has his first bag.
He's heading back.

302
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,160
Culpepper coming
back with his first bag.

303
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,960
Culpepper takes a big fall!

304
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,600
Tai right behind him.

305
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,400
Tai falling down now!

306
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,440
Troyzan is back with his first bag.

307
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,640
Culpepper coming
back with his first bag.

308
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
Tai right behind him.

309
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,760
Literally just following the
path that Culpepper is leading.

310
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,000
Culpepper drops his first,
heads back out.

311
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,680
Tai heading back out
for his second bag.

312
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,440
Aubry has her first bag.

313
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,880
Cirie now has her first bag.

314
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,000
Sarah has her first bag.
She's heading back.

315
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,040
After 36 days,
who wants it more?

316
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,560
Cirie right on Aubry's tail now.

317
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,640
Sarah has her first.
She's looking for her second.

318
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Troyzan is in the lead.
He has that second bag.

319
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,280
Culpepper at the second station.

320
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,800
And once again, Tai is just
trying to follow Culpepper.

321
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,720
Aubry untying that second bag.

322
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
She's heading back now.

323
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Troyzan drops his second bag.

324
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,480
But he dropped it
at the wrong puzzle.

325
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm color blind.

326
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,120
I'll take it!

327
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,120
Culpepper back with
his second bag.

328
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,360
He has distanced himself from Tai.

329
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,360
It is Aubry, Troyzan, Culpepper,
and Tai all looking for their

330
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,400
third and final bag
as Sarah and Cirie

331
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,840
head back with their second.

332
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,280
Sarah looking lost in that maze.

333
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,040
Aubry trying to get
to that third station.

334
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,520
And she's done it!

335
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Aubry has her third bag.
She starts untying.

336
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,560
Aubry has her third bag.
She's heading back.

337
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,000
Culpepper's now racing
back with his third bag.

338
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,000
Sarah back out now.

339
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Culpepper will be back first.

340
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,200
He can start working on that puzzle.

341
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Aubry right behind Culpepper.

342
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,800
Here comes Cirie.

343
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,880
It is Culpepper, Cirie,
Aubry and Troyzan with the

344
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,840
early lead working
on their puzzles.

345
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,080
Huge stakes, guaranteed
certainty tonight at Tribal.

346
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,800
There are 41 pieces in this puzzle.

347
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,200
All you have to do is
figure out where they go.

348
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,240
Tai back with his third bag.

349
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,720
Sarah coming back
with her third bag.

350
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,920
36 days in, you
want to get to 37.

351
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,760
you will most
definitely earn it.

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,800
A lot of these pieces require
another piece or two.

353
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,360
You have to figure out where
they go, remember,

354
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,360
and then find the supporting
piece that goes with it.

355
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,760
Right now it is Culpepper and
Aubry with the most pieces placed.

356
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,200
Sarah's got a couple
of pieces in there.

357
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,880
Slow going for Tai right now.

358
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,480
Both Cirie and Troyzan taking
a different approach,

359
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
studying their pieces first.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,360
Sarah working methodically.

361
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,280
Now Culpepper pulling pieces
out, trying to rearrange them.

362
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,640
It is difficult.

363
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,360
But once you start to figure out
how this puzzle working,

364
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,000
you can get on a roll.

365
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,080
Culpepper with another piece.

366
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,040
Sarah with another piece.

367
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,480
Aubry starting to fall behind.

368
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,480
Tai struggling.

369
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,240
Troyzan trying to get in on this.

370
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,280
Cirie has yet to place
a single piece.

371
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Culpepper down to 12 pieces left.

372
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,400
Sarah slowly, piece by piece,
gaining on Brad's lead.

373
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,840
But it's Sarah and
Culpepper right now

374
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,520
battling it out for immunity.

375
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,160
Culpepper now down
to six pieces left.

376
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,200
Sarah trying to catch up.

377
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,920
Can she do it?

378
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,960
Culpepper reworking it now.

379
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,240
Sarah looking for
the right pieces.

380
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,280
Culpepper down to his last piece
but something isn't right.

381
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,000
Culpepper now searching
bags for a missing piece.

382
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,360
And it's been in his
bag the entire time.

383
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,640
Will that make a difference?
Can Sarah catch Culpepper?

384
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,040
Culpepper adds another.

385
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,800
Culpepper down to
his last two pieces.

386
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,880
It would be his third
individual immunity win.

387
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,560
And he does.

388
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,840
Culpepper wins individual
immunity and reward!

389
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,440
Guaranteed a spot
in the final five.

390
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,000
Holy shit!

391
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,520
Pretty good for a dumb jock.

392
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,840
Culpepper, come on over.

393
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,400
For the third time, individual
immunity is yours.

394
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,440
You are safe
tonight at Tribal Council.

395
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,200
Cannot be voted out of this game.

396
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,680
In addition, you have won reward.

397
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,640
Choose one person that will join
you at camp to enjoy this meal.

398
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,520
Troy.

399
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,520
Didn't even hesitate
with Troyzan.

400
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,960
He hasn't been on
anything in a long time.

401
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,560
Troyzan going to
enjoy the meal tonight.

402
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,040
Thank you so much.

403
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,080
Choose one more person.

404
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,800
Everybody hungry.

405
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,960
Big decision because you are
choosing one person

406
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,240
to eat with you and
three that will not.

407
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,640
- Sarah.
- Sarah, come on over.

408
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,080
All right, so here's
what's going to happen.

409
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,640
You guys are all
going back to camp.

410
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,040
Food will be delivered
for you three.

411
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,960
After you eat, i will see you
tonight at Tribal, where

412
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,760
somebody will be the 15th
person voted out of this game

413
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,080
and become the
eighth member of the jury.

414
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,640
It will not be you.
Congrats.

415
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,560
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp, guys.

416
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,760
See you guys at tribal.

417
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,160
Given the drama that happened
at the last Tribal Council,

418
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,920
i'm not really sure
where i stand with people.

419
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,240
And this reward is
what i needed.

420
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,120
I've got to find out who is
willing to go to the end with me

421
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,680
And i'm going to do whatever i
have to do to solidify my spot.

422
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,600
This is insane.

423
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,600
I cannot even tell you
how good this tastes.

424
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,960
The fact that Brad won
is just outstanding.

425
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,200
Brad and i, we're
as solid as it gets.

426
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,240
So if he wins, i win.

427
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,760
And i have an idol which i can
play either tonight or the next

428
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,080
Tribal Council, which
makes me feel safe.

429
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,280
So i feel like i'm
in a good place.

430
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,560
But we've got stuff to do.
We have to win immunities.

431
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,640
We have to play immunity idols.
We have to be smart.

432
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,160
Nice done Brad Culpepper.
Amazing victory.

433
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,120
Thank you, Brad.

434
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,480
I've got the Legacy Advantage,
and nobody knows about it.

435
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,120
So i'm lucky that i'm safe tonight.

436
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,400
But at this point, i
have to go with people

437
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,120
that are gonna take
me to the end.

438
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,720
I felt betrayed by Cirie at
Tribal Council, and Tai, 

439
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,680
i clearly can't trust him.

440
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,080
So the only choice i have right
now is to go with Brad and Troy.

441
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,120
Who do you guys
want to vote out, though?

442
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,240
I think we put votes on Tai
and votes on Aubry.

443
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,600
I really think Aubry is a
bigger immunity threat than him.

444
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
- Let's all three vote Aubry.
- Okay.

445
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,680
Tai informed me this
morning he has two idols.

446
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,000
That puts Tai in a power
position that makes me super

447
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,440
leery because i've seen
him flip a couple of times.

448
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,920
So i need to get back to camp
and make sure everybody is on

449
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,240
the right page because i don't
want any funky business

450
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,240
with two idols tonight.

451
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,360
What's up?

452
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,200
Do you want to go to the end?

453
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,040
Okay.
Good.

454
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,240
Here's the plan.

455
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,120
Aubry's going home.

456
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,240
- Okay?
- Okay.

457
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,720
You're going to give me
your other one to hold.

458
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,360
because i don't want
any funny business.

459
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,080
It's just i need a leap of faith
from you because

460
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,840
of the way things have been.

461
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,360
I know.

462
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,320
Brad come back, and he said:
"This is what needs to happen.

463
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,600
Aubry's going home, but...

464
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,360
in order to gain
complete trust from me,

465
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,360
you can't have both idols.

466
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,640
You need to give me one."

467
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,040
You want to go to the end,
that's what you've got to do.

468
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,920
Listen, every single Tribal
Council i have gone to

469
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,200
has not gone as i expected.

470
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
And i'm not going in there
tonight with you playing an idol

471
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,520
and somebody else playing an
idol, and it all goes haywire.

472
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
Well, maybe you did.

473
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,120
It's in my hands.

474
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,960
Your destiny now is
tonight, and that's it.

475
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,320
You've done that.

476
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,120
But if i do that, he'll
bring me to the final three.

477
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,440
I said: "great, now i
belong somewhere."

478
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,760
But the back of my mind, i worry
if i give the idol to Brad,

479
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,760
he'll make a fool out of me.

480
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,720
Not right now, i have to
think this through.

481
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,480
Tai showed me his two idols
and i'm like: "holy crap."

482
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,360
I guess in some way he's
reaching out like:

483
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,760
"I want to be a trustworthy guy,"
but at the same time,

484
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,520
he's still acting sketchy.

485
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,400
The thing is he could play it
tonight, he could play it tomorrow.

486
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,280
And then confirm his 4th position.

487
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,680
Yeah.

488
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,040
So tonight i will play with you.

489
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,680
Em, i need...

490
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,480
Are you being
straight with me, Tai?

491
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,760
- I'm being so straight with you.
- I know, i know.

492
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,440
I know, Tai, after everything,
it's hard for you to trust me.

493
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,680
I understand that.

494
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,040
However, if we don't do anything,

495
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,360
they're going to just
pick us off one by one.

496
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,000
At this point, Sarah,
Troyzan, and Brad

497
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,480
just came from the reward.

498
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,480
And i'm not sure
what they discussed.

499
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,760
After last night's Tribal, i'd
be surprised if they weren't

500
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
going to come after me.

501
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,160
So i tried to tell Tai that we need
to put all our differences aside

502
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,200
and come together and get
on rid one of those three.

503
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,080
We can't do Brad.
It's either Sarah or Troyzan.

504
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,320
We have to do something.
I promise i won't betray you.

505
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,160
I swear, right hand to god,
i promise i won't screw you, Tai.

506
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,960
The only thing is, Tai knows
everything that happened to him

507
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,120
last night was because of me, so
i'm sure he doesn't trust me.

508
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,040
Please, Tai, i'm sorry.

509
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,400
- Go, go.
- Okay, okay.

510
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,360
I don't know.

511
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,080
Once again, i feel like my
life in the game is in Tai's

512
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,720
hands, which kind of sucks
because 10 minutes before

513
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,560
Tribal, he's having
an emotional breakdown.

514
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,480
Like what?

515
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,720
- Tai has two idols.
- He's got two?

516
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,040
Yeah.

517
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,760
So did he give
Brad one of them?

518
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,600
Not yet.

519
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,280
I can't decide what to do.

520
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,760
Brad, he ordered me around.
It's like a threat.

521
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,720
At the same time,
i don't trust Cirie at all.

522
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,160
Are we sure he's
going to vote with us?

523
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,360
I don't know.

524
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,480
- What else do we have right now?
- Nothing.

525
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,280
I don't know.
I need to toughen up.

526
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,120
I'm still here.
I still have two idols.

527
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,560
And i just have to figure
out what's best for me.

528
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,840
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.

529
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:55,320
Hali, Ozzy, Debbie,
Zeke, Sierra, Andrea

530
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,760
and Michaela voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

531
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,360
All right, let's
get straight into it.

532
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,560
Aubry, what was your take on the
fallout from the last Tribal?

533
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,920
There was a lot of talking
when we went back to camp.

534
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,320
It was kind of a therapy
session, and we kind of got to

535
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,880
the bottom of what things were.

536
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,040
What conclusion did you come to?

537
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,120
That we had a rat in our midst.

538
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,120
- Tai.
- Tai.

539
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,760
Is that what happened?
You went back to camp,

540
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,880
and all the fingers ended
up pointing at you?

541
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,520
Yes, it did.

542
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,720
It's a game of lie and deceive.

543
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,840
Everybody lies.
Everybody deceives.

544
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,000
But somehow,

545
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,520
i was the only bad guy
here and i take all the blame.

546
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,520
But you were going
to vote me out!

547
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,800
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

548
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,520
Because Cirie told me you
were targeting me first.

549
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,880
This is a game of deceive
and a game of lying.

550
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,480
Everybody does that.

551
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,720
It sounds like Tai is
making the point that we were

552
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,400
all caught lying.

553
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,280
Why am i the one that's
getting the most heat?

554
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,200
The reason all the heat is
coming on Tai is because he's

555
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,440
not taking any
responsibility for his lies.

556
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,640
- I think this is so hypocritical.
- It's not.

557
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,600
I have not lied to you.

558
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,560
Your whole alliance wanted
you out yesterday.

559
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,640
Sarah, it's an interesting situation.

560
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,160
There's a group of six.
Three shared a reward today.

561
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,960
Are you concerned that with Brad
choising Troyzan and you, that

562
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,840
the appearance would be that
the three of are you tight,

563
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,080
and that might push these
three to try to do something?

564
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,600
I think at this point, you
have five people that are tight.

565
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,200
Meaning everybody but Tai?

566
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,080
Yeah.

567
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,840
Clearly, you can tell by the way
everybody's frustrated with Tai

568
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,360
that nobody's on the
same page as Tai right now.

569
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,040
Troyzan.

570
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,040
Is it likely that Tai could
recover this late in the game?

571
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,360
Honestly, i say no, like, 90% no.

572
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,720
Cirie.

573
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,400
Have you ever seen somebody
in this kind of a hole before?

574
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,400
This game is like no other.

575
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,800
I've seen people in
worse holes than this

576
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,040
and somehow make it to the end.

577
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,560
So i never say never.

578
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,720
So, Tai, where are you
right now, emotionally, day 36?

579
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,600
You've made it to six.
You have a lot of enemies right now.

580
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,040
They all say i'm doing all the lying.

581
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,080
On top of that, there was a
conversation with me already.

582
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,680
A lot of offers, a lot of bribes.

583
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,520
Like threaten as well.

584
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,320
So you're saying people
came to you and offered

585
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,000
- to make a deal with you.
- Yes.

586
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,000
Culpepper, are you
surprised to hear Tai say he was

587
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,640
approached today with offers?

588
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,000
No, i mean, we're late in the game.
You need numbers.

589
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,960
So it makes sense that someone
would try to repair something

590
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,720
for a vote.

591
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,840
Does it concern you?

592
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,800
Buyer beware if you
try to do a deal with Tai.

593
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,240
It could maybe benefit you
or bite you in the ass.

594
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,280
Tai, what do you think
is going to happen tonight?

595
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,520
The only thing i know is my
vote, who i'm writing down.

596
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,440
That's the only
thing i can tell you.

597
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,120
How about you, Cirie?

598
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,880
How confident are you
about tonight's vote?

599
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,920
I feel as confident as the
people around me that i can trust.

600
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,680
Which is not saying a lot.

601
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,960
Wow, Aubry.

602
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:30,400
This game truly is alive
and moving moment by moment.

603
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,000
You think there's something
stable, and then it shifts.

604
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't know.

605
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,280
I feel like i've been kind of
hanging on by the bottom rung,

606
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
and i'm going to
keep the faith tonight.

607
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,680
All right, is is time to vote.
Sarah, you're up.

608
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,640
I'll go tally the votes.

609
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,200
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,

610
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,880
now would be the time to do so.

611
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,400
Jeff.

612
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,200
The blue idol i'd like
to play for myself.

613
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Okay.

614
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,520
And i have another one.

615
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,640
A red one.

616
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,840
I would like it play for Aubry.

617
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,120
Thanks, Tai.

618
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,760
These are both hidden
immunity idols.

619
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,960
Any votes cast for Tai and
Aubry, will not count.

620
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,160
Hey, Jeff.

621
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:16,120
This is a secret advantage which
is a Legacy Advantage.

622
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,160
This is only good for right now
and i don't need a souvenir.

623
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,800
- So there you go.
- All right.

624
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,120
This is the Legacy Advantage.

625
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,680
Any votes cast for
Sarah will not count.

626
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,720
Jeff.

627
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,160
I'm going to get on the
immunity train and give you that,

628
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,080
because i just feel like
being in the final five.

629
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,480
All right.

630
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,680
This is also a hidden immunity idol.

631
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,960
Any votes cast for
Troyzan will not count.

632
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:56,480
So, any votes cast for Tai,
Aubry, Sarah, Troyzan, will not count.

633
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,520
You could not vote for Culpepper.

634
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,320
He had immunity, which means
Cirie, it doesn't matter what

635
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,000
votes are in the urn,

636
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,360
because the only person
who can receive votes...

637
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,480
What?

638
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,720
Is me.

639
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,480
Is you.

640
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,880
And for what it's worth,

641
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,840
not a single vote in here
has your name on it.

642
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,760
This is a historic Tribal Council.

643
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,320
Most idols ever played
at a Tribal, three.

644
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,400
Most people ever
safe at a Tribal, five.

645
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,520
And the most significant and
devastating part of tonight's

646
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,360
history-making Tribal for you,
Cirie, is you become the first

647
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,280
person in 34 seasons to be
voted out simply because their

648
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,400
literally is no other choice.

649
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,960
There's no need to revote.

650
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,280
Wow.

651
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Cirie, you came out here
11 years ago to play this game.

652
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,880
You've played it four times now.

653
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,720
You famously got up off the couch
to see what you were made of.

654
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,480
You had another moment this
season where you conquered

655
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
a personal obstacle.

656
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,520
If this is the end
of your Survivor run,

657
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,800
what is the story?

658
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:24,280
This has been one of the most
grand experiences of my life.

659
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,240
It changed me.

660
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,240
I would have never done
any of this stuff if i...

661
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,640
didn't get off that
couch 11 years ago.

662
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,160
I would never have met
so many different people.

663
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,880
I would have never had so
many amazing experiences.

664
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,240
So it's bittersweet.

665
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,320
However, i'm going out in grand
style, it never happened before.

666
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
And it just makes this
experience that much more

667
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
special for me.

668
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,200
Cirie, how many days
of Survivor have you played now?

669
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
Not enough.

670
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,840
Cirie, i have to say,
you have played every day of

671
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,720
Survivor with grace.

672
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,520
And it has been
an honor to have you,

673
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,360
be a part of the Survivor family.

674
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,560
You are the 15th voted out
of this season.

675
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,760
You become the
eighth member of the jury.

676
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,600
- You need to grab your torch.
- Sure.

677
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,200
Cirie, you want to say it?

678
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,640
The tribe has spoken.

679
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,720
- Thank you, Jeff.
- Time for you to go.

680
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,080
Thank you, Cirie.

681
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,520
Well, a Survivor legend
goes out in legendary style.

682
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,000
You have made
it to the final five.

683
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,440
But this game is
clearly far from over.

684
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

685
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,960
Good night.

686
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,560
It's a very bittersweet
moment for me.

687
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,720
But i'm so thankful to
have had every single day.

688
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,920
I'm going to encourage my boys
and my family to get off the

689
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,200
couch and live because look at
what you miss out on

690
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,720
if you don't try.

691
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,640
Look out, world. You never know
where you might see Cirie.

692
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,360
Well, they don't come
much classier than Cirie.

693
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,760
Cirie, come out here.

694
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,680
So close, and once again, a
unique set of circumstances.

695
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,480
Come here, girl!

696
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,880
Look at that!

697
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,320
Oh, my god!

698
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,600
What does that feel
like, a standing ovation?

699
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,600
Take it in.

700
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,640
You've given a lot.
Take some back.

701
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,360
Thank you. All right, let's
hear what she has to say.

702
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,720
So, Cirie, first, that.

703
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,560
and, you know, it's interesting
to me that i rarely comment on

704
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,680
somebody personally in Survivor.

705
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,240
I try to remain neutral,

706
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,120
even though people
would say that's not true.

707
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,400
But with you, in that moment, it
was undeniable to say what a

708
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
part of this and
what you represent.

709
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,320
So what is it like to come out
here after a decade of exposing

710
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,720
yourself to all of your
vulnerabilities

711
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,760
and feel that love?

712
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,120
It's amazing.

713
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,400
I don't feel worthy.

714
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,480
It's... life changing.

715
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,400
It just... it tells the world
what a great thing a great game

716
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,240
this is, and what...

717
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,120
you can accomplish
if you just try.

718
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,840
these people would have never
known Cirie Fieldes.

719
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,440
I'm going to hug you now.

720
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,400
Oh, you're one of a kind.

721
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,760
Survivor: Game Changers,
season finale.

722
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,240
So far from over.

723
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,360
Next time i see you,
i'll have the votes.

724
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,840
Enjoy it, woman!
Take a bow!

725
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,600
Come on in, guys!

726
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,840
All right, you guys ready to get
to today's immunity challenge?

727
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,680
First things first, for the
third time, Culpepper other i

728
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,560
will take it back.

729
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,120
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

730
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,600
For today's challenge,

731
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,040
you're going to use
paddles to maneuver

732
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,240
a ball through a
series of obstacles.

733
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,760
If the ball drops, you go back
to the start and begin again.

734
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,800
The first person to
transfer three balls

735
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,880
to the finish wins immunity.

736
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,800
Safe from the vote, guaranteed
a spot in the final four.

737
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,280
Losers, Tribal Council, where
somebody will be the 16th

738
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,480
person voted out of Survivor,

739
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,400
become the ninth
member of our jury.

740
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
We'll draw for spots
and we'll get started.

741
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,240
All right, here we go.
For immunity.

742
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,640
Guaranteed spot
in the final four.

743
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,400
Survivors ready?
Go!

744
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,800
Definitely a learning curve
to this challenge.

745
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,880
You're going to be dropping
balls and starting over.

746
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,480
That's part of it.

747
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,320
Sarah working on that first transition.

748
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,520
She's got it.

749
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,560
Culpepper makes that first transition.

750
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,480
Tai is through his first obstacle.

751
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,160
Sarah's through that second obstacle.

752
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,960
Culpepper working around that
second obstacle.

753
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,080
Tai now heading for
the second obstacle.

754
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,520
Tai drops.
He's got to go back.

755
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,240
Sarah navigates
that third obstacle.

756
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,320
Culpepper right at the third obstacle.

757
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,560
Aubry and Troyzan struggling to
get out of the gate.

758
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,840
Culpepper neither
that final obstacle.

759
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,400
Sarah right behind him.

760
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,280
It's Culpepper and Sarah at the
same spot in the challenge.

761
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,320
Culpepper makes the final transition.

762
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,960
Sarah does not.
Sarah has to go back.

763
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,440
Culpepper now very close to the
finish with his first ball.

764
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,360
Culpepper drops and has his
first of three balls.

765
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,840
Culpepper now
knows it is possible.

766
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,600
He can do it.

767
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,480
Tai, Aubry, Troyzan trying to
get something going.

768
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,760
Aubry having no luck at all.

769
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,960
Sarah now at the third obstacle.

770
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,400
Culpepper now at the third obstacle.

771
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,320
But he's on his second ball.

772
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,160
Culpepper navigates it now,
heading into that final obstacle.

773
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,280
Sarah still sitting
on that third obstacle,

774
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,320
ball really moving and it drops.

775
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Sarah once again losing
all of her progress,

776
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,800
has to begin again.

777
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Culpepper very close to
finishing his second ball.

778
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,320
Culpepper has his second ball.
One ball left for immunity.

779
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,480
It would be culpepper's fourth
individual immunity win and

780
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,120
would put him within striking
distance of the Survivor

781
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,560
record, which is five, held by a
very small and elite group.

782
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,000
Troyzan at the fourth
and final obstacle.

783
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,760
He's got to move.

784
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,760
Troyzan drops.

785
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,600
All progress lost.
Has to start again.

786
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,280
Nobody else even close.

787
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,200
Culpepper working his way up
that final obstacle.

788
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,680
Aubry just going to watch now.

789
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,280
It would be a dominating fourth
individual immunity win

790
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,480
within one of the record.

791
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,720
Culpepper wins his fourth
individual immunity!

792
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,520
Guaranteed a spot in the final four!

793
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,760
Culpepper, come on over.

794
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,320
Where is the emotion?

795
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,720
What's happening?

796
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,680
- That one was for her?
- Yeah, yeah.

797
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,560
Fourth individual immunity win.

798
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,800
Culpepper is guaranteed a
spot in the final four.

799
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,640
You will see day 38.

800
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,960
As for everybody else, for
somebody, this is the end.

801
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,360
Tribal Councin tonight.

802
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,600
Somebody will be the 16th
person voted out of this game

803
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,440
and the ninth
member of our jury.

804
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,040
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

805
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,600
See you tonight at tribal.
Congrats.

806
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,480
Thank you.

807
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,720
Brad smoked us all, and the
tough part is Brad doesn't seem

808
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,440
to really want to work with me.

809
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,640
So i feel like i could
be going home.

810
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,720
So i'm going to make
a pitch to save myself, 

811
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,520
but i need the numbers right now.

812
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,560
Nicely done!

813
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,480
I've got one of
those in my house.

814
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,800
Oh, gosh!

815
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,840
I won my fourth individual
immunity today.

816
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,200
Walking into those challenges,
i'm so focused on what i've got

817
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,640
to do that all i think about is
the challenge itself.

818
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,840
Being a part of the
record is a side note.

819
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,560
My eyes are on the prize
and i think i'm really close to

820
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
be able to take the bell.

821
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,920
You're looking kind of
golden right now, buddy.

822
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,640
We want Aubry out, correct?

823
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,400
- Correct
- Okay.

824
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,080
My alliance is solid with
Brad and Sarah is with us as well.

825
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,360
That's a majority.

826
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,240
So we're going to vote out Aubry
next because when it comes to

827
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,360
the final Tribal Council
speeches, Tai is easier to beat.

828
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,680
But you tell me what's
been easy in this game,

829
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,600
and i'll be like this.

830
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,600
This is... zero.

831
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Nothing's been easy.

832
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,600
I think that there are some
very clear things in this game.

833
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,280
Like, if i'm not here tomorrow
and Brad wins immunity again,

834
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,800
you guys have a 50% shot of
making the final three because

835
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,440
he's keeping Troyzan, no matter.

836
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,960
- If we get rid of Troy--
- It maximizes.

837
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,720
We have to pick
between the two of us.

838
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,320
If Brad wins the immunity
challenge tomorrow

839
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,400
he will be taking Troyzan
to the finale with him.

840
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,000
Then Sarah and Tai
each have a 50% shot

841
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
at vying for that final spot.

842
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,600
If, however, we make a move
tonight together to take out

843
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,400
Troyzan, that leaves
two spots open.

844
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,640
I don't want to be
wiped out by the boys.

845
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,480
I agree.

846
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,160
After we have worked together
off and on or whatever.

847
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,760
This is a chance to say, look,
we actually pulled it together

848
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,040
- when it mattered.
- Right.

849
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,480
I agree.

850
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,960
The story of my game
this whole season is

851
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,560
i'm always in the middle.

852
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,160
So i've got a decision
to make tonight.

853
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,760
But first, i need to make sure
that i can trust Tai.

854
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,120
- We're good, right, you and i?
- Well, are we?

855
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,320
Yes, yeah.

856
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,600
Because you were--

857
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,760
If you knew out of
anyone in this entire game

858
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,480
you are the one person they
cared about the whole time.

859
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,840
And that's why i got so hurt.

860
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,720
Tai, i'm telling you, i've
had your back the whole game.

861
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,960
- I know.
- So...

862
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,800
give me what you would
like to do, and i'll tell you if

863
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,200
i think it's a good idea or not.

864
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,520
I think get Aubry out.

865
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,520
Is that what you
want to do, Aubry?

866
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,480
If you want to,
i'm okay with that.

867
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,520
- Are you okay with that?
- Yeah.

868
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,800
I love Aubry as a person.

869
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,960
But she's also
a really good player.

870
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,120
So she's the one who needs to go
home because i can't beat her.

871
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,920
- I'll shake with you right now.
- I'll shake with you.

872
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,360
- We're not going home tonight.
- We're voting out Aubry.

873
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,840
- Okay.
- Perfect.

874
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,400
I control who goes to the final four.

875
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,280
- I do.
- Yes, you do.

876
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,240
I can control who goes to final four.

877
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,280
I give you to tomorrow, you
have to assure me from here on out,

878
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,800
you're voting whatever i vote.

879
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,560
Okay?
It's not complicated.

880
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,520
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you understand that?

881
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,200
- Yes.
- Okay.

882
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,120
- Do you believe that?
- I believe it.

883
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,880
You're very sincere. Every time
you say it, i believe it.

884
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,600
It's not about me.
It's what you believe.

885
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,880
Are you really got have my back
tonight and tomorrow night?

886
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,280
I will have your back tonight
and tomorrow night.

887
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,680
- Yeah.
- Okay.

888
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,840
I'll see what you vote because
i'm going to be here tomorrow.

889
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,000
Brad and i happen to want the
same thing, but the way he

890
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,840
talked to me is, like, i am the
minority or subserveiant or

891
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,880
something.
It's not an equal partnership.

892
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,480
He has no respect for me.

893
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,360
He's intimidating big time to me
because i'm a little guy.

894
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,680
He said if i don't want to go
home tonight, i have to make him

895
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,520
- a promise.
- Okay.

896
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,920
That i vote whatever
he tell me tonight.

897
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,680
And he said i have no choice but
to go with him plans.

898
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,760
I don't take orders from nobody.

899
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,680
- We can flip on him.
- Okay, okay.

900
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,680
And vote Troyzan, we
flip on him tonight.

901
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,000
Tonight is huge.

902
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,680
This could be a million-dollar move.

903
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,760
And sure enough, Tai is
changing his mind

904
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,760
again at the last minute.

905
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,840
Tonight is actually the
biggest vote of the game.

906
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,560
It's going to determine who will
be in the final four.

907
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,400
So Tai and i have to
figure out which way to go.

908
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,600
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.

909
00:48:51,520 --> 00:49:00,640
Hali, Ozzy, Debbie, Zeke,
Sierra, Andrea, Michaela

910
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,720
and Cirie, voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

911
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,920
All right, so let's
get straight into it.

912
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,320
Culpepper's fourth
individual immunity win.

913
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,680
Troyzan, what's the feeling for
you when you see it happening

914
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,000
again and again?

915
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,520
Because we're at the point in
the game now where Culpepper

916
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,720
could win his way to the end.

917
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,240
Yeah, it's tough, you know.

918
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,400
The last time i played,
you know, i felt like

919
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,040
challenges were my deal.

920
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,160
And looking at this guy just
romp through it like it's nothing.

921
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,720
It's tough to see and it's, you
know, i'm hoping that the next

922
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:40,080
challenge, if i'm there, will be
something right down my alley.

923
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,040
Aubry, why are you
smiling during this?

924
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,280
We're talking about Culpepper
dominating, and you're smiling.

925
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,160
I mean, that's Survivor.

926
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,880
Sometimes it's with you,
and sometimes it's not.

927
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,280
Where is it for you tonight?

928
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,800
I'm definitely on the
chopping block.

929
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,240
So, Sarah, what does
the conversation center around

930
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,960
with five people left?

931
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,200
People are just trying to
survive one day at a time right now.

932
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,000
It's kind of where the
conversation circulates is how

933
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,400
do i make it through
tonight's Tribal Council?

934
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,160
So, Troyzan, is everybody
pitching everybody?

935
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,320
Yeah, pretty much, that's how
it goes because this is where

936
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,320
it's critical that you basically
negotiate yourself

937
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,240
into a final three thing.

938
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,760
Aubry, this really is
about final three at this point.

939
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,320
It is.

940
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,280
And you know the social dynamics
and you can make some logical

941
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,840
conclusions about where things
are going, and i believe that

942
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:39,120
Brad and Troyzan will be two of
the spots in the final three if

943
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,520
one of them wins
immunity tomorrow.

944
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,400
So if someone wants to have a
higher chance of going to the

945
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,320
end, there's another way to go.

946
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,760
Which would be voting out Troyzan.
That's only option.

947
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,160
You can't vote out Culpepper.

948
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,560
Yes.

949
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,160
- Tai, did Aubry pitch you this?
- Yeah.

950
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,240
Aubry has talked to me
about it with percentage.

951
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,200
It's interesting argument and
i'm taking that into consideration.

952
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,840
Sarah, what would be
the advantage of going with

953
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,800
Aubry's strategy?

954
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,840
At that point, that's where
you have to start considering

955
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,280
who you're willing to put on the
jury and who you would like to

956
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,120
sit next to.

957
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,920
And what's right for me, what's
right for Aubry, what's right

958
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,520
for Tai could all be the same
thing or they could all be

959
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,520
different things.
I'm not sure.

960
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,280
Troyzan are, you aware
that there's this feeling

961
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,400
that you and
Culpepper are connected?

962
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,320
Not as much as Aubry says
because that's her opinion.

963
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,480
How do you know... i don't win
immunity and there's two spots

964
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,000
left with me.
So, hello.

965
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,520
Culpepper, just because
you have immunity today

966
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,960
doesn't mean you can sit on your
hands because you have to make

967
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,800
sure that if you don't win the
next challenge, you've got a shot.

968
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,800
Absolutely.

969
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,720
I mean, i've talked to everybody
just like everybody else talked

970
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,760
to everybody else.

971
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,960
But from what i'm hearing
tonight sounds like i have to

972
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,080
win to get in.

973
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,960
Culpepper, are there
people in the game for you think

974
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,720
if i go to the end with them,
i'm not sure i could win?

975
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,440
Yes.

976
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,520
How about you, Sarah, people
you are concerned you can't beat?

977
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,240
- Absolutely.
- Tai.

978
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,000
- Yup, definitely.
- How about you, Aubry?

979
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah, there are people i
think i can't beat.

980
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,880
- Troyzan.
- No.

981
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,280
- So you feel confident.
- Yes.

982
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,040
Wow.

983
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,200
Sarah, it is interesting
that Aubry's case is

984
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,480
against Troyzan, and Troyzan is
the one guy that says:

985
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,840
"I can beat anybody
here in this game."

986
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,240
You know, if Troyzan feels he
can beat everybody here,

987
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,520
then maybe he's not
someone i want to go with.

988
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,720
So if it's about a final three
right now tonight,

989
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,080
then you better pick
the right final three.

990
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,000
All right, it is time to vote.
Aubry, you're up.

991
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,640
I'll go tally the votes.

992
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,600
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,

993
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,400
now would be the time to do so.

994
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,640
Okay, once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

995
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,120
Person voted out will be asked
to leave the tribal council area inmediately.

996
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,440
I'll read the votes.

997
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,800
First vote...

998
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,520
Aubry.

999
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,040
Troyzan.
One vote Aubry, one vote Troyzan.

1000
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,720
Aubry.

1001
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,160
Two votes Aubry,
one vote Troyzan.

1002
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,480
16th person voted out and
the ninth member of our jury: Aubry.

1003
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,880
That's three, that's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

1004
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,840
Aubry, the tribe has spoken.

1005
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,560
You can leave it here.

1006
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,320
Well, you've made it
to the final four.

1007
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,120
Tomorrow, you will compete in
your final immunity challenge.

1008
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,560
You are this close.

1009
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,320
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

1010
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,440
Good night.

1011
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,600
I decide to not be cagey and
go for broke in Tribal, but

1012
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,920
Survivor has taught me you
can't control everything, and i

1013
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,960
gave it my best shot.

1014
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,400
And i took everything that i
could from the experience.

1015
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,040
I'm so excited to be on the jury.

1016
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,960
I''m so freaking excited to
watch these psychopaths.

1017
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,200
Come on in, guys!

1018
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,560
All right, you guys
ready to get to your final

1019
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,320
- inmmunity challenge?
- Yes.

1020
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,360
First things first,
Culpepper, for the fourth time,

1021
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,520
i will take it back.

1022
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,320
For the last time, immunity
is back up for grabs.

1023
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,160
For today's challenge, you're
going to race through an

1024
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,200
obstacle and down a giant water
slide collecting bags of puzzle

1025
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,120
pieces as you go.

1026
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,360
Once you have all three bags,
you'll use the pieces inside to

1027
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,040
solve a lighthouse puzzle.

1028
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,040
First to finish guarantees
themselves a spot at that final

1029
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,080
Tribal Council.

1030
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:20,000
Losers, one of you will be the
17th person voted out and

1031
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,720
the tenth and final
member of our jury.

1032
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,320
This is the biggest
challenge of the game.

1033
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,040
Win, you go to the end.
Lose, you may not.

1034
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,960
We'll draw for spots.
We'll get started.

1035
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,160
Good luck.

1036
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,720
All right, here we go.

1037
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,000
Final immunity, guaranteed a
spot at that Final Tribal Council.

1038
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,640
Survivors ready?

1039
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,360
Go!

1040
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,920
First job, untie those knots,
get that for us ring of keys and

1041
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,720
head through the obstacle.

1042
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,400
Who will be out
of the gate first?

1043
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,800
It is Culpepper.
Then Sarah.

1044
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Then Tai and Troyzan.

1045
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,520
Got to make your way through
that first obstacle.

1046
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,840
Halfway through, you're going to
get your first bag of pieces and

1047
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,640
you've got multiple keys.

1048
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,080
You need a little luck right
here to find the right one as

1049
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,440
fast as possible.

1050
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,400
Sarah has her first bag.

1051
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,280

00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,240

her second set of keys.

1056
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,880
Troyzan heading back out.

1057
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,440
Culpepper and Tai side by side
with their first bags,

1058
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,920
down the pole they go.

1059
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,120
Get them on the
table and head out!

1060
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,480
It is Sarah up the slide first.

1061
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,040
You have to untie
that second set of keys.

1062
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,360
Sarah has it, down the slide.

1063
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,240
That's how you do it!

1064
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,680
Culpepper has his
second set of keys.

1065
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,200

Troyzan has his keys.

1067
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,840
He's headed down.

1068
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,280
Culpepper heading down now with
his second set of keys.

1069
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,760
Here comes Tai!

1070
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,480
Sarah releases her second
bag, still in the lead.

1071
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,480
Troyzan at his second bag.

1072
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,840
Culpepper is at his second bag.
Tai at his second bag.

1073
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,280
Everybody trying keys now as
Sarah extends her lead.

1074
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,880
Culpepper's got his
second set heading down.

1075
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,760
Troyzan still working
on his second set.

1076
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,040
Tai has his second
set of puzzle pieces.

1077
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,400
He's heading down.

1078
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,720
Sarah has her third
and final set of keys.

1079
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,400
Tai heading up now.

1080
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,880
Troyzan still trying to
release that second set.

1081
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,600
He is losing a lot of time.

1082
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,960
Sarah in the lead.
Culpepper in second.

1083
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,080
Then Tai.

1084
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,960
Here comes Culpepper.

1085
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,680
He's good to go heading through
the obstacle for the final time.

1086
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,720
Tai has his third set of keys.

1087
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,720
Troyzan finally has
his second bag.

1088
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,920
Sarah now working on her third
and final bag of puzzle pieces.

1089
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,680
Culpepper right behind her.
Here comes Troyzan.

1090
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,400
Trying to get back in this.

1091
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,480
Tai now heading
for his third bag.

1092
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,680
Culpepper gets his quickly!
It is now Culpepper in the lead.

1093
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,440
Sarah taking a long time,
has lost her lead.

1094
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,480
Sarah now has her third bag.

1095
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,120
It is Culpepper and Sarah now
working on their puzzle.

1096
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,960
Tai has his third bag.

1097
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,560
Troyzan has his third and final
set of keys!, let's go!

1098
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,800
It is Tai, Culpepper and Sarah.

1099
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,520
Troyzan needs to get lucky
quickly and find the right key

1100
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,400
fast if he's going to be in this.

1101
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,080
Final immunity challenge, all
the marbles, right here.

1102
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,240
Troyzan has his third bag.

1103
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,800
He's back in this!

1104
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,240
Everybody is in this.

1105
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,800
This is what you want in the
final challenge of Survivor,

1106
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,400
everybody competing for the win.

1107
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,160
Tai has his first piece.

1108
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,880
Culpepper has his first piece.

1109
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,520
Culpepper has his second piece.

1110
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,320
Troyzan looking for the first
piece, and he's got it.

1111
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,360
Culpepper with the third piece.

1112
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,320
Sarah just looking
to get on the board.

1113
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,880
Culpepper with his fourth piece.

1114
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,320
Tai with his second piece.

1115
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,880
Culpepper with his fifth piece.

1116
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,280
He took the lead at the very end

1117
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,880
and does not want
to give it up now.

1118
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,080
Tai with the third piece.

1119
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,520
Sarah still struggling.

1120
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,320
Now he's got one as
Culpepper adds another.

1121
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,200
Tai with his fourth piece.

1122
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,360
Sarah adds a piece.

1123
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,680
Culpepper down to his last piece.

1124
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,760
He just needs the top.

1125
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,440
Now you've got to untie your
three number tiles and use them

1126
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,040
to solve a combination lock.

1127
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,600
That holds the top of the
lighthouse, so you are close,

1128
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,120
but not there yet.

1129
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,200
Tai with a fifth piece.

1130
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,800
Tai is the only one who has a
shot right now at catching Culpepper.

1131
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,320
Culpepper has it.
He's got the top!

1132
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,280
For the win.

1133
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,360
Culpepper wins his fifth
individual immunity,

1134
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,080
guaranteed a spot
at the Final Tribal Council!

1135
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,400
Where he will get a chance to
plead his case for the million

1136
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,960
dollars and the title
of Sole Survivor.

1137
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,960
Culpepper, come on over.

1138
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,680
Hello, my old friend.

1139
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,320
Once again, immunity is yours.

1140
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,840
A couple of significant things.

1141
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,200
With this win, you join a very
small group of people who have

1142
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,080
won five individual immunity
challenges in a single season.

1143
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,760
The bigger news, with this win,
you are guaranteed a spot at

1144
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,560
the Final Tribal.

1145
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,360
One big decision left in this
game, who will go to the final

1146
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,600
three with you, and who will
become the tenth and final

1147
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,760
member of our jury, their
dream falling this short.

1148
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,240
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

1149
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,480
See you guys at Tribal.
Congrats.

1150
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,240
After winning five immunity
challenges i'm clearly in

1151
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,200
control of this game.

1152
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,760
I'm in the final three, and
quite frankly, i think i can

1153
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,160
beat every single one of them
but as for tonight, Tai has

1154
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,280
betrayed me this entire game
and so he's going home

1155
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,760
and it's good to be the king.

1156
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,040
Dude!

1157
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,120
- Oh, my god.
- You did it.

1158
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,080
He did a lot better than i
thought he would.

1159
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,160
I know.

1160
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,280
I knew i was going to win
that challenge.

1161
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,600
I was so prepared mentally, that
in my head i had already won it

1162
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,560
before i started.

1163
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,880
and this necklace makes me
Superman, makes me bulletproof.

1164
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,640
I'm going to the final three and
it's my decision who is going

1165
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,000
home and it comes down to who
has done me wrong the most.

1166
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,280
And that would be Tai.

1167
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,160
- Just let him down easy.
- No, no.

1168
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,680
- No?
- No.

1169
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,200
- It's my island right now.
- Okay, okay.

1170
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,160
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- I know, i know.

1171
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,720
But i'd rather him think he's
got some glimmer of hope,

1172
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,440
and i'm going to let
him down at Tribal.

1173
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,640
He's done nothing but backstab
me this whole game.

1174
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,080
I said: "buddy, give me an idol
and we'll go to the end."

1175
01:03:59,200 --> 01:03:59,680
Right.

1176
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,640
He did not give me the idol.
He played the idol.

1177
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,400
Were you going to fulfill that?, no.

1178
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,160
- No.
- Okay.

1179
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,400
You're going in
and Sarah is going in.

1180
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,360
As far as jury is concerned,
after winning five immunity

1181
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,400
challenges, i know i can beat
both Troyzan and Sarah, because

1182
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,400
after football, i became a trial
attorney, so i think i can sell

1183
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,480
my case better to the jury.

1184
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,400
So i'm in control, and Tai is going
to get what he deserves.

1185
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,360
I know.
One of us is going home.

1186
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,440
Yeah.

1187
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:40,600
Right now, i think the most
obvious, logical conclusion is

1188
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,160
Brad will vote me out for
betraying himself so many times

1189
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,440
and now my life's on the line.

1190
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,720
- It's whoever those who vote for.
- Yeah.

1191
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,600
How?

1192
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,480
And we both go to final together.

1193
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,280
Brad and Troyzan have been
tight the entire game, so,

1194
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,680
clearly, they're going to make a
move against me or Tai.

1195
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,520
So he said let's vote for
Troyzan, and force a tie, which

1196
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,520
would come down to
a fire-making challenge.

1197
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,160
I have to consider it.

1198
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,560
Even though it scares
the crap out of me.

1199
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,440
I'm not super good at fire.

1200
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,720
I don't think Troyzan is very
good at making fire.

1201
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,560
- Yeah, probably not.
- No.

1202
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,880
I think we can do it.

1203
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,640
Brad's pretty cocky right now
and thinks he's calling the shots.

1204
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,760
But i'm thinking, screw that.

1205
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,000
If i can win a fire-making
challenge, i can decide who's

1206
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,440
going to the final three.

1207
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,480
The jury hates me, they do.
Because i appear like a liar.

1208
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,320
Yeah.

1209
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,720
Tai's telling me that he can't win.

1210
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,480
But he's made moves and found
three idols, so he has a resume.

1211
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,160
However, Tai is so all
over the place,

1212
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,560
he might have alienated the jury.

1213
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,480
And then there's Troyzan, who
hasn't done anything without

1214
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,480
Brad's permission
this whole game.

1215
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,880
But at the same time,
he hasn't made anyone mad.

1216
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,680
And Sandra won twice by not
making anyone mad.

1217
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,160
How do you start... like,
what do you need to do?

1218
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,600
- Okay.
- Watch the wind.

1219
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,240
I think i can do it.

1220
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:38,000
If i do this and win, i could
rack up a ton of points with the jury.

1221
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,240
But i have to decide if this is
a risk that i'm willing to take.

1222
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,840
It's a coin flip, and i've got
to pick heads or tails.

1223
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,760
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.

1224
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:13,680
Hali, Ozzy, Debbie, Zeke,
Sierra, Andrea, Michaela, Cirie

1225
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,000
and Aubry, voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

1226
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,240
All right, so, last big decision
to be made by you guys tonight,

1227
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,160
who you're going to send over to
that jury and which three will

1228
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,560
get to face the jury.

1229
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,600
Culpepper, first, congratulations.

1230
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,960
Your fifth individual immunity win.

1231
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,800
Tell me about the moment
right after you won it.

1232
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,920
It's an amazing feeling
when it happened.

1233
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,960
I know i'm guaranteed a 39 day.

1234
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,960
But now i've got to figure out
who we want to put on the jury,

1235
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,880
so it's that could affect tomorrow's
vote and everything else.

1236
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,800
Sarah when Culpepper says:
"now we have to decide who

1237
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
to put on the jury,"
who is the "we"?

1238
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:59,680
I think he's implying himself
and Troyzan, which would leave

1239
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,680
Tai and myself on
the chopping block.

1240
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,520
Tai, does that ring true?

1241
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:07,440
That's absolutely true that
Sarah and i are at the bottom.

1242
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,120
One of us is going
to go home tonight.

1243
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,640
But if we work together,
our chance might go up.

1244
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,160
Because we, obviously, can't
vote for Culpepper.

1245
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,320
And if we join forces we
can vote for Troyzan.

1246
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,920
- And force a tie.
- Force a tie.

1247
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,880
So, Sarah, did you
guys talk about it?

1248
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:25,760
Yeah.

1249
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,400
That's exactly what could
happen tonight.

1250
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,840
Where do you sit with that?

1251
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,400
Because you're weighing a lot?

1252
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:36,360
For me, personally, my decision
is going to come from who

1253
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,840
do i want to sit
with in a final three?

1254
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,520
But both of us get to the
final three, you know.

1255
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,240
If i was Sarah, i would say,
well, you cannot be absolute sure.

1256
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,400
I mean, Culpepper told me if i
gave him one of my idols for him

1257
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,120
to hold on to, they
could buy back his trust.

1258
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:58,080
I mean, he just
thinks like i'm so naive.

1259
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,720
I'm like i have a brain.
It's common sense.

1260
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,920
But you have no leverage.
I've got the necklace.

1261
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,640
You're in the minority.
I'm giving you an opportunity.

1262
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,960
I'm throwing you a lifeline,
but nothing's for free.

1263
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,040
That's fine.

1264
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,920
But you treating me like a
little child, like a little

1265
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,960
simpleton, "give me the idol."

1266
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,160
I don't need that.

1267
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,200
I decide on my own
term how my destination is.

1268
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,760
Troyzan, the tough
part about tonight for you is

1269
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:30,200
you have no idea if that is the
truth or part of a scheme to

1270
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,760
make somebody else feel safe
when they're not.

1271
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:39,160
Well, yeah, this is the first
news i have of a tie happening.

1272
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,600
And it seems like every day,
every hour, there's been

1273
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,760
something crazy happen.

1274
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:49,240
So it wouldn't be out of the
normal for me to go, "wow"

1275
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,720
again, and say,
"okay, here we go.

1276
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,040
break out the sticks,
and let's build a fire."

1277
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,320
Brad, this is not a
revolutionary idea to think about

1278
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,640
forcing a tie if
you think two are tight.

1279
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,560
This is basic Survivor strategy.

1280
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,120
We can up our odds by forcing
a tie and going to fire.

1281
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,280
Absolutely, if they both feel
uncomfortable, they can

1282
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,200
absolutely do that.

1283
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,640
Tai, how do you feel about this?

1284
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,080
There's some doubt.

1285
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:19,960
There's got to be, that they're
voting for you, not for me.

1286
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,320
Whatever they're telling you,
who knows if it's true or not.

1287
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:27,400
Troyzan, it's one
simple vote to get to the end,

1288
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,200
but there are all these
possibilities.

1289
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,560
It's never a simple vote, Jeff.

1290
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,960
So i'm going to put my trust in
myself because i'm trusting my

1291
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,360
intuition, and if it's right,
i'll walk out of here a final

1292
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:47,000
three guy. If i'm not, i'm
building a fire tonight.

1293
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,360
All right, Sarah,
Tai, Troyzan, one of you is

1294
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,320
about to be the tenth and
final member of our jury.

1295
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,600
It is time to vote.
Troyzan, you're up.

1296
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,480
This is the hardest name that
i've had to write down this season.

1297
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,400
I'll go tally the votes.

1298
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,960
Once the votes are read
the decision is final.

1299
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,880
Person voted out will be asked
to leave the Tribal Council

1300
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,880
area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

1301
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,240
First vote...

1302
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,600
Tai.

1303
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,840
Troyzan.

1304
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,840
Tai.

1305
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,160
That's two votes Tai, one vote Troyzan,
one vote left.

1306
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,120
17th person voted out and
the final member of our jury: Tai.

1307
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,480
You need to bring me your torch.

1308
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,160
Tai, the tribe has spoken.

1309
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,320
Thank you, Jeff for a great season.

1310
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,040
- Thank you for coming back.
- Appreciate it.

1311
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,040
Time for you to go.

1312
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,680
Congratulations, you made it
to the final three.

1313
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,040
You have one more night
in beautiful Fiji.

1314
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,080
We'll see you here tomorrow
night for your final Tribal Council.

1315
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,400
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

1316
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,680
Good night.

1317
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,520
I would like to be on the final
three and possibly could have won.

1318
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,040
I mean, i did a lot, idol, made
a couple of big moves, socially,

1319
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,160
people liked me.

1320
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,320
I mean, this is a
really tough game.

1321
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,880
But i bounced back, and i'll
just grow stronger.

1322
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,560
39, baby.

1323
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,360
39 days.

1324
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,280
Who would have thunk it?

1325
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:39,480
This was a dream they truly put
out there 16 years ago when i

1326
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,760
watched the first episode.

1327
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,120
I'm like: "i want to
be the Sole Survivor."

1328
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,680
And to get to the three
almost feels like i'm there.

1329
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,920
- Are you crying?
- Yeah.

1330
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,120
No... it's the smoke.

1331
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,440
My social game was real.

1332
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,520
I have the ability to speak to
people openly, and i worked that

1333
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,520
angle from the
bottom to the middle

1334
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,120
to the top the whole game.

1335
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,480
I think that's what helped me
because people did trust me,

1336
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,760
never wrote my name
down, and i got to day 39.

1337
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,000
Maybe this season your
personality, your loyalty, your

1338
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,240
game play from the inside
maybe will count more.

1339
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,520
And i got a good
feeling about this.

1340
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,960
Holy mackerel.

1341
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,400
Three baskets.

1342
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,600
Oh, look at the muffins.

1343
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,080
Look at that, guys.
Well-deserved meal.

1344
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,480
- Final three.
- Final three.

1345
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,280
Way to go.

1346
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,320
Knowing that i'm the final three

1347
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,840
is the best feeling in the world.

1348
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,080
It's what you
dream of when Jeff

1349
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,440
says the word "go" on day one.

1350
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,440
I worked my butt
off to get here.

1351
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,040
I made moves that other people
were scared to make.

1352
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,200
I made moves that
i was scared to make.

1353
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,720
And i'm very proud
of how i played.

1354
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,560
Brad, are you even
nervous about tonight?

1355
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,440
Not really.

1356
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,160
As a police officer, i don't
respect being lied to.

1357
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,880
It makes me feel like
you think that i'm stupid.

1358
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,680
But i'm the criminal tonight.

1359
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,360
And those people on the jury
are the police officers.

1360
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,160
So if they're asking for the
truth, i'm going to give them

1361
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,480
the truth because i reward honesty.

1362
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,400
I hope they reward
my honesty tonight.

1363
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,800
The whole day i've been thinking
about, okay, what have i done?

1364
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,960
And i feel that i'm in a good
position because i've been a

1365
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,720
game changer and maneuvered my
way to where i controlled my

1366
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,720
destiny this entire game.

1367
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,680
I've won five immunity challenges.

1368
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,760
I put myself here.
I wasn't drug here.

1369
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:38,880
I did it on my own.

1370
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,080
And i brought the people
i want with me here.

1371
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,800
I don't need the money, but i
desperately want to win.

1372
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,920
Winning the game of Survivor
means everything to me.

1373
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,240
And i can argue my case at the
end of the day and walk out of

1374
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,160
trial thinking
i've got it, slam dunk.

1375
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,640
But quite frankly, i have
not been in a trial

1376
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,320
for a million-dollar case.

1377
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,000
I'm kind of in a trial for a
million-dollar case tonight.

1378
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,440
We'll now bring in your jury.

1379
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:37,400
Hali, Ozzy, Debbie, Zeke,
Sierra, Andrea, Michaela, Cirie, Aubry

1380
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,960
and Tai, voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

1381
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:49,600
So welcome to the final Tribal
Council of Survivor: Game Changers.

1382
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,120
It has been a
season full of firsts.

1383
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,600
Most idols ever played
at one Tribal: three.

1384
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,520
Most people ever
safe at one Tribal: five.

1385
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,160
First person in Cirie ever voted
out simply because there was no

1386
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,160
one else to vote for.

1387
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,400
First time the steal a vote was
played effectively when Sarah

1388
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,000
used it to knock out Michaela.

1389
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,720
Culpepper with five individual
immunity wins joins a very elite

1390
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,360
group that includes Ozzy.

1391
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:20,400
We also have a new leader in
most days played on Survivor,

1392
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,080
Ozzy at 128 days.

1393
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,080
Followed right
behind with Cirie, at 121.

1394
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,480
Nice!

1395
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,480
Congratulations.

1396
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,840
So given that this is
Survivor: Game Changers, and

1397
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:37,880
that there have been so many
firsts, it seems only

1398
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,480
appropriate that we
end with another first.

1399
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,240
We're change Tribal
Council up this year.

1400
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,960
In a way that will allow for a
more open discussion between the

1401
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,440
jury and the final three.

1402
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,400
We're going to center it around
the three aspects of the game:

1403
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,560
Outwit, outplay, outlast.

1404
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,240
Outwit would be the social part
of the game, the emotional

1405
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,040
intelligence, your alliances,
relationships you had outside of

1406
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:02,760
those alliances.

1407
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,760
The outplay portion would be how
you respond to the conditions

1408
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,760
put on you by the game.

1409
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,160
You have to build shelter.

1410
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,160
You have to compete in challenges.

1411
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,320
There are switches.
There will be twists.

1412
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,520
How do you respond to
the hand you're dealt?

1413
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,080
And the final phase, outlast.
Most critical.

1414
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,960
Did you put people on the jury
who respect the we you outwitted

1415
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,040
and outplayed more
than the other two?

1416
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,120
And if not, tonight is your
last chance to sway them.

1417
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,360
I'm going to give you
a moment to take it in.

1418
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,800
We'll get started.

1419
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,320
All right, let's start with the
outwit portion of the game,

1420
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,240
the social part of Survivor.

1421
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,680
Who wants to address Sarah,
Brad, or Troyzan first?

1422
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,040
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

1423
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:58,000
Sarah, on day three of this
game, i gave you my jacket.

1424
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,760
And then i was blindsided, and
every night, you wore my jacket

1425
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,920
to Tribal Council.

1426
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:08,320
And all i could think was:
"hot damn!, that is bad ass."

1427
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,280
You made such amazing
relationships.

1428
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:15,760
Sierra, whom you were
responsible for voting out, gave

1429
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,920
you the legacy advantage because
she didn't process that you were

1430
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,680
responsible for
controlling this game.

1431
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,400
So, Sarah, i am your
champion tonight.

1432
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,400
- And i wish you the best.
- Thank you.

1433
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,800
I am going to say, i'm in
such a dilemma here.

1434
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,040
So, you know, Sarah, you had
some brilliant game moves, really.

1435
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,120
Like, you convinced everyone
here that they were your best friend.

1436
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,520
And you brought people's
personal feel into emotions.

1437
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,520
And i feel... i feel kind of gross.

1438
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,840
Did you know that you were going
to have this effect on people?

1439
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,360
Yes, on one side, i can respect,
hey, she fooled us all.

1440
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,440
But am i going to feel good
about that vote?

1441
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:02,040
I want everyone over there to
know, my personal relationships

1442
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:05,560
were 100% real from
the bottom of my heart.

1443
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,280
Well, i'm just trying to be honest.

1444
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:12,280
I think the problem is why
should we trust what you're

1445
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,280
saying to us right now?

1446
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:18,960
Look, i played this game, as we
found out, more than anybody else.

1447
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,360
There is a way to
play this game without

1448
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,080
going as low as you had to go.

1449
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,760
Yeah, i lied.

1450
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,720
But it's what i
had to do sit here,

1451
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,080
and i was willing to
do whatever it took.

1452
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,640
Then again, somebody like
Brad, who as a competitor,

1453
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,640
i give you props.

1454
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:41,480
You get put into a position
where you've got to win, win,

1455
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,320
win, win, win.
And nobody,

1456
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,400
very few people, you and i
and a few other people

1457
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,400
understand how hard that is.

1458
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,920
And he didn't have to
get his hands dirty.

1459
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,360
He could do it in a way that was
more clean and more loyal.

1460
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,400
So i will be Brad's
champion at this point.

1461
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,720
Cirie, social part of
the game, outwit.

1462
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,040
What's on your mind?

1463
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:08,080
Brad, most of us sitting here
voted Sierra out because we knew

1464
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,080
she was the brains of your
operation and that without her,

1465
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:14,160
you and Troyzan probably would
have just bumped into each other.

1466
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,000
Explain how she didn't run the
first portion of your game.

1467
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,080
When i landed on the beach, i
started working with people,

1468
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,160
with Tai, with Sierra.

1469
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,240
Most importantly, with J.T.

1470
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:28,920
I was able to make the
game-changing, i think, move of

1471
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,680
the season, when we ended up
going to Tribal Council

1472
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,320
with two groups.

1473
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,720
But i had built such a good
relationship with J.T., that he

1474
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,760
came to me in the middle of the
whole Tribal Council and told me

1475
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,400
exactly who they were voting out,

1476
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,920
and i saved Sierra that night.

1477
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,920
And i'm calling it the turning
point of the game because i got

1478
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,800
rid of malcolm, and we all might
not be here if Malcolm were here.

1479
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,720
I'll put in an opinion.

1480
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,880
From the outside looking in, it
did look like Sierra was the

1481
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,440
brains of the operation.

1482
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,680
But considering that this is a
social game built on

1483
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,840
relationships, i'm
interested to know

1484
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,880
how much you actually
know about me.

1485
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,920
Well, you're from Texas.
You went to Texas christian.

1486
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,520
You have... you work with a sales
company for vacations.

1487
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,880
I mean...

1488
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,160
What...what do you
want to know, you know?

1489
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,560
No further questions.

1490
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,680
Ah... then...

1491
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,120
I mean, Brad, that's maybe
where you were lacking.

1492
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,360
I mean, Sarah, even though a lot
of us feel gross about it

1493
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,400
she developed
personal relationships.

1494
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,760
However, Sarah, i'm actually just
curious how did you it.

1495
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,360
How did you manage people's
personal feelings and emotions?

1496
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:42,720
Sarah, before you answer
that, i'm shocked to learn that...

1497
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,960
Because what i had with you
was... i thought was real.

1498
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,280
Now coming from your mouth.

1499
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,040
We all had the same
experience with you.

1500
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,480
- So tell me...
- Well...

1501
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,960
my first season, i played
who i was in real life.

1502
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,880
And that got Sarah nowhere.

1503
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,480
And my support systems at home
basically gave me the permission

1504
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:11,480
to open the floodgates and
do whatever i needed.

1505
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,960
But i think what Andrea is
asking is not for a generality.

1506
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,520
What specifically allows you to
say, "this is real Sarah.

1507
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,520
this is game Sarah?"

1508
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,800
Honestly, it comes from being
a police officer for the last 10 years,

1509
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,360
working under cover.

1510
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,720
When you're under cover,
you have to shut off

1511
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,800
who are you and be someone else.

1512
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,160
You're buying drugs,
you're a drug user now.

1513
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,120
If you're a prostitute,
you're a prostitute.

1514
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,480
I have to play a role
of someone i am not.

1515
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,680
And i get what you're saying
that it's scary how it shuts on

1516
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,280
and off, but i have to
do that for a living.

1517
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,760
But, you know, if the ends
don't justify the means,

1518
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,440
then what does?

1519
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,040
Think Machiavelli the prince,
think Lady Mcbeth.

1520
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:59,360
You know you want to win this
game and you do it at all costs.

1521
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:04,360
I have zero respect for you and
your game play, and that's why i

1522
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,560
am his lieutenant in arms for
you, Brad, because she never

1523
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,960
would have been sitting
there without you.

1524
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,680
Michaela, you have a
look on your face to Debbie's comment.

1525
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:17,920
I guess i don't understand
the emotional feeling that

1526
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,720
people have towards Sarah.

1527
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:24,040
Like, even when Sarah used the
advantage to vote me out, it

1528
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,760
wasn't something
they took personally.

1529
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,200
I was just, like, good thing you
got rid of me, because i'm the

1530
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,360
only one that could beat Brad.

1531
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,480
However, i did want to ask a
question of Troyzan.

1532
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,080
Wow!

1533
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,720
What can you tell the jury
what you actually did from a

1534
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,680
social perspective in this game?

1535
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,640
Well, you know, i've talked
to every single one of you, and

1536
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:45,080
i had personal relationships.

1537
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,520
And i was ready to have an
alliance with all of you, if

1538
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,120
that was to my benefit.

1539
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,520
But it was difficult for me to
play full out because i felt like

1540
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,240
i was playing with, like,
two loved ones.

1541
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,480
Hold on, hold on.

1542
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,280
From my standpoint, there's a
difference between being a

1543
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,800
passenger and being a driver.

1544
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,120
I'm sitting here, though.
I'm sitting here.

1545
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,840
- And you're sitting there.
- For sure.

1546
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,600
- What's the difference.
- For sure.

1547
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,480
I made moves, so basically
help my game.

1548
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,120
When i got to the merge, i got
together with six people that they

1549
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,120
knew i could trust at that point.

1550
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,120
And if they wanted
to vote you out,

1551
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,360
of course, i'm
going to do that.

1552
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,720
But you said "they" wanted to.

1553
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,360
You didn't say "i" wanted to.

1554
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,400
So then you were a
passenger like he's saying.

1555
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:26,560
Yeah, Troyzan, in terms of
the decision making what, role

1556
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,000
did you play in that?

1557
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,120
Well, it wasn't as direct to
say: "this is the person.

1558
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:31,800
That's the person."

1559
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,080
I did things in a sense more
sneaky and made suggestions--

1560
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,640
I'm hearing it's a little bit
of can "anyone but me."

1561
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,080
A little bit Sandra
without the fat.

1562
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:44,200
It's a little bit "anyone but
me"but i can make moves from the

1563
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,200
the middle or the
bottom just as easy.

1564
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,880
It sounds like you're sitting
in the right place.

1565
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,840
But i just want to say people who
didn't get in an alliance didn't

1566
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,560
get to see the way he played.

1567
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,560
You were a part of votes.

1568
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,320
You just did it in
a more subtle way.

1569
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,680
- Thank you.
- Own it, it's not done yet.

1570
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:02,840
Thank you.

1571
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,120
Andrea, weigh in on
Culpepper's social part of the

1572
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,440
game, the outwit portion.

1573
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,240
Okay, Brad, you played a
pretty solid game.

1574
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,560
You were loyal.
You won a bunch of immunities.

1575
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,880
But you never reached out and
tried to form relationships with

1576
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,560
people on the bottom, people
like Michaela, and you were very

1577
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,240
nasty towards people like Tai.

1578
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,280
So i would love to hear your
thoughts on that.

1579
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,920
As far as Michaela, for
whatever reason, Michaela and i

1580
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,880
were oil and water.
I don't know why.

1581
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,560
You and i just didn't connect.

1582
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,640
And you talk about Tai,
basically, i must have been

1583
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,520
doing something right socially

1584
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,040
because you told
you have two idols.

1585
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,880
So i was trying to do everything
i could to make you

1586
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,840
uncomfortable to make you either
give me an idol so i could

1587
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,440
protect you or you
played both your idols.

1588
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,040
I think...

1589
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,240
Do you realize how
you talk to people?

1590
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,000
Do you realize the way you
approached talking to me

1591
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,040
time after time after time saying:

1592
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:59,600
"i control you or
you go home next."

1593
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,560
- I said, "no, why--"
- I understand.

1594
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:05,240
You realize that's how you
came across to me?

1595
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,320
You made a choice to go with
the girls and not stay with the

1596
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,680
alliance i tried to make
and that's fine.

1597
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:14,280
After that i gained power
winning immunities

1598
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:19,440
and i was trying to use this power to
manipulate you and your idols.

1599
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:24,480
So, Brad, did you just say
you used condescension as a

1600
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,320
strategy to control Tai?

1601
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,880
I didn't say i condescend.
I said: "this is an option i'm giving you"

1602
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,920
That was a choice.

1603
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,360
I was simply trying to make a
deal, but it came with a price.

1604
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,840
And the price was the idol.

1605
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,760
Debbie, your opinion about
Culpepper's social part of the game.

1606
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,760
Well, i've got three brothers.

1607
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,120
I'm surrounded by
people in the military.

1608
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:47,960
I understand your testosterone
level is 100 times the average male.

1609
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:52,080
I do get that you are not the
warmest, fuzziest, cuddliest

1610
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,560
teddy bear.

1611
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,720
Love you, anyway.

1612
01:27:54,720 --> 01:28:00,400
But to be honest, like, this
game, this ship, had one driver.

1613
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,840
And that was Sarah.

1614
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,720
Sarah always voted the right way.

1615
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,320
Because Sarah always knew the
right way to vote.

1616
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,680
Because Sarah was always
directing the right way to vote.

1617
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,600
I just want to throw it out there.

1618
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,040
i mean, this is so rich and so
informative and helpful.

1619
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:20,400
And my mind is even less made up
now in a great way than when i

1620
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,240
stormed into this Tribal Council.

1621
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,200
All right, so, clearly, there are
varying opinions about each of you

1622
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,480
in terms of the social
part of Survivor.

1623
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,680
Let's move into the outplay
portion of the same game.

1624
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,120
You have to make shelter,
compete in challenges,

1625
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,520
switches and advantages.

1626
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,760
Anyone have anything they
want to say at the top?

1627
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,040
Brad the outplay
portion goes to you.

1628
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,640
You never stopped working.

1629
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,920
If you haven't won immunity the
last five times, the chances of

1630
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,520
him sitting there probably zero.

1631
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:55,080
He took a risk playing in a way
i respect, and a lot of you

1632
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,480
guys will never know what this
means because you brutalize your

1633
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,360
body to get to this point.

1634
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,960
I failed every single
time i've played.

1635
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,400
I've not been able to do it.

1636
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,560
And i think that
this man, he did it.

1637
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,000
And i think he deserves to win
because he relied on himself

1638
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,440
when he needed to.

1639
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,840
We are the authors of our destiny.

1640
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,560
We are the authors
of our story in this game.

1641
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:18,480
And Brad played from the very
beginning to win this game,

1642
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,760
that's what he did.

1643
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,480
Debbie, how much value
do you give to camp life

1644
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,680
and providing?

1645
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,640
Does it weigh in on your vote?

1646
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:33,160
To me, Survivor has always
been "the lord of the flies."

1647
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,880
And i agree with Ozzy
completely.

1648
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,320
I know it's your make up.
It's your character.

1649
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:44,040
It's your very nature to say:
"this is what has to be done."

1650
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:47,880
They would not be sitting
there without you, sir.

1651
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,720
Thank you, thank you, Ozzy, too.

1652
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:50,520
Thank you both.

1653
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,040
I mean, as far as the outplay,

1654
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,360
Brad's a professional athlete, people.

1655
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,720
I'm 47, i was.

1656
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,880
I'm just making a point.
He's a professional athlete.

1657
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,720
But, the puzzles
are not athletic...

1658
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,480
- Let her finish the statement, please.
- Here's the thing.

1659
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,560
I'm not trying to take anything
away from Brad at all.

1660
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,240
Winning five immunitys is tough.

1661
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:14,280
But what i had to
rely on was my tools

1662
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,000
that i had in the outplay department.

1663
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,560
Sierra tells me in the event she
gets voted out she will will her

1664
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,560
Legacy Advantage to me.

1665
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,320
So now i need to get Sierra out.

1666
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,360
But how am i going
to vote her out

1667
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,880
and still get her
to will it to me?

1668
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,000
And i had to adapt to the
situation and act like that.

1669
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:39,400
And the day that Cirie got
across that beam was an

1670
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,400
emotional day for everyone.

1671
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,320
The game didn't stop, though.
And guess what?

1672
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,360
Michaela's sitting on the
sit-out bench not getting to play.

1673
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:50,280
And at the bottom of her feet i
seeing in something.

1674
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,440
It says, "secret advantage" on it.

1675
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,560
Anyone that was there that day
had the opportunity to see that.

1676
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,680
It wasn't hidden.

1677
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:01,680
Paying attention to detail is
how my playing the game got me

1678
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,120
right here.

1679
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,160
Michaela, you were
involved in a twist when the

1680
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,360
advantage was at your feet that
you didn't even really know about.

1681
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,120
Yeah, like, it was a great move.

1682
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:16,200
And the thing that makes Sarah
so bad-ass, is that she got the

1683
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,760
advantage from the
sit-out bench that i was on.

1684
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,720
If you are working people so
well that you can be so bold as

1685
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,760
to say, "that was an advantage
that was meant for you, and i

1686
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,160
took it," that's
some bad-ass stuff.

1687
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,880
And then to top it off, you used
it against me and sent me home.

1688
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,280
That was brilliant!

1689
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,920
Cirie, it's very interesting
that we have so many

1690
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:40,000
different opinions.

1691
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:44,200
What does that say about all the
elements that come in to

1692
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,520
deciding who wins?

1693
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,560
It matters, Jeff, because we
have to look at every single

1694
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:53,840
aspect, and if you fell short
anywhere, we have to bring it up

1695
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,920
because we're going to award
somebody a million dollars

1696
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,240
that's not one of us.

1697
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,960
We want to make sure that we're
giving it to the right person.

1698
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:04,040
So, the game is
clearly still alive.

1699
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,800
Now we're at the outlast
portion of the game.

1700
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,160
Did you put the people on the
jury that respect your outwit,

1701
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,040
and your outplay more
than the other two?

1702
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,040
Culpepper, we'll start with you.

1703
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,800
This is your last chance
to move anybody

1704
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,840
that you think might not
be on your side.

1705
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:23,680
I don't think you have to
deceive and lie to every single

1706
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,200
person to win this game.

1707
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,320
I came into the game,
let people come to me.

1708
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:30,640
I built relationships that
changed the game at certain points.

1709
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,040
Got flipped upside down.

1710
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:35,880
So at that point, i had to rely
on my athleticism or brain

1711
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,360
And i did just that.

1712
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,920
So i was able to get to the end,
and i won the five immunitys.

1713
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,080
And then as far as the living
and the camp life, i don't know

1714
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,960
that i did all that
to get your votes.

1715
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,440
I did all that because
that's who i am.

1716
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,280
But anyway, it's been an honor
and a privilege to play with all you guys.

1717
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,160
Sarah, last chance to
sway the jury.

1718
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,000
Okay, here's the thing.

1719
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,560
You have to strike
first in this game.

1720
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,160
The reason you guys are there
and these two aren't is because

1721
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,000
i truly believe you guys could
have beat me.

1722
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:13,480
I just hope that you guys can
respect the game play and how

1723
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:19,000
hard it was to play with 20
people at such a high-caliber a

1724
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,800
player, and be one
step ahead every time.

1725
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:26,000
Because i was the one person
here that was in on every vote.

1726
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,960
I think the history shows that
the training and the ability to

1727
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:33,200
adapt to the situations that
you're placed in is what saves

1728
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,600
my life when i'm at work.

1729
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,680
And that same
training i applied out

1730
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,760
here to save my
life in this game.

1731
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,520
All right, Troyzan.

1732
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,200
I'm just going to keep it
light, you guys, and i have a

1733
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,920
pretty good idea where
you stand with me.

1734
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,560
So i might not have been
the best strategist.

1735
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,480
I might not have been
the best game player.

1736
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,920
But i want to tell you
how much i appreciate

1737
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,600
all of you for this adventure.

1738
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,960
You're a part of my dream.

1739
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,120
I've watched from season one,
you know, when Richard Hatch was

1740
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,960
running around naked
and people eat rats.

1741
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,480
And i'm like whatever that is.
I have to be a part of it.

1742
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,680
I appreciate it from the
bottom of my heart.

1743
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,800
Really, it means a lot, you
guys, and i'm out.

1744
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,800
Good job, everybdoy.

1745
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,440
All right, a great Final Tribal.

1746
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,240
Very healthy discussion.

1747
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,440
I'm going to give the jury a
moment to take in everything

1748
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,240
you've heard tonight,
and then you will make

1749
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,240
a million-dollar decision.

1750
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:43,200
All right, jury,
tonight, you are voting for a winner.

1751
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,440
The person you think most
deserving of the title of Sole

1752
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:49,440
Survivor and the million
dollars that goes along with it.

1753
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,960
For the last time,
it is time to vote.

1754
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,960
Sierra, you're up.

1755
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,720
You played a flawless game, girl.

1756
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:11,720
Anybody who doesn't
vote for you is a bitter betty.

1757
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:29,840
I hope that you can do what
i've tried to do four times.

1758
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,960
I think you deserve it.

1759
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:43,160
I am so honored to be voting
for you, one of the great

1760
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,480
masters and great
players of this game.

1761
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,120
Congratulations, officer Sarah.

1762
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:00,480
Because in this jaded, crazy
world, good guys finish first.

1763
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,120
I'll go get the votes.

1764
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,680
Culpepper, Sarah,
Troyzan, jury, thank you for a

1765
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,440
great Final Tribal.

1766
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,280
I will see everybody back in the
states for the reading of the votes.

1767
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,440
Cochran!

1768
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,400
All right.
Thank you.

1769
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,440
Awesome, have a seat!

1770
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,760
Let's not waste any time.

1771
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,080
Thank you for that nice welcome.
So here's its deal.

1772
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:38,600
When we had this idea to do
Game Changers we talked about,

1773
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,600
we thought about who
we wanted to come back.

1774
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,680
We said we have,
truly, one hope.

1775
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,320
Please let there
be some big moves.

1776
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,800
That was a genuine hope.

1777
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:53,120
You guys delivered so many big
moves, you made history.

1778
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,920
Thank you for another amazing
season of Survivor.

1779
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:04,520
But now, it comes down to this.

1780
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:09,520
After 39 days of decisions,
Brad, Troyzan, Sarah,

1781
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,400
did you make the right one?

1782
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,880
The jury, did you put people on
the jury who think you deserve

1783
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,320
it more than the other two?

1784
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,160
I'm going to read the votes.

1785
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:24,160
Here we go.

1786
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,160
First vote...

1787
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:28,600
Sarah.

1788
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,720
Culpepper.

1789
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,320
One vote Sarah, one vote Culpepper.

1790
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:45,800
Sarah.
Two votes Sarah, one vote Culpepper.

1791
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,040
Culpepper.
We're tied.

1792
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:54,720
Two votes Sarah, two votes Culpepper.

1793
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,160
Culpepper.

1794
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:03,400
Three votes Culpepper,
two votes Sarah.

1795
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,600
Sarah.

1796
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,480
We're tied again.
Three votes Culpepper, three votes Sarah.

1797
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,320
Sarah.

1798
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,840
That's four votes Sarah,
three votes Culpepper.

1799
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,560
Sarah.

1800
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:32,880
Five votes Sarah, four--three votes Culpepper.

1801
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,440
The winner of Survivor: Game
Changers: Sarah.

1802
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,920
It was an epic win.
You could hear the energy here.

1803
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,440
Sarah, here's your check.

1804
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,360
She's celebrating.

1805
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,280
You'll take it.
All right.

1806
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,760
We called them Game Changers
and they lived up to it.

1807
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:18,000
Historic game play, plus a
moment that had the entire world

1808
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,040
talking when zeke was
outed as transgender.

1809
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,320
We have a Zeke, Varner
and everybody else.

1810
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:25,760
Live reunion show coming up next.
