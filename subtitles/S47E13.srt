00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,735
Welcome to a special
two-hour penultimate episode

2
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:14,148
of <i>survivor</i> 47.

3
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:16,804
Like any season of <i>survivor,</i>
this one's been unique,

4
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:19,528
and it's really centered
around two big themes.

5
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:23,045
A constant shift of power.

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,769
Every player in the game has
been on the bottom and the top.

7
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:29,080
The other theme is some
very savvy social game play,

8
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:31,355
which has made it very hard to know

9
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:33,355
who's telling the truth and who's lying.

10
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:34,779
And it's led to some big moments,

11
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:37,183
like last week's operation Italy,

12
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:39,873
a beautifully-executed charade

13
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,804
that took Caroline out of the game

14
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:43,804
and left us with six players.

15
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:46,907
A final six that nobody would
have predicted on day one,

16
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,424
starting with Andy.

17
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:50,045
Got off to one of the worst starts

18
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:51,873
in the history of <i>survivor.</i>

19
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:54,459
But instead of giving in, he dug in

20
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:57,011
and he found his
footing, and he's still here.

21
00:00:57,114 --> 00:00:59,631
He had power early in the game,

22
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,528
but since the merge,
he's been on the bottom

23
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:05,459
and has had to play scrappy
every day just to alive.

24
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:09,286
She is social, she's strategic,

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,804
she is cutthroat, and everybody knows it.

26
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:15,114
And that's why she has a
very big target on her back.

27
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:17,976
She's got an idol. Nobody knows about it.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,217
But her real strength in the
game has come from loyalty.

29
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:24,493
And with the Caroline
vote-out, she lost her last ally.

30
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:26,183
And for the first time this season,

31
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,976
sue is alone in the game.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,252
She's been very open.

33
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:31,873
She's an emotional player.

34
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:34,080
It's worked for her,
it's worked against her.

35
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:37,045
But what has kept her in
the game are her social skills.

36
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,804
Finally, Rachel.

37
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:41,700
She's already won two
individual immunity challenges.

38
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:44,907
She has a block a vote and
an idol that nobody knows about.

39
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:48,390
That is a lot of power with
only six players left in the game

40
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:50,286
and she's gonna need
it because right now,

41
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,597
Rachel is the biggest threat in the game.

42
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,676
All right, tonight we're
gonna have two challenges,

43
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,045
two tribal councils.

44
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:58,286
We'll go from six to five to four,

45
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,493
and if you can get to
four, then at the very least,

46
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:03,804
you are guaranteed a shot to make fire

47
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,217
and you got a shot to win this game.

48
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:09,976
But all it takes is just one mistake

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,597
and your game is done.

50
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,321
That's why <i>survivor</i> is so difficult to win

51
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:16,390
and so fun to watch.

52
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:18,942
All right, here we go.

53
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,459
<i>Previously on</i> survivor...

54
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,114
This is the defining night

55
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,942
for the rest of this game.

56
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:35,631
<i>The goal is build suspicion</i>

57
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:37,080
<i>that one of you has an idol.</i>

58
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:38,666
<i>If we do that,</i>

59
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,804
<i>they will be compelled to split the vote.</i>

60
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,424
I'm most afraid of the idol.

61
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,700
So then, we would need

62
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:45,459
- to then split the vote.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:48,148
Thank you, Andy.

64
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,262
This is the biggest heist <i>of</i> survivor.

65
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:52,286
Yeah.

66
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,735
<i>And we're calling it</i> operation Italy.

67
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:02,424
If anybody has an advantage

68
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,918
or an idol and you want to play it,

69
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,355
now would be the time to do so.

70
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,147
All right, I'll read the votes.

71
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,390
Twelfth person voted out of <i>survivor</i> 47

72
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:18,252
and the fifth member of our jury:

73
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:20,252
- Caroline.
- Okay.

74
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,424
The tribe has spoken.

75
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:47,148
<i>Tribal really sucked tonight.</i>

76
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:50,148
<i>Caroline was blindsided, so,</i>

77
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:53,942
I lost my only tuku member left.

78
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,493
I'm just so bummed.

79
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:57,562
<i>Thank god that I have an idol,</i>

80
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,666
<i>because I'm in trouble.</i>

81
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,321
<i>Andy was supposed to be
working with myself, Rachel,</i>

82
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:06,217
<i>Caroline and teeny,
but</i> Andy freakin' flipped.

83
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:09,942
<i>So right now, I want to rip
Andy's head off his shoulders.</i>

84
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:15,045
So frustrated. So frustrated.

85
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:19,321
My god.

86
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,942
<i>Tribal was incredible.</i>

87
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,942
Operation Italy.

88
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:27,355
It went off to perfection.

89
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,976
<i>And to sit here</i>

90
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,849
<i>having pulled off the
biggest move of the season,</i>

91
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:33,666
<i>this is the feeling you want
when you come out here.</i>

92
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,424
<i>Like, I'm playing</i> survivor <i>for real.</i>

93
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:38,493
I'm actually doing it, and.

94
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,769
I love... it's-it's...

95
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:46,252
Okay, can I say, I'm
so happy to hear that?

96
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,011
I-I feel the love tonight.

97
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:51,907
- No.
- No.

98
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,631
<i>Tonight, Sam and I were both</i>

99
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:55,735
<i>on the chopping block, so,</i>

100
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:59,286
by all accounts, I should
not be sitting here today

101
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,907
to speak about the
success of operation Italy.

102
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:07,286
<i>It was such a long shot, but</i> it worked.

103
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,907
Andy... he is...

104
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,838
Better at this game than we all thought

105
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:15,666
or... we're all worse than we thought.

106
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:17,780
I've never seen someone
flip-flop so much in my life.

107
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:19,228
Just... I have no respect for people

108
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,838
that just flip-flop, but whatever.

109
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:24,459
I'm so pissed at him.

110
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:27,907
It is safe to say that not
one single thing went the way

111
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,528
I thought it was going
to go at tribal council.

112
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:34,459
<i>Me, Rachel and sue all look like idiots</i>

113
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,459
because we had a plan.

114
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:40,424
<i>And Andy flipped on us. And
so, we need to talk right now.</i>

115
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:41,838
Because what the hell, Andy?

116
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,976
That was insane to do.

117
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,148
Why don't we run this
back first and let's explain

118
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:48,573
- what just happened.
- Well, I-I thought of this

119
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,114
on the way to tribal council.

120
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,424
I was like, "this is better
in pretty much every way."

121
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:55,424
<i>So, we spilt up
Caroline, sue and Rachel.</i>

122
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:57,562
<i>It seemed like</i> Genevieve and Sam knew

123
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,183
you were going to do this all along.

124
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:01,011
No.

125
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:03,321
<i>I know I need to do damage control.</i>

126
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:05,942
<i>Teeny is feeling like I have</i>

127
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:08,148
joined Genevieve and Sam

128
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:10,700
in a grand conspiracy
to take over the game.

129
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,286
That is true.

130
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,011
<i>But no, no, no, we
can't let her believe that.</i>

131
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:16,562
Those are, like...

132
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,642
Yeah.

133
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,907
<i>Right now, there's six
of us left in the game.</i>

134
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:25,252
<i>That makes it extra important for us</i>

135
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:28,114
<i>to recruit teeny as a majority vote.</i>

136
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,804
<i>Fortunately, teeny's kind of, like,</i>

137
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,424
<i>confused about what happened.</i>

138
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:35,493
<i>And so,</i> we play it off like

139
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:38,114
it was this happy accident.

140
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:41,942
The fact is, you lied to me,
thinking I was going home.

141
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:43,942
- Yes.
- Andy wanted to vote me home,

142
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:45,700
but then changed his mind to save me.

143
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:47,538
So I told Genevieve to
play the idol, which was best

144
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:49,562
for her, but she didn't
trust me on my gut,

145
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,321
so then she didn't play it.

146
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,090
And then somehow,
we came out with the idol

147
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:55,804
and Caroline went home.

148
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:58,321
<i>I think teeny, right now, is in panic mode,</i>

149
00:06:58,424 --> 00:07:01,666
<i>and she's very vulnerable, and so,</i>

150
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:05,183
teeny bought it every
single step of the way.

151
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:09,183
So, it was... Chef's kiss.

152
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:11,045
I walked out of that tribal council

153
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:12,780
just, like, smiling, looking at the stars.

154
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:14,504
- I smiled and shook my head.
- And I... I was just like,

155
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:15,873
"how the... did that happen?"

156
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:18,286
<i>At this point, I have no idea</i>

157
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,011
what my way to the end is anymore.

158
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:24,528
<i>I don't trust anybody anymore.</i>

159
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:27,321
And with six people left,
there's really nowhere to hide.

160
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:28,907
At this point, this is...

161
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:31,459
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

162
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:33,159
- This is who it's gonna be.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

163
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:35,459
If we get Rachel out,
this is who it's gonna be.

164
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:38,252
<i>Even though me and
Rachel were working together,</i>

165
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:40,907
<i>she is the biggest
challenge threat at this point,</i>

166
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,321
<i>and she's the biggest
fire threat at the final four.</i>

167
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:44,804
<i>So,</i>

168
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:47,562
my brain does make a
switch. I do want to work

169
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,769
<i>with Sam and Genevieve and
Andy to get Rachel out of this game.</i>

170
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:52,252
This is really a moment

171
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:55,183
of having to jump ship
and adapt in <i>survivor.</i>

172
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:57,080
Did teeny go down with them?

173
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:01,976
<i>So, when we got back from tribal,</i>

174
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,700
Andy, teeny, Sam
and Genevieve take off.

175
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:10,114
<i>And I just felt like, in that moment,</i>

176
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,148
<i>I needed to know what was going on,</i>

177
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:14,114
and I followed them.

178
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:21,148
<i>I think one of the things
that you can't grasp at home,</i>

179
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,321
because you always see
the, like, infrared camera,

180
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:24,769
and, you know, it feels like

181
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:26,469
there's got to be a flashlight somewhere,

182
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:28,976
<i>but you can't see anything.</i>

183
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,838
<i>It's dark. It's pitch black.</i>

184
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:34,666
I don't appreciate it

185
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,366
<i>- I mean, I couldn't see them.
- I could only hear them.</i>

186
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,907
<i>So I'm following their voices.</i>

187
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,459
<i>And I basically crawl on my belly</i>

188
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,528
<i>underneath a bush right next to them,</i>

189
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,080
and I just listen to their
entire conversation.

190
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:53,493
Sol saved her, she took out Kyle

191
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,331
with beating him the necklace, she
became the challenge champ - yeah.

192
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:56,918
- After him.
- She's incredible at challenges.

193
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:58,780
And I think she has a
really close relationship

194
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,804
with Caroline.

195
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:05,504
- So... she cannot win.
- She can't win.

196
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:07,297
- She cannot win.
- I think everything is kind of

197
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:09,942
crystallized, and we just have to gun

198
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:12,390
for the immunity necklace.

199
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,390
So I find out so much.

200
00:09:14,493 --> 00:09:17,011
<i>I learn that they're all gunning for me.</i>

201
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:18,424
<i>I hear my name.</i>

202
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:20,942
I hear, "she cannot win tomorrow,"

203
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:22,424
"anybody but her."

204
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,090
- That's so bad.
- Genevieve, I told you

205
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:26,504
you do have nerves of steel.
When you didn't play that thing,

206
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:27,648
I was like, "wait a minute."

207
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,562
<i>I found out</i> Genevieve does have an idol,

208
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,355
and that she has balls of
steel to have not played it yet.

209
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,148
Do you know what she's
got? Does she have an idol?

210
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:39,286
She does not have an
idol. She has a block a vote.

211
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,700
She can block somebody's vote.

212
00:09:40,804 --> 00:09:42,769
<i>And finally,</i>

213
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,631
<i>when teeny told Sam and
Genevieve about my advantage,</i>

214
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,838
<i>that's when I knew
that I didn't have teeny.</i>

215
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:51,459
<i>But the good news is that
they don't know I have an idol,</i>

216
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:53,286
<i>which is brilliant in the sense</i>

217
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,080
that they will never see
an idol coming from me.

218
00:09:57,252 --> 00:09:59,011
I...

219
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:04,217
Okay.

220
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:09,666
<i>And so, with this information,</i>

221
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:11,528
<i>I have more legs in this game</i>

222
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:14,424
<i>than anybody at camp realizes, and I can</i>

223
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,735
hopefully turn this game around.

224
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:44,321
<i>In the early morning, I woke up, and</i>

225
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:47,666
<i>I'm feeling a little broken. I'm just like,</i>

226
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:50,528
<i>"my god. Like, put me out of my misery."</i>

227
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:53,355
My poor Caroline.

228
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,976
I lost my girl.

229
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,390
<i>It freakin' sucks to lose
my last number one.</i>

230
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:03,114
<i>I'm devastated, but in the same breath,</i>

231
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:04,857
<i>it's something else I just got to suck up</i>

232
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:08,252
<i>and just stand up and
start playing the game hard.</i>

233
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,252
<i>I have an idol, but I
want to find another idol.</i>

234
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:27,804
<i>I want to find an advantage.
I want to still keep searching.</i>

235
00:12:27,907 --> 00:12:29,080
I just have to believe

236
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,183
that there's one more thing out there.

237
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,228
<i>I'm looking for a miracle.
Yeah, on</i> survivor.

238
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,183
<i>Is that possible?</i>

239
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:38,769
Is it possible to find
a miracle on <i>survivor?</i>

240
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:44,183
Are you okay?

241
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:46,597
I want to dig around this. I want to dig

242
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,424
can we please dig around this?

243
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:48,748
Hey.

244
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,768
I don't care if that
something's happened here.

245
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:52,976
I have an idol.

246
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,400
I found it day after the auction,

247
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:55,976
and I haven't told a single person.

248
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,459
I'm sorry. You've been
digging up everything?

249
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:02,114
- You don't have to dig here, okay?
- Okay.

250
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:05,390
<i>Rachel shows up.
She says, "don't worry.</i>

251
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,183
I have the idol."

252
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,907
And I'm like, "my god."

253
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:11,528
So now I know her secret.

254
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:14,080
<i>She has a block a vote advantage</i>

255
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:16,217
<i>and she has an idol.</i>

256
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:20,148
<i>I feel I've-I've built</i>

257
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:22,321
<i>a good alliance with Rachel.</i>

258
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:24,873
I trust her. She's
shared so much with me.

259
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,390
You cannot tell anybody, okay?

260
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:28,286
I'm not. We cannot tell anybody, okay?

261
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,493
<i>But I'm not sharing
that I have an idol, too,</i>

262
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:34,631
<i>because everybody wants her out, so,</i>

263
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:37,838
I might be able to hold it one more day.

264
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,942
If I don't win today,
I'm getting all the votes

265
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:43,045
because now that I've
won two immunities,

266
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:44,528
I'm this huge threat.

267
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,735
- So I think that we can trick them.
- Okay. Okay.

268
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:49,158
- I think we can do this.
- Yeah.

269
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:52,011
I think we have... we
have... We're not dead.

270
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,735
- Okay.
- Okay?

271
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:56,459
<i>It was scary to tell sue about the idol, but</i>

272
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:58,769
at this point, I need sue.

273
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,804
I have nobody else in this game,

274
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,562
and if I'm gonna pull off
anything, I need her trust.

275
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:09,666
We have to pretend because
Genevieve has an idol.

276
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,355
<i>And so, I tell her my plan.</i>

277
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,907
We have to pretend
like teeny is still with us.

278
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:17,424
We have to act like we have
no idea that she has flipped.

279
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:20,631
<i>I just want to make
them feel comfortable</i>

280
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,942
<i>so they don't know I have an idol,</i>

281
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,165
and I would kind of just
be able to, like, smoke 'em.

282
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,700
Tree mail!

283
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:31,976
All right. Day 23, immunity
challenge. Let's hear it.

284
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,390
<i>I need immunity</i> today so badly.

285
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:41,493
God.

286
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,976
No.

287
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,493
<i>If I win today,</i>

288
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,321
I think I can get to the end of this game

289
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,493
<i>because then I can use
my idol at the final five.</i>

290
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:57,976
<i>People, like, assume that
I would be down and upset</i>

291
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,735
<i>about my place in this game,
and yet, I am sitting here</i>

292
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:04,355
with a grin on my face, so excited

293
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,355
to just see if I am able to, like,

294
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,459
just shift these pieces into place

295
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:11,528
to get the result I want.

296
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:13,459
<i>And so, I'm either gonna</i>

297
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,355
<i>smash this out of the water</i>

298
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,700
or I'm gonna, like, flail in the water

299
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:19,528
and drown trying.

300
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:21,666
Bob and weave.

301
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,780
Hey, you want to spend
part of your summer living

302
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:27,080
in the jungles of Fiji,

303
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:28,711
experiencing the adventure of a lifetime?

304
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:30,080
Apply to be on <i>survivor.</i>

305
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:48,838
Bring in the boat!

306
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:01,735
- Boy.
- I know.

307
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,217
Best kind of <i>survivor</i>
entrance right there.

308
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:17,631
So, day 23, the final
six. Let's get to today's

309
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:19,873
immunity challenge. First things first.

310
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:21,493
Got to take it back, Rachel.

311
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:23,080
Second time.

312
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,148
Thank you.

313
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,838
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

314
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:34,011
<i>For today's challenge, you're
gonna leap into the ocean</i>

315
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:36,562
<i>and then swim to a platform</i>

316
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,114
<i>where you will find a
buoy attached to a rope.</i>

317
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:41,217
<i>You're gonna maneuver
that buoy through a series</i>

318
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:43,011
<i>of obstacles until you reach the finish,</i>

319
00:16:43,114 --> 00:16:46,873
<i>where you will race to
solve a</i> survivor <i>logo puzzle.</i>

320
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:53,493
I know you do, Rachel.

321
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,804
First person to finish

322
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:59,804
wins immunity, guaranteed
a spot in the final five.

323
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:03,355
In addition, you're playing for reward.

324
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,883
Want to know what you're playing for?

325
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,390
- Yeah. - Yes, badly.
- You'll be taken to

326
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,735
the sanctuary.

327
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,355
Where good things happen.

328
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,321
- Steak.
- Okay.

329
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:17,011
Baked potato, wine, juice

330
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:19,873
and cheesecake for dessert.

331
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:22,700
You talk about fuel to get you to the end?

332
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:25,114
This will do it. Losers,

333
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:26,737
tribal council, where somebody will be

334
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,666
the 13th person voted out,

335
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:31,011
become the sixth member of our jury.

336
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,838
Big enough "steaks"?

337
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:37,804
Yeah.

338
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:41,321
We'll draw for spots, and
we'll get it on. Here we go.

339
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,321
All right, here we go.

340
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:52,424
For immunity and reward,

341
00:17:52,528 --> 00:17:55,424
guaranteed spot in the final five.

342
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:57,080
Survivors ready?

343
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:01,424
Go! First you got to leap.

344
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,148
That's how you do it.

345
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,459
Now it's a swim to that platform,

346
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:11,528
and immediately start
working with that buoy.

347
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:14,769
You're maneuvering it
through a series of obstacles

348
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:16,148
as fast as you can.

349
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,562
Sam is ripping through it.

350
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,493
Sam is over quickly, out to an early lead.

351
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:27,631
Here comes Genevieve right on his tail.

352
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:32,045
Here comes Rachel.

353
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:35,838
Teeny with a sloppy fall, but it's okay.

354
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:38,493
Sue's in the water.

355
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:42,493
It is Sam in the lead.

356
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:45,148
Now you're gonna be putting
that buoy over and under.

357
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:51,321
If this puzzle is close,
every second's gonna count.

358
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,493
Now it's Genevieve in the lead.

359
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,631
Genevieve moved quickly
through that second stage

360
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:05,528
with the buoy and she's in the lead.

361
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:09,080
Sam right on her tail.

362
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,493
Here comes Rachel and Andy.

363
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:12,838
Genevieve's out of the water.

364
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,528
You're good. Get up, Genevieve.

365
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,769
Start working on the puzzle.

366
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:23,252
Here comes Rachel
gaining on Sam now.

367
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:26,838
Andy gaining on Rachel.
Teeny gaining on Andy.

368
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:28,700
And here comes sue.

369
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:30,424
Everybody's gonna be in this.

370
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:34,080
You got to get up on the
platform and start working.

371
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:37,735
There are all kinds
of puzzles on <i>survivor.</i>

372
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:40,493
Some puzzles come easier to others.

373
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,355
Sometimes you walk up, and you go,

374
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,011
"this puzzle's all mine."

375
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:50,459
Everybody now working
on this logo puzzle.

376
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:53,700
You've been wearing it
on your buff all season long.

377
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:57,321
You'll never forget this
logo, you win this puzzle.

378
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:59,735
It is Rachel out to a very fast start.

379
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:02,217
Genevieve on her tail.

380
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,976
Genevieve with another piece.

381
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,459
Rachel with another piece.

382
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:12,321
Andy just gonna look next door.

383
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:14,080
"I'm gonna let Rachel do the work.

384
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:16,056
I'll just see what she's doing."
Teeny gonna get in on that.

385
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,114
All that means is you're behind.

386
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:22,355
This is turning out to be a showdown

387
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:24,459
quickly between Rachel and Genevieve.

388
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:28,390
Genevieve with another piece.

389
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,493
Rachel with another piece.

390
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:36,976
Right now, if you were Genevieve
or Rachel, you got to keep

391
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,735
busting it, 'cause you got
somebody right on your tail.

392
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:42,804
Genevieve and Rachel

393
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:45,390
are ripping through this puzzle.

394
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:47,631
And another piece from Rachel.

395
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:49,080
Dude.

396
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,562
Genevieve with another piece.

397
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,390
Now it's Rachel who feels the pressure.

398
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:00,804
It is Genevieve clearly in the lead now.

399
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,321
Genevieve can feel that momentum.

400
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:07,045
Rachel trying to catch up.

401
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:10,252
Nobody else even close.

402
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:13,873
You might have more fun
just watching like I'm doing.

403
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,735
Genevieve down to six pieces.

404
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:24,217
Rachel about double that.

405
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:26,114
Rachel with another piece.

406
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:27,873
My god, come on...

407
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:31,528
Guaranteed spot in
the final five on the line.

408
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:36,148
Genevieve down to two pieces now.

409
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:39,838
Rachel with another piece.

410
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:41,262
Genevieve down to one piece left.

411
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:48,976
And it's over. Genevieve
wins individual immunity,

412
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,183
guaranteed a spot in the final five

413
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:54,804
of <i>survivor</i> 47.

414
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:57,011
Wow. That was the fastest I've ever seen

415
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:59,114
a logo puzzle put together.

416
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,321
Genevieve, come on over.

417
00:22:09,217 --> 00:22:11,390
First individual immunity win

418
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:14,666
guarantees you a spot in the final five.

419
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:16,390
- Yeah.
- In addition,

420
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:20,183
you've won an afternoon at the
sanctuary, where you are going

421
00:22:20,286 --> 00:22:23,252
to fuel your body for
that final push to the end.

422
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:25,942
Choose one person to join you.

423
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:29,769
Already Sam is shaking his head

424
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:31,597
- saying, "don't choose me"?
- Yeah.

425
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
My stomach is in absolute shambles,

426
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:37,769
so, do not waste a spot
on me on the reward.

427
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,493
Let somebody who hasn't eaten eat.

428
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:42,942
So in that case, I... I'm gonna take sue.

429
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:46,045
Come on over, sue.

430
00:22:47,562 --> 00:22:50,011
All right, Genevieve,
you have one more spot.

431
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:58,907
- Teeny.
- Teeny, come on over. - Yeah.

432
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:02,286
- Yeah, come on.
- My god.

433
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:04,493
Here's what's gonna happen.

434
00:23:04,597 --> 00:23:05,780
Three of you are going to the sanctuary,

435
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:07,666
three of you going back to camp.

436
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,080
Tonight, tribal council.

437
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:11,183
Somebody will be the
13th person voted out,

438
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:13,011
become the sixth member of our jury.

439
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:14,562
It won't be you. Bring in the boat.

440
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:19,700
Limo service.

441
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:21,080
- Fiji limo service.
- Yeah!

442
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:26,666
All right, head over,
board your <i>survivor</i> limo.

443
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:28,804
- Yeah.
- Enjoy your afternoon at the sanctuary.

444
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,424
- Thank you.
- Have fun.

445
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:33,148
Desserts!

446
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:37,011
Enjoy.

447
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:38,366
Andy, Rachel, Sam, got nothing for you.

448
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,056
Swim out. See you
tonight at tribal council.

449
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,873
<i>Genevieve beat me.</i>

450
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:44,838
<i>So, the majority of the votes
are going to fall on me tonight.</i>

451
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:46,907
<i>But I have a block a vote, and</i>

452
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,907
if I play my idol, sue and I

453
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,114
get to decide who goes home.

454
00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:53,321
<i>There is, like, a pleasure in the fact</i>

455
00:23:53,424 --> 00:23:55,286
<i>that sue and I</i>

456
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,390
have this power over
this larger group today.

457
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:10,838
- My goodness.
- My god.

458
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:12,769
My gosh. Wine. My.

459
00:24:12,873 --> 00:24:15,148
- Run, Genevieve.
- Go, Genevieve!

460
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,355
My god.

461
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:19,286
Wow.

462
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,597
I'm going to inhale every last bite of this.

463
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,528
- My god!
- Genevieve, thank you.

464
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,814
<i>I win this immunity challenge,</i>

465
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:29,838
which I am thrilled about.

466
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:31,459
Never doubted myself.

467
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:33,597
Jk. Doubted myself the whole time,

468
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,045
but pulled it out, and I'm very proud.

469
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:38,321
- Wow. I'll start by pouring us.
- Okay.

470
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:39,883
- Thank you.
- Let's not waste a single second.

471
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:41,193
- Pass me the juice, please.
- Yes.

472
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:42,459
I'll pass on the juice for now.

473
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:44,114
I got.. I got my juice.

474
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:46,976
- Let me know when anybody wants a refill.
- Okay.

475
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,804
<i>My main objective is,</i>

476
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:52,597
<i>have a nice time with these
two women that I have had</i>

477
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,045
up-and-down relationships
with throughout the game.

478
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:57,183
<i>I need to convince them</i>

479
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:58,918
<i>that Rachel's the
biggest target to everyone,</i>

480
00:24:58,942 --> 00:25:01,597
<i>and I don't want to push too aggressively</i>

481
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,942
at this point.

482
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,493
I'm voting for Rachel.

483
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,217
I see her as the-the
biggest sort of obstacle

484
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:11,838
for me getting to the end.

485
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:13,873
What are you thinking, teeny?

486
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:16,114
I will never beat her in a puzzle.

487
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:18,700
I will never beat her in fire,

488
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:21,080
and I kind of want to
eliminate that option.

489
00:25:21,183 --> 00:25:24,493
<i>Genevieve and teeny
are going for Rachel,</i>

490
00:25:24,597 --> 00:25:27,424
but I know she has an
idol. She's playing her idol.

491
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:30,804
<i>So whoever Rachel
and I decide to vote for</i>

492
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:32,700
will go home tonight.

493
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:35,597
- I'm gonna die.
- Let teeny fill up.

494
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,114
I'm not filling up anymore.

495
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:39,057
- Did you put more wine in our glasses?
- Yes.

496
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:42,631
Yeah.

497
00:25:42,735 --> 00:25:44,642
Okay, so when we get back
to camp, what do I tell Rachel?

498
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:47,183
- Yeah.
- I think she knows.

499
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:49,435
That's something I also
wanted to say to you is that, like,

500
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:51,735
when you didn't play that idol, I was.

501
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:55,666
I have a secret idol that no one...

502
00:25:58,045 --> 00:26:00,666
The hypothetical idol
that I don't know exists.

503
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:03,493
<i>Because I had a little
red wine in my system,</i>

504
00:26:03,597 --> 00:26:08,148
<i>I told sue that Genevieve has an idol.</i>

505
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:12,011
And instantly, I'm just
face-palming myself.

506
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:14,666
<i>And I just started to be</i>

507
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:16,528
<i>in good with Genevieve again. So,</i>

508
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:19,114
I know I made a mistake.

509
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:21,321
The red wine's talking now.

510
00:26:21,424 --> 00:26:24,183
<i>I've revealed myself
as the 23-year-old I am</i>

511
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:26,252
in that I can't get a few drinks in me

512
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:28,424
without spilling the secrets

513
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:30,700
that are really, really important

514
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:32,114
to people in this game.

515
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,321
You did good, girl.

516
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,080
- Good job.
- Thank you.

517
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:40,011
<i>Teeny has now let my
idol secret spill to sue.</i>

518
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:41,528
I don't care.

519
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:43,666
It's not an idol.

520
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,252
But the more people
<i>that think it is, the better</i>

521
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,631
<i>for my game. I mean,</i>

522
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:50,297
I should be thanking
you. This is amazing

523
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:51,735
for my game. Great job.

524
00:26:51,838 --> 00:26:54,080
<i>Keep it up. I'll give you a refill here.</i>

525
00:26:54,183 --> 00:26:56,597
Tell her more about how
real this fake idol is. Go for it.

526
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,424
- Sorry.
- My... <i>There's an undeniable amount</i>

527
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:05,217
of good fortune hitting me on day 23.

528
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:14,424
Think you can beat Genevieve, Sam?

529
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:16,217
No.

530
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:18,355
Why'd you guys all
hand her the... game?

531
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:19,952
'Cause I think you
both could have beat me

532
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:22,056
more... better than you
could have beaten Genevieve.

533
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,321
And I don't understand.

534
00:27:24,424 --> 00:27:27,286
How do you feel about
your big move, Andy?

535
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,804
<i>It's three gata members...
me, Andy and Rachel</i>

536
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:32,769
<i>sitting on a beach, day 23.</i>

537
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:36,011
We've all kind of been on
this roller coaster of a game,

538
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,942
weaving in and out of one another,

539
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:40,355
coming after one another,
trying to work in Harmony.

540
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:44,045
<i>And so, this is an
opportunity with Rachel</i>

541
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:47,286
<i>to clear the air, to lay out all my cards.</i>

542
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,666
Like, I feel like I laid a
lot of my cards out for you

543
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,666
because I was looking for,

544
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:54,252
like, who wanted to
play the game with me.

545
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:56,666
I feel like you heard me,

546
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:59,735
but wanted to play with sue and Caroline

547
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:01,493
and teeny and Andy,

548
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,562
and I wasn't really part of your plans.

549
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,873
So, I had to find another way

550
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:10,528
to move forward in the game, so

551
00:28:10,631 --> 00:28:12,976
I do think you would win
the game if you got there.

552
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,804
It might be difficult for
you to see, being you, but...

553
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:17,838
It is difficult for me to see.

554
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:19,942
<i>Today was the first time in the game</i>

555
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:22,114
<i>that I've been very direct with somebody</i>

556
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:23,537
<i>about where my vote was gonna go.</i>

557
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:26,321
And you're always hesitant in <i>survivor</i>

558
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:29,355
to, like, let your target
know that they're your target.

559
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,769
That could backfire on you.

560
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:34,355
But in the moment, it
just kind of felt right to me.

561
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:38,631
It felt like the closing of the book of gata.

562
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:40,804
It's hard decisions, man.

563
00:28:40,907 --> 00:28:43,355
I know. I don't... None of it's personal.

564
00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:44,873
Like, just know that, like,

565
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:47,080
I'm pissed, but I'm pissed
because I'm just like,

566
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,838
"god, this is close." You know?

567
00:28:48,942 --> 00:28:50,355
- Yeah.
- Sucks to get this close.

568
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:52,907
It sucks to... Yeah, you're right.

569
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:55,252
<i>Just sitting there</i> with these two guys

570
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:56,538
who I've been with since day one

571
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:58,597
<i>it's a little bittersweet.</i>

572
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,631
Genuinely, this is a game to me,

573
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:02,114
and it always has been.

574
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:04,769
So... like, I love you guys.

575
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:07,907
We will hang out after this.

576
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,424
Yeah.

577
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:12,355
And I'm not mad at
you. I'm mad at myself.

578
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,907
Today was my... challenge
to lose, and I'm so mad.

579
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:17,942
I'm so mad that I lost it.

580
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:20,597
I knew everything was riding on it.

581
00:29:24,286 --> 00:29:26,942
<i>There's, like, a brotherly
sense to them, right?</i>

582
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:29,080
<i>We've been here for
23 days, but it genuinely</i>

583
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:30,676
feels like I've known these guys for, like,

584
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,459
at least a year or two at this point.

585
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,080
<i>And so, I think today, it just kind of all hit.</i>

586
00:29:36,183 --> 00:29:39,942
These challenges are
wildly unpredictable.

587
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,907
I know, but it's a puzzle, man.

588
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:45,252
<i>But at the same time,
it's just kind of this really</i>

589
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:47,769
funny dynamic where I'm kind of,

590
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:52,597
like, playing into my, you
know, "imminent death."

591
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,562
<i>And yet, I know I'm not dying tonight.</i>

592
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,045
I'm gonna be waking up here tomorrow

593
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:01,528
and one of them won't be.

594
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,424
<i>But if I do not have
to play this idol tonight,</i>

595
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:11,666
I get to play it tomorrow
and guarantee myself fire,

596
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:14,080
<i>which is even better for me.</i>

597
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:16,183
<i>And so, I want to connect with Andy.</i>

598
00:30:16,286 --> 00:30:18,355
I want to be real with Andy, and

599
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:21,873
I want him to kind of try and
see my perspective and see why.

600
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:25,321
<i>Sam is a better vote than me tonight.</i>

601
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,700
From what I've heard when
people chatter about Andy

602
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:31,400
it's never been in the
sense of, like, you're a threat.

603
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,769
And so, I think you do
have an uphill battle.

604
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,321
- Yeah.
- And I think

605
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:37,873
if you and Sam sat there tonight,

606
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:38,282
yeah.

607
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:40,424
As the final two, he
would win, hands down.

608
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:41,735
Yeah.

609
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:43,459
I just think right now,

610
00:30:43,562 --> 00:30:45,907
the perception of you with
the jury is relatively low.

611
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:49,780
- It's not, like, bad.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

612
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,666
But it's also not good.

613
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:52,873
And I think Sam has

614
00:30:53,907 --> 00:30:55,424
<i>better relationships,</i>

615
00:30:55,528 --> 00:30:57,493
<i>and I think that I would lose votes to him,</i>

616
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:59,735
- even if I sat next to him.
- Yeah.

617
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:01,321
<i>It's very clear</i>

618
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,562
<i>that the conventional
long-running narrative is</i>

619
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:06,193
<i>that I am not a threat, and Sam
is a threat, and Sam is a threat</i>

620
00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:09,011
because he is someone
who can definitely garner

621
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:10,976
a lot of jury votes in the end of the game.

622
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,735
Your superpower is that the way

623
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,769
you move around the world is, like,

624
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:19,011
a little careless, genuinely.

625
00:31:19,114 --> 00:31:23,562
And... because of that,
people underestimate you.

626
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:24,907
<i>I'm sick of it.</i>

627
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:26,907
I'm sick of being
underestimated in this game,

628
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,493
because you just want to be out here,

629
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,397
and you want to be
known as a capable player.

630
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:31,745
I think you do have a better story

631
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:33,424
against me than you do against Sam.

632
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:35,493
You've deceived me multiple times.

633
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:36,942
<i>I've gained a lot of confidence</i>

634
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:38,907
<i>in my decision-making, but I can</i>

635
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:41,493
<i>kind of maybe feel the pressure of</i>

636
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:44,183
how important this vote is for my game.

637
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:47,804
I'm-I'm pretty sick of lying
to you, though. I don't like it.

638
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,838
So, I don't have an answer right now.

639
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,286
Yeah, no rush.

640
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,562
<i>At this point, I need my
perception to turn. So,</i>

641
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,838
I'm closing zero doors right now.

642
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:00,262
Absolutely zero doors, and I
don't know what I'm gonna do.

643
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,597
Hi.

644
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,080
- How was it?
- Good.

645
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:22,907
- Hello, beka.
- Hello.

646
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,148
Full.

647
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:27,597
<i>Coming back to camp,</i>

648
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,321
I need to make sure that
the obvious, easy vote

649
00:32:31,424 --> 00:32:33,942
of Rachel stays the vote.

650
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:37,217
<i>And the thing that worries me is</i>

651
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:39,114
<i>when things feel obvious and easy,</i>

652
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,252
<i>that's when players</i>

653
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:43,459
<i>"think" maybe now is a good time</i>

654
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,907
<i>to do something," you know?</i>

655
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:47,435
And I want to make
sure everyone knows,

656
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:49,804
<i>"tonight, let's not do something crazy.</i>

657
00:32:49,907 --> 00:32:51,838
Let's just do Rachel."

658
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:58,286
- What do you mean?
- You mean she yelled at you?

659
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,493
She's like, "I hope you
enjoyed your move last night."

660
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,321
- I'm sorry, Andy.
- That's okay.

661
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:07,597
It was literally, like, we sat there

662
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,860
and acknowledged the fact
that we were voting her out.

663
00:33:09,942 --> 00:33:11,562
- Did you?
- Yeah.

664
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:15,459
<i>Right now, I feel very uneasy.</i>

665
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:17,873
I think I'm Rachel's target tonight.

666
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:19,804
I think Rachel's coming after me.

667
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:22,804
<i>She doesn't realize how big
of a threat Andy is right now,</i>

668
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:25,424
<i>and Genevieve is immune, so,</i>

669
00:33:25,528 --> 00:33:27,976
I think if there's a hiccup tonight,

670
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,390
I'm in a lot of trouble.

671
00:33:29,493 --> 00:33:31,252
Andy, what are you thinking?

672
00:33:31,355 --> 00:33:32,666
- Truth-truthfully?
- Yeah.

673
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,528
This is the endgame.
I'm weighing my options.

674
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,217
Would we be, like, a final
three if I were to vote with you?

675
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:45,942
- Yes.
- We'd be a final three?

676
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:48,056
I mean, we don't have loyalty
to any of those other people.

677
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,700
- Right.
- Yeah.

678
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:51,424
And no one else has given us a bone.

679
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:52,976
Yeah.

680
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,321
I would not vote you out

681
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:56,252
tomorrow if you saved me today.

682
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:57,631
I promise you that.

683
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,976
You promise?

684
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,435
I promise. Do you promise him that?

685
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:02,424
I promise that I will not
vote you out tomorrow.

686
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:07,148
<i>The logistics of Rachel's
pitch are pretty clear.</i>

687
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:09,873
<i>With her block a vote
advantage, you do the numbers,</i>

688
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:11,390
<i>it's not hard to see that</i>

689
00:34:11,493 --> 00:34:14,321
Rachel just needs
two people on her side,

690
00:34:14,424 --> 00:34:15,676
<i>and she believes she has sue already.</i>

691
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,080
<i>So if she could</i>

692
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:19,976
just swing just me, just
little old me, over to her,

693
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,631
<i>then we can become
the majority on a final five.</i>

694
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:26,286
Now... that's interesting.

695
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,321
- Yeah.
- I think that it was clear that

696
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:31,873
you're in dead last because
Genevieve would have taken Sam.

697
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:34,080
She didn't. She then took teeny and sue

698
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:35,735
- and not you.
- Yeah.

699
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,114
<i>If I look at this game so far,</i>

700
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:39,666
I've been on a real hot streak,

701
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:42,045
and I've been pulling
off really cool moves

702
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,493
that I could sell to a jury.

703
00:34:43,597 --> 00:34:46,493
<i>And so, what if I go
with Rachel and sue?</i>

704
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:47,976
<i>What if I knock someone out</i>

705
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,321
<i>that I've been working with very recently?</i>

706
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,045
I mean, that's a pretty bold move.

707
00:34:52,148 --> 00:34:54,602
Yeah, it's a big decision for me, for sure.

708
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,011
Yeah.

709
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:57,080
<i>This decision is, like, it's game-breaking</i>

710
00:34:57,183 --> 00:34:58,631
<i>if it's not correct.</i>

711
00:34:58,735 --> 00:35:00,631
<i>And if I make the right decision,</i>

712
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,321
<i>I think I'm ready to just</i>

713
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:06,011
keep hitting my stride, and...
And go on to win this game.

714
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:08,562
You have to.

715
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,148
You have to play your idol.

716
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:12,183
I was hoping...

717
00:35:12,286 --> 00:35:13,976
- You're not swaying them.
- Okay.

718
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,329
They're all against you.
Teeny's against you, too.

719
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:15,745
I believe you.

720
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,217
- I promise you.
- I know she is.

721
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:19,735
I was hoping... Andy's
a very rational player.

722
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:21,252
I was hoping by appealing...

723
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:22,735
No, he ratted you out.

724
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:24,942
He just told everybody
what you said to him.

725
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:26,321
Everything.

726
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,252
- Don't trust him.
- Okay.

727
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:30,459
<i>My loyalty to Rachel is real,</i>

728
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:34,045
<i>and so, I'm gonna go
with what she wants to do.</i>

729
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:38,424
<i>Every single person thinks that Rachel is</i>

730
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:41,666
absolutely going home.

731
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,700
Yes.

732
00:35:47,873 --> 00:35:49,711
- It'll be announced before the vote?
- No, it'll be when he goes

733
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:51,858
up to the booth, it will
just say he can't vote.

734
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:52,882
Okay.

735
00:35:54,459 --> 00:35:55,735
Yeah. Yeah.

736
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:56,907
Okay.

737
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:59,942
<i>Meanwhile,</i> I know she has an idol,

738
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:02,011
and I know she's gonna freakin'

739
00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:04,597
burn them so bad.

740
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:11,252
My brain's been going nuts all day,

741
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:14,217
'cause I'm thinking, weighing my options.

742
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:20,424
But... It's best for me
to vote you out tonight.

743
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:21,804
Okay.

744
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:24,493
And I want to say a
couple things about that.

745
00:36:24,597 --> 00:36:28,700
In terms of my move last night,

746
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:33,045
I do feel like I have maybe
some more information

747
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:34,769
that is influencing these decisions

748
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,183
- okay.
- Than it appears now.

749
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:41,114
And so, I would ask you, as a friend,

750
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:43,804
to keep a little bit of an open mind

751
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:46,528
to some of the decisions
I'm making, and...

752
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:51,183
Yeah, you'll be on the jury, but I want

753
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:53,528
I actually care more
about you respecting me

754
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:56,323
because I... because of
how much I respect you.

755
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:56,735
Okay.

756
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:58,424
<i>I know I'm not going home tonight, but</i>

757
00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:01,942
clearly, everyone thinks I
don't have anything, and so,

758
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:06,631
I allow Andy <i>to tell me all about his game</i>

759
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:08,735
<i>and how he's been playing.</i>

760
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:12,297
I think that there's a lot that I've done

761
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:13,976
on purpose in this game

762
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,528
in which a final tribal council
would be a really good venue

763
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:18,183
to talk about.

764
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:21,114
<i>I would guess that this
approach from Andy is coming</i>

765
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:22,804
from a place of jury management.

766
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,804
He thinks that I'm
heading to the jury next.

767
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:29,562
<i>And hearing Andy
kind of talk about himself</i>

768
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,148
<i>it does give me pause.</i>

769
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:32,666
<i>I started seeing him</i>

770
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,889
as more of a threat than I
was giving him credit for.

771
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:44,735
And I wanted to just say goodbye to you.

772
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:47,942
<i>Andy is trying to win me over,</i>

773
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:50,321
but instead it actually
just made me question

774
00:37:50,424 --> 00:37:52,528
whether Andy was a better option

775
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:54,804
to go home tonight than Sam.

776
00:37:56,286 --> 00:37:58,873
<i>On the one hand, Sam
has played a good game.</i>

777
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,045
<i>He's also the half of this.</i>

778
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:03,976
<i>Genevieve-Sam impenetrable duo,</i>

779
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,562
<i>and that's dangerous for my endgame.</i>

780
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:09,148
<i>On the other hand, I think Andy</i>

781
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:10,976
<i>is playing a much better game</i>

782
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,976
<i>than anyone is giving him credit for.</i>

783
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,080
Andy has pulled the wool over
my eyes three times in this game,

784
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:17,735
and I've fallen for it every time.

785
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,631
So he is doing something right.

786
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:22,424
<i>This vote is very important because</i>

787
00:38:22,528 --> 00:38:26,045
<i>I'm choosing the second
to last member of the jury.</i>

788
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:28,459
<i>And the fun part of this is that I know</i>

789
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:30,286
<i>I'm not actually going home tonight</i>

790
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,838
<i>and that they don't know</i>

791
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,011
<i>that one of them is going home.</i>

792
00:38:34,114 --> 00:38:36,769
<i>I have the most power
that I could possibly have</i>

793
00:38:36,873 --> 00:38:38,907
<i>in this game right now.</i>

794
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:06,217
Now bring in the members of our jury.

795
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,217
All right, let's start

796
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,769
with the last tribal council.

797
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,942
Clearly, a massive blindside.

798
00:39:28,045 --> 00:39:31,631
Teeny, did anybody ever get
to the bottom of what happened?

799
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:33,769
Well, there's been quite a handful

800
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,252
of votes in this game

801
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:37,631
where I haven't known
exactly what was going on.

802
00:39:37,735 --> 00:39:41,528
And yesterday, I felt in a state of delirium

803
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:43,493
because I truly did not understand

804
00:39:43,597 --> 00:39:45,217
how Caroline went home

805
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:47,769
in accordance to the plans
that I had made yesterday.

806
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:49,873
And I feel like

807
00:39:49,976 --> 00:39:52,390
it was almost an
accidental sort of situation

808
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:55,011
that happened. And I
know that's hard to explain

809
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:57,735
and put a finger on, but that's

810
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:00,124
- how I feel it happened.
- Sam, do you concur with that

811
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,666
- it was kind of an accident?
- Yeah, I mean,

812
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:05,459
it feels like there was a lot of
people sort of disconnected on

813
00:40:05,562 --> 00:40:09,355
what their role in a particular plan was.

814
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:12,597
So, like, even those of us
that ended up with our plan

815
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,011
coming to fruition were a bit surprised

816
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:17,700
- at how it came to fruition.
- Jeff,

817
00:40:17,804 --> 00:40:19,114
can I call ...?

818
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,459
- Yeah.
- Andy flipped.

819
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:22,080
- Like, that's what happened.
- Yeah.

820
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:23,883
Like, I don't know why we're
pretending like we don't know

821
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:25,804
what happened. Like...

822
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:27,331
But I had no idea that
Andy was gonna do it.

823
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:28,504
I'm not saying you knew
that that was the vote,

824
00:40:28,528 --> 00:40:30,321
but I'm saying that, like, you guys

825
00:40:30,424 --> 00:40:32,148
were targeting Caroline

826
00:40:32,252 --> 00:40:34,286
and Andy was supposed
to vote Genevieve,

827
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,976
and he voted Caroline. So,

828
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,607
I don't understand where
the confusion is coming from.

829
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:39,804
Does that line up for you, Andy?

830
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:41,355
I think what the confusion

831
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:43,538
that people are talking
about is that there are plans,

832
00:40:43,562 --> 00:40:46,424
and then there's layers
within other plans.

833
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,635
But Rachel was very
direct and simplified it.

834
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:48,976
Yeah.

835
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,114
Did I flip? Yes.

836
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:51,804
So, Rachel,

837
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,459
what was the fallout in the
context of the community,

838
00:40:55,562 --> 00:40:57,080
the tribe dynamic?

839
00:40:57,183 --> 00:40:59,769
What a question, Jeff.

840
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:02,769
Maybe if you would ask me

841
00:41:02,873 --> 00:41:05,321
a different day, I would
have a different answer.

842
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:08,252
But today was my do-or-die day,

843
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:11,666
and without winning that necklace,

844
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,045
everybody that's sitting here except sue

845
00:41:14,148 --> 00:41:16,538
looked me in the eye and
said, "I'm voting for you tonight."

846
00:41:16,562 --> 00:41:19,769
"Like, we have to vote you out
because this and this and this."

847
00:41:19,873 --> 00:41:22,321
And, like, you know, we kind of

848
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:24,355
had a funeral today for me.

849
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:26,459
Andy, is that how it went down for you?

850
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:28,631
Everybody just told
Rachel, "it's you tonight"?

851
00:41:28,735 --> 00:41:32,045
That did happen and,
from my perspective

852
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:34,493
I've lied to Rachel a lot.

853
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:36,838
I've lied to Rachel a lot in this game.

854
00:41:36,942 --> 00:41:38,321
I blindsided her three times.

855
00:41:38,424 --> 00:41:41,286
We've had such up-and-down
strategic relationship,

856
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,804
mostly down, but a really
powerful personal connection.

857
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:47,907
And I look at Rachel and I see

858
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:50,252
an all-around superb <i>survivor</i> player.

859
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:53,011
So, I was just kind of sick of lying to her,

860
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:55,114
even though it's part of the game.

861
00:41:55,217 --> 00:41:57,148
Genevieve, did you share

862
00:41:57,252 --> 00:41:59,666
your personal feelings about Rachel

863
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:02,935
and why you're voting
for her tonight as well?

864
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:03,424
Yeah.

865
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:05,700
And it's because... and
jump in if you disagree

866
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:07,148
like, Rachel and I know

867
00:42:07,252 --> 00:42:09,390
we are on opposite sides of the tribe,

868
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,873
and neither of us were going to bend

869
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:16,045
and neither of us wanted to bs the other.

870
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:17,090
Like, we're like Voldemort
and Harry Potter.

871
00:42:17,114 --> 00:42:21,252
We just, like, can't...
We're weirdly intertwined,

872
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:23,252
but one of us has to die, you know?

873
00:42:23,355 --> 00:42:25,700
But I'm not sitting here
counting Rachel out

874
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:27,390
because Rachel's an amazing player,

875
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:29,080
and something may still happen tonight.

876
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:31,252
So while we had her funeral,

877
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:34,942
she may rise from the
dead and-and come back, so,

878
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:37,735
- I need to vote for Rachel.
- Sam, how about for you?

879
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:40,976
Yeah. I adore Rachel.

880
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,114
We've tried to get our
games to align multiple times,

881
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:46,217
and that hasn't happened.

882
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:48,390
And so at some point, you'd say,

883
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:50,286
"I don't know if I can work with you,

884
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,286
so I have to vote for you."

885
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,286
So, teeny, was there any other layer

886
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,493
this afternoon at camp

887
00:42:56,597 --> 00:42:58,435
or was it just this: "We're
gonna all tell Rachel"

888
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:00,804
"she's too good, she's
going home, and then

889
00:43:00,907 --> 00:43:03,147
the community will decide
what's gonna happen tomorrow"?

890
00:43:03,183 --> 00:43:05,942
I think a big part of this decision

891
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:07,597
is having awareness of your own game

892
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,217
and your own strengths
going into this end portion.

893
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,666
You know, we have one more vote

894
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:13,252
before it comes down to fire-making.

895
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:15,804
I know my own skill set. I know Rachel's.

896
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:17,947
Rachel is going to beat
me in fire if we get there.

897
00:43:18,011 --> 00:43:19,942
So, it would be foolish for me

898
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:21,562
to sit next to her in that position.

899
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,183
Sue, did you partake in this?

900
00:43:24,286 --> 00:43:26,562
Well, I'm-I'm the opposite
end of the spectrum.

901
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:29,148
Just like with Gabe and Caroline,

902
00:43:29,252 --> 00:43:30,804
I am not voting for Rachel.

903
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:33,700
Everybody else knows that as well.

904
00:43:33,804 --> 00:43:37,217
So, Rachel, if this is
true, and it's you tonight,

905
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:41,286
you spent 23 days in the jungles of Fiji.

906
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,493
- What do you take from this?
- I mean,

907
00:43:43,597 --> 00:43:45,400
this is something that
I've been dreaming about

908
00:43:45,424 --> 00:43:48,080
for years, and...

909
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:50,252
It's been everything
I ever wanted it to be.

910
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:52,080
And I think the coolest part about, like,

911
00:43:52,183 --> 00:43:54,666
turning that corner where I was just

912
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:56,769
allowing myself the freedom to really play

913
00:43:56,873 --> 00:43:58,597
is that I started to actually have fun.

914
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,252
There was, like, a levity to it,

915
00:44:00,355 --> 00:44:02,769
talking and laughing
and just slowing down.

916
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,114
And as I had a better time,

917
00:44:05,217 --> 00:44:07,737
everyone else seemed to
respond to me a little bit better, too.

918
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:10,011
And so, maybe I don't need

919
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,562
to pack so much into
my life back at home,

920
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:15,873
and it will be just as fulfilling, if not more,

921
00:44:15,976 --> 00:44:19,114
is really what I've taken
away from this experience.

922
00:44:21,873 --> 00:44:25,804
All right, it is time to
vote. Teeny, you're up.

923
00:44:36,528 --> 00:44:39,459
You're an incredible all-around player,

924
00:44:39,562 --> 00:44:42,080
<i>entirely deserving of your threat level.</i>

925
00:45:00,355 --> 00:45:02,769
"return to your seat."

926
00:45:20,183 --> 00:45:22,045
I'll go tally the votes.

927
00:45:36,355 --> 00:45:38,321
If anybody has an advantage or an idol

928
00:45:38,424 --> 00:45:41,390
and you want to play it, now
would be the time to do so.

929
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:47,838
You know, Jeff...

930
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,252
Think the only thing better than

931
00:45:53,355 --> 00:45:55,080
attending your own funeral

932
00:45:55,183 --> 00:45:57,583
is knowing that you're gonna
wake up alive the next morning.

933
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,700
I'd like to play it for myself, please.

934
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,907
Thank you.

935
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:25,011
This is a hidden immunity idol.

936
00:46:26,355 --> 00:46:28,976
- Any votes cast for Rachel will not count.
- Wow.

937
00:46:31,148 --> 00:46:34,011
I'll read the votes.

938
00:46:37,976 --> 00:46:41,011
Rachel. Does not count.

939
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:50,045
Rachel. Does not count.

940
00:46:55,183 --> 00:46:58,390
Rachel. Does not count.

941
00:47:07,735 --> 00:47:09,700
Andy. That's one vote Andy.

942
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:23,700
Thirteenth person voted out
and the sixth member of our jury.

943
00:47:23,804 --> 00:47:25,976
Nice. Andy. Need to bring me your torch.

944
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,252
It's all good. I'm-I'm
honored. I'm honored.

945
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:55,700
Andy, the tribe has spoken.

946
00:47:57,735 --> 00:47:59,676
- Time for you to go.
- Good game. Good game, y'all.

947
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,060
- Good game. Good game. - Bye.
- Bye, Andy. Good job, Andy.

948
00:48:21,183 --> 00:48:22,942
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

949
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:24,631
Good night.

950
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:32,390
I got idoled out in <i>survivor.</i>

951
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:35,907
<i>But after the start I had in this game,</i>

952
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:37,355
<i>I have my head held high.</i>

953
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,700
<i>It's just an unbelievable transformation</i>

954
00:48:39,804 --> 00:48:43,528
<i>that I've had over these 23 days.</i>

955
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:46,286
And I'm gonna take it with me, you know,

956
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,590
for the rest of my life,
and definitely for the better.

957
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:06,321
<i>That was a huge tribal for me.</i>

958
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:10,942
<i>I finally was the one that
knew what was going on,</i>

959
00:49:11,045 --> 00:49:12,838
and basically, no one else did.

960
00:49:12,942 --> 00:49:16,045
And it was fun. Like, I had a blast with it.

961
00:49:16,148 --> 00:49:19,183
- That was a great job.
- Great job, Rachel.

962
00:49:19,286 --> 00:49:21,011
Rachel with the first idol play

963
00:49:21,114 --> 00:49:22,597
of the post-jury phase of the game.

964
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,907
Great job, Rachel.

965
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:25,651
- Rachel...
- How long have you had that?

966
00:49:28,045 --> 00:49:29,217
Shut up.

967
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,331
- Can you explain, though.
- I would love to share,

968
00:49:33,355 --> 00:49:34,700
but I also...

969
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:41,252
<i>The emotion during that tribal was</i>

970
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:44,286
mostly just, like, glee.

971
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,562
<i>We had my funeral procession</i>

972
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:50,114
<i>and little did they know that</i>

973
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:53,217
<i>I had an idol in my pocket, and</i>

974
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:55,873
I would wake up on this beach tomorrow.

975
00:49:55,976 --> 00:49:59,321
<i>My clue</i> was in my
French fries at the auction.

976
00:49:59,424 --> 00:50:01,528
That is amazing.

977
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,111
I'm very curious where you got yours.

978
00:50:09,942 --> 00:50:11,642
- What? What?!
- You're frick... No, you're lying.

979
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:12,786
- No frickin' way.
- My god.

980
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:17,355
So... <i>So my idol is totally fake,</i>

981
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:20,562
<i>and only Sam is left in the
game that knows it is fake.</i>

982
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:22,252
<i>So,</i>

983
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:26,148
I guess the age-old advice
of "fake it till you make it" can

984
00:50:26,252 --> 00:50:27,735
<i>even work in</i> survivor.

985
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:29,607
<i>You just have to fan
those flames a little bit,</i>

986
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:32,355
<i>and before you know it,</i>

987
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:34,321
everyone's believing you've got an idol.

988
00:50:34,424 --> 00:50:36,193
I wanted to have the
necklace today so that I could

989
00:50:36,217 --> 00:50:37,493
play my idol tomorrow.

990
00:50:37,597 --> 00:50:39,700
You winning today was
my worst-case scenario.

991
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:41,597
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel,

992
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,676
but I'm gonna have to try
and win tomorrow now, too,

993
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,366
yeah, samesies.

994
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:46,540
Because I still have a
Rachel problem in this game.

995
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:48,493
<i>Genevieve and I have kind of been</i>

996
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:50,148
<i>dancing around each other.</i>

997
00:50:50,252 --> 00:50:53,217
<i>We both recognized each
other the second we merged.</i>

998
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:54,562
<i>I never trusted her</i>

999
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:56,493
<i>and she never trusted
me because I think</i>

1000
00:50:56,597 --> 00:51:00,562
like just recognized
like, and we just knew

1001
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:03,562
that we were gonna be
adversaries in this game.

1002
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,597
I should not care about getting firewood.

1003
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,355
I know.

1004
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:14,424
<i>Rachel and I don't
bother hiding the fact that</i>

1005
00:51:14,528 --> 00:51:15,804
we want each other out.

1006
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,528
<i>I definitely look at her</i>

1007
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,631
<i>as someone who I
don't want to sit next to.</i>

1008
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:22,080
<i>I think she will win the game,</i>

1009
00:51:22,183 --> 00:51:24,907
<i>and it sounds like she
may feel similarly about me.</i>

1010
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:28,217
And so, it really is one
of those situations where

1011
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:31,114
<i>this island isn't big
enough for the both of us.</i>

1012
00:51:31,217 --> 00:51:33,735
<i>And so, it's Genevieve vs. Rachel.</i>

1013
00:52:00,424 --> 00:52:02,666
What time do you think she went out?

1014
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:04,355
- I mean...
- I mean...

1015
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:06,114
Yeah, she might already have it.

1016
00:52:06,217 --> 00:52:08,217
Let's find out.

1017
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:12,597
Day 24. It's about time

1018
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,045
we search someone's bag for stuff.

1019
00:52:15,148 --> 00:52:17,217
- Check the pockets.
- Yeah.

1020
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:19,942
Nothing there.

1021
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:22,769
Nothing there.

1022
00:52:23,804 --> 00:52:26,976
<i>As happy as I am to have
made it through tribal council,</i>

1023
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,907
I am so irritated

1024
00:52:29,011 --> 00:52:30,976
that Rachel is still in this game.

1025
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,528
I have been targeting
her <i>for days and days now,</i>

1026
00:52:35,631 --> 00:52:36,942
<i>and she's still here.</i>

1027
00:52:37,045 --> 00:52:39,217
Got to make sure there's no surprises.

1028
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:40,907
Last night was not fun.

1029
00:52:41,011 --> 00:52:42,838
<i>Because Rachel played an idol,</i>

1030
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:44,976
<i>I have to think there is
one out here somewhere.</i>

1031
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,528
<i>And I know, for me,</i> I
can't let Rachel get it.

1032
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,183
I don't think it would be in her bag.

1033
00:52:53,286 --> 00:52:56,148
<i>Everyone is thinking that
there is another idol out there,</i>

1034
00:52:56,252 --> 00:52:59,424
<i>and I'm, like, the smart one,
keeping my mouth shut that</i>

1035
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:01,459
I have a hidden immunity idol.

1036
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,700
- Yeah.
- She's got it, it'll be on her.

1037
00:53:05,804 --> 00:53:09,217
<i>This has been my theme
this whole time from day one.</i>

1038
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:12,838
<i>I know everyone's gonna</i>
freakin' underestimate me.

1039
00:53:12,942 --> 00:53:15,286
And none of 'em would even think

1040
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,700
<i>that I would have an idol.</i>

1041
00:53:16,804 --> 00:53:18,193
<i>I freakin' made it to the final five</i>

1042
00:53:18,217 --> 00:53:21,114
<i>with an idol in my pocket.</i>

1043
00:53:21,217 --> 00:53:23,942
Isn't it crazy? Isn't this freakin' crazy?

1044
00:53:27,355 --> 00:53:28,642
She's had a lot of good luck in this game.

1045
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,355
- Yeah.
- She has.

1046
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:33,114
If she wins today, it's, like, damn.

1047
00:53:33,217 --> 00:53:36,011
<i>I genuinely love this battle with Rachel.</i>

1048
00:53:36,114 --> 00:53:37,942
To have Rachel and I as, like,

1049
00:53:38,045 --> 00:53:40,390
two sort of similar professional women

1050
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:42,873
<i>in their 30s going against each other</i>

1051
00:53:42,976 --> 00:53:46,355
<i>it makes me feel really good about</i>

1052
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:48,183
season 47 of <i>survivor.</i>

1053
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:54,252
I can't see anything.

1054
00:53:59,597 --> 00:54:01,424
<i>It's a little awkward
when I have to kind of</i>

1055
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:03,493
follow her around camp because

1056
00:54:03,597 --> 00:54:06,011
<i>if she finds an idol, it's
gonna be a problem for me.</i>

1057
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:08,114
<i>So, babysitting Rachel feels a little icky.</i>

1058
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:09,769
I hate having to do it to her,

1059
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:12,183
but I'm pretty open about the fact that,

1060
00:54:12,286 --> 00:54:14,873
<i>"I'm sorry, Rachel. I have
to follow you everywhere</i>

1061
00:54:14,976 --> 00:54:16,745
and make sure you lose
today and vote you out."

1062
00:54:16,769 --> 00:54:19,011
If you find a second idol

1063
00:54:19,114 --> 00:54:21,114
I swear to god, Genevieve...

1064
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:23,080
It's a fun relationship
we have in this game.

1065
00:54:23,183 --> 00:54:25,114
The best frenemy I could have asked for.

1066
00:54:25,217 --> 00:54:27,700
Agreed.

1067
00:54:27,804 --> 00:54:29,907
<i>Genevieve and I will
be going head-to-head,</i>

1068
00:54:30,011 --> 00:54:32,045
<i>but I'm happy to have somebody</i>

1069
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:35,390
that I feel like I really genuinely respect

1070
00:54:35,493 --> 00:54:37,390
<i>to, like, showdown with in this game.</i>

1071
00:54:37,493 --> 00:54:38,873
<i>We are going</i>

1072
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:41,804
to clash, and we're gonna
see who comes out alive.

1073
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:43,090
Here's my question. If neither of us

1074
00:54:43,114 --> 00:54:44,390
make it to the end, who wins?

1075
00:54:45,597 --> 00:54:46,631
Sam.

1076
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:49,769
I'm so proud of us.

1077
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:51,562
- Final five. Like...
- Twenty-four. 24.

1078
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:54,183
I will never get over it in my life.

1079
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:55,642
- Like, this is just insane.
- Crazy.

1080
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:57,011
Twenty-four.

1081
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,597
Tonight's the last time we vote.

1082
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,528
Okay. So, what bothers
me is that, last night,

1083
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:07,573
when they both came back,
they're just - the two... the two of them

1084
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:09,538
coming back here talking about
how great each other are...-!

1085
00:55:09,562 --> 00:55:11,838
Dude! To me, that's... I
can't stand showboating.

1086
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,642
Like, sitting in front of
the other three people

1087
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,146
being like, "one of us is gonna win."

1088
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:16,607
- Like they're so confident.
- Like, I was like,

1089
00:55:16,631 --> 00:55:18,907
"you're really, like, that
sure that we all suck?"

1090
00:55:19,011 --> 00:55:20,631
- Yeah.
- That's exactly how I felt.

1091
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,666
"Do you see that we're
sitting here with you?"

1092
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:25,355
<i>I'm very annoyed at
Rachel and Genevieve</i>

1093
00:55:25,459 --> 00:55:26,849
<i>literally thinking they're the big threats,</i>

1094
00:55:26,873 --> 00:55:28,528
<i>they're the big dogs.</i>

1095
00:55:28,631 --> 00:55:30,469
<i>How they've done this, how
they've done that, and they're</i>

1096
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,390
just ready to Duke it out together.

1097
00:55:32,493 --> 00:55:33,873
There's three other people

1098
00:55:33,976 --> 00:55:35,631
<i>still in existence here.</i>

1099
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:36,976
Like, what about us?

1100
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,597
They think

1101
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,528
it's only now a game
between the two of them.

1102
00:55:40,631 --> 00:55:40,927
Yes.

1103
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:43,562
And whichever one of
them gets to the end wins.

1104
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:43,927
Yeah.

1105
00:55:43,951 --> 00:55:45,826
And I actually just don't think that's true.

1106
00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:49,011
Me too.

1107
00:55:49,114 --> 00:55:51,080
Yeah, it kind of made me mad.

1108
00:55:51,183 --> 00:55:54,217
<i>Genevieve and Rachel
have been talking about how</i>

1109
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:56,252
<i>they're the two best players,</i>

1110
00:55:56,355 --> 00:55:58,355
<i>one of them is surely
gonna win the season.</i>

1111
00:55:58,459 --> 00:56:01,114
<i>Okay, we'll see about that.</i>

1112
00:56:01,217 --> 00:56:04,045
If I have anything to say about
it, that's not gonna happen.

1113
00:56:19,528 --> 00:56:21,114
Come on in!

1114
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:30,321
There they are.

1115
00:56:30,424 --> 00:56:32,252
Final five.

1116
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:35,390
What's left of the community.

1117
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:43,735
So, here we are, day 24.

1118
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:47,045
In your final five challenge, arguably

1119
00:56:47,148 --> 00:56:50,183
the biggest and most important
challenge of the season,

1120
00:56:50,286 --> 00:56:52,080
because if you win this challenge,

1121
00:56:52,183 --> 00:56:53,528
you can't be voted out tonight,

1122
00:56:53,631 --> 00:56:55,907
which means you can't
be voted out of this game.

1123
00:56:56,011 --> 00:56:59,838
At the very least, you
got a shot at making fire.

1124
00:56:59,942 --> 00:57:01,883
So, no matter what happens
in the final four challenge,

1125
00:57:01,907 --> 00:57:04,183
you have that certainty. Big stakes.

1126
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:05,493
Shall we get to it?

1127
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:06,918
All right, first things first, Genevieve.

1128
00:57:06,942 --> 00:57:09,183
- Got to take back the necklace.
- Yes, sir.

1129
00:57:10,217 --> 00:57:11,562
Thank you.

1130
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,321
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

1131
00:57:19,424 --> 00:57:21,124
For today's challenge,
you're gonna race in

1132
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:23,080
<i>from the ocean,</i>

1133
00:57:23,183 --> 00:57:25,217
<i>dig through a massive pile of sand</i>

1134
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:26,907
<i>to get under a log.</i>

1135
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:29,838
<i>You're then gonna balance
on a wobbly beam while using</i>

1136
00:57:29,942 --> 00:57:33,252
<i>a long pole to stack balls on stands.</i>

1137
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:37,355
<i>If your stack drops, got to start again.</i>

1138
00:57:37,459 --> 00:57:39,873
<i>First player to stack six balls</i>

1139
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:43,873
wins immunity,

1140
00:57:43,976 --> 00:57:46,493
is guaranteed a spot in the final four.

1141
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:49,735
Losers, tribal council,
where somebody will be

1142
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:51,286
the 14th person voted out,

1143
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:54,942
become the seventh member of our jury.

1144
00:57:56,252 --> 00:57:58,045
Let's do it. We'll get it on. Here we go.

1145
00:58:06,252 --> 00:58:08,217
All right, here we go.

1146
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:11,217
For immunity and a spot in the final four

1147
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,045
of <i>survivor</i> 47.

1148
00:58:14,148 --> 00:58:15,597
Survivors ready?

1149
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:18,745
Go!

1150
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:20,528
First it is a sprint,

1151
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:24,183
which on day 24 is more
difficult than it sounds.

1152
00:58:24,286 --> 00:58:26,286
Look at that... teeny and Sam.

1153
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,493
Here comes sue, then
Rachel, then Genevieve.

1154
00:58:28,597 --> 00:58:30,321
Now you got to dig through that sand.

1155
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,666
It's a big pile of sand,

1156
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:34,329
and you want to get through it quickly.

1157
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:36,390
You know how these challenges go.

1158
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:39,907
Sometimes it comes
down to a few seconds,

1159
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:42,631
so every handful of
sand you get matters.

1160
00:58:42,735 --> 00:58:44,942
Sue is through first.

1161
00:58:46,562 --> 00:58:47,666
Here comes Sam.

1162
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:49,080
Here comes teeny.

1163
00:58:50,942 --> 00:58:52,700
Rachel's through.

1164
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:57,873
Genevieve in dead last through the sand.

1165
00:58:57,976 --> 00:59:01,528
Now you're gonna stack balls on stands.

1166
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:04,321
You got to approach from the back,

1167
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:06,424
- whoa...
- Walk up that wobbly stand,

1168
00:59:06,528 --> 00:59:10,148
and then gently place
a ball and then a stand.

1169
00:59:12,597 --> 00:59:14,666
- Here comes Genevieve.
- Hate the sand.

1170
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,355
Sue has one ball and one stand.

1171
00:59:21,459 --> 00:59:24,252
Rachel with her first ball and stand.

1172
00:59:24,355 --> 00:59:27,873
Here comes Genevieve with her first ball.

1173
00:59:27,976 --> 00:59:29,459
These early ones are easy.

1174
00:59:29,562 --> 00:59:32,562
You got to use these early balls

1175
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:34,907
and stands to train yourself

1176
00:59:35,011 --> 00:59:38,114
to learn, "how do I want to stack them?"

1177
00:59:38,217 --> 00:59:39,873
Anticipate what's coming,

1178
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:42,838
which is six balls total.

1179
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:45,045
And just like this game,

1180
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,114
the longer you get into this challenge,

1181
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:49,528
the higher that becomes,
the more precarious.

1182
00:59:51,873 --> 00:59:54,424
Sue drops, got to start again.

1183
00:59:54,528 --> 00:59:56,390
Sam loses everything.

1184
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:57,735
Got to clear the whole deck.

1185
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:01,011
If you drop, everything comes off.

1186
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,390
Genevieve places another ball.

1187
01:00:04,493 --> 01:00:06,528
Rachel places another ball.

1188
01:00:06,631 --> 01:00:08,355
Damn. No.

1189
01:00:08,459 --> 01:00:10,080
It is Genevieve gonna lose everything.

1190
01:00:10,183 --> 01:00:12,528
It's now Rachel in the lead.

1191
01:00:12,631 --> 01:00:15,735
Rachel loses everything.
Now it's teeny in the lead.

1192
01:00:16,873 --> 01:00:19,700
Teeny drops. We're
virtually starting again.

1193
01:00:19,804 --> 01:00:22,700
This is one of those challenges
that's gonna be maddening.

1194
01:00:22,804 --> 01:00:25,804
You're gonna make
progress, it's gonna drop.

1195
01:00:25,907 --> 01:00:27,355
But if you're playing smart,

1196
01:00:27,459 --> 01:00:30,700
you're paying attention
to what you did wrong.

1197
01:00:30,804 --> 01:00:32,528
Everybody's gonna drop.

1198
01:00:32,631 --> 01:00:34,493
This is about learning how to get better

1199
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:39,183
at this specific, weird <i>survivor</i> challenge.

1200
01:00:58,252 --> 01:01:02,286
Genevieve... Places her fourth ball.

1201
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:06,769
It's Genevieve in the
lead, by a bit, over Rachel.

1202
01:01:06,873 --> 01:01:09,045
Genevieve on one
end, Rachel on the other.

1203
01:01:09,148 --> 01:01:12,114
Right now, in a battle for immunity.

1204
01:01:12,217 --> 01:01:14,528
Rachel places her fourth ball.

1205
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:17,597
Genevieve has her
fourth ball and a stand.

1206
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,355
So it's Genevieve in the
lead, Rachel trying to catch her.

1207
01:01:20,459 --> 01:01:22,459
It's another familiar situation.

1208
01:01:22,562 --> 01:01:25,080
Do you want to press it, try to catch,

1209
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:27,090
or you're gonna wait for
them to fall and just keep

1210
01:01:27,114 --> 01:01:28,424
with your game?

1211
01:01:28,528 --> 01:01:30,700
Genevieve placing her fifth ball.

1212
01:01:30,804 --> 01:01:33,493
There are only six total.
You've got a fifth ball,

1213
01:01:33,597 --> 01:01:35,873
- let go.
- Then a stand and a final ball,

1214
01:01:35,976 --> 01:01:37,666
if you can get it to stay.

1215
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:40,735
Rachel places her fifth ball.

1216
01:01:42,148 --> 01:01:44,114
Rachel loses everything.

1217
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:46,390
The smallest vibration
on that platform can do it.

1218
01:01:46,493 --> 01:01:48,976
- No. I...
- Genevieve drops.

1219
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,424
It's now Sam.

1220
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:52,286
Sam drops.

1221
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:55,769
We're starting again.
Everybody is in this.

1222
01:01:55,873 --> 01:01:59,183
You cannot give up.
You got to dig in again.

1223
01:02:03,873 --> 01:02:04,907
Nope.

1224
01:02:18,942 --> 01:02:20,562
Rachel back out with her fifth ball.

1225
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:24,045
Here comes Genevieve with her fifth.

1226
01:02:24,148 --> 01:02:25,838
There are only six total.

1227
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:29,355
We're back to a duel on the corners.

1228
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:31,045
Rachel and Genevieve

1229
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:34,769
have been making more and
more progress every round.

1230
01:02:34,873 --> 01:02:38,011
That's encouraging, but
it doesn't get you the win.

1231
01:02:38,114 --> 01:02:39,700
You've got to finish.

1232
01:02:39,804 --> 01:02:42,011
It is Rachel right now coming
back with her last stand.

1233
01:02:42,114 --> 01:02:45,424
Then one more ball,
and immunity is hers.

1234
01:02:47,148 --> 01:02:49,148
Genevieve one ball behind.

1235
01:02:50,321 --> 01:02:51,942
Genevieve continuing to dig,

1236
01:02:52,045 --> 01:02:54,493
hoping for a drop from Rachel.

1237
01:02:56,286 --> 01:02:59,148
Here comes Rachel with
the sixth and final ball,

1238
01:02:59,252 --> 01:03:03,804
guaranteeing her a spot in the final four.

1239
01:03:03,907 --> 01:03:07,424
Genevieve trying to catch
her, hoping for disaster.

1240
01:03:07,528 --> 01:03:10,390
It's happened before.
Can it happen again?

1241
01:03:11,424 --> 01:03:12,424
It would be Rachel's

1242
01:03:12,528 --> 01:03:15,631
third individual immunity win.

1243
01:03:17,286 --> 01:03:18,735
Here comes Genevieve.

1244
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:21,666
One stand and one ball.

1245
01:03:27,045 --> 01:03:29,045
Rachel placing that ball.

1246
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:36,045
It's dancing around.

1247
01:03:40,838 --> 01:03:42,838
Genevieve places her final stand.

1248
01:03:42,942 --> 01:03:44,804
She has one ball left.

1249
01:03:44,907 --> 01:03:47,286
Rachel's placed the sixth ball.

1250
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,228
Now she's trying to
get that pole out of there

1251
01:03:49,252 --> 01:03:50,562
without touching anything.

1252
01:03:50,666 --> 01:03:51,952
Then she has to get off the stand

1253
01:03:51,976 --> 01:03:53,700
and back to the platform.

1254
01:03:53,804 --> 01:03:56,700
Genevieve right on her tail.

1255
01:03:57,769 --> 01:03:59,286
Rachel trying to keep that ball

1256
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:02,528
- don't worry.
- And stack in place.

1257
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,631
Can she do it?

1258
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,735
Genevieve drops and loses everything!

1259
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:21,804
It is now Rachel's challenge to win.

1260
01:04:21,907 --> 01:04:23,390
All eyes on Rachel right now.

1261
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:26,148
Does she have it?

1262
01:04:31,045 --> 01:04:33,873
- You go, girl.
- And she does. It's over!

1263
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:37,838
Rachel has won her third
individual immunity, - so proud of you.

1264
01:04:37,942 --> 01:04:40,056
- Guaranteeing herself a spot.
- You did it, you did it, you did it.

1265
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,114
- In the final four.
- You did it.

1266
01:04:42,217 --> 01:04:44,976
Wow, what a challenge.

1267
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,080
Well done.

1268
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,424
Good job.

1269
01:04:51,528 --> 01:04:53,942
Well done, Rachel.

1270
01:04:54,045 --> 01:04:56,011
Good job.

1271
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:05,769
Rachel, come on over.

1272
01:05:05,873 --> 01:05:07,321
Good job, Rachel.

1273
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,252
Beka woman.

1274
01:05:10,355 --> 01:05:13,459
For the third time,
individual immunity is yours.

1275
01:05:13,562 --> 01:05:15,080
Means you are safe tonight,

1276
01:05:15,183 --> 01:05:17,080
guaranteed a spot in the final four.

1277
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:18,873
You cannot be voted out of this game.

1278
01:05:18,976 --> 01:05:21,459
- Thank god, Jeff.
- At the very least,

1279
01:05:21,562 --> 01:05:23,918
you've earned yourself a spot
in the fire-making challenge.

1280
01:05:23,942 --> 01:05:25,183
As for the rest of you,

1281
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:28,183
tonight the dream will end for one of you.

1282
01:05:28,286 --> 01:05:31,183
Fourteenth person voted out,
seventh member of our jury.

1283
01:05:31,286 --> 01:05:32,700
It won't be you. Congrats.

1284
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,262
Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight of tribal.

1285
01:05:34,286 --> 01:05:36,459
- Thanks, Jeff. Can I have a hug?
- Of course.

1286
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:37,976
Well done.

1287
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:41,321
<i>I'm incredibly bummed</i>

1288
01:05:41,424 --> 01:05:43,873
<i>that Rachel has won the challenge.</i>

1289
01:05:43,976 --> 01:05:45,804
<i>Had anyone else won,</i>

1290
01:05:45,907 --> 01:05:47,873
<i>she would have been
going home tonight.</i>

1291
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:49,528
<i>And now that's not happening.</i>

1292
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:52,424
<i>So the best thing I can think of is</i>

1293
01:05:52,528 --> 01:05:55,390
<i>I've got this fake idol that
everyone is afraid is real.</i>

1294
01:05:55,493 --> 01:06:00,321
<i>So,</i> it's not over yet. It's not over yet.

1295
01:06:16,493 --> 01:06:18,528
- Thank you.
- Go, Rachel!

1296
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:23,045
<i>My god.</i>

1297
01:06:23,148 --> 01:06:26,080
I won immunity when
I needed it so badly.

1298
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:28,493
- That was a tough one.
- I needed it. I knew I needed it.

1299
01:06:28,597 --> 01:06:31,355
Great for you. Great for you, Rachel.

1300
01:06:31,459 --> 01:06:33,435
Genevieve, you're playing
your idol for yourself tonight?

1301
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:34,700
We shall see.

1302
01:06:34,804 --> 01:06:36,252
<i>The last couple days,</i>

1303
01:06:36,355 --> 01:06:38,148
<i>I've been carrying around this rivalry</i>

1304
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:40,045
<i>between Genevieve and me.</i>

1305
01:06:40,148 --> 01:06:43,976
<i>And knowing that she's
secure tonight with her idol</i>

1306
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,700
<i>and knowing that I was
backed completely into a corner,</i>

1307
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:51,562
drove me today to get it done.

1308
01:06:52,562 --> 01:06:55,804
Never in a million years thought
that that would be the case.

1309
01:06:55,907 --> 01:06:57,469
I tried to tell 'em at, like, the final nine,

1310
01:06:57,493 --> 01:07:00,217
but nobody wanted to
listen to little old Sam.

1311
01:07:00,321 --> 01:07:02,355
That I was gonna do well?

1312
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:04,228
That you were gonna win the
game if we didn't vote you out.

1313
01:07:04,252 --> 01:07:05,493
What?!

1314
01:07:05,597 --> 01:07:06,666
- Yeah.
- You did not.

1315
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:08,080
Swear.

1316
01:07:08,183 --> 01:07:10,114
<i>Rachel wins immunity, her third win.</i>

1317
01:07:10,217 --> 01:07:13,390
<i>The most defeating
of them all to this point.</i>

1318
01:07:13,493 --> 01:07:15,804
<i>Rachel's got her ticket to the final four,</i>

1319
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:19,355
and my path to winning this
game got a lot more complicated.

1320
01:07:19,459 --> 01:07:23,183
<i>If everybody believes Genevieve is safe,</i>

1321
01:07:23,286 --> 01:07:25,286
I'm probably the most likely target.

1322
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:28,286
<i>But I know Genevieve's idol is fake,</i>

1323
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:29,873
<i>because I helped her make it.</i>

1324
01:07:29,976 --> 01:07:33,700
<i>And so, as close as I am with Genevieve,</i>

1325
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:37,114
<i>with Rachel immune,</i>
Genevieve has to go tonight.

1326
01:07:39,873 --> 01:07:41,700
I might be making

1327
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:43,769
a million-dollar mistake right now,

1328
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:45,355
but I'm gonna do it anyway.

1329
01:07:45,459 --> 01:07:47,459
And you might not believe me.

1330
01:07:49,011 --> 01:07:50,942
Genevieve's idol is fake.

1331
01:07:51,045 --> 01:07:53,045
- Seriously?
- I-I made it with her.

1332
01:07:53,148 --> 01:07:55,666
- Seriously?
- At the final seven.

1333
01:07:55,769 --> 01:07:57,252
We made it on the reward.

1334
01:07:59,355 --> 01:08:00,976
- Wow.
- So...

1335
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,804
- So she has...
- She doesn't have an idol?

1336
01:08:02,907 --> 01:08:05,321
Genevieve does not have an idol tonight.

1337
01:08:05,424 --> 01:08:07,538
- A hundred percent confirmed?
- One million percent.

1338
01:08:07,562 --> 01:08:10,080
I made that thing with
her, and Andy knew that.

1339
01:08:10,183 --> 01:08:13,528
We showed it to him on the
reward, which got him to flip.

1340
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,459
That make-that makes everything
make so much more sense.

1341
01:08:16,562 --> 01:08:19,321
Everything makes so much
more... thank you for that.

1342
01:08:19,424 --> 01:08:21,286
<i>I can tell teeny's mind is melting.</i>

1343
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:26,355
<i>I see her realize</i> in real time, "crap.

1344
01:08:26,459 --> 01:08:29,562
I've known nothing about what's
actually going on in this game."

1345
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:35,045
<i>I see confusion, I see betrayal, I see fear.</i>

1346
01:08:35,148 --> 01:08:37,562
And that's kind of the
exact reaction I'm hoping for.

1347
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:39,804
I'm hoping that teeny will feel

1348
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:42,631
so betrayed by Genevieve,

1349
01:08:42,735 --> 01:08:46,114
so thankful to me for
finally coming clean that

1350
01:08:46,217 --> 01:08:48,631
<i>there will be no doubt in
her mind what has to happen.</i>

1351
01:08:48,735 --> 01:08:51,148
Genevieve has to go home.

1352
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,355
<i>So, we could get Genevieve tonight?</i>

1353
01:08:53,459 --> 01:08:56,355
We probably would have
to convince Rachel and sue

1354
01:08:56,459 --> 01:08:58,183
that it really is a fake idol.

1355
01:08:58,286 --> 01:09:00,252
And then get them to vote on Genevieve.

1356
01:09:01,286 --> 01:09:02,666
<i>Wow!</i>

1357
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,700
I actually can't even get
myself to think straight.

1358
01:09:07,735 --> 01:09:09,459
<i>My brain can't catch up</i>

1359
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,148
<i>to all the things that I need</i>

1360
01:09:12,252 --> 01:09:15,321
to unlearn about what
I thought was going on.

1361
01:09:19,148 --> 01:09:22,562
<i>There was no clue under a pizza slice.</i>

1362
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:25,183
<i>Genevieve's idol</i> is fake.

1363
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,528
It was never real.

1364
01:09:26,631 --> 01:09:28,907
<i>I'm literally rewinding the tapes</i>

1365
01:09:29,011 --> 01:09:31,597
<i>on every conversation that I've had,</i>

1366
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:38,873
<i>and every opportunity</i>

1367
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:41,907
<i>that I've let Genevieve
trick me and trick me.</i>

1368
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,769
Me and Genevieve are voting...

1369
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:46,873
<i>And it goes all the way back to...</i>

1370
01:09:46,976 --> 01:09:49,493
Fourth person voted out of kishan.

1371
01:09:49,597 --> 01:09:50,837
<i>Genevieve voting out kishan.</i>

1372
01:09:50,873 --> 01:09:52,459
<i>I don't understand</i>

1373
01:09:52,562 --> 01:09:53,745
how they got the numbers to do you.

1374
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:55,321
No. What is happening?

1375
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,252
<i>Then Genevieve decided to get sol out.</i>

1376
01:09:57,355 --> 01:09:58,907
The tribe has spoken.

1377
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,700
Why?

1378
01:10:07,148 --> 01:10:09,183
<i>Then Sam, Andy and Genevieve</i>

1379
01:10:09,286 --> 01:10:11,631
<i>concocted one of the most intricate</i>

1380
01:10:11,735 --> 01:10:13,562
<i>missions of this game:</i>

1381
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,045
Operation Italy...

1382
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:17,252
Twelfth person voted out of <i>survivor</i> 47:

1383
01:10:17,355 --> 01:10:19,080
Caroline.

1384
01:10:19,183 --> 01:10:20,838
<i>Fooling me and getting Caroline out.</i>

1385
01:10:20,942 --> 01:10:21,942
The tribe has spoken.

1386
01:10:23,562 --> 01:10:28,114
<i>And I fell into every single trap.</i>

1387
01:10:28,217 --> 01:10:31,390
<i>How could I have been so stupid?</i>

1388
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:33,666
If her idol is fake,

1389
01:10:33,769 --> 01:10:35,056
and I've been granted
the knowledge of that,

1390
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,597
I would be a fool not
to eliminate Genevieve

1391
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,286
and end this chapter of her fooling me

1392
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:42,631
with me getting the last word.

1393
01:10:42,735 --> 01:10:44,873
What if I told you
Genevieve wasn't safe?

1394
01:10:44,976 --> 01:10:46,355
The idol's fake.

1395
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:50,011
Sam told me that Andy, him
and Genevieve made the idol.

1396
01:10:52,321 --> 01:10:55,217
You think she told him to tell you that?

1397
01:10:55,321 --> 01:10:57,459
- 'Cause they're scamming something.
- Yeah.

1398
01:10:57,562 --> 01:11:00,217
It's just a little bit fishy.

1399
01:11:00,321 --> 01:11:02,804
<i>If Genevieve's idol is fake</i>

1400
01:11:02,907 --> 01:11:05,390
<i>and Sam wants us to load our votes</i>

1401
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:07,528
<i>onto Genevieve, that would leave</i>

1402
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:09,976
sue, myself and teeny
voting for Genevieve.

1403
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,493
Which means that <i>if
the idol is actually real,</i>

1404
01:11:13,597 --> 01:11:15,528
<i>and Genevieve plays her idol on herself,</i>

1405
01:11:15,631 --> 01:11:18,735
<i>now whoever Genevieve
and Sam voted for</i>

1406
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:19,942
is voted out.

1407
01:11:22,907 --> 01:11:24,390
So I should take her, or...

1408
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,459
Let-let's not make any decisions yet.

1409
01:11:26,562 --> 01:11:27,922
- I know. I know.
- Let's-let's...

1410
01:11:27,976 --> 01:11:29,838
- Let's breathe.
- Get more information.

1411
01:11:29,942 --> 01:11:31,286
- Let's breathe.
- Yeah.

1412
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:33,700
<i>I don't believe it. There's a big chance</i>

1413
01:11:33,804 --> 01:11:35,080
this whole thing is a ruse,

1414
01:11:35,183 --> 01:11:37,631
<i>and Genevieve's idol is real.</i>

1415
01:11:37,735 --> 01:11:39,873
But I'm protected tonight. I have my idol.

1416
01:11:39,976 --> 01:11:43,769
<i>So myself, Rachel and
teeny will make the decision.</i>

1417
01:11:43,873 --> 01:11:46,217
Genevieve or Sam go home tonight.

1418
01:11:47,286 --> 01:11:48,700
<i>Rachel and sue didn't buy it.</i>

1419
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:51,252
It's hard for any of us to feel confident

1420
01:11:51,355 --> 01:11:53,011
in making the call that we're gonna

1421
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:54,769
put all of our votes on Genevieve.

1422
01:11:54,873 --> 01:11:56,769
<i>The only thing I can think of to do to get</i>

1423
01:11:56,873 --> 01:11:59,424
<i>to the bottom of it is approach Genevieve</i>

1424
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:02,735
with all the information I
have and give her the chance

1425
01:12:02,838 --> 01:12:06,562
to tell me if the idol is real or if it's fake.

1426
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:09,597
- I feel very confused.
- Okay.

1427
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,217
I feel like I've, like,

1428
01:12:11,321 --> 01:12:13,597
really been duped in this game,

1429
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,286
and how wrong my gut
was in so many ways.

1430
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:20,424
- Okay.
- Sam told me the idol is fake,

1431
01:12:20,528 --> 01:12:22,838
and it was in a pitch to take you out.

1432
01:12:22,942 --> 01:12:24,769
Okay.

1433
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:28,424
And I wanted to bring it to you
to hear what you have to say.

1434
01:12:32,011 --> 01:12:34,735
It is fake and I am a sitting duck.

1435
01:12:34,838 --> 01:12:36,562
Dang it.

1436
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:38,286
I really trusted him.

1437
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:41,183
<i>I'm incredibly bummed that teeny knows</i>

1438
01:12:41,286 --> 01:12:44,700
<i>that my idol is fake,</i>
but perception is reality.

1439
01:12:44,804 --> 01:12:46,148
<i>And so, if sue and Rachel</i>

1440
01:12:46,252 --> 01:12:48,597
<i>do genuinely believe I have an idol</i>

1441
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,942
and they believe I'll play it for myself,

1442
01:12:51,045 --> 01:12:53,217
which means they will put votes on Sam.

1443
01:12:53,321 --> 01:12:58,286
<i>I have to write down Sam,
and he'll write down me.</i>

1444
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,907
Or if you want Sam gone,

1445
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:02,942
you can tell them you don't believe him,

1446
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,976
and then we pile on Sam.

1447
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,597
<i>- Genevieve confirms it.
- I've got her.</i>

1448
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:08,883
I'm gonna be able to take her out tonight

1449
01:13:08,907 --> 01:13:10,056
if that's what I choose to do.

1450
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,252
<i>What's going on, teeny?</i>

1451
01:13:11,355 --> 01:13:13,045
<i>But there is a possibility</i>

1452
01:13:13,148 --> 01:13:14,976
<i>she could have another
trick up her sleeve,</i>

1453
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,400
<i>and they've worked out this, too,</i>

1454
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:17,873
and it's actually a real idol.

1455
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,456
- It's...
- She was calculating out.

1456
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,228
- There has to be something else.
- She's gonna put one on me.

1457
01:13:21,252 --> 01:13:23,607
- They want to split our votes.
- Like, you think it's a real idol?

1458
01:13:23,631 --> 01:13:25,321
I think it's a real idol.

1459
01:13:25,424 --> 01:13:27,262
So what do you guys
want to do... vote for him?

1460
01:13:27,286 --> 01:13:29,735
Do we just load on Sam?

1461
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,080
I'd like to load on her,

1462
01:13:31,183 --> 01:13:32,873
and she's either got it or she doesn't.

1463
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:34,424
My god. I just have no idea

1464
01:13:34,528 --> 01:13:35,849
- what we should do.
- I don't, either.

1465
01:13:35,873 --> 01:13:38,597
<i>I believe Genevieve's</i> idol is fake.

1466
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,735
<i>She's been playing us all along.</i>

1467
01:13:41,838 --> 01:13:43,286
<i>She's conniving.</i>

1468
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:45,459
<i>She's actually brilliant,
and she's gonna do</i>

1469
01:13:45,562 --> 01:13:48,045
everything under the sun to win this.

1470
01:13:49,286 --> 01:13:50,562
<i>Something's going on.</i>

1471
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:52,252
<i>They are bluffing us.</i>

1472
01:13:52,355 --> 01:13:55,217
<i>The fact that Sam is
pushing this makes me think</i>

1473
01:13:55,321 --> 01:13:56,562
the idol's actually real.

1474
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:01,217
<i>And so, it would be a
gamble to vote Genevieve.</i>

1475
01:14:02,286 --> 01:14:05,735
<i>We've been duped so
many times</i> by these people

1476
01:14:05,838 --> 01:14:08,045
<i>that I don't know whether
we vote Sam or Genevieve.</i>

1477
01:14:08,148 --> 01:14:11,838
<i>My brain</i> is like scrambled
eggs at this point.

1478
01:14:11,942 --> 01:14:14,321
<i>And that's not necessarily
the best state of mind to be in</i>

1479
01:14:14,424 --> 01:14:17,148
<i>when making a decision
that's as important</i>

1480
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:19,080
as the final five boot on <i>survivor.</i>

1481
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:46,321
Now bring in the members of our jury.

1482
01:15:07,286 --> 01:15:09,873
All right, let's start with the challenge.

1483
01:15:09,976 --> 01:15:12,873
We had another showdown
between Rachel and Genevieve.

1484
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:14,735
Rachel, you pulled it out

1485
01:15:14,838 --> 01:15:17,080
for your third individual immunity win,

1486
01:15:17,183 --> 01:15:19,700
which means you cannot
be voted out of this game.

1487
01:15:19,804 --> 01:15:22,183
You are safe tonight. You
have made it to the final four.

1488
01:15:22,286 --> 01:15:24,976
At the very least, you'll
be back here making fire.

1489
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,252
So, congratulations.

1490
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,286
Thank you. It feels amazing.

1491
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:30,907
- It should.
- Yeah.

1492
01:15:31,011 --> 01:15:34,114
I mean, today, I knew that if I did not win,

1493
01:15:34,217 --> 01:15:36,631
I would be out of this game tonight.

1494
01:15:36,735 --> 01:15:39,528
Genevieve, you had many
chances yourself to win it,

1495
01:15:39,631 --> 01:15:41,080
but close doesn't matter.

1496
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:43,159
You don't have the necklace.
You're vulnerable tonight.

1497
01:15:43,183 --> 01:15:45,114
That I am.

1498
01:15:45,217 --> 01:15:48,735
And I was trying so hard
to beat Rachel because

1499
01:15:48,838 --> 01:15:50,942
I view her as such a threat in this game,

1500
01:15:51,045 --> 01:15:53,666
and my, like, heart was
crushed when she won.

1501
01:15:53,769 --> 01:15:55,873
And so, back to the drawing board,

1502
01:15:55,976 --> 01:15:58,631
because Rachel cannot
be voted out tonight.

1503
01:15:58,735 --> 01:16:01,148
Teeny, the last couple of tribal councils

1504
01:16:01,252 --> 01:16:03,114
have been bananas.

1505
01:16:03,217 --> 01:16:06,735
Shocking blindsides,
blocked vote, idol plays.

1506
01:16:06,838 --> 01:16:09,045
And this is the last vote.

1507
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:11,286
So, what was it like this afternoon?

1508
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:13,769
I'd actually like to take it back.

1509
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:16,666
Last tribal, we were
all evidently surprised,

1510
01:16:16,769 --> 01:16:19,114
besides sue, by Rachel's idol play,

1511
01:16:19,217 --> 01:16:21,217
because before that, the belief

1512
01:16:21,321 --> 01:16:22,838
that I was under was that Genevieve

1513
01:16:22,942 --> 01:16:25,183
was the only person in
the game who had an idol.

1514
01:16:25,286 --> 01:16:28,114
And I gained a whole new perspective

1515
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:29,666
on this game, and learned

1516
01:16:29,769 --> 01:16:32,286
some information from Sam

1517
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:35,838
that Genevieve's idol is not real.

1518
01:16:35,942 --> 01:16:39,114
So, I think there is so much
uncertainty, and the fact

1519
01:16:39,217 --> 01:16:41,873
that I ever believed the idol
was real makes me question

1520
01:16:41,976 --> 01:16:44,011
if I should even believe it's not.

1521
01:16:46,011 --> 01:16:48,562
Wow. So, Rachel, this is what happens

1522
01:16:48,666 --> 01:16:52,045
when you get this deep into
<i>survivor,</i> and there have been

1523
01:16:52,148 --> 01:16:55,252
a lot of truths and untruths spread.

1524
01:16:55,355 --> 01:16:57,528
You no longer know which is which.

1525
01:16:57,631 --> 01:16:59,700
Yeah. Today, we were

1526
01:16:59,804 --> 01:17:02,217
spinning with conspiracy theories.

1527
01:17:02,321 --> 01:17:04,631
Like, "Genevieve has an idol."

1528
01:17:04,735 --> 01:17:06,286
"Is the idol real?"

1529
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:08,424
"Are Genevieve and
Sam working together

1530
01:17:08,528 --> 01:17:11,597
"to try and get the three of our votes

1531
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,148
"on to the wrong person

1532
01:17:13,252 --> 01:17:15,252
"so that they control what happens

1533
01:17:15,355 --> 01:17:17,114
if the idol is real?"

1534
01:17:17,217 --> 01:17:19,390
And trying to get to the bottom of

1535
01:17:19,493 --> 01:17:23,700
what the truth is was
the topic of the afternoon.

1536
01:17:23,804 --> 01:17:26,493
Sam, one of the
interesting parts of this is

1537
01:17:26,597 --> 01:17:29,735
teeny says, "I got all
this information from Sam.

1538
01:17:29,838 --> 01:17:31,873
I mean, I think I got information."

1539
01:17:31,976 --> 01:17:33,355
Yeah. I felt

1540
01:17:33,459 --> 01:17:35,597
it was in the best interest of my game

1541
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,942
to let that information get out there.

1542
01:17:38,045 --> 01:17:39,700
And as I've learned in this game,

1543
01:17:39,804 --> 01:17:41,390
if you want information out there,

1544
01:17:41,493 --> 01:17:43,355
tell teeny. It'll get out there.

1545
01:17:45,011 --> 01:17:46,183
- Wow.
- That's a reputation

1546
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,459
I think I've had for a majority of my life,

1547
01:17:48,562 --> 01:17:51,286
and I don't think any of my
friends would be surprised

1548
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:52,790
to hear it, but that's also the way

1549
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:54,769
that I've chosen to play this game.

1550
01:17:54,873 --> 01:17:56,538
And it's gotten me a seat in the final five.

1551
01:17:56,562 --> 01:17:59,735
All I can do is trust my gut tonight.

1552
01:17:59,838 --> 01:18:02,907
And right now, I've
never felt more confident

1553
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,700
that I'm less confident in
what's going to happen.

1554
01:18:05,804 --> 01:18:08,390
But I'm also sure that what I do tonight

1555
01:18:08,493 --> 01:18:11,321
will either lose me the
game or possibly win it for me.

1556
01:18:11,424 --> 01:18:13,217
So you're certain

1557
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:14,873
that you're completely uncertain?

1558
01:18:14,976 --> 01:18:16,355
Absolutely.

1559
01:18:16,459 --> 01:18:17,735
And you are certain that

1560
01:18:17,838 --> 01:18:19,597
it will either be good or bad?

1561
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,045
You got it.

1562
01:18:21,148 --> 01:18:23,942
Genevieve just spun me
around in circles today,

1563
01:18:24,045 --> 01:18:26,321
like she has many times in this game

1564
01:18:26,424 --> 01:18:29,148
and I'm sick of it and I just want

1565
01:18:29,252 --> 01:18:32,286
to survive it one last time,
and that's where I'm at.

1566
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:34,355
So vote for her.

1567
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:36,838
I gave the blueprint. I said,
"Genevieve's idol is fake.

1568
01:18:36,942 --> 01:18:39,321
We can all vote for Genevieve."

1569
01:18:39,424 --> 01:18:41,183
And they don't want to believe it.

1570
01:18:41,286 --> 01:18:42,557
I don't-i don't really
know what the problem is.

1571
01:18:42,581 --> 01:18:42,814
Sam, me

1572
01:18:42,838 --> 01:18:44,331
and you haven't talked. I
didn't say I wasn't voting for her.

1573
01:18:44,355 --> 01:18:45,597
I'm just... well,

1574
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,500
I'm just saying, if
everybody's got a problem

1575
01:18:47,562 --> 01:18:49,331
with how Genevieve's playing
the game, vote for Genevieve.

1576
01:18:49,355 --> 01:18:51,115
And that's what I've
been told is happening.

1577
01:18:51,217 --> 01:18:52,711
- Everyone's voting for me.
- But it's also hard to trust Sam

1578
01:18:52,735 --> 01:18:54,538
because Sam and Genevieve
work together, and, you know,

1579
01:18:54,562 --> 01:18:57,390
- come up with crazy plans, so...
- I mean, if her idol

1580
01:18:57,493 --> 01:19:00,597
is real, and their two votes
vote out whoever they want,

1581
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,607
- because we all piled our votes on her.
- Get the picture?

1582
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:04,562
Yeah. It's <i>survivor.</i>

1583
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:08,286
I am sorry people
don't appreciate the spin

1584
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:10,252
and they don't appreciate the stories, but

1585
01:19:10,355 --> 01:19:12,493
what am I supposed to do? Just go,

1586
01:19:12,597 --> 01:19:14,390
"okay, game over. You got me"?

1587
01:19:14,493 --> 01:19:15,804
I don't blame you for doing it.

1588
01:19:15,907 --> 01:19:17,804
It's not a lack of appreciation, Genevieve.

1589
01:19:17,907 --> 01:19:21,252
It's that I also want
to survive in this game.

1590
01:19:21,355 --> 01:19:23,217
And that's my response to it,

1591
01:19:23,321 --> 01:19:26,011
is feeling spun around, but trying to...

1592
01:19:26,114 --> 01:19:28,286
Advocate for myself and
make the best move for me.

1593
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:29,804
It's not a lack of appreciation.

1594
01:19:29,907 --> 01:19:31,666
- Don't take offense.
- Okay.

1595
01:19:31,769 --> 01:19:34,321
Sam, from the standpoint of

1596
01:19:34,424 --> 01:19:38,045
the five of you looking to
win this season of <i>survivor,</i>

1597
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,321
is tonight's vote the
biggest vote of the season?

1598
01:19:40,424 --> 01:19:42,011
I think they all get bigger.

1599
01:19:42,114 --> 01:19:44,735
The final three is not
really, like, a future plan.

1600
01:19:44,838 --> 01:19:47,942
It's, like, reality because you're forming it.

1601
01:19:48,045 --> 01:19:52,045
So, yes, each one's bigger than the last.

1602
01:19:52,148 --> 01:19:54,183
- Concerning?
- No.

1603
01:19:54,286 --> 01:19:56,493
I'm voting for Genevieve.
Everybody knows.

1604
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:02,355
And, sue, you seem very confident.

1605
01:20:02,459 --> 01:20:04,262
You're not concerned about
this conversation, either.

1606
01:20:04,286 --> 01:20:05,942
I... they know where I'm going.

1607
01:20:06,045 --> 01:20:08,459
And I, so far, have
always stuck to my word.

1608
01:20:10,735 --> 01:20:12,011
Are we ready to vote?

1609
01:20:12,114 --> 01:20:13,435
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready. - I'm ready.

1610
01:20:13,459 --> 01:20:15,390
Are you ready, teeny?

1611
01:20:15,493 --> 01:20:16,873
Couldn't be more ready.

1612
01:20:16,976 --> 01:20:18,496
I don't know what else I need to hear.

1613
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:27,355
All right, it is time to
vote. Rachel, you're up.

1614
01:21:29,045 --> 01:21:31,080
I'll go tally the votes.

1615
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:57,045
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,

1616
01:21:57,148 --> 01:21:59,976
tonight is the last night you can do so.

1617
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:10,769
I told you it was fake.

1618
01:22:11,735 --> 01:22:12,769
Aw.

1619
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,045
- All right, I'll read the votes.
- Jeff?

1620
01:22:18,148 --> 01:22:19,735
I'd like to say something.

1621
01:22:19,838 --> 01:22:22,252
I found this immunity idol

1622
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:24,976
that I would like to
play tonight for myself.

1623
01:22:31,528 --> 01:22:33,528
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1624
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,666
This is a hidden immunity idol.

1625
01:22:43,769 --> 01:22:46,528
Any votes cast for sue will not count.

1626
01:22:49,217 --> 01:22:50,873
I'll read the votes.

1627
01:22:53,217 --> 01:22:54,355
First vote:

1628
01:22:54,459 --> 01:22:55,838
Genevieve.

1629
01:22:59,286 --> 01:23:01,804
Sam. That's one vote
Genevieve, one vote Sam.

1630
01:23:06,321 --> 01:23:09,355
Sam. That's two votes
Sam, one vote Genevieve.

1631
01:23:16,045 --> 01:23:17,735
Genevieve.

1632
01:23:17,838 --> 01:23:19,942
We're tied. Two votes Genevieve,

1633
01:23:20,045 --> 01:23:22,252
two votes Sam, one vote left.

1634
01:23:26,217 --> 01:23:27,838
Fourteenth person voted out

1635
01:23:27,942 --> 01:23:29,735
and the seventh member of our jury:

1636
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,631
Genevieve.

1637
01:23:31,735 --> 01:23:33,321
Need to bring me your torch.

1638
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:35,528
Good playing, Genevieve.

1639
01:23:35,631 --> 01:23:37,321
- Good game, Genevieve.
- Hugs.

1640
01:23:40,355 --> 01:23:42,390
Come on, give me one.

1641
01:23:47,217 --> 01:23:49,217
Sorry for all the spinning.

1642
01:23:59,597 --> 01:24:01,700
Nice.

1643
01:24:15,321 --> 01:24:17,321
Genevieve, the tribe has spoken.

1644
01:24:17,424 --> 01:24:19,321
They have.

1645
01:24:19,424 --> 01:24:20,838
Thank you for the opportunity.

1646
01:24:20,942 --> 01:24:23,062
- I had the time of my life.
- Thanks for being here.

1647
01:24:23,148 --> 01:24:24,607
- Time for you to go.
- Bye, Genevieve.

1648
01:24:24,631 --> 01:24:25,976
- Good luck.
- Bye, Genevieve.

1649
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:40,148
Congratulations on surviving
another stage of this game.

1650
01:24:40,252 --> 01:24:42,838
You can no longer be voted out.

1651
01:24:42,942 --> 01:24:45,873
Tomorrow you'll compete in
your final immunity challenge.

1652
01:24:45,976 --> 01:24:48,769
The winner earns a
spot in the final three.

1653
01:24:48,873 --> 01:24:51,493
For the other three, at the very least,

1654
01:24:51,597 --> 01:24:53,700
you'll be making fire, which means,

1655
01:24:53,804 --> 01:24:57,183
teeny, Rachel, sue, Sam,

1656
01:24:57,286 --> 01:24:59,631
any one of you could win this game.

1657
01:24:59,735 --> 01:25:02,355
Grab your torches. Head
back to camp. Good night.

1658
01:25:03,493 --> 01:25:05,011
Thank you.
