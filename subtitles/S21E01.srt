1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,258
>> Jeff: THIS IS NICARAGUA:

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:14,097
REMOTE, MYSTERIOUS, DANGEROUS.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,599
STRADDLED BETWEEN
THE RAGING WATERS

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,103
OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN
AND THE CARIBBEAN SEA.

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,273
IT'S WHERE ANCIENT RAIN FORESTS
BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,650
AGAINST SOME OF THE WORLD'S
YOUNGEST

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,610
AND MOST ACTIVE VOLCANOS.

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,113
THIS RUGGED LAND
HAS RESISTED TAMING

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,282
SINCE THE DAYS
OF THE CONQUISTADORS.

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,325
AND IT IS WHERE 20 AMERICANS
HAVE ALREADY BEGUN

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,328
THE ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME.

12
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,874
>> EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK THERE'S
MONKEYS HANGING FROM THINGS.

13
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,292
THERE'S DANGEROUS ANIMALS HERE.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,293
IT'S LIKE...

15
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,294
IT'S REAL.

16
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,255
THERE'S NO FENCES LIKE THE ZOO.

17
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,469
>> I'M JIMMY JOHNSON.

18
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,344
I'M 66 YEARS OLD AND I'VE WON

19
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,180
TWO COLLEGIATE
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS.

20
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,682
I'VE WON TWO SUPERBOWLS.

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,852
WHAT COULD TOP IT OFF BETTER
THAN TO WIN "SURVIVOR"?

22
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,270
>> Jeff: THEY THINK THEY'VE
ALREADY

23
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,689
BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWO TRIBES.

24
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,149
THOUGH THEY HAVE NOT SPOKEN,

25
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,486
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
ARE ALREADY FORMING.

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,863
>> I NOTICE THE OLDER GENTLEMAN
LOOKS LIKE A MAFIA BOSS

27
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,156
AND HE LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO
BOSS PEOPLE AROUND

28
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,283
AND I'M NOT THE KIND
OF CHARACTER

29
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,619
THAT LIKES HIS BUTTONS PUSHED.

30
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,537
>> THERE'S AN OLD
GRAY-HAIRED GUY

31
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,623
THAT'S PISSING ME OFF ALREADY.

32
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,166
HE SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY
WHO'S GOING TO STEP

33
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,626
INTO THE LEADERSHIP POSITION.

34
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,587
I HOPE HE DOES BECAUSE HE'LL
JUST GET KICKED OFF RIGHT AWAY.

35
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,922
>> JEFF: FORCED
TO WORK TOGETHER,

36
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,840
THEY MUST LEARN TO ADAPT
OR THEY'LL BE VOTED OUT.

37
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,841
>> I'M SINGLE.

38
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,383
(\LAUGHS\)
I AM SINGLE, SINGLE, SINGLE.

39
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,177
VERY SINGLE.

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,806
AND FLIRTING IS SOMETHING
I'M GOING TO USE IF I HAVE TO.

41
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,307
>> JEFF: IN THE END, ONLY ONE

42
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,143
WILL REMAIN TO CLAIM
THE MILLION-DOLLAR PRIZE.

43
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,235
39 DAYS, 20 PEOPLE,
ONE SURVIVOR!

44
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,492
(\THEME SONG PLAYING\)

45
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,473
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

46
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,909
WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR:
NICARAGUA."

47
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,078
WOMAN IN THE PLAID,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

48
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,455
>> EVE.

49
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,497
>> JEFF: YOU'VE HAD
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME

50
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,291
TO SPEND WITH THESE PEOPLE.

51
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,669
CAN YOU TELL THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE
FROM THE WAY THEY WALK?

52
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,462
FROM THE WAY THEY'RE LOOKING AT
EACH OTHER?

53
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,631
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

54
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,466
YOU CAN TELL A LOT
ABOUT A PERSON

55
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,301
NOT JUST THE WAY THEY'RE WALKING

56
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,094
BUT BY THE WAY THEY'RE WATCHING
OTHER PEOPLE.

57
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,514
>> I WAS BORN WITH
A BIRTH DEFECT THAT FORCED

58
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,309
THE AMPUTATION OF MY RIGHT LEG
WHEN I WAS SIX MONTHS OLD.

59
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,771
I THINK INITIALLY I'M KEEPING
EVERYTHING A SECRET.

60
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,481
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO MAKE
ASSUMPTIONS

61
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,776
ABOUT MY PHYSICAL ABILITY
AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO.

62
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,110
>> Jeff: GUY IN THE BLUE,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

63
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,946
>> MARTY.

64
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,115
>> Jeff: THINK YOU'VE PICKED UP
ANYTHING BASED ON EYE CONTACT?

65
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,992
>> YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE ARE

66
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,702
"THIS IS MY TEAM, THIS IS WHO
I'M GOING TO BE WITH."

67
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,038
SO PEOPLE ARE CHECKING
EACH OTHER OUT.

68
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,290
AS I'M LOOKING AROUND THE GROUP
RIGHT NOW,

69
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,334
I SEE JIMMY JOHNSON,
AN N.F.L. COACH.

70
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,462
I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH
JIMMY JOHNSON IN THIS GAME.

71
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,674
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE HELL
HE'S EVEN HERE.

72
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,843
AND I'D RATHER HAVE HIM
ON THE OTHER TRIBE, FRANKLY.

73
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,179
>> Jeff: YOU GUYS READY
TO GET STARTED?

74
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,514
>> YES!

75
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,015
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

76
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,186
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DOWN THAT
LAGOON

77
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,355
IS A MEDALLION OF POWER.

78
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,857
THE MEDALLION OF POWER

79
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,069
COULD GIVE YOU HUGE ADVANTAGE
IN THIS GAME.

80
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,531
THE PERSON WHO RETURNS WEARING
THE MEDALLION OF POWER

81
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,992
CLAIMS IT FOR THEIR TRIBE.

82
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,410
THIS IS NOT
AN INDIVIDUAL REWARD.

83
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,536
MAKE SENSE?

84
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,788
>> YES!

85
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,540
>> Jeff: YOU CAN GO
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

86
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,219
>> SOMEBODY'S GOT TO THE RUN
TO THE RIGHT;

87
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,721
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO RUN
TO THE LEFT.

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,060
>> Jeff: PEOPLE ARE
SCATTERED EVERYWHERE

89
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,979
LOOKING FOR THE MEDALLION
OF POWER.

90
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,022
>> KEEP LOOKING!

91
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,356
KEEP LOOKING.

92
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,115
>> OH, MY GOD!

93
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,592
>> VERY GOOD!

94
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,094
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY HEAD ON BACK.

95
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,262
>> ONE OF OURS.

96
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:46,804
>> YES, SIR.

97
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,390
>> WHAT A WAY TO START.

98
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,641
I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME
BUT YOU DID A GREAT JOB!

99
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,936
>> Jeff: GUYS, COME ON BACK IN.

100
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,605
>> I NOTICED THERE WAS A GIRL
WITH A LIMP.

101
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,815
SHE HAS DARKER BROWN HAIR

102
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,443
AND I COULDN'T TELL
WHAT WAS UP WITH IT.

103
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,612
LIKE, I THINK THAT SHE, LIKE,
MAYBE HAS, LIKE, A HIP PROBLEM?

104
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,281
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

105
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,783
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THAT.

106
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,576
>> Jeff: MARTY, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE

107
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,078
ON BRENDA HAVING
THE MEDALLION OF POWER?

108
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,621
>> I THINK IT'S A KILLER.

109
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,624
IT'S IMPORTANT TO WIN ANYTHING
THROWN AT US AND TO BE THE TRIBE

110
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,628
TO WIN THE FIRST THING, I THINK
BODES REALLY WELL FOR US.

111
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,298
>> Jeff: IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF IT WERE THAT WAY.

112
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,009
UNFORTUNATELY, MARTY,
THIS IS NOT THE WAY

113
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,886
THE TRIBES ARE GOING
TO BE DIVIDED.

114
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,974
WE'RE NOW GOING
TO DIVIDE INTO TRIBES.

115
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,644
IF YOU ARE 40 AND OLDER
YOU'RE OVER HERE.

116
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,605
(\LAUGHTER\)

117
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,148
>> HEY!

118
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,193
HEY!

119
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,529
>> Jeff: IF YOU ARE 30
AND YOUNGER, YOU'RE OVER HERE.

120
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,157
>> DAMN, MAN, I WANTED THE OLD
FOOTBALL COACH, MAN!

121
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,450
>> OH, GOD!

122
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,618
>> JIMMY JOHNSON!

123
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,702
>> Jeff: DIVIDE IT UP!

124
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,454
LET'S GO.

125
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,039
>> YOUNG GUNS!

126
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:55,706
>> I'M YOUNG AT HEART!

127
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,167
OH, MAN!

128
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,585
THE OLDER ONES HERE,
THE YOUNGER ONES THERE.

129
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,005
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME OF
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE CARRYING ME.

130
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,298
(\LAUGHS\)

131
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,009
I DON'T WANT ANY
OF THE OLD PEOPLE WITH ME.

132
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,930
>> WHEN THE SWITCH CAME,
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS OH, DAMN.

133
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,975
THE ANTIQUES HAVE THE BEST COACH
YOU COULD ASK FOR.

134
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,685
THEY'VE GOT A SUPER BOWL WINNING
COACH ON THEIR TEAM.

135
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,228
HE'S A GREAT LEADER.

136
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,022
THAT'S WHAT HE'S DONE
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

137
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,358
>> Jeff: OLDER TRIBE,
YOU ARE ESPADA.

138
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,527
YOU'RE WEARING BLUE.

139
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,864
YOUNGER TRIBE, YOU'RE CALLED
LA FLOR, YOU'RE WEARING YELLOW.

140
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,366
PUT YOUR BUFFS ON.

141
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,868
MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

142
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,869
>> WHERE DO YOU PUT IT?

143
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,078
>> I THINK IT CAN GO
ON YOUR HEAD.

144
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,121
>> I'LL HAVE TO MESS UP MY HAIR.

145
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,873
IT'S GOING TO BE MESSED UP
FOR A WHILE ANYWAY.

146
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,083
>> Jeff: BRENDA, YOU WON

147
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,335
THE MEDALLION OF POWER
FOR YOUR TRIBE.

148
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,337
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH POWER
IT HAS,

149
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,340
ALL YOU KNOW IS THAT IT
IS FOR YOUR TRIBE.

150
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,217
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO MAKE A DECISION.

151
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,761
YOU CAN HOLD ON
TO THIS UNKNOWN POWER

152
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,389
AND GET A CHANCE TO USE IT
LATER IN THE GAME

153
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,726
OR YOU CAN TRADE IT RIGHT NOW
FOR FIRE

154
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,937
IN THE FORM OF FLINT

155
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,983
AND A CRATE
FULL OF FISHING GEAR.

156
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,570
YOU'VE GOT MASK, FINS, LINE,

157
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,032
HOOKS AND A SPEAR
TO GO ALONG WITH IT.

158
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,243
SO AS A TRIBE
HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE DECIDING.

159
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,746
DO YOU KEEP POWER IN THE GAME

160
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,916
OR DO YOU GIVE IT UP
FOR A QUICK START BACK AT CAMP?

161
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,127
WHAT YOU DON'T KEEP
THE OTHER TRIBE GETS.

162
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,420
>> YEAH.

163
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,504
>> OKAY.

164
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,756
>> I SAY WE KEEP IT BECAUSE THE
LONGER WE STAY IN

165
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,841
THE MORE OPPORTUNITIES
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.

166
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,426
>> KEEP IT.

167
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,761
>> THE MEDALLION THREW
EVERYTHING FOR A LOOP.

168
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,554
I WANT TO KEEP IT.

169
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,348
I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S POWER.

170
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,974
POWER.

171
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,309
>> I HOPE THEY KEEP IT.

172
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,435
>> I DO, TOO.

173
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,395
>> FIRE AND FISH.

174
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,731
FIRE'S GOING TO BE
SO IMPORTANT EARLY.

175
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,775
>> DECIDE, CHILDREN.

176
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,443
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S...

177
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:48,945
DUDE, WE'VE GOT TO FISH.

178
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,988
DO WE WANT FIRE OR FISH, DUDE?

179
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,281
>> Jeff: WHAT'S THE DECISION?

180
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,034
ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP POWER OR
TRADE IT FOR THE FISHING GEAR?

181
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,628
>> Jeff: SO HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE
DECIDING: DO YOU KEEP POWER

182
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:10,466
IN THE GAME OR ARE YOU GOING TO
TRADE IT FOR THE FISHING GEAR?

183
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,759
>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
THE FISHING GEAR.

184
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,969
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, BRENDA,
TAKE IT OFF

185
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,971
AND GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY
ON THE OTHER TRIBE.

186
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,848
OLDER TRIBE, YOU'LL GET A CHANCE
TO PLAY THAT MEDALLION OF POWER

187
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,017
AT SOME POINT LATER IN THE GAME.

188
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:20,851
>> WE GOT POWER,
WHATEVER IT MEANS.

189
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,852
(\LAUGHTER\)

190
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,853
>> WE'LL FIND OUT.

191
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,981
>> AND IT'S GOLD.

192
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,649
DON'T WINNERS CARRY GOLD?

193
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,819
>> Jeff: ESPADA, HEAD OUT THAT
WAY, LA FLOR, HEAD OUT THAT WAY.

194
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,362
>> I FIGURE THE OLD PEOPLE

195
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,197
NEED THE MEDALLION OF POWER
MORE THAN WE DO.

196
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,824
I DON'T WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE
THE OLD PEOPLE BUT I DON'T THINK

197
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,326
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE
SOME CHALLENGES.

198
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,870
THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD
LOSE TO THEM.

199
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,629
>> MARTY?

200
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,630
JIMMY.

201
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,631
>> JIMMY...

202
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,674
JIMMY?

203
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,174
>> JIMMY J.!

204
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,177
JUST CALL ME JIMMY.

205
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,805
OH, MAN!

206
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,183
ALL THE ADVENTURES I'VE HAD
IN THE PAST, I WAS IN CHARGE.

207
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,312
I CAN FIRE PLAYERS,
I COULD RECRUIT PLAYERS,

208
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,813
I COULD SIGN THEM.

209
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,481
OUT HERE I DON'T HAVE
THE CONTROL.

210
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,859
SO WE'VE GOT TO GET THE FLOOR
OF THE SHELTER.

211
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,361
MAYBE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE
INFATUATED WITH ME

212
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,864
BEING HEAD COACH JIMMY JOHNSON
SUPERBOWL WINNER.

213
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,698
WELL, I'LL PLAY ON THAT.

214
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,367
I'LL PLAY SUPERSTAR STATUS.

215
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,414
SOME OF THESE OTHER PLAYERS
MAY RESENT THAT.

216
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,665
MAYBE THEY'RE
PHILADELPHIA EAGLE FANS

217
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,542
OR WASHINGTON RED SKIN FANS.

218
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,835
>> THAT'S JIMMY JOHNSON.

219
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,711
>> THAT CAN'T BE.

220
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,713
JIMMY JOHNSON WAS THE COACH

221
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,964
OF THE MIAMI DOLPHINS
AND DALLAS COWBOYS.

222
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,675
>> THAT'S HIM.

223
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,886
>> SO I'VE GOT TO WORK ON EACH
PARTICULAR CONTESTANT

224
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,096
TO WIN THEM OVER
BECAUSE IF I DON'T

225
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,849
I'LL BE A TARGET AND THEY'LL
VOTE ME OUT EARLY.

226
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,269
>> I REALLY LIKE YOU.

227
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,854
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU

228
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,898
I GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THAT
AND I TRUST YOU.

229
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,691
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

230
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,984
I AGREE.

231
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,943
>> OKAY.

232
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,236
I'M WITH YOU ALL THE WAY.

233
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,366
>> BACK IN SOUTH DAKOTA COACHING
THE SWIM TEAM YOU HAVE TO DEAL

234
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,369
WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT
PERSONALITIES

235
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,246
AND YOU STILL HAVE TO HOLD YOUR
COMPOSURE AT THE SAME TIME.

236
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,957
SO I'M A VERY GOOD JUDGE
OF PEOPLE.

237
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,546
THE FIRST TIME I SAW WENDY
I TRUSTED HER,

238
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,467
AND MOST OF THE TIME
I DO READ PEOPLE VERY WELL.

239
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,595
YOU GOT MY WORD.

240
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,264
>> HOLLY SAID SHE WANTED TO BE
IN AN ALLIANCE WITH ME

241
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,766
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS AWESOME,

242
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,935
BUT I WASN'T EXPECTING IT
SO SOON.

243
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,770
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M NAIVE.

244
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,607
MY BROTHER CALLS ME SHELTERED
AND THAT'S KIND OF LIKE NAIVE.

245
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,108
I GOT THREE!

246
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,610
THIS IS MY THIRD!

247
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,154
BEING A GOAT RANCHER,
YOU'RE WITH A LOT OF GOATS,

248
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,823
YOU DON'T MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE.

249
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,743
MY STRATEGY FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THE GAME

250
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,122
IS TAKE BABY STEPS FIRST, NOT BE
THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OFF.

251
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,958
MY HUSBAND THINKS I'M GOING TO
BE THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OFF

252
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,960
BECAUSE HE THINKS I TALK A LOT.

253
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,504
SO I THINK I'M GOING TO BITE
MY TONGUE

254
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:57,049
AND HIDE MY TRUE SELF
FROM THE TRIBE MATES.

255
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,636
>> WENDY JO, WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

256
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,304
>> FROM MONTANA.

257
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,013
>> AND YOU LIKE HORSES?

258
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,975
>> I DO!

259
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,770
>> SHE'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

260
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,896
>> WE GOT FIRE NOW.

261
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,981
>> HUH?

262
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,024
>> WE'LL HAVE FIRE NOW.

263
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,025
>> OKAY.

264
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,652
OH, YEAH, YOU GOT THAT.

265
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,987
>> I CAN DO IT.

266
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,990
WHO'S GOT THE GLASSES?

267
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:26,036
THEY THINK I'M SOME MIDDLE AGED
HOUSEWIFE THAT TOOTLES AROUND

268
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,165
THE HOUSE ALL DAY LONG,
THEY ARE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE.

269
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,333
BECAUSE THAT'S DEFINITELY
NOT ME.

270
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,002
I NEED TO GET IT
REALLY CONCENTRATED

271
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,588
RIGHT ON THAT SMALL SPOT.

272
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:39,008
I'M 56 YEARS OLD
AND I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON

273
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,510
THAT STAYS BUSY
ALL THE TIME DOING THINGS.

274
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,012
I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN'T DO.

275
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,599
WHERE THERE'S SMOKE
THERE WILL BE FIRE.

276
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,351
WINNING THE MILLION DOLLARS
IS REAL IMPORTANT TO ME

277
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,354
BECAUSE IT WILL HELP ME
PAY OFF MY FARM,

278
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:57,526
AND THE FACT THAT I LOST MY
HUSBAND IN '09, IT MEANS I WOULD

279
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,196
NOT HAVE TO WORK
AS HARD AS I DO.

280
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,032
BUT HIS SPIRIT I KNOW
IS STILL WITH ME.

281
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,534
AND THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME GOING.

282
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,702
>> THERE YOU GO!

283
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,953
THERE YOU GO!

284
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,331
HERE YOU GO!

285
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,208
FIRE!

286
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,209
(\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\)

287
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,043
KEEP IT GOING, GUYS.

288
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,712
>> JANE, YOU ROCK!

289
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,880
>> IS THAT FRICTION OR GLASSES?

290
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,881
>> GLASSES, BABY.

291
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,882
>> GLASSES, HONEY.

292
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,051
>> KILLER.

293
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,888
THEY GAVE UP THE MEDALLION
AND WHAT DID THEY GET?

294
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,057
JANE STARTED THE FIRE LITERALLY
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR.

295
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,893
THE FACT THAT WE MADE FIRE
THAT QUICKLY,

296
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,895
IT REASSURED US ALL
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT?

297
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,063
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS THING.

298
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,272
ESPADA RULES!

299
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,151
WE'VE GOT JUST AS MUCH GOING
FOR US AS THE YOUNG GROUP DOES.

300
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,909
(\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\)

301
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,078
>> HIGH FIVES ALL AROUND.

302
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,079
BENRY.

303
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,080
>> BENRY?

304
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,706
>> NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS.

305
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,876
THIS GAME THAT'S OLD GUYS
VERSUS YOUNG GUYS,

306
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,087
WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO DOMINATE.

307
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,591
GREAT BEACH, GREAT WAVES,
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.

308
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,426
DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER
THAN THAT, RIGHT?

309
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,553
>> DO WE HAVE A MACHETE?

310
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,595
>> WE HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE.

311
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,806
>> WE CAN CATCH RAINWATER
AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF.

312
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,226
AS SOON AS WE SAW 30 AND UNDER
IT WAS LIKE THESE ARE MY PEOPLE!

313
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,270
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A LOT OF FUN.

314
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,896
>> YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'D BE GOOD
IN THE WATER.

315
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,648
OR NOT.

316
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,775
OOH!

317
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,402
OW!

318
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,987
(\LAUGHTER\)

319
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,241
>> DAMN, THAT WAS IN THERE!

320
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,411
>> THE GUY WITH THE LONG BLOND
HAIR, HE'S A DUMB BLOND.

321
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,079
I MEAN, I NEVER REALLY
CALLED A GUY

322
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,623
A DUMB BLOND BEFORE
BUT HE'S A DUMB BLOND.

323
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,712
>> OW!

324
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,257
OW!

325
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,133
DAMN!

326
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,302
OW!

327
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,470
>> BLOND-HEAD KID,
THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE FABIO.

328
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,306
DUDE, HE'S JUST RETARDED.

329
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,016
>> WE'VE GOT TO GET MORE BAMBOO.

330
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,100
>> YOU'RE FABIO, YOU GO GET IT.

331
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,477
>> ALL RIGHT.

332
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,146
THE NAME FABIO, MAN,
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE

333
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,024
I WAS BEING CALLED THAT
AT FIRST.

334
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,775
>> I'M GOING TO GO HELP FABIO.

335
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,027
>> DO THAT, HE NEEDS IT.

336
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,654
DUDE IS AN IDIOT, DAMN.

337
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,324
>> FABIO, LIKE, RIDES
A WHITE HORSE AND DOES

338
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,160
BUTTER COMMERCIALS
AND IS KIND OF A CHEESE BALL.

339
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,828
WHATEVER.

340
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:13,662
DUDE, I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY CALL ME.

341
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,664
I'M GONNA WIN
THE MILLION DOLLARS

342
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,124
SO I GUESS MY NICK NAME
IS FABIO.

343
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,461
TIMBER!

344
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,342
>> OKAY, LOOK, I FEEL
THAT ME AND YOU

345
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,676
WILL BE THE STRONGEST
IN CHALLENGES.

346
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,011
WITHOUT ME AND YOU
I THINK THEY'RE SCREWED.

347
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,512
>> YOU AND I ARE DEFINITELY
GOING TO BE THE STRONGEST

348
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,681
AS FAR AS JUST STRENGTH WISE.

349
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,183
WE MAY NOT BE THE BEST SWIMMERS
OR SOMETHING.

350
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,727
>> I WON'T BE THE BEST SWIMMER
BUT STRENGTH WISE

351
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,145
ANY KIND OF ATHLETIC
ABILITY WISE...

352
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,897
>> THAT'S A TARGET ON OUR BACK.

353
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,816
>> YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY SEE
ALPHA MALES BEING TARGETED.

354
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,486
THAT'S WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT ME AND
YOU STICKING DOWN TO NUMBER TWO.

355
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,155
ROB AND RUSSELL COULD HAVE RAN
IT LAST YEAR.

356
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,823
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU

357
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,325
BUT I DON'T WANT ANOTHER GIRL
TO WIN IT.

358
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,077
>> EXACTLY.

359
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,912
>> IT'S IMPORTANT WE DON'T LET
GIRLS TAKE OVER.

360
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,914
WE ALREADY GET OWNED
IN MARRIAGE.

361
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,582
PRETTY SOON WE'LL HAVE
A WOMAN PRESIDENT.

362
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,086
I MEAN, A GUY NEEDS TO SACK UP
AND WE NEED TO WIN THIS ONE.

363
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:10,552
>> SO BEING AN AMPUTEE, EVERY
TIME I NOTICE PEOPLE LOOKING

364
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,846
DOWN AT THE GROUND I THOUGHT
THEY WERE LOOKING AT MY LEG

365
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,765
AND MY FOOT
ABOUT WHAT ABOUT MY PANTS?

366
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,394
I WAS PARANOID THAT PEOPLE
WERE JUST STARING AT MY LEG.

367
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,396
I WAS DEFINITELY THINKING THEY

368
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,189
WERE SUSPECTING SOMETHING
WAS DIFFERENT.

369
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,401
SO I GUESS I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO JUST SHOW IT TO EVERYONE

370
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,862
AND SO THAT'S MY GOAL IS TO MAKE
SURE THAT I COME OUT WITH IT

371
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,740
AND AM ABLE TO PROVE IMMEDIATELY
THAT I AM

372
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,951
AS PHYSICALLY CAPABLE
AS EVERYONE ELSE.

373
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,370
>> I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING
TO EVERYONE.

374
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,413
>> WHAT'S UP?

375
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,414
>> CAN WE GROUP?

376
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,415
>> GROUP MEETING, GUYS.

377
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,457
>> WE GOT TREE MAIL?

378
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,127
>> NO, NO, I KIND OF CALLED
THE GROUP MEETING.

379
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,379
WE ALREADY HAVE
FIRST IMPRESSIONS,

380
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,256
GOTTEN TO KNOW EACH OTHER
SO I THINK AT THIS POINT

381
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,384
I'M PRETTY COMFORTABLE
WITH MY TEAM, RIGHT?

382
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,927
>> RIGHT.

383
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,929
>> WAIT, I'M CONFUSED.

384
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,723
>> WELL...

385
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,184
>> PROSTHETIC.

386
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,185
>> I KNEW IT!

387
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,562
>> I KNEW IT, TOO.

388
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,773
>> OH!

389
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,942
ALL RIGHT, NOW I AM EXCITED.

390
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,110
(\LAUGHS\)

391
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,445
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

392
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,113
>> I HAD A BIRTH DEFECT.

393
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,114
>> YOU ARE A ROCK STAR.

394
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,115
>> ALL RIGHT.

395
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,324
COOL.

396
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,618
>> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED
ON HOW THOSE THINGS WORK.

397
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,162
HOW DO YOU TELL IT TO MOVE?

398
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,246
(\LAUGHTER\)

399
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,914
>> SHE DOES HAVE A THIGH.

400
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,208
>> BEING THAT I'M SUCH A WUSS
I COULD ALMOST CRY.

401
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,086
IF I WENT TO THE FINAL THREE
WITH HER OR TWO

402
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,796
I'D BE LIKE JUST GIVE HER
THE MONEY.

403
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,632
JUST CUT HER THE CHECK BECAUSE
NO MONEY IN THE WORLD

404
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,594
CAN REPLACE WHAT SHE'S PROBABLY
GONE THROUGH IN HER LIFE.

405
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,847
BUT REALLY SHE'S GOING TO BE TOO
BIG OF A THREAT DOWN THE ROAD.

406
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,932
SYMPATHY VOTE NO DOUBT.

407
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,268
SO I FIGURE IF WE LOSE
A CHALLENGE TO THE OLD FOLKS,

408
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,605
SHE'S GOT TO BE ONE
OF THE FIRST ONES TO GO.

409
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,151
>> SO KELLY B. HAS ONE LEG

410
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,194
AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
GETTING MAD AT ME

411
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,655
BECAUSE I TALK ABOUT HER LEG
BUT IT'S A GAME.

412
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,200
FOR THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR
PLUS A MILLION.

413
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,452
SO I'M NOT GOING TO TREAT YOU
AS AN OUTCAST.

414
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,331
IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN
OUTRUN ME, GIRL, LET'S RACE.

415
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,507
>> GUYS, THE FIRE,
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.

416
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,383
>> THAT'S JUST...

417
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,471
(\APPLAUSE\)

418
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,932
(\RETCHING\)

419
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,902
>> I OVERDID IT, I THINK,
WHEN WE WERE GETTING

420
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:35,197
ALL THE WOOD AND GETTING
ALL THE BAMBOO,

421
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,534
AND EVERYBODY WAS SO EXCITED
TO GET HERE

422
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,244
AND START WORKING ON STUFF.

423
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,745
I JUST...

424
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,455
I THINK I DID MORE
THAN I NEEDED TO DO.

425
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,377
>> COACH NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL.

426
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,713
HE'S GETTING HIS ASS KICKED
OUT HERE NOW.

427
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,715
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING
FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD

428
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,759
OR IF HE'S GENUINELY ILL.

429
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,513
BUT THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEAK

430
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,807
AND HE'S NOT A YOUNG MAN.

431
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,278
>> ZERO SLEEP, SICK THROWING UP,

432
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,698
ANTS AND MOSQUITOS
BITING ME EVERYWHERE,

433
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,408
AND COLD AND SHIVERING
UNTIL THE SUN CAME UP.

434
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,786
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HAD
A 24-HOUR PERIOD

435
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,748
WHERE I WAS IN THAT MUCH
DISCOMFORT AND THAT MISERABLE.

436
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,835
I'VE WATCHED EVERY SECOND
OF "SURVIVOR."

437
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:34,339
I NEVER IMAGINED ANYWHERE CLOSE
THAT IT WAS THIS DIFFICULT.

438
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,301
FIRST TIME I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING LIKE THIS

439
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:42,055
AND IT'S AN EYE OPENER,
I PROMISE YOU.

440
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,105
>> DID YOU KNOW JIMMY JOHNSON?

441
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,315
>> I DIDN'T KNOW HIM
BEFORE THIS BUT...

442
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,399
>> OH, MY GOD.

443
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,442
>> DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HIM?

444
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,446
>> WELL, I USED TO CHEER
FOR THE DOLPHINS SO...

445
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,157
I LIKE YOUR SPIRIT.

446
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,616
>> I LIKE YOU, TOO.

447
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,450
>> OKAY, GOOD.

448
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,327
>> I ABSOLUTELY...

449
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,620
I THOUGHT THAT
FROM THE BEGINNING.

450
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,246
EVERYTHING'S JUST...

451
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,832
YOU CAN MAKE AN ALLIANCE
RIGHT NOW AND THEN YOU GET

452
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,501
IN A CHALLENGE AND END UP
HATING THAT PERSON.

453
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,420
>> I DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO HATE YOU.

454
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,589
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU
AND ME, JUST IN GENERAL.

455
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,007
BRENDA, SHE'S A CUTE GIRL.

456
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,634
I'M ATTRACTED TO HER.

457
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,551
I FOR SOME REASON
REALLY TRUST HER.

458
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,596
FIRST THOUGHT YOU COULD COME IN
AND DO...

459
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,641
GUYS WANT TO GET GIRLS OUT
OR SOMETHING. THAT'S CRAZY.

460
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,809
WHAT IF ONE OF THE GUYS IS WEAK
AND YOU DON'T WANT HIM AROUND?

461
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,019
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS THING

462
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,479
WHERE I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
ALLIANCES.

463
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,856
I'M NOT TRYING TO COME OUT HERE
AND LIE TO EVERYBODY

464
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,400
BUT MY DUMB ASS AND PUT MY NECK
ON THE LINE EARLY

465
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,029
AND I WAS NOT PLANNING
ON DOING THAT.

466
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,782
BUT I MADE THAT ALLIANCE
WITH SHANNON AND NOW I'VE GOT

467
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,160
TO FIGURE OUT
WHO I CAN REALLY TRUST.

468
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,412
>> SOMETIMES YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

469
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,372
>> I AGREE.

470
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,831
>> WE JUST KNOW.

471
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,500
I'M KIND OF USE TO HAVING GUYS
DO WHAT I SAY.

472
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,502
WHAT'S FUNNY IS CHASE CAME UP
AND TOLD ME THE GUYS HAVE

473
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,172
AN ALLIANCE GOING ON
AND OF COURSE I'M GOING TO USE

474
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:00,425
THAT INFORMATION
TO GET ME TO THE END.

475
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,053
I KNOW CHASE TRUSTS ME.

476
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:07,391
HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY
BUT HE'S CLUELESS.

477
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,393
THAT LOOKS LIKE A WELL.

478
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,104
YAY!

479
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,273
ALL RIGHT.

480
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,067
"THIS IS A CLUE TO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

481
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,485
IT IS UP TO YOU
WHETHER YOU SHARE

482
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,028
THIS INFORMATION
WITH ANYONE ELSE.

483
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,698
DECIPHER THE CLUES TO FIND
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL."

484
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,866
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

485
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,535
>> OH, GOSH, WELL, WE KEEP IT
BETWEEN US FOR SURE.

486
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,536
>> I THINK SO.

487
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,537
>> ESPECIALLY THIS EARLY.

488
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,373
THIS IS A MAP?

489
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,708
(\LAUGHS\)

490
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,501
I NEVER REALIZED
HOW HARD THESE ARE.

491
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,212
WE JUST FOUND THE CLUE
TO A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

492
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,839
THIS EARLY IN THE GAME.

493
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,174
BUT WE CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

494
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,926
>> SO WE'RE TRYING TO DECIPHER
WHAT THE CLUES MEAN.

495
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,052
>> THEY'RE NOT EASY.

496
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,554
>> WE'RE STUMPED.

497
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,889
SO WE'RE THINKING WE'RE JUST
GOING TO HOLD ON TO IT

498
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,143
AND MAYBE COME BACK TO IT.

499
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,563
>> WILL YOU REMEMBER
WHERE IT IS?

500
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,564
>> YEAH.

501
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,357
>> KELLY B. AND I...

502
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,443
IT'S KIND OF HARD RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE WE FOUND

503
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,528
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE
TOGETHER WHICH I WISH WE DIDN'T

504
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,740
FIND IT TOGETHER
SO NOW I'M KIND OF FORCED TO BE

505
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,742
IN AN ALLIANCE WITH HER AND I
DON'T WANT HER TO STICK AROUND

506
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,452
FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE...

507
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,746
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE END WITH HER BECAUSE,

508
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,165
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT
BUT SYMPATHY VOTE FOR SURE

509
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,251
AND I'M NOT TRYING
TO GO UP AGAINST THAT.

510
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,217
>> OKAY!

511
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:24,634
(\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\)

512
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,512
>> TREE-MAIL!

513
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,932
>> "CHANGE THE COURSE
OF WATERFALLS

514
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,560
OR YOU MAY JUST LOSE YOUR CLAIM.

515
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:38,607
KEEP YOUR MIND IN THE GUTTER OR
BE THE FIRST TO LEAVE THE GAME."

516
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,276
SO CAN WE GIVE OURSELVES ANY
ADVANTAGE WITH THAT?

517
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,779
>> THIS IS A VERY STRESSFUL TIME
ON THESE PEOPLE.

518
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,781
IT'S A VERY STRESSFUL TIME
ON ME.

519
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,741
WE'RE THE UNDERDOGS,

520
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,118
THE OLDER FOLKS
AND THEY NEED MOTIVATION.

521
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,620
EVERYBODY IN THIS WORLD
NEEDS MOTIVATION

522
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,955
AND I THINK I CAN HELP
MOTIVATE THIS TEAM.

523
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,917
OKAY, FOLKS, TEAM HUDDLE.

524
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,003
FIRST OF ALL,
THE REASON WHY I'M HERE

525
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,755
IS I'M HERE FOR THE ADVENTURE,

526
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,672
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
IN THE WORLD

527
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,342
A JURY'S GOING TO GIVE ME
A MILLION BUCKS.

528
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,510
I KNOW THAT.

529
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,637
BUT THE THING THAT I CAN DO,

530
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,473
I CAN HELP SOMEBODY WIN
A MILLION BUCKS.

531
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,643
AND THE WINNER CAN COME
FROM ONE OF YOU GUYS.

532
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,938
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER

533
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,773
THAN TO SEE ONE OF YOU
WIN A MILLION BUCKS.

534
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,441
AND I'LL HELP YOU ALL THE WAY.

535
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,484
I PROMISE YOU.

536
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,652
JUST AS LONG AS WE'RE
PSYCHED UP FOR IT

537
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,614
AND WE KNOW WHAT WE'VE GOT
TO DO, WE'LL KICK THEIR ASS.

538
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,449
ALL RIGHT?

539
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,408
>> ALL RIGHT!

540
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,369
>> I JUST GOT A PEP TALK
FROM JIMMY JOHNSON!

541
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,663
(\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\)

542
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,588
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

543
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,640
>> WHOO!

544
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,641
HA!

545
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,642
WHOO!

546
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,643
HA!

547
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,644
WHOO!

548
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,770
HA!

549
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,860
HALT!

550
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,070
LA FLOR!

551
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,323
>> Jeff: OKAY.

552
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,536
OLDER TRIBE.

553
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,246
THEY CAME IN SORT OF EITHER
SERENADING YOU

554
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,706
OR MAYBE THAT WAS A WAR CRY.

555
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,874
JIMMY?

556
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,875
ANY IMPACT?

557
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,210
>> I REALLY DON'T CONCENTRATE
ON WHAT THEY DO.

558
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,712
WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

559
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,340
>> Jeff: JUD, WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF THE OLDER TRIBE?

560
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,343
>> JEFF, HIS NAME IS FABIO,
NOT JUDSON.

561
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,387
HIS NAME IS FABIO.

562
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,555
HE'S THE MAN.

563
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,223
>> Jeff: LET'S FIGURE OUT.

564
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,559
KELLY, ARE YOU GOING TO GO BY
KELLY IN PURPLE AND BLOND HAIR?

565
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,018
WHAT ARE YOU GOING BY?

566
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,728
>> PURPLE KELLY.

567
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,104
>> Jeff: PURPLE KELLY.

568
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,189
ALL RIGHT.

569
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,275
TYRONE, WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY
ON THE OTHER TRIBE

570
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,028
LIKE KELLY WITH ONE
ARTIFICIAL LEG,

571
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:48,987
DOES THAT MAKE YOU THINK

572
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,739
"I'VE GOT TO TAKE IT
A LITTLE EASIER ON HER"?

573
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,073
>> NOT AT ALL.

574
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,033
THIS IS A COMPETITION,
WE'RE ALL OPERATING

575
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,743
BIG THE SAME RULES
AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN.

576
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,454
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

577
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,248
FOR TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
ONE PERSON WILL BE AT THE TOP

578
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,085
OF A TOWER POURING WATER
WHILE FIVE OTHER TRIBE MEMBERS

579
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,924
WILL USE SECTIONS OF GUTTER TO
DIRECT THAT WATER INTO A BARREL.

580
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:13,053
ONCE THE BARREL FILLS, A LARGE
BAG OF PUZZLE PIECES WILL DROP.

581
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,930
THE FOUR REMAINING TRIBE MEMBERS

582
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,640
MUST THEN USE THOSE PIECES
TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE.

583
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:21,895
FIRST TRIBE TO GET IT RIGHT
WINS IMMUNITY.

584
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,104
(\APPLAUSE\)

585
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,814
IF YOU HAVE IMMUNITY
IN YOUR POSSESSION,

586
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,942
YOU CAN NOT BE SENT HOME.

587
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,278
THE LOSERS OF THIS CHALLENGE
WILL GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

588
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,572
WHERE THE FIRST PERSON
WILL BE VOTED OUT.

589
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,074
ALL RIGHT.

590
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,492
NOW TO THE MEDALLION OF POWER.

591
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,494
OLDER TRIBE, YOU GUYS HAVE
THIS MEDALLION,

592
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,579
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF POWER IT POSSESSES.

593
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,748
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:
THE MEDALLION OF POWER

594
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:45,377
GIVES YOU HUGE ADVANTAGE
AT CHALLENGES.

595
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,634
IF YOU USE IT TODAY,
YOU WILL START THIS CHALLENGE

596
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,761
WITH ONE BUCKET OF WATER
ALREADY IN YOUR BARREL.

597
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,640
GIVEN THAT IT TAKES
ABOUT FIVE BUCKETS TO FILL,

598
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,434
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE.

599
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,979
IF YOU USE IT,
THEN THE MEDALLION GOES

600
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,981
TO THE YOUNGER TRIBE AND THEY
WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

601
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,691
TO USE IT AT THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

602
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,652
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

603
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,987
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENOUGH.

604
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,363
>> THIS TYPE OF A CHALLENGE

605
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,365
WE CAN COMPETE WITH THEM
NO PROBLEM.

606
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,658
>> LET'S MAKE A STATEMENT.

607
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,742
LET'S MAKE A STATEMENT
AND HOLD ON TO IT.

608
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,827
>> SO WE'RE KEEPING IT?

609
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,828
>> YEAH.

610
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,122
>> OKAY.

611
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,164
>> Jeff: OLDER TRIBE,
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?

612
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,332
YOU GOING TO USE IT OR NOT?

613
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,333
>> WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT.

614
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,668

GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

617
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,007
WE'LL GET STARTED.

618
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,635
OKAY.

619
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,803
IT IS THE FIRST
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

IS VERY SIMPLE:

628
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:58,783
ONE PERSON POURS WATER DOWN
THE GUTTERS INTO THE BARREL.

629
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:03,455
ONCE YOUR BARREL IS FULL,
THE PUZZLES WILL DROP.

630

00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,521
WHY ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY

692
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,190
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT NOW?

693
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,900
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

694
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,902
OLDER TRIBE, I'LL SEE YOU
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

695
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,030
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIRST
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

696
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,033
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD ON
BACK TO CAMP.

697
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,702
>> I REMEMBER MY SECOND
SUPERBOWL

698
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,370
WE LOST THE FIRST TWO
BALL GAMES.

699
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,039
BUT WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP GOING
AND WE HUNG IN THERE

700
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,875
AND, OF COURSE,
WON THE SUPER BOWL.

701
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,877
LOSING THE FIRST CHALLENGE,
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

702
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,545
JUST MAKE SURE WE MAKE
A SMART DECISION,

703
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,047
GET RID OF THE WEAKEST PLAYER

704
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,466
AND STILL HAVE THE MEDALLION,
STILL HAVE A STRONG TEAM.

705
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,026
>> LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

706
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,571
I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T EVEN THINK
CLEARLY RIGHT NOW.

707
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,617
I'M JUNKED FROM THE TRAUMA
OF THE CHALLENGE.

708
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,202
I NEED TO SLEEP.

709
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,037
I WANT TO LAY DOWN.

710
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,415
I'M 48 YEARS OLD, BUT THIS PLACE
ALREADY KNOCKED ME DOWN,

711
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,084
IT'S ONLY DAY THREE.

712
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,126
SO I'VE GOT TO LEARN TO DEAL
WITH THAT

713
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,047
AND I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.

714
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,924
>> JIMMY T.,
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

715
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,468
>> I THINK JIMMY'S TRYING
TO HORN SWAGGLE EVERYBODY,

716
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,221
TELLING EVERYBODY I REALLY CARE
ABOUT YOU,

717
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,097
I WANT TO MAKE YOU
A MILLION DOLLARS.

718
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,267
SO ANYWAY, I'M VOTING
JIMMY TONIGHT.

719
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,435
I'M JUST...

720
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,895
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

721
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,397
>> I'VE GOT TO SAY THIS.

722
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,940
I'M NOT GOING
TO NOT BE HEARD HERE.

723
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,275
>> OKAY.

724
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,359
>> I'M NOT GOING
TO NOT BE HEARD.

725
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,068
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I'M LISTENING, I'M LISTENING.

726
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,987
>> ALL RIGHT.

727
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,613
I KNOW...

728
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,115
I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES
STARS BLIND PEOPLE.

729
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,116
>> OKAY.

730
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,076
I'M TOTALLY WITH YOU.

731
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,161
>> I'VE GOT TO CALL HIM DOWN.

732
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,083
>> NOBODY WANTS TO BE
THE FIRST ONE TO GO HOME.

733
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,127
>> WHOEVER IT IS, YOU KNOW,

734
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,255
WE ALL GOT TO DECIDE TO TAKE OUT
THE WEAKEST PLAYER.

735
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,966
AND THAT MAKES THE TEAM
STRONGER.

736
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,802
>> SO WHO DO YOU THINK
IS THE WEAKEST PLAYER?

737
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:31,472
>> I THINK IT'S EITHER MYSELF
OR WENDY.

738
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,807
PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S WENDY.

739
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,435
I MEAN, HOW IS THIS TEAM
GOING TO GET STRONGER?

740
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,811
FORGET ABOUT PERSONALITIES.

741
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,146
FORGET ABOUT ALLIANCES.

742
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,231
>> YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?

743
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,190
>> I REALLY DO.

744
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,483
I MEAN IT.

745
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,152
>> COACH EXPLAINED THAT WE NEED

746
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,863
TO KEEP OUR TEAM STRONGER
AND I AGREE WITH HIM.

747
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,114
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT

748
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:52,118
BEFORE I RUSHED INTO
THE ALLIANCE WITH WENDY.

749
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,161
>> THIS GAME WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

750
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,078
>> I MEAN, BUT YOU ASK YOURSELF,

751
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,540
DOES THE TEAM GET STRONGER
WITHOUT WENDY?

752
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,500
>> I'M REALLY CAUGHT
IN A DILEMMA

753
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,295
BECAUSE I SHOOK HER HAND
AND GAVE HER MY WORD.

754
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,380
SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

755
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,882
I'M JUST GOING TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENS.

756
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,008
>> HERE'S THE QUESTION,
THOUGH...

757
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,636
>> AND THE POT'S NOT
GOING TO SET WELL.

758
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,554
>> I LOOK NERVOUS AND CONCERNED

759
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,139
PROBABLY BECAUSE I AM NERVOUS
AND CONCERNED.

760
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,850
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M
NERVOUS BUT I'M CONCERNED

761
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:19,646
BECAUSE I THINK I'M ON THE OUTS
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

762
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,440
I DEVELOPED A BOND
WITH A LOT OF THE PEOPLE.

763
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,900
>> YOU GOING TO COME OUT?

764
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,068
>> NO, I'M GOING TO GO BACK UP.

765
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,194
>> ALL RIGHT.

766
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,906
YOU SHOULDN'T TRUST ANYONE
IN "SURVIVOR" THAT'S TRUE.

767
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,032
HOLLY WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME AND
SHE TOLD ME...

768
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:35,036
WE SHOOK ON AN ALLIANCE THE
FIRST DAY.

769
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:41,042
SO I'M THINKING HECK, WHAT'S
GOING ON IS ALL I WANT TO KNOW.

770
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,710
>> HERE'S WHAT JIMMY SAID TO ME.

771
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,255
HE SAID AT THIS POINT IN THE
BALL GAME WE SHOULD FOCUS

772
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:50,343
ON STRENGTH AND ALLIANCES
ARE BROKEN ALL THE TIME.

773
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,512
HE SAID THERE'S
TWO WEAK PLAYERS.

774
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,055
>> DID HE INCLUDE HIMSELF
IN THAT?

775
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,056
>> YEAH.

776
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,057
>> OKAY.

777
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,391
>> THE OTHER?

778
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,060
>> WENDY.

779
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,062
>> SO WHO DO YOU THINK
KEEPS THIS IS TRIBE STRONG?

780
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,940
>> I'M NOT... I DON'T KNOW.

781
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:04,899
WHAT DO YOU...

782
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,317
I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT
WHAT TO THINK.

783
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,736
>> I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE
OF THEM IS A BAD CHOICE.

784
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,530
>> UM...

785
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,406
>> WHY DON'T WE
GO AROUND THE CIRCLE

786
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,241
AND HONESTLY SAY
WHO YOU WOULD RATHER.

787
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,284
DOES THAT SOUND FAIR?

788
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,370
>> YEAH.

789
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,371
>> SOUNDS GOOD.

790
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,580
>> SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

791
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,207
>> SOUNDS GOOD.

792
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,214
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

793
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,300
>> THIS IS WHAT I THINK.

794
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,220
I'M OF THE OPINION THAT WE NEED
TO KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG...

795
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,974
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
THAT WE'VE HAD TO REALLY

796
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,934
FEEL EACH OTHER OUT
FOR SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT

797
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,186
AS WHO'S GOING TO GO HOME
AND YOU TRY TO COAX IT OUT

798
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,606
OF PEOPLE,
YOU'RE GETTING TENTATIVENESS,

799
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,442
NERVOUSNESS ABOUT ANYBODY
SAYING A NAME.

800
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,943
>> SO WHAT DO WE SAY?

801
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,445
I DON'T KNOW?

802
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,154
>> UM...

803
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,282
>> IT COULD BE A REAL TOSS

804
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,743
BETWEEN WENDY JO
AND JIMMY JOHNSON.

805
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,453
WE DON'T KNOW HOW EITHER ONE

806
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,287
COULD REALLY PERFORM
IN A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE.

807
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,289
WE'RE MAKING SOME HUNCHES HERE.

808
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,792
WE'RE MAKING SOME GUESSES
AND WENDY JO PROBABLY DOESN'T

809
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,670
ADD A LOT ON THE PHYSICALITY
SIDE OF THE CHALLENGES.

810
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,505
AND I THINK JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
JIMMY JOHNSON

811
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,507
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THE JURY'S
NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU

812
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,258
THE MILLION DOLLARS,
I'M NOT BUYING IT.

813
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,136
IT WILL BE INTERESTING.

814
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,221
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE JUST HOW
THIS THING PLAYS OUT.

815
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,671
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU
IS A TORCH.

816
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,548
GO AHEAD AND GRAB THE TORCH
AND APPROACH THE FLAME.

817
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,467
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

818
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,514
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

819
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,351
BECAUSE IN THIS GAME
FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

820
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,686
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FIRE,
YOU'RE STILL IN THE GAME.

821
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,481
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE,
SO ARE YOU.

822
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,734
WELL, WELCOME TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

823
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,487
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT
FIRST IMPRESSIONS.

824
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,364
JANE, WHAT IS TYPICALLY
THE FIRST IMPRESSION

825
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,406
PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY MEET YOU?

826
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,325
>> THEY MIGHT CALL ME
A SOUTHERN HILLBILLY.

827
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,995
>> I CALL HER "SURVIVOR"
McGUYVER BECAUSE WITHIN AN HOUR

828
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,831
OF HITTING THE BEACH
JANE HAD THE FIRE GOING.

829
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,833
SHE CAN DO ANYTHING HERE.

830
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,417
>> Jeff: JANE, DID YOU KNOW
YOU COULD DO IT?

831
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,211
>> HELL, YEAH,
I KNEW I COULD DO IT.

832
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,880
BECAUSE I SAW AN ARTICLE
THAT YOU WROTE AND IT SAID

833
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,882
"WHY WOULD ANYBODY COME
AND PLAY 'SURVIVOR'

834
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,759
THAT DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE A FIRE?"

835
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,426
>> Jeff: YOU LISTENED
TO SOMETHING I SAID?

836
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,887
>> I TOOK IT TO HEART, TOO,

837
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,890
BECAUSE I PRACTICED
FOR TWO MONTHS.

838
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,350
>> Jeff: JIMMY T.,
HOW BIG WERE THOSE

839
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,270
FIRST FEW MOMENTS FOR YOU
IN MAKING FIRST IMPRESSIONS?

840
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,772
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

841
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,232
WHERE I DO COME FROM
I'M A LEADER.

842
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,441
WHEN I TALK, PEOPLE LISTEN.

843
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,069
WHEN YOU GET TO "SURVIVOR",

844
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,404
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE
STRONGER,

845
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,447
THERE'S PEOPLE WITH MORE
INTEGRITY AND WHEN YOU HAVE

846
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,365
ONE OF THE GREATEST LEADERS
IN THE N.F.L.

847
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,243
OF ALL TIME,
IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING.

848
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,703
I'M JUST ANOTHER PLAYER HERE.

849
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,705
>> Jeff: JIMMY, WHEN YOU HEAR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

850
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,915
DO YOU FEEL A LITTLE TARGET
ON YOUR BACK

851
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,418
THAT PEOPLE WILL EITHER LOOK
TO YOU FOR LEADERSHIP

852
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,545
OR BE ANNOYED
THAT YOU ARE A LEADER?

853
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,922
>> LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR,
I'M NOT THE BOSS.

854
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,424
BUT, YEAH, I'M GOING TO BE

855
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,175
A TARGET EVERY SINGLE
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

856
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,594
I KNOW THAT.

857
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,889
BUT I'M NOT A THREAT TO ANYBODY
HERE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON

858
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:23,472
NO JURY'S GOING TO AWARD ME
A MILLION BUCKS.

859
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,391
I KNOW THAT.

860
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,393
I'M NOT HERE FOR THE MONEY,
I'M HERE FOR THE ADVENTURE.

861
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,563
BUT I'LL ONLY BE HERE AS LONG

862
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,815
AS I CAN HELP THIS TEAM
BE SUCCESSFUL.

863
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,109
>> Jeff: JIMMY T,
CAN YOU BUY THAT?

864
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,111
>> NO WAY, HE'S GOING TO TRY
TO WIN THIS THING.

865
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:38,946
AND I THINK HE CAN WIN THE GAME

866
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,782
BECAUSE IF HE LEADS SO WELL
AND DESERVES TO WIN THE GAME,

867
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,118
THE JURY'S GOING TO LET HIM
WIN THAT GAME.

868
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:46,787
>> Jeff: MARTY, JIMMY T.
BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING POINT.

869
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,790
MOST PEOPLE ON "SURVIVOR"
ARE BORN LEADERS.

870
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,459
IS THAT A SHOCK FOR YOU
TO GET USED TO AS WELL?

871
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,962
>> I THINK COMING INTO IT
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

872
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,465
ABOUT BEING OVER-THE-TOP LEADER
BECAUSE TYPICALLY

873
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,466
THAT PUTS A TARGET
ON YOUR BACK RIGHT AWAY.

874
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,177
SO I THINK THERE'S DIFFERENT
WAYS TO LEAD

875
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,845
AND IT'S MAKING SURE
YOU DON'T LEAD

876
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,680
IN THE WAY
THAT GETS YOU INTO TROUBLE.

877
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,515
>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT
TONIGHT'S VOTE.

878
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,770
WHO HERE BY A SHOW OF HANDS
TRULY THINKS THEY'RE IN TROUBLE?

879
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,647
MORE THAN HALF THE TRIBE.

880
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,482
HOLLY, WHY ARE YOU CONCERNED
IT MIGHT BE YOU TONIGHT?

881
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,110
>> I MADE AN ALLIANCE
RIGHT INTO THE GAME

882
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,821
AND COACH CAME OVER TO ME
AFTER THE CHALLENGE

883
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,157
AND HE FEELS LIKE THERE'S
TWO WEAK LINKS.

884
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,326
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I

885
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,328
NECESSARILY AGREE
WITH WHO HE DECIDES.

886
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,329
SO DEFINITELY.

887
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,666
>> Jeff: WENDY,
WHY DO YOU THINK THE TRIBE

888
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,959
WOULD WANT TO VOTE YOU OUT
TONIGHT?

889
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:36,796
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CONNECTED
VERY WELL WITH THE PEOPLE HERE.

890
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,340
I WAS VERY BUSY BUT SOME PEOPLE
TALKED AT THE CAMP

891
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,635
AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
I GOT A LOT OF THAT.

892
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,387
BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE QUITE
SURPRISED

893
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,889
IF SOMEONE ASKED ME
SOME QUESTIONS.

894
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,016
THERE'S NOBODY HERE
THAT EVEN KNOWS MY AGE.

895
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,017
NOT ONE PERSON ASKED ME.

896
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:50,518
>> I ASKED YOU.

897
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,520
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T.

898
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,896
>> THAT'S ONE QUESTION
I NEVER ASK ANYONE.

899
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,897
>> NO, YOU NEVER ASKED ME!

900
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,357
>> YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO ASK
A WOMAN HER AGE.

901
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,400
>> HOW OLD ARE YOU?

902
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,401
>> 48.

903
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,736
>> YOU LOOK SO YOUNG.

904
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,531
>> Jeff: WENDY, TYPICALLY
THE ONE QUESTION

905
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,535
YOU WOULDN'T ASK A WOMAN
IS "HOW OLD ARE YOU."

906
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,662
SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT THAT'S

907
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,539
THE QUESTION
THAT HAS YOU TWEAKED.

908
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,040
>> OH, IT DOESN'T
HAVE ME TWEAKED,

909
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,376
I JUST FOUND IT INTERESTING
THAT NOBODY ASKED ME.

910
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,377
MAYBE I'LL START
TOOTING MY HORN.

911
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,546
(\LAUGHS\)

912
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,006
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD DO.

913
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,591
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
TALKATIVE AND SHARE EVERYTHING.

914
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,262
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO COME IN
TALK, TALK, TALK,

915
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,931
AND DRIVE PEOPLE CRAZY
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE

916
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,433
WHO TALK ALL THE TIME.

917
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,561
SO I STAYED PRETTY QUIET
AND THAT IS NOT ME.

918
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,188
I HAVE A NICKNAME
OF CHATTER BOX.

919
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,773
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

920
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,233
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

921
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,068
JANE, YOU'RE UP.

922
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,570
>> CAN I SAY ONE THING?

923
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,408
>> Jeff: WENDY, YOU HAD
SOMETHING ELSE

924
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,659
YOU WANTED TO SAY?

925
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,911
>> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TELL
THE GROUP I THINK THERE'S A LOT

926
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,998
THAT I CAN BRING THROUGH
MY STRENGTH, MY LEADERSHIP.

927
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,918
I COULD BE VERY FRIENDLY,
VERY HONEST, VERY FUNNY,

928
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,921
FUN TO BE WITH, STRONG WILLED,
STRONG PHYSICALLY.

929
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,424
PEOPLE LIKE TO BE MY FRIEND.

930
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,633
PEOPLE LIKE TO BE WITH ME.

931
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,677
THEY TRUST ME ALL THE TIME.

932
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,305
TRUST IS IMPORTANT.

933
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:12,600
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY BLISTERS
ON MY FEET AND THAT'S AN ASSET.

934
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:17,563
THAT WILL HELP, JUST A LITTLE
THING I'D POINT OUT.

935
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,940
I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT.

936
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:20,733
>> Jeff: I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE

937
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,235
YOU GET EVERYTHING
OFF YOUR CHEST.

938
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,279
>> THAT'S IT.

939
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,614
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

940
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,115
LET'S GET TO THE VOTE.

941
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,284
JANE, YOU'RE UP.

942
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,647
>> INITIALLY THE DECISION
WAS TOUGH BUT AFTER HEARING

943
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,483
YOU SPEAK TONIGHT WITH YOUR
EXCUSES, IT BECAME EASY.

944
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,736
WENDY JO, YOU GOTTA GO.

945
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,217
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

946
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,688
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

947
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,022
THE PERSON VOTED OUT
WILL BE ASKED

948
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,858
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

949
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,859
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

950
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,989
FIRST VOTE, WENDY.

951
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,034
EVE.

952
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,036
THAT'S ONE VOTE EVE,
ONE VOTE WENDY.

953
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:57,746
WENDY.

954
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,833
TWO VOTES WENDY.

955
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,460
WENDY.

956
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,171
THAT'S THREE VOTES WENDY.

957
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,465
WENDY, THAT'S FOUR VOTES WENDY.

958
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,471
WENDY, THAT'S FIVE VOTES WENDY,
ONE VOTE EVE.

959
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,642
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA," WENDY.

960
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,060
THAT'S SIX, THAT'S ENOUGH.

961
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,188
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

962
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,947
>> Jeff: WENDY, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

963
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,744
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

964
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,713
>> Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S VOTE
WAS CLEARLY DESIGNED

965
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,716
TO IMPROVE THE CHEMISTRY
OF THIS TRIBE.

966
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,635
ONE GOOD THING ABOUT COMING
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,

967
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,928
YOU WILL LEAVE HERE WITH FIRE.

968
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,721
HERE'S YOUR FLINT.

969
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,932
GRAB A TORCH, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

970
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,975
GOOD NIGHT.

971
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,657
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME
ON "SURVIVOR."

972
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,783
>> FATIGUE MAKES
THE MINDS GET WEAK.

973
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,244
>> NEW YORK CITY BOY DANNY,

974
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,496
LET'S JUST FILL HIS SHOES UP
AND THEN...

975
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,789
>> WHY YOU RAISING
YOUR VOICE AT ME?

976
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,792
I CAN GET LOUD, TOO.

977
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,252
I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.

978
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,086
HE GETS ON MY NERVES.

979
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,297
>> Jeff: 21 SEASONS
OF "SURVIVOR,"

980
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,343
NEVER HAD AN OPENING QUESTION
OPEN THAT MUCH WHOOP ASS.

981
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,100
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR.

982
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,228
AND WHAT I FIND INTERESTING
IS THIS IS PROBABLY

983
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,981
THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE
I WAS A LOSER WITH STRANGERS.

984
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,525
I CHANGED COMING INTO THE GAME.

985
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:53,445
IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN MYSELF IT
WOULD HAVE WORKED OUT BETTER.

986
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,697
I WISH I COULD GO BACK.

987
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,823
MAYBE THEY'LL STICK ME
ON THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S TRIBE.
