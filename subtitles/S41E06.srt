to find out is

166
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,723
that even when you earn it,
nothing is guaranteed.

167
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,692
So here's what's going
to happen.

168
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,695
It's the biggest twist so far.
Here they come.

169
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,031
We're going to run a big
challenge, and when it's over,

170
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,899
a group are going to believe
they're safe.

171
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,668
But they're going to be forced

172
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,337
to send one player away,
which is always dangerous,

173
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,239
and in doing so,
they will unknowingly

174
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,842
give that player
a historic amount of power.

175
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,210
And the question' going to be,

176
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,178
what will the player do
with that power?

177
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,247
This one may ruffle
some feathers.

178
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,715
Come on in.

179
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,262
Getting your first look
at the new Ua tribe.

180
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,900
Genie voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

181
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,504
All right, well, as you know
from tree mail,

182
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,241
we are entering the next stage
of the game.

183
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,076
Tribes are no longer.
You are now

184
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,012
in the individual portion
of<i> Survivor.</i>

185
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,314
Everybody drop your Buffs.

186
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,050
-(whooping)
-Yes! Oh, my God, yes!

187
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,620
-Ah.
-You are...

188
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,888
ALL:
Merged!

189
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,256
DESHAWN:
Cool.

190
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,458
Ah...

191
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,159
(all clamoring)

192
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,628
-Not exactly.
-LIANA: Oh!

193
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,529
-Damn it!
-Oh, God, he's killing me.

194
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,633
PROBST:
May be better to say
you're not merged.

195
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,135
In fact, for the moment, you are

196
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,804
without a Buff
and without a tribe.

197
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,974
Like every other thing
so far in this game,

198
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,479
you are going to earn your way
into the merge.

199
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,914
Here's how it's going to work.

200
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,316
We're going to draw
for two teams.

201
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,523
<i>On my go, you're going</i>
<i>to dig up a massive boulder</i>

202
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,993
<i>and push it through</i>
<i>a series of obstacles,</i>

203
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,495
<i>retrieving keys along the way.</i>

204
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,996
<i>When you get to the end,</i>
<i>you'll climb</i>

205
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,599
<i>to the top of the tower,</i>
<i>use those keys</i>

206
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,968
<i>to unlock the</i> Survivor
<i>word puzzle.</i>

207
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,306
First team to finish earns

208
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,510
their first proper meal
in 12 days.

209
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:40,913
Plus, you earn a Buff--
the merge Buff--

210
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,449
and you will not have
to participate

211
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,118
in the first
individual immunity challenge.

212
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,154
You'll be safe.

213
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,324
The losing team--
no proper meal, no Buff,

214
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,326
and you will have to participate

215
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,094
in that challenge
to be safe at Tribal.

216
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,332
And to be clear, everybody will
still vote at Tribal Council.

217
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:03,769
And there's one more layer
to this twist.

218
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:07,606
Two players will draw
gray rocks.

219
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,575
You will not participate
on either team.

220
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,043
You will not run
in the challenge.

221
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,314
Your fate will be decided
by the winning team.

222
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,553
<i>A</i> Survivor<i> player's journey</i>
<i>often comes down to a</i>

226
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,806
Two players will draw
gray rocks.

227
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,909
You will not participate
on either team.

228
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,144
You will not run

229
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,146

00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,753

232
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,624
Everybody reveal.

233
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,366
Who has the gray rocks?

234
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,769
Naseer has a gray,
Erika has a gray.

235
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,570
You two will not participate.

236
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,672
If you have yellow,
go to yellow.

237
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,608
If you have blue, go to blue.

238
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,310
If you have gray,
go in the middle on green.

239
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,380
Game just took another turn.

240
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,583
We've got Naseer and Erika
in the middle,

241
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,919
and we have two teams of five.

242
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:31,457
For yellow, we have
Xander, Heather, Liana,

243
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,125
Tiffany and Shan.

244
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,861
On the other team,
we have Danny, Ricard,

245
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,631
Sydney, Deshawn and Evvie.

246
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,132
Liana, where are we in the game?

247
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,434
This is another new twist.

248
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,902
You don't just waltz
into the merge.

249
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,271
You got to earn the merge.

250
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,207
Yeah, it's-it's really real,
Jeff. (laughs)

251
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,477
I'm super hungry right now,
and when Liana's hungry,

252
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,646
she's feisty,
so I want to win this.

253
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,682
All right, Naseer
and Erika will watch.

254
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,084
Everybody else, give you
a minute to strategize,

255
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,286
we'll get started.

256
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,461
Here we go for food,

257
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,831
Buff and immunity
at that first Tribal Council.

258
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,365
Big stakes.

259
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,301
Survivors ready.

260
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,670

It looks like

267
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,319
there is a big
physical advantage for blue,

268
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,422

to be seen right now.

337
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,533
Closer to that meal,
that Buff and immunity.

338
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,006
Blue now got to get up
to that tower

339
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,342
using only the ball
and each other.

340
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,944
-I got it. I got it.
-NASEER: "Evie."

341
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,779
-Nicely done, Evie.
-Good job, Evvie.
Good job, Evvie.

342
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,981
-It's "Evvie"?
-Evvie.

343
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,416
-Nice one, Evvie!
-Good job, Evvie!

344
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,753
And here comes yellow.
Keep moving! Push!

345
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,955
You never know
when there is a word puzzle,

346
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,990
how long it will take
the other group.

347
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,759
Push that ball!

348
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,461
-Here goes Ricard!
-(grunting)

349
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,730
Look at that human ladder!

350
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,832
-Yeah, let's go.
-Danny, Deshawn and Ricard.

351
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,936
That is how you do it in this
challenge, but they are up.

352
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,905
Now it's a human ladder
to get to the top.

353
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,307
-Let's go.
-(grunting)

354
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,675
Sydney goes up
on Danny's shoulders.

355
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,110
(grunts)
Got it, got it, got it.

356
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,713
-(grunting)
-Got it. One, two, three. Go.

357
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,983
-Keep going! You're in it.
-Keep going...

358
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,185
PROBST:
Yellow, still fighting.
Exhausted but still in it.

359
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,720
Come on, yellow!

360
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,588
Keep moving! Get that ball back!
You got to get that second...

361
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,757
-Slow it down. Slow it down.
-This way?

362
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,494
-Catch, catch, catch.
-PROBST: There goes Deshawn.

363
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,029
-He's gonna give it a go.
-(grunting)

364
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,832
Holding on by his fingertips.
That'll do it.

365
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,300
-SYDNEY: You got this.
-Now Danny on his own,

366
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,070
gonna have to scale this wall.

367
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,605
-And he's got it.
-Yeah, Danny.

368
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,074
Wow. Made it look easy.

369
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,009
Puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.

370
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,913
PROBST: All right, on the mat.
Two people on the puzzle.

371
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,449
Got to unlock it.

372
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,119
Flip that center piece
and start sliding pieces.

373
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,454
Two different stories.

374
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,422
-One team trying
to solve the puzzle.
-Yeah.

375
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,858
The other team just trying
to get up here.

376
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,893
-More.
-You got it.
Tiffany, go, baby.

377
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,028
Yes. (grunts)

378
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,830
-Go, go, go, go!
-Tiff, come on!

379
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,899
Blue continuing to move
one piece at a time.

380
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,501
-Uh, tribe.
-Merge, merge, merge.

381
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,602
Merge, merge, merge.
Merge, merge.

382
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,671
Getting closer and closer.

383
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,072
Pull, pull!
Hold, Xander. Come on.

384
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,341
-Yellow has four people up.
-Come on, Xander.

385
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,411
-Let's go... We got it.
-PROBST: Look at that. No quit!

386
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,279
-That's it!
-Go, go, go, go, go.

387
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,382
Let's go! Start
that human ladder right now.

388
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,450
-Right here, right here!
-PROBST: Yellow, you are still

389
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,119
in this challenge.

390
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,788
Here goes Liana.

391
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,656
Can she pull herself up?

392
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,959
Very little strength left
in that body,

393
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:10,095
-but she is using all of it.
-TIFFANY: You got it, baby.

394
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,097
-Struggling.
-I got you, baby. I got you.

395
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,099
PROBST:
Holding on to anything.

396
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,934
Look at that effort!
Nice job.

397
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,903
-Nice, Liana.
-Nice work.

398
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,204
Keep put...
moving 'em all down.

399
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,272
Move 'em all down.

400
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,573
PROBST:
Blue's struggling now.

401
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,609
-Yes, yes, yes!
-(indistinct chatter)

402
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,811
-RICARD: Yeah, it all goes here.
-PROBST: Yellow now in this.

403
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,514
Here comes Heather.
She's gonna need a hand.

404
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,383
-Come on.
-You ready?

405
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,352
-(grunting)
-(indistinct shouting)

406
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,288
-SHAN: Come on, Heather.
-(Heather groans)

407
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,457
-Come on, Heather.
-We are not letting you go.

408
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,627
-You got this.
-Give her a push, Shan!
Come on, Heather!

409
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,928
-Come on, Heather!
-Pull!

410
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,496
-Come on, Heather!
-Go, go, go!

411
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,331
Look at that.

412
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,934
One of the most amazing displays
of teamwork

413
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,702
in the history of this game.

414
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,337
Here comes Shan.

415
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,141
Shan is up. Xander, get up here.
You could be back in this.

416
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,643
Xander gonna give it a run.
Let's go.

417
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,244
Time is ticking.

418
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,447
Hold me. Hold me. Shan, hold me.

419
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,782
-Nice!
-Come on. Come on.

420
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,950
-Xander's got it!
-(groans)

421
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,618
-Get on the puzzle. Let's go.
-(groaning)

422
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,988
Suddenly, we got a challenge.

423
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,623
-Wait, wait...
-No, A, A, A.

424
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,159
-No, A's first.
-PROBST:
Blue had the early lead.

425
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,395
But I think that lead is gone.

426
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,801
It would be a huge comeback if
yellow came back and won this.

427
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,304
(indistinct chatter)

428
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,973
Anything is possible
on<i> Survivor.</i>

429
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,143
-EVVIE: You got this, dude.
-PROBST: This could

430
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,712
come down to seconds
and a few pieces.

431
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,247
I know. This is gonna look
weird. Give me a second.

432
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,850
-You got it. You got it.
-You got it. You got it.

433
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,952
Suddenly blue is moving quickly.

434
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,587
Yes, you're so right.
You're totally right.

435
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,021
Wait. No, no, no, we want...
It's not...

436
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,256
We're not...
not going backwards.

437
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,824
Is it "Merge Feast"?

438
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,326
Now it's yellow
who's slowing down.

439
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,727
-Amazing, bro.
-You're right, Ric.

440
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,196
PROBST:
You could not ask for more

441
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,199
on day 12 of<i> Survivor 41.</i>

442
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,168
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Wait, wait, wait.

443
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,103
-Amazing, bro.
-Wait. Oh, that's good.

444
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,339
-Bring it down.
-Yes. Jeff?
-Jeff.

445
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,673
Blue thinks they have it.
Say it!

446
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,475
-ALL: Merge Feast!
-That's it!

447
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,813
-Yes!
-Blue wins the first meal
of the season.

448
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,314
Congrats, guys!

449
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,184
A tribe merge Buff and immunity

450
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,853
at that first
individual challenge.

451
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,725
And what a huge effort
by yellow to get back in this.

452
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,227
(indistinct chatter)

453
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,463
Danny, Evvie,

454
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,698
Ricard, Deshawn, Sydney,

455
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,600
boat's going to take you
to the sanctuary.

456
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,837
Beautiful spot where
you will have a proper meal,

457
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,840
plus tribe Buffs,
the merge Buff.

458
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,209
Ooh...

459
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,846
And you don't have to compete
in that first individual

460
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,648
immunity challenge.
You are safe

461
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,884
at that first Tribal Council.
Before you head out,

462
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,686
a very big decision to make.

463
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,723
You are going to choose either
Naseer or Erika to join you.

464
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,393
The person you choose
to join you--

465
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,562
for them, it will be
as if they won--

466
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,598
food, Buff and immunity.

467
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,669
A very big strategic decision
because that is a gift.

468
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,637
For the other person,

469
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,006
they'll be taken
to a separate island,

470
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,410
where they will live alone
for two days,

471
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,313
two nights, no proper meal,

472
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,715
no Buff, no immunity,

473
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,318
no company, no shelter.

474
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,320
So for very different reasons,

475
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:26,024
also a strategic decision,
so talk about it.

476
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,859
Big decision.

477
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,496
One person gets a gift,
one person gets sent away,

478
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,198
which is always dangerous.

479
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,967
All right, before you tell me,

480
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:39,104
what was the thought process
for your decision?

481
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,572
Paper, rock, scissors.

482
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,241
PROBST:
Really?

483
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,844
It's our tribemates, and,
you know, it's hard to choose,

484
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,014
-and, uh...
-So rock, paper, scissor?

485
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,816
Yup.

486
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,485
PROBST:
Okay.

487
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,656
So, blue, who is going
to join you for the Merge Feast?

488
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,524
Uh, Naseer.

489
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,926
-(whoops)
-PROBST: Naseer, come on over.

490
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,996
Guys. I love you guys.

491
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,433
-Sorry, E.
-It's okay.

492
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,103
PROBST:
All right, you six gonna have
a great afternoon together.

493
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,137
Grab your stuff, head out.

494
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,739
Boat'll take you
to the sanctuary.

495
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,808
Enjoy.

496
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,078
-DESHAWN: Good luck. You got it.
-Good luck, guys.

497
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,947
PROBST:
Xander, Liana, Tiffany,

498
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,316
Shan, Heather,
consolation prize?

499
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,752
You'll have a little bit of rice
waiting for you back at camp,

500
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:30,022
enough for the day.
You're heading to Luvu tribe.

501
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,957
This will be your merge home.

502
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,592
Grab your stuff, head out.

503
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,927
The game continues.

504
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,230
Enjoy, guys.
Have a good day.

505
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,998
-Thank you. We will.
-Sorry, Erika.

506
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,000
-We got you.
-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.

507
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,137
I'll be okay.

508
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,440
Erika,
how you feeling right now?

509
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,409
You're left behind.

510
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,980
Yeah, I mean, I had suspicions
that I was at the bottom.

511
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,782
Maybe this just proved it.

512
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:57,849
I honestly thought that

513
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,552
when the choice was
between Naseer and I, like,

514
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,187
I was dead in the water.

515
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,822
So maybe the rock, paper,
scissors was, you know,

516
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,925
like, a nice cover
to not hurt my feelings,

517
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,796
but I never expected
to join the feast.

518
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,998
Well, Erika,
there is no denying it.

519
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,000
Your game just took
a dramatic turn.

520
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,768
Grab your stuff, head out.

521
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,236
Boat will take you
to the island

522
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,907
where you will spend two days
and two nights alone.

523
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,675
Good luck.

524
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,611
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>Hearing I was going to be alone</i>

525
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,014
<i>on an island</i>
<i>is honestly a nightmare.</i>

526
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,917
My first 12 days
on<i> Survivor</i> is not

527
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,385
what I thought was going
to happen.

528
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,455
<i>I didn't expect</i>
<i>to have moments where</i>

529
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,291
I was perfectly safe
and feel so powerless.

530
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:43,128
<i>I didn't expect to be exiled</i>
<i>for two days, but, like,</i>

531
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,630
<i>as long as I get it done</i>
<i>and I do it,</i>

532
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,233
that's what matters.

533
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,854
<i>EVVIE:</i>
<i>I'm a huge fan of</i> Survivor,

534
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,289
<i>and there has never</i>
<i>been anything like this.</i>

535
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,924
Only the winners
of the challenge

536
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,727
officially make the merge
and get a Merge Feast.

537
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,998
<i>Losing the challenge</i>
<i>and not getting the feast?</i>

538
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,434
<i>That's got to be heartbreaking,</i>
<i>absolutely heartbreaking.</i>

539
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,269
-EVVIE: Oh, my God.
-(whooping)

540
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,438
<i>EVVIE:</i>
<i>Winning this challenge is huge.</i>
<i>It means</i>

541
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,206
I officially made the merge,

542
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,143
it means I have immunity for
the first vote after the merge,

543
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,146
<i>and most importantly,</i>
<i>it means I get to eat.</i>

544
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,414
-Who wants a beer?
-DANNY: I do.

545
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,049

<i>EVVIE:</i>
<i>I've seen every season</i>
<i>of</i> Survivor,

547
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,820

<i>really believe</i>

548
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,322
<i>that this is one</i>
<i>of the hardest ever. Like,</i>

549
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,793
it cannot be overstated what
not having rice means. Like,

550
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,897
<i>there are many days, where I ate</i>
<i>literally zero calories.</i>

551
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:52,898
Zero calories.

552
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,199
Yo, real talk? We,

553
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,734
the last three days,
ate nothing.

554
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,169
Like, nothing nothing.

555
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,671
EVVIE:
Yeah.

556
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,807
It is probably the
toughest thing I've ever done.

557
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,345
-Yeah.
<i>-NASEER: It's a great day</i>
<i>for me.</i>

558
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,848
This is what I got.
This is, like...

559
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,718
I feel like my... the individual
immunity is around my neck

560
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,421
for the first challenge, so...

561
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,990
Smells really good,
and I love the color.

562
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,725
You guys think
Erika's gonna be okay?

563
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,260
-DESHAWN: I hope so.
-I hope so.
-DANNY: I really hope so.

564
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,662
-That is a rough punishment.
-Yeah...

565
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,931
-But she's, like,
super happy-go-lucky.
-Is she?

566
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,066
-You think she...?
-DESHAWN: She's gonna
make the best of it.

567
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,734
<i>NASEER:</i>
<i>And also I have</i>

568
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,870
<i>a hidden immunity idol</i>

569
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,673

<i>First Tribal Council,</i>

SYDNEY (laughing):
Yeah.

Do we...? Do you like Erika?

575
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,082
EVVIE:
Yeah, I was gonna ask.

576
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,550
-RICARD: Okay.
-DANNY: We hadn't really got

577
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,052
a chance to play the game,
so it's been,

578
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,754
like, true harmony
in the... in the tribe. Like...

579
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,723
<i>I do feel bad for Erika</i>
<i>that she's out there</i>

580
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,491
<i>for two days alone, but</i>

581
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,694
<i>we didn't want</i>
<i>to send Naseer because</i>

582
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,563
the real situation is,
a lot of the men were voted out.

583
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,668
<i>But nobody really wanted to</i>
<i>explain why we chose Naseer, so,</i>

584
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,003
<i>first thing that popped</i>
<i>in my head</i>

585
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,072
<i>from old</i> Survivor<i> seasons was</i>

586
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,139
paper, rock, scissors.

587
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,875
EVVIE:
Huh?

588
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,878
You got it right.

589
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,512
I'm still worried. (laughs)

590
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,314
We assumed
you would be afraid.

591
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,351
<i>DANNY:</i>
<i>I thought it was pretty obvious</i>

592
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,353
<i>that the women were kind of</i>

593
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,021
<i>knocking the men out</i>
<i>on the other tribe.</i>

594
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,657
<i>So it was really,</i>
<i>really important for us</i>

595
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,592
<i>to keep the men's numbers up.</i>

596
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,295
So we needed
to keep Naseer safe.

597
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,731
<i>The truth is, a woman</i>
<i>definitely has to go home,</i>

598
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,634
<i>and I think</i>
<i>Erika makes 100% the most sense.</i>

599
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,786
Okay.

600
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,262
<i>Of the things that I absolutely</i>
<i>did not want to happen to me</i>

601
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,666
<i>on</i> Survivor,<i> number one</i>
<i>on the list was "Be alone</i>

602
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,834
on a beach for one night,"

603
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,204
and it is happening times two.

604
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,845
Oh, yeah,
Jeff wasn't messing around.

605
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,447
I really don't get a lot.

606
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,782
<i>Being alone</i>

607
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:27,085
for that amount of time
almost seems scarier than

608
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,487
<i>not being in the game</i>
<i>for two days.</i>

609
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,957
What's in here? Okay.

610
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,726
Okay. We have some rice
on the menu.

611
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,028
This one looks promising.

612
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,366
Oh, it's water.

613
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,867
Okay.

614
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,904
<i>It just felt so daunting.</i>

615
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,706
I immediately had the fear
of like,

616
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,308
am I going to, like,
literally survive?

617
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,043
Am I going to be
able to stay alive?

618
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,719
<i>I didn't come into</i> Survivor
<i>with a lot of outdoor skills.</i>

619
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,555
And the person least equipped
to be outside is me.

620
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,291
<i>But I've been used</i>

621
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:10,829
<i>to, like, things never coming</i>
<i>easy for me in life. Like,</i>

622
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,597
growing up in Canada,

623
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,834
<i>like, always looking different</i>
<i>than the other kids</i>

624
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,871
<i>and knowing, like, how</i>
<i>many challenges my parents had</i>

625
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,173
<i>in trying to, like,</i>
<i>give us a good life.</i>

626
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,477
<i>Coming from the Philippines</i>
<i>to Canada,</i>

627
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:29,748
<i>working so many jobs</i>
<i>to, like, keep us going.</i>

628
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,817
<i>I know that, like,</i>
<i>it probably hurts them that</i>

629
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,286
they didn't have as much, like,
time with us, like, growing up

630
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,489
as they would have wanted to.

631
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,025
But I know that, like...

632
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,395
that everything they did, like,

633
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,296
set me up with, like, the skills
to be able

634
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,998
to, like, achieve
what I want to do.

635
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:53,304
<i>I'm just so used to, like,</i>
<i>things not being handed to me,</i>

636
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,908
<i>but I just, like, always am able</i>
<i>to, like, somehow, like,</i>

637
00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:00,879
<i>persevere and figure out,</i>
<i>like, how to get through it.</i>

638
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,883
Oh, my God. Please stay.
Please stay lit.

639
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,685
<i>It's been such a dream</i>
<i>to be on</i> Survivor,

640
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,321
<i>and I can't believe</i>
<i>that I'm here.</i>

641
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,091
<i>In many ways, me being</i>
<i>on</i> Survivor<i> is almost</i>

642
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,826
<i>like a love letter to my parents</i>

643
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,395
<i>to let them know that, um,</i>

644
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:21,099
<i>like, everything they did,</i>
<i>like, gave me what I need</i>

645
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,668
<i>to survive out here.</i>
<i>And I don't know.</i>

646
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,439
<i>I actually think that</i>
<i>if I can survive here,</i>

647
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,842
<i>survive, like,</i>
<i>double my</i> Survivor<i> nightmare,</i>

648
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,478
<i>I'm going to come back</i>
<i>into the game, like,</i>

649
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,849
still looking like a lamb
but ready to play like a lion.

650
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,992
Wow.

651
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,268
Well, that sucked.

652
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,837
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>Because of that challenge,</i>

653
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,905
<i>I'm covered from head to toe</i>

654
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,576
<i>in bruises and bumps,</i>
<i>scrapes and dirt.</i>

655
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,078
And I felt like I looked--

656
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:11,149
<i>just completely disheveled,</i>
<i>downtrodden.</i>

657
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,084
I haven't even made it
to the merge yet.

658
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,419
I mean, this is like

659
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,921
<i>-a merge-atory.</i>
-All right, can we get that?

660
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:20,325
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>I want to ensure</i>
<i>that I get there, so,</i>

661
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,127
<i>it's possible</i>
<i>that playing my idol now</i>

662
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,862
<i>or winning immunity</i>

663
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,865
is the only thing that's going
to keep me in this game.

664
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,473
I knew you had it.

665
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,475
I wouldn't have shared it

666
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,177
with anybody.
You did the right thing.

667
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,845
I didn't play 'cause

831
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,627
that looks like you? Me, too."

832
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,163
And so, you have this bond
and this connection

833
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,165
<i>right off the bat. We do want</i>
<i>to uplift one another</i>

834
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,368
<i>in this game, and that would be</i>
<i>a really beautiful thing.</i>

835
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,470
SHAN:
Right.

836
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,773
-Delicious.
-Guys, let's really do it.
-Let's do it. Let's do it.

837
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,841
<i>DESHAWN:</i>
<i>Recently I made some new friends</i>

838
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,778
<i>and new allies</i>
<i>in Shan and Liana.</i>

839
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,080
I'm going to be honest.
I'm a guy from San Bernardino.

840
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,516
I'm used to being around a lot
of African American people.

841
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,052
<i>But I thought that I probably</i>
<i>wouldn't get a chance</i>

842
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,187
<i>to play with Black people</i>
<i>in this game.</i>

843
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,289
And that's not the case.

844
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,660
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

845
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,362
As long as it's not one of us.

846
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,698
<i>This season, the beauty</i>
<i>of having a diverse cast is</i>

847
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:14,732
<i>that it kind of</i>

848
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,201
busts your possibilities
wide open, you know?

849
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,636
<i>And everybody is kind of</i>

850
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,037
<i>bringing something to the table.</i>
<i>It's like,</i>

851
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,305
"Well, we got an arsenal here.

852
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,974
We would be foolish not
to work together."

853
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:25,977
(Liana laughs)

854
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,901
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>I was sitting</i>
<i>in my little exile home,</i>

855
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,870
<i>and I see this boat pull up.</i>

856
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,606
<i>It looks</i>
<i>like Jeff is on the boat.</i>

857
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:59,644
<i>It made me think, like,</i>
<i>"Okay, I'm actually crazy."</i>

858
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,847
Like, there's no way
Jeff is making house calls.

859
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,849
-What?
-Take me in. Let me see what...

860
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,851
Are you serious? Oh, my God.

861
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:07,918
<i>Jeff doesn't just show up</i>

862
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,987
to tribe camps for no reason.

863
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,224
<i>And he certainly doesn't</i>
<i>show up to Exile.</i>

864
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,960
-So you kept
the fire going all night?
-Yes.

865
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,529
Working on the fire
is what kept me sane.

866
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,332
I think that if I didn't have
this little fire

867
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,700
that I felt
like I was taking care of,

868
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,269
I probably would have just laid
in a ball and cried.

869
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,271
So let's talk about
the emotional part of that.

870
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:31,942
-Yeah.
-Because this game can take you
on some wild journeys.

871
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,413
-Yes.
-And when the decision was made,

872
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,048
however it was made,

873
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,417
the result was,
you were sent here alone.

874
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,452
What does that feel like

875
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,122
when it is really just you here
with your thoughts?

876
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,559
I feel like... I just feel like
I was left behind.

877
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:52,897
I feel like coming here and
having to spend two days alone

878
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,399
when the merge happened--
which is so important--

879
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:59,503
it feels like... like I have
so much catch-up to do.

880
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,972
Well, it doesn't have
to be that way,

881
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,975
because in sending you out here,
what they didn't know is

882
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,877
they gave you
tremendous power.

883
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,613
Oh, my God.
I was hoping for something.

884
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,385
This... is an hourglass.

885
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:18,522
The black sand at the bottom
of this hourglass represents

886
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,858
the time
that has already passed.

887
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,894
-This is the history of what
has happened in the game.
-Yeah.

888
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:28,099
If you want, you can leave
the game in its natural state,

889
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,900
and the events
that have happened happened,

890
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,436
-what is is,
that's our history.
-Yeah.

891
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,707
Or if you want,
you can go back in time

892
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,709
and change history.

893
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:42,046
You have the power
to reverse the outcome

894
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,315
of yesterday's merge challenge.

895
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:46,450
-Oh, my God.
-So those that have immunity

896
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,119
would have it stripped
from them.

897
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,253
They would have to compete,

898
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,155
one of the six of them
would be voted out.

899
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,324
You and the other five
would be safe

900
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,426
and guaranteed a spot
in the final 11.

901
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,794
Oh, my God.

902
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,662
I'm gonna leave you with this.

903
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,731
If you want to do nothing,

904
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,267
then just leave everything
as it is.

905
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:07,638
But if you want to make history
by changing history...

906
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,981
Oh, my gosh. How much time
do I have to think about this?

907
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,349
Tomorrow morning
before you leave the beach,

908
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:19,583
you got to make your decision.

909
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,087
-Oh, my gosh.
-Game is always changing.

910
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,256
You've earned your spot
out here.

911
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:26,624
You're still in the game.

912
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,392
What you do with this decision
is up to you.

913
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,361
It's obviously
a big strategic decision.

914
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,763
-I'm going to leave you with it.
-Jeff.

915
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:37,201
<i>Not only has Jeff created this</i>
<i>single game-changing decision.</i>

916
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,304
(singsongy):
Little old me gets to make it!

917
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,440
<i>The little girl from Canada</i>
<i>who's much smaller</i>

918
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,142
<i>than everyone else,</i>
<i>who everyone was okay</i>

919
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:49,847
<i>with sending to exile,</i>
<i>gets to make this decision? Oh,</i>

920
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,016
my... God!

921
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,618
<i>What makes it complicated</i>

922
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,354
<i>is, the six who are safe</i>
<i>are the majority</i>

923
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,124
<i>of my original tribe.</i>

924
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,294
<i>So this could burn bridges</i>
<i>with people</i>

925
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,263
<i>that I do have some type</i>
<i>of trust with.</i>

926
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,999
<i>No matter what I do,</i>
<i>I'm probably going to lay awake</i>

927
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,334
<i>for the next few nights,</i>
<i>wondering</i>

928
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,336
<i>if I did the right thing.</i>

929
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,773
People are going to talk
about this one for a long time,

930
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,007
<i>and it's a lot of pressure.</i>

931
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,364
Whatever I do,
there are going to be people

932
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,765
<i>who are going</i>
<i>to be upset with me.</i>

933
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:49,406
I had the opportunity
to change the events of history.

934
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,941
-Wow.
-SHAN: Oh, my God.

935
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,610
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>That's a curveball.</i>

936
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,944
<i>EVVIE:</i>
<i>This is literally life</i>
<i>or death for me.</i>

937
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,046
What decision did you make?

938
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,237
(roars)
