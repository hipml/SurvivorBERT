00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:27,613
All right, let's get to today's

194
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,949
challenge.

195
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:30,700
Here in Guatemala, you guys are

196
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,995
surrounded by ruins that are in

197
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,664
various stages of excavation by

198
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,498
archaeologists who are searching

199
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,001
for more clues into the Maya

200
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:40,626
culture.

201
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,711
That plays into today's

202
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,004
challenge.

203
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,172
You're going to build an

204
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,174
archaeologist's tent.

205
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:46,799
You will be blindfolded and tied

206
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,551
together in groups.

207
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,053
One person on each tribe will be

208
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,180
your set of eyes.

209
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:52,597
They will guide you.

210
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,515
Scattered amongst these ruins

211
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,642
will be nine bundles of items.

212
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,519
Once you've found all nine

213
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,604
bundles, take off your

214
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,813
blindfolds, start putting the

215
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,564
tent together.

216
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,941
Poles to build the frame, a tarp

217
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,403
for the top, and rope to keep it

218
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:07,737
all together.

219
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,031
First tribe to complete it

220
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,032
correctly wins reward.

221
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,033
Want to know what you're playing

222
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:12,992

223
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,577

00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,668
All right, I need callers.

230
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,753
Nakum?

231
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,630

Gary will be the set of eyes.

236
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,968
We'll get you blindfolded and

237
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:31,844
we'll get started.

238
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,638
Pick a spot.

239
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,559
Here we go, guys.

240
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,563
For reward, survivors ready?

241
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,148
Go!

Keep walking till you hit it.

00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,870
>> The crocs are around here.

572
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:37,871
We got to go out a little bit

573
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:38,247
further.

574
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:38,706
>> They're all over.

575
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,708
>> They're all over.

576
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,291
>> It's just so hot out, and,

577
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,585
God, that water is just so

578
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,753
tempting.

579
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,006
>> Who's not going?

580
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,759
>> That's all right.

581
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,553
>> I'm going to get off, too.

582
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,721
I'm not getting in there.

583
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,805
I've worked with alligators.

584
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,807
They behave like crocs do,

585
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,725
and I know they're out there,

586
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,726
even though we can't see them.

587
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,643
There's probably hundreds in

588
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,063
this lake, if not more.

589
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,067
>> We're touching or no?

590
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,236
Uh, yeah, we're touching a

591
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:09,862
little bit.

592
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:10,863
>> Everybody watches each

593
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,530
other's backs for the

594
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,531
crocodiles, we'll be all right,

595
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:12,698
man.

596
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,241
>> Yeah, just look, man.

597
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,577
>> Eventually, you just say

598
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,911
screw it, man, I'll just jump

599
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,246
in, chance it.

600
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,123
Live on the edge a little bit,

601
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,958
you know?

602
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:23,834
>> They think they're safe

603
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,669
'cause they're in the deep part.

604
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,795
But alligators go deeper when it

605
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,087
gets hot.

606
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,255
They have to regulate their own

607
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,298
body temperature so they're

608
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,174
deeper right now.

609
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,133
They don't care.

610
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,968
They're taking the risk.

611
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,887
They can do what they want.

612
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,013
>> I have to get up.

613
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,515
>> Yeah, baby, go ahead.

614
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,854
>> The brave may not live long,

615
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,355
but the cautious don't live at

616
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,565
all.

617
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,274
And I've never felt more alive

618
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,652
in my entire life.

619
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,738
(<i> laughs</i> )

620
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,880
>> I'm pulling my workload

621
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,840
around camp, because I'm mostly

622
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,217
worried about what my tribe sees

623
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:13,884
me as.

624
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,427
I want to be considered an asset

625
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,804
on this tribe.

626
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,931
You have to be a provider, and I

627
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,641
believe I am.

628
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,266
Guys, come get it while it's hot

629
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,811
'cause it might stick.

630
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,394
>> Dinner's the same old corn

631
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,105
mush.

632
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,606
It's similar to oatmeal, but not

633
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,190
as good.

634
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,484
Sort of crunchy, like a crunchy,

635
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,778
softish...

636
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,362
stuck-in-your-teeth kind of

637
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,280
meal, I guess you could say.

638
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,533
>> I'm already getting sick of

639
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,034
this smell.

640
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,452
>> Come on, dude, I can't eat

641
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,036
this corn.

642
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:41,286
>> Mmm!

643
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,288
Everybody, mmm!

644
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,665
>> We have been eating the

645
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,542
same taste every meal, every

646
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,292
day, and we just need something

647
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,919
else.

648
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,545
Like, even throwing dirt in the

649
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,547
corn almost makes it taste

650
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,756
better because it's something

651
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,050
different, and that's all we're

652
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:55,467
craving right now.

653
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,260
Like, anything different, we

654
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,428
will eat.

655
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,222
>> Look at that?

656
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,557
>> What is that?

657
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,767
>> They said it's termites.

658
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,520
>> That's disgusting.

659
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:06,895
>> Ew, stop it.

660
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,480
>> Well, I just want to see...

661
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,356
>> Please don't do that.

662
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,649
I'm not going to be your friend

663
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,316
anymore, Rafe.

664
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,276
>> If I eat termites?

665
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,403
>> Yeah.

666
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,279
>> Ew, Rafe!

667
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,947
>> They taste good.

668
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,573
>> Gary, please, stop doing that

669
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,282
or I'm not going to be your

670
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,783
friend, either.

671
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,659
>> Did you like them, Gary?

672
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:20,951
>> Oh, yeah.

673
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:21,577
>> I think that they're better

674
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,327
than those ants we had.

675
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,328
There's probably more fat in

676
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,913
them.

677
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,873
>> Why don't you cook them up

678
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:26,081
then?

679
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,291
Don't like eat them alive.

680
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,792
>> Today was a day of

681
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,252
interesting food items.

682
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,045
We started eating termites.

683
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,547
They were good protein, not good

684
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,299
tasting.

685
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,259
>> Good?

686
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,470
>> Protein.

687
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,726
>> What do you guys want to do

688
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,602
with this stuff right now?

689
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,477
>> We<i> could</i> put it over our

690
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,521
existing shelter.

691
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,230
>> We'd get more use out of it

692
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,149
if we tied it up.

693
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:52,608
>> I agree.

694
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,318
>> There was a little bit of

695
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,069
discussion on how to put the

696
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:56,737
tarp on.

697
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,779
People always have different

698
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,114
ideas on how things should be

699
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:00,741
done, but, you know, we all work

700
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,450
as a team.

701
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,618
>> Well, I want to go here, and

702
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,243
then I'm gonna go to that corner

703
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,787
and tie it and go all the way

704
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,038
around it.

705
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:06,580
>> The guys are trying to

706
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,124
construct a canopy for us to

707
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,292
sleep under, but it's just

708
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,710
interesting how it's taking, you

709
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,921
know, a while.

710
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,005
>> This thing's so heavy, if

711
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:15,631
rain were to pool on top of it,

712
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,215
it'll collapse.

713
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,759
>> Why don't we all pull a

714
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:18,967
corner?

715
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,886
>> Um, if you're going to slant

716
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,512
it, you got to decide which way

717
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,097
you want to slant it.

718
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,224
The way this is, if you have it

719
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,392
on there, the canopy may just go

720
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,269
like this, slide along the

721
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,437
string like this.

722
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,649
So knot it so it doesn't slide,

723
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,902
and then do your others.

724
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,903
>> You know, we don't need a

725
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,904
supervisor.

726
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:39,905
This thing is supposed to be

727
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,906
fun, you know?

728
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:41,156
>> Ready?

729
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,202
>> Yeah.

730
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,578
>> I don't understand how they

731
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,746
were putting it together 'cause

732
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,457
it was supposed to be a lean.

733
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,542
It looks like we got a, uh,

734
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,462
circus big top for a shelter.

735
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,090
Am I impressed?

736
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:02,636
(<i> chuckles</i> ): No answer.

737
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,055
>> You have no idea, man.

738
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,432
>> Margaret pretty much hand-

739
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,769
directed building the tent, and,

740
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,395
I don't know, I'm 28 years old.

741
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,356
You just can't tell grown men

742
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,358
what to do all the time.

743
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,359
>> She's playing that mother hen

744
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,151
role.

745
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:18,402
>> Yeah.

746
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,028
>> I'm not here to take any

747
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,071
orders from her.

748
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:21,697
I'm like you, man, I'm basically

749
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,908
just here to have fun, man, and

750
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,159
experience it all.

751
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,828
As soon as somebody comes in and

752
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,246
tries to enforce all these

753
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,708
rules, that ain't fun, man.

754
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,792
Margaret just comes in,

755
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,085
"We need this, we need that,"

756
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,294
da, da, da, da, da, da.

757
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,546
Come on, man.

758
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,380
Starting to bark orders this

759
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,425
early is-is not a good thing.

760
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,884
Nobody's going to tell me what

761
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,051
to do.

762
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,469
The only people who tell me what

763
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,471
to do is my boss and my wife,

764
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,724
that's it.

765
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,577
>> We got some tree mail, baby.

766
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,164
>> Exciting, exciting!

767
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,166
>> Let's see what it says.

768
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:14,791
>> "The ancient Maya

769
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,542
civilization embraced sport.

770
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,669
Considered nobles, the warriors

771
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,754
would adorn themselves in

772
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,173
ceremonial garb and body paint.

773
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,215
When a team of warriors would

774
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,051
lose, the cost would be a human

775
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:24,384
sacrifice.

776
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,761
You will do the same tonight at

777
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,428
Tribal Council."

778
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,764
>> Oh, you guys, look-it.

779
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,015
>> Oh, fun!

780
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,349
>> Oh, cool!

781
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,143
>> A tree mail came with a big

782
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,978
basket full of feathers, little

783
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:35,604
bands full of color, lots of

784
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,440
body paint and brushes.

785
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,983
>> I'm going to do football

786
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:40,275
lines, yeah.

787
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,860
>> You bet.

788
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,527
>> It's fun, because

789
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,737
before I go to Chiefs football

790
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,571
games, we<i> always</i> paint ourselves

791
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,573
up, so it's right up my alley.

792
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,574
Can I put a feather in your

793
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,284
hair?

794
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,494
Nakum is such a strong tribe.

795
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,788
We've won four out of the five

796
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,955
challenges now.

797
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,457
So there's no reason why we

798
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,458
shouldn't go in and win this

799
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,628
one.

800
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,005
>> Guys, we are going to win!

801
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:02,714
(<i> whooping</i> )

802
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,049
>> We're gonna win, Yaxha!

803
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,467
We got immunity!

804
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:05,801
We got it, guys.

805
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,511
We need it, we're the underdogs.

806
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,637
Do it for your family, do it for

807
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,721
everyone, do it for each other,

808
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,306
just do it, and win, guys!

809
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,557
>> Guys, for Yaxha.

810
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,309
One, two, three, Yaxha!

811
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,103
>> This immunity challenge is

812
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:16,645
really important because we

813
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,064
don't want to go to Tribal

814
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:19,981
Council.

815
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:20,899
We don't want to lose any more

816
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:21,817
of my members.

817
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,984
Do I look like I can kick

818
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,111
somebody's butt?

819
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,403
Hopefully, I'll be a star out

820
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:25,904
there.

821
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,863
Hopefully, I'll do something

822
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,948
that, you know, I won't be the

823
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:28,573
next one on the chopping block.

824
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,449
I don't want to be that way

825
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,118
again.

826
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:31,993
>> How do I look?

827
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:32,202
>> Ah!

828
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:32,702
I'm scared of you! Whoo!

829
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,121
>> You should be.

830
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,413
We're going to win.

831
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:35,997
I'm fired up, so I'm trying to

832
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,581
get people up, ready to go,

833
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,666
ready to win.

834
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,751
Right now in terms of people,

835
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,169
we're even, eight to eight.

836
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,170
So if we win tonight, we'll

837
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,296
still be down challenge-wise,

838
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,798
but we'll be up people-wise,

839
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,049
and that's where it's killer.

840
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,134
This is so crucial to keep the

841
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,470
numbers up on our side.

842
00:23:52,472 --> 00:24:14,744
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

843
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,789
All right, first things first.

844
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,875
Who has it?

845
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,625
You're tucking it away in there,

846
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,835
Judd.

847
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,337
>> That's right, man.

848
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,338
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

849
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,715
back up for grabs.

850
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,633
First of all, glad to see you

851
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,093
took the spirit of today's

852
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,553
challenge to heart and adorned

853
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,305
yourself as warriors.

854
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,389
Definitely plays into the

855
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,682
challenge.

856
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,100
Let's get to today's immunity

857
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,059
challenge.

858
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,436
It is based on the oldest and

859
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,229
the most popular of Maya games,

860
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,481
called court ball.

861
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,900
Playing on an elevated court,

862
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,360
you will square off three versus

863
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,362
three, attempting to score a

864
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,614
point for your tribe by tossing

865
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,282
this ball through one of your

866
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,825
two hoops.

867
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,161
This is a catch-and-pass game.

868
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,495
That means when you catch it,

869
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,663
you have to pass it.

870
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,748
You cannot run or walk with the

871
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,665
ball.

872
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,251
First tribe to score five points

873
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,670
wins.

874
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,671
Make sense?

875
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,756
At stake?

876
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,382
Well, when the Maya played, the

877
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,467
losing tribe sacrificed a

878
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:10,842
member.

879
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,344
You will do basically the same

880
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:12,928
thing tonight-- losers voting

881
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,764
somebody out at Tribal Council.

882
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,681
For each round, the teams of

883
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,683
three will be randomly drawn.

884
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,977
We're going to start with three

885
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:21,603
men versus three men and mix it

886
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,980
up from there.

887
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,148
Take a spot up on the platform,

888
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,816
and we'll get started.

889
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,074
Judd, Blake, Bobby Jon, taking

890
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,868
on Brian, Rafe and Jamie.

891
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,746
Prepare for battle.

892
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,708
Go!

893
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,709
Jamie first to the ball.

894
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,002
>> Let's go!

895
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:46,753
>> PROBST: Judd has it.

896
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,295
Blake open.

897
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,296
>> Blake, Blake, Blake!

898
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,297
>> PROBST: Blake tied up from

899
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,131
Jamie.

900
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:50,966
Judd has it.

901
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,384
Blocked by Jamie.

902
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,344
Bobby Jon has it.

903
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:54,844
Brian and Rafe have it.

904
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,264
Got to throw it.

905
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,265
Brian has it.

906
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:58,473
>> Yeah!

907
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,599
>> PROBST: Brian scores for

908
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,309
Yaxha!

909
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,603
Yaxha leads one-zero.

910
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,021
(<i> yelling</i> )

911
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,856
Now we're doing it like the Maya

912
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,649
did.

913
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,151
This round is two men, one

914
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:10,694
woman.

915
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,404
It's Judd and Blake with

916
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,490
Margaret taking on Rafe and

917
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,618
Jamie with Amy.

918
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,037
Go!

919
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,081
Amy takes one hard on the net.

920
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,291
Blake first to the ball.

921
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,583
Jamie has it, looking for

922
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,501
somebody to throw it to.

923
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,003
Loose ball.

924
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,962
Amy has it!

925
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,463
Amy fighting off Blake!

926
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,089
Trying to find somebody to pass

927
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:31,923
it to.

928
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:32,799
Blake steals it.

929
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,843
>> Good shot!

930
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,344
>> PROBST: Blake scores!

931
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:36,803
We're tied one-one.

932
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,680
>> There you go, Blake!

933
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,806
>> Nice shot, baby.

934
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,141
>> Amy moving a little slowly

935
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,351
after that round.

936
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,686
Next round is all women.

937
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,855
Cindy, Brooke and Danni taking

938
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,817
on Steph, Lydia and Brianna.

939
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,819
Go!

940
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,530
>> Come on, you guys!

941
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,031
>> PROBST: Steph and Danni

942
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,407
mixing it up.

943
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,450
Brianna has it.

944
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,659
>> Get her, get her, get her!

945
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,869
>> PROBST: Danni steals it!

946
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,121
>> Good job!

947
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,874

00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,939
once in my entire life.

1137
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:22,940
I was trying not to cry 'cause

1138
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:23,941
I wanted to hold all the water

1139
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:24,484
in.

1140
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,485
>> Steph, don't be mad at

1141
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:25,985
yourself.

1142
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,070
We got to keep positive, you

1143
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,072
know what I mean?

1144
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,281
>> I'm frustrated because we

1145
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,574
have Amy, she's got all the

1146
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,200
strength in the world, and she

1147
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,534
can't run.

1148
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,952
And we have Brianna who's a

1149
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:35,578
makeup artist.

1150
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,954
After the first round, she's

1151
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:37,789
like this-- her head's

1152
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,748
completely up her butt.

1153
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,041
I have to literally pull it out.

1154
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,542
I'm like, "Dude, it's too early

1155
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,710
in the game-- what are you

1156
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:42,960
doing?"

1157
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,003
Then we have a fish monger, who

1158
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,005
I do love dearly because she

1159
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,215
tries her best, but she's

1160
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,966
really not athletic at all.

1161
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,093
Part of me just wishes, like,

1162
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,678
why, why, just once can't I

1163
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,220
just be on a great tribe?

1164
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,180
I want to see her.

1165
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,891
Oh, my God, Amy.

1166
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:57,433
>> It's good, it's all good.

1167
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,143
I can feel it falling off.

1168
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,019
I love this!

1169
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,104
Snap, snap.

1170
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,064
>> Did you hear it snap?

1171
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,065
>> Oh, yeah, I snapped both

1172
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:04,774
sides.

1173
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,274
>> I rolled my ankle the

1174
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,026
first game I went out there.

1175
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,485
It's swollen, but it's

1176
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,404
definitely something I can live

1177
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,029
with.

1178
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,781
I'm not going to, you know,

1179
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,365
give up.

1180
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,324
I got to make sure my team

1181
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,244
knows I'm going to be all right.

1182
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,499
>> High-five, baby, gimme some.

1183
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,208
Don't worry. Hey...

1184
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,126
>> All right.

1185
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,335
>> And be honest with us, too.

1186
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,128
>> I'm fine.

1187
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,045
My ankle would have to be

1188
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,548
falling off before I ever quit.

1189
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,674
It might be a little painful,

1190
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,342
but it's going to be fine.

1191
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,010
>> Two of our girls don't

1192
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:33,302
have a clue.

1193
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,179
>> I explained what a pick was,

1194
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:35,638
and they didn't do it.

1195
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:36,222
>> Lydia has never played a

1196
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,140
sport in her life.

1197
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,350
Our team is totally down,

1198
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,560
because we got two people

1199
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,269
that never played a sport in

1200
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,187
their life in Lydia and Brianna.

1201
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,107
Amy sprained her ankle.

1202
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,442
With these challenges, if you

1203
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,776
had a sprained ankle, it would

1204
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,527
be tough, so, uh, that's

1205
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,990
big, 'cause we need to win.

1206
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,122
>> Jamie, you know I gave it my

1207
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:01,289
heart.

1208
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,332
>> I know, I saw you.

1209
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,377
You were out there hustling.

1210
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,465
>> She knows she's done.

1211
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,466
>> 'Cause I had a feeling it

1212
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,633
would have been a toss between

1213
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,634
me and her.

1214
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,635
>> We're going to Tribal Council

1215
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,179
tonight to vote Brianna out.

1216
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,472
She's done.

1217
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,639
Brianna's last day on

1218
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,183
<i>Survivor</i> is tonight.

1219
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,476
Day eight.

1220
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,227
Well, that girl makes me sick.

1221
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,729
She was leaning on a pole.

1222
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,773
Literally, leaning on a pole.

1223
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,857
You don't do that.

1224
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,900
There's three people out there,

1225
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,193
they're all busting ass.

1226
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,569
You know, they're all working

1227
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,278
hard and then, she's leaning

1228
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,112
against the pole.

1229
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,490
So there were only two people

1230
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,033
out there working so hard.

1231
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:37,950
She won't say anything to me

1232
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,076
because she knows I'll tell her

1233
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,786
right to her face.

1234
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,078
I'm going to vote her off.

1235
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:41,662
Everybody knew from day one, I

1236
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,121
don't like Brianna.

1237
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,206
She annoys me.

1238
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,082
Not my type of girl.

1239
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,627
I like them crazy and pretty.

1240
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,252
She's neither.

1241
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,213
>> Like you said, she probably

1242
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:50,671
knows herself, huh?

1243
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,340
>> She'll try to fight it,

1244
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,802
but there's nothing she can do.

1245
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,809
>> I love this game.

1246
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,810
Why would I be here if I didn't?

1247
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,644
>> Obviously.

1248
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,812
>> Why would I be here if I

1249
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,687
didn't think I could?

1250
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,814
>> Right.

1251
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,982
>> I'm here because I can.

1252
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:10,358
>> I know you can.

1253
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,276
>> I feel scared because the

1254
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,571
weak link today was probably me,

1255
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,698
and then I know Jamie and Lydia

1256
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,033
would have me out of here if

1257
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:19,450
they could.

1258
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,201
I'm voting for Lydia because

1259
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,621
when I talk to people, I look at

1260
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,372
them in the eyes.

1261
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:24,914
>> Right.

1262
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,041
>> I've never seen her eyes.

1263
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,042
She doesn't like me anyway.

1264
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,043
>> Lydia? Really?

1265
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:30,211
>> Mm.

1266
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,128
>> Why?

1267
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,421
>> I can tell.

1268
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,257
I told you I'm good at reading

1269
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,757
people.

1270
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,259
>> Yeah, you did tell me that.

1271
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,510
>> My vote tonight is based on

1272
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,220
who I can trust and who I've

1273
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,847
built relationships with, and I

1274
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,389
haven't built that bond with

1275
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,350
Lydia.

1276
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,227
>> Is that too tight?

1277
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,894
>> Let's go.

1278
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,980
>> Let's go.

1279
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,064
>> From now on, it's all

1280
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,649
about who's athletic or not.

1281
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,191
We can't lose anymore.

1282
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,276
You can have all the heart in

1283
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,319
the world, but if you can't

1284
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,779
hang, you're lost.

1285
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,405
There's no doubt out here right

1286
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,324
now athletic ability means the

1287
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,743
most.

1288
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,899
>> PROBST: Welcome back to

1289
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,066
Tribal Council.

1290
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,860
Steph, is it too early to ask if

1291
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,278
this is feeling a little

1292
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,405
familiar, a little deja vu?

1293
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,239
>> I'm having some horrible

1294
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,450
flashbacks, that's for sure,

1295
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,242
just that feeling again of

1296
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,870
losing, and having to come here,

1297
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,705
and having to get rid of another

1298
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,164
person.

1299
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,415
It makes me sick.

1300
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,333
>> PROBST: At today's immunity

1301
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,250
challenge, there were times

1302
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,293
where it seemed like you were

1303
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,461
looking around going, "Give me

1304
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,754
some help here."

1305
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,796
>> Yeah, I was completely

1306
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,964
frustrated today during the

1307
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,382
challenge, and, you know, I was

1308
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,634
out there with Lydia and

1309
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,801
Brianna, and, you know, they

1310
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,053
haven't really played sports,

1311
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,095
and they didn't know what a pick

1312
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,096
was, and it's frustrating but

1313
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,181
they were doing their best, and

1314
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,974
obviously our best was not good

1315
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,894
enough because we got beat.

1316
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,103
>> PROBST: Brianna, is it fair

1317
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,313
to come down on you because you

1318
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,564
didn't know what a pick was?

1319
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,107
>> I don't think anyone was

1320
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,609
coming down on me for not ever

1321
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,653
playing basketball and not

1322
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,154
knowing the terminology.

1323
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:21,989
I gave it my best, honestly, I

1324
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,116
did.

1325
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,700
>> PROBST: Lydia, I'll give it

1326
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,493
to you, you were trying.

1327
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,536
I don't know if you were much

1328
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,038
more effective than Brianna was.

1329
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:29,914
What do you think?

1330
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,458
>> Well, Jeff, I sucked today.

1331
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,126
But, you know, I was in there,

1332
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:34,627
and I was doing my best.

1333
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,837
Anything that would help the

1334
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,380
tribe, grabbing the ball,

1335
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,548
stealing from it, anything.

1336
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,383
And I just put my heart into it,

1337
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,510
and never gave up.

1338
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,303
>> PROBST: Brian, you think this

1339
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,138
tribe's out-matched?

1340
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,473
>> The other tribe is extremely

1341
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,849
athletic, perhaps more athletic

1342
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,892
than we are, but we have

1343
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:50,518
determination and will, and we

1344
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,062
really are not out-matched in

1345
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,188
how much we like each other.

1346
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:54,814
I can't imagine the other tribe

1347
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,441
being as unified as we are.

1348
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,734
>> PROBST: Let's talk about the

1349
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,735
wear and tear from today's

1350
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,027
challenge.

1351
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,404
Amy, I noticed when you came in,

1352
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,864
you were hobbling a little bit.

1353
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,949
>> When I first went out there,

1354
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:05,992
I just turned my ankle.

1355
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,868
But I didn't break it, so I'm

1356
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,037
good to go.

1357
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:10,621
>> PROBST: Gary, when you see

1358
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,373
some of these injuries, does it

1359
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,666
go through your head, you know,

1360
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,251
we got to keep the strong, got

1361
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,377
to get rid of the weak?

1362
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,545
>> Well, we're definitely at a

1363
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,587
point right now, Jeff, that

1364
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,423
athleticism is big.

1365
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,425
The reality is, if you can't

1366
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,884
help us in the challenges, it's

1367
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,302
going to hurt us as a team and

1368
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,430
we're not going to get anywhere.

1369
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,973
>> PROBST: Amy, you come in

1370
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:29,432
here, you're injured.

1371
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,642
All we talked about tonight is

1372
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,393
physical, physical, physical.

1373
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,895
How frustrating would it be to

1374
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,980
go out number three?

1375
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,273
>> It would be frustrating

1376
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,399
because it would have to be

1377
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,775
because they think I'm injured,

1378
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,901
but it's not that serious.

1379
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:45,406
So don't make the mistake.

1380
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,199
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1381
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:47,950
vote.

1382
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,120
Lydia, you're up.

1383
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,427
>> Lydia, you have not once

1384
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,304
looked me in the eye when I've

1385
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,097
spoken to you or even attempted

1386
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,600
at conversing.

1387
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,610
>> You're a girlie-girl, you

1388
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,779
need to go back to the shopping

1389
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,948
mall when you leave the jungle.

1390
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,212
>> I have to do what's right for

1391
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,838
this tribe right now.

1392
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,173
We've got to win immunity.

1393
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,175
I can't be on the losing streak

1394
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,135
anymore.

1395
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,181
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1396
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,557
votes.

1397
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,902
Once the votes are read, the

1398
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:05,694
decision is final.

1399
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,113
The person voted out will be

1400
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,364
asked to leave the Tribal

1401
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,657
Council area immediately.

1402
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,576
I'll read the votes.

1403
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,453
First vote.

1404
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,872
Brianna.

1405
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,462
Lydia.

1406
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,297
Brianna.

1407
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,465
Two votes Brianna, one vote

1408
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:30,511
Lydia.

1409
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:30,719
Brianna.

1410
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,556
That's three for Brianna.

1411
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,810
Brianna.

1412
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,938
Four votes Brianna.

1413
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,275
Third person voted out of

1414
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,276
<i>Survivor: Guatemala...</i>

1415
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,694
Brianna. That's five.

1416
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,570
That's enough.

1417
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,698
You need to bring me your torch.

1418
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,625
Brianna, the tribe has spoken.

1419
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,878
It's time for you to go.

1420
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,171
>> You guys are strong.

1421
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,547
Kick some Nakum butt.

1422
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,548
>> Brianna, sweetheart.

1423
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,801
>> See ya, Bri.

1424
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:19,518
>> PROBST: Well, we're only

1425
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,644
eight days in, but when it comes

1426
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,855
to Tribal Council, your strategy

1427
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,315
seems clear: keep the strong,

1428
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,359
vote out the weak.

1429
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,485
But in a game this

1430
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,154
unpredictable, voting based

1431
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:30,779
solely on physical strength can

1432
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,865
be risky.

1433
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,408
See how it plays out.

1434
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:35,284
Grab your torches.

1435
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,285
Head on back to camp.

1436
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,287
Good night.

>> It is survival of the fittest

1458
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,539
out there.

1459
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,624
And I was the weakest link.

1460
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,793
You've got to be athletic to be

1461
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,752
out here, and I gave it my all,

1462
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,921
I tried my hardest.

1463
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,923
I am an athletic person but not

1464
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,758
as athletic as these people.

1465
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,176
These are strong people.

1466
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,719
I was only here for eight days

1467
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,720
but it was the best eight days

1468
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,721
of my life.

1469
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,723
The toughest but the best.
