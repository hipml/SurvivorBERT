1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:02,085
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously, on

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,546
<i>Survivor...</i>
The Morgan Tribe continued

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,715
to struggle.
>> It's very hard

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,383
to not be able to sleep.
It's very hard

5
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,927
to freeze every night.
>> PROBST: At the first reward

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,722
challenge, the tribes learned
that a treasure was buried

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,432
on each of their islands.
You want to know what

8
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,058
you're playing for?
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,393
>> PROBST: First clue:
piece of the map

10
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,145
that will lead you
to your treasure chest.

11
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,939
The winning tribe
will also get to loot one item

12
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,983
one item from
the other tribe's camp.

13
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,735
Go!
During the challenge,

14
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,945
skinny Ryan's struggle
caused the Morgans

15
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:31,614
to fall behind.
Drake wins the reward!

16
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,783
>> One, two, three...
Drake!

17
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,244
>> PROBST: Sandra was chosen by
her tribe to loot the Morgan

18
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,037
camp.
>> I want that tarp.

19
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,789
I got to do what I got to do,
right?

20
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,791
That whole tribe is a bunch of
(bleep).

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,626
>> PROBST: The Morgan Tribe
was devastated, and Osten

22
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,629
contemplated quitting.
>> Do I sleep out in the cold

23
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,798
just until I get pneumonia?
>> If you're gone, we got no

24
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,593
hope.
>> PROBST: At the immunity

25
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,429
challenge, the underdog Morgans
took an early lead.

26
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,848
>> Here we go!
>> PROBST: But in the end...

27
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:00,101
Drake wins immunity!
...having had enough,

28
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,313
Osten wanted to be voted out.
>> When it comes down to it,

29
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,273
it's mental.
I was personally upset

30
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,358
and disappointed
with Osten for quitting.

31
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,194
>> PROBST: But at Tribal
Council...

32
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,154
Second member voted out
of the Morgan Tribe.

33
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,490
...the Morgans decided to keep
Osten for his strength

34
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,160
and voted skinny Ryan out
of the Pearl Islands.

35
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,206
Fourteen are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

36
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,747
>> We only have six
tribe mates left.

37
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,917
I keep looking around
for, uh, two more.

38
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,588
It's kind of strange.
Morale is low.

39
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:56,009
We need a victory,
any kind of victory.

40
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,225
>> We need to stay in this,
Lord.

41
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:09,606
Help us strive.
Give us strength.

42
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,984
I'm praying
to give us strength.

43
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,612
Maybe I'm praying for something
so personal--

44
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:24,412
my husband, my troop,
my new friend Ryan.

45
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,333
Tribal Council was difficult
because I lost, it felt like,

46
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:33,254
my best friend in the tribe.
And I did vote for Osten

47
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:38,927
after some conversation
that... yeah, he quit.

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,429
He's the one that
didn't have the heart.

49
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,599
So what I'm doing is
I'm just staying in here

50
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,352
as long as I can.
I'm just going to show

51
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,980
that I'm worthy to stay here--
maybe above, uh, Darrah.

52
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,151
She's sitting underneath
the shelter right now.

53
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,488
>> You don't think Darrah's
strong in challenges?

54
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,990
>> She's 102 pounds.
>> I know, but...

55
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,327
no, I mean, in terms of
endurance, stamina?

56
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,248
>> No stronger than me.
>> Fair enough. I'm just asking.

57
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,961
>> Well, I do appreciate
Osten understanding

58
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,213
that I just couldn't
vote Ryan out.

59
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,799
But see, that's...
that's the other thing, he quit.

60
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:21,844
He didn't... he didn't quit.
He said he was interested

61
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,514
in quitting, and I think
there's a big difference

62
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,016
between quitting and pulling the
trigger and actually quitting.

63
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,352
You know, there was one point,
uh, that Osten threw in the

64
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,854
towel and said that he
wanted to leave.

65
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,691
But my concern is that,
from a physical standpoint,

66
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,194
he's somewhat anchoring
our tribe.

67
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:41,197
>> We're not winning
challenges right now.

68
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,491
We're not winning
immunity challenges,

69
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,828
we're not winning anything.
It gets you down a little bit,

70
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,372
but, you know, just got to pick
it up, just use that as extra

71
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,208
motivation.
You know, I sat back,

72
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,086
said a prayer to the good man
upstairs and, uh...

73
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,880
I'm not going to quit.
You know, would I like to be

74
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,716
sitting at home right now
eating about three

75
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,093
double cheeseburgers?
Absolutely.

76
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,555
But... I'm not right now.
>> We got to get O.T.

77
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,559
fired up for this challenge.
He's got to get fired up

78
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,936
like the first one.
He was a madman.

79
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,272
He could have lifted
that cannon himself.

80
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,108
Every tribe mate has an
obligation to the tribe

81
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,527
that you have to check, you
know, your mental infirmities

82
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,030
at the door, get rid of those,
and just suck it up

83
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,241
and do what you need to do.
Really, for Osten, the key is

84
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,910
mental stability and it's...
it's something he's going

85
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,788
to struggle with
his entire time out here.

86
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,790
So, I'm just going to do
everything I can to help the guy

87
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,169
out, to get him back to that...
that awesome, larger-than-life

88
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:42,133
individual he was
when he set foot on this beach.

89
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,683
>> Everyone think we should go
look for the treasure in the

90
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,268
boat?
>> Yeah, I'd love to find

91
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,270
the treasure.
If it's got good, good,

92
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,565
goodies in it, like booze,
a big bottle of rum.

93
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,610
(chuckles)
>> After winning

94
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,529
the first reward challenge,
we got the first third

95
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,990
of our treasure map.
We'll be heading east,

96
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,993
that way.
It said, "If you go

97
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,496
when the time is right"--
and the only way time

98
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,956
really affects things
around here is tide--

99
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,250
so, it must mean something you
can only get to during low tide

100
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:24,967
or see during low tide.
>> So, we took out the boat--

101
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,011
we decided to go and look
for big landmarks--

102
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,139
and we went around for...
I don't know how long

103
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,475
we were out for.
And it was hard because

104
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,311
the more we were searching,
the more possibilities

105
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:39,774
we were coming up with.
>> I want to find

106
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:44,112
that treasure so bad.
What about right here?

107
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,823
It just eats me up
that there's a treasure

108
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,158
out there
that could have warm clothes

109
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,620
or junk food or potato chips
or, I don't know,

110
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,831
something in there.
>> What about...

111
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,332
is there something around
this way, too?

112
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,793
>> There's probably more sand
around this way.

113
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,170
We're baffled right now.
We've been searching

114
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,339
and searching
and haven't found the treasure

115
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,217
yet, but we'll find it.
It's going to take almost all of

116
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,011
us to dig in this one part.
>> I know.

117
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,888
>> Our tribe went out
half-cocked.

118
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,849
I played into that
for awhile, too, until I

119
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,686
started thinking about it.
Pirates were not idiots and

120
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,855
people are not idiots.
And you don't bury things in

121
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,567
the sand that you don't want
to be washed back up.

122
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,402
>> You guys just want us
to dig up the whole island?

123
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,321
>> Sounds like it's about it.
Kind of got a little discouraged

124
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,074
and decided to, um, take a
break and check another time,

125
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,202
and hopefully get another
piece of the map today,

126
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:40,710
so we can get that next clue.
>> Tree mail.

127
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,880
>> Tree mail, tree mail, tree
mail!

128
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,716
"Ever get that sinking feeling
that you just can't stay

129
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,927
afloat?
Is it the fault of a lazy crew

130
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,222
or a problem with your boat?
Should you bail out of

131
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,893
trouble, or steer the other way,
Will you get a good night's

132
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,438
sleep, will your possessions
go away?"

133
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,690
>> If we screw up on this one,
they're gonna come

134
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,859
and take whatever.
>> Steal something else.

135
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,361
>> Right now, we need this win,
I think, more than anything.

136
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,114
When we read the tree mail,
it was a reward for some

137
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,783
sleeping material.
So, I'm assuming, like, blankets

138
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,703
and pillows and stuff like that.
And then, we get to raid

139
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,122
the other tribe's camp.
>> I want is some clothes.

140
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,917
>> Oh, clothes? Yeah, child.
>> A blanket.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,752
>> If I have to be as cold
as it was last night--

142
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,130
I was freezing.
>> Well, we alternated

143
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,090
in thinking about
is who's going to sit out.

144
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,760
>> If it... if it's physical,
I'll sit out this one.

145
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,887
If it's not, I won't.
We're heading

146
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,556
into a reward challenge,
so we have to think about who

147
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,267
we're going to sit out,
because we are getting the

148
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,561
advantage over the Morgan Tribe
and we will have to sit out,

149
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,605
you know, two people.
If it happens to be

150
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,482
a swimming challenge,
Sandra's not the best

151
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,150
swimmer in the world.
Sandra wouldn't be a bad one

152
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,611
to do today,
because the immunity

153
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,613
could have swimming.
>> So what makes you

154
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,573
a better swimmer than me?
>> I'm not saying

155
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,116
that you can't swim!
I'm just saying we want...

156
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,286
>> The day we jumped off the
boat, where were you

157
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,082
when I was already onshore?
Still in the damn water.

158
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,668
I said, "When we jumped off
the boat the very first day,

159
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,462
I had already landed on shore."
He was still out there

160
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,298
doggy paddling.
So, he's weaker than I am.

161
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,550
But he gets mad.
He doesn't want to seem like

162
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,469
he's the weakest one out here,
which he is.

163
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,596
>> Okay, like, when we
were swimming to shore,

164
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,640
I had her glasses
in my sock, I couldn't

165
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,476
kick my legs,
so I swam with just my arms,

166
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,020
and how much did you beat me by,
using your entire body to swim

167
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,022
and me just using my arms?
>> What day? What day?

168
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,567
>> Day one! Day one!
Swimming from the boat,

169
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,318
you beat me by so bad.
How much did you beat me by?

170
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,569
>> Swimming to the boat?
What are you talking about?

171
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,530
>> Swimming from the boat, when
we jumped off the (clang) boat

172
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,449
and we went to the shore.
If you beat me so (clang) bad

173
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,286
and I just used my arms,
how bad did you beat me?

174
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,454
>> You know what?
I can get loud, too!

175
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,665
What the ...
I can get loud, too!

176
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,166
>> I don't want to (clang)
argue with you.

177
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,502
That's why I'm (clang) from you.
You're the one who wants

178
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,504
to fight.
I walked away because she could

179
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:51,132
argue all day long.
That's because she's foolish.

180
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,884
>> I can have a bigger mouth.
>> Good, have the (clang) last

181
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,178
word!
That's all you (clang) want.

182
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,514
>> Well, then, be quiet,
so that I can finish it.

183
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:02,518
Screw Jon, 'cause he's an ass.
Everything that comes out

184
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,771
of his mouth is just ridiculous.
>> Her days are numbered.

185
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,357
We have bigger threats to get
rid of first, but she's not one

186
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,486
of the final four.
So... And I, and I got a mil

187
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,824
that says she won't be
the final one.

188
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,084
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.
Okay, you guys ready

189
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,962
for the challenge?
>> Yes.

190
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,089
>> PROBST: For today's reward
challenge, you will battle the

191
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,885
opposing tribe from separate
boats.

192
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,887
There will be two boats
for each tribe,

193
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,890
three people in each boat.
Your goal: sink both

194
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,560
of the other tribe's boats.
Each boat will have eight holes.

195
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,063
Those holes are plugged
with corks.

196
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,732
Using your grappling hook,
get ahold of that cork

197
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,860
and pull it out of the boat,
causing the boat to sink.

198
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,862
You can also use it
to grab the boat

199
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,697
and bring it closer to you.
You can also use it

200
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,200
to push down on that other boat
and try and sink it.

201
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,410
The bucket can be used
for bailing water

202
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,245
out of your own boat.
You can also use it to put water

203
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,873
onto the other boat.
Want to know

204
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,919
what you're playing for?
>> Yeah!

205
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:14,090
>> Whoa!
>> Oh.

206
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,425
>> PROBST: You got a mattress,
you got four pillows,

207
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,970
and you have four blankets.
In addition, another piece

208
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,891
of the puzzle to finding your
buried treasure.

209
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,394
For Drake, it'll be
your second piece.

210
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,646
Morgan, it would your first.
And the fun part

211
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,107
of reward challenge
is the winning tribe

212
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,651
gets to loot one item from
the losing tribe.

213
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,820
Drake, because you have
two extra members,

214
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,780
you're sitting two people out,
keeping in mind you cannot

215
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,825
sit out the same people
in back-to-back challenges.

216
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:48,290
Who's it going to be?
Jon, Michelle, sitting out.

217
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,294
Everybody else, swim out,
wait for my "Go."

218
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,012
Here we go, guys.
Last boat floating

219
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:06,475
wins reward for their tribe.
Survivors ready?

220
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:13,232
Go!
Drake making

221
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:18,821
a beeline for Morgan.
Shawn and Osten battling.

222
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,992
Lill throwing some water.
Christa throwing some water.

223
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:30,499
Osten almost out, but hangs on.
Trish pulls the first cork

224
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:38,174
from the Morgan Tribe.
Osten pulls a cork

225
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:45,806
from Rupert's boat.
All boats are taking on water.

226
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:55,983
Darrah doing damage to Drake
with her bucket, soaking Rupert.

227
00:12:56,066 --> 00:13:01,030
Drake taking on a lot of water.
(shouting)

228
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,699
Osten's boat
has moved away from the action.

229
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:10,915
>> Get over here!
>> PROBST: Rupert using brute

230
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:16,170
strength against Morgan.
(shouting)

231
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,715
Osten's boat
taking on a lot of water.

232
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:24,512
Osten, you're
sinking your own boat.

233
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:30,726
You need to bail.
Morgan's boat is down.

234
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,021
Osten, Lill, Tijuana,
you're out.

235
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,191
Morgan down to one boat,
getting double-teamed.

236
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,985
You guys need to get
out of there.

237
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,905
Get out of there.
Ryan trying to get

238
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:48,035
some force on Drake's boat.
Rupert putting the hammer down

239
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:54,333
on Morgan.
Morgan taking on a lot of water.

240
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,758
Drake wins their fourth
challenge in a row.

241
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,720
Wins reward.
(cheering)

242
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,605
All right, Drake--
your mattress,

243
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,150
four blankets, four pillows,
will be delivered to camp.

244
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,278
We'll do the looting
tomorrow morning.

245
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,488
Morgan, expect
another visit from Drake,

246
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:34,582
and we're gonna take one item.
>> Yeah, we just got

247
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:51,473
and we're gonna take one item.
>> Yeah, we just got

248
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,518
our ass kicked again.
It takes all the fun away.

249
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,980
It's just demoralizing.
God. How can you not

250
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,316
take it personally?
How can you

251
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,152
not let it affect you?
Well, we just came back from

252
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,488
our second reward challenge.
We lost miserably.

253
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,992
All-time low, the Morgan Tribe.
They won, they get the bed,

254
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,827
they get the pillows
and the blankets

255
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,871
and that's something
that strikes so near

256
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,123
and dear to our hearts,
because the only thing

257
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,709
we ever complain about
is the, uh, sleeping,

258
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,838
um, facility.
>> So, why do you think we're

259
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,341
getting our ass kicked?
>> I think a couple

260
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,343
of their players
were stronger than

261
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,845
a couple of our players.
>> In every situation?

262
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:32,681
>> No, not in every situation,
but Rupert has killed us.

263
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,017
We had as many plugs out
as they did.

264
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,479
Rupert was stronger.
Right now, the problem

265
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,358
with the Morgan Tribe
is we're doubting ourselves.

266
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,653
We're doubting whether
we can actually win.

267
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,488
Osten's on the fence.
I don't... I don't know

268
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,740
if he has the confidence.
He definitely doesn't have the

269
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,534
confidence he had in day three.
All's you need

270
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,870
is something to roll,
like, just something

271
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,206
to start you off.
Like, for instance, like,

272
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,916
when a tugboat
pulls out those big ships,

273
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,460
it just needs something
to get it started.

274
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,879
>> I think we're doing fine.
>> So do I.

275
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,214
>> There's a couple
of things I think...

276
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,091
Like, I want to go
fishing in the morning.

277
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,718
Do I know anything
about fishing? No.

278
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:19,812
But am I going to try it? Yes.
>> What are you smiling

279
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:28,737
But am I going to try it? Yes.
>> What are you smiling

280
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,074
about, sleepy head?
You'd get fired,

281
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,451
if you were working for me.
>> Where's Lill?

282
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,912
>> Oh, I don't know.
She went by herself fishing.

283
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:40,582
This needs to stop, guys.
She just... people just

284
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,876
going off
in different directions.

285
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,921
A little bit ago,
Lill went fishing by herself.

286
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,257
I think we need to be
more of a team

287
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,051
and we're still doing this
separatist stuff

288
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,762
and I'm... I'm tired of it.
It's nothing against her,

289
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,391
it's just, here we are again,
spreading out.

290
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,732
>> I decided last night--
we need some food.

291
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,485
The rice had sand in it.
I can't even swallow that

292
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,572
without throwing up.
So, I told the guys

293
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,283
I was gonna go fishing,
and they said,

294
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,703
"Well, you need two people."
Well, they still are in bed.

295
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,622
Okay, God,
I need some help here.

296
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:31,091
(Jaws-like theme playing)
(gasps)

297
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:36,305
Oh, my God.
I just lost the hook.

298
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:42,311
Oh, I'm gone for good now.
I think we started

299
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,106
with three or four hooks.
We're down to one.

300
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,150
There was
a blowfish in the water--

301
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,361
which I know you can't eat--
and they're the ones

302
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:56,158
that kept taking my bait.
And then I lost the hook.

303
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,371
>> How we doing?
>> Great on blowfish.

304
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:06,126
They love me.
I gave them breakfast.

305
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,296
>> Nothing else?
>> Nothing. I couldn't

306
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:15,010
even see anything else.
And I lost the hook.

307
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:21,308
>> Seriously.
You lost it on the rocks

308
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:25,145
or something?
>> No, they just took it.

309
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,357
I had the fisherman,
uh, knot on there,

310
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,653
and it was strong.
>> I'm shocked, actually.

311
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,823
I'm a deer in headlights because
she's a Boy Scout troop master

312
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,033
and she knows
many different knots,

313
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:41,328
including the fisherman's knot.
The only way you lose

314
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,914
a hook like that is two ways:
either the line breaks,

315
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,042
which it didn't,
or your knot wasn't secure,

316
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,546
which it wasn't.
I don't know, man.

317
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,382
We got to... We got to have
a talk with Lill, I guess.

318
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,051
She's just not...
>> She's not accepting of

319
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,720
any talks, you know that.
>> Well, hey, she's gonna

320
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,057
have to accept something.
I'm pissed.

321
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,184
She's being
a little bit impatient

322
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,395
about the whole issue
of going fishing.

323
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,188
If she waited
just that little bit,

324
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,565
I would have been able
to go with her,

325
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,191
but next thing you know,
she's gone,

326
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,111
and I wasn't
too happy about it.

327
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,239
>> If we lose the next
go-around, it's either me or

328
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,410
Darrah.
So, I was hoping that I

329
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:26,206
could, you know, just shine
a little bit here.

330
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,095
>> Oh. See?
See? We're going

331
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,389
around the island.
That's all the rocky stuff.

332
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,600
Just need one more map.
>> Yeah, he only said

333
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,602
there were three.
Anyone want to go

334
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,395
for a quick treasure hunt?
>> Last night, it was decided

335
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,105
that the treasure hunt
was the last thing on

336
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,815
our list of things to do.
We should do everything

337
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,525
else before that.
>> Yeah, but we got

338
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,236
everything else done.
>> Hey, you guys,

339
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,906
pillage the village?
Hello?

340
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,617
>> Hello.
>> Am I going?

341
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,453
>> To pillage?
Yeah, oh, yeah.

342
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,456
>> I was chosen among our...
our tribe here

343
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,459
to go loot the other tribe,
as part of our reward

344
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,211
for winning the challenge
the other day.

345
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,464
Just take what you have
to take and then just leave.

346
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,965
>> Don't tell them
anything about us,

347
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,634
and try to find out
all the dirt on them.

348
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,636
>> The last time,
Sandra came back and reported

349
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,138
that they had one water pot
for all their food

350
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:26,183
and all their water.
So, group decision,

351
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,686
we're taking their water pot.
But if they only have one pot,

352
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,480
you guys, how are they
going to boil water?

353
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,689
>> I know. How are
they going to live?

354
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,108
>> How would you
boil water, Burton,

355
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,694
and survive without a pot?
>> Because, if they come to us

356
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,322
and take ours, we're screwed.
But if we have two then,

357
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,990
they can take one back
and we're not so screwed.

358
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,825
>> Just like we have two tarps
now, they take one...

359
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,577
>> Water is a little
different than a tarp.

360
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,162
>> You have to have
water to live.

361
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,289
>> Really, we're taking
away their life.

362
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,667
>> If their pot is the only
water cleaning source they have,

363
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,003
my God, I feel terrible
about taking it.

364
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,631
But I have to remind myself,
we are pirates

365
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:02,511
and this is our game.
And Drake is the power

366
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:09,184
to be reckoned with.
>> They would do the same to us,

367
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,852
if they could.
>> Absolutely will.

368
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:24,324
>> They hate us.
>> Right now, I'm making a,

369
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,868
uh... or trying to make a
dragnet, maybe to catch some

370
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,621
fish. I got to become
MacGyver out here

371
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:34,668
to be able to survive, I guess.
>> Won't they take it?

372
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,713
What if we just bunch it back up
like a useless net

373
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,717
and stick it in the dinghy?
>> Okay.

374
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,052
>> Not a good morning.
One of the, uh, infamous Drake

375
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,514
tribe members is coming over
to loot our camp to take one

376
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:51,018
of our prized possessions.
We don't have

377
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,229
a whole lot right now.
>> They can't take

378
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,106
our canteens, right?
>> No.

379
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,859
>> No, I don't think
they can take all of them.

380
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:02,279
>> The two boiling pots
are in a strategic area.

381
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,740
The one thing
that I hope we don't lose

382
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,118
is the silver pan, because
we need it to boil water in.

383
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,370
But it's got
some really, really nasty,

384
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,415
uh, blanket in it right now
that's been cooking for a while,

385
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,418
so, you know, let them,
uh, take the thing hot.

386
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:22,090
I don't care. Burn their hands.
(chuckles)

387
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,430
Is there a boat coming?
>> Who is it?

388
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,266
>> It's Drake.
Looks like the blonde chick.

389
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,935
>> The tall blonde?
>> It's all right.

390
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,438
It's all right. How are you?
What's your name?

391
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,106
>> Christa.
>> Christa, I'm Tijuana.

392
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,276
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations again.

393
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,488
Come on to our humble abode.
This is Christa, guys.

394
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,115
>> Hey, I'm Andrew, by the way.
We haven't formally met.

395
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,618
Good to meet you
after all this time.

396
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,620
>> After all this time.
Everything good?

397
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,622
>> Everything's good.
>> Good night's sleep?

398
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,665
>> I bet, with those
pillows and blankets.

399
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,250
>> Did everyone fit on...?
>> No, nobody could fit all

400
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,628
on the mattress.
>> I use my buff, and I roll

401
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,839
it up for my pillow at night.
(Christa laughing)

402
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,467
>> You guys, I hate to,
you know, cut it short.

403
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,429
I'm going to take the...
your big old pot behind you.

404
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,389
>> It's hot.
>> Yeah, watch your fingers,

405
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,016
that's very hot.
>> Thank God they had another

406
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,645
pot. Thank God.
I would've felt horrible.

407
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,647
I don't even think I could have
looked at any of them

408
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,691
in the eyes when I left.
>> They don't have any pots?

409
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,444
>> I don't know.
>> It's really cool

410
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,948
in your tribe, pretty much?
or you got some...?

411
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,616
>> Yeah, yeah. Everybody's
getting along.

412
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,953
>> So, who's the leader?
Do you, have a...

413
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,955
did you designate a...?
>> Uh, nobody.

414
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,998
Everybody just kicks back.
It's just the strangest thing.

415
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,252
It was just really hard
because I was just put

416
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,629
so on the spot.
I felt so under pressure--

417
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,673
everybody was trying to hammer
me with questions,

418
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,134
and I was just trying to think
of the right thing to say.

419
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,844
>> The first immunity challenge
you lose, who do you think's

420
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,138
gone in your tribe?
>> I have no idea.

421
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,014
Well, that's the funny part...
>> Come on.

422
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,683
>> No, I really don't.
I really don't.

423
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,351
>> I mean, it doesn't matter
if we know because we're not

424
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,853
in your tribe.
>> I know.

425
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,022
I don't know, you guys.
I didn't tell them anything.

426
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,733
At least I was trying
not to tell them anything,

427
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,819
and it was just really hard.
It was overwhelming.

428
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,195
It was overwhelming.
I just wanted

429
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,822
to get out of there.
I just wanted to get

430
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,532
out of there.
You guys, it's been a pleasure.

431
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,701
I'm sorry.
Give me a hug, you guys.

432
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,536
>> It was nice meeting
you; you're sweet.

433
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,580
>> All right, you guys.
>> Bye.

434
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,540
>> Later on, Ryan.
Later on, Darrah.

435
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,792
>> I asked her,
if they lose immunity,

436
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,212
who gets voted out?
Said she has no idea.

437
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,548
>> She's lying.
Just think about it.

438
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,508
The girl's trying to be crafty.
She ain't as dumb and dorky

439
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,719
as she's trying to play off.
Her Big Bird-type personality

440
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,054
she's trying to portray
on us is ridiculous.

441
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,015
It's a farce,
it's a phony.

442
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,392
>> I think, right now,
the Morgan Tribe, mentally,

443
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,519
is probably stronger
than the Drake Tribe,

444
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,563
because we have experienced
so much defeat.

445
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,231
You know, they've probably
been sleeping better than us,

446
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,108
probably have the same
amount of water.

447
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,485
They definitely have the same
amount of bug bites.

448
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,530
But they have this euphoria, the
adrenaline that naturally

449
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,408
results from winning,
and that's huge out here.

450
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,911
We haven't had that yet.
So I can't wait for Drake

451
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,664
to suffer some defeat
and see if they just crumble.

452
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:22,896
>> Oh, baby. Oh, baby.
This looks like a compass.

453
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,107
We got mail, guys.
Here's our flag.

454
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,985
>> How cool.
That's awesome.

455
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,572
Look at that thing.
>> "Your flag holds tribe pride,

456
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:37,118
never let it fall.
Select a friend to represent,

457
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,163
choose the one most small.
You must also

458
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,583
choose your strongest,
on their shoulders

459
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,127
your fate will rest.
'Pure Will'

460
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,464
in a game of fortitude,
defines this final test."

461
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,926
>> We just got some, uh,
tree mail.

462
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,012
It indicated we should select
our smallest and our strongest.

463
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,641
You the strongest?
>> I hope so, yeah.

464
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,352
>> I agree.
>> Yeah.

465
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:06,022
>> Osten has struggled
a little bit, uh,

466
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,275
psychologically in the last
couple of days.

467
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,819
He clearly has the physical
strength, but he also has to

468
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,487
have the focus and the mental
toughness.

469
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,823
Not to put any pressure on you,
so our entire fate

470
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,492
is on your shoulders.
>> Play it, don't say it.

471
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,452
>> All right.
It says to choose your smallest.

472
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,832
You're the smallest, right?
>> I guess.

473
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,918
We need to win this challenge
today bad, because going

474
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,671
to Tribal Council is not fun,
and, you know, who wants

475
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,215
to vote off a member of your
own tribe, you know?

476
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,718
And now we have six
and they have eight.

477
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,512
Sounds like a two-man show.
>> We're down four.

478
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,849
Four challenges we've lost.
We go to another Tribal Council,

479
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:49,691
we're finished.
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

480
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,737
I like the tribe flags.
Looking good.

481
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,655
You'll be bringing those
with you to challenges.

482
00:26:55,739 --> 00:27:01,036
Okay, first things first.
Thank you, Shawn.

483
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,540
Immunity back up for grabs.
We talk a lot about

484
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:09,711
pulling your own weight
in this game<i> Survivor.</i>

485
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,713
Today's challenge
is going to put that notion

486
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,050
to the test literally.
Dangling over the water are

487
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,053
your two smallest tribe mates--
Michelle for Drake,

488
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,722
Darrah for Morgan.
The rest of you are going

489
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,391
to hold them up,
using a rope and pulley system.

490
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,852
The two tribe mates that
you chose as your strongest--

491
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,021
Rupert for Drake,
Osten for Morgan--

492
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,065
are going to be your anchors
at the back.

493
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,192
And, every five minutes,
a tribe mate at the front

494
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,027
will let go of the rope,
which will put more weight

495
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,072
on the people in the back until
only Rupert and Osten remain.

496
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,407
At that point,
it becomes a showdown between

497
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,911
these final two tribe members.
For the losers,

498
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,455
a trip to Tribal Council,
a lot at stake.

499
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,042
Drake, you sat out Jon and
Michelle in the last challenge.

500
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,087
Who are you sitting out today?
Burton and Trish.

501
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,588
All right.
Everybody gear up,

502
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:58,551
wait for my "Go."
Here we go, for immunity.

503
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:04,766
Survivors ready?
Unhook.

504
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:13,441
Go!
You guys doing all right?

505
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:21,241
First five minutes.
Jon, Lill, let go of the ropes.

506
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:25,453
Take a spot back on your mats.
And then there were four.

507
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,289
How you doing, Sandra?
>> Couldn't be any better.

508
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,958
>> PROBST: You got another five
minutes in you, right?

509
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:37,632
>> Six, if I have to.
>> PROBST: Okay, we've reached

510
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,260
another five minutes.
Tijuana, Sandra,

511
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:44,514
let go of the rope now.
You guys need to take

512
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:50,437
as much of this off
of these final two as you can.

513
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,359
Five more minutes have elapsed.
Christa, Andrew,

514
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,320
let go of the rope now.
Ryno, gonna have to do

515
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,782
some work now.
Shawn having to do some work.

516
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,951
Michelle, tell me
how you're feeling.

517
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,829
So-so? What's hurting?
The legs?

518
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,457
>> I can't even feel my legs.
>> PROBST: Darrah, how are your

519
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,167
legs?
>> Numb.

520
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,835
>> PROBST: You want them to let
you go?

521
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:21,301
>> No.
>> PROBST: Another five minutes

522
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,971
have elapsed.
Shawn, Ryno, let go now.

523
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,808
This is it,
down to the big men.

524
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:35,106
Remember, guys, we're going to
make this harder as we go along.

525
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,819
Michelle does not look
comfortable right now.

526
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,030
>> Looking good, baby,
looking good!

527
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,032
>> That's it, Darrah.
>> Hang in there, Darrah.

528
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,243
>> Good job, Darrah!
>> Whoo!

529
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,380
>> PROBST: You guys feeling the
bugs crawling around you,

530
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,966
coming out of the sand?
>> There's no bugs.

531
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,260
>> PROBST: Or is the pain
overriding that?

532
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,847
>> We sleep in bugs.
We love crabs

533
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:17,690
on our head at night.
>> PROBST: Let me throw out a

534
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:22,487
notion-- What are the odds that
Darrah or Michelle will quit?

535
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,365
Do you have any idea
how much pain they're in?

536
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,158
Someone will quit.
One of you two

537
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:36,960
or one of those two will quit.
All right, guys,

538
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,420
you've reached 90 minutes.
The rest of the challenge is now

539
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,173
going to play out on your feet,
so go ahead

540
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,384
and transition to your feet.
(rope creaks)

541
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:50,265
Down to the nitty-gritty now.
Osten's struggling to hang on.

542
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,560
Rupert is using his midsection.
Michelle and Darrah

543
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,311
are doing their best
to keep some circulation

544
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,606
in their body.
Rupert's showing some signs

545
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,150
of struggle.
>> Uh-oh. Be careful.

546
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,653
>> PROBST: Michelle dropping a
little bit.

547
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,822
Rupert trying to find a new
spot.

548
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:12,412
Nothing comfortable.
Everything hurts.

549
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:37,520
You guys are at two hours.
Gonna move to the last phase.

550
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,231
There will be no leaning against
the hitching post with your body

551
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,109
and no wrapping the rope
around the hitching post.

552
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,321
It's going to be on your feet,
back, rope in your hands.

553
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,033
It's coming down to pure
body strength and will.

554
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:59,167
Five, four, three, two, one.
Get it off, off, off.

555
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,837
Keep it off your hitching post,
Osten.

556
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,884
Get it up off there, Osten.
Don't quit, guys. Fight.

557
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,344
>> Come on, Osten.
>> You got it. You got it.

558
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,513
>> That a way.
>> Come on, Osten.

559
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,350
Come on, Osten.
>> PROBST: Stay strong, you guys

560
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,685
have been out here a long time.
Get it up off that.

561
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,520
Don't use it as leverage.
Osten, you got to keep your body

562
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:24,025
off it.
(gasps)

563
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:28,071
Boom, Osten can't hang.
Rupert wins immunity for Drake.

564
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,407
(cheering)
>> Yeah!

565
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:37,622
(cheering)
You are the king!

566
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,209
>> PROBST: Drake, third straight
time, immunity.

567
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:45,838
Go on back to your camp.
>> (screams): Yeah!

568
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,216
>> PROBST: Morgan, I wish we had
different news.

569
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,385
Great effort.
Did what you could do.

570
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,220
Hung in there a long time,
just wasn't enough.

571
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,640
Tribal Council once again.
Voting somebody else out.

572
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,059
You guys can head back to camp.
See you at Tribal.

573
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:08,111
(applause)
>> You know, after this

574
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:26,087
(applause)
>> You know, after this

575
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,756
immunity challenge, you start
thinking to yourselves, "What

576
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,093
do we have to do to win?"
This was different than

577
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,470
a couple of the others,
because this, there's nothing

578
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,558
else we could've done to win.
I couldn't believe

579
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,893
you lasted that long.
I thought it'd be...

580
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,772
five minutes.
>> The weight of the world

581
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,568
was on my shoulders for a day,
and I didn't come up at the end.

582
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,945
I just didn't have the energy
left to hold it up.

583
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,780
I was spent,
my hands were chopped up,

584
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,408
and the rope just slipped...
was slipping through my hands,

585
00:33:55,491 --> 00:34:00,788
so it was just a matter of time.
>> Facing Tribal Council

586
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,416
the third time in a row is,
uh, disheartening.

587
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,043
It's one of us,
and I don't want it to be me.

588
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,005
>> Who does more around camp?
(laughs softly)

589
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:13,009
>> Um, well, of course.
Her work ethic, she never quits.

590
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,970
Even when she could slack off
if she wanted to.

591
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,306
>> Is there anything that
Lill does that D can't?

592
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,099
>> That's what I'm saying,
like, who can't do a fire?

593
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,977
Who can't go get water,
day in and day out?

594
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,939
>> Ryno, O.T. and myself and T
have... an alliance,

595
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,525
I guess you would call it.
So we're not going anywhere.

596
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,987
So it's either Darrah or Lill.
Raw intelligence.

597
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,781
>> Raw intelligence.
Her ability to think

598
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,492
outside the box.
I haven't seen any of

599
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,327
that from Darrah, tell you...
tell you the truth.

600
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,331
Not that it's not there, but...
This is a critical vote--

601
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,792
we're down to six,
we're gonna be down one more,

602
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,127
as of tonight.
Clearly, Lill's up here--

603
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,588
contributes a hell of a lot more
than Darrah,

604
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,174
from what I can see at camp.
In the challenges,

605
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,051
Darrah's probably stronger.
I don't think Lill could have

606
00:34:55,134 --> 00:35:00,181
done what Darrah did,
being suspended in the tripod.

607
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,975
The person that is...
least valuable to the tribe is

608
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,853
the one that should go tonight,
and whoever that is,

609
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,523
shouldn't have any problem
with it, because they should put

610
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,359
the interests of the tribe
ahead of their own personal

611
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,861
interests.
Now, that's a good theory...

612
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:18,199
(chuckles), but...
How would you feel if you were

613
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:22,662
the one to go tonight?
>> Very, very resentful.

614
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,206
>> Well, we'll have to have
a conversation.

615
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,416
>> Well, you know what?
>> I mean, it's a tough issue...

616
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,002
>> Listen, I'm so glad you had
the balls just to talk to me.

617
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,421
>> Oh, hell, either way, Lill,
you've been an unbelievable

618
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,508
asset to this tribe.
The least you deserve is

619
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:39,053
the brutal, honest truth.
If it's not going your way,

620
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,555
I'll tell you.
If it's going your way,

621
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,432
I'll tell you.
>> I'm just looking at it

622
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,393
that we need to win the
next challenge.

623
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,562
>> Right.
I think what's been looked at is

624
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,856
the strength and
weaknesses on both ends.

625
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,067
Just curious, um, if you
thought more about it,

626
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,070
or if it was a factor to be
concerned about or not or...

627
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:59,073
>> I mean, yeah, I want to say,
too, but I'm not gonna go

628
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:02,577
whine and mope around like she's
doing.

629
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,704
>> Darrah and I, we walked
around the cove.

630
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,664
We talked about, basically,
what's going on.

631
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,541
I let her know that...
she potentially would be

632
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,252
on the cutting block tonight,
and she was pretty nonchalant

633
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,422
about it.
Which kind of concerns me.

634
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,632
I don't know what that means.
I could very well take it as,

635
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,594
does she care, or is she overly
confident to know

636
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,804
that that's not gonna happen?
She didn't have anything

637
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,598
to say, actually.
>> Really? Did she say that

638
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,142
she's stronger or...
>> She didn't say anything.

639
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,394
>> You're kidding.
Does Darrah think

640
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,355
she's not going anywhere?
>> I have no clue.

641
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,941
>> Does Darrah deserve...
has she earned her spot in our

642
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:38,154
tribe to make it another
three days?

643
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:49,415
I don't know.
>> PROBST: Welcome to another

644
00:36:49,498 --> 00:37:01,427
I don't know.
>> PROBST: Welcome to another

645
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,722
windy Tribal Council.
So, let's get to it.

646
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,434
As of now, you're one
of the losingest tribes

647
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,479
ever, and with many more
challenges to go, chances are

648
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,981
you may set a record
that won't be broken.

649
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:19,654
So, Tijuana, is the Drake tribe
simply a better tribe?

650
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,323
>> No, they're not.
I think we have a better tribe.

651
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,826
Um, we are very focused.
It's just us coming together

652
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,828
when it comes time
for challenge time,

653
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,706
and we're not doing that.
>> PROBST: Ryno, do you agree

654
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,208
with that?
Is this tribe really

655
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:36,462
unified and focused?
>> Yeah, I believe we're...

656
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,756
we're pretty unified.
It's just one of those

657
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,800
things right now.
You got to get over a hump.

658
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,551
You know,
you're gonna get a win.

659
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,554
It's-it's inevitable.
>> PROBST: Really?

660
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,682
>> I believe it's so.
I mean, at our challenge,

661
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,977
Osten was the man-- I mean,
I think we did great.

662
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,604
>> PROBST: Osten, are you
surprised at where this tribe

663
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,023
is at?
>> I feel still we have a lot

664
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,900
of fight left in this team;
it's not over.

665
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,027
We still have a pulse;
heart's still beating.

666
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,821
And everybody goes
through a slump.

667
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,532
It's just the ability to come
out sooner than later.

668
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,701
>> PROBST: So, this is the
thing I don't get.

669
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,037
You guys don't seem worried.
You haven't won a challenge.

670
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,707
In fact, you've self-destructed
at several challenges.

671
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,750
And here you come and you're,
like, "Eh, you know what?

672
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,377
We'll get it together.
It's a slump."

673
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,212
>> Everyone's worried about it.
There's nothing worse than

674
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:21,382
going O-and-five,
and it's demoralizing,

675
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,844
but the good news is
that we're all strong-willed,

676
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,721
and I predict,
the next challenge,

677
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,557
we're gonna be on-on the top,
on the winning side.

678
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,809
>> PROBST: Well, you know,
four more Tribal Councils,

679
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,562
we have no tribe left.
So, Tijuana, do you think about

680
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,731
"We got to do
better challenges"?

681
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,025
Do you think about,
"I need something to eat"?

682
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,693
What's the overriding thought
that's going through your head

683
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,279
out here right now?
>> I think, overall,

684
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,406
um, just working together,
understanding what our strengths

685
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,908
and weaknesses are,
and how are we gonna stay

686
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,910
together as a team,
no matter what.

687
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,954
>> PROBST: Darrah,
you're living with

688
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,290
virtually nothing.
What areas are you

689
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,417
uncomfortable with?
>> Um, I guess not knowing

690
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,461
really how to build a fire,
you know.

691
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,255
I'm not good at fires.
That's Lill's job.

692
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:04,633
But, you know, I put out my 110%
at the challenges.

693
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,428
Just like yesterday,
I thought I was gonna die,

694
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,264
but quitting never
went through my mind.

695
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:12,058
>> PROBST: So, Lill,
you got to feel pretty good

696
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,268
about your place in this tribe
and what you bring to it.

697
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,729
>> I'd like to think I'm
valuable.

698
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,273
You know, I was never more proud
when, um, Andrew said

699
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:24,653
that I had good work ethics,
which I do.

700
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,614
Now, hopefully,
they'll look at that

701
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,951
and consider that
when they're voting.

702
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:36,415
>> PROBST: It is time to vote.
Ryno, you're up.

703
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,304
>> Lill, you're a great woman
and a hard worker,

704
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:53,891
and you contributed
well around camp.

705
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:06,153
>> Darrah, you are like
the Mississippi belle.

706
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:10,324
You're fragile
and know very few skills.

707
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:20,417
No hard feelings, honey.
>> This is totally based

708
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:26,465
No hard feelings, honey.
>> This is totally based

709
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:32,680
upon a strategy.
We'll see if it works.

710
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:39,103
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

711
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,321
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

712
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,115
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

713
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:56,370
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

714
00:40:56,453 --> 00:41:03,043
First vote...
Lill.

715
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:10,551
Darrah.
Lill.

716
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:15,055
That's two votes Lill,
one vote Darrah.

717
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:20,060
Three votes Lill.
Third person

718
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,565
voted out of the Morgan Tribe...
Lill.

719
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,483
That's four votes,
that's enough.

720
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:39,079
You need to bring me your torch.
Lill, the tribe has spoken.

721
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,707
Try that again.
They don't want you to go.

722
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:46,420
>> Yeah, right.
>> PROBST: It's time for you

723
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:57,598
to go.
Well, I don't think

724
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,060
tonight's vote was easy.
Don't give up on yourselves.

725
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,229
Get your torches,
head back to camp.

726
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:13,280
Good night.
Stay tuned for scenes

727
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:23,290
Good night.
Stay tuned for scenes

728
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:28,754
from our next episode.
Next time on<i> Survivor...</i>

729
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,631
At Drake,
winning has a downside.

730
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,424
>> A little more help
would be appreciated.

731
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,468
>> It's starting to get annoying
because we really want somebody

732
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:37,471
to leave.
>> At some point we should lose.

733
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:39,723
Can you do that?
>> He's a traitor.

734
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,643
If this was a pirate culture,
he'd already be dead.

735
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,686
>> PROBST: And Osten's in
trouble.

736
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,688
Osten, you're okay?
>> I need help!

737
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:52,820
>> PROBST: Hang on!
>> My biggest regret is that

738
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,197
I didn't stay in longer
to represent

739
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:59,326
my beautiful state of Ohio.
It bothers me that our leader

740
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,663
said he would get back to me
after I stated my case,

741
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:06,834
and he didn't.
Because it does seem to be

742
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:10,546
a game of a lot of deceit
and a lot of lying, and I'm not

743
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,339
real good at that.
