TELEVISION'S GREATEST SOCIAL

4
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,349
EXPERIMENT IN A NEW DIRECTION.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,143
THESE 18 AMERICANS HAVE BEEN

6
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,145
DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS THAT

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,521
REPRESENT THE QUALITIES THEY

8
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,399
MOST RELY ON IN THEIR DAILY

9
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,527
LIVES.

10

THE BRAIN TRIBE, WITH AN AVERAGE

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,365
I.Q. OF 130, THIS GROUP UTILIZES

12

THEIR INTELLECT TO ACCOMPLISH

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,409
THEIR GOALS.

14
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,120
>> IN 2010, I ENTERED THE WORLD

15

TIED FOR FIRST.

17
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,708
I CERTAINLY DON'T LOOK

18
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,709
DIABOLICAL OR LIKE A GENIUS,

19
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,754
BOTH OF WHICH I AM.

20
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,756
>> I'M PRESIDENT OF THE MIAMI

21
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:47,964

22
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:48,590
IN BASEBALL, THERE'S ONLY ONE

23
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,800
WINNER AT THE END.

24
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,468
"SURVIVOR" IS THE SAME.

25
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,886
SO I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME

26
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,511
FAIR LONG TIME, JUST NOT ON THE

27
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:53,720
BEACH.

00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,764
>> I AM AN ATTORNEY, AND MY

29
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,223

THEY THINK, HOW CUTE, THERE'S

31
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,269
THE MOM.

32
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,855
THEY DON'T KNOW I'M PROBABLY

33
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,149
MORE CUNNING AND RUTHLESS THAN

34
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,151
95% OF THE POPULATION.

35
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,987

>> I WAS AN NFL CHEERLEADER.

42
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,372
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE

43
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,874
SUPER-CONCEITED BUT FROM A GUY I

44
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,500

INTO THE GAME BECAUSE I'M GOING

49
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,257

I BELIEVE BEAUTY IS GOING TO

00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,366
I DON'T WIN, I DON'T EAT.

64
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,200
THAT'S WHAT THE GAME OF

65
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,660

THE FACE, IT DOESN'T REALLY GET

71
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,419
BETTER THAN THAT.

77
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,387
SO THIS GAME TO ME SHOULD BE

78
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:17,554
EASY.

"OH, I WANT TO VOTE HER OFF

90
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,744
RIGHT AWAY."

91
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,288
THEY DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT UGLY

92
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,831

WE'RE GOING TO CHOOSE A LEADER

190
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,453
FROM EACH TRIBE.

191
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,788
IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO

192
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,166
TALK, REALLY ALL YOU CAN DO IS

193
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,834
SIZE EACH OTHER UP BY LOOKING AT

194
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,585
EACH OTHER.

195
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,961
WE'LL START DOWN HERE ON THE END

196
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:37,587
WITH BEAUTY.

197
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,379
FIGURE IT OUT.

198
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,505
WHO DO YOU WANT TO REPRESENT

199
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,425
TRIBE?

200
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,718
THE GUY IN THE BLACK HAT, IT

201
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,928
LOOKS LIKE IT'S.

202
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,555
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

203
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,139
>> L.J.

204
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:48,681
>> Jeff: HOW DOES IT FEEL

205
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,267
MOMENTS INTO THIS GAME YOU'VE

206
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,061
BEEN SELECTED AS THE GUY TO

207
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,729
REPRESENT THE HOT TRIBE.

208
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,813
>> CLEARLY I'M THE INNER BEAUTY

209
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,147
OF THE GROUP.

210
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,940
IF I'M THE MAN THAT STICKS OUT,

211
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:58,483
WE HAVE TO DO IT.

212
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,734
>> Jeff: LET'S GO HERE IN THE

213
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,487
MIDDLE TO THE BRAWN.

214
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,488
WHO'S IS GOING TO BE?

215
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,239
>> SARAH.

216
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:05,782
>> Jeff: SARAH IN THE FRONT.

217
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,492
THE WOMAN IN THE YELLOW, WHAT'S

218
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,034
YOUR NAME?

219
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:08,951
>> TRISH.

220
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,410
>> Jeff: TRISH.

221
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,329
WHY SARAH?

222
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,955
>> SHE'S PRETTY CONFIDENT.

223
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,623
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE CAN GET THE

224
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,749
JOB DONE.

225
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,042
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET

226
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,043
DOWN TO THE THIRD TRIBE.

227
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:17,627
WHO IS GOING TO REPRESENT THE

228
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,836
BRAIN TRIBE?

229
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,546
>> WHO LOOKS THE SMARTEST.

230
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,966
( LAUGHTER )

231
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,884
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

232
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,218
ARE YOU OKAY?

233
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,969
>> YOU GUYSMENT ME, I'M YOURS.

234
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:27,678
>> THERE WE GO.

235
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,012
>> YOU GOT IT.

236
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,514
>> Jeff: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

237
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,848
>> DAVID.

238
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,391
>> Jeff: OKAY, WOMAN ON THE

239
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,060
END, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

240
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:34,310
>> KASS.

241
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,603
>> Jeff: KASS, WHY DAVID?

242
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,979
I.

243
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,647
>> I PERSONALLY NEVER TRUST A

244
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,316
MAN IN A SUIT BUT I TRUST DAVID

245
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,109
SO WE'LL GO WITH THAT.

246
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,485
>> Jeff: SO WE HAVE OUR THREE

247
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:42,693
LEADERS.

248
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,403
NOW THE GAME IS GOING TO GET A

249
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:44,779
LITTLE TOUGHER.

250
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,697
THE LEADERS OF EACH GROUP ARE

251
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,533
NOW GOING TO DECIDE WHO IS THE

252
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,492
WEAKEST FROM THEIR GROUP.

253
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,619
IF YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF

254
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,579
SOMEBODY, WHO DO YOU GET RID OF?

255
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,956
SUDDENLY, BEING THE LEADER IS

256
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,499
NOT THE POSITION YOU WANT TO BE

257
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,167
IN.

258
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:58,793
L.J., WE'RE GOING TO START WITH

259
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:58,960
YOU.

260
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,170
>> THIS GAME IN THE BEGINNING IS

261
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,798
ALL PHYSICAL CHALLENGES.

262
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,050
AND I THINK IF I HAD TO, I WOULD

263
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,302
HAVE TO PICK MORGAN.

264
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,470
>> Jeff: MORGAN.

265
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,264
WOW.

266
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,682
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN OFTEN TO YOU

267
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,266
IN LIFE.

268
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,600
>> FIRST FOR EVERYTHING.

269
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,726
>> Jeff: TAKE A STEP OVER

270
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,519
HERE, MORGAN.

271
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,855
>> IN MY PERSPECTIVE OF BEAUTY,

272
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,108
THERE IS HOT AND THERE'S CUTE.

273
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:22,525
MORGAN, SHE'S HOT.

274
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,903
WHEREAS THE OTHER GIRLS ARE,

275
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,822
LIKE, CUTE, AND ME, PERSONALLY,

276
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,533
I TRUST CUTE MORE THAN I TRUST

277
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,618
HOT.

278
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,120
>> Jeff: LET'S GO TO THE BRAWN

279
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,872
TRIBE NOW.

280
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,331
SARAH, BASED ON FIRST

281
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,208
IMPRESSIONS, WHO DO YOU DUMP

282
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:39,667
FROM THIS TRIBE?

283
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,044
>> I'VE GOT A GOOD VIBE FROM

284
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:42,336
EVERYONE.

285
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,089
I MEAN, THIS IS A REAL SUCKY

286
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:45,631
POSITION.

287
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,051
BUT I GUESS WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

288
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,845
THE WOMAN IN THE YELLOW.

289
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,304
>> Jeff: TRISH, RIGHT?

290
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,430
>> YES.

291
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,681
>> Jeff: TRISH, YOU WERE THE

292
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,600
FIRST PERSON TO SPEAK UP FOR

293
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,601
SARAH.

294
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,269
AND SHE'S THE ONE WHO ULTIMATELY

295
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,145
PUTS YOU OUT.

296
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,313
>> THAT'S OKAY.

297
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:00,730
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

298
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,815
IF THAT'S HOW SHE FEELS, THAT'S

299
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,859
HOW SHE FEELS.

300
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,028
GLRT, WE NEED ONE MORE.

301
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,070
DOWN TO THE BRAIN TRIBE.

302
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:08,654
DAVID, BECAUSE OF YOUR JACKET,

303
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,739
EVIDENTLY, YOU WERE SELECTED AS

304
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,657
THE LEADER OF THIS GROUP.

305
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,201
>> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THE

306
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:13,826
JACKET DOESN'T MATCH THE PANTS,

307
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,578
SO IT'S NOT A SUIT.

308
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,538
>> Jeff: ARE YOU USED TO

309
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,664
MAKING DECISIONS LIKE THIS,

310
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:18,873
DAVID?

311
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,707
>> I MAKE DECISIONS LIKE THIS

312
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,418
OFTEN, AND I'M GOING TO GO WITH

313
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:22,585
HIM.

314
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,169
>> Jeff: WOW, YOU DIDN'T EVEN

315
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,338
THINK ABOUT IT.

316
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,381
GUY IN THE GREEN, WHAT'S YOUR

317
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:27,590
NAME.

318
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:27,965
>> GARRET.

319
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:28,341
>> Jeff: DAVID.

320
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,717
>> WOULD JUST SAY FROM STANDING

321
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,136
HERE, THAT IS A SURPRISING

322
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,386
CHOICE.

323
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:32,887
WHAT DID YOU BASE IT ON?

324
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,807
>> FOCUSING ON I'D SAY THE LAST

325
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,934
TWO-THIRD OF THE GAME.

326
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,851
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE ALREADY

327
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,144
LOOKING TO THE END.

328
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,687
>> WELL, YOU ASKED ME TO MAKE A

329
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,939
DECISION FOR NOW, BUT EVERY

330
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,399
DECISION YOU MAKE IS BASED ON

331
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,276
WHAT'S GOOD FOR NOW AND WHAT'S

332
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,236
GOOD FOR LATER.

333
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,112
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GARRET,

334
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:50,738
TAKE A SPOT OVER HERE NEXT TO

335
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:50,947
TRISH.

336
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,574
>> MY STRATEGY WITH CHOOSING

337
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,201
GARRET IS HE'S BUILT LIKE A MACK

338
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,161
TRUCK, AND HE'S GOT BRAINS, TOO?

339
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,205
NOW, THAT'S GOING TO BE A

340
00:08:59,288 --> 00:08:59,705
FORMIDABLE COMBINATION.

341
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,749
SO I FIGURED IT WOULD MAKE SENSE

342
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,084
TO GET RID OF HIM.

343
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,919
>> Jeff: THIS IS HOW FAST

344
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:05,711
"SURVIVOR" CHANGES.

345
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,172
IF THIS HAD BEEN A TRIBAL

346
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,423
COUNCIL, ALL THREE OF YOU,

347
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,049
MORGAN, TRISH, GARRET, WOULD BE

348
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,968
OUT OF THIS GAME.

349
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,844
FORTUNATELY, FOR YOU, IT'S NOT

350
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:14,512
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

351
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,305
YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THE GAME.

352
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,847
YOU'RE NOT EVEN OUT OF YOUR

353
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,640
TRIBE, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

354
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,017
GO BACK TO CAMP WITH THEM.

355
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,310
YOU'RE GOING TO GET ON THE

356
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:21,519
CHOPPER.

357
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,061
YOU'RE GOING TO FLY AHEAD.

358
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,896
YOU WILL LAND AT CAMP EARLY, AND

359
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,439
YOU WILL MAKE A DECISION ON

360
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
BEHALF OF THE TRIBE THAT JUST

361
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,651
VOTE YOU OUT.

362
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,820
NOW, IT'S THE THREE TRIBES THAT

363
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,364
ARE WORRIED, WONDERING WHAT DID

364
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:33,656
WE JUST DO?

365
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,534
GRAB YOUR BAGS, GET ON THE

366
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:36,784
CHOPPER.

367
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:41,664
GOOD LUCK.

368
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,548
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, FOR THE

369
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,300
REST OF YOU, I HAVE MAPS TO YOUR

370
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,843
NEW HOME.

371
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,135
( APPLAUSE )

372
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,345
BEAUTY TRIBE.

373
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,723
YOU ARE SALANA.

374
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,809
BRAWN, YOU ARE APARE.

375
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,936
BRAINS, YOU ARE LUZAN.

376
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,397
GOOD NEWS IS YOU HAVE GREAT

377
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,065
WEATHER ON DAY ONE.

378
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,608
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD TO YOUR

379
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,985
NEW CAMP, GET STARTED ON

380
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,028
BUILDING SHELTER.

381
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,072
IT COULD BE A WET SEASON.

382
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:20,244
GOOD LUCK.

383
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,087
>> TO BE ISOLATED FROM THE GROUP

384
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,881
RIGHT AWAY, IT REALLY SUCKS.

385
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:36,052
LIK>> LIKE AT LEAST BOTH OF THE

386
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,345
OTHER TWO LEADERS PREPPEDDED

387
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:37,970
THEY WERE SO SAD TO HAVE TO PICK

388
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,931
THE PERSON, BUT DAVID DOESN'T

389
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:41,223
HESITATE.

390
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,475
HE IMMEDIATELY PATS ME ON THE

391
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,143
BACK AND SAYS, "GARRET."

392
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,269
HE IS THE WEAKEST.

393
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,354
WHICH IS B.S.

394
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:55,821
I'M STRONGER THAN ANY OF THEM.

395
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,198
THERE IT IS.

396
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,532
"YOU HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE.

397
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,534
YOU CAN HELP YOURSELF OR HELP

398
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,243
YOUR TRIBE."

399
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,621
ALL RIGHT, WE CAN JUST "X" THIS

400
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,289
SECOND PART OUT.

401
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,207
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO BE

402
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:06,582
HELPING MYSELF.

403
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:10,461
IF YOU CHOOSE TO HELP YOUR

404
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,837
TRIBE, YOU'LL BE GIVEN A SECOND

405
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,755
BAG OF RICE.

406
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,382
IF YOU CHOOSE TO HELP YOURSELF,

407
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,050
YOU'LL BE GIVEN THE CLUE TO THE

408
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,427
LOCATIONAVE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

409
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:18,636
IDOL.

410
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,220
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I'M

411
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,721
ALREADY ON THE OUTS WITH MY

412
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,640
TRIBE SO THIS IS A COMPLETE

413
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:22,932
NO-BRAINER.

414
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,016
OBVIOUSLY, I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR

415
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,684
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

416
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,852
SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE.

417
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,895
STRAIGHT FORWARD.

418
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,896
WHEN PEOPLE SEE MY BODY, OFTEN

419
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,776
THEY'RE LIKE, "HE'S JUST A DUMB

420
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,151
JOCK!"

421
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,613
BUT I WAS VALEDICTORIAN OF NIGH

422
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,240
CLASS, 99 PERCENTILE S.A.IT IS,

423
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,075
AND FOR A LIVING I'M A

424
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,326
HIGH-STAKES PROFESSIONAL POKER

425
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:42,576
PLAYER.

426
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,160
SO ANYTHING I DO IN MY LIFE, I

427
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,787
GO ALL IN.

428
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,875
"FIND THE PLACE WHERE WATER'S

429
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,126
FALLING."

430
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,502
SO GO TO THE WATER FALL.

431
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,837
WITHOUT QUESTION, DAVID MAKE THE

432
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,131
ASININE DECISION HE DID WORKS TO

433
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,382
MY ADVANTAGE, BUT HE'S A THREAT,

434
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:05,015
AND I WANT HIM OUT OF THE GAME.

435
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,685
>> WHEN SARAH HAD TO PICK THE

436
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,853
WEAK OF THE TRIBE, WHEN I LOOKED

437
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:13,858
AROUND, I WAS CLEARLY THE OLD

438
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,108
OLDEST.

439
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,653
I WAS CLEARLY THE THINNEST, SO I

440
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,195
WASN'T SURPRISED IT WAS ME.

441
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:18,821
"IF YOU CHOOSE TO HELP YOURSELF

442
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,947
YOU'LL BE GIVEN THE CLUE TO A

443
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,492
LOCATION OF--" OH, CRAP!

444
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:23,659
SHOOT!

445
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,327
WHEN I SAW THAT NOTE, I WAS LIKE

446
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:25,870
OH, GEEZ.

447
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,205
I'VE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION

448
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:28,956
WHETHER IT'S FOR ME OR THE TEAM.

449
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,041
INITIALLY, I COULD HEAR MYSELF

450
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,002
SAYING, "DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

451
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:33,878
GO AND GET THE IDOL FOR YOURSELF

452
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,005
AND PROTECT YOURSELF."

453
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:36,839
GOD, I'M SO NOT SELFISH, BUT

454
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,758
MAYBE I NEED TO BE.

455
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,260
I HAVE BEEN DIVORCED FOR 15

456
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,471
YEARS, SUPPORTING AND RAISING MY

457
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,221
CHILDREN EMOTIONALLY AND

458
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:44,972
FINANCIALLY, AND IT'S BEEN

459
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,390
REALLY HARD.

460
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,683
YET, AT THE SAME TIME, I HAVE

461
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,477
ALWAYS BEEN A TEAM PLAYER.

462
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,395
IT'S JUST WHO I AM.

463
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,188
YOU KNOW WHAT?

464
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,981
I'M GOING TO GO WITH HELPING THE

465
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:54,190
GROUP.

466
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,400
I'M GOING TO PASS UP THE IDOL.

467
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,068
I JUST WENT WITH MY GUT AND

468
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:58,402
SAID,UN WHAT?

469
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,070
I'M JUST GOING TO GO WITH THE

470
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:00,279
TEAM.

471
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,697
I HOPE I DON'T KICK MYSELF FOR

472
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,865
THE REST OF THE GAME ON THAT

473
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,908
ONE, BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN

474
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,533
DO NOW.

475
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,826
SO I JUST HOPE I DON'T REGRET

476
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:12,833
IT.

477
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,209
>> I'M SURPRISED.

478
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,377
I WAS VOTED OFF FIRST.

479
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,713
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE MORE PHYSICAL

480
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,714
STRENGTH THAN THE OTHER TWO

481
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,257
LADIES, AND I KIND OF THOUGHT I

482
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,053
HAD THE GUYS UNDER MY THUMB.

483
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,888
BUB MAYBE L.J. WAS TEMPTED BY MY

484
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,516
LOOKS AND DEPARTMENT WANT ME

485
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:28,724
AROUND.

486
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,975
IT MESSED WITH HIS HEAD.

487
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,393
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOOD AT.

488
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:31,894
MAYBE HE CAN SENSE THAT.

489
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,563
I HOLD GRUDGES BIG TIME.

490
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,482
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HIM FOR

491
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:36,690
THIS.

492
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,609
"TAKE A STROLL ALONG THE ROCKS."

493
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,777
THIS IS A GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO

494
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,945
SAVE YOURSELF, SO OF COURSE I'M

495
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,696
GOING TO LOOK FOR THE IDOL.

496
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,906
I GUESS I'M A SELFISH PERSON,

497
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,241
BUT IF I CAN FIND IT, IT'S GOING

498
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,368
TO BE A HUGE GAME CHANGER FOR

499
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:52,039
SURE.

500
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,874
>> CLEARLY GOING TO HAVE TO GET

501
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,044
DOWN AND DIRT INTO THIS WATER.

502
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,420
THE CLUE TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

503
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,588
IDOL SAID IT'S RIGHT BY THE

504
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,466
WATER FALL.

505
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,092
UNFORTUNATELY THESE HIDE AND GO

506
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,553
SEEK ACTIVITIES IS NOT MY AREA

507
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,305
OF EXPERTISE.

508
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,641
I'VE BEEN IN THE SITUATION AT A

509
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,225
POKER TABLE PLAYING FOR HUGE

510
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,561
AMOUNTS OF MONEY, AND I DIDN'T

511
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,729
GET STRESSED OUT ABOUT IT.

512
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,106
SO THIS SHOULD BE CHILD'S PLAY.

513
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,402
I'M EXWARGS MYSELF BY NOT BEING

514
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,988
ABLE TO FIND THE STUPID IDOL

515
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,781
RIGHT NOW.

516
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:26,323
WAIT A MINUTE.

517
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,241
WHAT'S THIS?

518
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,245
I FEEL SOMETHING!

519
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,913
WHAT IS THIS?

520
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,457
>> LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT IN

521
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,125
HERE.

522
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,670
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL!

523
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,421
OH!

524
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,590
FINALLY, I WAS ABLE TO FIND THE

525
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,507
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

526
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,633
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO KEEP IT

527
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,175
TO MYSELF.

528
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,927
BUT WHAT AN AMAZING START TO THE

529
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:47,595
GAME.

530
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,471
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL WILL

531
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,640
KEEP YOU SAFE FROM BEING VOTED

532
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,434
OFF AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

533
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,102
ME HAVING THE IDOL PUT ME IN A

534
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:55,853
REALLY STRONG POSITION.

535
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,021
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL DAVID

536
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,814
WAS THINKING, BUT I PROMISE YOU,

537
00:14:58,897 --> 00:14:59,481
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY

538
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:07,573
POWER TO GET RID OF HIM.

539
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,158
>> THE CLUE SAID THAT THE HIDDEN

540
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,409
IMMUNITY IDOL WOULD BE SOMEWHERE

541
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,160
NEAR ROCKS.

542
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,704
SO IMMEDIATELY, I THOUGHT OF THE

543
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,830
HUGE ROCK SHELF TO THE RIGHT OF

544
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:15,122
OUR CAMP.

545
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,750
THERE ARE SO MANY LITTLE

546
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,043
CREVICES AND NOOKS AND CRANNIES

547
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,420
THAT THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

548
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,255
COULD BE HIDDEN BUT I DON'T KNOW

549
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,590
WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE HERE.

550
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,174
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I

551
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:25,341
HAVE.

552
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,384
I JUST KNOW THAT I HAVE TO FIND

553
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:35,559
IT.

554
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,527
>> WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE BEACH

555
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,696
IT'S LIKE, WHERE'S MORGAN?

556
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,364
SHE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND

557
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,533
IT WAS JUST VERY SUSPICIOUS.

558
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,159
>> I WAS CLIMBING ON THE ROCKS,

559
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,829
THEN I SAW MY OTHER TRIBE MATES

560
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,872
COME STROLLING UP ON THE BEACH,

561
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,917
AND MY HEART JUST JUMPED IN MY

562
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,167
THROAT.

563
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,085
IF I HAD BEEN OUTED TRYING TO

564
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,337
FIND THE IDOL, AND I THOUGHT I

565
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,505
HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING

566
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,299
OR I'M GOING HOME FOR SURE.

567
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,772
>> OH, MY GOD!

568
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,232
THIS IS OUR HUMBLE ABODY.

569
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,235
I WONDER WHERE MORGAN IS.

570
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,195
>> MY OTHER TRIBEMATES COME

571
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,905
STROLLING UP ON THE BEACH.

572
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,031
IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT I WAS

573
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:31,240
DOING.

574
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,076
I HAD ALREADY BEEN OUTED AS THE

575
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,495
WEAKEST PERSON AND NOW I'M GOING

576
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,913
BEHIND THEIR BACKS AND TRYING TO

577
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:38,414
FIND THE IDOL.

578
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,164
I'M LIKE I'M DONE.

579
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,332
>> I WONDER WHAT DECISION SHE

580
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,667
HAD TO MAKE.

581
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,168
>> THEN I REALIZED I COULD JUST

582
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,504
TOTALLY LIE AND SAY THAT, "OH,

583
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,171
YEAH, I PICKED THE SHELTER

584
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,549
MATERIAL AND FISHING STUFF OVER

585
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:48,757
COMFORT.

586
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,217
>> HERE SHE COMES.

587
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,177
>> I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKES WHAT I

588
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:52,428
PICKED.

589
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,679
>> WHAT DID YOU GET TO DECIDE?

590
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,180
>> I PICKED RICE, SHELTER STUFF,

591
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,224
AND FISHING.

592
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,268
>> GOOD CHOICE.

593
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:04,565
>> I FOR SURE THINK I FOOLED

594
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:04,773
THEM.

595
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,233
NOW I HAVE HOWEVER MANY DAYS TO

596
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:06,942
LOOK FOR THE IDOL.

597
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,028
I'LL HAVE TO BE REALLY SLY ABOUT

598
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,070
IT BUT I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE

599
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,030
ANY CLUE.

600
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:12,489
THERE ARE TIDE POOLS.

601
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,408
THAT'S WHAT I WAS CHECKING OUT.

602
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,034
>> MORGAN IS ALREADY IN HER

603
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:16,618
UNDERWEAR, JUST LIKE A MERMAID

604
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,162
THAT WALKED OUT OF THE OCEAN,

605
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,121
WHICH HAD ME A LITTLE NERVOUS

606
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,207
BECAUSE SHE'S WAY TOO CALM AND

607
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,002
COLLECTED FOR SOMEONE JUST VOTED

608
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:25,169
OUT.

609
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,962
WE'RE GOING TO GET THIRSTY REAL

610
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:27,254
QUICK.

611
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,672
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WAS

612
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:28,964
THINKING.

613
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,673
>> FIRE AND SHELTER?

614
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,966
>> LET'S FIGURE OUT WHERE THE

615
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:31,383
FIRE IS GOING TO GO.

616
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,261
>> SHE EITHER ALREADY HAS AN

617
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,095
IMMUNITY IDOL OR SHE HAS A CLUE.

618
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,183
SO I BETTEROB MY BEST BEHAVIOR

619
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,851
BECAUSE SHE CAN BE THE HOT GIRL

620
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:41,185
WITH A GRUDGE.

621
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,645
>> YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT IT

622
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,188
PERSONALLY, I HOPE.

623
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:44,980
>> IT'S OKAY.

624
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,190
I'M JUST HAVE TO PROVE YOU

625
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:46,398
WRONG.

626
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:46,648
>> GOOD.

627
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,817
>> MORGAN WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE

628
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,111
FOR US, YOU KNOW, SOME GOOD

629
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,279
THINGS.

630
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,573
I KIND OF FELT THAT BOOSTED HER

631
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,240
CONFIDENCE A LITTLE BIT.

632
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,201
BUT I'M NO DUMMY.

633
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,994
I KNOW A SCORPD WOMAN WHEN I SEE

634
00:17:59,077 --> 00:17:59,161
HER.

635
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,245
SHE WAS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

636
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,289
FOR ME TO USE MY PURPLE PANTS

637
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,082
AND KIND OF, LIKE, MY

638
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:04,666
PERSONALITY TO KIND OF GET IN

639
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,334
WITH HER.

640
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,128
I WOULDN'T HAVE VOTED YOU OUT,

641
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:08,504
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

642
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,254
>> HE'S OLD, SO.

643
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:16,303
>> YEAH, RIGHT.

644
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,222
>> FOR SURE.

645
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,264
ME AND BRICE KIND OF MADE A

646
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,600
LITTLE CONNECTION, SO FOR RIGHT

647
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,018
NOW, WE'RE STICKING TOGETHER.

648
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,603
HE'S GOT MY BACK.

649
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:32,820
I'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

650
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,112
>> PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING

651
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,405
FROM US BECAUSE THEY LABELED US

652
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,990
THE BEAUTIES.

653
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,617
THEY THINK IT'S JUST A TRIBE

654
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,203
FULL OF PRINCESSES AND GUYS WHO

655
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,247
ARE, LIKE, PRETTY BOYS WHO DON'T

656
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,290
REALLY WANT TO GET DIRTY.

657
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,208
>> GO, BOYS, GO.

658
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,918
YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

659
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,753
WE'VE GOT A COCONUT WAITING!

660
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,754
>> KEEP BLOWING, BABY?

661
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,255
>> YOU GOT IT?

662
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,173
>> COME ON, BABY.

663
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,843
>> HEAVENLY FATHER, PLEASE HELP

664
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,218
US GET THIS FIRE.

665
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,804
>> OH!

666
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:58,971
YES!

667
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,972
>> FIRE!

668
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,014
>> WE'RE GOOD, BUDDY.

669
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,224
>> I WAS SO EXCITED.

670
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,308
WE GOT FIRE RIGHT AWAY, YOU

671
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,185
KNOW, WITHOUT FLINT, WHICH IS

672
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,979
VERY HARD TO DO.

673
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,772
SO I'M LOVING OUR TRIBE.

674
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:13,944
YOU GUYS ARE TH THE BOMB.

675
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,237
>> THERE'S NOTHING IN THEIR

676
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,822
MINDS THAT WANTS TO CONNECT THE

677
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,698
BEAUTY TRIBE WITH SUCCESS BUT

678
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,073
IT'S HAPPENING.

679
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,867
WE CAN KICK BUTT OUT HERE, AND

680
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:30,419
WE'RE DOING IT.

681
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,712
>> IT'S OKAY!

682
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,296
IT'S OKAY!

683
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,589
I KNOW YOU HAD TO MAKE A

684
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,798
DECISION ON A QUICK NOTE.

685
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,008
I GET THAT.

686
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,176
>> I'M SO SORRY.

687
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,219
PLEASE, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

688
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:39,678
HOW ARE YOU?

689
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,220
>> GOOD.

690
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,430
>> BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY SEEN AS

691
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,265
BEING THE WEAKEST, I FELT LIKE

692
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,268
THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE THEY WERE

693
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,936
GOING TO COME TO CAMP THINKING

694
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,479
THAT THIS OILEDDER, SKINNY WOMAN

695
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,273
WE ELIMINATED IS WEAK, SO I HAD

696
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,066
TO GET MYSELF RIGHT BACK ON TO

697
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,151
EQUAL TERMS WITH ALL OF THEM.

698
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:54,776
I ACTUALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

699
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,570
TO GO AND LOOK FOR THE IDOL BUT

700
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,362
I WENT FOR THE GROUP AND GET THE

701
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,156
EXTRA BAG OF RICE.

702
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,366
>> I KNEW YOU WOULD.

703
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,704
<i>( APPLAUSE ).</i>

704
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,288
>> AS SOON AS WE ARRIVED TO

705
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,917
CAMP, TRISH CAME WITH OPEN ARMS.

706
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,003
SHE SAID I HAD THE CHOICE OF

707
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,714
LOOKING FOR THE IDOL FOR MYSELF

708
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,633
OR GETTING A SECOND BAG OF RICE.

709
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,259
IF I WAS IN TRISH'S SHOES THERE

710
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,261
WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY ONE BAG OF

711
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,263
RICE AND ONE IDOL IN MY POCKET.

712
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,432
WHO WANTS TO TALK BUILDING

713
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:25,641
SHELTER?

714
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,601
LET'S SPLIT UP.

715
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:32,314
CHOOSE DIFFERENT CHORES.

716
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,565
>> LOOKING THROUGH ALL OF MY

717
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,483
TEAM MEMBERS, I COULD TELL ANY

718
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,945
THAT ANY CHALLENGE THAT WILL

719
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,030
HAVE PHYSICAL STRENGTH IN IT

720
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:40,572
WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO

721
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:40,822
DOMINATE.

722
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,658
WE HAVE THE BIGGEST MAN OUT

723
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:42,824
HERE.

724
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:48,789
HE'S, LIKE, EIGHT FEET TALL.

725
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:53,293
>> I PLAYED A LITTLE BASKETBALL.

726
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,046
>> ME BEING A BASKETBALL

727
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:56,672
ENTHUSIAST, I IMMEDIATELY KNEW

728
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,633
WHO THAT WAS, CLIFF ROBINSON,

729
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,635
PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERS, ONE OF MY

730
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,427
FAVORITE PLAYERS GROWING UP, AND

731
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,721
EVERYONE SEEMED STOKED TO HAVE

732
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,014
HIM ON OUR TRIBE BUT I DON'T

733
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,557
THINK ANYONE'S MAKING A REALLY

734
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,475
BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

735
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,309
>> WHO DID YOU PLAY FOR?

736
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,355
>> I PLAYED FOR THE PORTLAND

737
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:13,689
TRAILBLAZERS.

738
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,982
>> COOL!

739
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,525
>> THE PHOENIX SUN.

740
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,901
THE DETROIT PISTONS.

741
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,611
THE FACT THAT I'M A FORMER

742
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,612
BASKETBALL PLAYER COULD HURST

743
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,030
ME, BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

744
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,448
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY REALLY

745
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,367
HAVE ANY INTEREST IN BASKETBALL,

746
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,868
SO FOR ME, THAT'S JUST FINE.

747
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,453
I CAN PLAY THIS GAME, NOT WORRY

748
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,455
ABOUT MY TRIBEMATES JUDGING ME

749
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,624
FOR WHAT I DID, AND THEY'RE JUST

750
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,584
LOOKING AT ME AS CLIFF ROBINSON,

751
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:42,467
ONE OF THE TRIBEMEMBERS OF

752
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:42,843
"SUR"SURVIVOR."

753
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,678
>> YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME

754
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,095
TO DO.

755
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,098
>> WHEN I GET DONE, I WILL HAVE

756
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,809
NO OXYGEN LEFT SO YOU'LL HAVE TO

757
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,810
BLOW ON IT FOR A WHILE.

758
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,812
>> I'VE BEEN A COP FOR A WHILE

759
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,815
AND THERE IS A LOOK COPS HAVE

760
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,483
AND TONES LOOKS LIKE ONE.

761
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,028
WILL YOU LOOK AT ME REAL QUICK

762
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,612
AND BE HONEST WITH ME?

763
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:02,946
ARE YOU A COP?

764
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,072
>> NO.

765
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:04,614
>> YOU SWEAR?

766
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,074
>> I SWEAR, WHY?

767
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:06,575
I WOULDN'T HIDE THAT.

768
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,492
>> WHAT DO YOU DO?

769
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,119
>> CONSTRUCTION.

770
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,163
THAT'S MY MAIN THING, BUT I DO

771
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:11,496
ROOF, TOO.

772
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
>> JERSEY CITY.

773
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,832
>> YOU LOOK LIKE A COP.

774
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:14,499
>> I HAVE A TATTOO HERE.

775
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,793
THEY DON'T ALLOW THAT.

776
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,377
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

777
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,796
>> I HAVE PLENTY OF COP FRIENDS.

778
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,257
YOU DON'T KNOW NO COPS?

779
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,799
>> I DO.

780
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,384
>> I HAVE MAYBE 50 FRIENDS WHO

781
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,927
ARE COPS.

782
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,220
I THOUGHT FAIR SECOND SHOULD I

783
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:27,637
TELL THEM I'M A COP.

784
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,265
AND I THOUGHT IF I TELL THEM I'M

785
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,433
A POLICE OFFICER THEY'LL BE

786
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,393
THINKING THIS GUY IS STRATEGIC,

787
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,895
TACTICAL, AND SHARP ON HIS TOES

788
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,146
AND THEY'LL BE RIGHT SO

789
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,607
OBVIOUSLY I WILL BE A THREAT TO

790
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,525
THEM SO THEY'LL PROBABLY TRY TO

791
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,109
BLINDSIDE ME.

792
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,360
WHAT DO YOU DO, SARAH?

793
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,111
>> I'M A QOP.

794
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,696
>> ARE YOU REALLY?

795
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,699
>> INTERROGATION IS PART OF MY

796
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,618
DAILY DUTIES AND I GET LIED TO

797
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,036
EVERY DAY AT WORK AND THERE'S

798
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,997
SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME FEEL

799
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,707
UNEASY ABOUT TONY.

800
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,460
>> YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU THE

801
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:58,668
TRUTH.

802
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:58,960
I'M NOT A.

803
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,545
>> YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

804
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,671
JUST TELL ME YOU'RE A COP.

805
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:01,963
>> COME ON!

806
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,548
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE

807
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:03,757
DOES.

808
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,842
ALL I KNOW IS I DON'T THINK I

809
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,552
CAN TRUST HIM, SO HE'S GOT TO GO

810
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,346
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

811
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:18,647
THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY.

812
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,606
>> WHAT SUP, GUYS?

813
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,025
>> OH, MY GOSH!

814
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,402
>> GET A LITTLE GROUP HUG HERE

815
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:24,611
GOING.

816
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,446
>> HAD IT NAILED, MAN.

817
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,614
>> WHEN DAVID CAME OUT AND SAID

818
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,866
HE WAS GOING TO PICK GARRET, I

819
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,534
THOUGHT YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

820
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,953
YOU'RE PICKING THE ONE GUY WHO

821
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,496
CAN HELP US IN CHALLENGES AND

822
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,914
YOU'RE OSTRACIZING HIM ALREADY.

823
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:36,623
IT'S A TERRIBLE MOVE.

824
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,083
>> DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE A

825
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:38,333
DECISION?

826
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,001
>> YEAH, I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF

827
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,044
THINGS ACCOMPLISHED.

828
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:41,628
I FOUND STILL WATER, AND I,

829
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,964
LIKE, BALLED IT ALL THE WAY TO

830
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,006
THE WATER FALL.

831
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,215
>> GOOD.

832
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,551
>> THERE'S A WATERFALL, YEAH,

833
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:47,843
YEAH, YEAH.

834
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,344
>> SHUT UP.

835
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,638
>> I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND

836
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,098
PRETEND LIKE I'M SOME ARCHITECT

837
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,683
SO I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO BUILD A

838
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:54,891
SHELTER.

839
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,310
>> I'M A NUCLEAR ENGINEER.

840
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:57,519
>> WOW.

841
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,854
>> I HAVE AN IDEA FOR A SHELTER.

842
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,771
>> YOU DO.

843
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,939
>> I'VE GOT A PLAN.

844
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:01,398
>> AWESOME.

845
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,399
>> THERE WE GO!

846
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,193
>> I HAVE MY Ph.D. IN NUCLEAR

847
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:05,777
ENGINEERING SO I THINK I'M THE

848
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,779
SMARTEST PERSON HERE, HANDS

849
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:07,988
DOWN.

850
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,573
I'M GOING TO BUILD THAT SHELTER.

851
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,533
I'M NOT GOING TO CUT THE BAMBOO

852
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,826
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL THEM HOW

853
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:13,618
TO BUILD IT AND IT'S GOING TO BE

854
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,537
AN AWESOME SHELTER.

855
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,872
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FOUR STAKES

856
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,622
ABOUT THREE FEET HIGH.

857
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,375
I WANT YOU TO CUT, LIKE, EIGHT

858
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:20,625
BAMBOO.

859
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,209
THAT'S THE FIRST THING I NEED,

860
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:26,256
THE BASE.

861
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:26,381
.

862
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,799
>> NICE.

863
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:27,924
.

864
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:32,679
>> GARRET, WHACK THAT THING.

865
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,389
GET THE NEXT ONE RIGHT HERE.

866
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,392
WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER ONE THAT

867
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:37,767
IS THIS HEIGHT.

868
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,310
>> OKAY.

869
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,103
>> GO AHEAD.

870
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,688
>> OKAY.

871
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,939
>> SHE TOOK THE LEADERSHIP ROLE

872
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,483
AND HER APPROACH IS NOT THE

873
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,736
SLEEKEST, AND SHE DOES COME OFF

874
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,654
REALLY CONFRONTATIONAL AND

875
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:49,863
BOSSY.

876
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,200
>> YOU GO GET BAMBOO.

877
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,910
THAT ONE LOOKS A LITTLE TALL.

878
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,828
WHY DON'T YOU DO ONE OF THE

879
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,162
SHORTER ONES.

880
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,665
NO, NO, NO FLAT BACK, YUP, LIKE

881
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,208
THAT.

882
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,084
OKAY, MAKE LIKE A PALM FROND OR

883
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,920
SOME STACKS OF ROCKS.

884
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:05,670
ALL WE HAVE LEFT IS LONG PIECES.

885
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:10,759
>> RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AN ENGINEER

886
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,676
J'TIA WHO SAYS SHE CAN BUILD A

887
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,927
SHELTER.

888
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,970
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

889
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:14,763
DIG THERE AND DIGGING SEEMS LIKE

890
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,556
THE BIGGEST FACTOR.

891
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,058
>> WHY DON'T WE MOVE THAT OVER

892
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:18,266
THERE?

893
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,684
>> SHE HAS DECISIVENESS OF A

894
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:19,935
LEADER.

895
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,686
SHE HAS THE BOSSINESS FOR SURE,

896
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,356
BUT SHE DOESN'T EXACTLY HAVE IT

897
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,482
ALL HERE.

898
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,566
>> THIS AIN'T GOING TO HOLD US

899
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,318
UP ANYWAY.

900
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,444
LOOK, IT'S--

901
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,445
>>AL OUR WEIGHT.

902
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,197
>> WE HAVE, LIKE, 500 POUNDS.

903
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,032
>> YEAH, WE DO, BUT BAMBOO IS

904
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,242
STRONG, AND IT'S THE WHOLE

905
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,034
STRUCTURE PART OF IT.

906
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,661
ALL RIGHT, I NEED SPLIT BAMBOO.

907
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,331
>> J'TIA I DON'T APPRECIATE HER

908
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:41,623
ATTITUDE.

909
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,874
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DOES.

910
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,792
MAKES HER UNCOMFORTABLE.

911
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,960
>> SHE'S QUITE BOSSY.

912
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:45,877
>> VERY BOSSY.

913
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,753
>> BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO

914
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,003
ANYTHING.

915
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,588
>> YEAH, SO I WOULD JUST LET HER

916
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,924
DO WHAT SHE DOES, YOU KNOW?

917
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,633
>> THAT'S MY PLAN.

918
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,844
>> J'TIA'S TAKEN CHARGE OF DOING

919
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,721
STUFF BUT SHE DOESN'T DO

920
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:56,972
ANYTHING.

921
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,808
SHE JUST SORT OF BARKS ORDERS TO

922
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,058
US.

923
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,351
IN MY CAREER, I HAVE ENOUGH

924
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,310
EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE WHO LOOK

925
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:02,936
LIKE THEY CAN GET THINGS DONE

926
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,813
BUT YOU PUT THEM AT THE PLATE,

927
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,606
PUT A BAT IF THEIR HAND, AND ALL

928
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,650
OF A SUDDEN THEY LOOK LIKE BUGS

929
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,318
BONE, AND THAT'S J'TIA.

930
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,611
>> THIS IS NOT GOING TO TAKE

931
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:11,820

I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

1217
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,263
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GO OVER WE

1218
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,973
SHOULD HAVE EVERYBODY PICKED

1219
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:01,599
THAT UP AND WALKED.

1220
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,268
>> WE CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE --

1221
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,521
>> THE OTHER TRIBES.

1222
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,313
>> WE CAN'T KEEP SAYING STUPID

1223
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,107
STUFF LIKE, "WE'RE SO MUCH

1224
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:10,525
SMARTER THAN THEM."

1225
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,443
THEY'RE KICKING OUR ASS.

1226
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,986
>> AT THE CHALLENGE WE SUCKED.

1227
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,530
I CAN'T REALLY BLAME ANY

1228
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:15,905
PARTICULAR PERSON.

1229
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,199
I THINK IT'S EVERYONE, AND IT'S,

1230
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,617
LIKE, WE'RE BOOK SMART, BUT WHEN

1231
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,536
IT COMES TO PLAYING THIS GAME,

1232
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,037
WE'RE DUMB.

1233
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,580
>> WE PERFORMED EXACTLY HOW WE

1234
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,499
HAVE BEEN PERFORMING FOR THREE

1235
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:26,916
DAYS-- NO EXECUTION.

1236
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,794
>> WE HAD NOT ASSIGNED TASKS.

1237
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,046
>> J'TIA TOOK THE FIRST KEY.

1238
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:33,798
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING

1239
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,132
KEYS.

1240
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:34,674
>> I WAS.

1241
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,842
SHE LITERALLY GRABBED IT OUT OF

1242
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,050
THE AIR.

1243
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,635
>> BUT SHE DIDN'T TAKE THE

1244
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,135
CHAINS OUT.

1245
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:38,761
>> I KNOW--

1246
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:39,428
>> WHATEVER.

1247
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,179
I WANT TO MOVE PAST IT BUT WHAT

1248
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,266
I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS

1249
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,267
J'TIA VERSUS GARRET.

1250
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,310
THAT WAS A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE.

1251
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,230
AND GARRET WAS NOT HELPING.

1252
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,648
PERSONALLY, I'D LIKE TO GET RID

1253
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,191
OF GARRET BECAUSE I VIEW HIM AS

1254
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,611
A BIGGER THREAT TO ME THAN

1255
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:55,903
J'TIA.

1256
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,155
I'M THINKING ABOUT DAY 39.

1257
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,699
AND MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT

1258
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,742
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT PUT

1259
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,994
HIM ON THE BRAINS TRIBE.

1260
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:03,870
HE HASN'T TOLD US.

1261
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,039
AND THAT SCARES ME REALLY TO MY

1262
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:07,248
CORE.

1263
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:07,748
>> JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

1264
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,292
>> NO, J'TIA.

1265
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:09,834
ALL THE WAY.

1266
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,376
>> ALL RIGHT.

1267
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,002
THIS TIME--

1268
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,337
>> FOR HARMONY, TRIBE HARMONY.

1269
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:17,133
I JUST WANT TO SAY J'TIA, SEE

1270
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:17,300
YA.

1271
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,676
WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YOU.

1272
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,094
DAVID, HE WANTS GARRET TO GO

1273
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:20,678
FIRST, BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

1274
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,681
HE'S OUR STRONGEST GUY.

1275
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,433
PLUS HE'S A WORK HORSE.

1276
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,225
BUT J'TIA, SHE HAS NOT BEEN

1277
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,977
PULLING HER WEIGHT.

1278
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,519
SHE'S BEEN DOING A LOT OF

1279
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,438
DIRECTION, AND NO PRODUCTION.

1280
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,607
AND EVERYONE SEES IT.

1281
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,025
SHE'S DEAD WEIGHT.

1282
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:43,284
SO LET'S JUST SEND HER HOME.

1283
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,119
>> THIS SUCKS.

1284
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,203
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1285
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,163
WHO DO YOU WANT TO VOTE OUT?

1286
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,415
ARE YOU GOOD AS LONG AS IT'S NOT

1287
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:49,916
YOU.

1288
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,334
>> HONESTLY, I'M LEANING TOWARDS

1289
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:51,500
YOU.

1290
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,251
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PULL YOUR

1291
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,794
WEIGHT AROUND CAMP.

1292
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,212
YOU TELL US A LOT WHAT TO DO,

1293
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,631
BUT I DON'T SEE YOU, YOU KNOW,

1294
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,299
DOING ANYTHING.

1295
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,467
>> I THINK I MORE THAN PULLED MY

1296
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,844
WEIGHT IN THE CHALLENGE, THOUGH.

1297
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,471
>> WELL, YOU'VE BEEN RESTING FOR

1298
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,096
THREE DAYS.

1299
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,430
I MEAN, YOU--

1300
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,891
>> ARE YOU MORE THAN WELCOME TO

1301
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:07,433
YOUR OPINION.

1302
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:07,683
>> RIGHT.

1303
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,309
>> I GET IT.

1304
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,478
>> I MEAN, I'M AN HONEST PERSON.

1305
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,021
>> I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT.

1306
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:12,647
>> THAT'S HOW I AM.

1307
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,940
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.

1308
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,358
>> SO IT'S TIME TO SCRAMBLE,

1309
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:15,650
PROBABLY.

1310
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,320
>> I WENT UP TO KASS, AND SHE

1311
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,613
WAS VERY HONEST.

1312
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,740
SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T THINK I

1313
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,408
WORK AROUND CAMP AND THAT I'M

1314
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,577
GOING HOME.

1315
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,746
KASS KIND OF HURT MY FEELINGS A

1316
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,747
LITTLE BIT.

1317
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,539
I'M NOT LAZY.

1318
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,710
WE NEED A SHELTER, AND IF I

1319
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,504
DIDN'T LIGHT A FIRE UNDER THE

1320
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,505
TRIBE'S BUTT WE WOULDN'T HAVE

1321
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:37,797
GOT IT DONE.

1322
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,091
I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING

1323
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:40,383
MOTIVATING.

1324
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,133
CLEARLY IT, DOESN'T COME OFF

1325
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:41,550
THAT WAY.

1326
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,178
I JUST HOPE I HAVE NOT RUINED BY

1327
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:44,428
CHANCES.

1328
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,513
I MIGHT HAVE.

1329
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,347
>> WHAT'S UP, GIRL?

1330
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,516
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M PRETTY MUCH

1331
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:48,683
TOAST.

1332
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,727
I JUST TALKED TO KASS.

1333
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,104
AND SHE'S LEANING TOWARDS VOTING

1334
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:53,354
ME OUT.

1335
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,480
>> SHE TOLD YOU THAT?

1336
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:54,689
>> YEAH.

1337
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,315
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE I'M NOT

1338
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,525
DOING ENOUGH AROUND CAMP?

1339
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,609
>> HONESTLY, THERE WAS ONE TIME

1340
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,527
YOU WERE SITTING DOWN AND YOU'RE

1341
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,696
LIKE, "MOVE THAT OVER THERE.

1342
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,530
MOVE THAT OVER THERE."

1343
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,532
AND I THINK IT MAY HAVE RUBBED

1344
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,491
SOME PRIME THE WRONG WAY.

1345
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:05,866
>> YOU GUYS OKAY?

1346
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,202
>> YEAH, COME SIT.

1347
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,745
>> I'M FEELING A LITTLE

1348
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,246
APPREHENSIVE.

1349
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,372
>> BUT THE THING IS, YOU'RE

1350
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,458
ALWAYS SCARED, YOU KNOW.

1351
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:14,917
>> YEAH.

1352
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:15,710
>> I'M SCARED.

1353
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,460
BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

1354
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,169
YOU'RE FINE.

1355
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,254
LOOK AT ME.

1356
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:18,921
LOOK AT ME.

1357
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,715
I'M NOT LYING TO YOU.

1358
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,883
IF YOU ASK ME, DAVID IS A

1359
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,135
STRATEGIC THREAT TO ALL OF US,

1360
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,511
BUT WE VOTE TOGETHER.

1361
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,595
DAVID'S GOING TO GO HOME, AND

1362
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,889
WE'RE ALL GOING TO FEEL BETTER,

1363
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,390
OKAY.

1364
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,808
J'TIA IS DEFINITELY PRETTY

1365
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,435
PARANOID RIGHT NOW, AND FOR WHAT

1366
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,771
IT'S WORTH SHE HAS A PRETTY GOOD

1367
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:36,022
REASON.

1368
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,064
SHE'S BOSSY.

1369
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,108
SHE DOESN'T GET ALONG WITH

1370
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:39,400
EVERYONE.

1371
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,651
I PERSONALLY CARE LESS ABOUT

1372
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,777
THAT THAN OTHERS BECAUSE AS FAR

1373
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,320
AS I'M CONCERNED, THE BIGGEST

1374
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:43,696
THREAT IS DAVID.

1375
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,031
HE'S VERY INTELLIGENT.

1376
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,907
I DO THINK HE'S A SCHEMER, AND

1377
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,533
HE'S ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THAT

1378
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,202
HE WANTS TO GET RID OF ME, SO

1379
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,078
DAVID'S GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1380
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,540
>> I MAY BE BOSSY, BUT I AM

1381
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:54,832
LOYAL.

1382
00:38:54,915 --> 00:39:01,422
>> YOU AND ME, WE'RE GOOD.

1383
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,215
TASHUYOU AND J'TIA GOOD.

1384
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,468
I'M GOING TO TALK TO SPENCER, SO

1385
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,762
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

1386
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,929
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I'M

1387
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,139
ABSOLUTELY SET ON, BUT I THINK

1388
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,391
WE SHOULD JUST PUT FOUR VOTES ON

1389
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:12,600
DAVID.

1390
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,810
>> WELL, WHAT I'M CONCERNED

1391
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,021
ABOUT IS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD

1392
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,397
ANYTHING ABOUT, LIKE, IDOL CLUES

1393
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,857
OR ANYTHING HAVE YOU?

1394
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,484
>> NOTHING.

1395
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,277
>> WELL, IT JUST SEEMS WEIRD

1396
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,153
THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING

1397
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,947
TO DO WITH AN IDOL SO FAR.

1398
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,573
I WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE A

1399
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,824
CLUE SOMEWHERE.

1400
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:29,992
I JUST THINK THAT WOULD BE,

1401
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,535
LIKE, A DAVID IF DAVID FOUND IT.

1402
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,330
>> YEAH.

1403
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,373
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT WITH HIM,

1404
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,666
LIKE SNEAKING OFF OR ANYTHING

1405
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,042
LIKE THAT?

1406
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,586
>> I MEAN, THEY BOTH WENT OFF

1407
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,254
TOGETHER ALONE, AND HE'S PRETTY

1408
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:42,880
SHIFTY, AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

1409
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,175
HE HAS IN HIS BACK POCKET, SO

1410
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:46,384
HELP.

1411
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:46,634
>> RIGHT.

1412
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,510
>> I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

1413
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,136
VOTING OUT DAVID.

1414
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,720
I KNOW IN THE PAST THERE HAVE

1415
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,098
BEEN CLUES AND IDOLS AROUND

1416
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:52,306
CAMP.

1417
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,516
>> AND KEEP SEEING DAVID AND

1418
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,559
KASS WALK OFF AND JUST WARNED

1419
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:55,810
AROUND.

1420
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,520
SO I'M A BIT WORRIED THAT HE

1421
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,396
COULD HAVE FOUND IT.

1422
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,690
SO I'M THINKING SINCE J'TIA IS A

1423
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,484
PAIN IN THE ASS, LET'S VOTE HER

1424
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,985
OUT, JUST TO BE SAFE.

1425
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,278
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A RISK WE

1426
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,446
TONIGHT NEED TO TAKE BECAUSE

1427
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,323
THAT WOULD SUCK IF THEY PLAYED

1428
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:11,367
AN IDOL AND ONE OF US WERE OUT.

1429
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,827
>> SPENCER IS PARANOID ABOUT

1430
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,203
DAVID HAVING THE IDOL WHICH IS

1431
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,538
RIDICULOUS BECAUSE I HAVE THE

1432
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:15,746
IDOL.

1433
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,622
OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO TELL

1434
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,833
HIM THAT, BUT NOW I FEEL NERVOUS

1435
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,458
ABOUT VOTING FOR DAVID BECAUSE

1436
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,128
IT LOOKS LIKE I DON'T HAVE FOUR

1437
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,422
SOLID VOTES FOR TONIGHT.

1438
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,966
>> THE RAIN'S COMING, GUYS.

1439
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:27,174
>> YEAH.

1440
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,385
>> WITHOUT QUESTION, DAVID IS

1441
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,553
JUST A HUGE THREAT.

1442
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,429
AND IF PEOPLE DON'T SEE THAT,

1443
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,848
THEY'RE IDIOTS.

1444
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:34,890
I DON'T KNOW.

1445
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,559
I HOPE THAT SPENCER AND I STAY

1446
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,726
STRONG TOGETHER BUT WE'LL SEE

1447
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,230
WHAT HAPPENS.

1448
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,024
( THUNDER )

1449
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,541
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS

1450
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,251
A TORCH.

1451
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,919
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH,

1452
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,462
APPROACH THE FLAME, DIP IT IN

1453
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,215
AND GET FIRE.

1454
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,675
THIS IS PART RITUAL OF TRIBAL

1455
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,551
COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS GAME,

1456
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,471
FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1457
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,514
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO

1458
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,265
ARE YOU.

1459
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,183
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE FOR

1460
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:24,023
ONE OF YOU TONIGHT.

1461
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,816
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1462
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,110
>> LIKE A BIG SPIDER.

1463
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:28,402
IT'S FINE.

1464
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:29,987
>> Jeff: YOU'RE TELLING ME ALL

1465
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,156
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THESE THREE

1466
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:32,740
DAYS A SPIDER?

1467
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,700
>> IT'S, LIKE, CRAWL ON ME.

1468
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,785
>> Jeff: SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

1469
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,205
THE FIRST FEW DAYS.

1470
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,122
J'TIA, YOU'RE ALREADY SMILING.

1471
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:40,748
>> OH, I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO

1472
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,627
WANT TO TALK TO ME A LOT, JEFF.

1473
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,753
>> Jeff: WHY DO YOU THINK I'M

1474
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,629
GOING TOMENT TO TALK TO YOU A

1475
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:46,795
LOT?

1476
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,797
>> BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE

1477
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,007
CONSIDERING ME FOR THE VOTE

1478
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,257
TONIGHT.

1479
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,509
>> Jeff: AND HERE WE ARE OFF

1480
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,134
AND RUNNING.

1481
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,636
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

I'M AN ENGINEER, I CAME OUT.

1490
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,773

NOBODY LIKES TO BE BOSSED

AROUND, AND THE SHELTER,

1498
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,621

SHE SAID SHE WAS A NUCLEAR

1503
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:28,462
PHYSICIST OR NUCLEAR BOMB

1504
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:29,088
BUILDER OR SOMETHING THAT MADE

AND IT WAS GOING WELL UNTIL IT

1508
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,096
WASN'T GOING WELL ANYMORE.

1509
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,265

1514
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,645
ABOUT IT.

1515
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,772
>> Jeff: J'TIA A MOMENT AGO

00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,024
YOU WERE THE ONE SAYING I KIND

00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,067
OF BLEW IT.

1518
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,735
THE MINUTE DAVID CONFIRMS THAT

00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,279

1520
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,030

I'M BUMMED ABOUT THAT.

00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,533
I'M DOING WHAT I CAN.

1523
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,075
I THINK I'M A RELATIONSHIP

1524
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,868
PERSON, IF I'M TALKING TOO MUCH,

1525
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,662
TELL ME TO SHUT UP.

1526

I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO SUGGESTION.

1527
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,582
I WANT US TO SICK SEED AS A

1528
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:05,791
TRIBE.

00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,375
>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

1530
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,960
EARLY MOMENTS RIGHT OUT OF THE

INSTANTLY YOU PICK GARRET.

1535
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,425
>> I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT

1536
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,843
THE PERFECT POSITION TO BE IN

1537
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,262
AND I DECIDED TO ACT WITH HASTE

1538
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,638
AND NOT DITHER AROUND AND THAT'S

1539
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,389
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

1540
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,308
YOU HAVE TO STEP UP BECAUSE,

>> SUCTION.

1549
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,905
IT IS NEVER FUN TO BE CAST AS

1550
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,032
THE OUTSIDER.

1551
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,575
THAT HAPPENING THREE MINUTES IN

1552
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,117

BEGINNING OF THE GAME WHEN HE

00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,239
SAID,"I'M ALREADY LOOKING DOWN

00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:54,913
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1665
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,665
GOOD NIGHT.

1666
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,417
>> I HAVE NO REGRETS.

1667
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,377
I PLAYED THE WAY I THOUGHT I

1668
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,753
NEED TO PLAY TO GET FORWARD IN

1669
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,296
THE GAME.

1670
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,298
AND THE TRIBE JUST DOESN'T HAVE

1671
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,173
IT TOGETHER.

1672
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,092
OR THEY HAVE IT TOGETHER JUST

1673
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,260
AGAINST ME.

1674
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,137
BUT NO HARD FEELINGS TO ANY OF

1675
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:10,304
THEM.

1676
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,431
I CONSIDER MYSELF PRETTY MUCH

1677
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,098
THE LUCKIEST PERSON IN THE

1678
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:13,390
WORLD.

1679
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,619
>> ANYBODY GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS

1680
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,079
ABOUT THIS FIRE?

1681
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,081
LET'S GET THE PARTY STARTED.

1682
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,751
>> LAST NIGHT, TRIBAL WAS A LOT

1683
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,793
OF RANDOM ARGUING, BUT, YOU

1684
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,004
KNOW, IN THE END, THE REAL POINT

1685
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,130
OF TRIBAL WAS TO SEND DAVID HOME

1686
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,799
AND WE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY

1687
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,717
DO THAT.

1688
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,553
BUT I'M NOT HAVING FUN PLAYING

1689
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:51,845
"SURVIVOR."

1690
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,556
THIS ISN'T FUN FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

1691
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,099
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

1692
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,768
MANUAL LABOR ISN'T FUN.

1693
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,061
STARVING ISN'T FUN.

1694
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,103
LIKE, IT'S NOT LIKE A COOL

1695
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,104
ADVENTURE FOR ME.

1696
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,732
>> JUST REMEMBER, IT'S ALL ABOUT

1697
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:04,733
OXYGEN, SO WHEN YOU BUILD IT,

1698
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,569
MAKE SURE TO GET THE AIR FLOW.

1699
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,987
>> SEPARATE IT A LITTLE BIT.

1700
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:09,196
>> YES.

1701
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,157
>> WHEN I'M PLAYING POKER I'M

1702
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,200
SIT NAIG COMFORTABLE CHAIR.

1703
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,994
CHICK EXPEP VEGETABLES ARE BEING

1704
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,120
BROUGHT TO ME RIGHT AT THE

1705
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:17,329
TABLE.

1706
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,082
I WANT TO PLAY "SURVIVOR" TO

1707
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,833
OUTPLAY AND OUTWIT PEOPLE.

1708
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,294
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY "SURVIVOR"

1709
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,921
TO SURVIVE IN THE WILDERNESS.

1710
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:29,174
LET'S SAY WE HAVE TRIBAL AGAIN

1711
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:29,383
TONIGHT.

1712
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,426
WE GO WITH KASS RIGHT NOW.

1713
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,345
AND WE VOTE OFF ONE OF THE TWO

1714
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:33,679
GIRLS, RIGHT?

1715
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,889
>> TRIBAL WENT PERFECT.

1716
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:36,139
>> RIGHT.

1717
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,558
>> BECAUSE SHE WAS FIGHTING WITH

1718
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,351
TASHA.

1719
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,977
SHE ALREADY DOESN'T LIKE J'TIA.

1720
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,312
SO TRIBAL I THINK MADE US IN A

1721
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,690
BETTER POSITION.

1722
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,608
>> KASS WAS DEFINITELY

1723
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,859
BLINDSIDED BY DAVID GOING HOME

1724
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:48,318
LAST NIGHT.

1725
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,528
SPENCER AND I ARE SETTING

1726
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,321
OURSELVES UP IF WE DO HAVE TO

1727
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,615
VOTE SOMEONE OFF WE HAVE

1728
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,658
OPTIONS.

1729
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,158
J'TIA AND TASHA.

1730
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,704
BUT ALSO IF I FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T

1731
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,329
REALLY TRUST KASS, MAYBE WE JUST

1732
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,789
TAKE HER OUT.

1733
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,415
YOU KNOW, I JUST LIKE WORKING

1734
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,208
WITH THE TWO OF YOU MORE, YOU

1735
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,751
KNOW, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

1736
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:04,960
>> YEAH.

1737
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,169
>> YEAH.

1738
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,965
>> TRIBAL WAS INTERESTING.

1739
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,633
A LITTLE BLINDSIDE OF DAVID AND

1740
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,217
ME.

1741
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,178
BUT ALL I THOUGHT WAS I'M NUMBER

1742
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,597
THREE FOR SOMEONE, AND THEY KNOW

1743
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,098
IT.

1744
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,266
>> I THINK WE SEE THAT IT MAKES

1745
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,059
SENSE FOR YOU TO BE WITH US AND

1746
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,520
IT DEFINITELY MAKES SENSE FOR US

1747
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,396
TO BE WITH YOU.

1748
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,063
>> THE BOYS AREN'T GOINGS TO

1749
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,064
BREAK UP AND THE GIRLS AREN'T

1750
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,483
GOING TO BREAK UP.

1751
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,861
SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAF ME?

1752
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:31,153
SWING VOTE.

1753
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,195
>> I MEAN, FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S

1754
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,990
HAPPENED IN THE PAST, WE HAVE A

1755
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:35,574
SOLID FINAL THREE PACT RIGHT

1756
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:35,741
NOW.

1757
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:36,491
>> YEAH.

1758
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,535
>> AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

1759
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,495
>> I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

1760
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,121
I TALKED TO GARRETT AND SPENCER,

1761
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,165
BUT I'M NOT 100% WITH THEM.

1762
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:46,001
AND I'M GOING TO WORK WHATEVER

1763
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:46,209
ANGLE.

1764
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,086
I HAVE NO ALLEGIANCE RIGHT NOW.

1765
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,464
>> SHAKE ON IT?

1766
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:50,881
FINAL THREE.

1767
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,883
>> WE CAN DO OUR STUPID HANDED

1768
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:53,091
SHAKE.

1769
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:53,717
I DON'T CARE.

1770
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,469
IT'S GAME ON, AS LONG AS IT'S

1771
00:50:55,552 --> 00:51:03,935
NOT ME.

1772
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,103
>> GO GET THEM, FAELS.

1773
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:09,649
>> ALL RIGHT, WOO.

1774
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,068
>> ME AND WOO WE COOPERATE WAIT

1775
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,445
TO TAKE THAT BOAT OUT.

1776
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,488
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT

1777
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,699
BOAT FOR A FEW DAYS NOW.

1778
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,119
JUST ITCHING AT THE BIT TO GO

1779
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,162
OUT THERE AND TRY TO DO SOME

1780
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:22,412
FISHING.

1781
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,331
>> LOOK AT THESE GUYS.

1782
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,248
THEY LOOK LIKE REAL ISLANDERS

1783
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,043
OUT THERE, DON'T THEY.

1784
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,336
>> WE'LL SEE WHAT THEY COME BACK

1785
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,629
WITH.

1786
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:35,133
>> HOW DO-- HOW DO WE TURN

1787
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:35,342
AGAIN?

1788
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,427
>> LEFT TO GO RIGHT.

1789
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,720
YOU WANT TO DOCK IT OVER THERE?

1790
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,430
>> YEAH, LET'S GO SEE WHAT'S

1791
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:40,722
OVER THERE.

1792
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:41,223
>> ALL RIGHT.

1793
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,224
>> I LIKE WOO.

1794
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:46,603
AND YOU GOTTA HAVE A WING BAN.

1795
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,271
BATMAN ALREADY HAD ROBIN.

1796
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,648
JORDAN HAD PIPPIN.

1797
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:53,735
CLIFF HAS WOO.

1798
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,111
WOO TANG.

1799
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,404
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST GOTTA

1800
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,448
TAKE YOUR WING MAN AND DO WHAT

1801
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,284
YOU GOTTA DO TO TAKE CARE OF

1802
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:01,535
BUSINESS.

1803
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:08,458
>> UH-OH!

1804
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,795
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

1805
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:16,341
( LAUGHING )

1806
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,385
>> EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL,

1807
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,178
BUT WE LOST THE-- WE LOST THE

1808
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,555
BALANCE ON THE BOAT, AND ALL OF

1809
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,850
A SUDDEN --

1810
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,393
>> WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR, HELP

1811
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,936
ME TIP THIS?

1812
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,396
IT CAPSIZED, WE GOT A LITTLE

1813
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,856
WATER IN IT.

1814
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:31,690
>> HOW YOU FLIPPING THIS?

1815
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,067
>> I FIGURE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE

1816
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,693
ADVANTAGE OF THE BRAWN THAT'S ON

1817
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,486
THE BEACH AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO

1818
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,905
TIP THE WATER OUT.

1819
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:43,493
>> IT'S COMING OUT, GUYS.

1820
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,245
>> HOW IS THAT?

1821
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:45,412
GOOD.

1822
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,706
>> NO, THERE'S STILL A BUNCH IN

1823
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:47,914
THERE.

1824
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,208
JUST HOLD IT FOR A MINUTE.

1825
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,919
>> CLIFF IS A VERY LIKABLE GUY.

1826
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:53,336
HE'S FUNNY.

1827
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,337
HE HAS A LOT OF CHARISMA, AND I

1828
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,381
WOULD SAY HE'S PROBABLY THE MOST

1829
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,050
LIKED ON OUR TRIBE RIGHT NOW.

1830
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,468
YEAH, YOU DON'T NEED TO GO

1831
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:00,719
HIGHER.

1832
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:01,219
JUST HOLD IT.

1833
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,139
>> I'M LOOKING AT CLIFF, I CAN'T

1834
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,557
TELL YOU FOR A FACT WHAT

1835
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,558
BASKETBALL TEAM HE WAS ON OR

1836
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,059
WHAT HE DID FOR A LIVING OR WHAT

1837
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,352
HE DOES FOR A LIVING BECAUSE I

1838
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:09,769
DON'T REALLY CARE.

1839
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,855
>> OH, MY GOD.

1840
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:12,397
WERE YOU SCARED?

1841
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,940
>> NO, IT WASN'T TOO BAD.

1842
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,775
>> AND THEN WE HAVE LINDZY AND

1843
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,568
SARAH AND WOO.

1844
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,694
APPARENTLY THEY LOVE HIM.

1845
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,362
THEY'RE, LIKE, FANS OF HIM.

1846
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,281
>> I HONESTLY LOVE CLIFF.

1847
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,407
I THINK HE'S FANTASTIC.

1848
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:22,949
I REALLY DO.

1849
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:23,700
>> THIS IS A GAME.

1850
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,619
I UNDERSTAND HOW THE GAME IS

1851
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:25,827
PLAYED.

1852
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,453
I'VE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE I'M

1853
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,955
AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON.

1854
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:40,592
>> OUR FIRST MISSION-- FAIL.

1855
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,349
>> TODAY IS DEFINITELY BEAUTIFUL

1856
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,267
ON A BEAUTIFUL TRIBE, BUT

1857
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,936
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE PLAYING

1858
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,355
DUMB OUT HERE, AND I'M ON TO IT.

1859
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,648
ALEXIS IS JUST BEING THE FLIRT

1860
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,275
OUT HERE.

1861
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,361
JUST KIND OF, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

1862
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,487
DEFINITELY ALL ABOUT HER

1863
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,656
SEXUALITY AND ALWAYS IN HER

1864
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:06,910
PANTIES, KIND OF LIKE, "YOU WANT

1865
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,578
SOME COCONUT WATER?"

1866
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,872
SO I DEFINITELY SEE HER GAME.

1867
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,040
JEFRA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER

1868
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:12,457
GAME IT.

1869
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,126
>> ARE YOU ALL URINATING A LOT.

1870
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,670
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT POOPING, BUT

1871
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,963
ARE YOU BEING?

1872
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,215
MAYBE ONCE A DAY SO THAT CANNOT

1873
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:20,590
BE GOOD FOR US.

1874
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:25,220
>> ALL OF HER CRAYONS ON CRAYON

1875
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,388
BOX ARE NOT BRIGHT.

1876
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,682
>> YOU LOOK CUTE IN YOUR BOWLING

1877
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:28,890
SOCKS.

1878
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,142
>> I ONLY SEE HIM AS A FRIEND IN

1879
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,769
MY EYES BUT HE MIGHT SEE ME AS

1880
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:33,144
SOMETHING MORE.

1881
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,563
SO I THINK IF I NEEDED TO, I

1882
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,607
COULD DEFINITELY REEL HIM IN,

1883
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,651
AND HE WOULD BE RIGHT THERE IN

1884
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:40,360
MY BACK POCKET.

1885
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,113
I'M FROM, LIKE, THE SILICON

1886
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,864
VALLEY, SO IT'S ALL REALLY TECH

1887
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:48,576
AND, LIKE, ENGINEERS.

1888
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,369
THOSE NERD TRIBE WOULD LOVE

1889
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,121
WHERE I LIVE.

1890
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,372
>> JEREMIAH HAS BEEN DROOLING

1891
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,415
OVER MORGAN AND ME BEING THE

1892
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,084
ULTIMATE WING MAN, I CAN

1893
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,127
FACILITATE FOR HIM TO KIND OF

1894
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,503
GET TO WORK WITH MORGAN AND BE

1895
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,506
AROUND THE HOT GIRL.

1896
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,382
>> DOES JEFRA GET ON YOUR NERVES

1897
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,050
AT ALL?

1898
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,594
>> HECK, YEAH.

1899
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,471
>> I JUST SIT HERE SMILING.

1900
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,389
>> I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO BE,

1901
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,558
LIKE THE BRAINS, THE OPERATION.

1902
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:11,766
>> YEAH.

1903
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:16,604
>> UH-HUH.

1904
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,065
>> I MEAN, IF Y'ALL WILL TRUST

1905
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:19,315
ME--

1906
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,359
>> US COUNTRY FOLK HAVE TO STICK

1907
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:21,609
TOGETHER.

1908
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:25,030
I THINK WHEN MY TRIBE FIRST MET

1909
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:25,655
ME, THEY KIND OF THOUGHT I WOULD

1910
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,866
BE THE FOURTH GIRL ON THE TRIBE

1911
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:28,533
JUST LAYING OUT ALL DAY.

1912
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,578
DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.

1913
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:40,045
I'M PLAYING THE GAME.

1914
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,382
>> ARE ANY OF THOSE SEMIDRY,

1915
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:44,591
TRISH?

1916
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,842
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?

1917
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,469
>> THERE'S PLENTY OF WOOD TO BE

1918
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,512
HAD IF YOU WANT TO GO GRAB SOME,

1919
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:49,763
LINDSEY.

1920
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,806
THERE'S PLENTY OF WOOD UP THERE.

1921
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,099
>> IS THERE, LIKE, AN ISSUE?

1922
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:53,641
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE HAVING AN

1923
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,560
ISSUE WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

1924
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,937
>> NO, I'M JUST SAYING WE COULD

1925
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,398
HAVE FIRE IF-- WE NEED TO HAVE

1926
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,900
FIRE FOR THE NEXT 39 DAYS.

1927
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,526
WE NEED AS MUCH WOOD AS WE

1928
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,152
POSSIBLY CAN.

1929
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,570
>> WHY IS IT ME, THOUGH?

1930
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:05,945
WHY IS IT ON ME?

1931
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,989
>> WELL, WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

1932
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:08,656
CHIP IN.

1933
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:08,948
>> EXACTLY.

1934
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:13,620
SO WHY AM I NOT CHIPPING IN?

1935
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,914
>> LEAVE HER ALONE.

1936
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,083
NOW TRICIA, SHE NEEDS TO CHILL

1937
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,085
OUT BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND HER

1938
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:20,293
VOICE.

1939
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,920
I CAN'T STAND HER ATTITUDE.

1940
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:22,545
I CAN'T STAND THE FACT THAT

1941
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,382
SHE'S SO JUDGMENTAL.

1942
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,176
LINDSEY, I JUST WISH WE COULD

1943
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,260
JUST CONTRIBUTE LIKE EVERYBODY

1944
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:29,469
ELSE.

1945
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,637
I JUST WANT YOU TO CONTRIBUTE.

1946
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,513
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

1947
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:31,805
OH, MY GOSH.

1948
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:36,101
I CANNOT STAND HER.

1949
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,894
>> WHAT'S UP, TRISH, YOU ALL

1950
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:38,103
RIGHT?

1951
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,021
>> SHE'S JUST SITTING DOWN

1952
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,689
THERE, KISSING CLIFF'S ASS.

1953
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,232
>> LISTEN--

1954
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,358
>> I THINK EVERYBODY IS STARTING

1955
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,901
TO SEE WHAT I SEE, HOW LINDSEY

1956
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,444
DOESN'T HELP OUT AT ALL, AND HOW

1957
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,987
ANNOYING SHE CAN BE AROUND CAMP.

1958
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,156
I'M FROM BOSTON, MASS.

1959
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,033
SHE HASN'T MET ME YET.

1960
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,701
BECAUSE IF I REALLY SNAPPED ON

1961
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,245
HER, SHE'D STILL BE CRYING.

1962
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,038
RIGHT NOW.

1963
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,040
>> LINDSEY'S IN LOVE WITH CLIFF

1964
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,458
BECAUSE OF I HAD BASKETBALL

1965
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,042
ABILITIES AND WHATEVER IT IS,

1966
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,044
AND I'VE GOT YOUR BACK, ALL

1967
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:03,586
RIGHT.

1968
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,046
I'M ALL YOU'VE GOT, AND YOU'RE

1969
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,172
ALL I'VE GOT.

1970
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:06,840
I TRUST TRISH.

1971
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,007
SHE'S A GENUINE PERSON.

1972
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,302
SHE'S OUT THERE BUSTING HER ASS,

1973
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:11,845
TOO, WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IS

1974
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,346
FULL OF DRAMA.

1975
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,013
YOU'RE A SWEETHEART BUT YOU HAVE

1976
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,390
TO BE STRONG OUT HERE.

1977
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:15,723
>> I'M STRONG.

1978
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,184
>> DON'T LET THEM WEASEL THEIR

1979
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,769
WAY IN YOUR LADY AND TELL YOU

1980
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,271
THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON.

1981
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:21,729
IT'S NOT.

1982
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,690
I'LL TELL YOU LATER WHAT I'M

1983
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,151
WORK WORKING ON OVER THERE.

1984
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,195
TRISH AND I ARE WALKING ON

1985
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,363
EGGSHELLS WITH THESE PEOPLE AND

1986
00:57:30,446 --> 00:57:32,031
THAT'S WHERE I CAME UP WITH THE

1987
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,074
IDEA OF SPYING ON THEM.

1988
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,826
I ACT LIKE I'M TRYING TO PROTECT

1989
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,661
THEM FROM THE RAIN AND

1990
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,413
EVERYTHING BUT I'LLING ABOUT A

1991
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:38,872
SPY SHACK.

1992
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:39,581
I'M TRYING TO COVER UP A

1993
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,374
CUBBYHOLE IN THE CORNER AND I'M

1994
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:43,251
GOING TO RUN AROUND THE BEACH

1995
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,669
AND CRAWL UP TO HERE AND LISTEN

1996
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,962
TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY AND I'M

1997
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,255
GOING TO HEAR EVERYTHING.

1998
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,757
SO WHATEVER USELESS CLIFF TELLS

1999
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,342
WEASEL WOO, THAT'S CRUCIAL

2000
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:51,634
INFORMATION.

2001
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,343
THAT'S THE KEY TO THIS.

2002
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,553
IT'S NOT JUST SMALL TALK.

2003
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,888
IT'S GOING TO BE BIG TALK.

2004
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,556
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

2005
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,600
MY MAIN TARGET IS CLIFF, THE

2006
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,226
LION, THE PRIDE.

2007
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,269
IN ORDER TO TAKE OVER THE PRIDE,

2008
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,562
THE OTHER LION HAS TO COME IN

2009
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,314
AND KILL THAT ONE.

2010
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,316
AND THEN HE HAS TO KILL THE

2011
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:06,608
CUBS.

2012
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,027
I HAVE MORE BRAIN THAN BRAWN.

2013
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:09,986
LITTLE DO THEY KNOW.

2014
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:39,766
>> BRAWNS AND BEAUTY, GETTING

2015
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,644
YOUR FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW BRAIN

2016
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:43,603
TRIBE.

2017
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,563
DAVID VOTED OUT AT THE FIRST

2018
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,942

>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

2023
00:58:53,738 --> 00:59:01,788
I'LL TAKE BACK THE IDOLS.

2024
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,539
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

2025
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,501

THIS IS GOOD STUFF.

2307
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,228
THE FIRST THING THAT POPPED INTO

2308
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,355
MY MIND THERE HAS TO BE SOME

2309
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,398
KIND OF IDOL OR CLUE TO AN IDOL

2310
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:40,282
THERE THAT BASKET.

2311
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,788
I OPENED UP THE WOODEN TACKLE

2312
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,581
BOX, AND I SEE A LITTLE PIECE

2313
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,333
OF-- A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER IN

2314
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:49,542
THERE.

2315
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,126
SO WHEN I WENT BACK INTO THE

2316
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,294
BASKET, I TOOK IT OUT AND PUT IT

2317
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,338
IN MY POCKET, AND THIS IS WHAT

2318
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,006
IT LOOKS LIKE.

2319
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,300

I DON'T NEED TO TELL ANYBODY

2359
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:30,476
ABOUT THE IDOL.

2360
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:31,268
IT'S NOT GOING TO BENEFIT ME IN

2361
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,646
ANY WAY TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT

2362
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:34,563
THE IDOL.

2363
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,523

I MEAN, SHE BACKSTROKED ALL THE

2394
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,720
WAY BACK WHILE WE WERE PULLING

2395
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:47,970
THE STUFF.

2396
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:52,683
AND THEN THE PUZ PUZZLE.

2397
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,309
I MEAN, THERE WASN'T ONE

2398
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:55,477
CONTRIBUTION TO THE CHALLENGE IN

2399
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:55,769
ANY ASPECT.

2400
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,521
I'M JUST BEING HONEST.

2401
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:58,731
>> SPENCER, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

2402
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:02,276
>> I MEAN, YEAH, IT MAKES SENSE.

2403
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:03,652
ARE WE JUST, LIKE, HAVING AN

2404
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:04,695
OPEN FORUM RIGHT NOW?

2405
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,238
>> I THINK WE SHOULD TALK.

2406
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,364
>> I THINK WE SHOULD BE OPEN

2407
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:09,408
ABOUT IT, YEAH, AS OPPOSED TO-

2408
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:13,871
>> I MEAN, WE DO NEED TO WIN.

2409
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:14,079
GARRETT?

2410
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:19,084
>> YEAH, I AGREE.

2411
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,252
TASHA?

2412
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:21,003
>> YEAH, I STILL KIND OF JUST

2413
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,546
WANT TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND--

2414
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,965
JUST INDIVIDUALLY BECAUSE, YOU

2415
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,383
KNOW, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE

2416
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,552
BEING AS CANDID AS POSSIBLE.

2417
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,346
>> LOOK, MY VOTE IS TO, LIKE,

2418
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:35,267
NOT HAVE SIDE CONVOS, HONESTLY.

2419
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,268
THAT IS WHAT I WOULD PREFER.

2420
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,103
>> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE "SURVIVOR"

2421
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,605
AND NOW THAT I'M HERE IT'S

2422
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:40,522
FRUSTRATING TO PLAY WITH PEOPLE

2423
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,317
THAT DON'T WANT TO PLAY THE

2424
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:43,525
GAME.

2425
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,402
YOU KNOW, I LOOKED FORWARD TO

2426
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:48,572
SCHEMING AND BACKSTABBING, BUT

2427
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:51,408
APPARENTLY, I'M BEING TOLD NO.

2428
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,160
IT SADDENS ME.

2429
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:54,661
>> BEST CASE, I THINK, IS THE

2430
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:55,621
FIVE OF US SIT HERE TOGETHER

2431
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:58,123
UNTIL TRIBAL.

2432
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:58,624
WE EAT DINNER--

2433
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,334
>> I NEED TO TALK TO YOU TWO.

2434
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:01,043
THAT'S THE ONLY SIDE

2435
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:01,835
CONVERSATION I NEED TO HAVE.

2436
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,670
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED TO

2437
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:04,630
TALK SEPARATELY.

2438
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,256
IT'S ALL BEEN-- IT'S ALL OUT IN

2439
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,049
THE OPEN.

2440
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:07,549
>> THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

2441
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,426
LIKE, YOU GO TALK.

2442
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,512
>> I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT

2443
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:11,762
ANYMORE.

2444
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:12,012
I DON'T--

2445
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,598
>> THEN QUIT!

2446
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:18,769
JUST-- THIS IS-- I MEAN, IT'S--

2447
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:22,731
THIS IS, LIKE, THE LEAST

2448
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,650
STRATEGIC GAME I HAVE EVER

2449
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:24,983
PLAYED.

2450
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,445
I DON'T KNOW WHY GARRETT THINKS

2451
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,072
HE IS THE AUTHORITY AT LUZON.

2452
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:32,950
HE IS THE NOTHE LEADER AT THIS

2453
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:33,158
TRIBE.

2454
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,119
HE LAYS AROUND ALL DAY, PRETTY

2455
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:36,620
MUCH WATCHES EVERYONE WORK.

2456
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:37,496
HE'S ALWAYS HUNGRY, AND NOW HE

2457
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,581
DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO PLAY THE

2458
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:39,790
GAME.

2459
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:41,333
IT'S JUST-- IT'S SILLY.

2460
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:42,751
IT'S REALLY SILLY.

2461
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:47,089
IT'S REALLY SILLY.

2462
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:48,882
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

2463
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,134
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY THE

2464
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:52,970
GAME HOW IT SHOULD BE PLAYED,

2465
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,012
GET-- GET OUT OF HERE!

2466
01:13:54,096 --> 01:14:02,271
GET OUT OF HERE " OF HERE.

2467
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,531
>> SO MY TRIBE SAT ME DOWN AND

2468
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,825
TOLD ME, SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE.

2469
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,285
WELL, WE'VE BEEN REVIEWING YOUR

01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,162

NO, NO, NO I'M NOT-- I'LL JUST

2473
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,166
TELL YOU FROM THE WHOLE COMPANY.

2474
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:22,666
YEAH, RIGHT.

2475
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:25,335
WHAT IN MY PERSONALITY MADE YOU

2476
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:27,004
THINK THAT WAS GOING TO WORK?

2477
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:27,588
>> IT'S JUST NOT ABOUT TODAY.

2478
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:30,215
IT'S ABOUT THE NEXT THREE DAYS,

2479
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:30,591
AND THE--

2480
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:32,259
>> THE NEXT THREE TASE WE'RE

2481
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:33,677
GOING TO HAVE A GREAT CAMP AND

2482
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,720
WIN A CHALLENGE.

2483
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,847
>> YOU'LL WIN ALL THE CHALLENGES

2484
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,390
BACK TO BACK AND NEVER HAVE TO

2485
01:14:38,473 --> 01:14:40,559
GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL AGAIN.

2486
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,895
>> CAN'T EVEN STRATEGIZE.

2487
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,521
>> LIKE, THE "SURVIVOR" GENIUS

2488
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:47,316
HE IS, GARRETT DECIDES TO HAVE

2489
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:49,401
AN OPEN FORUM ON WHAT WE'RE

2490
01:14:49,484 --> 01:14:50,652
GOING TO DO LATER AT TRIBAL

2491
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:51,195
COUNCIL.

2492
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,404
GARRETT, YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

2493
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:53,572
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

2494
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:57,326
YOU'RE A FIRST-CLASS, GRADE-A

2495
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:58,827
MORON IN "SURVIVOR."

2496
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,329
WHY WOULD DO YOU THAT?

2497
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:01,371
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY TO

2498
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:02,539
TELL J'TIA WHAT SHE WANTS TO

2499
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:05,542
HEAR, BUT NOW THAT GARRETT PUT

2500
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,336
IT OUT IN THE OPEN WE HAVE TO

2501
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,505
BABY SIT THESE GIRLS AND MAKE

2502
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:12,758
SURE THEY GO HOME.

2503
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,431
>> HEY, IF THEY DON'T WANT TO

2504
01:15:19,514 --> 01:15:20,057
SCRAMBLE, I'M GOING TO SCRAMBLE

2505
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,892
AND TRY TO TWIST THIS GAME UP.

2506
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:23,685
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT TRYING TO GO

2507
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:24,353
HOME NEXT.

2508
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:25,354
>> THINK ABOUT IT.

2509
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:27,731
IT'S ONE AND TWO.

2510
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:29,900
EITHER I'M THREE OR FOUR OR

2511
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:30,776
YOU'RE THREE OR FOUR.

2512
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,444
I NEED TO WORK MY WAY TO THE

2513
01:15:32,527 --> 01:15:32,611
TOP.

2514
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,404
WHY CAN'T I BE TOP DOG?

2515
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:36,323
I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN?

2516
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:48,126
I'M TELLING YOU, ONE AND TWO.

2517
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:01,723
TODAY IS THE ONLY DAY WE HAVE

2518
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:06,144
THE NUMBERS.

2519
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:06,311
KASS.

2520
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:09,064
THINK ABOUT IT.

2521
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:11,358
>> HEY, GUYS.

2522
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:13,944
>> HAY, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE

2523
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,946
J'TIA ALONE.

2524
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:17,739
GOD KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING

2525
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:17,948
THERE.

2526
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:19,157
>> SHE PISSED.

2527
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,202
>> SOMEBODY NEEDS TO WATCH HER.

2528
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,620
>> WHO KNOWS WHAT SHENAN GRANS

2529
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:24,746
GOING ON?

2530
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:28,709
>> THERE ARE NO SHENANIGANS.

2531
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,502
>> I DON'T MIND FTHAT'S WHAT IT

2532
01:16:30,585 --> 01:16:35,966
HAS TO COME TO, I'M DOWN FOR IT.

2533
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:37,467
I'M COMING IN HOT.

2534
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,553
IT'S GOING TO BE GUNS TBLAIZING.

2535
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:41,722
I'M COMING IN LIKE A CRAZY

2536
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:41,972
PERSON.

2537
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:44,349
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE GUARDING ME.

2538
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:44,891
I'M LIKE THE MENTAL PATIENT.

2539
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:48,103
AND THEY LEFT THE MENTAL PATIENT

2540
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:52,691
ALONE AND SHE WENT CRAZY!

2541
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:53,734
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

2542
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:57,070
LEAVE CRAZY PEOPLE ALONE.

2543
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:57,863
>> WE DON'T HAVE ANY WATER IN

2544
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,698
ANY OF THE BOTTLES?

2545
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:00,782
>> NOTHING.

2546
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:12,169
>> THINK ABOUT IT.

2547
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:15,505
>> WHERE DID ALL THAT RICE COME

2548
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:15,714
FROM?

2549
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:16,923
WHO POURED RICE ON THE FIRE?

2550
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,675
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2551
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:19,051
>> THE RICE FAIRY?

2552
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,594
>> I DON'T UPON.

2553
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:21,636
>> THERE'S RICE ON THE FIRE.

2554
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,681
>> HELLO!

2555
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,309
>> IS THAT ALL THE RICE?

2556
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:31,813
>> WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE DID.

2557
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:32,731
>> IT'S ALL GONE.

2558
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:33,857
>> I CANNOT--

2559
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,276
>> THIS RICE IS, LIKE, ALMOST

2560
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,819
ALL GONE.

2561
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:40,238
J'TIA WAS SOMEWHAT SUBDUED WHEN

2562
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,907
WE ALL BEHIND WNT DOWN TO THE

2563
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,450
BEACH WHEN WAS A MISTAKE AND

01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:47,412
THEN SHE DUMPED OUR RICE OUT AND

2565
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,955
NOW WE HAVE NO RICE.

2566
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,332
I'VE HAD SUCH A HARD TIME OUT

2567
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,292
HERE ALREADY, IT JUST BRINGS ME

2568
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:55,087

2569
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:55,295
LOOK.

2570
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:55,545
GARRETT.

2571
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:56,421
ALL OF OUR RICE.

2572
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,548
>> I WANTED US ALL TO STAY

2573
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:02,761

2574
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:03,929
>> HOW DID WE COME UP WITH THE

2575
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:04,763
CRITERIA FOR BRAINS?

2576
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:08,183
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT DATA.

2577
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:10,519
BECAUSE, UH, IRONICALLY, I WAS

2578
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,521
GOING TO APPROACH J'TIA ABOUT

2579
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:13,772
TURNING THIS AROUND.

2580
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,732
BUT THEN I GET BACK TO CAMP, AND

2581
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:17,692
SHE JUST POURED ALL OF OUR RICE

2582
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:18,402
ON THE FIRE.

2583
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,778
I CAN'T ALIGN WITH SOMEONE LIKE

2584
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:24,366
THAT.

2585
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:44,803
>> Jeff: TRIBAL COUNCIL NUMBER

2586
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:45,846
TWO.

2587
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,765
THE LOOKS ON YOUR FACES RIGHT

2588
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:48,932
NOW.

2589
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:50,684
SPENCER, WHAT HAPPENED?

2590
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,227
>> AFTER THE CHALLENGE, WE

2591
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,895
DECIDE TO HAVE AN OPEN FORUM

2592
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:57,357
DISCUSSION OF THE VOTE-OUT,

2593
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:59,651
WHICH IS USUALLY NOT WHAT YOU DO

2594
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:00,777
IN "SURVIVOR."

2595
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:01,820
>> Jeff: SO TELL ME ABOUT THE

2596
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,280
DISCUSSION, TASHA.

2597
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,615
>> YOU KNOW, WE WERE PRETTY

2598
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,659
CAPPEDID ABOUT WHERE WE LOST THE

2599
01:19:07,742 --> 01:19:07,909
CHALLENGE.

2600
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,661
>> Jeff: AND WAS THAT BLAME

2601
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:09,828
J'TIA.

2602
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,872
>> YEAH, I SUGGESTED HEY,

2603
01:19:11,955 --> 01:19:13,665
SPENCER, HEY, GARRETT, CAN WE

2604
01:19:13,748 --> 01:19:14,416
JUST GO TALK.

2605
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:15,834
BUT THEN GARRETT MADE THE

2606
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,252
SUGGESTIONS, NO, LET'S ALL JUST

2607
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:17,961
TALK RIGHT HERE.

2608
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:23,216
>> Jeff: GARRETT YWHY HAVE

2609
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,135
THIS OPEN DISCUSSION?

2610
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:27,053
WHAT IS THE BASIS FOR THAT?

2611
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:29,264
>> I WANTED KASS TON WE WERE

2612
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:30,515
ANYTHING TO BE WORK HER, AND I

2613
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,559
WANTED HER TO SAY THAT WE WERE

2614
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:34,102
GOING TO VOTE WITH J'TIA AND WE

2615
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,772
WERE WITH KASS AND THAT WOULD

2616
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:38,231
CALM HER NERVES.

2617
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:42,027
>> I ASKED WHY GARRETT GOT TO

2618
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,279
CALL ALL THE SHOTS AND I THREW

2619
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:44,738
THE RICE IN THE FIRE.

2620
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:45,071
>> Jeff: WOW.

2621
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:46,615
ALL THE RICE?

2622
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:47,324
>> MOST OF IT.

2623
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,074
>> JUST ABOUT.

2624
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:48,909
>> LIKE, LITERALLY, 98% OF IT.

2625
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:51,661
>> YEAH, NOT MY BEST MOMENT.

2626
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:52,120
NOT AT ALL.

2627
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,955
>> BUT, JEFF, I CAN ADD, THAT'S

2628
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:54,873
WHY I WANTED TO HAVE THE

2629
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:57,501
CONVERSATION PRIVATELY.

2630
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:58,418
SHE'S VOLATILE.

2631
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,128
I KNEW THAT WE WERE HEADING DOWN

2632
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,338
THE WRONG TRACK WITH THIS ONE.

2633
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:02,297
>> Jeff: YOU GUYS ARE

2634
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,215
RESPONSIBLE FOR TELLING HER SHE

2635
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,467
WAS GOING HOME.

2636
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,761
THERE'S A REASON BLINDSIDES

2637
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:07,969
WORK.

2638
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,429
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE FUN.

2639
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:10,305
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE EFFECTIVE.

2640
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:12,015
>> THE ONLY THING GOING OUT AND

2641
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:13,642
HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

2642
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:15,936
IT DOES IS PUT OUR "SURVIVOR"

2643
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:16,811
GAME AT STAKE.

2644
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:18,855
I WAS NEVER TRYING TO MASTERMIND

2645
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:19,105
ANYTHING.

2646
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:22,234
>> BASICALLY, YOU PUT ME OVER

2647
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,778
YOUR KNEE AND SPANKED MY ASS IN

2648
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:25,278
FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

2649
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,571
>> THAT'S WILDLY UNTRUE.

2650
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:26,780
>> OKAY.

2651
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:28,240
>> AT THIS POINT, SHE'S GOING

2652
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,032
HOME, AND SHE DESTROYS 98% OF

2653
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:33,203
OUR RICE, AND BY PAINTING ME IN

2654
01:20:33,286 --> 01:20:35,956
A NEGATIVE LIGHT IN FRONT OF MY

2655
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,542
TRIBE MATES IS VERY UNFAIR.

2656
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:39,626
>> Jeff: KASS, WHERE DO YOU

2657
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:40,544
FALL ON THIS?

2658
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:42,837
YOU HEARD TWO SIDES NOW, J'TIA

2659
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:43,338
AND GARRETT?

2660
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:46,049
>> JEFF, THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL SO

2661
01:20:46,132 --> 01:20:46,299
PARANOID.

2662
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,469
I WAS DOWN AT THE WATER WITH

2663
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:50,095
TASHA WASHING OUR FEET AFTER THE

2664
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:53,056
CHALLENGE AND GATOR WAS SO

2665
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:53,932
PARANOID HE CAME DOWN TO THE

2666
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,016
WATER AND THEN THE RICE GOT

2667
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,476
POURED OUT.

2668
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,352
>> THAT'S NOT FAIR.

2669
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:57,978
>> IT'S THE RICE AND IT'S GONE.

2670
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:00,230
>> IF YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE

2671
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:01,231
A TALK RIGHT BEFORE TRIBAL

2672
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:02,774
COUNCIL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO

2673
01:21:02,857 --> 01:21:03,275
JUST SIT THERE.

2674
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,527
>> WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT, 30

2675
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,987
DAYS' WORTH OF RICE OR WATCHING

2676
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,781
US WASH OUR FEET?

2677
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:10,115
>> Jeff: WOW.

2678
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,200
>> JEFF, I FEEL LIKE MY GAME IS

2679
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,577
BEING STIFLED RIGHT NOW,

2680
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,327
LITERALLY STIFLED.

2681
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,663
HOW CAN YOU PLAY "SURVIVOR" WHEN

2682
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:18,081
YOU CAN'T HAVE CONVERSATIONS?

2683
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:20,125
>> TASHA WAS UTSET TODAY BECAUSE

2684
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,335
J'TIA WAS HER CLOSEST ALLY.

2685
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:23,587
IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

2686
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,006
YOU CAN ASK THE OTHERS IN THE

2687
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:27,841
ALLIANCE-- I'M SORRY, IN THE

2688
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:28,049
TRIBE.

2689
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,676
SO WE WANT J'TIA TOOK.

2690
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:31,011
OF COURSE THAT'S GOING TO UPSET

2691
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:31,177
HER.

2692
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,429
>> Jeff: KASS, YOU CHUCKLED

2693
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:34,973
WHEN HE SAID "ALLIANCE" AND

2694
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,183
FIXED IT BY SAYING "TRIBE."

2695
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,560
>> BECAUSE I'M NOT IN THE

2696
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:38,810
ALLIANCE.

2697
01:21:38,893 --> 01:21:40,604
>> YOU DON'T THINK YOU, SPENCER,

2698
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:43,148
AND I WORKED OUT AN ALLIANCE ON

2699
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:43,565
DAY FOUR.

2700
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:44,441
>> OH, YOU'RE OUT.

2701
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:46,818
>> NOW I'M OUT.

2702
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:47,152
>> Jeff: WOW.

2703
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:49,779
>> SO IT IS FLEXIBLE.

2704
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,740
AND GARRETT DECIDES WHO'S IN AND

2705
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:51,906
OUT.

2706
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,407
>> Jeff: SO IF I HAVE IT

2707
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:56,036
RIGHT, THE WAY IT SITS NOW IS

2708
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:58,121
IT'S GARRETT, KASS, AND SPENCER

2709
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:00,540
IN AN ALLIANCE.

2710
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:02,792
J'TIA AND TASHA ARE IN TROUBLE.

2711
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:03,335
J'TIA IS PROBABLY GOING HOME

2712
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:03,585
TONIGHT.

2713
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:05,003
>> I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY AT

2714
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:05,170
ALL.

2715
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:06,129
>> Jeff: ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU

2716
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:07,797
JUST SAID?

2717
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,799
>> IF J'TIA GOES HOME.

2718
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,260
WE HAVE FOUR PLAYERS, ALL OF

2719
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:12,969
WHOM CAN BE ONE STRONG TEAM.

2720
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,680
>> Jeff: MAYBE I'M

2721
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,264
MALNOURISHED, SPENCER, AM I

2722
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:16,473
WRONG?

2723
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:19,517
>> YOU'RE NOT WRONG, THAT'S

2724
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,894
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

2725
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:22,687
>> WHEN KASS CAME TO SPENCER AND

2726
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:23,980
I AND SAID, "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

2727
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,565
BE ABLE TO BREAK YOU WANT GIRLS,

2728
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:26,942
AND SPENCER AND I THOUGHT, OKAY,

2729
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:27,442
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

2730
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:29,110
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE

2731
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:29,903
GOING TO DO.

2732
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:31,446
BUT WHEN J'TIA FAILED AT THE

2733
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:33,740
PUZZLE IN THE CHALLENGE, THE

2734
01:22:33,823 --> 01:22:35,116
DECISION BECAME CLEAR WHAT WE

2735
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:35,533
SHOULD DO.

2736
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,577
>> Jeff: NOW, KASS, GARRETT

2737
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:38,828
HAS JUST SAID YOU WENT TO HIM

2738
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:39,454
AND SPENCER AND SAID LET'S BREAK

2739
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:44,709
YOU WANT WOMEN AND FORM OUR OWN

2740
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:45,794
ALLIANCE TRUE OR FALSE?

2741
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:47,879
>> GARRETT SAID THAT.

2742
01:22:47,962 --> 01:22:49,089
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT DOWN.

2743
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:50,173
>> Jeff: HOW DO YOU TRUST

2744
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:50,382
GARRETT?

2745
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:54,094
>> HOW DO YOU TRUST ANYBODY?

2746
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:57,347
>> I'M OUT OF THE ALLIANCE, IT'S

2747
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:57,597
NOT TRUE.

2748
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:00,141
WE NEEDED TO SPLIT YOU UP,

2749
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:01,476
TASHA, THAT'S ALL.

2750
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:02,060
THE FOUR OF US ARE ALL EQUAL.

2751
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:04,396
>> WHICH FOUR?

2752
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,606
>> Jeff: MAN, NECESSARY NUTS.

2753
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,400
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS ABOUT

2754
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:09,192
TO HAPPEN BUT IT'S BEEN VERY
