00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,460
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,088
<i>Survivor...</i> Sandra approached
Darrah about making

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,425
an all-girl alliance.
>> I want the guys to go.

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,218
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> Burton is a bigger threat

5
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,430
than Jon, because Jon is just
like a girl.

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,432
>> PROBST: At the reward
challenge, the Survivors

7
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,435
competed in teams of three.
Sandra took a chinner

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,272
on the platform, and Lill,
Darrah and Jon won the reward.

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,775
Lill, Darrah, Jon--
overnight spa reward!

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,987
And they were off on a scenic
flight to a luxury spa.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,489
>> This could be the best reward
in the history of the game.

12
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,575
>> PROBST: The three enjoyed
first-class service.

13
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,952
>> Oh, baby.
>> PROBST: And Jon continued to

14
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,246
play up his dead grandmother
lie.

15
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,291
>> And I told them that one of
her last wishes was that I win.

16
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,669
>> PROBST: After returning to
camp, Lill sought reassurance

17
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,464
from Burton about their
alliance.

18
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,008
>> You're telling me now that
you have second thoughts?

19
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,427
>> I have never promised her
top two.

20
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,929
>> PROBST: At the immunity
challenge, Darrah's steady aim

21
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,516
won her immunity for the
second time in a row.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,603
Once again, Darrah wins
immunity.

23
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,397
Before Tribal Council,
Christa and Sandra believed

24
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,650
Lill would be the one to go.
>> So, Lill, is it tonight?

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,028
>> I just want to make sure
everybody was on the same sheet

26
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,780
of music.
>> PROBST: But, in the end,

27
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,283
Darrah and Lill joined the guys
and voted out Sandra's old ally.

28
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:20,121
Christa, the tribe has spoken.
Five are left.

29
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:26,836
Who will be voted out tonight?

NETWORK TELEVISION
(thunder roaring)

33
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,077
>> So, before you cuss me out
tonight, Sandra, Christa

34
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,248
offered you up all day long.
She said, as long as you're

35
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,293
here, she'll never get
to enjoy a reward.

36
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,545
And you refuse to accept
that this is a one-person,

37
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,381
not a two-player game.
>> Last Tribal Council,

38
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,259
another blindside.
Chalk another one up

39
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,762
for Jon and me. Uh...
Christa didn't see it coming.

40
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,141
Um... just out of nowhere,
she was voted out.

41
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,602
Beautiful thing is that's
three in a row.

42
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,771
>> So she asked that we switch
it from Lill to you all day

43
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,732
long.
>> I guess I can't complain,

44
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,860
huh?
I got three more days, right?

45
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,779
>> Sandra's clueless in the fact
that she's positive she's going

46
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,116
next, and it's not true.
She's a much weaker competitor

47
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,660
than D.
Sandra probably feels about

48
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,787
as vulnerable as possible,
and, uh...

49
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,122
I want her to keep feeling
that way.

50
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:39,552
(thunder roaring)
>> Today is day 34 and, um...

51
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm not feeling too good,
because of the fact that

52
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,308
now Christa's gone,
and I know I'm vulnerable.

53
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,852
I know my days are numbered.
>> I'm just thinking of things

54
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,146
we need to do-- like, probably
boil water, probably get

55
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,315
firewood.
So, who's going to go get

56
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,317
mussels with me?
>> Lill.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,487
>> Jon, Burton, Lill and
Darrah, they all deceived, so

58
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,200
now I'm working on my revenge.
My plan right now is to start on

59
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,620
the two water cans.
I'm going to hide those,

60
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,497
I'm going to hide the nets,
'cause they haven't used them

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,499
in a long time.
Lord, give me the strength

62
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,960
to make it through
all of this ...

63
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,004
I'm going to hide the pickax,
all the knives,

64
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,715
all the machetes.
I mean, little by little, they

65
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,760
just won't even see it coming.
>> See you in ten minutes.

66
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,721
>> I'm going to hide the spear
and all four masks.

67
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,349
Therefore, they don't have a way
to fish unless they're going

68
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,226
to go out there with their
bare hands.

69
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,687
I know I'm going down, but
they're going to feel it more

70
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,482
than I am.
Yes, they are.

71
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,822
>> You guys aren't getting any
snails, right?

72
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,699
Just, uh, mussels?
>> Yep.

73
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,326
I talked to Lill yesterday
about, uh... the possibility

74
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,079
of going after...
getting rid of D next.

75
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,916
>> Yeah.
>> And, Lill, what do you think?

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,545
>> I'm not real wild about it.
>> But she understood why.

77
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,714
D could win the next immunity
challenge.

78
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,382
Then we'd have to decide
between ourselves.

79
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,510
>> Jon and Burton said,
"We're going to get rid of

80
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,595
Darrah next because she's such
a threat."

81
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,557
And I thought, "This is not
right.

82
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,352
I don't like this."
You know, what happened to our

83
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,564
alliance of four people?
>> You okay, Lill?

84
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,942
>> Yeah.
First, Burton promised me

85
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,404
number two spot and now
he's hem-hawing and saying

86
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,532
that may not happen.
Not only that, they started

87
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,285
talking about getting rid of
Darrah before Sandra.

88
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,911
>> You have no problem with D
going out?

89
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,621
>> No, I mean, it's better D
than me.

90
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,416
And you two promised me
at least third.

91
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,585
>> So everything's cool.
>> We made a pact!

92
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,755
So I started thinking,
"If they can screw her over,

93
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:52,810
they can screw me over."
>> PROBST: 34 days and we are

94
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,313
down to five.
Congratulations.

95
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,939
>> Thanks.
>> Thank you.

96
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,941
>> PROBST: Today's reward
challenge is called Second

97
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,902
Chances.
You will get a second

98
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,446
chance at some of your favorite
challenges.

99
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,449
You'll begin by being tied up
to a post with two pieces of

100
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,786
rope, one on your hands,
one around your ankles.

101
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,455
Once you're untied, you'll take
the two pieces of rope,

102
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,917
dig under a bamboo fence.
You'll then come to a compass.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,628
Using a map and the two pieces
of rope, find the place where

104
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,255
the coordinates intersect.
Dig down, get a key.

105
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,717
That key lets you into one side
of a jail cell.

106
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,303
Once you're in, you need
to get out.

107
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,014
You do this by using sticks
and twine to build a pole.

108
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,475
Use the pole to retrieve
a second key.

109
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,852
That will unlock the other side
of the jail cell.

110
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,438
You'll then proceed
to the firing range.

111
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,982
Using a slingshot, you will
then break three plates.

112
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,693
Attached to each plate is a bag
of letter puzzle pieces.

113
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,446
Once you have all three bags,
use the letters to unscramble

114
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,992
a very famous pirate term.
First person to complete the

115
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,621
pirate term and have it on their
board wins reward.

116
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:57,500
As you know by now, Panama was
once a very rich city--

117
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,337
gold and silver--
until Morgan came over in 1671

118
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,298
and decided he wanted it.
Took the place, took the money,

119
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,509
burned it to the ground,
city was never rebuilt.

120
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,429
The ruins are all that remain.
So, the winner will travel

121
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,350
by boat to Panama City.
You will camp out overnight

122
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,354
in comfort, among the ruins of
old Panama-- Panama Viejo.

123
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:21,023
While spending the night
in the ruins, you will feast on

124
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,361
suckling pig, you'll have
roasted potatoes, great dessert.

125
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,655
Worth playing for?
>> Absolutely.

126
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,532
>> PROBST: All right, we'll
draw numbers for your spot.

127
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:34,078
Wait for my "Go."
For reward.

128
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:38,416
Survivors ready?
Go!

129
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,544
Sandra using her mouth to
untie the knot.

130
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,006
So's Burton.
Lill already working on her

131
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:50,720
feet.
And Lill's off.

132
00:07:50,803 --> 00:08:00,813
Lill with a big lead.
Burton is through the other

133
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:07,069
Lill with a big lead.
Burton is through the other

134
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,530
side.
Lill is through the other side.

135
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,283
Darrah working it.
Jon and Sandra still digging.

136
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,577
Darrah is now out through
the other side.

137
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,163
Lill found her coordinates.
Using her pieces of rope,

138
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,707
try and find where they
intersect.

139
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,418
You have two coordinates.
Use the pieces of rope to help

140
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,421
you find where they intersect.
Jon is through.

141
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,882
Sandra is now through.
Burton is digging.

142
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,135
Lill is having a hard time.
Darrah's found her spot.

143
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,804
She's starting to dig.
Burton digging down.

144
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,557
Is he in the right spot?
He's not sure.

145
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,936
Lill just going to start
digging.

146
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,729
Doesn't know where the
coordinates are, just going

147
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,481
to dig.
>> All right, all right.

148
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,566
Let's think about it. Focus.
North.

149
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,110
>> PROBST: Jon has his key
and he's through.

150
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,280
Jon unlocking the jail cell,
moving on.

151
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,824
Lill, you need to slow down
and start over.

152
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,952
>> I can't think what I'm doing.
North. West...

153
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,412
>> PROBST: Sandra's going to dig
in another spot.

154
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,122
Burton's still digging
in the same spot.

155
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:05,962
Thinks he's in the right spot,
and he is-- Burton has his key.

156
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,298
>> Northwest.
>> PROBST: Jon at work on his

157
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:17,139
pole.
Sandra has her key.

158
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:27,275
Lill has her key.
Burton moving quickly

159
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:34,156
on his pole.
>> Slow down, Lill, slow down.

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,159
Focus. Focus.
Come on, old girl. Focus.

161
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,330
>> PROBST: Darrah has her key.
She's in the game.

162
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,171
Jon's still working on his pole,
wants to make sure it's long

163
00:09:49,255 --> 00:10:00,641
enough.
Burton has his key.

164
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,769
Burton has his key in the cage,
going to unlock himself,

165
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,856
let himself out of the cell.
Burton is the first one out.

166
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:15,364
Goes to work on his slingshot.
Burton breaks his first plate.

167
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:21,329
Jon six inches short.
Lill going to give her pole

168
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:26,584
a shot.
Burton has all three plates.

169
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,712
Burton starting to work on
his letter pieces.

170
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,882
Burton has his first pieces
open, dumps them on the ground

171
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,886
for letters.
Lill very close.

172
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,140
A lot of bend, it doesn't look
strong enough.

173
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,908
>> Got it.
>> PROBST: Say it, Burton.

174
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,744
>> "Jolly Roger."
>> PROBST: Burton wins reward.

175
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:13,923
Nice job.
Burton, come on over.

176
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,759
Well, it wouldn't be much of
a memory if you had to do it

177
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,219
alone.
>> Yep.

178
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,054
It's an overnight feast.
Who do you want to bring

179
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,764
with you?
>> I'm going to take Jon.

180
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,599
>> PROBST: Jon, come on over.
>> You're getting a big hug,

181
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:33,651
baby!
>> Going into the reward,

182
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:44,286
baby!
>> Going into the reward,

183
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,123
I had talked to Jon that if I
went, I'm gonna take him and

184
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,125
vice versa.
'Cause, honestly, we've been

185
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,752
going on these rewards with
people that we don't like

186
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,963
that much.
So, I was looking forward

187
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,799
to going on a reward with
someone it'd be fun with.

188
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,469
>> Wow, that is awesome.
>> There, there.

189
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,931
There, there.
>> Oh, this is so awesome.

190
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,976
Do you see how close we are?
It was cool that Burton picked

191
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,520
me to share along the
experience.

192
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,440
And it was the first time in
the game in which Burton and I

193
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,651
felt as though we could both
step away from camp,

194
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:20,072
strategically, and not overly
worry.

195
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,004
>> PROBST: Thanks for the ride,
guys.

196
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,340
>> We finally get to Panama City
and we're walking up

197
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,886
the boat ramp and I see
in a parking lot all by itself,

198
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,389
brand spanking new,
a GMC Envoy SUV.

199
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,976
>> PROBST: Let's catch ourselves
a ride...

200
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,978
unless, of course,
you're digging that ride.

201
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,980
>> Yeah.
>> Oh, yeah.

202
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,982
>> PROBST: I happen to have the
keys.

203
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,984
They now belong to you.
>> Oh, well, congratulations!

204
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,487
>> Right on.
Let's check it out. Come on.

205
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,906
Jeff pulled out the keys,
and sure enough, the brand-new

206
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:06,535
Envoy is, uh, my new vehicle.
(laughs)

207
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,538
>> Congratulations, man!
Congratulations!

208
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,082
>> PROBST: It's a kind of
a combination SUV, truck, car.

209
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,709
>> Right.
>> PROBST: A couple of cool

210
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,170
features. Come back here.
This comes with the car.

211
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,589
It's full-on camping gear.
Set this up, it becomes

212
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,050
a camper.
>> It's an awesome prize, and

213
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,552
I love camping, snowboarding
and skiing.

214
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,930
So the four-wheel drive and
everything is... it's awesome.

215
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,890
>> PROBST: So, there's a map
inside.

216
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,226
It will lead you to the ruins.
I think you'll know 'em when

217
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,311
you see 'em.
Food awaits.

218
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,397
Have a good time, guys.
>> 30-plus days ago,

219
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,442
I would have been pissed off
if anyone had won it but me.

220
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,570
But, uh, at this point in the
game, uh, seeing what Burton's

221
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,907
done for the tribe and for
me personally, and what he has

222
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,285
done challenge-wise, he deserved
the car more than anyone else.

223
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,121
And it's kind of a cool feeling
knowing I can say that

224
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,083
and actually mean it.
Win, lose or draw, you're

225
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,671
the only person
that I like in this game.

226
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,261
Are you loving it?
>> Dude, I can't believe it.

227
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:13,769
This is amazing.
We drove through downtown

228
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,814
Panama City, and as we're
getting closer, you could see a

229
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,108
large tower that's still
standing.

230
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,402
And then, when you actually
get in there, there's quite

231
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,238
a bit of the city left
from a structural standpoint--

232
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,992
all the old stone walls
and structures.

233
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,582
So we pulled into the ruins,
and our feast was set up

234
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,419
under this tent and our jaws
just hit the ground.

235
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,755
Oh, my Lord.
>> Beans, apple sauce, rice,

236
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,132
fruit...
>> Mm-hmm.

237
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,426
>> Dude, marshmallows.
>> Wow.

238
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,304
>> I'm gonna start eating.
>> There's just food everywhere

239
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,682
and we started eating
everything, basically, at the

240
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,767
same time.
We're going to be eating for

241
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,644
about five hours.
>> Oh, my God.

242
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,480
>> There was no first course,
second course and dessert,

243
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,109
it was just anything goes.
Oh!

244
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,988
Your face, dude.
Good meal and good company.

245
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,991
>> Mm-hmm, finally.
>> To the girls eating mussels.

246
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,328
>> To the girls eating mussels.
(Burton chuckling)

247
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,997
>> Jon and I were kind of
laughing because the girls,

248
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,125
all they had were mussels
that Jon, Lill and I collected.

249
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,502
And they're not going
to catch any fish.

250
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,214
I mean, honestly, those three
girls have all been riding

251
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,217
coattails the entire time
they've been out here.

252
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:35,684
(birds screeching)
>> You don't know what those

253
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,020
boys are cooking up.
You don't know what they're

254
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,689
saying.
You don't know what they've

255
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,359
promised all of us.
>> Yeah, I know.

256
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,985
They promise everyone
something different.

257
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,862
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Until it comes down

258
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,073
to the very wire.
>> Yep.

259
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,325
>> When we got back from the
reward today, Lill said that

260
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,536
she was kind of scared,
um, about trusting the guys.

261
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,539
That's why I tell you, don't
listen to anything Jon says.

262
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,584
>> Jon screwed me once, twice,
Jon will screw me again.

263
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,045
He slapped me in the face once,
he slapped me in the face twice,

264
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,589
he won't slap me...
I have always said that they

265
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,883
were both snakes and I have
always said that they're good

266
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,052
liars.
So, everything that Lill was

267
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,888
saying is stuff that I had
already mentioned from before.

268
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,057
>> Well, let me tell you
something, little one.

269
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,059
They're ready to get rid of
you.

270
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,560
>> I know, that's why I want to
win immunity.

271
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,396
>> They're ready to get rid
of you before Sandra.

272
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,691
I wasn't going to tell you that,
but I was fighting for you.

273
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,735
And I said, "This is not right.
It should be Sandra."

274
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,363
I couldn't lie anymore.
I had to tell Darrah.

275
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,116
And it pissed me off that
these two boys were so easy

276
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,745
to break their alliance.
>> Well, I think that we

277
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:43,127
should get rid of the boys.
>> All you got to say to me,

278
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,462
"Sandra, whichever one of the
guys doesn't have immunity,

279
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,965
that's who's going home."
You don't even have to whisper

280
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,925
and take me in the bushes
and talk to me for two hours.

281
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:53,262
>> We... wait a minute.
The whole funny thing here is,

282
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,224
no matter what, I may, uh,
still only come in third.

283
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,059
>> But we all have a fair
chance.

284
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,936
>> But at least your chances
are better.

285
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,563
>> Neither one of you...
you've already told me

286
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,273
you don't want to go up in
front of a jury with me.

287
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,150
>> But if you were standing
there, Lill, you'd get

288
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,485
my million-dollar vote.
>> Only if you're on the jury.

289
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,988
>> Lill doesn't seem
to understand.

290
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,283
She keeps thinking that,
regardless, she's done at three.

291
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,618
And I tell her, I'm not
stronger than you, Lill.

292
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,620
Have I ever showed you that I
was stronger than you in all

293
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,248
these competitions?
You're not bad for 50 years old.

294
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,751
So, if you're with them,
you're going to get third.

295
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,587
But being against us, you have
a chance to move up on your own.

296
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,131
>> The only way you're going
to have a chance at one and two

297
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,509
is with us three.
Jon's going to take Burton.

298
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,929
Burton's going to take Jon.
>> Let's see who does

299
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,807
immunity tomorrow, guys.
'Cause I think we need to get...

300
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,060
think about Burton first.
>> Because he's the strongest?

301
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:47,691
>> So, if Burton wins immunity,
Jon's gone, right?

302
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,860
>> Right.
>> If one of us three win

303
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,696
immunity, Burton's gone.
>> I am totally psyched.

304
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,158
I am very happy knowing that
there's still a chance.

305
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,788
The only problem now is that I
had so many plans of sabotage

306
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,957
that now I have to hold off,
because I think it's in my

307
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,710
best interest not to
start commotion.

308
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,463
I'd be happy with third.
>> Heck, yeah.

309
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,173
I would be, too.
>> All right, let's...

310
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,133
let's do this.
Let's see who gets

311
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,843
immunity tomorrow.
>> They're going home.

312
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,930
It's going to be us three girls
in the end.

313
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,144
>> Are we worried about
the girls strategizing

314
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,063
against us?
>> No, 'cause I think that...

315
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,898
>> I feel like we're pretty
confident in our abilities...

316
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,858
>> Yeah, I think we can squash
their plans pretty quickly.

317
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,527
>> Yeah. I...
>> I mean, not one of them has

318
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,654
had a strategy yet in this game.
>> Yeah.

319
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,197
>> I don't know why it'd
start now.

320
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,740
>> Yeah, exactly.
Burton and I basically

321
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,700
just went over the fact
that the three girls

322
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,536
were probably discussing
a girls-versus-guys plan

323
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,704
while we're gone.
But it only takes one person

324
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,040
to swing the vote.
So, figure we had

325
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,584
a one-out-of-three chance
of pulling one of them back.

326
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,837
And we feel that we definitely
have an intellectual advantage

327
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,839
over the others.
>> Good to go.

328
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,758
Hey, hey.
Dude, this thing's pretty sweet.

329
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,053
Jon and I were just kind of
shooting the breeze,

330
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,556
talking about not talking about
the car when we got back to

331
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,184
camp, because it is something
that someone might hold against

332
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,728
me.
I think we should be able to get

333
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,356
back and smooth everything over.
We literally need to be like,

334
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,525
"Lill, "we've gotten you this
far."

335
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,736
Like, "Don't mess it up."
We were talking about

336
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,739
who we trusted, who we didn't.
We had told Lill that we were

337
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,742
going to vote Darrah out next
and she wasn't comfortable

338
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,870
with it.
So I don't know if I can trust

339
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,913
anything she says to me
here on out.

340
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,125
I think we approach Sandra
just as a backup.

341
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,794
>> Yeah.
>> Be like, "Hey, Sandra..."

342
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,547
>> "Final Three."
>> "Final Three..."

343
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,216
>> She doesn't trust us at all,
but you know what,

344
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,760
I bet she would again.
How many times have I dogged

345
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,763
that girl out?
>> To be honest, Jon and I

346
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,142
have been running the show
for the last 20 days nearly.

347
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,103
And those three girls,
I don't think they could come

348
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,938
up with a decent strategy
if they had to.

349
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,817
>> We have played everything
about as perfectly as it

350
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,779
can be played in this game.
>> A lot of people are about

351
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,616
to get run over by the bus,
but you and I are good.

352
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,952
>> Exactly.
(Jon laughing)

353
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:33,440
>> I don't know why God's
putting me through this.

354
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,484
I just can't sleep, guys,
and it hurts.

355
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,611
>> You can take it for four
days.

356
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,322
You will have to take it for
four days.

357
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,658
>> You going to have to.
>> You going to have to take it

358
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,868
for four days.
>> It's going to drag you along.

359
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,997
>> I can't sleep because,
you know, my arms and my legs

360
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,750
are on fire.
I'm just...

361
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,628
I just feel numb this morning.
I'm just...

362
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,173
I don't know if it's menopause.
I don't know what it is,

363
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:01,176
but it's hurting me.
>> I think, yeah...

364
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,179
I think you're stressing now.
>> If I could just get some

365
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:07,182
rest.
>> You have to think positive.

366
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:10,185
>> Yeah, but, see, if I could
just rest in my mind.

367
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,647
My mind is just not rested.
>> Are you thinking about

368
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,399
Burton?
Is that why you're so stressed?

369
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,693
Is that one of the primary
reasons?

370
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,737
I'm worried that he's going
to get immunity and Jon goes,

371
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:27,703
and then he's going to attack.
(sighs)

372
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,460
>> You think Lill's getting
nervous?

373
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:40,007
>> She stresses out about
every little thing.

374
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,218
>> I would hate for today to be
one of those relaxed days,

375
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,554
'cause we need to get Burton out
of here as soon as possible.

376
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,889
>> Mm-hmm.
>> 'Cause one whole day is

377
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,561
enough time to turn anybody's
head around.

378
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,105
That's not good.
>> Uh-uh.

379
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,190
>> When Burton and Jon come
back, I'm going to do what I

380
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:01,111
usually do whenever they betray
me-- be the outcast until Jon

381
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,780
comes to me and says, "Don't
worry, Sandra.

382
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,324
I swear, you won't be the next
to go, as long as you vote

383
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,410
this person out."
"Okay, Jon.

384
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,246
If that'll save my skin again,
then I shall do that."

385
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,582
We already made our pact.
I'll say "yes" to whatever he

386
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,959
says, and I'll come back
and let you know.

387
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,962
I won't betray.
The sooner we get rid of these

388
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,965
jackasses, the better.
I can't worry about what

389
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,051
Lill's going to do.
If every minute I'm looking over

390
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,927
my shoulder like, "What in the
hell is Lill doing?"

391
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,637
They're going to know
something's up.

392
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,806
That's usually Burton's job,
to keep control of everybody

393
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,933
and figure out where everyone's
at-- who's with who, who's not

394
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,478
with who, who's peeing,
who's cooking...

395
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,272
No, I'm going to lay there
and, hopefully, try to take a

396
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,983
nap and just relax.
When I see them sitting up on

397
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,611
the beach, I'm just going
to lay down...

398
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,740
and put on my game face.
>> Sounds good.

399
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:13,850
>> Hell or high water.
I'm not changing my mind.

400
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:27,155
I hope you guys have hangovers.
>> Yeah, that's the one

401
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,324
thing you do have.
>> All regrets...

402
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,660
and hangovers a little bit.
>> I'll tell you what...

403
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,663
When Jon and I got off the
boat, Lill and Darrah met us.

404
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,457
Like, "Hey, how's it going?"
We told them what we were...

405
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,626
how our thing was.
And we're like, "So, how'd

406
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,461
everything go here?"
And they immediately started

407
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,380
bashing Sandra.
She's ready to go,

408
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,715
she wants to be gone,
and that's how she's acting.

409
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,509
It's like...
>> She went by herself and

410
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,386
we were off by ourselves.
>> She hasn't tried to

411
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,971
strategize?
>> No.

412
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,514
>> No.
>> We were taking a bath.

413
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,349
She wouldn't even come by us.
>> Well, she had to have said,

414
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,143
"Let's vote Burton out
or Jon out."

415
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,894
>> No, she didn't.
She just said, "I'm done."

416
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,646
>> She really has not talked
to us at all.

417
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,856
>> She's so mad.
>> Wow.

418
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,858
>> Like, we ask her something,
she answers us and that's it.

419
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:07,154
It's like she just cuts us
short.

420
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:15,078
>> Sandra D., how are you doing?
What's wrong?

421
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:23,837
>> Nothing.
>> You all right?

422
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,047
>> I'm good.
>> All right.

423
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,718
All good in the hood?
>> All good in the hood.

424
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,554
The girls seem to be putting up
quite an act.

425
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,724
Lill and Darrah came up,
"Sandra's not talking to us.

426
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,434
Sandra hasn't done anything."
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

427
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:41,438
Sandra's in bed pouting
and puffing.

428
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,857
>> Why should I do anything if
I'm thinking I'm going home?

429
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,817
Why should I lift a finger?
>> So, you want to go home?

430
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,861
>> Why...? No.
Why should I go get water if I'm

431
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,613
going to get bit by the
mosquitoes?

432
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,531
>> Guys, I got to put my feet
in the water.

433
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,076
I'll be back.
>> Hey, D?

434
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,746
>> Yeah.
>> Come on, walk with me.

435
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,415
>> Still not exactly buying what
the girls are selling.

436
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,084
I don't know if I can trust
them, but I know, given

437
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,629
enough time, we're going to
catch them in some lies.

438
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,423
'Cause, one, none of them are
good liars and, two, none of

439
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,927
them have any good strategies.
So, we need to put some

440
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,096
pressure on them and figure out
what's going on.

441
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,098
Well, what are you...
what are you thinking

442
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,144
at this point in the game?
>> I don't know.

443
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,314
>> I can't believe you three
didn't try to figure out

444
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,275
a girl alliance to go against
Jon and me.

445
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,489
>> Sandra is ready to leave.
>> Yeah, but Sandra's also

446
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,616
money-hungry.
>> Honey, what do you

447
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,284
want me to say?
>> No, I'm just, I'm just...

448
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,620
>> I'm tired, I'm worn out, I'm
beat, I feel like I been kicked.

449
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,122
>> Okay, okay.
>> What's up, Sandra?

450
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:45,418
>> I ain't doing nothing.
I'm ready to pack my ... and go.

451
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,129
>> But I just want to go home...
>> Yeah.

452
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,215
>> ...to my husband and
my children, my dirty house and,

453
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,343
you know, my overgrown flower
garden and...

454
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,471
>> I hear you.
>> You work out more trustable

455
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,307
than those two, at this point
in time, for me and Burton.

456
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,977
Are you aware of that?
'Cause they won't turn

457
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,813
on each other.
>> Talk to me in English, Jon.

458
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,482
>> Talk to you in English?
Okay.

459
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,694
Well, do you want Final Three?
>> I'll take Final Three.

460
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,029
Swear it on your grandma.
>> I swear it on my grandma.

461
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,990
Hey, I can guarantee
you Final Three,

462
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,450
and me and Burton, you know
will not backstab each other.

463
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,120
And we need one person that we
can trust and then we can...

464
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,497
that's Final Three.
>> Look me in the eyes and say,

465
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,541
"I swear on my..."
>> I swear on my grandmother.

466
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,168
I swear, I swear, I swear.
Look, do you guys have a plan

467
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,671
or not?
>> Lill, would you vote D out

468
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,507
the next deal if she didn't have
immunity?

469
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,926
>> If you want to go for D,
and you feel that that's

470
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,012
the strategy behind it,
then we'll go for D.

471
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,056
>> All right, we want D gone
first.

472
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,019
If D wins immunity, it's Lill.
Do we... I mean, I need you to

473
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,730
swear... there's only one swear
that I'll accept from you

474
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,690
to believe you.
>> Okay, what you want

475
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,525
me to swear on?
>> Your two kids.

476
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,527
>> He was like,
"Swear on your kids."

477
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,904
>> Let me see those fingers.
>> And then he said,

478
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,906
"Let me see your hands."
'Cause he didn't want me,

479
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,826
I guess, to have my fingers
crossed. How dumb is that?

480
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,412
I swear on my two kids
that I'm with you guys until,

481
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,165
what, the Final Three.
So I said, "I swear on my kids."

482
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,917
And in my head, in mumbling
under my breath, I was like,

483
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:12,464
"I swear on my kids that I'm
going to screw you and Burton."

484
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:25,185
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.
Darrah, I need this back.

485
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:30,440
Back-to-back, it's been
on your back.

486
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:34,694
Immunity back up for grabs.
Big stakes, down to five.

487
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,239
Here's how it's going to work.
For today's immunity challenge,

488
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,117
you're going to walk the plank.
There are a series

489
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,370
of five planks.
They're each locked

490
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,706
in the up position.
The key to unlock each plank

491
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,292
is attached to a float
that's at the bottom

492
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,337
of a plastic tube.
Using your canteen, you're going

493
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,256
to get water from the ocean,
dump it in that tube,

494
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,927
raise the float to the top,
get the key, unlock the plank.

495
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,055
Get one plank down, it leads you
to the next.

496
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,266
First person to unlock
all five of their planks,

497
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,978
retrieve their flag and get back
to the start wins immunity.

498
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,065
For the winner, guaranteed spot
in the Final Four.

499
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,484
Everybody else vulnerable
at the next Tribal Council.

500
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,653
And for one person,
game will be over.

501
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:20,323
Head on out.
Take your spots.

502
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,909
Here we go, guys.
For immunity.

503
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,496
Survivors ready?
Go!

504
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:34,421
Everybody filling canteens.
Darrah's first up.

505
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:38,091
Jon and Burton right behind.
There's Lill.

506
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:42,971
Sandra.
Everybody in it.

507
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:47,016
Darrah reaching way down in
there with those small hands.

508
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,520
Darrah's got her first key.
Jon, you're going

509
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,189
to need more water.
Sandra, you too.

510
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,108
Remember guys, when
you need water,

511
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,444
got to come back
to the starting plank.

512
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,155
Darrah with a big head start
has her first lock undone,

513
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,825
letting down her first plank.
Lill right behind.

514
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,870
Jon hangs on.
He's doing all right.

515
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,831
Burton has his first key.
Darrah filling back up.

516
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,126
Sandra's got her first key.
Burton lets his first plank

517
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,671
down.

second tube up.

519
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,844
Jon still working on
his first lock.

520
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,513
He's got it off,
lets his plank down.

521
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:31,186
Darrah has her second lock
undone.

522
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,397
Sandra and Lill going
for their second key.

523
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:41,154

524
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,199

loses her canteen.

525
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,995
Back to the start, Darrah.

526
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:56,669
Jon drops his second plank.
Darrah shoves her hand down with

527
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,465
even less water this time,
pulls it out, has her third key.

528
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:04,344
All that weight loss
coming in handy.

529
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,721
Lill making her way out
to her third lock.

530
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:08,932
Burton staying tight
with Darrah.

531
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,352
Darrah has her third plank down.
Sandra's got her second.

532
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,562
Sandra racing back
for more water.

533
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:19,234
Burton racing back
for more water.

534
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,111
( grunts )
Lill shoving her hand down

535
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:26,407
in the tube
and it may be stuck.

536
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,039
Lill's got her key out.
Struggling with the lock,

537
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,292
trying to get it undone.
Jon going to shove

538
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,379
his hand down in there.
Jonny Fairplay has

539
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,715
his third key.
Lill lets her plank down.

540
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,931
And it's stuck.
Jon drops his plank.

541
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,183
He's pulled up even with Darrah.
Both going for

542
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,769
their fourth lock.
Burton fighting

543
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:57,063
on his third lock.
Lill just fighting with her

544
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,524
plank.
You got to control it, Lill.

545
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,110
>> Damn!
>> PROBST: Burton drops his

546
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:07,448
third plank, Darrah her fourth.
One more for Darrah.

547
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,493
Jon has his fourth plank,
back even with Darrah.

548
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,246
Burton heading back
for more water.

549
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:19,794
Lill finally back in it.
Jon can't reach his fifth key,

550
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:23,631
got to come back for water.
It's a two-way race right now:

551
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:28,303
Darrah and Jon.
Sandra's got her third plank

552
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,807
down.
Darrah heading back out.

553
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,483
Darrah working on her last
plank.

554
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,486
Will she have enough water to
get her hand back down in

555
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,116
and get the key?
Jon working on his fifth key.

556
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,660
Darrah's going for it.
She has her last float.

557
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,914
She's got the fifth key.
She's letting her

558
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:01,210
final plank down.
Jon's got his fifth key.

559
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:05,757
Darrah making her way across
to get the flag.

560
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,513
Darrah has her flag,
heading back.

561
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:18,728
Jon gets his fifth lock open.
All Darrah has to do is get back

562
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:24,651
without falling in.
Jon drops his fifth plank,

563
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,488
but it doesn't matter.
For the third time in a row,

564
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,659
Darrah wins immunity.
Congratulations.

565
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,869
Here's the deal.
Third time in a row

566
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,663
you have immunity.
You are safe at the next

567
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,375
Tribal Council.
Sandra, Lill, Jon and Burton,

568
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,877
one of the four of you
is going home.

569
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,589
Immunity right up there.
Swim over, grab it.

570
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,176
You guys can head back into
camp.

571
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,458
>> Uh, D won for the third time
in a row.

572
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,544
Uh, Lill is now next to go
as a result.

573
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,255
And, you know, I feel
kind of bad about that,

574
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,757
but Lill has, uh,
physically and emotionally

575
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,927
just broken down at this point.
Lill has not talked with us

576
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,431
like she usually does.
Uh, Lill has, uh, not done

577
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,392
the work that she...
that she usually does.

578
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,310
And, uh, that's
a different Lill.

579
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,229
And her actions are telling me
that I can't trust her

580
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,065
right now.
What's the word, T-bird?

581
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:49,026
>> I just gave Burton
my full report.

582
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,114
Go ask Burton.
I'm not feeling well.

583
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,950
I'm not sleeping.
I hurt like hell.

584
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:59,120
So please, you two,
stop playing tag team

585
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,456
on me, please.
>> We're not playing tag team.

586
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,624
I was just asking
how you're doing.

587
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:13,676
>> Oh. I'm okay.
>> No, no, no.

588
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,015
>> Oh. I'm okay.
>> No, no, no.

589
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:24,854
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Lill is, Lill is a basket

590
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,980
case right now.
>> I know.

591
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,816
>> Her body is shutting off.
She sleeps an hour a night.

592
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,652
She's freaking out.
She's a disaster.

593
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,988
If, if no other reason,
that's why we got

594
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:35,698
to get rid of her.
Lill's acting weird.

595
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,326
She's on her last legs.
She's just not doing well.

596
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,620
And she's developing a pretty
tight relationship with Darrah

597
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,831
that's making me nervous.
Um, but the way Jon and I

598
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,126
are seeing it,
if we can get Sandra to vote

599
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,670
with us to get Lill off,
um, I think

600
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,048
it'll be a pretty good move.
>> This is not good for

601
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,341
business.
>> What?

602
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,551
>> This chick winning
everything.

603
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,512
>> No.
So, here's the deal.

604
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,056
Lill told me that you three
had talked about,

605
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,475
like, a girls' alliance.
>> She must be making that up,

606
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,310
'cause I'm not going
with Lill anyway.

607
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,187
I know how much...
how she feels about me.

608
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,190
She... they whisper about me.
I know they do,

609
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,567
regardless of this grandma
niceness that she portrays.

610
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,569
>> What about Darrah?
Same thing?

611
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,571
>> Darrah don't even talk to me.
You know what I'm saying?

612
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,532
>> Well, you two should...
>> We don't, we haven't even

613
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,367
been talking about chocolate
chips which is something

614
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,160
that we always talk about.
>> Yeah.

615
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,871
>> So I wouldn't worry
if I were you,

616
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,374
'cause I'm a write Lill's name
down big as ...

617
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,710
If that's what's going
to save me, then so be it.

618
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,712
>> Uh, I've really never
spoken strategy with Sandra.

619
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,507
The good thing about her,
though, is she'd vote out her

620
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,093
best friend, her worst enemy.
She would go to the next level

621
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,388
with five people she hated
to get to that next level.

622
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,890
So, it's very cut and dry
with Sandra.

623
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,434
There's no, "Oh, I have
feelings for this person"

624
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,061
or "I don't know
if we should do that."

625
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,938
She doesn't care.
She goes, "If I'm staying in

626
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:53,192
the game, I'll vote for them."
>> That's a good fire, right

627
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:57,572
there.
>> Mm-hmm.

628
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,282
>> No, no, no.
>> Leave her something.

629
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,076
>> We're definitely going to
leave her food, but we're all

630
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,080
100% in agreement for, um, Lill?
>> Yeah.

631
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:08,249
>> And, and it's the smartest
thing for all of us to do

632
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,959
because...
>> Absolutely. We all agree.

633
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,919
>> With her in the game,
if someone ends up against her,

634
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,713
they're not going to win.
>> Right.

635
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,590
>> All right.
>> All three girls are as dumb.

636
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,050
There's no...
they share a brain...

637
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,094
I don't even think they share a
whole brain, or obviously they

638
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,555
would figure out, "Hey, we can
get rid of these guys."

639
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,557
They're foolish.
I mean, uh, the girls

640
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,310
in this game have...
have done nothing to, uh,

641
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,896
nothing for women's rights
or anything like that.

642
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,315
I mean, like, uh,
they'd be better off, you know,

643
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,401
scrubbing potatoes and mopping
floors, uh, to... to get bills

644
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,778
passed at this point.
Uh, they, they've shown

645
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,281
they're nothing more than
followers in this game.

646
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,617
I think it's downright foolish
that they didn't talk.

647
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,745
But, uh, I felt, and will
continue to feel that I'm much

648
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,456
smarter than them anyways.
So, I guess, uh,

649
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:58,507
kind of par for the course.
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

650
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:05,097
kind of par for the course.
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

651
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:10,436
the members of our jury:
Ryno, Rupert, T, and Christa,

652
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:15,775
voted out at the last Tribal
Council.

653
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:19,987
36 days you've been out here.
Darrah, how are you

654
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,031
holding up?
>> Um, I'm holding up pretty

655
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,367
good, besides losing all the
weight.

656
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,827
>> PROBST: Although, that worked
to your advantage yesterday.

657
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,830
>> Yeah. Yeah, majorly,
for having small hands.

658
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,334
But, um, I don't have as much
energy to do, really, anything.

659
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,504
This morning, getting firewood
just, like, killed me, but,

660
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,214
um...
>> We don't even talk.

661
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,841
>> PROBST: What's that?
>> We don't even talk.

662
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,010
>> PROBST: It's too much energy.
>> Yeah.

663
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,137
You don't even want
to open your mouth.

664
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,723
>> PROBST: Jon, you've got to be
a little impressed that, of

665
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,851
the five people left,
three are women.

666
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,354
>> Lill is the strongest
person here, easily.

667
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,982
I mean, she works harder
than everyone else.

668
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,693
Sandra is as tough as
every single one of us.

669
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,195
And D, three immunities
in a row.

670
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:03,197
There's not a guy here that can
say that.

671
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,408
So, I'm very impressed with
these women, in that aspect.

672
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,035
>> PROBST: Lill, did you
honestly expect you would be

673
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,706
here 36 days in?
>> Truthfully, between

674
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:16,252
you, me and God, no.
I never thought I would make it

675
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,213
this far.
I've done some tough things in

676
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,717
my life, but nothing like this.
I just need the strength

677
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,512
to go on for another three days
or however long my tribe

678
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,223
will keep me here.
>> PROBST: Jon...

679
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:31,392
how you feeling tonight?
>> Tribal Councils scare

680
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,061
the crap out of me, man.
I don't like them.

681
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,355
I don't like them at all.
This has turned into

682
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,691
surprise Tribal Council
every time.

683
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,736
So, uh, I don't want to be on
the other end of a surprise.

684
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,864
>> PROBST: Burton,
do you feel badly at all when

685
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:48,409
you send somebody out of here
who had no idea it was coming?

686
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,787
>> I feel awful when people
get blindsided.

687
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,915
I was somewhat blindsided
when I got voted out.

688
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,544
And it's something that I don't
wish to do on anybody.

689
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,464
But, I mean, a lot of times you
do it and it's the only way

690
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,258
you can guarantee that somehow
it doesn't get reversed around

691
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:07,470
and you get blindsided.
So, it, it's

692
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,930
a double-edged sword.
>> PROBST: Darrah, for the third

693
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,266
time, you have immunity.
I'm not sensing you want

694
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,976
to give it up.
>> No.

695
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,770
>> PROBST: All right.
Darrah is the only

696
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,481
one you cannot vote for.
It is time to find out which way

697
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,442
that sword will cut tonight.
It's time to vote.

698
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:34,413
Burton, you're up.
>> Lill, you're not someone I'd

699
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,041
want to go up against in the
Final Two, so your time has

700
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:47,093
come.
>> I'm hardcore. I'm hardcore.

701
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:52,515
come.
>> I'm hardcore. I'm hardcore.

702
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:56,685
I'm hardcore. And you're nice.
Have a nice day.

703
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:14,120
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

704
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,464
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

705
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,466
The person voted out
will be asked to leave

706
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,385
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

707
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:35,057
I'll read the votes.
First vote:

708
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:42,148
"Lill."
"Lill."

709
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:49,530
Two votes Lill.
"Burton."

710
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:54,076
That's two votes, Lill,
one vote, Burton.

711
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,956
"Burton."
That's two votes, Lill,

712
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,836
two votes, Burton.
12th person voted out

713
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:09,884
of the tribe...
"Burton."

714
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:18,392
Bring me your torch.
Burton, for the second time

715
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:26,358
the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

716
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:39,914
Well, another surprise vote.
I got to hand it to you guys.

717
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,708
You have become masters
of the blindside,

718
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,212
which should make these last
three days very interesting

719
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:50,216
because clearly,
based on tonight's 3-2 vote,

720
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,968
three of you are together.
The only problem:

721
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,055
ain't nobody playing for third.
You guys can head back to camp.

722
00:41:56,138 --> 00:42:06,106
Good night.
Stay tuned for scenes

723
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:11,904
Good night.
Stay tuned for scenes

724
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:17,409
from our next episode.
>> PROBST: Next time on

725
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,745
<i>Survivor:</i>
One of these four castaways

726
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,623
will make it to the end.
>> You really can't trust Jonny.

727
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,166
You don't know
if he's lying or not.

728
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,834
>> I'm the king of men,
and they're women.

729
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,337
>> I will be in damn shock
if I'm not voted out tonight.

730
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,631
>> I would love to be able to
say "I did it."

731
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,635
>> PROBST: Join us for the final
episode and find out who will be

732
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,637
the sole Survivor.

734
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,686
>> It's been an amazing
experience to have been voted

735
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,147
out and given the opportunity
to come back in.

736
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,942
Of the four left,
I wish Jon the best

737
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,778
and I hope he wins.
Lill, I hope you can

738
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,155
live with yourself.
We had an alliance,

739
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,659
you broke it,
um, big as Texas, so I hope

740
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,828
you can live with that.
