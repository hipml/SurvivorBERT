1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,610
Jeff: THE GREATEST SOCIAL
EXPERIMENT ON TELEVISION IS

2
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:11,878
BACK.

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,348
WITH A MODERN TAKE ON ONE OF THE
MOST INTRYINGING MATCHUPS OF ALL

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,516
TIME.

5
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,819
THIS IS "SURVIVOR: DAVID VS.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:26,326
GOLIATH."

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,997
THE DAVID TRIBE, TEN STRANGERS
WHO SHARE ONE THING IN COMMON --

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,332
OVERCOMING OBSTACLES.

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,102
THEY HAVE SPENT THEIR LIVES
BATTLING ADVERSITY AND ARE

10
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,504
ALWAYS THE UNDERDOG.

11
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,141
IVE BEEN INTERESTED IN
ROBOTS SINCE I WAS A WEE BABY

12
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,375
CHILD.

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,745
AND EVERYONE HERE IS GOING TO
ASSUME IM A HUGE NERD, WHICH IS

14
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,013
NOT ENTIRELY INCORRECT.

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,083
IM NOT EXACTLY THE KIND OF GUY
WHO CRUISED BY ON HIS GOOD LOOKS

16
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:54,387
THROUGHOUT LIFE, BUT NOW IM A
ROBOTICS RESEARCH SCIENTIST, AND

17
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,891
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED ABOUT
WHAT I CAN PULL OUT.

18
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,727
THERES EIGHT KIDS IN MY
FAMILY.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,729
MY MOM HOME SCHOOLED ALL OF US.

20
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:06,866
WE DIDNT HAVE A WHOLE LOT, BUT
WE EARNED IT WITH BLOOD, SWEAT

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,034
AND TEARS.

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,235
I COULD THROW A BALE OF HAY
HIGHER THAN ANYBODY WHEN I WAS

23
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,571
12.

24
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:15,975
Jeff: THEYLL TAKE ON THE
GOLIATH TRIBE, TEN STRANGERS WHO

25
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,812
ALSO SHARE ONE THING IN
COMMON -- WINNING.

26
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,715
THEY HAVE SPENT THEIR LIVES
CAPITALIZING ON THEIR ASSETSS AN

27
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,285
ARE ALWAYS CONSIDERED THE
FAVORITES.

28
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,153
IVE BEEN AMAZING IN
BUSINESS.

29
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,490
EVERYTHING I TOUCH TURNS TO
GOLD.

30
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:34,227
I AM A PUBLISHER AND C.E.O. OF
THE LARGEST BLACK NEWSPAPER ON

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,161
THE WEST COAST.

32
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,863
IM A PROVEN LEADER.

33
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:41,601
IVE HAD PEOPLE WHO WOULD TAKE A
BULLET FOR ME.

34
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,504
IVE HAD A FAIRYTALE LIFE.

35
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,139
I STUDIED AT STANFORD YOUTH.

36
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,641
I GOT MY MBA FROM YALE.

37
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,978
THERES SO MUCH ABOUT WHO I AM
THAT PUTS ME AT SUCH AN

38
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,480
ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION.

39
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:57,250
AND I AM GOING TO BE A FORCE TO
BE RECKONED WITH OUT HERE.

40
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,987
Jeff: WHICH TRAITS WILL
MOVE MOST USEFUL IN THIS CUNNING

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,489
GAME OF SOCIAL POLITICS?

42
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:07,460
IM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT YOU
DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER,

43
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,797
BECAUSE LITTLE TINY SNAKES,Y,
LOOK AT THAT LITTLE SNAKE.

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,765
LITTLE DO YOU KNOW, HES
PROBABLY GOT THE BADDEST BITE IN

45
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:17,437
THE JUNGLE.

46
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,206
Jeff: FOR THE NEXT 39 DAYS,
THEY WILL BE ABANDONED IN THE

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,674
ISLANDS OF FIJI.

48
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,411
THEY MUST LEARN TO ADAPT OR
THEYLL BE VOTED OUT.

49
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:31,417
IN THE END, ONLY ONE WILL REMAIN
TO CLAIM THE $1 MILLION PRIZE.

50
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:43,730
39 DAYS, 20 PEOPLE, ONE SURVIVOR
 AS IMEN -- AS IM ON THIS

51
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:18,898
BOAT TO START "SURVIVOR," I LOOK
AT EVERYONE ON THE BOAT AROUND

52
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,532
ME.

53
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,768
I WONDER, IS THIS MY TRIBE?

54
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:25,872
WE JUST LOOK STACKED, SO MUCH
STRENGTH, SO MUCH BEAUTY, SOME

55
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:30,009
CLEAR BRAINS.

56
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:37,050
AND AS I LOOK AT THE OTHER
TRIBE, I HAVE THE BIGGEST SMILE

57
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,785
ON MY FACE.

58
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,055
THE CARDS ARE JUST STACKED COME
WILL THELY IN OUR FAVOR, AND I

59
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,758
WANT TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF
THAT.

60
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,160
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

61
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:52,332
WELCOME TO THE 37th SEASON
OF "SURVIVOR."

62
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:58,071
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
"SURVIVOR" IS A GAME OF SOCIAL

63
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:02,041
POLITICS THAT OFTEN REVOLVES
AROUND THE STORY OF THE UNDERDOG

64
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,610
VERSUS THE FAVORITE.

65
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,812
IT COMES IN A LOT OF FORMS.

66
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,215
IT MIGHT BE THE PHYSICALLY WEAK
VERSUS THE PHYSICALLY STRONG.

67
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,685
SOMETIMES ITS THE SOCIALLY
AWKWARD VERSUS THE NATURALLY

68
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,853
CHARMING.

69
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,823
WHATEVER FORM IT TAKES, ITS AN
ENDURING MATCHUP THAT HAS

70
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,325
PROVIDED SOME OF OUR GREATEST
SHOWDOWNS.

71
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,863
BUT WHAT COMPLICATES "SURVIVOR"
IS THE UNKNOWN.

72
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,065
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT.

73
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,168
YOU DONT KNOW WHICH SKILL SET
WILL COME IN HANDY.

74
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:33,206
AND YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT
THE OTHER PLAYERS.

75
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,843
SO THE QUESTION EVERY DAY IS THE
SAME.

76
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,078
ITS NOT WHO HAS THE ADVANTAGE.

77
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,481
ITS WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE.

78
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,017
THATS THE THEME WERE GOING TO
EXPLORE THIS SEASON.

79
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,052
THIS IS "SURVIVOR: DAVID VS.

80
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:46,753
GOLIATH."

81
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,721
LETS GO, BABY!

82
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:53,092
COME ON!

83
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:58,197
[APPLAUSE]
 Matt: DAVID TRIBE, TAKE

84
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:58,698
YOUR BUFFS.

85
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,400
LETS GO, BABY.

86
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,434
YEAH.

87
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,169
Jeff: PASS EM OUT AND PUT
EM ON.

88
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,738
LETS GO.

89
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,707
ORANGE, BABY.

90
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,876
Jeff: GUY IN THE BACK IN
THE MIDDLE, WHATS YOUR NAME?

91
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,810
NICK.

92
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,513
Jeff: NICK, TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR UPBRINGING.

93
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,348
WERE YOU A DAVID FROM THE TIME
YOU WERE LITTLE?

94
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,749
ABSOLUTELY.

95
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,052
I GREW UP IN A TRAILER.

96
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,722
IF I WANTED TO MAKE SOMETHING
OUT OF MYSELF, I HAD TO GO AND

97
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:23,956
GET IT FOR MYSELF.

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,027
I MEAN, I WAS FIRST PERSON IN MY
FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE, SO I

99
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,295
LEARNED IT BY DOING IT.

100
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,365
I GREW UP POOR IN SOUTHEASTERN
KENTUCKY.

101
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,334
WE HAD FOOD STAMPS.

102
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,538
SO I ALWAYS TOOK TO SCHOOLING AS
MY WAY TO GET OUT, AND NOW IM

103
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,973
THE PUBLIC DEFENDER IN MY
COUNTY.

104
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,310
I HAD TWO DREAMS TO BE A LAWYER
AND TO BE ON "SURVIVOR."

105
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,612
HERE I AM WITH BOTH OF THOSE.

106
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:51,417
Jeff: WOMAN IN THE FRONT ON
THE CORNER, WHATS YOUR NAME?

107
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,585
GABBY.

108
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,222
Jeff: DOES THIS RING TRUE
TO YOU, THE STORY OF A DAVID,

109
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,324
MAYBE SOMEONE WHO HAS THE CLIMB
THE MOUNTAIN EVERY TIME IN.

110
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,960
BEING A DAVID, WE HAVE A LOT
MORE TO PROVE.

111
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,863
WERE NOT AT THE TOP WHERE WE
CAN LET PEOPLE DOWN.

112
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,332
WERE STARTING AT THE BOTTOM AND
WE HAVE TO CLIMB OUR WAY UP.

113
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,067
I THINK THATS A COOLER STORY.

114
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:12,839
YOU KNOW, DAVID NOT ONLY SLEW
GOLAITH IN THE BIBLE, HE ENDED

115
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,275
UP BECOMING A KING, TOO.

116
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:20,446
THE STORY DONT STOP WITH DAVID
VERSUS GOLIATH.

117
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,248
Jeff: I FEEL A MATCHUP
HERE.

118
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,449
ALL RIGHT.

119
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,417
GOLIATH, YOUR BUFFS.

120
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,253
GOOD CATCH.

121
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,088
BUFF ME.

122
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,424
Jeff: GUY IN THE BACK, DOES
THIS RING TRUE?

123
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:35,962
HAVE YOU ALWAYS FIFTH FELT LIKE,
I AM A GOLIATH?

124
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:40,333
WELL, OBVIOUSLY.

125
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,136
I WAS ON MY HIGH SCHOOL
WRESTLING TEAM BECAUSE I WANTED

126
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,938
TO GET INTO PRO WRESTLING.

127
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,574
ULTIMATELY ITS WHAT HAPPENED
FOR ME.

128
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:52,445
IVE BEEN A PRO WRESTLER FOR 15
YEARS.

129
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,983
PEOPLE CALL ME "THE MAYOR OF
SLAM TOWN."

130
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,718
AND "FRIDAY NIGHT DELIGHT."

131
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:04,123
I WENT TO U.C. DAVIS AND
GRADUATED WITH A DEGREE IN

132
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,224
GEOLOGY.

133
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,260
THE REASON IM HERE ISNT
NECESSARILY TO FIGURE OUT IF

134
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,828
JOHN IS THIS GOLIATH.

135
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,230
ITS REALLY TO FIGURE OUT WHO
JOHN IS.

136
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,099
Jeff: WOMAN IN THE MIDDLE,
WHATS YOUR NAME?

137
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,434
IM ALISON.

138
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,436
Jeff: DO YOU BELONG ON THE
GOLIATH TRIBE?

139
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,371
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

140
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:22,508
I COME FROM FAMILY WITH A HUGE
LEGION OF SUPPORT.

141
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,179
I MAY NOT HAVE FACED THE SAME
ADVERSITY AS SOME OF THE PEOPLE

142
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,650
ON THE DAVID MAT, BUT I STILL
UNDERSTAND BEING AN UNDERDOG AND

143
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:34,353
WORKING HARD TO ACHIEVE WHATEVER
YOU PUT YOUR MIND.

144
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,588
TO.

145
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,356
Jeff: I GET THE WORK ETHIC,
BUT LETS PUT THIS TO THE TEST.

146
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,158
GUY IN THE BACK CORNER, WHATS
YOUR NAME?

147
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,226
PAT.

148
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,628
Jeff: PAT, LETS COMPARE
YOUR STORY VERSUS PATS.

149
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,529
OKAY.

150
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,065
YOU GREW UP WITH WHAT KIND OF A
FAMILY?

151
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,634
I WOULD SAY MIDDLE CLASS TO
UPPER MIDDLE CLASS.

152
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,303
MY DAD IS A PHYSICIAN.

153
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,537
WHAT DO YOU DO?

154
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,905
IM A DOCTOR TOO.

155
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,575
Jeff: OKAY.

156
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,242
PAT.

157
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,477
TELL ME ABOUT HOW YOU GREW UP?

158
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,212
WERE YOU UPPER MIDDLE CLASS?

159
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,514
NO, FAR FROM THAT.

160
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,350
I COME FROM A
PAYCHECK-TO-PAYCHECK FAMILY.

161
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,587
MY MOTHER WAS PARALYZED WHEN I
WAS NINE YEARS OLD.

162
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,423
MY FATHER WAS A FIREMAN AND A
POLICE OFFICER.

163
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,559
BUT EVERY PAYCHECK THAT HE
HAD HAD TO GO TO BILLS BECAUSE

164
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,863
HE WAS THE SOLE BREADWINNER.

165
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,365
Jeff: WAS MEDICAL SCHOOL AN
OPTION?

166
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,033
MEDICAL SCHOOL?

167
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,401
COLLEGE WASNT EVEN AN OPTION.

168
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,004
I WENT RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
TO THE WORKING FIELD.

169
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,773
Jeff: AS A GROUP HERE, DO
WE ALL AGREE ON THE PREMISE,

170
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,275
THIS ISNT ABOUT HARD WORK.

171
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,111
YOU DONT BECOME A DOCTOR
WITHOUT WORKING HARD.

172
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,448
THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK AT
LIFE AN HUH LIFE HAS STARTED FOR

173
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,649
YOU.

174
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,418
OFTEN THE ADVANTAGE THE GOLIATH
HAS IS VISIBLE.

175
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,189
YOU CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT
SOMEBODY OR BY TALKING TO

176
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,357
SOMEBODY THEYRE A GOLIATH.

177
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,628
ON THE DAVID TRIBE, OFTEN THE
ADVANTAGE IS INVISIBLE.

178
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,498
BUT UNTIL YOU KNOW THE
SITUATION, YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO

179
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,767
DEFINE THE ADVANTAGE.

180
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,405
THE QUESTION THIS SEASON IS
WHICH ONE OF YOU IS THE BEST AT

181
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:04,176
TURNING EVERY SITUATION INTO ONE
THAT GIVES YOU THE ADVANTAGE.

182
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,146
THAT PERSON WILL WIN THIS GAME.

183
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,983
SO LETS START WITH A LITTLE
EXPERIMENT ON THIS IDEA OF

184
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,351
CAPITALIZING ON ADVANTAGE.

185
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,388
LETS GO WITH THE PREMISE THAT
OUT OF THE GATE THE GOLIATHS ARE

186
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,589
THE FAVORITES.

187
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,559
GOLIATH TRIBE, CHOOSE WHO YOU
THINK IS THE WEAKEST WOMAN AND

188
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,261
THE WEAKEST MAN ON THE DAVID
TRIBE.

189
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,465
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

190
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,535
Jeff: BIG EARLY DECISION
TRYING TO MAXIMIZE A CHALLENGE.

191
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,770
WHO DID YOU DECIDE ON?

192
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:37,043
WERE GOING TO GO WITH PURPLE
HAIR AND BIG BANG THEORY.

193
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,713
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, THATS
YOU, AND LYRSA.

194
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,784
LYRSA, TAKE A STEP UP NEXT TO
CHRISTIAN RIGHT THERE.

195
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,487
LIE -- LYRSA, HOW DOES THAT
FEEL?

196
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,289
IM NOT SURPRISED.

197
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,426
IM ALWAYS SEEN AS THE WEAKEST
PERSON BECAUSE IM TINY, BECAUSE

198
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,429
IM A LITTLE BIT CHUNKY, BECAUSE
IM NOT FROM HERE.

199
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,830
Jeff: WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

200
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,031
PUERTO RICO.

201
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,900
Jeff: AND CHRISTIAN, ARE
YOU SURPRISED THEY CHOSE YOU AS

202
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,402
THE WEAKEST MALE?

203
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,839
IT SEEMS LICK A LOGICAL
DEDUCTION BASED UPON WHAT THEY

204
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,610
SEE, BUT PERHAPS APPEARANCES ARE
DECEIVING.

205
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,746
Jeff: NOW LETS TRY TO
EXTEND YOUR ADVANTAGE.

206
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,949
GOLIATH TRIBE, NOW CHOOSE WHO
YOU THINK IS YOUR STRONGEST MAN

207
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,117
AND YOUR STRONGEST WOMAN.

208
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:26,192
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR MAXIMUM
DISPARITY IN THESE MATCHUPS.

209
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:26,759
ALL RIGHT.

210
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,328
WHO DID YOU DECIDE ON?

211
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,262
ALISON IS THE WOMAN.

212
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,197
WHO IS THE MAN?

213
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,932
MAYOR OF SLAM TOWN.

214
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,969
Jeff: JOHN, RIGHT HERE IN
THE FRONT.

215
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,776
FAIR TO SAY AT THIS POINT THE
GOLIATHS SHOULD HAVE THE

216
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,910
ADVANTAGE.

217
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,214
THEY HAVE CHOSEN THE WEAKEST
DAVID AND THE STRONGEST FROM

218
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:48,914
THEIR TRIBE.

219
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,117
THE ALLEGEDLY WEAKEST DAVID.

220
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,517
ALLEGEDLY.

221
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,218
Jeff: OKAY.

222
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,154
NOW PART TWO OF THIS EXPERIMENT.

223
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,891
LETS GIVE THE DAVIDS A CHANCE
TO TILT THE FAVOR TO THEIR SIDE.

224
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,393
WE ARE GOING TO RUN A CHALLENGE.

225
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,827
THE TWO PAIRS WILL COMPETE.

226
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,198
THE DAVID TRIBE IS NOW GOING TO
CHOOSE WHICH PATH THE GOLIATHS

227
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,735
HAVE TO TAKE AND WHICH PATH THEY
GET TO TAKE.

228
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,705
SO NOW THE DAVID TRIBE IS GOING
TO DO THE SAME THING.

229
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,676
YOU WANT TO PUT ALISON AND JOHN
ON WHAT YOU THINK WILL BE THE

230
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,413
MOST DIFFICULT THING FOR THEM TO
COMPLETE AND PUT YOURSELVES ON

231
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,347
THE EASIEST.

232
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,483
HERES HOW IT WORKS.

233
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,818
THE FIRST STAGE IS BALANCE.

234
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:34,193
YOU HAVE YOUR CHOICE BETWEEN A
BEAM OVER WATER, A PLANK BRIDGE

235
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,628
OR A TWO-PERSON TRACK.

236
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,063
THE NEXT STAGE IS AGILITY.

237
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,700
YOU HAVE YOUR CHOICE BETWEEN THE
NET TUBE, THE ROPE TUNNEL, AND

238
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,602
THE CRAWL UNDER.

239
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,639
THE THIRD STAGE YOU HAVE YOUR
CHOICE BETWEEN A 15-PIECE CUBE

240
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:53,879
PUZZLE, AN EIGHT-PIECE SLIDE
PUZZLE, OR TRANSFERRING 30

241
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:58,084
SANDBAGS FROM ONE PLATFORM TO
ANOTHER.

242
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,454
WHEN YOU REACH THE END, ONE
PERSON WILL CRAWL OUT TO RELEASE

243
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,723
A MASSIVE SHELTER-MAKING KIT.

244
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,326
FIRST TO RELEASE IT GETS IT FOR
THEIR TRIBE.

245
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,260
ALL RIGHT.

246
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,495
DAVIDS.

247
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:15,134
GET TOGETHER, FIGURE OUT WHAT
DECISIONS YOURE GOING TO MAKE.

248
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,068
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

249
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,603
LETS HAVE A DECISION.

250
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:21,574
SO LYRSA, WHAT DID YOU CHOOSE
FOR THE GOLAITH TRIBE TO RUN?

251
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,076
SO THEYRE GOING TO DO THE
PLANKS.

252
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,643
Jeff: PLANK BRIDGE?

253
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:25,778
YES.

254
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:32,451
THEN THEYRE GOING TO DO
THE NET AND THE 15 BLOCKS.

255
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,687
Kris: Jeff: THE CUBE PUZZLE
 YES.

256
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,490
Jeff: WHAT DID YOU CHOOSE
FOR YOURSELF?

257
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,825
WERE GOING TO DO THE BEAM.

258
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:40,926
Jeff: BEAM OVER THE WATER.

259
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,528
WERE GOING TO GO UNDER.

260
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,697
Jeff: THE CRAWL UNDER.

261
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,199
AND WERE GOING TO DO THE
OTHER PUZZLE.

262
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,335
Jeff: THE EIGHT-PIECE SLIDE
PUZZLE.

263
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:53,506
IT IS OUR FIRST REWARD
CHALLENGE.

264
00:12:53,539 --> 00:13:00,813
LETS GET TO IT.

265
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:07,353
HERE WE GO, FOR REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY?

266
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:12,158
GO!

267
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,392
OUT OF THE GATE LYRSA AND
CHRISTIAN ON THE BEAM OVER

268
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,593
WATER.

269
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,395
LYRSA ALL THE WAY BACK, SO IS
CHRISTIAN.

270
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,197
THEYRE GOING TO FALL IN!

271
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,999
THEYRE GOING TO FALL IN!

272
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,502
Jeff: ITS RISK KIM YOU
LEAN TOO FAR OUT, YOU CANT GET

273
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:23,903
BACK.

274
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:24,737
SLOW DOWN.

275
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,504
DONT FALL.

276
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,708
Jeff: LYRSA WAY BACK.

277
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,812
THERE GOES ALISON AND JOHN WITH
THE PLANK BRIDGE COVERING A LOT

278
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:37,016
OF GROUND FAST.

279
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,552
THE DAVIDS ARE MOVING QUICKLY.

280
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,021
LYRALYRSA IS THROUGH.

281
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,923
CHRISTIAN IS THROUGH.

282
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,926
JOHN AND ALISON WORKING TOGETHER
NICELY WITH THIS PLANK BRIDGE.

283
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,429
IT IS NOT EASY, BUT THEY HAVE A
GOOD MOMENTUM.

284
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,432
LYRSA AND CHRISTIAN NOW IN THE
CRAWL UNDER AND ITS TAKING THEM

285
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,167
MORE TIME THAN THEY MAY HAVE
ANTICIPATED.

286
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,203
PUSH WITH YOUR FEET!

287
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,239
PUSH WITH YOUR FEET, CHRISTIAN!

288
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,407
Jeff: ALISON IS THROUGH.

289
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,608
JOHN IS THROUGH.

290
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:03,309
GO!

291
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,009
YOU GOT A CHALLENGE.

292
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,147
THERE GOES ALISON.

293
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,316
LYRSA IS THROUGH.

294
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:15,688
BUT THE GOLIATHS ARE MAKING UP A
LOT OF TIME NOW.

295
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,790
CHRISTIAN IS NOW THROUGH.

296
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,925
GET THE PUZZLE PIECES.

297
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,229
Jeff: ITS GOING TO COME
DOWN TO THE PUZZLE.

298
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,864
CHRISTIAN WORKING ON THE SLIDE
PUZZLE.

299
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,498
THEY CAN BE TRICKY.

300
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,969
JOHN AND ALISON ON THE CUBE.

301
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,403
CHRISTIAN!

302
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:31,804
CHRISTIAN!

303
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:35,908
CHRISTIAN!

304
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:39,612
Jeff: OUT OF NOWHERE,
DAVIDS HAVE THE SLIDE PUZZLE IN

305
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,547
LESS THAN FIVE SECONDS.

306
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,884
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS OVER.

307
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:50,823
DAVIDS, DAVIDS, DAVIDS!

308
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,759
Jeff: LYRSA NOW GOING TO
CLOSE IT OUT.

309
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,261
DAVIDS WIN EARLY REWARD.

310
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,662
SEE THAT?

311
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,198
DAVID STOMPS GOLIATH ROUND ONE.

312
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:08,741
Jeff: THAT WAS A BLOWOUT.

313
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,543
CHRISTIAN, THE BIG DECISION YOU
MADE WAS NOT THE PHYSICAL PART,

314
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,381
BECAUSE THAT WAS PRETTY CLOSE,
IT WAS THE PUZZLE YOU CHOSE FOR

315
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,682
YOURSELF.

316
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,685
BECAUSE IVE BEEN ON "SURVIVOR"
FOR A LONG TIME.

317
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,122
IVE SEEN PEOPLE TRY TO DO A
SLIDE PUZZLE AND NEVER GET

318
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,156
ANYWHERE.

319
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:29,595
IN UNDERGRAD, I WROTE SLIDER
PUZZLE ALGORITHMS.

320
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,798
SO I FIGURED WE COULD GO THAT
WAY.

321
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,502
Jeff: GABBY, THIS IS REALLY
WHY THAT STORY OF DAVID VERSUS

322
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,839
GOLIATH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST
METAPHORS FOR IMPROBABLE

323
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,243
VICTORY, BECAUSE WHO WOULD EVER
GUESS THAT SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE

324
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,112
WRITTEN ALGORITHMS FOR A SLIDE
PUZZLE AND THAT WOULD COME INTO

325
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,113
PLAY MINUTES INTO THIS SEASON.

326
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,548
YEAH, EXACTLY.

327
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,183
IM REALLY PROUD OF OUR DAVIDS.

328
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,851
THEY HAD THEIR SECRET WEAPON.

329
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,888
AND THIS WAS A GREAT FIRST
VICTORY.

330
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,557
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, DAVID, OFF
TO FAST START.

331
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,894
HERES MAP TO YOUR NEW HOME.

332
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,163
[APPLAUSE]
THE RAFT IS WAITING FOR YOU.

333
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,264
THE ADVENTURE IS YOURS.

334
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,732
GOOD LUCK.

335
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,802
HEAD OUT.

336
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:13,038
GOLAITH TRIBE, NOT THE RESULT
YOU WANTED, BUT IT IS ONLY DAY

337
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,840
ONE OF A 39-DAY ADVENTURE.

338
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,743
HERES A MAP TO YOUR NEW HOME.

339
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,411
THE RAFT IS WAITING FOR YOU.

340
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,781
GOOD LUCK.

341
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,918
YOU KNOW, ITS FUNNY, ONE
COULD SAY THAT I SLIDE GOLAITH

342
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:31,457
WITH AN ALGO RHYTHM SLINGSHOT,
BUT I GO DIRECTLY TO THE THINGS

343
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,426
I DID WRONG, AND ITS SOMETHING
I NEED TO FIX ABOUT MYSELF, BUT

344
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,729
I DID MAKE A FEW MISTAKES MOVING
AROUND THE PIECES.

345
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,831
I COULD HAVE GONE A SECOND OR
TWO FASTER.

346
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,201
ITS A MATTER, THE LITTLE PIECES
AROUND IT, THERE WAS LIKE A

347
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,270
MOVE, LIKE A LEFT-RIGHT MOVE.

348
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,841
IT HAS TO MOVE AROUND THE BOARD.

349
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,708
I DID IT RIGHT.

350
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,342
WAS THAT GOOD?

351
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,477
I THINK IT WAS GOOD.

352
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,315
MAYBE IT WAS BAD.

353
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:04,990
ROW, ROW!

354
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,493
MY FIRST ASSESSMENT OF THE
TBLIET TRIBE, I WAS PRETTY

355
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,830
STOKED BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE WE
HAD A LOT OF STRONG GUY, A LOT

356
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,698
OF FIT WOMEN.

357
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,101
ITS LIKE, REALLY, THIS IS MY
TEAM?

358
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,505
I MEAN, I CAME TO HOLLYWOOD, AND
IM NOT ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL

359
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:25,644
PEOPLE, LIKE I FELT LIKE I
REALLY HAD TO ALTER MY LIFE BY

360
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,646
WRITING, WRITE, WRITING,
WRITING.

361
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,714
MIKE.

362
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,848
DUDE, WHAT DO YOU DO?

363
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,016
IM A WRITER.

364
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,684
I FEEL LIKE I RECOGNIZE YOU.

365
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:38,357
WERE YOU ON "THE AMAZING RACE
 HES A WRITER.

366
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,958
I KNEW I RECOGNIZED YOU.

367
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,927
IM A DIRECTOR SOMETIMES.

368
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,028
SOMETIMES ACTOR.

369
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,531
IM MOSTLY A WRITER.

370
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,234
I WROTE "SCHOOL OF ROCK" AND
"NACHO LEAK RAY."

371
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,938
I AM MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN I EVER
THOUGHT I WOULD BE, BUT FOR ME I

372
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,673
AM A "SURVIVOR" FANATIC.

373
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,642
EVERYBODY IN MY BUSINESS WANTS
THE OSCAR.

374
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,410
ITS LIKE, LOSERS.

375
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,613
I WANT TO WIN "SURVIVOR."

376
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,383
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD OWN
THEM IN EVERYTHING PHYSICALLY.

377
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,818
I USED TO BE A FAT KID.

378
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,819
I DIDNT SHOW UP LIKE THIS.

379
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,420
I WORKED FOR THIS.

380
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,855
I WORKED TO MAKE THE SWAT TEAM.

381
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,223
I WORKED TO BE A COP.

382
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,291
IT DIDNT JUST HAPPEN.

383
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,192
I WORKED MY TAIL OFF.

384
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,526
NOTHING JUST HAPPENS.

385
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,931
WHEN YOURE A BRAND-NEW COP,
22, OH, I GET HALF OFF AT

386
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:19,431
McDONALDS.

387
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,866
I GET FREE ICIES.

388
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,568
THIS IS PERFECT.

389
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,368
YOU DRINK SODA.

390
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,205
YOU GOT FAT BECAUSE YOU
BECAME...

391
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,675
I WAS BIG BEFORE THEN, BUT I
PUT ON 20 POUNDS MY FIRST YEAR

392
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,709
AS A COP.

393
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,878
AS YOU AGE NATURALLY YOU
START THE GAIN WEIGHT.

394
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,581
SO I WAS LIKE, THIS ISNT
GOING TO WORK FOR ME.

395
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,284
WHEN I BECAME A COP, I TIPPED
THE SCALES AT 320, 340,

396
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,588
SOMEWHERE IN THAT BALLPARK.

397
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,424
YOU COULDNT JUST BE ON OUR SWAT
TEAM AND BE AVERAGE, SO I MADE

398
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,291
THAT MY GOAL.

399
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,027
I COMPLETELY CHAINED MY WORKOUT
PROGRAM.

400
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,195
THE WEIGHT JUST SHED OFF.

401
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,164
I LOST CLOSE TO 100 POUNDS IN A
YEAR.

402
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,233
THEN I TRIED OUT FOR OUR TEAM
AND MADE IT.

403
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,968
YOU LOOK GREAT NOW.

404
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:56,969
THANK YOU.

405
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,604
YOU LOOK FINE, AS A MATTER OF
FACT.

406
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,772
ALL LEANED UP.

407
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,174
COME ON, GIRL.

408
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:02,741
YOU ALREADY SAID IT.

409
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,643
I BUFFED UP FOR THIS.

410
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,647
I PUT ON 15 POUNDS.

411
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,482
OLD DAN, FAT DAN, I NEVER WOULD
HAVE HAD THE CONFIDENCE TO WALK

412
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:14,920
AROUND HERE AND SAY, YES, IM A
GOLAITH, BUT NOW THE MOST

413
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:19,391
BEAUTIFUL GIRL IS TELLING ME IM
VERY GOOD LOOKING, YOU KNOW, SO

414
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,059
I JUST CANT HELP MYSELF.

415
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,529
I CALLED YOU MY KRYPTONITE.

416
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,264
I WAS LIKE, SHES GOING TO GET
ME IN TROUBLE.

417
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,132
YOU KNOW NEW YORK SUPERMAN,

418
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,569
KARA.

419
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,571
I NAMED MY DOG AFTER HER.

420
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,306
WHATS HER NAM?

421
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:34,940
KARA.

422
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,544
NO WAY.

423
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,680
KARA, SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.

424
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:46,351
FIRST TIME I SAW HER, I WAS
LIKE, WOW, RIGHT UP MY ALI, LIKE

425
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,422
EVERYTHING I WOULD WANT IN A
WOMAN, LIKE PERFECT, LIKE WOW.

SO YOURE SAYING IM BLOND

430
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,698
RIGHT UP MY ALI.

431
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,699
OKAY.

432
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,833
IM BLUSHING.

433
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,003
DAN IS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE I
IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED TO.

434
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,239
I CAN TELL HES A GENUINE SOUL.

435
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,576
HES ONE OF THE NICEST PEOPLE
IVE MET.

436
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,879
HES HILARIOUS.

437
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,847
IN MY LIFE, I WAS AN N.F.L.

438
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,481
CHEERLEADER.

439
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,950
IM A REAL ESTATE AGENT NOW.

440
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,851
SO ITS PART OF ME TO BE
CHARMING.

441
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,722
ITS CLEAR THAT HES DRAWN TO
ME, WHICH, OF COURSE, MAKES IT

442
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,391
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOT TO BE
DRAWN TO HIM, TOO.

443
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:31,430
IM SO HAPPY YOURE ON THIS
TRIBE.

444
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,966
DOES THAT MEAN WERE GOING TO
BE THE SHOW MANSLAUGHTER.

445
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:39,004
WE CANT PUT TARGETS ON OUR
BACKS.

446
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,506
WE JUST WONT MAKE IT
OBVIOUS.

447
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,110
YOU CAN KISS ME IN SECRET.

448
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,545
IM LIKE, DONT DO IT, DAN.

449
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,580
SHOW MANSLAUGHTERS SCREW YOU SO
HARD.

450
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,251
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO
FOUND LOVE ON "SURVIVOR," SO WHY

451
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,787
NOT ME?

452
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,822
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

453
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,091
TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND OFF.

454
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,025
YEAH, WERE HERE.

455
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,363
ONE, TWO, THREE.

456
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:10,802
REAL QUICK, WHOEVER KNOWS HOW TO
DO FRONDS.

457
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,405
I AM A PROPERTY MANAGER FOR 365
APARTMENTS.

458
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,407
I SWING A HAMMER EVERY DAY OF MY
LIFE.

459
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,174
OH, GOOD.

460
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,378
WELL HAVE SHELTER IN NO
TIME.

461
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,981
ITS A REALLY EXCITING MOMENT
IN SURVIVOR WHEN YOU FIRST GET

462
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:27,219
TO CAMP, BUT ITS ALSO A SIGNAL
THAT GAME ON, YOU GOT TO WORK.

463
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,621
SHOULD WE SPLIT IT DOWN THE
MIDDLE?

464
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,690
I THINK WE SHOULD GATHER
FIRST.

465
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,427
I THINK EVERYONE ON THE DAVID
TRIBE IS GOING TO BE WAY MORE

466
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,698
COHESIVE THAN THE GOLAITH TRIBE,
BECAUSE OUR ADVANTAGE IS WE ARE

467
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,567
SCRAPPY AND WE KNOW THAT TO
SUCCEED WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER

468
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,637
AND USE EACH OTHER TO SUCCEED IN
THIS GAME.

469
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,974
I ALWAYS FOOD ITS ALWAYS A
TRICKY PART.

470
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,642
ITS A CHALLENGE TO EARN IT.

471
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,411
ITS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE TO
OPEN THE SON OF A GUN.

472
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,645
YOURE NOT KIDLING.

473
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,049
SO IM THINKING WELL BUILD
OUR SHELTER OVER THERE BECAUSE

474
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,317
THERE IS NATURAL CANOPY.

475
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:58,984
I NEED.

476
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,452
THIS SHES WORKING ON THAT.

477
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,289
BEING ON THE DAVID TRIBE, THAT
MOST CERTAINLY FITS ME.

478
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:04,890
IM SELF-MADE.

479
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,058
I STRUGGLED MY WHOLE LIFE.

480
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,559
IM A BLUE COLLAR GUY.

481
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:12,364
WHAT IM THINKING HERE, WERE
GOING TO SPAN THIS TO THAT.

482
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:16,168
AND BEING BROUGHT UP THE WAY I
WAS, IT SEASONED ME TO PREPARE

483
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,803
ME FOR EVERYDAY LIFE.

484
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:23,542
THE OVERHANG ON THIS BEAM IS
GOING TO SUPPORT THAT END.

485
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:28,046
LET ME SEE HOW THEYRE GOING
OVER THERE.

486
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,414
CARL, WHERES THAT CORDAGE?

487
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,717
PAT IMMEDIATELY TAKES LEAD OF
THE SHELTER.

488
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:37,222
ILL MAKE A MARK HERE ON THIS
TREE.

489
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:43,795
NOW, PAT CAN BE A BIT --
 EXTEND THIS CORNER OUT THE

490
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:44,162
THERE.

491
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,097
RIGHT THERE.

492
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,332
THATS WHERE WERE GOING TO PUT
THAT CLEAT.

493
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:51,670
-- DIRECTIVE WHERE HE WANTS
PEOPLE.

494
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,672
CHRISTIAN; WHERE YOU AT?

495
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,107
WERE GOING TO NEED MORE BAMBOO.

496
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,542
IN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE THERE
ARE PEOPLE WITH STRONG

497
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,679
PERSONALITIES WHO CONFLICT, BUT,
MAN, I DONT THINK IVE EVER HAD

498
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,714
MY NAME SHOUTED LIKE THAT IN A
PROFESSIONAL SETTING.

499
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:03,915
PUSH DOWN ON IT.

500
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:08,887
THERE YOU GO, DONT SNAP IT.

501
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,222
BAMBOO IS WHAT WE NEED RIGHT
NOW.

502
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,091
I GOT THE SENSE THAT OTHER
PEOPLE FELT A LITTLE BIT BOSSED

503
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,059
AROUND BY PAT.

504
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,596
SWEATING LIKE A PREGNANT NUN
AT CONFESSION.

505
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,632
I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT,
JOKES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY.

506
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,801
ONCE YOU SEE THE CRACK, YOU
NEVER GO BACK.

507
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,035
A JOKE CAN FAIL.

508
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:29,341
YOU DIRTY BITCH.

509
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,976
ID GIVE MY LEFT NUT TO BE 36.

510
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,412
I THINK PEOPLE WERE WILLING
TO PUT UP WITH IT AS LONG AS

511
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,846
WERE GETTING A SHELTER BUILT.

512
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,014
IS THAT LONG ENOUGH TO REACH?

513
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,183
I DONT HAVE GOOD DEPTH
PERCEPTION.

514
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,486
IF HE WERE NOT SUCCEEDING IN THE
SHELTER, HE WOULD BE IN REAL

515
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,187
TROUBLE.

516
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,222
I THINK THATS THE KEY, KID.

517
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,901
LETS GET THE SHELTER BUILT
FIRST.

518
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,468
WE KNOW ITS GOING TO RAIN.

519
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,235
ALL RIGHT.

520
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,171
LETS GO FIND SOME BIG TREE
LIMBS.

521
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,840
HERES ONE.

522
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:02,774
ITS FREEZING COLD.

523
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,075
WEVE GOT TO BUILD A SHELTER OUT
OF NOTHING.

524
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,547
WE GOT ONE MACHETE AND THATS
IT, BUT LOOKING AT THE BRIGHT

525
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,852
SIDE OF THINGS AND MAKING LIGHT
OUT OF A REALLY BAD SITUATION IS

526
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,821
THE QUALITY IN A GOLAITH.

527
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,990
WHAT ARE WE SITTING ON, PALM
FRONDS.

528
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,326
DO WE HAVE ANY MORE OF THESE?

529
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,329
I DONT KNOW IF THERES ONE
THATS THIS TALL.

530
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,565
I THINK WE HAVE THE KEEP THAT
OTHER ONE TO KEEP EVERYTHING

531
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,566
DRY.

532
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,668
ITS AN ADJUSTMENT OUT HERE
BECAUSE IM OLDER.

533
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:30,469
IM 57.

534
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,703
THEYRE 25.

535
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:36,374
SO LETS BUILD A BASE AND
SAVE BAMBOO FOR THE BEAMS.

536
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,943
WE CAN SAVE THE GREEN ONE FOR
THE BEAMS.

537
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:42,113
I RECOMMEND THAT WE DO IT
SMALLER BECAUSE WERE OUT OF

538
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,315
TIME.

539
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,549
I HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR
ME, SO SIMILARLY WITH THESE

540
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,854
YOUNGER PEOPLE ON THE TRIBE, I
PUT OUT WHAT I THINK BECAUSE I

541
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,555
AM ACCUSTOMED TO BEING IN
CHARGE.

542
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:55,293
TWO BIG ONES GOING UP.

543
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,595
SO WE NEED A BASE HERE.

544
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,131
I JUST NEED YOU TO SLOW DOWN
A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE YOURE NOT

545
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,299
LISTENING TO PEOPLE.

546
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,468
YOURE JUST MOVING REALLY FAST,
AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

547
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,871
I AM AN INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER.

548
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:09,441
IM HERE TO BUILD A SHELTER AND
HELP OUT, HOWEVER, WE HAVE

549
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:13,278
NATALIE, WHO IS VERY STRONG, AND
SHE REALLY LIKES TO GIVE ORDERS.

550
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:17,182
WE NEED TO BIG A BIT OF A
HOLE AND THEN WE NEED TO GET A

551
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,252
ROCK WHERE WE CAN HAMMER THAT
INTO THE GROUND AND MATCH THE

552
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,353
HEIGHT OF THAT.

553
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,522
SHE IS NOT AFRAID TO TELL YOU
WHAT SHE IS THINKING.

554
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:28,493
LADIES, HELLO, I THINK YOU
WANT TO GET YOUR FRONDS AND PUT

555
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,594

CLEARLY BARKING ORDERS AT ME
AND ERR TRIBE MEMBERS.

557
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,965
SHES DEFINITELY PUT A TARGET ON
HER BACK.

558
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:42,240
LETS KEEP IT PUSHING, COME
ON.

559
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:47,045

563
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,650
IM FROM NEW YORK.

564
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,218
THEY DONT HAVE TREES IN NEW
YORK.

565
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,488
TREES, WE GOT LOTS OF TREES.

566
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:00,025
WE GOT THE BEST COLOR FOLIAGE IN
THE NATION.

567
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:00,759
WATCH YOUR HEAD.

568
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,426
WATCH YOUR HEAD.

569
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,761
OH, MY GOD.

570
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,997
ARE YOU OKAY?

571
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,099
TEAM DAVID!

572
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:08,700
LETS DO IT.

573
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,936
TAKE THIS ONE.

574
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,504
BEND IT LIKE THAT.

575
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:17,842
I WAS KIND OF NERVOUS, BUT BY
THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE A

576
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:18,476
GOOD FOUNDATION.

577
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,711
WERE GOING TO HAVE SHELTER.

578
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,513
IT KIND OF GIVES ME A SIGH OF
RELIEF.

579
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,882
WHERE DID YOU LEARN HOW TO DO
THIS?

580
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,216
YOUTUBE.

581
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,085
IM 19 YEARS OLD.

582
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,019
NOBODY KNOWS THAT.

583
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,221
THEY THINK THAT IM 22.

584
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:34,159
SO MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE WOULD BE
MY AGE, JUST BECAUSE I DONT

585
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,895
WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THAT IM
NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PLAY THIS

586
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,263
GAME.

587
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,297
IM DOWN FOR WHATEVER.

588
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,934
IF WE MAKE ANY CONNECTIONS,
ILL LET YOU KNOW.

589
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,169
YEAH.

590
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,838
SO IM GOING TO TRY TO MAKE
AS MANY ALLIANCES AS I POSSIBLY.

591
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,007
CAN.

592
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,775
WERE GOOD 100%.

593
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,345
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP IT 100
WITH ME, ILL KEEP IT 100 WITH

594
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,212
YOU.

595
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,480
IM NOT GOING TO GO BEHIND
YOUR BACK.

596
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,415
I HAVE A WIFE AND TWO
DAUGHTERS.

597
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,984
JESSICA REMINDS ME OF MY
DAUGHTER.

598
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:03,688
I KNEW I COULD TAKE HER UNDER MY
WING AND MOLD HER IN THE SENSE

599
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,156
OF HOW I WOULD LIKE THE PLAY THE
GAME.

600
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,558
WERE HERE.

601
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,060
WE CANNOT MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
WERE HERE.

602
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:12,364
ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO WIN
CHALLENGES SO WE DONT GO TO

603
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,666
TRIBAL, BUT IF THATS NOT THE
CASE --

604
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,103
IVE EATEN WORMS FOR NO ODD
REASON, JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE

605
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,304
THERE TO EAT.

606
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,874
SOME PEOPLE ARE ALREADY
GETTING UNDER MY SKIN.

607
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,809
BUT RIGHT NOW, LET HIM PUT US
TOGETHER A SHELTER.

608
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,380
I CAME INTO THIS GAME THINKING
THAT I WAS GOING TO BE LAID

609
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,716
BACK, BUT I SEE EVERYONE ELSE
APPROACHING PEOPLE, SO THAT KIND

610
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:39,824
OF LETS ME KNOW, OKAY, THE DAVID
TEAM IS HERE THE PLAY THIS GAME.

613
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,598
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, MAN?

614
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,701
HARDLY.

615
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:53,371
FROM ALL THE PEOPLE OVER,
THERE I LIKE THEM, THEYRE COOL,

616
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,041
BUT I TRUST YOU.

617
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,576
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT THINKING
THAT WED WORK TOGETHER.

618
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,244
I KNOW.

619
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,746
BUT THATS THE REASON.

620
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,681
WERE SO DIFFERENT.

621
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,381
EXACTLY.

622
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,749
THEY WOULD NEVER SUSPECT US.

623
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,586
THE STRONGEST CONNECTION I
HAVE IS ELIZABETH.

624
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,356
THAT KIND OF SURPRISED ME,
BECAUSE WERE SO DIFFERENT.

625
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,291
I MEAN, SHES A COWGIRL.

626
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,327
IM A PUNK ROCKER LESBIAN.

627
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,530
WERE SO DIFFERENT, BUT AT THE
SAME TIME I THINK WERE

628
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:22,801
CONNECTING ON THE SAME LEVEL OF
LOYALTY AND TRUST AND HONESTY

629
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,369
AND RESPECT FOR THE GAME.

630
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,237
ANYTHING YOU NEED, I WILL LET
YOU KNOW.

631
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,273
I WILL DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

632
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,208
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

633
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,277
IM REALLY LOYAL.

634
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,779
IM A BIT OF A WEIRDO.

635
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:39,684
IF I DO -- IF I GET TOO SAUCY
WITH THE WEIRD STUFF, JUST TELL

636
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,285
ME.

637
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,052
I LOVE IT.

638
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,387
I THINK ITS ENDEARING.

639
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,655
I WILL.

640
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,692
ILL LET YOU KNOW IF YOURE TOO
MUCH, BUT IM NERDY, TOO, I GET

641
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,526
IT.

642
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,028
NERDS HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH
OTHER.

643
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,564
NOT TO CALL YOU A NERD, BUT I
CALL MYSELF A NERD.

644
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,667
IF THERE EVER WAS A MORE APT
TERM.

645
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,871
I FEEL LIKE CHRISTIAN AN I
ARE KINDRED SPIRITS.

646
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,239
I LOVE THAT GUY.

647

MEANS THAT I WRITE DOCUMENTATION

FOR SOFTWARE.

649
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:13,084
SO I CONSIDER MYSELF THE NERD
WHISPERER.

650
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,853
IF IT BENDS, ITS NOT DRY.

651
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,422
YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT BECAUSE
YOURE THE SCIENCE GUY.

652
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,356

I HAVE TO HIDE HOW WELL WE

00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,658
IT TO BE A COUPLE THREAT.

672
00:29:53,691 --> 00:30:02,967
A PLATONIC COUPLE THREAT, OF
COURSE.

673

FOR YOUR WORK, ARE YOU... DO

DO YOU HAVE A MASK?

682
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,754
THEY HAVE MASKS, AND I TELL

00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,622
RING ARE GOING TO WIN THE GAME
OF "SURVIVOR."

693
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,623
IM PLAYING AS JOHN.

694
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,960
IM PLAYING AS ME.

695
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:05,964
IM SO COLD, YOU GUYS.

696
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,833
HOW DOES NATALIE NOT EVER
HELP.

697
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,470
SHE JUST STANDS THERE AND STARES
AT EVERYBODY LIKE A STALKER.

698
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,805
ITS REALLY CREEPING ME OUT.

699
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,773
SHE JUST STANDS THERE AND STARES
AT EVERYBODY.

700
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,308
SHE DOESNT HELP OUT WITH
ANYTHING.

701
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,878
SHE DOESNT HELP OUT WITH A
SINGLE THING.

702
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,014
ONLY BARKING ORDERS AND SHE JUST
STANDS THERE AND STARES AND

703
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:23,648
COMPLAINS.

704
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,651
IVE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE.

705
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,319
IT PUTS A TARGET ON HER BACK.

706
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:28,686
I DONT CARE.

707
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,957
I AGREE.

708
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:37,362
GETTING AN IMMUNITY IDOL
WOULD BE PROBABLY ONE OF THE TOP

709
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,564
FIVE BUCKET LIST "SURVIVOR"
MOMENTS.

710
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:47,272
SO OF COURSE IM GOING TO GO
LOOK FOR IT.

711
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:52,243
IM GOING TO GRAB A ROCK.

712
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,378
WHERES MIKE?

713
00:31:53,411 --> 00:32:00,551
HES BEEN GONE FOR A LONG
TIME.

714
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:05,657
CLEARLY EVERYONE IS SO CAUGHT
UP IN THEIR SOCIAL GAME RIGHT

715
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:12,397
NOW THAT THEYRE NOT AWARE THAT
I MIGHT BE SLIPPING OFF TO LOOK

716
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,898
FOR AN IDOL.

717
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,400
WHERE MIKE AT?

718
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,735
ILL BRING HIM BACK.

719
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,203
SERIOUSLY...

720
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,739
ARE WE JUST GOING TO LET HIM
LOOK FOR AN IDOL?

721
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,142
AT LEAST ONE OF US HAS TO GO
OUT THERE.

722
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:27,578
IM GOING TO GO LOOK FOR HIM.

723
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,347
IM A LITTLE DOWN FOR THE
COUNT.

724
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,516
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, THESE
PEOPLE THAT KEEP DISAPPEARING,

725
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,718
THEYRE SETTING THEMSELVES UP
FOR FAILURE.

726
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:37,956
MIKE HAD A TARGET BECAUSE WE SAW
MIKE ON "THE AMAZING RACE" HE

727
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,858
WROTE "SCHOOL OF ROCK," WE KNOW
HE HAS MONEY.

728
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:46,030
LOOKING FOR THE IDOL GAVE PEOPLE
A GOOD REASON.

729
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,900
SO SOMEBODY SAID, WHO DO YOU
WANT TO TAKE OUT FIRST?

730
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,069
WHO IS GOING TO CAUSE MORE
PROBLEMS AT CAMP?

731
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,305
NATALIE.

732
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,139
SHES...

733
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,574
HES A LOT MORE SLICK THAN
NATALIE.

734
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,308
HES SCARY.

735
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,609
HES SCARY GOOD.

736
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,144
ITS SO EARLY.

737
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,982
I THINK THAT MIKE PUT A
LITTLE BIT OF TARGET ON HIS BACK

738
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:07,085
BY GOING OUT AND LOOKING FOR AN
IDOL.

739
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,655
I ALSO GET MIXED VIBES FROM
NATALIE.

740
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:14,225
WE DONT HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS
YET, BUT WHEN WE DO, WE HAVE

741
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:14,892
OPTIONS.

742
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,094
CAN WE GO TO THE BEACH NOW?

743
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,395
I WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH.

744
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,297
YOURE PUTTING TARGET ON YOUR
BACK?

745
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,098
REALLY?

746
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:23,634
REALLY.

747
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,472
WHY DO YOU KEEP DISAPPEARING?

748
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,440
IF YOU DO, YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
TALK TO SOMEBODY ABOUT WHAT YOU

749
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,875
DID.

750
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:35,046
I WENT TO GET MY SHOES.

751
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,215
EVERYONES LIKE, WHERES
MIKE?

752
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,018
I FOUND OUT I PUT A TARGET ON
MY BACK WHEN I RAN INTO NATALIE.

753
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,388
SHE SAID, YOU HAVE A TARGET ON
YOUR BIKE.

754
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,722
YOUVE BEEN GONE TOO LONG.

755
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:49,861
EVERYONE KNOWS YOURE LOOKING
FOR AN IDOL.

756
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:53,798
I WENT FOR THE IMMUNITY IDOL NOT
BECAUSE I NEED IT, BUT BECAUSE I

757
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:54,966
WANT IT.

758
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,335
I JUST GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE
EXCITEMENT OF IT AND ENDED UP

759
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,238
BEING HOISTED BY MY OWN PETARD.

760
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,225
IT LITERALLY IS NOT STOPPING.

761
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,126
NO.

762
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,462
NO, NO, NO.

763
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:31,235
IM NOT DOING THAT.

764
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,136
SQUEEZE IN THERE.

765
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,638
HANG IT.

766
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:37,308
GOT IT.

767
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,411
YALL ARE AWESOME.

768
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,014
WE HAD A ROUGH FIRST NIGHT
WITH ALL THE RAIN.

769
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,348
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

770
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:48,186
WEVE GOT THE ROYAL TREATMENT
FROM THE ISLAND AS FOR AS THE

771
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:48,953
WEATHER GOES.

772
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,622
THERE IS NO INITIATION WITH
THIS.

773
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,857
HOLD THEM RIGHT THERE,
CHRISTIAN.

774
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,194
I THINK SOMETIMES THE STRUGGLE
IS WHAT MAKES SOMEONE WHO THEY

775
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,028
ARE.

776
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,329
WHAT ELSE DO I NEED FOR THE
SHELTER?

777
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:02,400
WERE JUST ADDING MORE AND
MORE FRONDS.

778
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,204
BEING A DAVID, WE CARE WAY MORE
ABOUT EACH OTHER WAY MORE THAN

779
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,138
GOLAITHS CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

780
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,139
DRYING UP NIGHT?

781
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,941
YEAH, IT FEELS REALLY GOOD.

782
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:13,711
WHEN YOUVE BEEN IN THE
STRUGGLE, YOU TEND TO EMPATHIZE

783
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,414
AND CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THOSE WHO
ARE AROUND YOU.

784
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,218
ITS INBRED INTO A DAVID TO CARE
ABOUT THE OTHER DAVIDS.

785
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,186
I FEEL LIKE TONIGHT WONT BE
AS BAD.

786
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,422
TONIGHT WILL BE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STORY.

787
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,490
IT WAS ROUGH.

788
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,657
IT WAS REALLY ROUGH LAST NIGHT.

789
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,759
IT DOESNT LOOK LIKE THIS IS
STOPPING.

790
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,294
I PROMISE THEYRE NOT DOING
AS GOOD AS US.

791
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,698
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF
COOL PEOPLE ON THAT TRIBE, SO

792
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:34,699
IM NOT ROOTING AGAINST THEM.

793
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,501
I HOPE THEY GO THROUGH HELL.

794
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,368
YOU HOPE WHAT?

795
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,104
I HOPE THEY GO THROUGH HELL.

796
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:45,076
ITS VERY EASY TO AVOID WORK IF
YOURE GOOD AT IT.

797
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,513
I DONT WANT THE WASTE MY ENERGY
BUILDING A SHELTER.

798
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:49,580
HOLY CRAP.

799
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,517
I THINK IT STOPPED RAINING.

800
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,551
IM ON "SURVIVOR."

801
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,487
THE ONLY THING ON MY MIND IS
SCHEMING AND PLOTTING.

802
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,523
I HAVE TO FIND MY FLOCK OF
SHEEP.

803
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:03,661
THIS IS COOL.

804
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:07,765
ITS VERY EASY TO GET PEOPLE
TO TRUST YOU ON "SURVIVOR."

805
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,700
ITS ALMOST TOO EASY.

806
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,270
AS SOON AS I HEARD YOU SAY,
THAT I THOUGHT, SHES PROBABLY

807
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,137
FROM KENTUCKY.

808
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,840
IT DEFINITELY WORKED OUT IN
OUR FAVOR.

809
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,875
FOR REAL, FOR REAL.

810
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:23,481
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE
THINGS OFFICIAL AND MAKE THAT

811
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,718
PERSON FEEL LIKE YOU GOT A GOOD
BOND, YOUR ALLIANCE HAS AN NAME.

812
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,220
WE NEED AN ALLIANCE NAME.

813
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,388
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

814
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,757
ILL THINK OF SOMETHING.

815
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,457
OKAY.

816
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,225
THINK OF SOMETHING.

817
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:37,695
IM NOT REAL SMART.

818
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,398
IF I CAN IN THIS GAME, I WANT
THE NAME ALL THE ALLIANCE,

819
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,000
BECAUSE IM OUT HERE TO WIN $1
MILLION, BUT IM OUT HERE TO

820
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:47,171
HAVE FUN, TOO.

821
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,509
I THINK OUR SHELTER IS GOOD
RIGHT NOW.

822
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,312
I DONT THINK THATS IN OUR
CADS FOR TODAY.

823
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,347
WE DID AN AMAZING JOB.

824
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:02,420
PAT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OVER
THE TOP, BUT PAT WAS A GIFT AS

825
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,322
FAR AS PUTTING THAT SHELTER UP.

826
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,659
BUT SINCE WEVE BEEN HERE, NICK
HASNT REALLY DONE MUCH OF

827
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,427
ANYTHING.

828
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,095
I CANT STAND MAN THAT DONT
WORK.

829
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,464
BEING A TRUCK DRIVER, THERES
TIME I COULDNT STOP TO GET

830
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,665
FOOD.

831
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,268
I MEAN, I HAD TO GET THAT LOAD
TO WHERE IT NEEDED TO BE, SO I

832
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,338
CANT STAND LAZY-ASS PEOPLE.

833
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,974
I CANT DIG THAT.

834
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,475
HES NUMBER-ONE ON MY LIST.

835
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,409
ME TOO.

836
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:39,724
WE GOOD WITH THAT.

837
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,669
SO HERES MY THING.

838
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:56,340
NOT ENOUGH WOMEN FIND ANGLES.

839
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,076
I CAME INTO THIS THINKING THE
SAME THING.

840
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,680
IMED A MAN WE NEED THE
CHANGE THAT.

841
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,916
WE TEND TO THE FIRE AND WE COOK
THE FOOD, AND WERE PUTTING

842
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,051
OURSELVES AT A DISADVANTAGE.

843
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,287
WHEREAS THE MEN GO OUT AND
EXPLORE AND FIND THE FIREWOOD

844
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,454
AND WHATEVER.

845
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,857
IDOLS ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS
GAME BECAUSE THEYRE A HUGE

846
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,991
ADVANTAGE.

847
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,128
AND WOMEN TEND TO NOT FIND
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS AS MUCH.

848
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,398
WE NEED TO DO THIS.

849
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,567
CAN YOU STAND AND WATCH WHILE
I LOOK AT THAT BRANCH OVER

850
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:23,868
THERE?

851
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:24,969
100%.

852
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:25,903
ITS IS HARD.

853
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,039
THERE ARE SO MANY DAMN TREES.

854
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,240
USE A STICK.

855
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:32,410
I WAS READING ONLINE THAT 15%
OF ALL HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS

856
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:36,814
HAVE BEEN FOUND BY WOMEN, AND WE
KNOW THAT "SURVIVOR" PLAYS MEN

857
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:40,384
AND WOMEN EQUALLY, SO WE SHOULD
BE FINDING IDOLS EQUALLY.

858
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,586
SO I WANT TO HELP BOOST THAT
STAT UP.

859
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:48,426
SO WE PROBABLY HAVE FOUR
MINUTES TO DO THIS.

860
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:52,163
I KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THESE TRIBE MATES HAVE LOOKED

861
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:52,730
FOR THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

862
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,132
I JUST GOT CAUGHT EARLY.

863
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,667
SO IM GOING FOR IT.

864
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,769
OF COURSE IM GOING TO GO FOR
IT.

865
00:38:58,803 --> 00:38:59,970

EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR AN
IDOL.

IM ONLY LOOKING FOR AN IDOL
BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS LOOKING.

873
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,493

876
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,569
THEY DONT COME UP EASY.

877
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,105

00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:54,158
AT THIS POINT IT FEELS LIKE ITS
A RACE TO THE IDOL.

881
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,361
EVERYBODY IS ALL WORKED UP ABOUT
THIS IDOL.

882
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:05,069
I THINK ITS FUNNY BECAUSE ITS
IN MY PANTS.

883
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,139
SO THIS BAD BOY RIGHT HERE MAKES
ME FEEL BULLET-PROOF.

884
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,441
I HAVE NEVER FELT BULLET-PROOF
BEFORE.

885
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,776
ITS A NICE FEELING.

886
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:17,548
THE SHORT OF THE STORY IS ME,
KARA AND NATALIA ARE ALL LOOKING

887
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,449
FOR IDOLS.

888
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:19,283
WERE LOOKING IN EVERYTHING.

889
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,286
I LOOK TO MY LEFT AND I SEE THIS
ROCK.

890
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,554
THIS ROCK JUST LOOKS COOL.

891
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,457
MAYBE THERE IS AN IDOL BURIED
UNDERNEATH IT.

892
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,794
I LOOK UP AND RIGHT THERE IN
FRONT OF ME IS PURPLE STRING

893
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:33,831
WRAPPED AROUND A ROCK.

894
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,366
HEY, GUYS, GUYS.

00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:47,278
IM LIKE, OH, MY GOD, I CANT

899
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,112
"CONGRATULATIONS.

900
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:52,116
YOU HAVE FOUND A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL."

901
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,418
FINDING THIS IDOL IS A GOLIATH
MOMENT FOR ME.

902
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,253
I SET MYSELF A GOAL AND I FOUND
IT.

903
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,389
I AM BECOMING THE PERSON I WANT
TO BE IN MY LIFE.

904
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:01,892
I FOUND AN IDOL WITH THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS IN THIS WHOLE

905
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:02,827
ENTIRE GAME RIGHT NOW.

906
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,462
IT CANNOT GET ANY BETTER.

907
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,797
WE FOUND IT.

908
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:14,038
YES!

909
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:21,045
I CANNOT GET OVER THIS.

910
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,013
FREAKIN AWESOME.

911
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:29,720
YES, YES.

912
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,797
I GOT AN OCTOPUS, A FREAKIN
OCTOPUS.

913
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,266
NO?

914
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,569
THATS CRAZY.

915
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,538
DAVY CROCKETT, KING OF THE WILD
FRONTIER.

916
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:50,574
WERE TAKING THIS SUMMER BACK
THE CAMP.

917
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,376
IM STILL COLD.

918
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,745
YOU GET ANYTHING, DAVIE?

919
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,548
I CAUGHT A FREAKIN OCTOPUS.

920
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,583
OH, MY.

921
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,252
AN OCTOPUS, DUDE.

922
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,987
LOOK AT IT.

923
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,624
CALAMARI FOR DINNER AND RICE.

924
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,292
HE CAUGHT AN OCTOPUS.

925
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:12,596
IVE ALWAYS BEEN SOMEONE WHO
DOESNT CONFORM TO SOCIETY.

926
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:19,537
IM ACTUALLY A BLURD, WHICH IS A
BLACK NERD.

927
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:24,508
IVE US A BEEN A FAN OF THE
ZOMBIE GENRE, CARTOONS,

928
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,476
NERD-TYPE THINGS.

929
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,678
DAVIE, SINCE YOU CAUGHT IT,
YOU WANT FIRST?

930
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,246
NO, ITS ALL YOU, BRO.

931
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,447
LOOK AT THIS.

932
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:35,252
I LOVE "SURVIVOR," SO TO BE
SITTING HERE ON AN ISLAND IN

933
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:39,890
FIJI, WAY TO GO.

934
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:46,897
IM STILL SLAPPING MYSELF IN MY
MIND, BECAUSE IS THIS REAL?

935
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,700
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE RAIN
JUST STOPPED.

936
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,937
IT JUST SUCKS WITH NO FIRE AND
NO SUN.

937
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,073
IM JUST GETTING THROUGH IT,
YOU KNOW.

938
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,374
THATS ALL RIGHT.

939
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,676
ITS HARD.

940
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,644
YEAH.

941
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:04,315
I FEEL PITIFUL THAT IM
CRYING ON DAY TWO.

942
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:08,752
ITS BECAUSE IN THOSE MOMENTS
WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE

943
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:13,223
NOWHERE TO TURN, I ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE THAT PERSON FOR OTHER

944
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,393
PEOPLE, THAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY
COULD GO TO, AND IT JUST SO

945
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,864
HAPPENED THAT THE PERSON I DID
THAT WITH WAS MY MOM.

946
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:26,503
MY MOM HAD A GUIDE IN HER LIFE,
AND THAT WHOLE RELATIONSHIP WAS

947
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:32,142
JUST REALLY NOT GOOD FOR HER,
VERBAL, MENTAL, VERY TOXIC.

948
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,777
IT WAS VERY TOUGH TO SEE THAT.

949
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:38,015
AND IT WAS LIKE I HAD TO BE THE
MOM IN SOME WAYS, AND HERIVAUX

950
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,884
THROUGH IT BECAUSE I NEVER
WANTED HER TO FEEL ALONE OR BY

951
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:44,121
HERSELF.

952
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:47,725
I WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP FOR
FIVE YEARS WHERE HE BEAT ME LIKE

953
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:48,025
EVERY DAY.

954
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:48,926
WOW.

955
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,527
I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL LIKE
EVERY MONTH.

956
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,862
IT WAS BAD.

957
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:55,766
YOUR MOM IS LUCKY, BECAUSE WHEN
I WAS IN THAT SITUATION, I

958
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,267
DIDNT HAVE ANYONE.

959
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,769
SO I STUCK WITH HIM.

960
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,640
IVE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH,
LIKE COMING TO AMERICA AT A

961
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:06,176
YOUNG AGE FROM VIETNAM AS
VIETNAMESE REFUGEES, I

962
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,111
EXPERIENCED POVERTY.

963
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,380
I HAD AN ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND WHEN
I WAS YOUNG.

964
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:15,152
MY WHOLE LIFE IS LIKE 28 YEARS
OF FIGHTING, AND AS AN M.M.A.

965
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:19,023
FIGHTER, I SPEAK TO A LOT OF
DOMESTIC ABUSE WOMEN, AND I DO

966
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,691
LIKE FREE SELF-DEFENSE SEMINARS.

967
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:24,495
SO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
SURE SHE TOOK AWAY FROM THE

968
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:25,996
CONVERSATION IS SHE SAVED HER
MOMS LIFE.

969
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,833
I DONT KNOW WHAT YOUR MOM
WENT THROUGH, BUT SHE WAS LUCKY

970
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:33,971
TO HAVE YOU IN HER LIFE.

971
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:38,042
EVERYBODY ELSE IS TALKING
ABOUT THEIR PARENTS DOMESTIC

972
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,243
ABUSE, AND EVERYBODY IS CRYING.

973
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:43,280
ITS NOT REALLY HOW I USUALLY
TALK TO PEOPLE.

974
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:49,620
IM JUST A GUY THAT LIKE WONT
OPEN UP.

975
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,990
WELL, I HAVE THIS STORY, I
REALLY DIDNT FEEL COMFORTABLE

976
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,224
SHARING IT.

977
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:56,627
ITS PERSONAL, AND ITS FOR ME
AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND

978
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,764
MY FAMILY, BUT WHEN EVERYBODY IN
MY TRIBE IS TALKING ABOUT THEIR

979
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:05,703
MOST TRAUMATIC EVENT, I FEEL
LIKE I CAN LET MY GUARD DOWN.

980
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,571
I WANTED TO TELL YOU ALL
SOMETHING.

981
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:12,643
I DONT KNOW, ITS JUST HARD FOR
ME TO OPEN UP, AND SO LIKE, YOU

982
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:17,414
KNOW, WHEN WE WERE SAYING OUR
STORIES, YOU KNOW, THERE IS

983
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:21,852
SOMETHING ABOUT ME THAT I JUST
DIDNT TALK ABOUT YET, AND

984
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,755
BASICALLY WHERE I COME FROM,
LIKE WE ALL HAVE SOMEBODY CLOSE

985
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:28,158
WHO IS LIKE, YOU KNOW, HAD DRUG
PROBLEMS, AND I WAS JUST IS

986
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:32,262
SCARED TO TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE
I DONT WANT MY MOTHER TO LOOK

987
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:36,967
BAD, YOU KNOW, BUT TO LOSE MY
MOM TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT, ITS

988
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,635
SO SAD TO ME.

989
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:48,712
I MEAN, SHE... I MISS HER SO
MUCH.

990
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:58,956
I MEAN, SHE... I MISS HER SO
MUCH.

991
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,458
I FEEL LIKE IVE BEEN KEEPING
THINGS FROM YOU ALL.

992
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,827
YOU COULD HAVE HELD THAT IN
UNTIL THE VERY END.

993
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,795
IM SORRY.

994
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:05,395
DONT BE SORRY.

995
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:05,863
DONT BE.

996
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,131
DONT BE SORRY.

997
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,333
SINCE I HAVE SHARED MY STORY,
IT REALLY FEELS LIKE THERE IS A

998
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,534
WEIGHT OFF ME.

999
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:14,171
I REALLY NEED THE TALK ABOUT MY
PERSONAL STRUGGLES, AS WELL.

1000
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,239
I DO.

1001
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,141
BECAUSE I NEVER HARDLY CRY
ANYMORE, AND I THINK ITS

1002
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,909
BECAUSE MY MOM ISNT HERE.

1003
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:24,748
BECAUSE SHES ALWAYS THE PERSON
I WOULD CALL, AND BEING ABLE TO

1004
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,317
OPEN UP TO MY TRIBE MATES, SHE
WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD OF ME FOR

1005
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,385
THAT.

1006
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:33,891
I THINK THE STORM HAS BROUGHT
GOOD THINGS FOR US.

1007
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:38,061
EVEN THOUGH WERE SUPER WET, IT
MADE US BOND.

1008
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,263
THATS TRUE.

1009
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,430
THATS TRUE.

1010
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,167
I THINK WHEN I OPENED MY HEARTED
TO THEM, IT REALLY MADE A

1011
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,434
DIFFERENCE.

1012
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,672
I THINK IT KIND OF FORMS A BOND,
AND IT WILL HELP ME GROW CLOSER

1013
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:52,709
TO ALL THESE PEOPLE, AND ALL OF
THEM I NEED AT THIS POINT.

1014
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:33,784
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1015
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:41,792
WELCOME TO "SURVIVOR."

1016
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,093

00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,604
IDOL.

1021
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,471
ITS PRETTY SIMPLE.

1022
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:55,806
IF YOU HAVE THIS, YOURE SAFE.

1023
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,475
IF YOU DONT, YOURE HEADING TO
TRIBAL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE

1024
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,142
VOTED OUT.

1025

LETS GET TO IT.

OBSTACLE TO A SAND PIT WHERE ONE

1028
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,387
TO DIG UNDER A LOG.

1029
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,157
THE FIRST THROUGH HAS THE
MACHETE.

1030
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,694
THEYLL USE IT TO CHOP A ROPE,
RELEASING YOUR LADDER.

1031
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:21,698
THE SECOND TRIBE IS PENALIZED
AND MUST UNTIE KNOTS TO RELEASE

1032
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,833
THEIR LADDER.

00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,969
YOULL THEN CONFRONT THE
"SURVIVOR" POLE VAULT, WHICH YOU

1036
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:38,582

00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:50,727
IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN THE GAME, FIRE IN THE FORM OF

1040
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,061
FLINT.

1041
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,729

1042
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,232

Jeff: WOW.

1056
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,504
THAT IS A BATTLE.

1057
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,073
PAT GOING AFTER IT.

1058
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:39,977
NOW CANT GO ANYWHERE UNTIL
EVERYBODY IS AT YOUR MAT.

1059
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,080
PAT WILL NOT LET JOHN GO.

1060
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,048
WOW.

1061
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,683

LETS GO, LETS GO.

1063
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,957
Matt: YOURE GOOD, GOLAITH.

1064
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,325
IT IS ALEX VERSUS CARL.

1065
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,963
ITS A SHOWDOWN RIGHT NOW
BETWEEN DAVID AND GOLAITH.

1066
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,398
TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES.

1067
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,266
CARL IS USING HIS FEET.

1068
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,038
ALEC IS DIGGING.

1069
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,906
ALEC GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.

1070
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,008
CAN HE GET THROUGH?

1071
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,075
ALEC IS THROUGH.

1072
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,343
HELL GET THE MACHETE.

1073
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:23,820
CARL IS STUCK.

1074
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,389
GO, GOLIATH.

1075
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,356
DAVID TILL WORKING.

1076
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,792
CARL TRYING TO GET UNDER THAT
POLE.

1077
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:29,893
GO, GOLIATH.

1078
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:30,727
NATALIA IS FIRST.

1079
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:31,595
SHES ACROSS.

1080
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:32,963
THATS HOW YOU DO IT.

1081
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,499
TEAMWORK.

1082
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,834
CARL IS THROUGH.

1083
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,403
AND EXHAUSTED.

1084
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:42,572
CARL HAS NOW GOT TO UNTIE THE
KNOTS.

1085
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:47,310
THE DAVID TRIBE QUICKLY FALLING
BEHIND EARLY IN THIS CHALLENGE.

1086
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,112
THE GOLIATH TRIBE WORKING
TOGETHER.

1087
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,814
ALEC HELPING EVERYBODY.

1088
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:54,518
PULL IT, PULL IT, TO THE
RIGHT.

1089
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,919
Jeff: THERE YOU GO, GO,
DAVID.

1090
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,921
WE ARE STILL IN THIS!

1091
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:01,091
Jeff: THE GOLIATHS ARE ALL

1092
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:01,792
GO, GOLIATHS.

1093
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,361
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1094
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,562
Jeff: THERE GOES PAT.

1095
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:06,696
HES FIRST ACROSS.

1096
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,831
TAKE IT EASY.

1097
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:13,870
TAKE IT EASY.

1098
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,705
BI IS ACROSS NOW.

1099
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,107
GOLIATH HAS MASSIVE HEAD START.

1100
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,509
THE GOLIATHS ARE ALREADY MOVING
PUZZLE PIECES.

1101
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,645
11.

1102
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,313
PUSH THIS ONE RIGHT HERE.

1103
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:28,485
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE IT.

1104
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,821
Jeff: HERE COMES DAVIE, THE
LAST DAVID.

1105
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,022
YOURE GOOD.

1106
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:32,422
GO.

1107
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,424
GO, GO, GO!

1108
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,760
CARL TAKES A BIG FALL.

1109
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,529
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH THE RINGER
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

1110
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,832
CHRISTIAN IS THE CALLER FOR THE
DAVIDS.

1111
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:46,603
IT IS A REMATCH FROM THE EARLIER
SHOWDOWN, CHRISTIAN VERSUS

1112
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:47,971
ALISON.

1113
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:50,874
YOU ARE SOLVING THIS PUZZLE.

1114
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,776
ONE THROUGH 25.

1115
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,277
ROW TWO, ROW TWO.

1116
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:58,882
Jeff: NUMBERS GO HORIZONLY
LEFT TO RIGHT, ONE THROUGH 25.

1117
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:02,018
THIS IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO
TRIBE COMMUNICATION.

1118
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,654
PUSH ROW TWO.

1119
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,323
Jeff: HERE COMES THE RAIN
AGAIN.

1120
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,125
17 COMES OUT ANYWAY.

1121
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,727
Jeff: BOTH TRIBES
APPROACHING THIS THE SAME WAY.

1122
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,331
THE ONE IS GOING TO GO THERE.

1123
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:17,467
THEYRE GOING VERTICALLY EVEN
THOUGH THE PUZZLE IS HORIZON, SO

1124
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:21,805
ITS NOT GOING THE LOOK RIGHT
UNTIL YOU HAVE EVERY ROW

1125
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:22,739
FINISHED.

1126
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:26,042
THE GOLIATHS HAVE THEIR FIRST
VERTICAL ROW.

1127
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,811
THE DAVIDS HAVE THEIR LAST
VERTICAL ROW.

1128
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,013
THE DAVIDS HAVE CAUGHT UP IN
THIS CHALLENGE NOW.

1129
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,248
WE ARE NECK AND NECK.

1130
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,183
EXCELLENT.

1131
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,285
CYCLE IT ONE MORE TIME UNTIL I
GET THE 24.

1132
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,687
Jeff: GREAT COMMUNICATION
BY THE DAVID TRIBE.

1133
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,890
NOBODY ARGUING.

1134
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,992
PULL IT, PULL IT.

1135
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:42,993
ONE IS DONE.

1136
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:47,631
Matt: EVERYBODY YELLING ON
THE GOLIATH TRIBE.

1137
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:51,067
THE GOLIATH TRIBE FINISHES A
SECOND ROW.

1138
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,069
GOLIATH HAVING SUCCESS DESPITE
YELLING AT EACH OTHER.

1139
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,671
PUT THAT IN ROW FOUR.

1140
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,039
WE ARE DONE THERE.

1141
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:59,075
Jeff: DAVIDS NOW HAVE THEIR
SECOND ROW COMPLETE AND WE ARE

1142
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:02,112
BACK TIED AGAIN, JUST WENDELL
THE GOLIATHS PULL AHEAD, THE

1143
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:05,315
DAVIDS ARE RIGHT ON THEIR HEELS,
AS EXPECTED.

1144
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,816
ITS FOUR, ITS FOUR!

1145
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,620
Jeff: WILL IT BE THE
GOLIATHS, OR WILL IT BE THE

1146
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:11,354
DAVIDS?

1147
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,290
THE GHIETS HAVE THEIR FOURTH
ROW.

1148
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,157
ONE AND ONE?

1149
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,026
ONE AND ONE.

1150
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:21,765
Jeff: THE DAVIDS NOW HAVE
THEIR FOURTH ROW.

1151
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:30,507
THIS IS IT!

1152
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:36,313
[ALL YELLING]
THE GOLIATHS THINK THEY HAVE IT.

1153
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:42,285
THE GOLIATHS PULL OUT THE FIRST
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, SENDING THE

1154
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,657
DAVID TRIBE TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1162
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:11,748

1170
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,236
ITS A SICKENING FEELING
FIRST AND FOREMOST.

1171
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:38,575
THE RAIN IS COMPLETE MORALE
BUMMER, BUT ITS BROUGHT US

00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,443

1173

AND ITS BROUGHT OUR HEARTS

OUR HEART, BUT WERE GOING TO

1175
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:49,119

00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:54,858

SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

1184
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,496
ITS TOUGH TO LOSE.

1185
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,197
NOW WE HAVE TO VOTE SOMEONE OUT.

1186
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,000
AND I DONT TRUST NICK.

1187
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:08,438
I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM PERFORM IN
THE GROUP AND IN THE CAMP, AND

1188
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,739
ITS NOT ONLY ME.

1189
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,776
THATS THE CONSENSUS OF THE
TRIBE.

1190
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,223
I CANT SEE.

1191
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:00,557
ITS OKAY.

1192
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,091
ITS OKAY.

1193
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,792
SLOW, DEEP BREATHS.

1194
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,428
YOULL BE OKAY.

00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,967
NOT YET, NOT YET.

1197
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,237
OVER THIS SIDE.

1198
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,006
CAN YOU TAKEVE THE HEAD AND
NECK.

1199
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,479
DO YOU MIND BRINGING THE LINE
IN.

00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:28,385
WHEREABOUTS IS YOUR PAIN AT

1201
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,587

FOCUS ON THAT.

1207
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,163
I CANT FOCUS.

1208
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,030
ITS OKAY.

1209
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,332
YOURE DOING A GOOD JOB.

1210
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:44,467
YOURE DOING A GOOD JOB.

1211
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:48,571
WENDELL WE LEAVE THE
CHALLENGE, WE ARE ON A BOAT.

1212
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:53,676
THE SEAS ARE REALLY ROUGH, AND
THE BOAT SLAMS DOWN ON ONE OF

1213
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:59,449
THE WAVES, AND WE HEAR A CRACK,
AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT PAT HAD

1214
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:02,552
JUST HURT HIS BACK, MAYBE
TWEAKED IT A BIT, BUT WE DONT

1215
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,789
FOE WHATS HAPPENING, AND WERE
WATCHING, WERE HOPING FOR THE

1216
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:09,125
BEST
 PAT YOULL FEEL A LITTLE COLD

1217
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,427
SENSATION GOING UP YOUR ARM.

1218
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,896
OKAY, BUDDY.

1219
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:13,763
IM SCARED.

1220
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:14,297
DONT WORRY.

1221
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,465
YOU JUST FOCUS ON ME.

1222
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,100
TAKE NICE, DEEP BREATHS.

1223
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:22,872
AND THEN JEFF ARRIVED, AND WE
ALL GROANED, BECAUSE IT MEANS

1224
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:25,241
SOMETHING REALLY BAD HAS
HAPPENED.

1225
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,379
THEY WERE ON A BOAT
TRANSPORTING BACK TO THEIR CAMP,

1226
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,613
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

1227
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:34,451
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERES BEEN
AN IMPACT ON THE BOAT WHICH HAS

1228
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,853
HIT PAT PRETTY HARD ON HIS BACK,
CAUSING HIM A LOT OF PAIN.

1229
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,455
ARE YOU STILL WITH US, PAT?

1230
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:44,994
PAT, CAN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES THE
PAIN IS THE MAIN PROBLEM.

1231
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:47,864
Jeff: JOE, THIS IS REALLY
UNUSUAL, EVEN THOUGH A BET RIDE

1232
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:52,602
BACK TO CAMP IS VERY NORMAL,
WEVE NEVER HAD ANYBODY BEING

1233
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,337
INJURED BEING TRANSPORTED.

1234
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:58,741
WHATS THE CONCERN?

1235
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,377
BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT TO HIS
BACK AND THE AMOUNT OF PAIN HES

1236
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:04,013
NEW YORK WE ARE WORRIED THAT HE
COULD HAVE DONE SOME KIND OF

1237
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,849
FRACTURE TO HIS BACK.

1238
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:10,687
Jeff: PAT, CAN YOU HEAR ME,
ITS JEFF?

1239
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,788
THIS IS SEVERE.

1240
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,257
IS THIS A QUESTION RIGHT NOW OF
WHETHER HE CONTINUES?

1241
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,293
YEAH, I THINK IT MIGHT BE.

1242
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:22,065
YOU OKAY.

1243
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,000
YOU CANT TAKE ME.

1244
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:24,567
I CANT LEAVE.

1245
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:26,603
I CANT LEAVE.

1246
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:36,212
BE STRONG.

1247
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,481
WERE HERE FOR YOU, PAT.

1248
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:43,753
I CANT.

1249
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,989
JOE, IS THERE ANY WAY FOR HIM
TO CONTINUE, OR DO YOU NEED TO

1250
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,223
GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL?

1251
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,426
HES A TOUGH GUY, SOMEONE AS
TOUGH AS PAT IN THIS MUCH PAIN

1252
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,996
DOES MAKE ME CONCERNED THAT WE
DO NEED TO RULE OUT ANY SERIOUS

1253
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,298
DAMAGE, WHICH WE CANT DO ON THE
BEACH.

1254
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,000
Jeff: SO YOURE PULLING HIM
FROM THE GAME?

1255
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,201
I DONT THINK WE HAVE ANY
CHOICE.

1256
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,204
WE TO GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL TO
MAKE SURE THERES NO SERIOUS

1257
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,473
DAMAGE.

1258
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:07,610
I JUST CANT.

1259
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:10,813
Jeff: BROTHER, IM AFRAID
THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE.

1260
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,582
WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU,
PAT.

1261
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:16,319
THATS THE NUMBER-ONE JOB OF OUR
MEDICAL TEAM IS TO TAKE CARE OF

1262
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,820
YOU.

1263
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,789
LETS BRING IN THE HELICOPTER,
GUYS.

1264
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:20,823
LETS BRING IT IN.

1265
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:21,991
THEYRE TAKING HIM OUT.

1266
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,059
OH, MY GOSH.

1267
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:27,163
SERIOUSLY, NOTHING CAN GO OUR
WAY, LIKE NOTHING.

1268
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:37,106
I FEEL SO BAD FOR HIM.

1269
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,076
Jeff: YOU JUST SAID AT THE
END OF THE CHALLENGE THAT THE

1270
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:42,445
DAVID TRIBE WAS GOING THE LOSE
AN ARTERY BUT THE HEART WAS

1271
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,982
GOING TO GO ON, YOU CLEARLY
DIDNT KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO BE

1272
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:46,649
THE ARTERY.

1273
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,217
I DONT WANT TO QUIT.

1274
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,653
Jeff: YOU ARE NOT QUITTING.

1275
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:54,524
DR. JOE IS PULLING YOU FROM THE
GAME FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.

1276
00:59:54,557 --> 01:00:04,968
THERE IS NOBODY THATS GOING TO
QUESTION YOUR HEART.

1277
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:10,073
COME ON IN, GUYS.

1278
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,241
YOURE A BEAST.

1279
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,878
IT WAS REALLY HARD TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO HIM.

1280
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,880
HE WAS FIGHTING TO STAY IN.

1281
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,516
AND THERE WAS TEARS ROLLING DOWN
HIS FACE.

1282
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,818
WE LOVE YOU, PAT.

1283
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,320
WE LOVE YOU, PAT.

1284
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:25,121
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

1285
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,789
WE GOT TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

1286
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:27,824
BE STRONG.

1287
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:31,294
ONE, TWO, THREE... LIFT!

1288
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:34,864
I HOPE HE KNOWS HOW MUCH WE
LOVE HIM, AND I HOPE THAT HES

1289
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:37,266
STILL GRATEFUL FOR THIS
EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE WERE

1290
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,635
GRATEFUL FOR HIM.

1291
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:39,402
OKAY.

1292
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:40,837
WE NEED TO GO UP, FURTHER UP.

1293
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:43,640
WE LOVE YOU, PAT!

1294
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,775
WE LOVE YOU, PAT!

1295
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,943
STAY STRONG.

1296
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,980
AS PAT LEFT, I FELT A SENSE
OF GUILT IN A WAY, BECAUSE I

1297
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,749
THINK I REALLY MISJUDGED HIM.

1298
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:56,919
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE
THIS BOSSY JERK GUY FROM NEW

1299
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:57,620
YORK.

1300
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,789
I COULDNT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG.

1301
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,091
HE ORGANIZED HOW TO BUILD THE
SHELTER.

1302
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,826
HE WAS THE LEADER FROM DAY ONE.

1303
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,962
HE WAS THE CENTER OF CAMP.

1304
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:10,433
AND ITS JUST A HUGE LOSS.

1305
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:11,534
Jeff: MAN.

1306
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,837
EXPECTED THE UNEXPECTED EVERY
DAY OUT HERE.

1307
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,372
I CAN SEE THE EMOTION.

1308
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:17,273
HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING?

1309
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:20,109
TO LOSE HIM SO EARLY, ITS
REALLY HARD.

1310
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,846
YOU GOT TO SIT BACK AND THINK,
IS ANYTHING GOING TO GO OUR WAY,

1311
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,417
BECAUSE WE JUST LOST ONE OF OUR
STRONGEST PLAYERS.

1312
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,453
Jeff: OF ALL THE TRIBES FOR
THIS TO HAPPEN TO, ITS THE

1313
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:31,454
DAVID TRIBE.

1314
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:35,191
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY THROWN AN
OBSTACLE EVERY DAY.

1315
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:38,528
NONE OF US WOULD HAVE
EXPECTED THIS, AND IT FITS WHAT

1316
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,765
WEVE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT SO
PERFECTLY IN THE WORST WAY.

1317
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:47,570
BUT I FEEL LIKE PAT WOULD WANT
TO SEE US SUCCEED AND STICK

1318
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:49,906
TOGETHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

1319
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:54,477
Jeff: WELL, IF THERE IS A
SILVER LINING, YOU LOST A

1320
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,779
CHALLENGE, YOU LOST A TRIBE
MEMBER, YOU WONT LOSE ANOTHER

1321
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:57,647
ONE.

1322
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,015
THERE WILL BE NO TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.

1323
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,183
THANK YOU, JEFF.

1324
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,984
Jeff: ONE LAST BIT OF GOOD
NEWS, EVEN THOUGH YOURE NOT

1325
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,787
GOING TO TRIBAL, THERE WILL BE A
FLINT WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT

1326
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:05,988
CAMP.

1327
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:09,125
HOPEFULLY THE RAIN WILL BRECK
AND YOU GUY CAN GET TO WORK ON

1328
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:09,592
STARTING FIRE.

1329
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,827
ALL RIGHT.

1330
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,931
THREE DAYS IN, DOWN ONE TRIBE
MEMBER, BUT WE ARE EARLY IN THIS

1331
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:15,498
GAME.

1332
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,733
THE FIGHT AINT OVER.

1333
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,000
WERE GOING TO KEEP BRINGING IT.

1334
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,102
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1335
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,936
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1336
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:20,670
GET TO CAMP.

1337
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:22,538
THE GAME CONTINUES ON.

1338
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:27,009
TODAY WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE
MOST DRAINING DAYS OF MY LIFE.

1339
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,945
THIS HAS BEEN CRAZY.

1340
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:32,982
AND ITS TESTING YOU RIGHT OUT
THE GATE, ONE DISASTER AFTER THE

1341
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:34,250
NEXT.

1342
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:36,586
THIS IS TYPICAL OF WHAT A DAVID
HAS TO GO THROUGH TO ACCOMPLISH

1343
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:37,887
ANYTHING IN LIFE.

1344
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,957
BUT THIS AINT MY FIRST TIME
IVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, YOU

1345
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,926
KNOW, AND SO I THINK THAT IS
SOMETHING THAT THE DAVIDS HAVE

1346
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,994
GOING FOR US.

1347
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:51,634
WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING.

1348
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,306
Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1349
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:05,782
Matt: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THERES NEW WAR.

1350
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:08,317
IM GOING TO DROP A LITTLE
NATALIE NAPALM BEFORE ITS OVER.

1351
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:09,118
SHES CRAZY.

1352
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,319
SOME PEOPLE SAY ITS
AGGRESSIVE.

1353
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:10,987
OH, WELL.

1354
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,488
Jeff: A NEW TARGET.

1355
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,857
THEYRE THROWING YOUR NAME
OUT.

1356
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:15,925
EXCUSE ME?

1357
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,227
AND A NEW MAN IN CHARGE.

1358
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:21,364
AFTER HYPER PERSON LIKE ME IS
THE PERSON TO HANDLE IT ALL.

1359
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:25,168
TO BE OUT OF THE GAME NOT BY
VOTE BUT BY PURE ACCIDENT IS GUT

1360
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:32,542
WRENCHING, BUT ULTIMATELY I WILL
PICK MYSELF UP AND GET BACK ON

1361
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:33,509
MY HORSE.

1362
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,912
AS A DAVID, ITS WHAT IVE DONE
FOR 41 YEARS.

1363
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,948
ITS THE STORY OF MY LIFE.
