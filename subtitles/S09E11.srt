Survivors, ready?

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,297
Go!

5
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,841
The tribe competed as two

6
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,050
randomly split teams of four.

7
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,052
Chris, Chad and Ami dragged

8
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,555
Eliza across the finish line

9
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,305
first.

10
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,140
>> Yeah!

11
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,517
>> PROBST: The four embarked on

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,852
a cultural experience of a

13
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,019
lifetime...

14
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,230
(men singing)

15
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,733
...and were treated to an array

16
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,150
of Vanuatu customs.

17
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,153
(Chad gags, coughs)

18
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,195
Back at camp, the others endured

19
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,239
a terrible storm.

20
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,073
>> It's going to be a miracle

21
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,491
if we can keep our fire.

22
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,701
I've never been in a worse

23
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,036
situation than this.

>> PROBST: The next morning,

25
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,081
Scout proposed a plan to first

26
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,293
oust Eliza and then Ami.

27
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,753
When the others returned from

28
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,755
the reward, Ami suspected

29
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,256
something was up.

30
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,259
>> I had really weird feelings.

00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,386
>> PROBST: At the immunity

32
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,305
challenge, Chad and Twila hung

33
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,598
in the longest.

34
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,432
And Chad is slipping.

35
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,516
>> Go down, Chad, go

36
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,559
down.

>> PROBST: Back at camp, Ami

40
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,609
swayed Leann and Julie to vote

41
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,235
out Chad instead of Eliza...

42
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:09,486
>> Scout?

43
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,779
>> Yeah?

44
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,362
>> They're not going to

45
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,113
vote for Eliza.

49
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,284
nothing yet.

50
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:16,701
I'm still thinking.

51
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,204
I'm aggravated.

52
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,622
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

53
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,247
Scout admitted to scheming with

54
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,207
the guys.

55
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,083
>> We have talked quite a

56
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,794
bit about different strategies

57
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,086
to get to the end of the game.

58
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,545
>> It makes me nervous

59
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,547
that two women might be voting

60
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,632
with the two men.

62
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,760
received two votes, the women's

alliance held strong, and Chad

64
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:36,554
was voted out of the tribe...

65
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,265
Chad, the tribe has spoken.

66
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,350
...leaving Chris as the last man

67
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,811
standing.

68
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,353
Seven are left.

69
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:52,278
Who will be voted out tonight?

>> I really thought I was

74
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,326
going home, though.

75
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,619
Tribal Council sucks.

76
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,453
I hate it.

77
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,287
I always think I'm going home.

78
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,330
It's kind of funny, but everyone

79
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,582
who conspires against me ends up

80
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,584
off and I'm still here.

>> Yeah.

82
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,677
Scout and Twila come to me and

83
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,971
Chad wanting to form an alliance

84
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,056
with us.

85
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:43,681
And Scout thought she could get

86
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:48,227
you and Leann to vote for Eliza.

87
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,688
And when Eliza was gone, then

88
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,274
Scout, Twila, me and Chad would

89
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,943
have the numbers on you, Ami and

90
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,778
Leann, and we'd get rid of Ami

91
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,821
first.

92
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,447
Swear to God on my family's

lives.

94
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,285
As soon as I got back to camp, I

95
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,371
narc'd out Scout and Twila, and

96
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:06,996
I let them know that they had

97
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,790
conspired with me and Chad for

98
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,916
an alliance.

99
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,126
I just, you know, I just mixed

100
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,252
things up as soon as we got

101
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,087
back.

102
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,587
It's going to be a mess.

103
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,507
>> Oh, boy.

104
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,758
This kind of changes everything

105
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,259
in my head for the moment.

106
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:20,927
>> Mm-hmm.

107
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,220
It's hard to choose what to

108
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,805
believe because it would do

109
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,099
Chris a lot of good to get us

110
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,350
mad at Twila and Scout.

111
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,519
It would make him last longer in

112
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,646
the game.

113
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,078
>> I'm actually very surprised

114
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,496
that things happened the way

115
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,455
they did last night.

116
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,415
So I told Twila about it.

117
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,500
I heard some things that I'm not

118
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,710
very comfortable with, and we

119
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,170
need to talk about it.

120
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,303
>> Paranoia sets in on a

121
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,304
lot of us.

122
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,389
And I think it needs to quit.

123
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:06,889
>> I have to tell you,

124
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,473
Twila, you're striking me as a

125
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,017
panic player right now.

126
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,225
>> Why?

127
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:09,726
>> It makes me feel like

128
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,645
you're going to jump ship.

129
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,775
>> She just completely

130
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,610
confirmed the story, but she

131
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,612
told me it was all Scout's idea.

132
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,697
Man, I just didn't think it

133
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,823
would happen this soon.

134
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,991
I thought we'd at least wait

135
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,159
until the guys were gone before

136
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,535
the girls started going crazy on

137
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,619
each other.

138
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,204
But, oh, it's happening.

139
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,289
If they were going to go with

140
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,081
that plan, they should have

141
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:32,707
stuck with it, 'cause now,

142
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,751
they're screwed.

143
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,061
>> PROBST: And then there were

144
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:53,519
seven.

145
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,562
All right.

146
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,647
For today's challenge, we're

147
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,316
going to test how much you

148
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,777
recall from the past 28 days.

149
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,861
I'm going to ask you five

150
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,988
questions about past challenges.

151
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:04,947
Each time you get an answer

152
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,573
right, you score a point.

153
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,533
At the end of five questions,

154
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,701
the person with the most points

155
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,869
wins the reward.

156
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,661
Want to know what you're playing

157
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,287
for?

158
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,038
>> Yes.

159
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,122
>> Sure do.

160
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:13,831
>> PROBST: It's no big secret,

161
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,750
after 28 days, the one thing you

162
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,502
miss more than food...

163
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:17,794
>> Oh, no.

164
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,087
>> No.

165
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,837
>> PROBST: Is love.

166
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:20,797
>> Oh, no.

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,631
>> PROBST: So here's what we've

168
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,465
set up.

169
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,424
We brought in a satellite.

170
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,676
We have a computer hooked up to

171
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,803
the Internet.

172
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,887
The winner's going to get a

173
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,472
one-hour real-time e-mail

174
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,141
back-and-forth chat.

175
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,684
You can type something, they can

176
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,852
type back to you.

177
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,187
So this is a chance to get

178
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,813
caught up with what's going on

179
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,357
back home, give a little love

180
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,025
and certainly get a whole lot of

181
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,651
love that you need to make it

182
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,153
through the last 11 days.

183
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,113
Worth playing for?

184
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:45,446
>> ALL: Yeah.

185
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,240
>> PROBST: I want to whet your

186
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,616
appetite and give everybody a

one-minute e-mail hello.

188
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,411
>> Oh, thank God.

189
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,204
Thank you, Jeff.

190

00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,499
(laughs)

194
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:01,337
Oh, my God...

195
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,380
>> PROBST: Twila, you're already

196
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,381
crying.

197
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:03,631
>> Yep.

198
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,299

00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,467
you first. Sit on down.

200
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,385
>> Can somebody else type

201
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:07,885
for me?

202
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:08,511
I don't know how to type.

203
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,303
>> PROBST: You don't?

204
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:09,512

205
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,555

206
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,389
computers much?

207
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,223
>> No.

208
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,641

209
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:18,146
You get a... aw...

210
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,314
It's a darn good thing that

211
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,900
we have a camera so you can

212
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,195
hear and see your loved ones.

213
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,196
>> Oh, my God.

214
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,072
>> PROBST: Hold on here, let's

215
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:28,906

216
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,532
here, your son.

217
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,577
>> Hi. Hi, Mom, how are you?

218
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,494
>> I was being tough

219
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,163
till I seen you.

220
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,498
>> Oh, you're still tough.

221
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,332
We love you.

222
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:38,708
We miss you a ton.

223
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,085
>> I love you too, buddy.

224
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:41,544
I miss you so much.

225
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,212
>> PROBST: All right, Twila, you

00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:43,921
gotta say your good-byes.

227
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:44,547
>> I gotta say good-bye,

228
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:44,714
buddy.

229
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,382
You know I ain't very good at

230
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:46,883
this dumb stuff, but hope

231
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,719
I get to talk to you later.

232
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,220
>> Do good for me.

233
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:51,929
>> All right, babe.

234
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:52,597

Be nice to my Lizie out

268
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,815

276
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,368
What's up?!

277
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,285
Can you believe this?

278
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,203
>> What's going on?

279
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:57,745
>> Don't be so relaxed.

280
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,998
Dude... dude!

281
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,625

get your partner up here.

293
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,594
What's her name?

294
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,637
>> Annie.

295
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,847
>> PROBST: There she is.

296
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,807

Hi... hi, honey.

I love you so much.

299
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,607
>> Oh.

300
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,693

301
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,026
all the time.

302
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,569
You know they're there.

307
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:36,826

316
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,751
>> I know, God.

317
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,836
It seems like forever.

318
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,462
I miss you a lot.

319
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,631

I love you so much, babe.

00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:55,845
I want to go do the best

324
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,096
I can.

325
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,139

326
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:58,681
to me, so do well.

327
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,850

Who do you want to talk to most?

335
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,695
Would be that be your woman?

336
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,113
Let's see if we can get her up

337
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,489
here.

338
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,490
>> Hi.

339
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:16,866

345
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,751
from you, too, baby.

346
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,627

349
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,215
So what kind of plans have

350
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,300
you made for Cancun?

351
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,551
They all already know.

352
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,428
>> Yes, we're gonna get married.

353
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,555

359
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,688
(warm laughter)

360
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,899
>> PROBST: All right.

361
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,733
Shall we do the challenge?

362
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,650

364
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,448
Take a seat on the bench.

365
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,033
Anywhere is fine.

366
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,659
At stake, a one-hour chat with

367
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,577
your loved one.

368
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,161
Here's how it's going to work.

00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,954
I'm gonna ask you five questions

370

371
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,832
At the end of five questions,

00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,833
the person with the most points

373
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,378

376
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,046

All right.

382

The correct answer is Rory,

384
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,105
and everybody has it right.

385
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:29,939
Everybody's on the board.

386
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,732
Next question: In the "Great

387
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,360
Escape" challenge, who was the

388
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:34,944
first man to begin assembling

389
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,905

390
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,121
Reveal.

00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,872
The correct answer was Chad.

Everybody got it right.

393
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:48,916
We're all tied at two.

394
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,336
Next question: In the second

395
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,754
immunity challenge, where tribes

396
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,506
paired up to collect puzzle

397
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,633
pieces while blindfolded, who

398
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,552
sat out?

399
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,137
Who did not participate in that

400
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,889
challenge?

401
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,351
Everybody reveal.

402
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,522
The correct answer was... Dolly.

403
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,273

00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,400
Ami got it right.

406
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,317
Julie got it right.

407
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:15,776
Eliza got it right.

408
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,820
Here's where we stand: Eliza,

409
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,406
Julie, Leann, Scout, and Ami at

410
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:20,906

411
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,784
Twila and Chris at two.

412
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,910
Next question: In the fourth

413
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,329
immunity challenge, there were

414
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,914
four different symbols used on

415
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,791
the colored tiles.

416
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,960
Each correct symbol you identify

417
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,005
is worth one point.

418
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,719
Everybody reveal.

419
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,887
The four symbols were the

420
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,097
volcano, the pig head, the

421
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,599
coconut tree or the palm tree,

422
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,766
and a skull.

423
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,643
Chris, pig head is right.

424
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,519
You have one.

425
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,271
Scout, volcano is right, coconut

426
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,814
tree is right, pig is right.

427
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,649
Leann has volcano, pig and palm

428
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,109
tree.

429
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,235
All three are correct.

430
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,528
Ami has volcano, skull, and palm

431
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,238
tree.

432
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,283
Julie: pig, volcano and skull.

433
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,743
You score three.

434
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,368
Eliza has volcano, palm tree and

435
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,953
pig.

436
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,413
You score three.

437
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:09,914
>> I hate to see that.

438
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,916
>> PROBST: Twila: fish, turtle,

439
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,249
snail and hog.

440
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,293
I'll give you one for the pig.

441
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,920
>> Thank you.

442
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,838
>> PROBST: Here's where we

443
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,924
stand: Chris and Twila at three.

444
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,592
Everybody else tied at six.

445
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,969
Final question: In the first

446
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,763
reward challenge, which survivor

447
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:34,980
fell into the water the most?

448
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,982
Everybody reveal.

449
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,901
The correct answer was John K.

00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,194
Chris got it right.

451
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,487
Julie got it right.

452
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,863
Eliza got it right and Twila got

453
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,864
it right.

454
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,658
Julie and Eliza tied at seven

455
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,242
will now go into a tie-breaker

456
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,536
for just those two.

457
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,038
Julie and Ami, switch seats.

458
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,957
At stake, a visit with your

459
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,083
loved one.

460
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,918
In the third reward challenge,

461
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,046
the memory game, name the

462
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,714
matching pairs of items gathered

463
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,048
by the tribes.

464
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,008
The person who gets the most

465
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:07,930
wins.

466
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,265
These are the items you guys

467
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,560
gathered in the memory game.

468
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,645
Julie has an absolutely blank

469
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,022
look on her face.

470
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:22,945
Eliza writing like crazy.

471
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,533
Four, three, two, one.

472
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,993
Reveal.

473
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,953
Julie has absolutely nothing

474
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,037
written down.

475
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,163
Which means if Eliza has even

476
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,999
just one right, she wins.

477
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,126
First answer is grapefruit.

478
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:37,585
"Grapefruit" is right.

479
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,503
You win reward.

480
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,296
>> Yes!

481
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,046
>> PROBST: Nice job.

482
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,964
>> Oh, my God.

483
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,007
>> PROBST: Eliza, ready to go

484
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,133
have a little chat with your

485
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:44,758
mom?

486
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,426
>> Yes.

487
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,343
>> PROBST: Or would you rather

488
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,219
your mom came out here and

489
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:47,970
chatted with you?

490
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,013
>> No! Are you kidding!

491
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:49,972
>> PROBST: Come on out, Susan.

492
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:54,351
(both shrieking)

493
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,269
>> Oh, my God!

494
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,270
Oh, my God!

495
00:14:56,353 --> 00:15:01,025
Oh, my God!

496
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,318
I can't believe you're here!

497
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:02,776
I can't believe this!

498
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,028
>> You look so beautiful.

499
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,614
>> Oh, my God!

500
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,532
>> You did it!

501
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,700
>> PROBST: Okay, Susan, here's

502
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,161
the twist.

503
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,039
It's not a one-hour chat.

504
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,498
It's an overnight chat.

505
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,917
Go over and have a seat with

506
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,545
Eliza and get to know everybody.

507
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,255
So you probably figured out

508
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:23,964
everybody has been here.

509
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,842
We've created a little studio so

510
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,052
you could talk to them.

511
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,928
There's a winner and a bunch of

512
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,472
losers, but because I saw how

513
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,265
much it meant to you guys in

514
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,308
there, you get one little

515
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,602
good-bye.

516
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,604
So Twila, here's your son James.

517
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,815
>> Oh, my God.

518
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,816
My fella!

519
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,447
>> Mom!

520
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,198
>> I miss you so much, so

521
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,158
much, so much, so much.

522
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,201
>> PROBST: Twila, get a good

523
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:52,534
last hug in.

524
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,244
>> I miss you so much.

525
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,245
>> I love you.

526
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,246
>> I love you.

527
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:56,955
>> Bye.

528
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,706
>> Bye.

529
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,792
>> PROBST: James, you can have a

530
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,959
spot right here.

531
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,670
All right, Leann, get over here.

532
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,296
Let's get Teri out here.

533
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,257
Come on, Teri.

534
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,686
>> A couple weeks, okay?

535
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,186
I love you.

536
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,688
>> You look awesome.

537
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,063
I love you, too.

538
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,313
Okay, bye.

539
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,482
>> PROBST: Scout, come on over

540
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,525
here.

541
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,902
See if we can rustle up Annie.

542
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:31,198
(Annie shrieking)

543
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,366
>> Oh, my God.

544
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,034
>> I missed you so much.

545
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,744
Still do.

546
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,203
You look great.

547
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:40,124
Have fun.

548
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,041
>> PROBST: Julie, let's bring

549
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,292
out Justin.

550
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:49,091
(Julie shrieking, laughing)

551
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,928
>> My pants are up.

552
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:53,303
Come here, buddy!

553
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,099
I want to eat you up.

554
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,351
>> PROBST: All right, Ami.

555
00:16:59,435 --> 00:16:59,643
Come on up.

556
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,687
See if Crissy is back there.

557
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,229
Come on out, Crissy.

558
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:07,276
>> Oh, my God.

559
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,697
>> Hi, baby.

560
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,076
It's so good to hug you again.

561
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,202
>> How about you and I go

562
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,078
over there?

563
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,164
>> PROBST: Chris, come on out

564
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,792
here.

565
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,837
Come on, Laurie.

566
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:35,471
>> Okay.

567
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,308
Love you, too.

568
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,392
>> PROBST: All right, everybody.

569
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,477
I hate to break this party up.

570
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,853
Your boat has arrived.

571
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,937
You're heading back to the

572
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,354
States.

573
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,815
Say good-bye.

574
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,901
>> Okay, babe.

575
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,069
Okay. Bye.

576
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,987
>> PROBST: All right.

577
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,530
With that, you are going to get

578
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,782
to camp for the night.

579
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,365
They'll take you back and show

580
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,992
you what life on<i> Survivor</i> is

581
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,826
like.

582
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,744
All right, guys, get your stuff,

583
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,745
head back to camp.

584
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,789
Have a good night.

585
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,684
>> I want to hear about

586
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,143
the outside world.

587
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:23,435
>> Me, too.

588
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,231
>> I'm so glad you're here.

589
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,273
I'm so glad.

590
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,901
Oh, I couldn't be more excited

591
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,777
to be able to share this

592
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,694
experience with my mom.

593
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,654
I want to share everything with

594
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:33,862
my mom.

595
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,823
My mom is my best friend in the

596
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,448
entire world and I could not be

597
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,282
more excited that she's here

598
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,076
with us.

599
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:39,701
Oh, Mom, we have leftover trail

600
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,747
mix.

601
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,790
It's just fried coconuts and

602
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,290
plantains.

603
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,083
>> Really?

604
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,084
>> If you want to try.

605
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,709
>> Is it safe for me to get it?

606
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,710
>> Oh, yeah.

607
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,378
>> Oh, yeah.

608
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,337
>> I don't double dip,

609
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:50,712
even if I'm here.

610
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,840
>> Mom, you don't have a

611
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,842
choice here.

612
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,676
>> Does she look different

613
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,260
to you?

614
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:56,718
Does she look thinner?

615
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,846
>> She looks thinner.

616
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,514
I know on the, on the computer

617
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,306
screen, her face looks, you

618
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,016
know... bony.

619
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,768
I-I was really worried about

620
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,562
Eliza just being out here.

621
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,314
I was worried about bug bites.

622
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,692
I was worried about parasites.

623
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,359
I was worried that she wouldn't

624
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,611
be flossing every day.

625
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,697
I was worried about Ebola virus.

626
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,448
I was worried about all these

627
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,784
things in the sea, the-the-the

628
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,952
coral and the things that can

629
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:22,578
cut you and the fish that can

630
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,370
bite you, and...

631
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,916
I was worried.

632
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,209
I don't know how good my letter

633
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:29,918
was.

634
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,086
>> Your letter was great.

635
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:31,920
It was fine.

636
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,546
There's definitely a possibility

637
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,339
that people are very resentful

638
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,716
that I won that challenge and

639
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,008
they didn't.

640
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,926
It could definitely work to my

641
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,594
disadvantage, but hopefully, if

642
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,387
she bonds with them, that could

643
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,596
help me.

644
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,264
It was supposed to be me or

645
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:42,723
Leann gone on day six.

646
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,433
The first time the women lost,

647
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,684
it was either Eliza or Leann,

648
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,935
and it was all-- You want to

649
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,561
know why it was?

650
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,270
What their reasoning was?

651
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,771
I talked too much.

652
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,816
>> You're too annoying.

653
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,154
>> Answer me this.

654
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,447
This morning I asked Twila, I

655
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,617
said, did you, Scout, Chad and

656
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,284
Chris have a plan to vote off

657
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,912
Eliza and then Ami next, and she

658
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:05,746
said, "That was Scout's idea."

659
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,622
>> Yeah, it was Chad's.

660
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,623
>> That's what she told me.

661
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,582
>> She said it was your plan.

662
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,458
She said it was Scout's idea.

663
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,460
>> And I was like, "What?"

664
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,586
>> When I came out here,

665
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,253
I was determined to play the

666
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,923
game with integrity and honesty

667
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,174
and truth, and if they that

668
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,508
didn't work, then I'd lie, cheat

669
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,092
and steal.

670
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,052
We've now reduced ourselves to

671
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,054
the lie, cheat and steal part.

672
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,515
It was Chad's idea, and that is

673
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,184
the God's honest truth.

674
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,560
Didn't we have an agreement when

675
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,020
we came over here, no matter

676
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,897
what anybody says, we're gonna

677
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,856
stick together.

678
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,941
>> I said we'd stick together

679
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,233
when we came over, but I never

680
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,902
made any promises about

681
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,195
Final Four with you, Scout.

682
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,321
>> Well, I thought you had.

683
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,658
I thought that the three of us

684
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,283
plus Twila, that we would, that

685
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,326
we would go to the...

686
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,452
>> We didn't ever say

687
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,454
anything about the Final Four.

688
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,456
>> So I did a little

689
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,415
damage control there.

690
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,626
But Leann and Ami have backed

691
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,377
out of their alliance with me,

692
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,336
that we would go all the way to

693
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,255
the end of the game together.

694
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,298
Call it Final Four, call it

695
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,466
whatever you want to, we would

696
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,342
go to the end of the game

697
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,178
together and include Twila.

698
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:05,472
>> Have you promised Jules?

699
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,516
>> I have since promised Jules.

700
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,392
>> Okay. So you want Jules

701
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,393
to go to the Final Four?

702
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,436
>> I do.

703
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,650
>> (snarling)

704
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,527
My hackles came up, and they're

705
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,236
still up.

706
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,155
You know, whatever happens, you

707
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,907
know, "Vengeance is mine,"

708
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,952
sayeth the jury.

709
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,554
>> That's cute.

710
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,388
She'll love it.

711
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,099
>> Eliza's mom will

712
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,726
probably be leaving soon,

713
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,102
and everybody's doing a little

714
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:52,686
something that maybe she can

715
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,813
pass on to our loved ones.

716
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,815
>> This is for Laurie.

717
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,691
>> Something for them to

718
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,608
remember us by and let them know

719
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,193
we're thinking about them.

720
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,571
>> This has been so great, Mom.

721
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,698
This has just been so great.

722
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,365
>> There's the boat.

723
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:09,453
>> But Mama....

724
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,749
I love you so much.

725
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,541
>> I love you so much, too.

726
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,294
>> Having my mom here has

727
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:17,919
definitely motivated me and made

728
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,963
me know that I can get through

729
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,673
this and I'm almost there, and

730
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,592
it's just so wonderful that she

731
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,261
got to spend this time with me.

732
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:26,636
>> Take this, too.

733
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,013
Keep warm.

734
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,638
>> Okay.

735
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,097
>> You're a good mom.

736
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,850
>> The shirt off my back.

737
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,434
>> She took the shirt off

738
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,436
her back and gave it to me

739
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,062
because I don't have anything

740
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,816
with sleeves even.

741
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,859
>> She came out and stripped

742
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:41,943
to her panties and left

743
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,862
in only her bra.

744
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,740
She is our kind of woman.

745
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,701
>> ALL: Bye!

746
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,462
>> There's one big one

747
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,755
right there.

748
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,048
>> Ami, Twila and I went

749
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:03,590
to get manioc.

750
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,759
And, you know, I wanted to hear

751
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,345
what Twila had to say about this

752
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,471
whole Chad and Chris scam.

753
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:09,971
>> I could tell you all

754
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,431
kinds of things people's

755
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,141
approached me with, Leann;

756
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:13,642
all kinds of things.

757
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,643
It doesn't matter.

758
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,312
My heart has stayed true to you

759
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,396
and Ami.

760
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,314
>> But you know what?

761
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,398
Any time that any guy comes to

762
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,024
me or talks to me, I tell y'all.

763
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:21,650
Any time that there's anything

764
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,194
said... just, just listen.

765
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,445
Don't get defensive.

766
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,655
Just understand how that kinda

767
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,781
doesn't really look so good.

768
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,907
>> They were trying to

769
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,616
work me like crazy.

770
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,450
>> Why don't you just

771
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,326
shut 'em down?

772
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:31,993
>> Why don't you say,

773
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:32,661
"Absolutely not.

774
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,161
There's no way in hell.

775
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,162
Go run on back to

776
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:34,871
your little buddies and..."?

777
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,789
>> Why do you have to

778
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,123
appease them?

779
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,415
>> Why do you even

780
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,041
listen to two words?

781
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:38,667
"I have nothing to hear.

782
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,669
Nothing... Bye... See ya."

783
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,295
I just think Twila got really

784
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,797
twisted up in her idea of what

785
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,464
making peace is and what the

786
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,008
right and wrong thing to do is

787
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,010
when it comes to a team.

788
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,679
>> I feel like a little

789
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,555
bit of a fool because I do have

790
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,890
some mistrust for you now.

791
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,227
But, um, I give you my word.

792
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,646
>> And I give you mine.

793
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,565
On my son, I swear, and you all

794
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,526
know how much I love that boy.

795
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,361
I swear to you.

796
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,112
>> Do you feel good about

797
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:07,737
that decision?

798
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,530
Because you don't seem like you

799
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,072
feel very good about that.

800
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,616
>> I-I feel guarded.

801
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,577
>> Don't.

802
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,412
Don't feel guarded.

803
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,290
I swore to Ami and Leann on my

804
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,791
son's name that I was with them

805
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,918
100%.

806
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,295
But maybe if I won a million

807
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,588
dollars, God would forgive me.

808
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,380
I don't know.

809
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,424
I hope.

810
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,270
>> Yeah.

811
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,313
>> Julie's pretty much

812
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,315
been my informant.

813
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,566
She informed me that their

814
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,026
flower power again; girls

815
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,027
strong.

816
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,195
Julie let me know that my head

817
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,362
is on the chopping block and I

818
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:49,988
have to win immunity to stay in

819
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,615
the game.

820
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,658
>> "To save your own skin,

821
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,243
you'll need more than just

822
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,328
will, brains and brawn,

823
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,204
determination and skill.

824
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,788
Yes, it's a race, so you must

825
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,581
hurry,

826
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,916
Only one will be safe and

827
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,543
one more joins the jury."

828
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,711
>> The race is on.

829
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:04,920
>> Yeah.

830
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,755
>> I'm going to win

831
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,797
immunity, guaranteed.

832
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,299
That's the prediction.

833
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,300
I'll make it right now.

834
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,092
Daugherty's going to win

835
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:11,593
immunity.

836
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,512
It's a fact.

837
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,649
>> PROBST: First things first.

838
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,733
Take back immunity, Twila.

839
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,611
Immunity back up for grabs.

840
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,657
For today's challenge, you are

841
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,158
going to run it in pairs.

842
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,534
Let's bring in the people you're

843
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,410
going to pair up with.

844
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:37,702
Come on in.

845
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,788
>> Oh, my God.

846
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,706
(cheering)

847
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,208
>> PROBST: I think you know

848
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,209
these guys-- your loved ones.

849
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,210
They're still here.

850
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,712
They're gonna run it with you.

851
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,798
(cheering)

852
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,508
>> Oh, my God.

853
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,759
>> PROBST: All right.

854
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,052
Your loved ones are down to a

855
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,011
one-in-seven shot at a million

856
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:55,762
bucks.

857
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,264
The only way to guarantee they

858
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,432
get to a one-in-six shot is to

859
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,558
have this around their neck.

860
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,102
That's where you're going to

861
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,770
either help them or potentially

862
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,020
hurt them.

863
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,647
Here's how it's going to work:

864
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,815
Each pair will be designated a

865
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:06,982
color.

866
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,775
The loved ones will be

867
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,193
blindfolded.

868
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,987
The survivors will verbally

869
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,780
direct their loved ones to

870
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,823
retrieve three bags of puzzle

871
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,782
pieces.

872
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,993
Once you have all three bags,

873
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,536
take off your blindfold, start

874
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,870
putting the puzzle together.

875
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,705
The first pair to finish their

876
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:25,333
puzzle wins immunity for their

877
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:25,917
survivor.

878
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,294
We will randomly draw for

879
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,086
position.

880
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,172
We'll get started.

881
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:34,801
This is going to be fun.

882
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,720
>> Ow!

883
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,680
>> PROBST: For immunity.

884
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,765
Survivors ready?

885
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,766
Go.

886
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,809
>> Laurie, spread your

887
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,768
feet and walk, walk, walk!

888
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,979
>> Left, Annie, left.

889
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,898
>> To your right, to your right!

890
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:49,232
>> Left, left.

891
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,358
>> To your right, to your

892
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,318
right, Laurie!

893
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,861
Straight, straight!

894
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,987
Go, Laurie.

895
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,363
>> Keep going right, go.

896
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:55,989
Keep going right! Right, right!

897
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,242
>> You're going to your right!

898
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,744
>> Turn around!

899
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,454
Teri, turn around!

900
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,955
>> Keep going, you got it.

901
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,748
You got it!

902
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,541
There you go, babe!

903
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,500
Yeah!

904
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,336
Yoo-whoo!

905
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,213
I love my girl!

906
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,214
>> Straight, straight,

907
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,841
straight, straight.

908
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,343
Right! Right there!

909
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,552
>> Stop!

910
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,595
Stop, Laurie.

911
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,555
No! No! Not there, there.

912
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:21,431
Untie it!

913
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,891
You're going to have to go

914
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:23,892
faster!

915
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,810
>> You got it, baby.

916
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,269
Drop it.

917
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:26,561
Good job.

918
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,228
Now keep walking.

919
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,480
>> PROBST: Crissy, back with the

920
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,189
first bag for Ami.

921
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,441
>> Keep going, keep going!

922
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:31,983
One more!

923
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:32,359
Yes!

924
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,860
That one, yes!

925
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:34,110
That's it.

926
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,904
>> Drop the bag! Drop the bag!

927
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:36,988
>> PROBST: James drops his first

928
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:37,697
bag.

929
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,573
He's back on the course.

930
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,116
>> No, no, no!

931
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,368
Turn around!

932
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,285
Listen to me!

933
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,662
>> PROBST: Susan getting closer

934
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,706
to her daughter, further away

935
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,332
from her bags.

936
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,666
>> Stop! Drop it!

937
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,459
Turn around.

938
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,168
>> PROBST: Laurie has her first

939
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:50,877
bag.

940
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,003
She's heading out for her

941
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:52,879
second.

942
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,130
>> To your right.

943
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,049
Go to your right.

944
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,592
Jimmy, to your other right.

945
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:58,510
>> Come on!

946
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,552
Straight, straight!

947
00:27:59,636 --> 00:27:59,761
Drop it.

948
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,637
>> PROBST: Annie back with her

949
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,429
first bag for Scout.

950
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,640
She's back on the course.

951
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,016
>> I said straight!

952
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,226
Faster, faster!

953
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,268
Straight! No!

954
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,395
>> Good job.

955
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,188
You're coming straight to my

956
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:10,897
voice, baby.

957
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,189
I love you.

958
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,400
Drop the bag.

959
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,734
>> PROBST: Crissy back with a

960
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,777
second bag for Ami.

961
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,529
>> Go around the pole!

962
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,363
Come on, Laurie!

963
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:18,947
Walk faster!

964
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,532
Let's go, Laurie!

965
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,825
Come on, Laurie!

966
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:22,909
Keep coming!

967
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,536
Keep coming, Laurie!

968
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,036
Keep coming!

969
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,371
Nothing in front of you!

970
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:26,871
Drop it!

971
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,831
Turn around!

972
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,082
>> PROBST: Laurie back with her

973
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:29,374
second bag.

974
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:29,749
>> Hurry, Teri!

975
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,251
>> What?

976
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,086
>> Good girl, yes.

977
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,587
Just hop over it.

978
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,966
>> There, there! Left!

979
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,759
Laurie, to your left!

980
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,137
Right there!

981
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,804
Right there!

982
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,390
>> Turn to your right.

983
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:45,932
Turn... now drop the bag.

984
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,934
Drop it.

985
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:48,935
>> PROBST: Take off your

986
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:49,769
blindfold, Crissy.

987
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,604
Ami and Crissy can start working

988
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,313
on the puzzle.

989
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,107
>> Stop, Annie!

990
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,692
Back up, back up!

991
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,693
No, no!

992
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,277
Yes!

993
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,528
>> Drop it!

994
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:58,987
Drop it!

995
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,904
>> PROBST: Take off your

996
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,321
blindfold, Laurie.

997
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:00,989
Start putting the puzzle

998
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,740
together.

999
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,659
>> Come on, baby.

1000
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:08,872
>> I think this goes down here.

1001
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,582
>> Yeah, they got blue on top.

1002
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,168
>> PROBST: It's going to be a

1003
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:13,960
race between the puzzle-makers

1004
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:14,836
now.

1005
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,588
Chris and Laurie

1006
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,631
versus Ami and Crissy.

1007
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,591
>> To your right.

1008
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,049
Drop it.

1009
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:20,842
Take off your blindfold.

1010
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,218
>> PROBST: Scout and Annie are

1011
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:22,510
now in it.

1012
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,428
>> Hurry!

1013
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,220
Take off the...

1014
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,847
>> Come on, come on!

1015
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,182
Take it off, take it off!

1016
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,558
>> PROBST: Take off your

1017
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,142
blindfold.

1018
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:29,684
Justin and Julie are now in

1019
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:30,185
this.

1020
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:30,977
>> Can you hear me, Teri?

1021
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,186
>> No.

1022
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,812
>> Then why don't you

1023
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,856
just sit down and stop?

1024
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,108
>> Right to my voice,

1025
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:37,984
right to my voice.

1026
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,110
Come on, come on, son.

1027
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:39,402
Right there.

1028
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:39,986
Take your blindfold off.

1029
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,071
>> PROBST: James is back with

1030
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:42,822
his third bag.

1031
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,657
Twila and James now working on

1032
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,283
the puzzle.

1033
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:45,950
>> We need something to

1034
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,535
build on.

1035
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,786
>> PROBST: Ami and Crissy having

1036
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,287
trouble with the puzzle.

1037
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,206
Chris working furiously to make

1038
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,957
up time.

1039
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,709
>> Faster!

1040
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,794
Yeah, there you are.

1041
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,587
>> Oh, good.

1042
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,880
>> PROBST: Ami and Crissy

1043
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,714
getting very close.

1044
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,883
Chris and Laurie still fighting.

1045
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,843
Immunity at stake.

1046
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,928
Somebody going home tonight.

1047
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,640
>> Right here, right here.

1048
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:12,685
>> Huh?

1049
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,686
>> PROBST: And they have it!

1050
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,980
Ami wins immunity!

1051
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,496
>> PROBST: All right, guys, fall

1052
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,997
in right here in front of the

1053
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:33,748
towers.

1054
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:37,335
Ami, come on over.

1055
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,086
Turn around.

1056
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,420
Let's put this on.

1057
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,505
Nicely done.

1058
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,464
Good communication with your

1059
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,131
partner.

1060
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,841
As a result, you are safe.

1061
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,260
Tonight's Tribal Council.

1062
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,928
For the loved ones, one of your

1063
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,971
survivors, this game is about to

1064
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:48,137
end.

1065
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,681
Tonight at Tribal Council,

1066
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,473
somebody's going to be voted

1067
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:50,974
out.

1068
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,560
Say your good-byes.

1069
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,653
>> PROBST: All right, loved

1070
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,571
ones, head back the same way

1071
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:04,904
you came.

1072
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,531
You got to go.

1073
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,825
>> Bye, everyone.

1074
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,284
>> Bye, Annie.

1075
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,912
>> Bye, Annie.

1076
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,291
>> PROBST: Sort of a strange

1077
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,834
cacophony of emotion there.

1078
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,918
Tribal Council tonight.

1079
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,003
Somebody else going home.

1080
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,297
You have the afternoon to figure

1081
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,506
out who it's going to be.

1082
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,341
I'll see you at Tribal Council.

1083
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,070
>> So Ami won the

1084
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,406
immunity challenge, and that

1085
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,325
freed us up to vote for who we

1086
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,826
were going to vote for next,

1087
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,828
which was Chris.

1088
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:54,954
For some reason, it didn't feel

1089
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,414
right that Chris was going to

1090
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,498
go home and Eliza wasn't.

1091
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,583
>> I'll go with you.

1092
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,834
>> I'm going to head

1093
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:00,376
down toward that big one.

1094
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,337
>> So we went for a

1095
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,339
little walk in the woods.

1096
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,506
And we decided as a group,

1097
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,549
"Let's talk really, like, who

1098
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,509
deserves to stay."

1099
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,218
>> Something just doesn't sit

1100
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,470
right with me, the fact

1101
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,763
that for some reason,

1102
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,847
it doesn't sit completely right

1103
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,181
with me.

1104
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,724
>> If you had to make a

1105
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,558
make a decision right now...?

1106
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,851
>> It don't matter to me.

1107
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,144
I mean, you all know how I

1108
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,145
feel.

1109
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,605
>> I just feel like we've

1110
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,189
come this far on principle.

1111
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,191
>> Of having all women

1112
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:23,441
together?

1113
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,234
>> Yes, but yet, we did

1114
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,486
vote Lisa off.

1115
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,487
>> We've been talking

1116
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,821
about Eliza getting off every

1117
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,864
damn time.

1118
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:31,032
>> Every time.

1119
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,408
>> I think Chris should go

1120
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,660
next, but it's not setting

1121
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,912
really well for Leann, so if she

1122
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,788
decides that it's not right,

1123
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:37,664
then I'm going to stick with

1124
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,666
what she says.

1125
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,166
>> All right, we've made

1126
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,376
our decision.

1127
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,335
>> GROUP: All right.

1128
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,087
>> We just really hope it

1129
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,631
doesn't mess us up in the long

1130
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,007
run and he wins immunity the

1131
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,133
next couple of times.

1132
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,177
That would be really bad.

1133
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,816
>> So, I mean, it's 100%

1134
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,901
but if it does change,

1135
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,194
I'll tell you, but I don't

1136
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,195
think, I swear...

1137
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,613
>> How, how, how is that

1138
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,197
going to swing, me not going

1139
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,782
home?

1140
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,616
>> Because, I mean,

1141
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,742
everyone just thinks you deserve

1142
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,076
it more.

1143
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,371
Are you surprised?

1144
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,038
>> I'm happy.

1145
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,248
I mean, I'm pumped.

1146
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,626
It's like being in a tornado.

1147
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,544
It is crazy.

1148
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,128
I don't even have to do

1149
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,880
something to change the tide of

1150
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:28,339
the game.

1151
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,424
There's six women living with

1152
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,425
me-- they'll change it

1153
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,427
themselves.

1154
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,429
It can be set in stone who's

1155
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,431
going home, and five minutes

1156
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,224
later, I'm not going home and I

1157
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,600
ain't done a damn thing to

1158
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,268
change it.

1159
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,602
I'm just sitting there by the

1160
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,395
fire.

1161
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,063
So I make my way out to get some

1162
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,440
wood and Twila says to me

1163
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,858
while we're filling this crate,

1164
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,067
"You know, you can change this

1165
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,027
game completely."

1166
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,696
So I'm thinking, "I'm all ears,

1167
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,739
Twila."

1168
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,949
>> Think about it.

1169
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,756
>> Think about it.

1170
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,092
>> You are so right.

1171
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,804
>> If you would just get

1172
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,264
Eliza, say, "If you want to

1173
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,515
change this whole outlook, vote

1174
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,684
this way, you've got three other

1175
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,935
people backing you up."

1176
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,770
>> Guaranteed?

1177
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,604
Scout's a guarantee?

1178
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,813
>> Guaranteed.

1179
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,815
I swore on my son's name.

1180
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,441
May God forgive me for saying

1181
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,275
that, because it's not the right

1182
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,402
thing to do, but it's time for

1183
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,404
something to change.

1184
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,364
Ami and Leann just act like

1185
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,449
they're so much better than

1186
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,533
everybody else and they've got

1187
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,868
this all wrapped up in their

1188
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,494
back pocket, and, and it just

1189
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,245
freaking pisses me off.

1190
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,335
>> 'Cause right now, I'm

1191
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:47,835
still in...

1192
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,753
>> I'm not going to.

1193
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,420
You have my word.

1194
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,464
I'm not going to, Twila.

1195
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,384
>> I'll get this.

1196
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,761
Am I willing to do it?

1197
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,386
Damn right I'm willing to do it.

1198
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,179
I'll turn the tide, I'll take

1199
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,223
the risk right now.

1200
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,808
So I talked to Eliza.

1201
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,518
Here's the bottom line:

1202
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,143
Julie told me, "You're staying,

1203
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,604
you're not going home tonight.

1204
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,481
We're voting for Eliza."

1205
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,816
That's the exact words I was

1206
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,983
told, okay?

1207
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:11,442
Listen, Eliza.

1208
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,319
You don't have to go home

1209
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:13,778
tonight.

1210
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,362
All's you got to do is one

1211
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,488
thing.

1212
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,823
>> Okay, what do I have

1213
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,031
to do?

1214
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:18,366
>> This is how you can stay.

1215
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,242
>> Chris pulls me aside

1216
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,159
and says, "Twila and Scout

1217
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,869
discussed with him the

1218
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,578
possibility of changing this

1219
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,704
game around, and the only way

1220
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,706
to do it would be with my vote.

1221
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,125
>> You have my word,

1222
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:27,834
I swear to you.

1223
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,668
>> But I don't trust

1224
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,460
Scout and Twila, that's what

1225
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,169
scares me.

1226
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:30,628
>> You do not have to

1227
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,254
worry about Scout and Twila.

1228
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,296
I swear, I have talked...

1229
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,590
>> I think this is a big

1230
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,092
plot and I'm gonna go home.

1231
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,260
>> I don't know how to

1232
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:37,593
reassure you.

1233
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,470
I am just telling you the truth.

1234
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,304
I've never lied to you.

1235
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,222
I'm not using you.

1236
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:41,681
>> But the thing that

1237
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,140
worries me is that Scout and

1238
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,517
Twila are lying to both of us.

1239
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:51,190
>> Just please take this risk.

1240
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,249
>> PROBST: Now bring in the

1241
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,667
jury.

1242
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,711
Sarge and Chad, voted out at

1243
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:16,132
the last Tribal Council.

1244
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:16,340
Okay.

1245
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,801
The last three days have had a

1246
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,511
lot of emotion.

1247
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,054
Eliza, did having your mom here

1248
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,432
wake you up to how close you

1249
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,143
are to winning this thing?

1250
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,269
>> Um, yes, having gotten

1251
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,854
to the point of the family visit

1252
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,689
in this game made me realize

1253
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,232
how far along we really are,

1254
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,358
because we have talked about

1255
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,152
this on day seven maybe, and it

1256
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,112
was, it was a long-term goal for

1257
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:38,404
all of us.

1258
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,239
>> PROBST: Chris, what was it

1259
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,407
like to be in an immunity

1260
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,451
challenge where, clearly, you,

1261
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,202
of all people, have definitely

1262
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,996
felt on your heels for a while.

1263
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:47,622
Now you have your fiancée, who

1264
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,332
can help you or hurt you in

1265
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,541
this game, depending on how well

1266
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,584
you do?

1267
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,002
>> I knew that, uh, she

1268
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,087
was wanting to give it 110%.

1269
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,797
It meant a lot to her to come

1270
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,091
through and, you know, get me

1271
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,509
immunity.

1272
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,094
Um, we worked hard together and

1273
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,763
she gave it 110%.

1274
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,139
I love her to death.

1275
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,307
She did a great job today.

1276
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,767
>> PROBST: Now, at the other end

1277
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,976
of the spectrum, Leann, you

1278
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,020
seemed just so happy to have

1279
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,563
Teri there that you were taking

1280
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,356
more of the moment of a

1281
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,316
friendship thing, "Look what

1282
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,609
we're doing together, and if I

1283
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,568
don't win immunity, I don't win

1284
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,486
immunity."

1285
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,571
>> Well, I really wanted to win.

1286
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,406
I mean, I set out to win, but,

1287
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,491
you know, you get halfway

1288
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,576
through and you realize there's

1289
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,953
not a chance in hell you're

1290
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,079
going to win it.

1291
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,080
Then I just thought it was

1292
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:29,997
funny.

1293
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,165
Why not laugh with it?

1294
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:31,749
I'm not going to have her feel

1295
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,458
bad about it.

1296
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,459
That would be horrible.

1297
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,336
>> PROBST: Well, it seems to me

1298
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,712
that Chris, out of everybody

1299
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,339
here, was connecting with Laurie

1300
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,423
in a way like nobody else was,

1301
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,425
which is regardless of what's

1302
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,718
happening, I got to win this

1303
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,844
thing.

1304
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:44,345
>> I didn't tell her it

1305
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,472
was life or death for me.

1306
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,306
I didn't feel like it was.

1307
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,600
>> PROBST: Eliza, once again,

1308
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,851
you brought your bag.

1309
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,978
>> Jeff...

1310
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,062
>> PROBST: You're becoming the

1311
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:53,521
girl who cried wolf.

1312
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,189
>> But you know what?

1313
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,232
It's, like, "Oh, Eliza was

1314
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,108
just being paranoid, Eliza's

1315
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:57,942
just being paranoid."

1316
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,318
And then every time I get back

1317
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,237
to camp and I find out, "Oh, my

1318
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,780
God, I was this close to being

1319
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,072
voted off."

1320
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,991
It is not paranoia.

1321
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,701
It is valid 100%.

1322
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,327
And I very well might be going

1323
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,328
home tonight.

1324
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,079
No joke.

1325
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:10,705
>> PROBST: I don't think it is a

1326
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,081
joke.

1327
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,541
I just know you've said it at

1328
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,375
every single Tribal Council.

1329
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,626
>> And at every Tribal Council,

1330
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,045
I have almost been voted off.

1331
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:18,462
Honestly.

1332
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,381
>> PROBST: Chris, as the

1333
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,882
outsider, is there any tension

1334
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,844
with this tribe, because what

1335
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,138
you guys show me is very

1336
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,806
happy-go-lucky and everybody's

1337
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,849
having a good time.

1338
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:30,933
>> Um, it's me and six

1339
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,268
women-- six women.

1340
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:32,852
There's tension between six

1341
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,520
women.

1342
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,147
I don't care what anybody says.

1343
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,815
I can see and feel the tension,

1344
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,400
and whether it be them playing

1345
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,153
the game and strategizing or

1346
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:42,737
figuring out, you know, who

1347
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,864
they want to go home next,

1348
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,116
there's always that feeling

1349
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:47,700
that, you know, something's

1350
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,493
going on that not all of them

1351
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,120
are always agreeing.

1352
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,288
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1353
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:52,913
to the vote.

1354
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,789
Ami, you have immunity.

1355
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,498
As always, you can keep it or

1356
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,375
assign it to somebody else.

1357
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,752
>> I'm going to keep it.

1358
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,836
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1359
00:38:58,919 --> 00:38:59,920
Ami; everybody else is fair

1360
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:00,296
game.

1361
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:00,755
It is time to vote.

1362
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,133
Leann, you're up.

1363
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,563
>> My vote's for Eliza.

1364
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,773
Um, group consensus.

1365
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,232
Everybody agreed, but you are

1366
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,276
like a little sister.

1367
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:39,877
>> Sorry, Eliza.

1368
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,586
I had to stick with the team,

1369
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,089
and I guess it's your time to

1370
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,132
go.

1371
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,234
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1372
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,277
votes.

1373
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,335
>> PROBST: Once votes are read,

1374
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:22,419
the decision is final.

1375
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,671
The person voted out will be

1376
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,880
asked to leave the Tribal

1377
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,298
Council area immediately.

1378
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,634
I'll read the votes.

1379
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,344
First vote...

1380
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:37,268
Eliza.

1381
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,727
Leann.

1382
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:43,315
One vote Eliza, one vote Leann.

1383
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,483
Eliza.

1384
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,821
Two votes Eliza, one vote Leann.

1385
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,573
Eliza.

1386
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,991
Three votes Eliza, one vote

1387
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,618
Leann.

1388
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,455
Leann.

1389
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,039
Three votes Eliza, two votes

1390
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:04,170
Leann.

1391
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,671
Leann.

1392
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,464
We're tied.

1393
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,716
Three votes Leann, three votes

1394
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,134
Eliza.

1395
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,510
I'll read the last vote.

1396
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,638
12th person voted out

1397
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,932

00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,351
Leann.

1399
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,395
Bring me your torch.

1400
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:33,574
Leann, the tribe has spoken.

1401
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,827
It's time for you to go.

1402
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,756
Well, as the last vote

1403
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,049
was read, there were some very

1404
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,092
smug looks; other faces were

1405
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,136
absolutely shocked.

1406
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,888
Nine days left, this game has

1407
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,848
just been turned on its head.

1408
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,308
Grab your torches.

1409
00:41:59,391 --> 00:41:59,850
Head back to camp.

1410
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,894
Good night.

was a really nice move.

1423

>> You didn't screw me.

1425
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,091
I'm still in the game.

this game.

as soon as we got back to camp.

1431
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,138

>> I am just floored.

1436
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,069
I just got done saying how it

1437
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,529
wasn't a life-or-death situation

1438
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,697
for me at today's challenge.

1439
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,656
I was fooled.

1440
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,115
I was fooled big-time.

1441
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,325
I'd love to know who voted for

1442
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,244
me 'cause I am just freakin'

1443
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:00,828
flabbergasted at how someone

1444
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,247
could just lie directly to your

1445
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:03,455
face.

1446
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,790
I feel like the world's biggest

1447
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,083
idiot.
