1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,900
Welcome to the final
episode of survivor 47.

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,186
It's been a wild ride these last few days,

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,186
starting with operation Italy.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,466
That took out Caroline
and flipped the game.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,116
And that sent Rachel into stealth mode,

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,156
literally crawling through
the sand like a spy

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,806
to listen in on Sam and Andy

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,186
and Genevieve and teeny

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,566
as they plotted her demise.

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,140
So, armed with that knowledge,

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,016
she made the biggest
move of the season.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,830
Played her block a vote and her idol,

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,736
took out Andy in a revenge
vote, flipped the game again.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,140
Then Rachel won her third
individual immunity challenge

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,280
and used that leverage
to take out Genevieve.

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,186
And now we're down to four:

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,016
Rachel, sue, teeny and Sam.

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,736
Two of them are gonna sit right here.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,186
The other two will be forced to make fire

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,876
to earn that third spot.

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,876
Then the final three will face
their jury and get a chance

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,636
to plead their case about
why they deserve the title

23
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,736
of sole survivor and the
million dollars that comes with it.

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,186
And then we will crown
a winner of survivor 47.

25
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,396
And immediately following
that, we're gonna stay right here

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,706
in this beautiful tribal
council and do the after show.

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,016
It is a very big night for survivor.

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,210
It's the finale of survivor 47.

29
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,040
<i>Previously on survivor.</i>

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,040
I find out so much.

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,800
My god.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,520
<i>I trust her. She shared so much with me.</i>

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,180
<i>My loyalty to Rachel is real.</i>

34
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,566
If anybody has an advantage

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,080
or an idol and you want to play it... Jeff?

36
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,660
I'd like to play it for myself.

37
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,280
Rachel. Does not count.

38
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,426
Thirteenth person voted out

39
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,040
and the sixth member of our jury: Andy.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,080
The tribe has spoken.

41
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,180
All eyes on Rachel right
now. Does she have it?

42
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,776
- Good girl.
- And she does. It's over!

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,426
Rachel has won her
third individual immunity.

44
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,636
<i>My god.</i>

45
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,760
I won immunity when I needed it so bad.

46
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,466
I've never felt more confident
that I'm less confident

47
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,426
in what's going to happen.

48
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,280
Genevieve just spun
me around in circles,

49
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,116
and I'm sick of it.

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,830
Fourteenth person voted out

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,396
and the seventh member of our jury:

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,730
Genevieve.

53
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,426
The tribe has spoken.

54
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,630
They have.

55
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,426
- Final four.
- My god.

56
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,970
Final four, guys.

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,566
<i>I am ecstatic.</i>

58
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,736
I'm in the final four of survivor

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,520
my dream of all time.

60
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,396
- We did it!
- Come on! Final four!

61
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,970
- Final four.
- Final four.

62
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,496
<i>And I am one round away</i>

63
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,210
from having a chance
to pitch my case to win.

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,210
Genevieve is gone. I just want to say

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,736
- it's so crazy.
- Congrats to all of us.

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,736
- I know.
- That girl was a legend.

67
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,520
<i>And Genevieve is gone.</i>

68
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,806
So, right now, I am
riding the highest high

69
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,210
of my entire 23 years of life.

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,016
There were... How many
people have we beaten?

71
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,590
- Fourteen.
- How did that happen?

72
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,156
<i>My daughter Chelsea's
last text to me was,</i>

73
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,806
"mom, I want you to know,

74
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,806
"if you get voted out the first day,

75
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,806
we're still so proud of you."

76
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,636
And now I'm here in the final four.

77
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,986
- You guys, final four.
- Final four.

78
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,466
<i>It's the craziest thing,</i>

79
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,256
<i>and I want to scream
at the top of my lungs.</i>

80
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,590
Sam, we got to final four

81
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,016
and we never wrote
each other's name down.

82
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,016
- Yeah. How about that?
- I'm pretty proud of us.

83
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,736
<i>I'm at the final four
of survivor, and it's this</i>

84
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,900
weird, like, hybrid of being fulfilled

85
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,016
and being motivated.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,450
- How you feeling, Sam?
- Feeling like...

87
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,016
Big day tomorrow.

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,536
<i>Because my dream was
not to come on survivor</i>

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,450
<i>and get fourth place.</i>

90
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,326
<i>My dream was to be the sole survivor,</i>

91
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,016
and I really feel like I'm one day away.

92
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,390
We're gonna wake up
on day 25 on survivor.

93
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,116
What a concept.

94
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,636
<i>Tonight I'm just,</i>

95
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,326
like, happy and feel
in a celebratory mood

96
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,450
and just, like, want to kind of take it all in.

97
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,566
<i>The last few votes, I've
had to win to survive,</i>

98
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,760
<i>and I'm not gonna stop competing now.</i>

99
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,970
<i>I feel like this immunity
challenge coming up</i>

100
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,116
<i>is the last stand, the final battle</i>

101
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,156
<i>for the four of us,</i>

102
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,110
<i>and it's the most important of them all.</i>

103
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,180
Come on in!

104
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,080
What in the world?

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,830
Take it in.

106
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,806
This is what stands between
you and a million dollars.

107
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,970
Four big smiles.

108
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,566
They're nervous smiles, Jeff.

109
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,156
Yeah, they're scared smiles.

110
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,706
They should be.

111
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,700
Wow.

112
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,280
So, here we are, day 25.

113
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,876
You've made it to the final four.

114
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,706
You have one immunity challenge left.

115
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,140
Shall we just get to it?

116
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,450
All right.

117
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,760
First things first, Rachel.

118
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,560
For the third time, got to
take back the necklace.

119
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

120
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,590
For the last time, immunity
is back up for grabs.

121
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,636
<i>For today's challenge,
you're gonna crawl</i>

122
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,566
<i>under a muddy net.</i>

123
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,256
<i>You'll then use a long
pole to unweave a rope.</i>

124
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,450
<i>Once you have that rope,</i>

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,876
<i>you'll use it to lower a gate.</i>

126
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,520
<i>You'll run through it and
collect a bag of letter tiles.</i>

127
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,760
<i>You'll need those tiles to
solve a combination lock.</i>

128
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,396
<i>That'll release a machete.</i>

129
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,520
<i>You'll use the machete
to drop the ladder,</i>

130
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,946
<i>climb to the finish where you will race</i>

131
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,730
<i>to solve a hanging bat puzzle.</i>

132
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,140
First person to finish wins immunity,

133
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,450
is guaranteed a spot in the final three.

134
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,450
You will be at that final tribal council,

135
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,186
where you will get a chance
to plead your case to your jury

136
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,900
about why you deserve
the title of sole survivor

137
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,156
and the million dollars that comes with it.

138
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,496
You also have power because you decide

139
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,086
who sits next to you in that second spot

140
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,566
and who you force to make
fire to earn that final spot.

141
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,016
Which means one of the four
of you will be forced to make fire

142
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,876
and you're gonna lose
and your dream is gonna fall

143
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,760
one day short.

144
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,736
Only way to prevent
that from happening:

145
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,280
Win right now.

146
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,706
Yeah.

147
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,210
Biggest challenge of the season.

148
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,350
We'll draw for spots. We'll get it on.

149
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,186
All right, here we go.

150
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,760
For immunity, guaranteed
spot in the final three,

151
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,140
survivors ready?

152
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,806
Go! First, you're going
back through mud again.

153
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,426
Day 25, survivor 47.

154
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,210
You want it, this is where you step up

155
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,156
and grab it.

156
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,590
Sam through, Rachel's
through, teeny's through.

157
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,280
Come on, sue! Let's dig!

158
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,280
Now you're gonna untie

159
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,566
a long pole and use it to unweave a rope.

160
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,970
You need that rope.

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Sam has his pole.

162
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,450
That pole has a little bit of a u.

163
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,496
You can use that u to grab that rope

164
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,256
and push it up and over those pegs.

165
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,700
It is Sam in the early lead.

166
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
Rachel's starting to get the hang of it.

167
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,736
Teeny doing a nice job.

168
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,210
Sue has her first bit of rope.

169
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,256
Sam figuring it out.

170
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,946
Once you're there, knock off the ball.

171
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,156
Sam has his.

172
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,606
Now you got to untie more
knots, get through that little gate.

173
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,636
Rachel has hers.

174
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,970
It is Sam and Rachel.

175
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,736
You should be used
to these knots by now.

176
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,800
They are a staple on survivor.

177
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,450
Sam is through his knots.

178
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,186
Rachel's through hers.

179
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,706
Sam and Rachel pulling ahead.

180
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,180
Gonna use that ball
to try to lower the gate.

181
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,520
Sam almost does it with his first shot.

182
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,426
Rachel just misses.

183
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,970
Here comes teeny working on her knots.

184
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,760
Sue working on her knots.

185
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,326
You got to figure out the slack,

186
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,326
'cause you need that ball to travel.

187
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,776
Sam's a little short.

188
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,086
Here comes teeny and sue.

189
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,940
Everybody in this.

190
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,496
Sue launches. No.

191
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Teeny launches.

192
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,946
Rachel has a shot if she
can get it to come down.

193
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,326
Close. Will it work?

194
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,760
Rachel's done it! She's through first!

195
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,520
Rachel now working on her letter tiles.

196
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,280
It is Rachel in the lead.

197
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,186
Big immunity on the line.

198
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,140
Everybody fighting right now.

199
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,390
Gonna use the letter tiles, try
to solve that combination lock.

200
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,636
Sam still trying to lower his gate.

201
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,140
Teeny's still working on her gate.

202
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,870
Sue working on her gate.

203
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,086
Sue... Lowers her gate.

204
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,116
Let's go, sue!

205
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,396
Sue falling through.

206
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,830
That's 25 days of exhaustion on survivor.

207
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,706
Rachel still in the lead.

208
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,210
You've got letter tiles
to help you solve this.

209
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,970
You've got a clue.

210
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,256
Teeny and Sam still struggling.

211
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,970
Now is when you
really feel that pressure.

212
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,450
Teeny drops her gate.

213
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,086
Teeny now working on the letter tiles.

214
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,466
Here goes Sam.

215
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,520
Sam very close. Can he get it to drop?

216
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,450
Sam has his gate! You're through.

217
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,210
We got a challenge!

218
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,706
Got a clue, you've got letter tiles.

219
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,566
You're trying to solve that one word.

220
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,916
Sam quickly gets his letter tiles.

221
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,900
Everybody now on the combination lock.

222
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,156
It's a word this time, not numbers.

223
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,010
It's what you need to do now.

224
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,140
Sam thinks he has it.

225
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,566
And he does. Sam got it very fast.

226
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,590
Covers his word up so nobody can see it.

227
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,420
Sam, with one SWAT,
knocks down his ladder.

228
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
Rachel has it.

229
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,040
Does not cover it... leaving it open.

230
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,080
Now Rachel's gonna cover it.

231
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,180
Sam heading up to
work on that bat puzzle.

232
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,256
Rachel drops hers. Got
to get through the knots.

233
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,256
Teeny solved it.

234
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,116
It is Sam in the lead.

235
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,396
Rachel now heading up her ladder.

236
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,490
Teeny trying to drop her ladder.

237
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,520
Sue has the word.

238
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,186
Still taking her a while
to get it. She's got it now.

239
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,320
Rachel now joins Sam.

240
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,520
Sue will be up here soon.

241
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,706
Teeny's now trying to drop her ladder.

242
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,466
Still working with that machete.

243
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,630
Sam did it in one SWAT.

244
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,280
Sue has hers. She's heading up.

245
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,520
Let's go, teeny!

246
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,590
Here comes sue.

247
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,876
Sam with another
piece on this bat puzzle.

248
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,520
It would be Sam's

249
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,970
first individual immunity
win of the season.

250
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,420
Rachel's at three.

251
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,280
Teeny drops hers!
Everybody's still in this.

252
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,010
One piece at a time.

253
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,590
Sam with another piece.

254
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,466
Here comes teeny.

255
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,970
Sue is quickly getting into this puzzle.

256
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,280
Sue has won one individual immunity.

257
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,086
Teeny has not won.

258
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,140
Sam has not won.

259
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,736
We know Rachel's story.
She's trying to tie a record.

260
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,210
Four women have won
four immunity challenges,

261
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,566
but Sam is ripping through this early.

262
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,016
Puzzles have not been his friend so far,

263
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,466
but today might be a different story.

264
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,326
Teeny looking for another piece.

265
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,140
Sue trying to find one.

266
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,116
It is Rachel and Sam right
now side by side and very close.

267
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,876
Rachel with another piece.

268
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,830
Sam looking to place another piece.

269
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,086
Will it fit?

270
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,970
No!

271
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,806
Rachel with another piece.

272
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,760
And another.

273
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,420
Now Rachel in the lead over Sam.

274
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,186
Sue is in it, down on the end.

275
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,490
Teeny's in it.

276
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,086
Teeny, just gonna go right
next door. "I'm just gonna look."

277
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,116
Now Sam's doing the same thing.

278
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,760
No pride on survivor.

279
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,496
What that means is you're looking

280
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,466
at somebody else's puzzle.

281
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,830
That means you are trailing.

282
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,520
Rachel with another piece.

283
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,900
Rachel starting to pull away now.

284
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,496
There have been over 350
woman that have played survivor

285
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,280
over 46 seasons.

286
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,590
Only four have won
four immunity challenges.

287
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,660
Rachel down to three pieces.

288
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,490
Rachel down to two pieces.

289
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,876
Rachel down to her last piece.

290
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,350
Rachel thinks she has it.

291
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,760
She does not.

292
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,946
Something is not right.

293
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,560
This challenge is still alive.

294
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,140
That is opening the door
for everybody else. What is it?

295
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,900
Puzzles look right
when they are finished.

296
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,776
Your life in the game
is on the line right now.

297
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,806
Keep fighting.

298
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,736
Rachel making a switch.

299
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,636
Is that it?

300
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,900
That's it! Rachel's done it!

301
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,116
Claims a spot in the final three

302
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,830
and in the survivor hall of fame.

303
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,560
Wow, what a final challenge.

304
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,140
Rachel, come on over.

305
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,140
For the fourth and historic time,

306
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,876
immunity is yours.

307
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,566
You're in a very elite group now.

308
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,566
Only five women... including yourself

309
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,396
over 46 seasons

310
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,466
have won four individual immunities.

311
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,086
The biggest thing is you
are guaranteed a spot

312
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,590
in the final three. So,
what is the feeling, knowing

313
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,280
you accomplished the
goal, you made it to the end?

314
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,590
I don't have words right now, Jeff.

315
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,466
I mean, to be standing
here with this necklace on

316
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,466
it's overwhelming and it's incredible.

317
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,706
And yet, at the same time, in my gut,

318
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,210
I, like, knew I could do this.

319
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,426
And I just think that,
like, everything I do in life,

320
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,736
I do with incredible determination.

321
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,876
And I didn't know if I could do it out here,

322
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,496
and I'm so proud that I-I have.

323
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,830
Congratulations.

324
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,830
So, tonight at tribal,
you have a lot of power

325
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,946
'cause you're gonna decide,

326
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,900
between Sam, teeny and sue,

327
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,256
who you put in that
second seat at the final three

328
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,116
and which two players you
force to make fire to earn it.

329
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,116
You have the afternoon to figure out

330
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,946
what you're gonna do
with that big decision.

331
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,946
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Grab your stuff, head out.

332
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,970
See you tonight at tribal council

333
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,970
for the final fire-making showdown.

334
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

335
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,256
<i>Rachel wins immunity yet again, and</i>

336
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,496
I feel defeated.

337
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,016
<i>I've tried to knock her out of this game,</i>

338
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,326
<i>I've tried to beat her at a challenge,</i>

339
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,776
<i>but my plan has been foiled.</i>

340
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,326
<i>And I know pretty much immediately</i>

341
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,280
I'm making fire for my life tonight.

342
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,180
Ooh.

343
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,876
<i>The feeling right now
is a little bit of disbelief</i>

344
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,326
that this is where I am
right now in this game.

345
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,450
You're forever in the hall of fame.

346
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,900
It's... I'm so proud of you.

347
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,900
- Thank you.
- Yeah. That was kick-ass.

348
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,086
<i>I've tied an immunity record.</i>

349
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,450
It never occurred to
me that I could win four.

350
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,256
- Well, I'm gonna go wash off.
- I'm gonna go wash off, too.

351
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,086
<i>And so, the fact that I'm tying.</i>

352
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,946
<i>Jenna morasca, Chrissy
hofbeck, kim spradlin</i>

353
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,876
<i>and Kelly wiglesworth... that's</i>

354
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,760
so cool. But it also

355
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,496
<i>reminds me that Kelly
and Chrissy didn't win,</i>

356
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,086
<i>and they both got to the end.</i>

357
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,256
<i>And so, I have to make
the right decision tonight</i>

358
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,116
<i>when it comes to fire-making
so that I set myself up</i>

359
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,326
to truly clinch this win.

360
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,776
- I need to go under.
- Yeah, me too.

361
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,730
Let's just do it, okay?

362
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,450
Yeah. I mean, I can just tell you.

363
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,186
Like, you two are going
to fire. I'm not gonna, like,

364
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,730
hold a...

365
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,900
No, I know, I know, I know, I know.

366
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,016
<i>Sue has been the only loyal ally I've had</i>

367
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,256
<i>in this late stage of the game, and this</i>

368
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,426
wouldn't feel right without
her sitting next to me

369
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,946
in the final three.

370
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,450
After tonight, one of us will
no longer be in the game.

371
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,520
<i>And the person I know</i>

372
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,806
<i>that I want in fire tonight is Sam.</i>

373
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,396
<i>He is someone that I've been trying</i>

374
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,086
<i>to get out for a long
time, and I think I could</i>

375
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,970
put myself into fire if I needed to.

376
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,116
And I was prepared,
if I lost the challenge,

377
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,210
that I was going to fire tonight.

378
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,900
But I think that

379
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,086
<i>when I take a step back
and I look at my game,</i>

380
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,450
<i>I don't think that knocking
Sam out directly is going</i>

381
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,496
<i>to elevate me in any substantial way.</i>

382
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,466
<i>And teeny could be a formidable,</i>

383
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,736
like, opponent to Sam.

384
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,520
You're gonna let me make fire?

385
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,800
- Yeah.
- All right.

386
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,140
- I'm down.
- I'm down, too. I have no choice.

387
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,760
Like, you don't need to be like that.

388
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,806
- Like what?
- Arrogant.

389
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,140
I'm not arrogant.

390
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,256
"You're gonna let me make fire?"

391
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,396
<i>My worst-case scenario
was Rachel winning</i>

392
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,256
<i>because I knew that she would
put me and Sam into fire-making.</i>

393
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,156
I've been threatened by Sam

394
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,016
since before we even
met out here on this island,

395
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,736
in the sense that he's super smart,

396
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,326
<i>he's charismatic,</i>

397
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,876
<i>and he knows this game
like the back of his hand.</i>

398
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,800
And a part of this game is fire.

399
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,520
- Shut up!
- I swear, I've never made a fire once.

400
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,156
- You've never sparked the flint?
- No.

401
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,350
I don't want to hear
from you until tonight.

402
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:54,946
It's okay.

403
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,760
<i>Sam is telling us, you
know, he never practiced fire.</i>

404
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,140
But in my mind, it's all a
ruse to try and get in my head.

405
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,426
All right, well, I need to practice.

406
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,170
It's a shame I don't
know how to make fire.

407
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,256
I'm leaving.

408
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,706
<i>I'm just sick of Sam.</i>

409
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,450
<i>And the last thing I need right now,</i>

410
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,086
when I'm about to compete against him

411
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,116
in such a high-pressure situation,

412
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,280
is him pulling these mind
games yet again on me.

413
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,876
You just want the, like,
best shavings possible.

414
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,876
Hold your knife like this.

415
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,876
And then put the
knife on the... like, here.

416
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,280
Yeah.

417
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,590
I see what you mean.
I think I'm getting it.

418
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,156
<i>I want teeny sitting
with me in the final three.</i>

419
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,520
And so, I'm like, "I will help you, teeny."

420
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,760
You're, like, sparking really
well, and you got flame. Okay.

421
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,190
<i>Teeny needed a little bit of
encouragement, and she needed</i>

422
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,900
<i>a little bit of technique change,</i>

423
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,520
and she's killing it.

424
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,760
Okay.

425
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,830
I hope Sam doesn't
know what he's doing.

426
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,210
- I hope Sam doesn't know what he's doing.
- Me too.

427
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,806
Just go slow.

428
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,566
<i>Thank god that Sam sucks at doing fire.</i>

429
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,566
<i>We all thought Sam was lying to us,</i>

430
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,326
<i>that he actually has been practicing fire,</i>

431
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,186
<i>and that he was gonna be good.</i>

432
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,186
He's not good. It's-it's, like, pathetic.

433
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,970
He's gonna feel like an idiot, honestly.

434
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,490
Just take a breath.

435
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,426
<i>What I've seen from Sam today</i>

436
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,520
I could easily beat him in fire.

437
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,086
<i>But I'm gonna go with
what Rachel wants to do</i>

438
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,760
<i>and just sit and be able to relax tonight,</i>

439
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,566
<i>knowing that I'm going to the end.</i>

440
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,010
How's it going?

441
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,426
No idea how to do this.

442
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,496
<i>I've gone 25 days.</i>

443
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,326
<i>I maybe touched a flint one time.</i>

444
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,776
Very bad for me right now
because now I'm starting to wish

445
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,520
I would have done a little bit more

446
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,450
<i>to prepare for this potential moment.</i>

447
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,660
<i>Like, making fire is a
foreign concept to me.</i>

448
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,590
<i>And it makes me really
nervous that teeny has a coach</i>

449
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,326
<i>like Rachel who definitely
knows what she's doing,</i>

450
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,566
<i>and I've got no help.</i>

451
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,590
<i>I know everybody's rooting against me.</i>

452
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,116
Guess who's at camp,
pissed that he's not getting ...?

453
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,466
I believe him.

454
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,806
He doesn't know what he's doing.

455
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,970
- He's playing it up.
- I don't know. Maybe.

456
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,426
- But he looked, genuinely annoyed.
- Thank you.

457
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,426
- Genuinely.
- That actually helps.

458
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,536
<i>I feel like teeny has really</i>

459
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,396
gotten her confidence up.

460
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,520
<i>She's ready to take on Sam.</i>

461
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,426
- I'm proud of that.
- You should be.

462
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,560
<i>And I believe she will best him tonight.</i>

463
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,186
<i>I think that she knows what she's doing.</i>

464
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,806
<i>She just has to go in and not panic.</i>

465
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,636
That looks good.

466
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,760
<i>And have the confidence
to get this done.</i>

467
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,566
That you?

468
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,086
Yeah.

469
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,806
<i>When I see teeny is
making fire, I'm like, "crap."</i>

470
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,396
<i>I'm in way over my head tonight.</i>

471
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,590
I'm scared.

472
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,876
I'm worried a little bit, you know?

473
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,280
I...

474
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,700
You don't want to play 25
days and come up that short.

475
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,186
And I can... Feel it
slipping away a little bit.

476
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,140
So... I'm afraid of what's gonna happen.

477
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,280
I'm afraid of looking like an idiot.

478
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,426
I'm afraid of everybody at home saying,

479
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,520
"why didn't you practice fire?"

480
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,730
And me saying, "I don't know."

481
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,736
<i>And then I pulled out
my letters from home,</i>

482
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,700
<i>and there was something
that my dad wrote to me.</i>

483
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,946
<i>He had written that he knew</i>

484
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,566
<i>I would give it absolutely
everything I have out here,</i>

485
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,830
<i>and that he wasn't gonna bet against me.</i>

486
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,806
<i>And the thought of him rooting for me...</i>

487
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,700
<i>Told me, "you're not one to quit."</i>

488
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,080
<i>That really fired me up.</i>

489
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,520
<i>I'm not ready to go
home. I want to see day 26.</i>

490
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,776
<i>I've got to find a way</i>

491
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,830
<i>to get myself to the end of this game.</i>

492
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,210
<i>I'm on survivor for a reason.</i>

493
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,636
<i>The second you let your brain
start to get to a point of doubt</i>

494
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,566
<i>is the second that you've lost.</i>

495
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,040
<i>And I'm not ready to go there yet.</i>

496
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,806
<i>I-I can't believe it.</i>

497
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,080
<i>I made a fire and I-I built it up.</i>

498
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,520
<i>And that's when I said,
let's go into tribal council</i>

499
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,280
<i>with some momentum
and let's go to war.</i>

500
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,426
<i>Right now, the only thing
standing between me,</i>

501
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,496
and the final tribal council,

502
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,016
<i>and a chance at a million dollars</i>

503
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,210
is one fire.

504
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,086
Is a flame burning through a rope.

505
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,426
<i>It is the biggest opportunity</i>

506
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,590
<i>I've ever had to change my
life and accomplish a dream</i>

507
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,116
that I've been working towards

508
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,326
since I was a conscious,
living human being.

509
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,776
<i>I have scrapped my way all the way</i>

510
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,450
<i>to the end of this game on my own.</i>

511
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,086
<i>So, I'm hoping that
tonight I can find a way</i>

512
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,140
to find a way yet again.

513
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,830
Now bring in the members of our jury.

514
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,326
Okay.

515
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,156
So, let's talk about today's challenge.

516
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,706
Rachel, you win your fourth

517
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,086
individual immunity challenge

518
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,140
and in doing so, you accomplish
the goal of every player,

519
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,706
which is tomorrow night
at final tribal council,

520
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,156
you will get a chance to face
your jury and make your case

521
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,086
about why you're the player

522
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,900
that is most deserving of the title

523
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,326
of sole survivor and the million dollars

524
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,876
that goes with it.

525
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,590
We also have to take a moment

526
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,256
to formally acknowledge

527
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,140
that, with your fourth
individual immunity win,

528
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,016
you join a very elite group of women.

529
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,876
Out of 47 seasons and 24 years,

530
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,496
only five of you have ever
won four individual challenges.

531
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,636
Sam, the other side

532
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,086
of Rachel winning four is the reminder

533
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,520
that of the four other women,
only two of them won the game.

534
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,806
This is not a slam dunk
that this season is over.

535
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,210
It's just recognizing a big
achievement from a player.

536
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,450
Yeah, absolutely. Like,
I, like everybody else,

537
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,450
am overjoyed for Rachel,
but at the same time,

538
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,520
the necklace doesn't
win you a million bucks.

539
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,466
And as a player in the
game, and hopefully,

540
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,970
as jury members out of the game,

541
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,566
we're able to separate the idea

542
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,186
of history that should be
recognized and admired

543
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,560
and what it takes to
outwit, outplay and outlast.

544
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,736
And, Rachel, that brings us to
the other part of winning today

545
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,156
is this power you have
that comes with a decision.

546
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,970
Which of these three do
you give that second spot

547
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,186
at the final three and which two players

548
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,186
do you force to go make fire and earn it?

549
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,520
Yeah. I feel like

550
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,210
I could go to fire and try to take out Sam,

551
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,806
but I also feel like

552
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,706
I earned this necklace
today in a challenge

553
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,900
and I don't think that I need to give it up

554
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,736
to do another challenge and prove

555
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,086
whatever that proves.

556
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,636
I mean, I came into this game

557
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,520
being extremely loyal to the people

558
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,450
that I wanted to ally with.

559
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,466
And what I learned pretty quickly is that

560
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,496
none of them were as loyal to me

561
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,426
as I was willing to be loyal to them

562
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,830
until I found sue.

563
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,946
And sue has genuinely been

564
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,946
the most loyal person to me

565
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,590
and so I only feel like it is
fair to bring her to the end.

566
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,396
And so teeny and Sam

567
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,496
- will be making fire.
- So, sue,

568
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,186
- you're in the final three.
- I am.

569
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,140
Thanks to Rachel.

570
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,086
So, teeny, two things
of note that Rachel said.

571
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,326
One is she's rewarding sue for loyalty.

572
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,210
What she also said is,

573
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,760
"I could have taken a
shot at fire to take out Sam."

574
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,736
So, does this create an
opportunity for you? Does this

575
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,140
surprise you? What do
you make of that statement?

576
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,116
I feel like I have an
acute sense of awareness

577
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,280
of what these people think of me,

578
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,186
how they underestimate
me in this game, but it doesn't

579
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,466
matter, necessarily, what

580
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,916
these people think of me. It matters what

581
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,830
these people think of me and it matters

582
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,876
that I get to the point

583
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,736
to be able to pitch my case.

584
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,426
So, this is absolutely an opportunity.

585
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,590
And it's funny that it's me
and Sam because I would say

586
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,426
Sam and I have had a
complicated relationship,

587
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,900
and it's more my end of things.

588
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,566
"It's not you, it's me"?

589
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,086
Yes, absolutely. I would say that

590
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,156
I've had a bit of a one-sided rivalry

591
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,016
with Sam, and to open
up about it honestly

592
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,466
is that I look at Sam
and I see a handsome,

593
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,590
smart, athletic, strong guy.

594
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,450
And Sam's somebody who,
probably when he was younger,

595
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,830
got a lot of, like, attention from girls.

596
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,706
The teachers wanted
him to be the kid who was,

597
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,566
like, moving the desks
around the classroom.

598
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,116
- Moving desks?
- And, like, that's kind of the thing

599
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,156
that I always wanted to be doing, and,

600
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,900
because of, you know,
my identity and my gender,

601
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,900
just to say it, like, that's not
necessarily the experience

602
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,970
I've gotten, and I've worked
really hard to get to a place

603
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,706
where I'm more confident
in, like, this version of myself

604
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,636
and how I present to the world now.

605
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,156
And I'm still working through things.

606
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,210
So, when I see Sam, he's done nothing,

607
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,636
honestly, throughout this
game but try and work with me.

608
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,156
But I've projected insecurities onto him

609
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,520
and I've tried to get him out,

610
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,760
on top of the fact that I
do see Sam as a threat

611
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,900
and a really good survivor player, too.

612
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,970
So, right now, the two of us making fire,

613
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,426
it's an opportunity for
one final showdown.

614
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,450
And if I can beat him,

615
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,326
that's a great end to the story for me.

616
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,760
And if I can't, then I'll
have more to say after.

617
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,776
Sam, how about for you?

618
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,426
Opportunity?

619
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,566
Yeah, i-I'm excited for the opportunity.

620
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,210
I'm at peace with the result tonight.

621
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,140
I'm ready to plead my case.

622
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,636
I'm ready to fight like hell.

623
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,970
Last I checked,

624
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,156
yeah, my torch still has fire in it,

625
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,496
so I'm ready to go.

626
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,970
All right.

627
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,876
So, here's how it's gonna
work. Teeny and Sam,

628
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,736
you're gonna take a spot
at the fire-making stations.

629
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,186
Pick whichever one you want.

630
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,326
I'm gonna give you both a minute

631
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,760
to take a look at your supplies,

632
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,326
figure out how you're gonna start this

633
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,466
fire-making showdown,
and then we'll go.

634
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,420
Sam?

635
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,636
All right, it is time for
the fire-making showdown

636
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,876
between teeny and Sam.

637
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,116
Create a fire

638
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,590
that burns high enough and hot enough

639
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,140
to burn through that rope

640
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,806
and raise a flag. You do that,

641
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,140
you're in the final three.

642
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,520
You don't, you're out

643
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,186
and become the eighth
member of our jury.

644
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,636
Are you ready to begin?

645
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,830
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

646
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,800
Good luck. Begin.

647
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,496
Takes three things to make a fire.

648
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,016
You need fuel.

649
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,946
That can come from the magnesium.

650
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,426
That can come from
the husk you're using.

651
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,520
You need heat. That's gonna

652
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,736
come from striking that flint.

653
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,736
And then you need air.

654
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,450
Fire's got to breathe in order to burn.

655
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,326
Lots of different ways to
approach making a fire.

656
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,466
Both players prepping a little bed,

657
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,706
now scraping magnesium.

658
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,086
That's a great igniter.

659
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,706
And you get the heat you need

660
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,210
from striking that flint

661
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,390
and get a little bit of a spark.

662
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,876
Teeny has a baby flame. Can she get it?

663
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,760
- That hessian is limited in supply.
- Yes. There you go.

664
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,566
It'll burn quickly.

665
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,186
And it'll burn out just as fast.

666
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,876
Key is you got to
make something happen

667
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,970
while you have the flame.

668
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,736
Teeny is nursing that fire,

669
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,776
adding little pieces of kindling.

670
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,156
It looks like it might be
positioned just under that rope,

671
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,940
which is where you want it.

672
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,636
Sam continues to work,

673
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,870
trying to get his first real flame.

674
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,396
Teeny has kept her fire going
and it's starting to increase.

675
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,876
She's adding more sticks.

676
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,490
This could be a million-dollar fire.

677
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,466
Teeny's fire continues to burn.

678
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,900
Sam yet to get a flame.

679
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,256
Still a long way from burning
through that rope with that

680
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,426
wind starting to blow.
That's gonna be a factor.

681
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,140
Sam now feeling the desperation,

682
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,350
trying to get it to spark
and hope it ignites.

683
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,210
Teeny is doing a nice
job, slowly nursing that fire.

684
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,466
Now that flame's starting to burn higher,

685
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,566
nicking that rope.

686
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,566
Sam continues to try
to fight to get in this.

687
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,900
Teeny's flame is now
starting to hit that rope.

688
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,256
You can see the fibers
on that rope lighting up.

689
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,520
Little by little, that rope is getting frayed.

690
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,450
There's another burn of the rope.

691
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,156
It's right under the rope now.

692
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,830
Sam needs to get something
going to have a shot at this.

693
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,210
Sam's got a flame going now.

694
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,140
Sam trying to get back into this.

695
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,450
He's got to make something
out of that flame quickly.

696
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,940
Can he nurse that into something?

697
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,016
Teeny's fire now with a
gust of wind. That helps.

698
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,186
- Yeah.
- Keep going.

699
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,806
Anything that lifts it closer to the rope.

700
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,116
She's got a good foundation.

701
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,156
Sam is trying to build a foundation

702
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,590
without smothering it.

703
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,140
Blow, blow.

704
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,676
Sam is trying to get his going higher.

705
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,946
Can he catch teeny
and make a game of this?

706
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,946
Teeny adds another stick and another.

707
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,870
That flame is burning
all around that rope.

708
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,186
Sam's got a flame going now.

709
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,806
Can he catch teeny?
We got a showdown now.

710
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,116
Two fires. This is very close.

711
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,566
Teeny and Sam for a
spot in the final three.

712
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,876
Teeny's rope continues to burn.

713
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,636
It's got to break and pop that flag.

714
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,566
Sam is right there in it.

715
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,296
He's trying to get that
flame, coaxing it up.

716
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,760
- Come on!
- Teeny has an inferno.

717
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,970
Teeny is all over that rope.

718
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,590
It's only a matter of time before it pops.

719
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,396
Would be a huge comeback

720
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,010
if Sam could burn his
rope before teeny's.

721
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,830
Sam's got a big fire.
He's burning his rope.

722
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,566
Now the wind is blowing
teeny's away from the rope - no!

723
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,520
- And Sam's into the rope.
- Yo. - No!

724
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,250
- Unbelievable turn of events!
- Come on, baby.

725
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,080
This could come down to
seconds being the difference.

726
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,776
Come on, baby.

727
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,970
- Let's go!
- Sam pulls it out!

728
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,776
- Come on!
- An unbelievable comeback

729
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,210
- in the 25th day of season 47.
- Holy cow.

730
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,466
- My god!
- Sam will earn a spot

731
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:03,326
in the final three, and a dejected teeny.

732
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,116
- Find a way to find a way!
- Wow.

733
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,830
Never seen a fire-making challenge

734
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,490
- that close, ever, on survivor.
- Wow.

735
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,450
You did really well, teeny.

736
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,280
All right, teeny and Sam,
take your spots back over here.

737
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:40,116
Teeny, it takes so
much to get on survivor.

738
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,636
It takes so much to get through day one,

739
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,806
then day two, all the way to day 25.

740
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,806
All the things you've
endured to get to this spot

741
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,140
and to get that close and to still fall short.

742
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,730
It's the stakes of survivor.

743
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,520
But it doesn't mean it's
not terribly disappointing.

744
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,940
So, what is the feeling right now?

745
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,466
Obviously, I'm heartbroken, and...

746
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,520
It is something I'll
have to deal with forever

747
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,946
that right there, that rope still not burned.

748
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,830
But I'm at peace as well,

749
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,426
because I played this game

750
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,496
exactly how I always knew that I would.

751
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,466
I played this game
exactly how I live my life.

752
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,496
I played this game 100% as teeny

753
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,946
because that's the only
way that I know how to be.

754
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,186
And at least I can go out now saying

755
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,116
that I believe I would
have won if I got there,

756
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,450
and I'll just never know.

757
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,706
And, as I said, losing
to the big handsome jock

758
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,876
it's just another part of the story

759
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,210
that I got to deal with.

760
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,590
Well, teeny, I got to say,

761
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,210
it's been a pleasure
having you on the show.

762
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,426
I respect everybody who plays survivor.

763
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,466
I've never played,

764
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,900
but I've been a witness
to every single person

765
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,970
who has played this game for 24 years.

766
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,140
And I continue to learn life lessons

767
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,736
from all of you,
including you this season.

768
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,900
So, thank you for braving survivor

769
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,280
and coming out here and
fulfilling your childhood dream.

770
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,970
Jeff, thank you for giving it to me.

771
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,900
I can't even believe I'm looking
at you in the eyes right now.

772
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,636
And that is something that
I will carry with me forever.

773
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,186
So, I'm happy. I know I did my best.

774
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,876
There's nothing more I could have done,

775
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,736
and that's how I'll go on.

776
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,450
And fittingly, in survivor,

777
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,776
the other side of this story is you, Sam.

778
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,396
Teeny gave it everything
she had. She came up short.

779
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,736
You looked like you
had absolutely no shot

780
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,876
to even get a flame. Did
you have any moments

781
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,876
where you said, "I'm done.
I'm not gonna get there"?

782
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,900
The moment that you let your brain

783
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,140
get to, "I'm out,"

784
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,520
it's self-fulfilling, in a way.

785
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,350
But I think the story of my game

786
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,970
has been one of
resilience, so, I'm elated.

787
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,830
All right, teeny,

788
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,760
it's time. Need to grab your torch.

789
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,946
Can we have hugs?

790
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,730
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

791
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,116
Bring it in, brother.

792
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,140
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks. You too.

793
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,900
Never wanted to do this.

794
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,156
But it's a part of the journey.

795
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,736
It's a part of the journey.

796
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,490
Teeny, the tribe has spoken.

797
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,466
- Time for you to go.
- Thanks, Jeff.

798
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,080
- Thanks for being out.
- Thank you for letting me.

799
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,326
You smell good.

800
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,450
- Bye, teeny.
- Good luck, guys.

801
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,116
Rachel, sue, Sam, congratulations.

802
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,116
You made it to the final three.

803
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,116
Tomorrow night, as you know,

804
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,566
the power in this game
now shifts to the jury.

805
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,326
Eight players that you
had a hand in voting out

806
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,116
will decide who wins this game.

807
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,186
Prepare, be ready.

808
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,830
You have one more night here in Fiji.

809
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,140
Try to get some sleep.

810
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,466
You're gonna need it. Grab your torches.

811
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,520
Head back to camp. We'll
see you tomorrow night.

812
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,490
- Good night.
- Good night.

813
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,326
<i>I do think</i>

814
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,140
that moment will haunt
me for the rest of my

815
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,116
<i>time on earth. But I've had to overcome</i>

816
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,760
<i>a lot of emotional hardships out here.</i>

817
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,636
Throughout my life, I've obtained

818
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,566
this sort of sidekick energy.

819
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,256
<i>And out here I've learned to,
you know, be my own best friend,</i>

820
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,116
<i>and it'll help me live my real life</i>

821
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,140
in ways I never did before.

822
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,520
<i>- Day 26!
- Day 26!</i>

823
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,520
<i>Talk about an alarm clock. Hello.</i>

824
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,140
<i>- Good morning, sunshine!
- Good morning.</i>

825
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,520
<i>Final three. I want to</i>

826
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,450
scream! I'm so pumped! I'm so pumped.

827
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,016
I'm final three.

828
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,590
<i>Today is actually my
birthday, and I'm 59 today.</i>

829
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,706
<i>- My god!
- I see a big old thing.</i>

830
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,186
My god! Chocolate croissants!

831
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,520
What?!

832
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,156
<i>It was glorious.</i>

833
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,946
I've had some good rewards out here,

834
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,326
but this was just special.

835
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,466
<i>- Survivor 47.
- 47.</i>

836
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,806
<i>Survivor history right here.</i>

837
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,560
- Final three, baby.
- Final three.

838
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,140
<i>The final breakfast is an iconic</i>

839
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,210
survivor moment that you only

840
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,140
dream of when you step
on the mat on day one.

841
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,280
- Sam's first watermelon, day 26.
- My first watermelon, day 26.

842
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,426
I don't love it. I'll eat it. I don't love it.

843
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,736
You're crazy.

844
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,140
<i>The war is on pause until tonight.</i>

845
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,970
<i>Breakfast this morning is a peace treaty</i>

846
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,116
for the remaining soldiers
to look at each other

847
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,736
<i>and just take a break from the chaos</i>

848
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,450
that is in this game.

849
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,876
I might suggest we get
the skillet started here.

850
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,590
- You need help with the fire?
- He's got the fire.

851
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,736
<i>In historic survivor fashion, I come</i>

852
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,760
from behind, I win the
fire-making challenge.

853
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,250
I earn my spot in the final three.

854
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,520
<i>But now, the fate of my game</i>

855
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,776
lies in the hands of the jury

856
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,776
<i>eight people that I contributed</i>

857
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,660
<i>to leaving this game.</i>

858
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,496
<i>Talk about our fallen...</i>

859
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,590
- Yeah.
- Fallen friends.

860
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,806
Sierra... <i>first member of the jury,</i>

861
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,326
<i>the most beautiful
sunshine on this season.</i>

862
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,140
<i>Gone too soon.</i>

863
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,010
For me, especially.

864
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,496
<i>There's a lot of things in this game</i>

865
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,560
that Sam did that makes him a winner.

866
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,636
<i>Sam is somebody, once he sets a goal,</i>

867
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,970
he will make it happen.

868
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,900
<i>So, it's, like, I think he
could do that tonight.</i>

869
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,326
- Who's next?
- Sol.

870
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,496
<i>- Sol.
- He is such a cool guy.</i>

871
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,876
Hey, Mr. Miyagi.

872
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,186
<i>When we met on the merge beach,</i>

873
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,116
<i>we instantly had a connection.</i>

874
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,660
Somebody sent me an advantage.

875
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,326
Yeah.

876
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:19,970
<i>Here's what I know
about Rachel's game.</i>

877
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,280
She got a lot of advantages.

878
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,776
<i>But I do believe</i>

879
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,706
<i>that the majority of it wasn't just luck.</i>

880
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,086
<i>Rachel makes people
feel very, very comfortable.</i>

881
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,426
She's an impressive girl.

882
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,760
So, who was after sol?

883
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,086
- Gabe.
- Gabe. Gabe.

884
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,806
<i>Gabe was intense.</i>

885
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,450
<i>The scariest player in this game to me.</i>

886
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,086
He was the only one I confided in.

887
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,016
<i>He was a good guy.</i>

888
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,706
<i>Sue played an unbelievably loyal game.</i>

889
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,590
That is a very powerful
thing in the game of survivor.

890
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,186
<i>And if sue wants to
get my vote, she needs</i>

891
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,830
<i>to show that her loyalty</i>

892
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,776
<i>was conscious loyalty and something</i>

893
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,280
that she was putting on sale.

894
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,900
- Who went after Gabe?
- Kyle.

895
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,186
- Kyle.
- Kyle.

896
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,256
<i>A guy who, two seconds</i>

897
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,536
into my first conversation
with him, I knew he had to go.

898
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,636
<i>Kyle, safe tonight at tribal council.</i>

899
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,520
<i>I will forever have respect for somebody</i>

900
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,636
<i>who can bust it that hard.</i>

901
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,140
He's got more drive than I
think I've ever had in my life.

902
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,186
<i>Sam deserves to win because I think</i>

903
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,946
<i>that he played his
underdog story perfectly.</i>

904
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,226
I mean, he owned being at the bottom,

905
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,426
<i>and he found a way to find a way.</i>

906
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,970
<i>Who was after him?</i>

907
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,776
- Caroline. -Sweet Caroline.
- Sweet Caroline.

908
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,566
<i>I knew if your Caroline didn't go</i>

909
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,250
that the three of you would
be sitting here at the end.

910
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,946
<i>Sue was the most loyal</i>

911
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,256
alliance partner you could ever have.

912
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,450
<i>Sue played her game the sue way,</i>

913
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,700
<i>and that's absolutely undeniable.</i>

914
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,776
- Who's after her? Yeah.
- Andy. -Andy.

915
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,590
My god. Andy.

916
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,086
<i>He was somebody who seemed like</i>

917
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,606
he didn't know what
he was doing out here.

918
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,186
They don't like me.

919
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,876
<i>And the minute that I
picked him up, I realized,</i>

920
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,040
"whoa, you're good."

921
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,760
<i>I wanted to trust Andy, and I, like,</i>

922
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,520
could not for a single moment trust him.

923
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,056
- Okay, can we, like...
- Work together?

924
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,396
- Maybe we can work together.
- Actually work together?

925
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,706
- For real.
- Yeah, let's do it, Andy.

926
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,280
<i>Rachel established herself</i>

927
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,156
as the threat of threats.

928
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,396
<i>She's made history with her ability</i>

929
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,946
<i>in these challenges, and so,</i>

930
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,086
she has to have a
really good shot tonight.

931
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,256
- Who's after Andy?
- Genevieve.

932
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,320
That's... wow.

933
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:23,760
<i>I feel like Genevieve and I</i>

934
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,970
<i>immediately clocked each other.</i>

935
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,760
<i>"I was like, " this girl is smart</i>

936
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,636
<i>and I am scared of her."</i>

937
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,016
I think she felt the exact
same way about me.

938
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,900
<i>Rachel wrapped her hands around</i>

939
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,210
the control that I so desperately wanted

940
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,016
<i>and wouldn't let it go,</i>

941
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,086
<i>which is incredibly impressive.</i>

942
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,520
<i>I want Rachel to stand
up at final tribal and tell</i>

943
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,970
everyone how much
better she is than them.

944
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,566
- And then we have teeny.
- Teeny.

945
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,450
<i>It's apt her name is teeny because</i>

946
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,900
<i>she is the biggest
personality, the biggest force.</i>

947
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:00,706
<i>So much better at this
game than I expected.</i>

948
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,946
<i>Sam had to be extremely scrappy.</i>

949
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,296
People did not want to work with him.

950
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,466
He was a pariah at
many times in this game.

951
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,830
<i>But he always found a foothold
and he always found a way out.</i>

952
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,520
<i>Sam made it to the end by truly</i>

953
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,630
<i>playing the game of survivor.</i>

954
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,016
Three of us. How far

955
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,320
did you guys realistically think

956
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,776
you would make it
coming into the game?

957
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,830
I wouldn't have

958
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,140
come out here and played
if I didn't think I could win.

959
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,806
<i>I'm ready to go head-to-head with Sam</i>

960
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,876
<i>and ready to kind of</i>

961
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,156
catch the grenades he
throws in my direction

962
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,806
and lob them right back at him.

963
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,016
I would say the same thing.

964
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,536
I thought, like, I would be good at it,

965
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,520
but there's been a lot
of times that I felt like,

966
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,016
- "all right, this is the end of my rope."
- Yeah.

967
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,366
"All right, this is the end of my rope."

968
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:46,706
And then I found new rope.

969
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,566
<i>I know that I'm going in
against a heavyweight.</i>

970
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,706
<i>But my story is one that's root able, one</i>

971
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,760
that the jury is gonna want to get behind.

972
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,590
Where do you think
your turning point was?

973
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,776
I think you'll find out tonight.

974
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,256
I think we'll have to talk about it tonight.

975
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,140
<i>I am the guy that nobody could get rid of.</i>

976
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,350
The scrappy player of survivor 47.

977
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,806
<i>And all of the lows that I've
been through in this game,</i>

978
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,396
all of the fighting is worth it,

979
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,256
'cause I've got a shot,
and I know I've got a shot.

980
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,520
<i>This is my one last chance to give myself</i>

981
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,706
my birthday gift that I've
been wanting to give myself.

982
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,086
<i>I know that Sam and Rachel
are up there high-fiving.</i>

983
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,830
<i>Those two feel that they're one and two</i>

984
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,876
<i>and I'm just gonna be
the goat, but everyone</i>

985
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,636
underestimated me.

986
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,140
<i>I downplayed myself the
whole time and I fooled them all.</i>

987
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,280
<i>I'm still coming in with the
mentality of an underdog</i>

988
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,830
<i>because that's when</i>

989
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,280
<i>I perform my best, is when I am</i>

990
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,900
backed into a corner and my only option

991
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,806
<i>is to kick ass.</i>

992
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,760
<i>Going into final tribal council</i>

993
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,900
<i>is a lot like going into fire-making.</i>

994
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,186
<i>I'm the underdog and I might look dead,</i>

995
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,140
<i>but you never know</i>

996
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,706
when I'm gonna strike
that last second flame.

997
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,900
<i>Tonight, I'm not just hoping for fire.</i>

998
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,040
<i>I'm hoping for fireworks.</i>

999
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,156
<i>I do not know what name
I'm writing down tonight, and</i>

1000
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,706
if I don't see someone own their game

1001
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,806
<i>like they're cooks, they're not getting</i>

1002
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,426
<i>this million dollars.</i>

1003
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,186
<i>You need to explain</i>

1004
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,830
how you executed your strategy.

1005
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,086
<i>It's not gonna just be given to anybody.</i>

1006
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,496
I want them to be sweating

1007
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,086
<i>when we're asking
these questions tonight.</i>

1008
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,636
<i>This season is gonna
come down to the wire.</i>

1009
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,210
<i>Tonight is gonna be a verbal bloodbath.</i>

1010
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:44,326
All right.

1011
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,806
Welcome to your final tribal council.

1012
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,900
Congratulations. This
is as far as you can go.

1013
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:53,256
You survived every
tribal council you attended

1014
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,450
and you made it to the final three.

1015
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,186
And now it's one of
the most unique aspects

1016
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,256
of the survivor format.

1017
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,016
The power shifts from

1018
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,496
the players in the game to the players

1019
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,946
voted out of the game. It is the jury

1020
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,326
who ultimately decides

1021
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,086
who will win any season of survivor.

1022
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,156
Tonight, they're going to
be asking you questions.

1023
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,636
They're looking for information.

1024
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,970
This is your final test.

1025
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,280
You got to figure out

1026
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,946
"what is it they want to hear from me?"

1027
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,256
Jury, I'm gonna give you a minute

1028
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,110
to gather your thoughts,
and we will get started.

1029
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,636
All right.

1030
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,806
Let's get to our final tribal council.

1031
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,496
Jury, who's gonna get us started?

1032
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,970
Think I'll kick it off.

1033
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,606
- All right, Gabe.
- I think Gabe will. - Gabinator.

1034
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:46,900
So, first and foremost, a
very, very big congratulations

1035
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,566
- to all three of you.
- Thank you.

1036
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,830
You accomplished a
remarkable milestone in this game

1037
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,450
just by sitting there, and I really hope that

1038
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,706
you're proud of yourselves.
With that being said,

1039
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,566
I will kick it off with the first question,

1040
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,706
and we'll start with Rachel

1041
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,900
and we can just go down the line.

1042
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:04,210
How do you think... not hope

1043
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,326
how do you think your
game will be remembered?

1044
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,396
And is that even important to you?

1045
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,520
I think my game will be remembered as...

1046
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,876
Someone that fell on
their face pretty hard

1047
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,396
and had the ability to adapt and go from

1048
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,830
the most underdog,
the most left-out person

1049
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,280
in this entire room to

1050
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,426
someone that became a threat.

1051
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,466
And as much as that does matter,

1052
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:33,156
I didn't come in trying
to have a survivor legacy.

1053
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,590
I came in to play survivor. So,

1054
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,490
no, I don't really care
how I will be remembered.

1055
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,156
I think my game will be
remembered as scrappy,

1056
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,396
a guy who never gave up on himself,

1057
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,280
found a way using creative strategy,

1058
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,566
social adaptability,

1059
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,520
using some charm, using some humor,

1060
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,140
using some self-deprecation

1061
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,736
to get himself to the end.

1062
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,140
And it does matter to me

1063
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,636
how my game is remembered.

1064
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,466
I want to leave feeling proud of myself,

1065
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,256
and other people are...

1066
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,110
You know, admire me, in a way.

1067
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,426
- Thank you.
- Yeah, so,

1068
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,806
something that's very important

1069
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,280
that I need to share with all of you is that

1070
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:19,496
today, back home, is my birthday,

1071
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,636
and I'm not in the 40s.

1072
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,010
I'm actually 59.

1073
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,760
- Wow.
- So, if I were to win,

1074
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:29,590
I will go down in history

1075
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,736
as being the oldest
woman to ever win survivor.

1076
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,210
And my legacy is that I
get to have my grandson,

1077
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:43,016
who's five years old, see
his grandmother make it

1078
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,140
all the way through
this whole entire game

1079
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,396
being truthful and honest,
and I want to teach him

1080
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,086
that loyalty is something

1081
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,970
that can make good guys finish first.

1082
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,970
Sue, I definitely agree.

1083
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,806
Your game was, like, all about loyalty.

1084
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,326
- Yeah.
- So, do you view lying and deception

1085
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,156
as negative traits in
someone's survivor game

1086
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,396
- and as sort of anti-loyal?
- No, not

1087
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,396
I expected all of that.

1088
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,520
Look, I'm not dumb. You know, like,

1089
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,466
"tweedleydee," whatever,
but you know, like...

1090
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,396
"Tweedleydum"... that's not me.

1091
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,140
So, I won't judge
anybody for who they are.

1092
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,870
I just know I have to judge myself.

1093
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,806
- All right. Caroline.
- All right.

1094
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:26,280
So, I would love to hear

1095
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,736
what you believe is your
biggest mistake in this game

1096
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,736
and how you recovered from it.

1097
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,086
- Let's have Rachel go first.
- Sure.

1098
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,116
Then Sam, then sue.

1099
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,016
So, I started this game
not on a good footing.

1100
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,116
I miscalculated and I didn't understand

1101
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,776
how much game was
going on around me.

1102
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,520
And then we hit the merge.

1103
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,496
You all voted out Sierra. I was like,

1104
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,806
"my god, what is going on?"

1105
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:53,396
And I decided to course-correct

1106
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,636
and completely change my game.

1107
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,280
I tried to build bonds with lavo

1108
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,016
and I tried to reconnect with Andy

1109
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,496
and I had a relationship with sol

1110
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,830
and I started trying to
cross-check everything.

1111
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,426
I even snuck up on people.

1112
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,086
The night of your vote-out,
Caroline's vote-out,

1113
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,210
Genevieve, teeny, Andy and Sam

1114
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,016
they just went to the beach.

1115
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,116
And I followed them down
there and I laid under a bush

1116
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,970
and I listened to their
entire conversation.

1117
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,086
I found out that they were
all completely against me,

1118
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,876
that Genevieve had an idol,

1119
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,806
that teeny told them about my advantage

1120
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,970
that I got from the journey,
that Andy had flipped.

1121
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,706
That entire conversation
is a ruse, though.

1122
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,330
Like, that was already a premeditated...

1123
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,636
But to push back on that, you know,

1124
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,016
I did reveal that she had a
block a vote advantage, which

1125
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,326
- does reveal that I was against her.
- Which we are...

1126
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,636
And if I hadn't known that,
I would not have known

1127
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,350
about the next day to play by idol.

1128
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,496
Okay.

1129
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,520
- Sam?
- Yeah. I think

1130
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,396
my biggest mistake in this game

1131
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,736
was not tying up loose ends.

1132
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,520
Things like throwing Andy's name out

1133
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,830
as a potential hinky vote ended up

1134
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,426
losing me a lot of trust with allies.

1135
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,426
But I learned that

1136
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:04,760
this group of people
loved sharing information

1137
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,776
and I pivoted to kind of try and

1138
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,590
weaponize it a little bit.

1139
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,636
Things like a fake idol that
I can make with Genevieve

1140
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,450
and leak information to teeny

1141
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,706
can then help me make a strategic play

1142
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,760
that flips the game
and taking you out of it.

1143
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:20,760
I just want to ask a follow-up on that.

1144
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,776
When you chose to reveal
that information to me

1145
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,590
and I brought it to Rachel and sue,

1146
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,520
- right.
- They did not believe you.

1147
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,396
Further, in a way...

1148
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,156
- Right.
- That didn't really matter at all.

1149
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,916
- To us.
- Well, it mattered because I didn't

1150
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,496
want teeny out of the game.
It was important -right, I'm s...

1151
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,016
To my game to get Genevieve.

1152
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,900
Me too. I'm saying that,
like, even if it had been real,

1153
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,636
it would have decoyed on you,

1154
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,140
- which was also fine with us.
- Sure.

1155
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,450
Yeah, we would... it... We
didn't think twice about it.

1156
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,876
I think I have enough
from that, thank you. Sue?

1157
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,830
So, Andy, I say this
with the deepest of love.

1158
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:59,970
You lied to me three
times and you blindsided

1159
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,520
sweet Caroline.

1160
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,830
So, believing you a third time

1161
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,156
that was my greatest mistake.

1162
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,250
Awesome.

1163
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,450
Satisfied, Caroline?

1164
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,590
- Yes.
- Sol, get in on this. -Yeah.

1165
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,760
So, as a fan watching this game on TV,

1166
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,760
you know, I have criticism to give players

1167
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,946
and I'm like, "what a stupid
move. Why would you do that?"

1168
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,186
And when you come out here

1169
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,116
and play you realize that

1170
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,830
watching it on TV, you don't know...

1171
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,776
And so, for Rachel,

1172
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,156
here's what I believe to
know about your game.

1173
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,590
I gave you the safety without power vote,

1174
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,016
which saved you in the game.

1175
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,900
You found an idol
clue in the French fries.

1176
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,396
You had a block a vote,

1177
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,466
and you made a historic run with

1178
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,016
the immunity challenges.

1179
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,210
Give me one thing

1180
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,396
that I don't know about your game

1181
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,256
that will blow my mind.

1182
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,086
I think final six, when I
knew I was in trouble,

1183
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,830
I don't think I could have played that idol

1184
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,210
any more effectively.

1185
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,900
Having every single person in the game

1186
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:03,140
sell your game to the jury for you

1187
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,590
without you actually leaving
the game... that was something

1188
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,280
that I've never seen on survivor.

1189
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,706
That was something

1190
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,366
that I'm really proud of that I pulled off.

1191
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,706
Okay, so, a follow-up to Sam.

1192
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,116
Eulogizing Rachel... it backfired on you.

1193
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,326
So, my response to Rachel

1194
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:19,970
I was very intentional with the idea

1195
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,830
of elevating Rachel's threat level.

1196
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,140
I had to gas somebody up

1197
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,520
in front of everybody else so that

1198
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:29,776
nobody's looking at me,
everybody's looking at Rachel.

1199
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,466
So, I was able to navigate the game

1200
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,806
without the protection
of an immunity necklace.

1201
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,876
I was able to put another
threat above myself.

1202
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,980
Think the problem is you
didn't take the threat out.

1203
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,426
Saying you can't beat someone

1204
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,776
in front of the jury and then
going to the end with them

1205
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,970
is not a strategy that I
think is a very smart one.

1206
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,636
But you made it clear you wanted
me out when you helped teeny

1207
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,830
at fire all day yesterday

1208
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,156
and told me you didn't want to help me

1209
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,086
because "I need Sam out of this game."

1210
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,466
I would rather have Sam

1211
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,876
- out of the game than teeny.
- And that's... I mean...

1212
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,706
And I would have
rather not sit next to you.

1213
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,900
But sometimes people
win immunity challenges.

1214
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,970
It didn't go perfectly,

1215
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,280
but didn't go perfectly for
anybody else sitting here.

1216
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,876
I'm all set, Jeff.

1217
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,040
Andy?

1218
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,636
My question is for Rachel.

1219
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,900
Rachel, Rachel.

1220
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:19,396
Andy, Andy.

1221
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,280
I really believe that
we are the two biggest

1222
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:23,520
super fans out here, so,

1223
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:28,140
I know that coming
into this that the likes of

1224
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:31,186
Mike holloway and Ben driebergen

1225
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,900
are not highly ranked

1226
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,636
- on your winner list.
- Yeah.

1227
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,566
- They're not, personally, right?
- No.

1228
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,496
But here you are, the challenge beast.

1229
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,940
You were, in my opinion,
better than Kyle, who's amazing.

1230
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,496
You run the analytics on it.

1231
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,876
It's better than Kyle's.

1232
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,450
You are the idol-finder, and

1233
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,706
we all know you would be the fire-maker

1234
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,140
if you needed to be.

1235
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,970
And you have the worst voting record

1236
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,566
of this final three.

1237
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,970
- Yeah.
- And so, if you want my vote tonight,

1238
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,016
you really have to reconcile this.

1239
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,636
Yeah, you're right, that

1240
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,566
being Mike holloway in this game

1241
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,186
is not how I ever saw it happening.

1242
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,636
I came into this game thinking that

1243
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,636
my social prowess

1244
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,016
would allow me to
maneuver strategically,

1245
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,806
but I couldn't convince other people

1246
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,140
to do my bidding like I
hoped I could out here.

1247
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,396
It just forced me to find

1248
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,450
a different way to play the game,

1249
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,140
like winning immunity. And yet,

1250
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,830
I had a final-three deal
with teeny and Andy.

1251
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,900
I had a final-three deal
with Caroline and sue.

1252
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:36,466
And I brought all of us together
because I was like, "this five

1253
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,946
this is my best option to protect myself,"

1254
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,566
if I couldn't go on this
crazy immunity run.

1255
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:44,566
I think Rachel said it well when she said

1256
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,830
she couldn't get people
to do her bidding anymore.

1257
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,450
She lost a lot of strategic agency

1258
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,496
and social agency, which was

1259
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,466
the entire purpose of
elevating her threat level

1260
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,426
and taking out one of her numbers.

1261
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:59,016
So, I don't think she can reconcile. It was

1262
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,636
immunities and an idol in fries

1263
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,140
that got her to the end of this game.

1264
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,706
I think it's easier to say that

1265
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,676
from your perspective,
where people weren't totally

1266
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,846
- targeting you because you...
- I got-i got voted for

1267
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,016
more than anybody here.
I'm the only one in the game

1268
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,830
that never voted incorrectly.

1269
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,566
I was voted for at four
different tribal councils

1270
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,706
and received a total of ten
votes throughout this game.

1271
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:22,086
And I was somebody who
you said, multiple times,

1272
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,320
I need out of this game as a threat.

1273
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,110
Sierra?

1274
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:35,636
- Sisi.
- Rachel and Sam, I played my game

1275
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,426
the closest with you both

1276
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,876
and really got to know
you on a personal level.

1277
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,636
And we discussed times at home

1278
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,466
when we hit rock bottom

1279
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,760
and how you overcame that rock bottom.

1280
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:49,086
I really just want to know how you

1281
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,760
translated that in the
game. When you hit a low,

1282
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,116
what did you do to overcome
that low, and, you know,

1283
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,846
how does that reflect, like,
why you should be the name

1284
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:57,760
I'm writing down tonight?

1285
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,536
- Yeah, I... sorry.
- Sam, if you want to take the I...

1286
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,426
Yeah, I think I

1287
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,426
I channeled the joy that I
knew was on the other end.

1288
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:06,156
Like, the thought

1289
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:09,970
of watching an epic,
fire-making duel with my parents,

1290
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,186
the thought of hearing

1291
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,970
my fiancée's voice in
my head telling me, like,

1292
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,396
"don't you dare give up
on yourself." You know?

1293
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,466
And I thought of

1294
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:23,396
being a six-year-old kid watching survivor

1295
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,466
and telling myself and
everybody around me,

1296
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:27,140
"I'm gonna do that one day.

1297
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,706
I'm gonna be that one day."

1298
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:32,800
And I thought of letting
him down, you know?

1299
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,970
And I think that continually fueled me

1300
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,520
when I felt like I was at my
lowest moments in this game.

1301
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:42,326
And it's why I continued
to surprise myself

1302
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,326
and did some things that I didn't expect

1303
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,140
to achieve out here.

1304
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,466
I really appreciate that, Sam.

1305
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:50,280
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1306
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:53,140
My rock-bottom day on this

1307
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,466
entire journey was the
night you went home,

1308
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:56,830
when I went back to camp

1309
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,496
and was like, "I have
no one in this game."

1310
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,210
And I just channeled my husband Derek.

1311
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,590
He wrote me this note before
I came out here that said,

1312
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,426
"any of this pain that
you feel is temporary

1313
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,830
"and you just need to trust your instincts

1314
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,496
and I know you can do this."

1315
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,086
I was channeling him

1316
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,760
in everything that I did
and it just kept working.

1317
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:20,086
And in my everyday life,

1318
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,830
I've had a lot of personal
accomplishments,

1319
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,760
like, in my career, in my life, and I don't

1320
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:29,776
ever own the things that I accomplish.

1321
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,706
And I knew that coming in tonight,

1322
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:33,280
the hardest part about sitting here

1323
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,590
would be, like, owning my
game, truly, and just being like,

1324
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,776
"I am proud of this
game that I've played."

1325
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,016
And that's what I'm hoping
to bring home with me.

1326
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,830
Like, I look at my husband and I see

1327
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:46,466
the most talented artist I've ever met.

1328
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,970
And yet he doesn't have
that much self-confidence.

1329
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,900
And it's really hard for me
to look at him and see that.

1330
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,450
And then I realized that, like,

1331
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,396
that's probably also
what I'm doing, you know?

1332
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,636
And so, I think that I will
take that home with me

1333
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,566
and I hope to be able
to share this with him.

1334
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:06,490
And that is something that
I think will affect my real life.

1335
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:08,706
And Sierra presented

1336
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,140
that question to you two because of

1337
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,636
the personal relationship
that she had with both of you.

1338
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,056
And, you know, I had a
very personal relationship

1339
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,496
with sue out here,

1340
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,806
and I'd like to hear her
answer to that question.

1341
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:20,760
So, I-I found that when I hit my low,

1342
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:23,520
I actually found the strength

1343
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,140
to share with my tribe.

1344
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,706
And even Kyle... like,

1345
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,016
you hugged me and you held me.

1346
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,426
That compassion you all gave to me

1347
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:35,086
gave me so much strength,
knowing I had support.

1348
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,900
I'll forever be grateful for the kindness

1349
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,180
that all of you gave to me
at my times of weakness.

1350
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:46,426
All right, so, jury, great job.

1351
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:48,326
Sue, Sam, Rachel,

1352
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:51,140
I'm gonna give each
of you one final chance

1353
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,016
to address the jury. They've
done a really great job

1354
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,806
of giving you a chance
to defend your game.

1355
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,426
These are your last words
to them before they vote.

1356
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,086
Sue?

1357
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,970
So, at 59 years old,

1358
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,086
I came in here and I was pretty much

1359
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,086
of a beast in my own right.

1360
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,520
I actually won the bucket challenge

1361
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,736
and I could have
outlasted the two gentlemen

1362
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,326
that were there as well.

1363
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,466
Yes, I could have.

1364
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:17,140
You were struggling, Kyle.

1365
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,536
You went head-to-head
with me a couple times.

1366
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,946
- Yeah.
- We've seen how that turned out.

1367
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,466
Well, but again, as a 59-year-old,

1368
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:23,830
I beat all your asses, right?

1369
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,186
I found the beware advantage.

1370
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:30,210
I stayed loyal to the people I
wanted to go to the end with,

1371
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,806
and I did get out the people
I needed to get out and,

1372
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:36,760
I would love your vote.

1373
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,636
Sam?

1374
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,210
I did not play a perfect
game by any means,

1375
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,140
but I think my game was
the most well-rounded,

1376
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:50,280
adaptable, dynamic and creative game

1377
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,210
of the three people sitting up here.

1378
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,806
Social and strategic resilience,

1379
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,210
creative game play.

1380
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,426
I found a way to take control of the game

1381
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:01,736
without raising my threat level.

1382
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,496
I found multiple
pathways to get to the end

1383
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,806
without relying on
winning immunity necklaces

1384
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:11,426
or buying the right item at the auction.

1385
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,636
So, I believe that if you're
looking for the player

1386
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,326
that outwitted, outplayed and outlasted,

1387
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,806
despite being counted out multiple times,

1388
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,520
I deserve your vote tonight.

1389
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:28,466
- Rachel?
- I believe that I am sitting here

1390
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,776
with the most dominant
game of the three of us.

1391
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,760
There were two advantages and one idol

1392
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:37,186
in the post-merge, and
I controlled all of them.

1393
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,776
And that wasn't just through luck.

1394
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,776
It was through social connection.

1395
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,210
It was through stealthiness.

1396
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,466
I had to get an idol when
everyone was at camp,

1397
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:46,736
and then I had to play it in

1398
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,016
a incredibly large fashion

1399
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,946
that I feel like made a huge statement.

1400
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:56,086
I won four immunities and I tied a record

1401
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:57,736
and I'm really, really proud of it.

1402
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,830
And so, I sit here pleased

1403
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,520
with my game and my story,

1404
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:05,566
from going from a super
underdog to a big dog.

1405
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:08,760
And I hope I get your vote.

1406
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,396
All right, jury, great final tribal council.

1407
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:14,876
You asked a lot of thoughtful questions.

1408
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,776
You gave the final three a
chance to defend their game

1409
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,876
and you gathered a lot of
information in the process.

1410
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,760
I'm gonna give you a
moment now to take it all in

1411
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:27,560
and then we will vote.

1412
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:42,186
All right, well, this is
the only time in survivor

1413
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:46,520
when you want to see your
name on the parchment.

1414
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:50,636
For the last time, it is time to vote. Sierra,

1415
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,110
you're up.

1416
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,010
My god.

1417
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,450
I'll go get the votes.

1418
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,396
Well, we've done this 47 times.

1419
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,706
And it's different every time

1420
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,156
because of the players.

1421
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:59,140
Sue, Rachel, Sam,

1422
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,520
you played three very different games,

1423
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,636
but it got you here. The question is

1424
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,280
did it earn you a million dollars?

1425
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:08,876
We're about to crown
a winner of survivor 47.

1426
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,490
I'll read the votes.

1427
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:18,116
First vote:

1428
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,900
Rachel.

1429
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,186
Sam.

1430
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,520
One vote Rachel, one vote Sam.

1431
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,156
Rachel.

1432
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,830
Two votes Rachel, one vote Sam.

1433
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:42,186
Rachel.

1434
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,970
Three votes Rachel, one vote Sam.

1435
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,946
Rachel.

1436
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:51,320
Four votes Rachel, one vote Sam.

1437
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,496
The winner of survivor 47:

1438
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,800
Rachel.

1439
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,396
Well, there it is!

1440
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,706
We have our winner of survivor 47.

1441
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:06,590
All it took was 26 days

1442
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,340
of living in the jungle, playing the most

1443
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:10,450
complicated game of social politics

1444
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,846
that got Rachel a million dollars.

1445
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:13,466
Jury, come on over.

1446
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:16,280
- Celebrate your winner.
- Let's go, let's go.

1447
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:18,116
It was a crazy finish.

1448
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,946
There were a lot of
late-season big moves

1449
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:22,566
that took out of lot of big targets

1450
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,496
and continued to flip the game.

1451
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,946
So, what we're gonna do
now is we're gonna bring in

1452
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:28,736
some champagne, we're
gonna bring in some pizza

1453
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,566
in the beautiful jungles of Fiji here at

1454
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,450
the great tribal council.
We're gonna talk about it all.

1455
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,566
It is the survivor 47 after show.

1456
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:38,760
We'll be right back.

1457
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:41,520
I need a little champagne, too. Let's go.

1458
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,140
Aw, thank you.

1459
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,590
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1460
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,140
What a fun season.

1461
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,280
<i>Up next...</i>

1462
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,450
We have just crowned
our newest winner.

1463
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,280
Rachel, congratulations.

1464
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,280
Andy, one of the worst starts

1465
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:01,140
- yes.
- In the history of survivor.

1466
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:04,110
Here's your first look at survivor 48.

1467
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,520
All right, welcome to the
survivor 47 after show.

1468
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:15,326
There's a lot of energy. We have just

1469
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:17,016
crowned our newest winner,

1470
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,280
Rachel. Congratulations.

1471
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,776
Your name will now be forever

1472
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,086
a part of survivor history as you join

1473
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,256
a very special list of people
who've won this game.

1474
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,706
Your name is also about to
be written down on a check

1475
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,426
- my god.
- For a million dollars.

1476
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:33,016
- My god. - My god.
- So,

1477
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,776
I want to exploit a
moment. The reason that

1478
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,706
I like doing the after show

1479
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:40,116
immediately following is because

1480
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,426
this is as pure as it will
ever get for any of you.

1481
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:45,426
Because you haven't been home.

1482
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:47,450
Nobody knows, outside of this group,

1483
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,706
what has happened. You haven't
been influenced by social media

1484
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:52,736
and all the criticism that'll come with that

1485
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,806
that you don't deserve. So, let's

1486
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:57,706
time-stamp this right now, Rachel.

1487
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,256
- You just won survivor 47.
- My...

1488
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,156
You can let it out.

1489
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,186
What is that feeling -yes.

1490
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:07,140
Of accomplishing something

1491
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,970
- this difficult to achieve?
- I feel like I'm having

1492
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,466
an out-of-body experience, because

1493
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:14,466
it's just so surreal that

1494
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,760
this show that I fell in
love with because I...

1495
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:20,140
The second I watched it, I
was like, "I have to do that."

1496
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,210
And the biggest lesson
I think I walked in with

1497
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,706
is I thought I had such a good grasp

1498
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:26,566
of my strengths and my
weaknesses, and I think

1499
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:30,156
that this game really flipped
that completely on its head,

1500
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,566
and yet I was able to just kind of

1501
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:35,566
work with it and adapt to it and-and

1502
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:37,776
land myself here, and I am

1503
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,776
I'm, like, a little bit in shock,
if I'm completely honest.

1504
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,806
I thought Sam had an
incredible final tribal,

1505
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:45,776
and I genuinely did not know -agreed.

1506
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,776
Where those votes were going,

1507
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,323
and I got very nervous.

1508
01:12:48,347 --> 01:12:49,396
Well, let's see... let's talk about the votes.

1509
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:52,520
With the jury, Rachel got
all the votes except for one.

1510
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:54,566
- Who voted for Sam?
- Kyle.

1511
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:55,806
Kyle, what was

1512
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,086
I know you would vote for yourself.

1513
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:59,900
Kyle, what was the rationale for Sam?

1514
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:03,426
I just... I really appreciate
Sam and I appreciate

1515
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:05,776
where he's headed in life, his sacrifices,

1516
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,760
his ethic, the way that he puts himself

1517
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:09,590
in front of vulnerable situations.

1518
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,566
This man right here means a lot to me.

1519
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:15,970
He's impacted my life
greatly. And I love him for that.

1520
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,590
Cheers.

1521
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,876
To Sam.

1522
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,156
And, Sam, I want to echo

1523
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,426
what Rachel said, which is

1524
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,396
I'm closer to the audience

1525
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,396
than I am to being a player, for sure,

1526
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,900
and I thought tonight's
final tribal was riveting.

1527
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,450
- Yeah.
- So, Sam, when you hear that, even from

1528
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,946
the woman who just beat you

1529
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:36,736
that she said, "I got nervous, that was

1530
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,256
a really compelling argument"

1531
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,776
does that give you a sense of pride

1532
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,396
even though you didn't
get the votes to win?

1533
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,806
Yeah, for sure. I mean,
I'm disappointed not to win,

1534
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,706
but I knew it was an uphill battle

1535
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:48,256
coming in. Like, I just tried

1536
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,846
to come into tonight
with the same mentality

1537
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:52,520
I went into fire with, you know?

1538
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:55,760
Come out fighting and give it my best.

1539
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:58,140
I knew I could make a
compelling case. I felt like

1540
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,426
I played a really good game
that I should be proud of.

1541
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:03,520
And I came into tonight, like,

1542
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:06,806
wanting to win but at peace
with the result regardless.

1543
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,590
And, so, yeah, I'm-I'm blessed.

1544
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,116
Sue, I'm gonna give you a little love.

1545
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,156
I want to share a statistic with you.

1546
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,496
- Okay.
- Forty-seven seasons,

1547
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,210
24 years, 700-some people have played,

1548
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,736
350 have been women.

1549
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,900
There have been 21 women over 50.

1550
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:24,210
That's five percent.

1551
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,520
Of those, there have only been five

1552
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,776
that have made it to the
end. That's a little over

1553
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,806
one percent. You were
in a very rare group.

1554
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:36,806
<i>Survivor is a tough
game once you're over 40.</i>

1555
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:39,326
- Brutal. Yeah.
- And you made it to the end.

1556
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:43,086
- What is that feeling for you?
- I just wanted to represent

1557
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,900
the people of my
generation, to show them that

1558
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:47,876
life doesn't end at 50

1559
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,086
or 60 or 70. It's just...
you-you... you have to

1560
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:53,016
just go for it, and I just went for it.

1561
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,210
And I'm very proud of my game.

1562
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,210
I'm very proud of what I did
and what I accomplished and how

1563
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,970
I achieved it and, all in all, you know,

1564
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,496
it's been, like, the hardest experience

1565
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,760
yet the most beautiful experience,

1566
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:08,086
and I feel like I have a
whole new family here,

1567
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:10,280
and I'm really blessed to be here.

1568
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:11,806
Cheers to sue.

1569
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:14,326
- Aw, thank you.
- Badass.

1570
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:16,016
- Sue.
- Yeah.

1571
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,496
Sue, you were also one of

1572
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,776
a few people to find an idol this season.

1573
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,776
And the way each of you

1574
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,900
found them was very unique -right.

1575
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,946
- Yeah.
- To the situation. Rachel,

1576
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,590
you buy a burger, get some fries.

1577
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:33,016
When did you know there
was something in there?

1578
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,636
Did you see it first

1579
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,086
or did you reach for a fry and feel it?

1580
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:40,186
I went to reach for another
fry and all of a sudden I saw

1581
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:41,970
<i>the piece of paper
sticking out of my fries.</i>

1582
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,086
<i>And it was, like, half sticking out.</i>

1583
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,226
<i>It was, like, kind of obvious.</i>

1584
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,566
<i>And I immediately was like, "my god."</i>

1585
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:49,590
<i>And I look over and sol
is staring at my platter.</i>

1586
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:51,466
<i>And I thought you saw it.</i>

1587
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,806
- Because...
- I'm just a big burger fan.

1588
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:54,946
I know. And so, I...

1589
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:57,086
Like, at one point, he was just
like, "can I smell your burger?"

1590
01:15:57,110 --> 01:16:00,140
And I was like, "okay, he
was staring at the burger."

1591
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,280
And I, like, covered it
up. It was harrowing.

1592
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:06,280
Andy, I want to go
back to the first episode.

1593
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,946
- Yes.
- Day three.

1594
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:10,140
- Yes.
- One of the worst starts

1595
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:10,644
yes.

1596
01:16:10,668 --> 01:16:13,876
For any player in the history of survivor.

1597
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,140
Und-undoubtedly.

1598
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,466
So, Andy, give
everybody else the update.

1599
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,946
I was overheated. I-I'm okay now.

1600
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:21,396
- Okay. All right.
- I'm okay now. I'm cooled down.

1601
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,256
- All right. You feel all right?
- Yeah.

1602
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,900
Okay. You seem emotional.

1603
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:27,830
Yeah. I was fighting for my life.

1604
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:30,590
I'm on the bottom.

1605
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,900
I see it in their eyes when...

1606
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,590
They don't... I crack open a coconut

1607
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,016
and they didn't cheer for me.

1608
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,760
They cheered for Jon and they...

1609
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:40,590
And then I... I... They don't like me.

1610
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,760
But I don't want to
talk about the bad part.

1611
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:46,566
- Yeah.
- I want to talk about the recovery,

1612
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,876
because anybody watching this season,

1613
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,496
when they saw that
happen at the challenge,

1614
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,806
they said, "he's done, no chance."

1615
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:59,450
I... just felt the enormity
of this opportunity

1616
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,776
in terms of not the game but my life.

1617
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,636
And it was, "hey, like, if you" stay down

1618
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,116
"and if you give up, like,

1619
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,396
could you even survive that?"

1620
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,876
And so, every single breath I take

1621
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,280
until that torch is
snuffed should be to find

1622
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:17,946
the will to survive.

1623
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:22,116
And I found this resiliency

1624
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:25,256
that I could never have imagined.

1625
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,426
And it's completely

1626
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:30,086
orthogonal to what I
expected to happen, and

1627
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,326
are we all listening to his word choice

1628
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,016
- and wondering what they mean?
- Yeah.

1629
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,496
- Orthogonal.
- Orthogonal? - Orthogonal.

1630
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,830
- Orthogonal. - Orthogonal.
- The linguistic...

1631
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:39,830
It's a right angle. It's not...

1632
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:41,450
- An-anyway...
- Of course!

1633
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,946
Sam, it's a right angle. Hello?

1634
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:45,590
- I know.
- My bad. -My bad.

1635
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,800
- Cheers to Andy. Well done.
- Thank you.

1636
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,736
He turned the worst start

1637
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,086
in survivor history into - yeah.

1638
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:53,970
- A life-changing moment.
- Yes. Yes.

1639
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,186
On that note, quick break.
More after show right after this.

1640
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,426
Where'd my bottle go?

1641
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:01,760
<i>Up next... I was born the
year survivor came out.</i>

1642
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:03,636
You really impressed me with how you

1643
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,900
- carried yourself.
- Thank you, Jeff. -Cheers to teeny!

1644
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:10,660
<i>Plus, later, a first look at survivor 48.</i>

1645
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:19,086
Welcome back to the
survivor 47 after show.

1646
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:21,140
Let's talk about blindsides.

1647
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:24,156
They're essential to
the game. We had a lot

1648
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,210
this season. They grew in intensity

1649
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,466
and they grew in their impact.

1650
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:31,736
Genevieve, if there
was an essential quality

1651
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,590
outside of being able to lie

1652
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,900
that allows you to pull
off a blindside, what is it?

1653
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:39,280
You have to prepare,

1654
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:41,806
when you come out to play survivor,

1655
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:44,156
to experience it all. You can

1656
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,806
fantasize about experiencing

1657
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:49,140
only the highs and playing from the top.

1658
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,496
But, like, raise your hand

1659
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,250
if you played from the top the entire time.

1660
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:58,946
No one. So, be prepared
to be on the bottom.

1661
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,226
Caroline, anything
you would add to that?

1662
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,566
I think another one is
being socially aware.

1663
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:06,760
What I personally found to
be really helpful with blindsides

1664
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,566
is thinking through what is best

1665
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:10,426
for each person's game?

1666
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,466
When is it that a blindside right now

1667
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,806
is gonna be beneficial for
this person and this person

1668
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:17,156
and this person? And that
is when they want to strike.

1669
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,776
Gabe, did you struggle at all

1670
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,760
with the emotional part

1671
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:25,086
and if you didn't, is that
because you turned it off

1672
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:26,830
or you just don't struggle?

1673
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:31,016
I don't think I struggle
with the emotional part

1674
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,900
so much. I-I mean, look, I-I was able

1675
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:38,280
to come into this game and
say, like, "it's just a game."

1676
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,590
"I'm coming out here to
win the title of sole survivor

1677
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,776
and to make a million dollars."

1678
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,116
So, I knew that I was
gonna break some eggs

1679
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,210
making an omelet. And
that's what you got to

1680
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,806
be prepared to do if you're gonna

1681
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:50,970
be a good chef on survivor, right?

1682
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,520
Teeny, you grew up watching this show.

1683
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,326
Now you're out here playing this show.

1684
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:59,396
What would you say to
somebody who's never gonna play,

1685
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,156
"here's what you need to
know in order to understand

1686
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,186
why this game is so difficult"?

1687
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:05,140
You know, being
somebody who... I was born

1688
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:07,590
the year survivor came
out. Sorry to age anybody.

1689
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:11,426
- Wow.
- But... yeah. I mean, like, I've grown up

1690
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:15,086
with this show. And
you have to realize that

1691
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:18,466
we're all, at our core,
obsessed with survivor.

1692
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:20,156
And so when you come out here,

1693
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,736
you start at the baseline of

1694
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,900
we put so much sacrifice into this,

1695
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:25,496
we put so much work into this

1696
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,280
and we put so much love

1697
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:29,970
and pressure on
ourselves because of this.

1698
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,156
So, every single round of the game

1699
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,156
is life or death.

1700
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:37,116
So, to have to

1701
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:40,736
overcome that and make hard
decisions while you're starving,

1702
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,116
while you're stressed out,

1703
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:44,426
while you're unsure of who's lying to you

1704
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:47,280
it is almost frustrating.

1705
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:49,946
Because I know that nobody

1706
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:52,900
that I ever explain this to will fully grasp

1707
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:56,086
what it is that we've had to do out here.

1708
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:59,466
And I hope that I was able
to articulate that well enough.

1709
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:01,900
Teeny, I just want to
say, as you mentioned,

1710
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,636
you were born, basically,
when survivor started.

1711
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,140
Really impressive

1712
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:09,086
to see a young person come out here

1713
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:11,280
and play a game with
people... some of which

1714
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:14,156
are quite a bit older and
have more life experience,

1715
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:17,280
and the young person
never thinks that's a deficit.

1716
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:19,396
But, being around here for a while,

1717
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:20,946
it is. Life experience matters.

1718
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:23,566
You really impressed me
with how you carried yourself.

1719
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:25,470
So, I hope you're proud
of the game you played.

1720
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,000
- Thank you, Jeff.
- Cheers to teeny!

1721
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,016
Thank you. I really appreciate that.

1722
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,676
- Teeny chill, teeny chill.
- Teeny, cheers.

1723
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,970
Okay, now we have to turn the corner.

1724
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,086
Wait, wait.

1725
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:41,210
Can you hear it? It's calling.

1726
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:45,110
<i>Survivor 48. Your first
look - when we come back.</i>

1727
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,296
All right, I want to say
thank you to all of you,

1728
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,156
and I mean it. And to all
the non-jury who couldn't

1729
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:57,736
be here tonight, we love our jobs

1730
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,450
on survivor, we've loved
having you on the show,

1731
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,396
but every season has to come to an end.

1732
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:04,900
We've been very lucky for a long time

1733
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:07,256
to say there's another one, and there is.

1734
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,080
Here's your first look at survivor 48.

1735
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:20,830
Survivor has been
calling me <i>for a long time.</i>

1736
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,180
<i>I just wasn't listening.</i>

1737
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:27,590
<i>I can feel it.</i>

1738
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,280
<i>When people see me, they assume</i>

1739
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,590
<i>that I'm going to be
reading their tarot cards.</i>

1740
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:38,156
<i>But I've led
hundred-million-dollar projects</i>

1741
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,776
for my company.

1742
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,016
<i>My parents would always say,</i>

1743
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,086
<i>"you're gonna be the
first one sent home." Like,</i>

1744
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:45,296
they came up with the reasons as to why

1745
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,776
I would just be, like, the first boot.

1746
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,970
<i>I'm too weak. I'm not friendly enough.</i>

1747
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,210
Like, I'm weird.

1748
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,016
<i>I feel like Jeff was talking
to me when he said,</i>

1749
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,706
"come on, apply now!"

1750
01:22:55,730 --> 01:22:57,210
<i>He was talking to me. I don't know</i>

1751
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,676
<i>if y'all thought he was talking to y'all,</i>

1752
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,970
but he was talking to me.

1753
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,706
<i>I think this is my time to
have confidence in myself</i>

1754
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,290
<i>that I can do this. I'm physically fit,</i>

1755
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,970
<i>I'm mentally fit, I'm always</i>

1756
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,636
whoa! Is that a fly? Okay.

1757
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:14,396
- Go!
- Let's go!

1758
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:16,736
<i>These 18 strangers</i>

1759
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,426
<i>have answered the call for
the adventure of a lifetime.</i>

1760
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,776
<i>I know how to play with people.</i>

1761
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,326
<i>That is my superpower.</i>

1762
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:25,396
<i>If Mozart's superpower was the piano,</i>

1763
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:26,700
my superpower is people.

1764
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:30,326
<i>They must learn to adapt
or they'll be voted out.</i>

1765
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:32,450
<i>You want to know why
I have muscles? I drink</i>

1766
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,566
so much chocolate milk.

1767
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:36,156
<i>It has the perfect protein-to-carb ratio.</i>

1768
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,296
That's all-that's all chocolate milk, right?

1769
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,320
That's right there.

1770
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:41,566
<i>In the end, only one will remain to claim</i>

1771
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:43,636
<i>the million-dollar prize.</i>

1772
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,396
<i>I am on the autism spectrum.</i>

1773
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,450
<i>But I've always looked
at my autism as a gift.</i>

1774
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,566
<i>Being a physicist, being an engineer,</i>

1775
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:50,970
<i>playing men's hockey</i>

1776
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,520
this does not scare me at all.

1777
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:55,080
Stop! Medical.

1778
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:58,946
This is a historic moment.

1779
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:01,116
<i>Being a single dad, I'm out here</i>

1780
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:04,140
<i>to walk away knowing
that when my kids watch this</i>

1781
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,610
<i>I want them to look at me and say,</i>

1782
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:06,700
"I'm proud of him."

1783
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,630
<i>I like it!</i>

1784
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,426
All right, well, that's it.

1785
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:20,496
If you want to bid on
props from this season,

1786
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,140
you can do so.

1787
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:25,760
Proceeds benefit stand up to cancer.

1788
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:29,466
And if you want to be on
survivor, you got to apply.

1789
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:31,736
We'll see you in the
spring for survivor 48.

1790
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,760
All right.

1791
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:35,736
Now we're really celebrating.

1792
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,016
Let's get over here and sign.

1793
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,706
- Anywhere? Anywhere?
- Anywhere you want.

1794
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:43,156
Everybody's got to sign the logo.

1795
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,636
I got pens.

1796
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:49,350
Rachel, the winner of survivor 47.
