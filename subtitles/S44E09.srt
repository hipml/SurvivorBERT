DANNY: Just got back

3
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:17,241
contrary to what usually happens
in this game, everything went

4
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:18,758
exactly to plan.

5
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:20,655
All the votes went on Frannie.

6
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:22,068
I played the idol for her.

7
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,275

That's three. That's enough.

you know,
it's on everybody'sSurvivor

00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:38,172
bucket list,
and for it to go as planned...

14
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:39,724
It's a good feeling.

15
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:42,275
Was that not the most

- Oh, my God.

17

DANNY: Everybody was
afraid of the former Ratu tribe

18
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:50,344
just bulldozering
their way through, so,

19
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:52,551
the game plan was
to weaken Ratu.

20
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:54,302
Just wanted to even everything
out, you know, so...

21
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,724
And now it's three Tika,

22
00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:59,448
three Soka,
three, uh... three Ratu.

We're all
on an even playing field,

24
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:03,724
so it worked perfectly.

25
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:07,034
Deep in my soul, I kept saying,
"We need to split the vote.

26
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:09,577
- We need to split the vote," and we did not.
- DANNY: I know.

It is not a great feeling

33
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:23,000
to have to lose one
of our Ratu members.

I still feel like
I'm in the majority.

We have the members of Ratu,
in addition to

42
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,551
the Tika members, so hopefully

43
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:47,275
those bonds can stay strong

44

Ratu still thinks
I'm working with them

'cause I voted
with them against Frannie.

But in reality, I knew all along

51
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,061
Danny was going
to play the idol to protect her.

52
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:12,862
So, big target goes out,
no blood in my hands.

KANE: To be honest,

69
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,406
as soon as Brandon was removed
from this game,

70
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:10,482
I wasn't, like, heartbroken.
I wasn't betrayed.

71
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:12,275
I was woken up.

72
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:18,689
The idea is that there
are idols back on this beach.

73
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:22,103
So I put my business pants on,
and I'm going to work now.

74
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:28,793
In Dungeons & Dragons,
everybody plays on the same side

75
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,620
against a common enemy.

76
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:33,586
So, the common enemy in Survivor
is the big threat.

77
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,586
And Danny is growing
into a big threat.

78
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:38,137

79
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:39,406
to keep trying
to make these big moves

80
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:41,275
and keep his foot on the gas

81
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,137
until somebody rips him
out of the car.

82
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,724
DANNY: I could have let
Frannie go and kept the idol

83
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:49,413
and played a defensive game,
but this game is not won

84
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,067

85
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,061
You got to go outside
your comfort zone. I'm really

86
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:54,958
uncomfortable now...
I don't have my idol anymore.

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,758
And I guarantee
making such a big move

88
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,620
put a target on my back,

89
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:00,124

DANNY: Finding an idol...

111
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:14,344
It's a game of chance,
but this is one

112
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,034
of those games of chance
that you can

of my story,
and it-it no longer is something

175
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,034
that I'm ashamed of.

176
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:11,551
It's just a part of me
and made me who I am today.

177
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:16,241
The preoccupation that, like,
comes with, like, okay,

178
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:17,724
"Well, I-I...
well, I got to have

179
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,747
- "my drink first, or I got to..."
- JAIME: Yeah.

180
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:23,068
Oh, there's so much involved
in that

181
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:25,862
that is so exhausting.
I messed up.

182
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:28,413
I made a lot of mistakes,
but it's like

183
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:31,034
that wasn't me, but
I didn't know, like, who I was.

184
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:34,068
And so getting sober
and going to treatment...

185
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:36,000
I started to like my life.

186
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:38,895
Then I met my fiancé in...
at an AA meeting.

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,578
- And...
- Someone who's also recovering.

188
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,931
Yeah, and it's literally been
like, poof ever since.

189
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,827
[crying]: Yeah,
I'm proud as hell of myself.

190
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,379
I never thought I would have,
you know, a family

191
00:08:48,482 --> 00:08:51,758
and this wonderful son
and, like...

192
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:54,758
everything. I look at my house,
and I decorate for Halloween...

193
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,275
[sniffles]
and it looks creepy as ...,

194
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,206
but it's everything
that I wanted.

195
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,931
It's like... [sniffles]

196
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:04,206
...I have everything
that I need.

197
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,068
What, like, we're both grateful
for is that, like,

198
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,103
our son never has to see, like,

199
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:10,655
- us addicted.
- HEIDI: Yeah.

200
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,440
CAROLYN: Like, he sees
the recovery side of things.

201
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,620
- And, like, I can get up on a Sunday.
- HEIDI: Yes.

202
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:16,137
CAROLYN: We can go to church.

203
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:19,034
We can do whatever, and it's
like we're not struggling

204
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:21,379
to get up and get out of bed.

205
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:25,103
We feel better,
and I can just be present.

206
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:28,689
FRANNIE: I love
Carolyn. She's so herself.

207
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:31,137
She's the kind of person
that I want to be around

208
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,268
because that's something
that I'm trying to work on.

209
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,689
Right? Being more myself
and being okay

210
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:37,517
being, like, weird or out there.

211
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,310
And looking at Carolyn,
I'm like,

212
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,482
"Man, I can learn a lot
from her."

213
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:43,551
Who here has felt like
the weird kid before?

214
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:45,655
- Yeah. - I think all of us.
- All of us.

215
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:47,448
Doesn't matter
where you come from.

216
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,509
Doesn't matter, like,
how cute you are with makeup.

217
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:51,448
- Right.
- Like, we all had those moments.

218
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:54,655
It's crazy how each day
I'm getting my footing more.

219
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:56,965
When I came here, they all said,

220
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,827
"I don't know
if we can work with her."

221
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,620
How are my teeth?

222
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:05,413
CAROLYN: And so now
people aren't suspecting anything.

223
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,482
They think I'm confused.

224
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:09,241
Itches. Itches.
I can't. I can't.

225
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:11,172
- [Frannie laughs]
- I got to put this down.

226
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,586
I've had to work past that,
like, insecurity,

227
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:15,000
and I'm not caring so much

228
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:18,310
about, like,
how people look at me or how...

229
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:20,103
'cause I can't control that.

230
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:23,655
And part of it, too, like,
I want people to think

231
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,199
that I really don't know
what I'm doing.

232
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:28,655
Am I having fun? Of course I am.

233
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,158
- That's scary.
- [Frannie whooping]

234
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:31,586
CAROLYN: But I want them

235
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:34,068
to think that
I would rather be having fun

236
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:35,931
than actually strategizing.

237
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,000
But I'm here to play,

238
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:40,551
and I don't care. I'm not
holding anything back. I'm not.

239
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:42,379
I promised my son I wouldn't.

240
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,241
[birds singing]

241
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:01,758
CARSON:
This morning, when I woke up,

242
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,620
I felt more tired than I was
when I went to bed last night.

243
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:08,344
I mean, the last couple of days
in terms of how I'm feeling

244
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,896
have been a roller coaster, but

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,320
at least I don't feel like
I'm gonna throw up all the time.

246
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,689
- Are you feeling okay?
- CARSON: Oh, yeah, like,

247
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:18,413
I think, like,
my stomach doesn't hurt at all

248
00:11:18,517 --> 00:11:22,448
right now, but, like,
my energy levels are so low.

249
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,862
CAROLYN: Oh, yum.

250
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:25,130
- Carson?
- HEIDI: Have you had BM?

251
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:26,544
CAROLYN:
You want, like, the last sip?

252
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,440
FRANNIE: Yeah, the
coconut water, I feel like, has,

253
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,310
like, electrolytes and sugars.

254
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:32,310
CARSON: We are really hungry.

255
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:34,344
I know, for myself,
I haven't eaten

256
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:38,379
in literally days, and so I have

257
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:39,620
nothing in my body.

258
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:40,923
Should we try
to get 'em crispier?

259
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:42,275
- Ooh, yeah.
- Yeah, way thinner

260
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,544
so we can't
even taste what this is

261
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:44,716
- 'cause I'm sick of it.
- Yeah.

262
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:45,965
CARSON: We just kind of find

263
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:48,137
unripe papaya and, like,

264
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,793
cook it and just

265
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,448
char it. It's pretty gross.

266
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:53,448
And we don't have
that many coconuts.

267
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,310
So we're really
literally starving.

268
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,758
But I signed up for this, I knew

269
00:11:57,862 --> 00:11:59,344
I was going to be miserable.

270
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:02,068
It is what it is. It's Survivor.

271
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:04,413
[singsongy]:
We've got tree mail!

272
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:05,751
- [whooping]
- LAUREN: All right.

273
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:06,958
- CAROLYN: Awesome.
- LAUREN: Va-va-voom.

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,827
- HEIDI: Ready?
- CARSON: All right.

275
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,275
[Heidi sighs]

276
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,310
"This challenge
is relatively painless

277
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:15,448
unless you're craving rice..." Oh, gosh.
- HEIDI: Oh.

278
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,827
CARSON: "...because
you will feel the sting

279
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:20,758
when you negotiate the price."

280
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:22,758
LAUREN: This morning
the tree mail mentioned

281
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:25,344
that we can negotiate for rice.

282
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:26,724
So,

283
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:30,034
as we've seen
in past Survivorseasons,

284
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:32,413
we have to have enough people

285
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:33,827
willing to give up their shot

286
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:36,172
at winning immunity
to get that rice.

287
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:39,551
YAM YAM: Do we have
people that want to sit out?

288
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:44,137
I haven't even really been able
to compete in an immunity,

289
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,862
- so I want to.
- HEIDI: Yeah.

290
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,241
But I'm also really hungry.

291
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:49,000
If I see it and I'm like,

292
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,578
"I don't think
I'm gonna be good at that,"

293
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,992
- I'm fine with, like...
- HEIDI: Yeah, we can check it

294
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,620
after we see it just to see.

295
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,896
DANNY: There's some
nonsense idea out there

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,206
that people are going to not do
an immunity challenge for rice.

297
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,751
It's embarrassing
every time I hear it.

298
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,647
I don't even want
to be standing there with them

299
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:04,992
when it's brought up 'cause we
came out here to playSurvivor.

300
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,862
You can go 30 days
without eating.

301
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,302
- CARSON: And I'll see the challenge. It's...
- I'm hungry,

302
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:10,068
- but I'm not sitting out.
- KANE: Yeah.

303
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:11,889
DANNY: Let's call a
spade a spade right now.

304
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,310
We're three, three and three.

305
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:14,620
- Yeah.
- DANNY: Everybody's

306
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:17,241
relatively even,
so let's just play the game.

307
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:19,379
FRANNIE: At this point,
there's three members

308
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,586
of each of the original
three tribes.

309
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,724
And Tika has kind of

310
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:26,241
been floating in the middle,
it feels.

311
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:28,482
Because of that,
I don't know for sure

312
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:31,206
that Tika is with us,
so that's not a sacrifice

313
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,034
that I'm willing to make.

314
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:34,475
DANNY:
Let's be the season that says,

315
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:35,896
- "We're players."
- CAROLYN: Yeah.

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,310
Let's-let's be that season.

317
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:39,758
- So...
- FRANNIE: Yeah.

318
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:42,034
CARSON:
People on this tribe are so

319
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:44,793
gung ho
about not giving up their spot.

320
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:47,482
So we'll see what will happen,
but, like,

321
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:50,413
I'm hungry. [Laughs]

immunity is back up for grabs.

going to stand on a small block

while balancing a ball
on an overhanging piece of wood.

336

If at any point, the ball drops,

you're out.

341
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,241
will be the tenth person
voted out

342
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:05,172
and the third member
of our jury.

343
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,620
All right, so this morning
you got tree mail

344
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:10,034
telling you, you would have
the opportunity

345
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:12,172
to sit out of this challenge
and give up

346
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:16,137
your shot at immunity in
exchange for rice for the tribe.

347
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:17,620
Have you discussed this?

348
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:19,758
Are you interested
in negotiating for rice?

349
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:23,000
We have discussed it,
but I would love to hear now,

350
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:25,793
you know, due to the conditions
and everything,

351
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:28,827
to see if anyone have changed
their mind.

352
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:34,172
I'll sit out
if anybody else wants to.

353
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:36,793
- I'll sit out. I'll sit out.
- So there's two people.

354
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,413
- Anybody else?
- Please.

355
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:41,613
- LAUREN: Anybody else?
- PROBST: So, we got Carson and Lauren.

356
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:45,034
I want four. Four people's the
number. You're halfway there.

357
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,310
Kane, let's talk about this
because the idea

358
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:52,620
of this negotiation
is really simple.

359
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:55,586
Will people give up the most
important thing in the game,

360
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,275
your shot at immunity,

361
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,724
in order for the tribe
to have rice?

362
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,310
Because the easy thing is
to say,

363
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,241
"We won't vote the four
of you out."

364
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:05,137
Yeah, it's about the balance.

365
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,206
It's about the balance
of reliance

366
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,758
and competition, and I think
that if the vote had gone

367
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:11,758
how I thought
it would have at last Tribal,

368
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:13,896
I would have been more willing
to step forward.

369
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,724
But I'm not certain
that four people will be.

370
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:19,344
I-I won't vote for the sit-outs.

371
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:20,620
You will not?

372
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:23,137
- Sure.
- PROBST: Okay.

373
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:25,337
I won't either. I mean,
I'm a part of that, but I won't.

374
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,931
I won't.

375
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,241
Okay, so Danny's saying,
"I won't vote if you sit out."

376
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:33,034
- Carolyn, did you just say that?
- Me, I won't.

377
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:35,482
Yeah, scout's honor.

378
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:38,758
I'll make three.

379
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,337
- Kane's at three.
- CAROLYN: So we're just one person.

380
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:41,689
PROBST: We're one person away.

381
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:49,413
Nobody else?

382
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:51,758
PROBST: Well, the rain is not
going to let up,

383
00:16:51,862 --> 00:16:53,268
so we might as well get on
to this challenge

384
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,710
so you can get back
to your shelter.

385
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:57,344
And aren't you glad
you have that tarp?

386
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:58,889
- All right...
- Are you thinking about it?

387
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,931
- What?
- Wait.

388
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,862
- Please.
- Are you doing it, Jaime?

389
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:09,827
Don't do it
if you're hesitating. Play.

390
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:15,034
It's just too...
it's-it's too much to risk

391
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:17,068
right now in the game.

392
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:18,758
- Should I do it?
- You want to sit out?

393
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:20,586
I'll do it. I'll do the fourth.

394
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,448
Okay. So we have Carson, Heidi,

395
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,655
Kane and Lauren. Wow.

396
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,655
I never saw that negotiation
coming to a close like this.

397
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,586
Sit-outs, take a spot over here.

398
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:35,620
Let's take a look
at those willing to sacrifice.

399
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:37,103
For the community,

400
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:40,482
almost half the tribe is gonna
give up their shot

401
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:44,344
at certainty tonight in exchange
for a large bag of rice will...

402
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:45,854
- Give it your all.
- ...be waiting for you

403
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:48,310
back at camp, nice and dry.

404
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:51,344
We'll draw for spots.
We'll get started. Here we go.

405
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:00,827
All right,
everybody take your spots.

406
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:02,965
You can only have one foot
on that block,

407
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:07,310
which means your second foot
will be on top of your first.

408
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:09,103
Get ahold of the handles.

409
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:13,758
Wedge that ball up there,
and we will go.

410
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:20,758
All right, everybody looks good.

411
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,862
This challenge is on.

412
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:30,689
Five people competing,
four sat out for rice.

413
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:32,827
It's Frannie, Jaime,

Yam Yam, Danny and Carolyn.

415
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:37,413
This is already

416
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,379
- a very difficult challenge...
- Oh, my God.

417
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:41,620
...to do when it's dry,

418
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:46,172
let alone with the rain
making that ball wet.

419
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:50,689
Oh, my God.

420
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:52,689
You're balancing
on a small block,

421
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:56,068
knowing you can't let that
second foot touch the block,

422
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:57,827
- or you're out.
- Oh, my God.

423
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:59,896
PROBST:
There'll be no grace period.

424
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,103
Carolyn trying to hang in there.

425
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:04,172

on the block is tough.

00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:08,275

- PROBST: She would not sit out.
- CAROLYN: I tried.

431
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:18,344
Jaime is out. We're down
to three just like that.

You're doing a great job.
This is a difficult challenge.

You saw how fast it can be over.

437
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,931

I'm the weakest woman here."

To now go up against some
of the biggest guys in this game

505

00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:25,103
- Yeah! - Yeah!
- [whooping]

512
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:32,103
LAUREN: At the challenge,
four of us sat out for rice.

513
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:35,689
It was super risky, but I was
like, I don't care. Like,

514
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:38,862
I finally get to eat rice,
and it

515
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,758
is amazing.

516
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:42,222
FRANNIE:
Oh, it's gonna be so good!

517
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,896
- YAM YAM: Oh, my God.
- FRANNIE: Oh, my God.

518
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,379
JAIME: This is like a feast.

519
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:49,310
- CAROLYN: Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

520
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:50,820
KANE: But I don't think
I would have won that challenge,

521
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,448
so it made sense to sit out.

522
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:55,379
And the good news is

523
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:57,793
the people who stepped out
will not be voted out tonight.

524
00:23:57,896 --> 00:23:59,379
[laughs] Yeah, right.

525
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:01,655
Danny giving me scout's honor

526
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:03,344
that he's not going
to vote for me

527
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:07,137
when he completely blindsided
my plan at last Tribal Council.

528
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:11,068
So, I mean, these people's word
means literally nothing to me.

529
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:14,172
JAIME: I'm so grateful.
Thank you guys so much.

530
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:16,482
YAM YAM: Eating rice woke
me up. Like, now I'm, like...

531
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,103
I'm ready to play.

532
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,965
But that's the dangerous thing.
Everybody's like that now.

533
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:25,034
Fortunately, there's a war
between Ratu and Soka,

534
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:27,379
and I'm in the middle
with Carson and Carolyn.

535
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:31,758
I mean, I don't care. I...

536
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:34,896
I think that we-we have
the majority right here, right?

537
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
HEIDI:
As soon as we came back to camp,

538
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:40,172
the Tika members were wanting
to work with us.

539
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:42,413
And I'm like, "Thank you,"
'cause Ratu...

540
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:45,931
We just got one of their
big guys... Brandon... out.

541
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:47,482
So they're not going
to trust me.

542
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,275
So we have a better chance
with Tika.

543
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,448
CARSON: Well, I'm...

544
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:01,551
Kane is extremely smart.
He is a gamer.

545
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:04,551
He's a big guy, so he could do
challenges very well.

546
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:07,724
So I think it's a good idea
to send Kane home today.

547
00:25:07,827 --> 00:25:09,413
I don't plan to play my idol.

548
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:12,620
However, I'm bringing it
because I'm ready for anything.

549
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:14,793
Are you okay with that?

550
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:18,862
But we, for sure, need
to get Jaime

551
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:21,517
- to flush the idol.
- YAM YAM: Yes. - Yes.

552
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,751
CARSON: Because Soka and
Ratu are both targeting each other,

553
00:25:23,793 --> 00:25:25,620
it leaves Tika in the middle.

554
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,586
So it all comes down

555
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:29,034
to Carolyn, Yam Yam and I,

556
00:25:29,137 --> 00:25:30,379
and we just have to decide

557
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:31,862
who to work with.

558
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,758
But regardless,
we want to flush Jaime's idol.

559
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,137
Hello, Jaime.

560
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,137
- No. No.
- CARSON: But they...

561
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,724
- They-they are.
- Oh, okay.

562
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:47,448
- We're just trying to circumvent that, so...
- Okay.

563
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:50,068
- JAIME: We need to break up Soka, then.
- CARSON: Soka?

564
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:51,337
JAIME: They're
gonna take it to the end.

565
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:52,539
They're all physical threats.

566
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,517
So we have to split

567
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,586
between... Danny

568
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,172
- and Heidi, then.
- CARSON: Yeah.

569
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,310
LAUREN: I am extremely happy

570
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:03,653
that Danny didn't win immunity.

571
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:05,137
I want Danny

572
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:06,689
out of this game.

573
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:08,379
Danny got Brandon out.

574
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:11,034
He's a strong physical player,

575
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,931
so he needs to go.

576
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:15,103
But Danny may have found
another idol,

577
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,758
and the lesson learned
from the last.

578
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:20,965
Tribal Council is,
we should have split the vote.

579
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:24,862
Yeah.

580
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,793
Mm-hmm.

581
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:33,862
KANE: If... Yeah.

582
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:35,137
- Okay.
- Good?

583
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,689
JAIME: Worst-case scenario...

584
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:39,068
We get Heidi out, but I am

585
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:41,517
very fearful
that my name is out there.

586
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,371
I do have an idol,
which I've tried to suppress

587
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:45,000
as much as possible,

588
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,655
but at this point
everyone knows everything.

589
00:26:50,172 --> 00:26:52,172
Okay.

590
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:54,241
Knowledge Is Power.
Yeah, that's a good idea.

591
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:57,034
I'm quite confident
that we have Tika with us,

592
00:26:57,137 --> 00:27:00,482
but the one thing that could go
wrong is the Knowledge Is Power.

593
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,026
We don't even know
if it's in this game,

594
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:04,068
but people are scared
of Knowledge Is Power

595
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:07,206
because at the Tribal Council,
it allows a player

596
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,965
to steal an idol or an advantage
if they know who has it.

597
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:17,931
JAIME: Okay.

598
00:27:20,793 --> 00:27:22,137
KANE: Yeah, that works.

599
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,241
So, Jaime's going
to give me her idol.

600
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:25,586
So, that is good news

601
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:26,862
'cause if Jaime goes home,

602
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:28,896
then that's my idol now.

603
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,137
So, we'll trade these back
sometime after.

604
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:33,206
Yeah. Yep. Excellent.

605
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,241
So this is the debut of
Kane Fritzler, the strategist,

606
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,517
because I have not voted someone
off this island yet.

607
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,020
And if I want
to win this damn game,

608
00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:44,172
I got
to start voting people out.

609
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:52,137
FRANNIE:
At this point, it's become clear

610
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:53,613
that the three Tika members
are kind of

611
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,275
floating in the middle, and

612
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:58,000
if we don't do something about
it, at the end of the day,

613
00:27:58,103 --> 00:27:59,482
Tika's going to be left,

614
00:27:59,586 --> 00:28:00,820
and we'll be on the jury bench.

615
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:03,448
So, even though we know

616
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,034
that the old Ratu members

617
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:06,793
have idols and advantages,

618
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:09,482
rather than trying to vote them
out, we need to work with them.

619
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:16,206
- DANNY: Yeah.
- FRANNIE: So let's do this.

620
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:29,655
DANNY: Frannie wants to get
rid of Yam Yam and Carolyn.

621
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,854
Frannie, I love you, but you got
to play the game smart.

622
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:33,448
Working with Ratu...

623
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:35,164
I mean, that's sleeping under
the wing of a dragon right now

624
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:36,689
with two advantages.

625
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:38,379
It's not good gameplay.

626
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:40,034
Tika has no threats right now.

627
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:43,448
Ratu has an extra vote advantage
and-and an idol.

628
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:45,586
Just...

629
00:28:47,931 --> 00:28:49,689
To me, feels like Frannie's

630
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:51,862
taking sides against the family.

631
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,793
CARSON: We got to think,

632
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:58,448
what is the best move
for the three of us here?

633
00:28:58,551 --> 00:28:59,724
In my mind...

634
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,758
YAM YAM: Since the merge,

635
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:08,241
Josh, Matt,
Brandon voted for me,

636
00:29:08,344 --> 00:29:10,275
and they're sitting
at the jury now.

637
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:12,620
You write my name down,
you're dead.

638
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:15,413
And the other person that
wrote my name down was Kane.

639
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:18,758
So I want to work
with Soka to take him out.

640
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:20,896
Let's go through the options.

641
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,793
- So that's why...
- I disagree.

642
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:32,586
- Like, what...?
- I think he is.

643
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,724
I'm trying to think, like, well,
what is the best, like, for me?

644
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:41,275
Yam Yam wants Kane out.
"Kane's this big threat."

645
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,586
I don't see it.
'Cause he's sneaky?

646
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:45,896
We're all sneaky.
It's so stupid.

647
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,862
I want to vote out Danny.

648
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:50,137
I have ever since
the muscle bro thing.

649
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:53,482
I'm sick of him. That's why
I'm voting him out, okay?

650
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:58,931
I just feel, we have the numbers

651
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:00,517
to legitimately get Danny.

652
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,275
Yeah, we do.
That's what I'm saying.

653
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:05,099
- If you... if that's not what you were thinking...
- So it's like...

654
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:09,310
CARSON:
Yam Yam wants to take out Kane,

655
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:11,965
but Carolyn really wants
to work with Ratu

656
00:30:12,068 --> 00:30:13,724
and take out Danny.

657
00:30:13,827 --> 00:30:17,344
So we have to make a decision,
and by being in the middle,

658
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,206
Tika has a lot of power, and

659
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,862
as long as I can keep the old.

660
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:23,172
Tika members together
to vote as a collective group,

661
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:26,034
we pretty much control
this vote.

662
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:29,551
Well, that's why
we have each other, so...

663
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:35,068
That's what I'm...
That's what I have been doing.

664
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:36,958
CARSON: The Three
Stooges are running this game.

665
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,586
It's crazy. So,

666
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:40,586
there's a lot
of different names on the table,

667
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:43,448
and we just have to decide
who we want to go home.

668
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
♪ ♪

669
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:21,517
PROBST: All right, let's
start with the challenge.

670
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,586
Frannie pulls out
her second individual

671
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:25,655
immunity win. Congratulations.

672
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,965
Heidi, the other big event
at the challenge was,

673
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:30,344
we had our rice negotiation.

674
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:32,310
We end up with four people...
You,

675
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:34,793
Lauren, Carson
and Kane all agree

676
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:36,827
to sit out of the challenge.

677
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:38,233
Still feel okay
with your decision

678
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:39,689
after being at camp all day?

679
00:31:39,793 --> 00:31:41,413
HEIDI:
In all honesty, it was like

680
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:43,758
a last-second decision
fr-from me.

681
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:46,413
I'm a competitor.
I wanted to compete, too.

682
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:48,241
But I don't regret it.

683
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:50,827
I'm moving forward. Hopefully,
I don't go home today.

684
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:52,854
PROBST: Kane, one of the
things that was talked about

685
00:31:52,896 --> 00:31:54,862
at the challenge was this idea

686
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:57,137
that four people volunteer

687
00:31:57,241 --> 00:32:00,000
and everybody else says,
"For tonight you're safe."

688
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:01,896
KANE:
Yeah, I don't believe that.

689
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,689
Um, you know, everybody gives

690
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:06,448
different levels of trust and
different levels of their word,

691
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:10,034
but there's all kinds of bonds
that get broken in this game.

692
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,724
I feel like rice negotiation
is low on the totem pole,

693
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:15,551
given all of the type of trust
that has been broken

694
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:16,931
in the history of Survivor.

695
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,310
I did hear Danny say
"Scout's honor."

696
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:21,172
Yeah, I'm not a scout, Jeff.

697
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,241
[laughter]

698
00:32:22,344 --> 00:32:23,655
Wow.

699
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:25,068
DANNY: So, I hear a lot of this,

700
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:27,206
"Oh, you know, well,
it was for the tribe."

701
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,337
So, it's not for the tribe. It's
for yourself. You're hungry.

702
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:31,034
"Oh, I just wanted my people
to eat."

703
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:33,103
Okay, you can't eat,
the other eight can.

704
00:32:33,206 --> 00:32:35,310
Will you still sit out?
You'll get, "No."

705
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,164
KANE: I don't know if I
agree with that completely.

706
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,896
For me, it was just
risk assessment.

707
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,310
I saw that challenge,

708
00:32:40,413 --> 00:32:41,889
and I did not think
it was going to happen.

709
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:43,620
The second best thing
I can do for myself

710
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:46,000
is get rice, and if other people
were willing to do it,

711
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:47,440
I was going
to take that step forward.

712
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:49,551
PROBST:
Jaime, this is fundamentally

713
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,275
why Survivor'sso interesting.

714
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:53,275
Every season is different

715
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:54,965
because the players
are different,

716
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:58,034
and they decide, "These are the
norms, these are the values."

717
00:32:58,137 --> 00:32:59,862
- Where do you sit in this?
- JAIME: I think

718
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:02,344
you have these
opposite-side-of-the-spectrum

719
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,379
opinions on what it means
to sit out

720
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,137
for the greater good
of the tribe.

721
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:09,000
It tells you a lot
about the individual

722
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:10,724
and how
they're playing the game.

723
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:14,620
Danny?

724
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:18,413
Oh, yeah. I mean,
agree to disagree. [Laughs]

725
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:21,241
[laughter]

726
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:23,068
PROBST:
Carolyn, how about for you?

727
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:24,716
CAROLYN: Jeff, we
weren't even talking about

728
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:28,551
who sat out and who didn't
sit out because that rice

729
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:29,862
changed everything.

730
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:32,448
As soon as we got that rice,
we were...

731
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:35,517
Oh, we were different people,
right?

732
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,310
- We felt human again. Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

733
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:38,896
It changed us.

734
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,551
- Wow.
- And it made us even hungrier.

735
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:43,647
And I can see some of us talking
probably on the way back.

736
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,289
We're going to want rice
on the way home.

737
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:47,586
[laughter]

738
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:51,689
PROBST: So, Yam Yam,
what was the vibe today?

739
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:54,103
Because the rice
lifts everybody's spirits,

740
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:56,620
but it also puts everybody's
brains back together.

741
00:33:56,724 --> 00:33:58,379
So now you can
actually strategize

742
00:33:58,482 --> 00:33:59,931
at your full capacity.

743
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:02,517
YAM YAM:
As soon as that rice was done,

744
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,862
we went back to who we are,
you know?

745
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:07,137
Talking about possibilities.
Who is it? Is it me?

746
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:08,793
I always think it's me,
you know?

747
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,068
So, it-it makes you
a little paranoid.

748
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:15,344
PROBST: Lauren, is it every
player for themselves now,

749
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,793
or are there still tribal groups

750
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:19,344
that are trying
to work together?

751
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:22,862
I think there are still
some bonds that are still there

752
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:25,585
within old tribes,
but I'm still thinking

753
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,896
about my individual game
and thinking about

754
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,931
who has lied to me
and who has not.

755
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:35,310
- Oh, oh, she went, "Lied to me."
- You have lied to me, though.

756
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:37,379
PROBST: Frannie, what is it

757
00:34:37,482 --> 00:34:39,034
about Tribals like this

758
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:41,688
that make everybody
spark so much?

759
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:45,551
That adrenaline burst that says,
"Yes, it could be any of us,

760
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:48,068
"we really don't know,
and yet I can't wait to vote.

761
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:49,474
"I don't even know
who anyone else is voting for.

762
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:51,482
I don't care.
I just want to see."

763
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:53,302
It's-it's... I mean,
it's just like you said.

764
00:34:53,344 --> 00:34:55,613
It's electric, you know? Like,
you walk around with somebody,

765
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,026
and they say,
"I'm gonna do this plan."

766
00:34:57,068 --> 00:34:58,948
And you're like,
"Great, we're doing that plan."

767
00:34:59,034 --> 00:35:00,440
And then
they walk with somebody else.

768
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:02,130
And I'm like, "Was that real?
Which plan is it?"

769
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:03,586
And so, at the end of the day,

770
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:05,448
sometimes
it's just the last plan.

771
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:06,862
HEIDI: Jeff, even if logically,

772
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:08,689
just by numbers,
you think you have it,

773
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:10,620
there may be a Shot in the Dark.

774
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:13,206
We have idols out there.
We have extra votes out there.

775
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,103
So none of us know what's going
to happen tonight until

776
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:19,103
you start reading those votes.

777
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:22,034
PROBST:
Jaime, it hits on the excitement

778
00:35:22,137 --> 00:35:24,379
and the dread of this game,

779
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:27,103
and what makes it so alive is,
"It could be me."

780
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:29,793
JAIME: Yes. I'm listening
to everything because

781
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:31,544
I need to make sure
that the last conversation

782
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:33,724
I had was solid.

783
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:36,275
So I'm trying to pick up
what people are putting down.

784
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:39,172
- YAM YAM: I'm pretty sure everybody has a plan.
- [others assent]

785
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:41,275
It's just, the surprise
is going to be...

786
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:44,655
- Which one are we going...?
- [overlapping chatter]

787
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:46,551
And who's the "it," you know?

788
00:35:46,655 --> 00:35:48,482
- Bye-bye. Hope it's not me.
- [laughter]

789
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:50,103
This is going to be good.

790
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:52,413
PROBST:
Kane, if you had your choice,

791
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,061
you could play a season
of Survivorlike this,

792
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:55,586
where it's chaotic
and it's crazy,

793
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:58,620
or you could play
a very quiet season of Survivor,

794
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,620
- which do you choose?
- Probably quiet.

795
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,517
- PROBST: Really?
- I'm just kidding.

796
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,965
I love the chaos. It's money.

797
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:08,896
I would 100 times out of 100
times choose the chaotic season

798
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,931
because, to me,
every single person

799
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:12,965
sitting here
is playing this game,

800
00:36:13,068 --> 00:36:14,586
and that's what
makes me excited.

801
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:16,206
That's why I'm here.

802
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,689
I'm not here for a walk in Fiji.

803
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:20,862
PROBST: Danny, how about you?

804
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:23,586
When you're playing Survivor,
this is what you want, right?

805
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:25,896
DANNY: Yeah. I mean,
in the game of Survivor,

806
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,751
sometimes you're going
to be driving the car,

807
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:29,193
but sometimes
you got to be all ears

808
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:31,896
and, uh, just pick
which back seat to get into

809
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,379
and, you know,
survive Tribal always.

810
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:37,310
Well, with this group,
I tend to believe you

811
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:39,655
that you're listening
even right now

812
00:36:39,758 --> 00:36:41,172
for somebody to say something

813
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:42,613
that doesn't ring true,
that might change your mind,

814
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:44,793
even the way
you're looking at me, Carolyn.

815
00:36:44,896 --> 00:36:46,448
How certain are you
about your vote?

816
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,586
I feel worse coming here.

817
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:50,034
I mean, honestly,

818
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,578
everyone's telling me
that they're going

819
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,896
back and forth on the plan.

820
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,068
So I'm looking, like,
can someone give me a nod

821
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,724
or something?

822
00:36:56,827 --> 00:36:58,551
So, it's like...

823
00:36:58,655 --> 00:37:01,275
Now we're whispering. I can't.

824
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:05,448
Yam Yam, does the whispering
make you nervous?

825
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:07,172
Yes.

826
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,379
- Um...
- [Probst laughs]

827
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:14,068
It make me super nervous
because...

828
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:17,827
I mean, this game,
it just explodes when

829
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:19,137
there are so many plans.

830
00:37:19,241 --> 00:37:20,655
Who has the original one?

I have the best seat.

835
00:38:10,862 --> 00:38:13,448
- I can see it all.
- [laughs]

00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:21,206
Wow. Well, I feel like there are
no questions I need to ask.

837

Are we ready to vote?

838

It might change if we don't.
