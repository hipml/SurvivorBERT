1
00:00:06,482 --> 00:00:08,413
Okay.

2
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:10,068
We all know I'm the backup.
We know I'm on the bottom.

3
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:11,896
-Sorry, Jake.
I don't even want to say

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,344
I was left in the dark.

5
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:14,689
I wasn't even left
in the same dimension.

6
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:17,310
Previously onSurvivor...

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,448
Yeah.

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,827
I placed one of my idols
in Julie's bag

9
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,000
to make sure she stayed safe.

10
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:26,586
This is it.

11
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,103
-Julie drops.

12
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:33,344
-Bruce wins his second
individual immunity in a row.
Wow.

13
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:34,931
Ugh. Bruce winning

14
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,448
another immunity is tough.

15
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:40,379
I already know
everybody wants Jake out.

16
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:43,068
Such an easy vote,
but I don't want that.

17
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:44,413
She's trying to get me out.

18
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:46,034
I want Kendra out,

19
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:47,517
and that's what
I'm gonna push for.

20
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,344
Tenth person voted out

21
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:52,000
and the third member
of our jury: Kendra.

22
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:55,448
The tribe has spoken.

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,724
That Tribal Council...
Oh, my gosh.

24
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:13,758
And thank you for, uh,
not voting for me tonight.

25
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:15,310
Appreciate it.

26
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:19,241
So tonight, Kendra was
blindsided, and I'm still alive.

27
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:22,620
I had to play the dead dog
for the last two votes,

28
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:24,551
and I don't have
to do that anymore.

29
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:26,000
I got friends in this game.

30
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:27,551
I got people
who want to look out for me.

31
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,827
Knock on wood, but I think
I'm back in this game.

32
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:32,793
I'm back in this game
as a player, not as a pawn.

33
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:34,758
That was a huge thing,
and that was like, whoa,

34
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,517
but I hope you guys know that,
like, I got your backs.

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,896
You know what I mean?

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Jake, you know, he's just
bumming through the game.

37
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:41,482
He's like Charlie Brown.

38
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:43,000
There's a rain cloud that
follows over the top of him.

39
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,965
And miraculously,
people are just

40
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:46,378
aiming right past him
at other targets.

41
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,378
Interesting that
Bruce ended up...

42
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,896
I mean, I guess he never
really liked Kendra, but...

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,758
-Just let her go.
Voted with it-- for her.
Yeah.

44
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,517
Just-just went with it.

45
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,620
On the other hand,
Bruce continues to be

46
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:58,827
in a very interesting spot
in the game,

47
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:01,517
where he has power, right?
He has the idol.

48
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,586
Okay, so we need to get rid
of Bruce's idol the next go.

49
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,689
Oh, yeah.
We do.

50
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,172
And so he pretty much

51
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,862
is guaranteed to play that
at next Tribal Council.

52
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:11,517
Unless
he wins immunity again.
-Yeah.

53
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,758
The problem is that

54
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:14,137
Bruce winning
all these challenges

55
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,379
shreds any possibilities

56
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:17,000
of flushing his idol.

57
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,310
When I was in the Navy,
I was a young, strapping lad.

58
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:21,862
Okay. Okay.
Too soon. Too soon.
-Okay. Okay.

59
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,344
So for my sake, and for the sake

60
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:24,758
of everyone else out here,

61
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:26,241
Bruce's immunity run

62
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:29,793
has to come
to a clean and swift end ASAP.

63
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,482
Like a freaking baby.

64
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:45,172
We're in
such a small group here.

65
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,965
-It's just so crazy.
I know.
It's kind of weird.

66
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,689
-It's like...
It is weird, man.

67
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,689
We're really gonna be leaning
on each other after this.

68
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:51,793
-That's for sure.
Yeah.

69
00:03:57,034 --> 00:04:00,034
I did not sleep last night.
I just couldn't sleep.

70
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:01,689
Because I am

71
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:03,275
connecting with people.
They're trusting me,

72
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,655
and I'm lying to their face.

73
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,137
Ninth person voted out

74
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,344
and the second member
of our jury: Kellie.

75
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,689
What the hell, guys?

76
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:11,241
I mean, oh,

77
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:14,689
with both Kellie and Kendra,
I was devastated.

78
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:17,517
They just wouldn't even
look at me. It felt so personal.

79
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,793
The feeling of betrayal
is hard for me.

80
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:23,241
I am used to being very loyal

81
00:04:23,344 --> 00:04:25,689
and trustworthy,
and you can count on me

82
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:27,310
no matter what.

83
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,137
Just the thought that there
are two people out there

84
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,931
that are like,
"Man, I wouldn't trust Julie

85
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:33,689
as far as I could throw her"
hurts me.

86
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:35,586
-Oh, come on, Julie.
-Sorry. Sorry.

87
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,551
No, it's okay. It's okay.

88
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:39,551
It's just,
I don't lie in real life.

89
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,517
I didn't understand
how powerful my role--

90
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,172
that I agreed to,
that they put me in--

91
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,620
as this mama, trusting character

92
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:50,068
would make it hurt that much.

93
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,586
There is a chance,
at the end here,

94
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,241
-that things could get hairy.
-Yep.

95
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:55,241
You four are, like,
people who, like,

96
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:58,000
I-I really, you know, I really
care about deeply, and...

97
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,310
-And I'm saying, you...
-Okay.

98
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,413
I just want to know that, like,

99
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,310
we're all gonna be okay.

100
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:04,448
-Like, we're good no matter
what. We're good no matter what.
-100%.

101
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,551
-Hundred percent, Drew.
-Okay. All right.

102
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:08,689
We're getting close to the end,

103
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:11,517
and it's even more complex
and harder than I thought.

104
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,172
It's an emotional mental test
for all of us.

105
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,620
I mean, I have
loved my alliance of four

106
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:21,655
with Drew, Austin,
Dee and myself,

107
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:25,689
but, at some point,
we got to turn on each other.

108
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,068
I almost can't even go there.

109
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:30,000
How do you vote them out
and they love you?

110
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:32,034
I mean, are you kidding me?

111
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:34,862
Yeah, it's four-four.
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,724
Yeah.

113
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:40,379
That's what's scaring me.

114
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:42,034
-Yeah.
Who's making decisions
for those four?

115
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:44,034
Do we know?
Is Dee the one that says,

116
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:46,206
-"Here's the vote,"
and they all...
-Um... I don't know.

117
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,620
Right now,

118
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,517
there's still four people
who have come in

119
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,344
from a majority alliance
into the merge.

120
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:54,103
And part of me
thinks they're not

121
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:56,000
going to turn on each other.
It scares me.

122
00:05:56,103 --> 00:05:58,655
I-I hope that
Drew, Austin and myself

123
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,344
are working together,
but I am now re-questioning

124
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,965
my alliances,
where people are standing.

125
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:06,551
And I'm being forced to go back
and forge new relationships.

126
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:09,310
If we want to make something
happen for the other side...

127
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:12,586
-Yeah. Yeah.
-we're gonna all have
to get together, and... Yeah.

128
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,275
What are
your thoughts about that?

129
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,620
Um...

130
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:17,241
If I were to make a big move

131
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,793
against this strong Reba four,
I need support.

132
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:22,103
And what's extremely frustrating
about working

133
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:23,655
with Jake, Bruce and Katurah

134
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,000
is they don't know
how to work together at all.

135
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm on the chopping block
for the next time we go,

136
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:29,379
-just because of...
Only your idol.

137
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:31,379
-That's the only... Yeah.
-Yeah.

138
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:33,793
Then on top of it, Bruce
doesn't seem interested at all

139
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:35,172
in playing
his idol strategically.

140
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,344
He's only interested
in protecting his own butt

141
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:38,827
-with his idol.
-Uh, all right.

142
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,241
And what he's not realizing

143
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:41,655
is he actually
has an opportunity to flip

144
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:43,137
the power dynamic
while there's still,

145
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,000
theoretically,
four and four on this tribe.

146
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,689
I'm so glad
we're back working together.

147
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:49,172
-Thank you very much.
-Yeah.

148
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,137
It just feels so good
to be back on the same page.

149
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:53,310
Between you and I
and nobody else...

150
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,137
Yeah? Uh-oh.

151
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,862
-What?
-The worst thing that
you could ever do in Survivor.

152
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,413
What's the thing you did?

153
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,862
You gave her your idol?

154
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,448
Wait, no, you didn't.

155
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:09,034
Hypothetically,
someone could take my idol

156
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,793
if they had the
Knowledge Is Power Advantage,

157
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:13,344
so I gave my idol to Kellie

158
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,724
to hold on to,
because I was nervous

159
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,275
of the Knowledge Is Power.

160
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:18,034
Kellie got voted out
with my idol.

161
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,827
Worst-case scenario.

162
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:23,620
Well, "Oh, no.
I lost my-my idol."

163
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:27,275
But it's in my pocket.
So...

164
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:29,827
I tested out
my first really big lie.

165
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:36,137
-I still have that. I'm not...
-Why...

166
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:39,137
-But here's the deal. I need...
-What is that...

167
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,172
-Listen. Listen, listen.
-Damn it.

168
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,034
I'm saying it to you,
'cause how did you feel

169
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:44,827
about my acting
when I told you about that?

170
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,586
-I believed you.
-One of them are gonna get that.

171
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,586
Okay. Okay.

172
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,586
-You feel me?
-No, I don't.

173
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,241
Bruce's plan is ridiculous.

174
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:56,965
I didn't believe it
for a second.

175
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:58,931
I mean, I don't believe
anything he ever says to me,

176
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:00,241
but it doesn't really matter,

177
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:02,000
because this won't work.

178
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:03,620
Everybody knows he has an idol.

179
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:06,034
No one's gonna believe this,
by the way. Like, no one will.

180
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:10,000
-I started freaking out
because Knowledge Is Power.
-Okay.

181
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,137
So she got voted out
with an idol in her pocket?

182
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,413
With an idol in her pocket.

183
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,689
-My...
-Your idol in her pocket.

184
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:15,827
Yay.

185
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,448
Okay, that's a...
that's a problem.

186
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:19,344
Now I got
to fight a different way.

187
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:22,586
My diabolical plan--
it's working.

188
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,344
So I'm leaking information.
I'm like my own TMZ right now.

189
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,931
I mean, look,
it was the right move,

190
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,379
but you bet on the wrong horse.
That's all.

191
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:29,758
-You know what I mean?
-Right.

192
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:31,379
With this lie
that I'm telling Jake,

193
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,827
it will get out.
I know it will.

194
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,206
He's going
to spill the beans to Reba,

195
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,275
because Jake
does not have the ability

196
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:41,724
to play this game in a way
to keep his mouth shut.

197
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:44,931
Okay. All right. All right.

198
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,758
All right. Cool.

199
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,896
I need them to think
that I'm vulnerable,

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,965
because now, the four Reba--
they're all gonna vote for me,

201
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,724
and then I play that idol,
I could turn and look and say,

202
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,310
"Sorry, not today," and then

203
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,931
kiss your backside goodbye.

204
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,517
I'll see if the plan works.

205
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:20,068
Come on in.

206
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:22,689
Oh.
Wow.

207
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,172
Oh, no.

208
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:27,310
Crazy.

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,137
Morning, Jeff.

210
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,310
-Good morning.
Hey, Probst.

211
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:36,379
All right, shall we get
to today's reward challenge?

212
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:38,241
-Yes.
-Yeah.

213
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,000
For today's challenge,
you're gonna race through

214
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:42,758
a series of obstacles,
collecting a ball along the way.

215
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,000
You'll then crawl under a net
and, ultimately,

216
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:48,655
maneuver that ball
through a maze.

217
00:09:51,344 --> 00:09:53,551
First person to finish
wins reward.

218
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,413
-Want to know
what you're playing for?
-Yeah.

219
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:58,275
You'll leave here
and be taken to the sanctuary...

220
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:00,896
...where good things happen.

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,448
-Today, very good things.
-Ooh.

222
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,241
You'll have dinner.

223
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:07,310
-Turkey.
-Ooh.

224
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:08,517
Mashed potatoes and gravy.

225
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,448
-Yeah. There it is.
-Oh, my gosh.

226
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:11,482
Little apple pie.

227
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:12,655
Yes.
-Oh!

228
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:15,275
Beer. Soda.
-Oh, my God.

229
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,034
Juice.
-He's not stopping.

230
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:18,620
-Oh, my gosh.
-I'm not stopping.
Let's make it even better.

231
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:20,034
You're gonna spend the night...

232
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:22,172
-Whoa! Whoa!

233
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:25,586
...at the sanctuary,
where you will have pillows...

234
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:27,689
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my gosh.
...blanket.

235
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:31,931
Worth playing for?

236
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,586
-Uh, yeah. Yeah.
Hell yeah. What?

237
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:36,620
All right, we're gonna draw
for spots. We'll get it on.

238
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:38,551
-Let's go, baby!
-Oh, my God.

239
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:48,275
Here we go. For reward
and a night at the sanctuary.

240
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:49,448
Survivors ready?

241
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:53,413
Go!

242
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:57,241
-This first stage
is over, over and then under.

243
00:10:57,344 --> 00:11:00,000
That's how you do it.
Attack this challenge!

244
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,448
Austin's through first.

245
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:07,689
There's Bruce. There goes Dee.

246
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,758
-There goes Jake.

247
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:12,034
Now you've got
to untie a series of knots.

248
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:14,517
Emily's through.
Here comes Katurah.

249
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,206
Julie now through.

250
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,965
You got to untie every knot.

251
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:22,000
Once you have the bag
released from the knot,

252
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:23,517
start crawling underneath.

253
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:28,241
Jake is through first.
Look at that.

254
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,448
Here comes Dee.

255
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:33,689
There's Bruce. Austin now in it.

256
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,310
Day 18, Survivor45.
Ain't nothing easy.

257
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:39,862
It is Emily and Julie
all the way back.

258
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,620
It is Jake in the lead. You're
trying to get to that maze.

259
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,517
Wow. And very quickly,
Austin makes up a lot of time.

260
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,724
Austin is now to the maze first.
There's Jake.

261
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,413
Here comes Dee.

262
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:55,551
Keep digging.
Drew is through.

263
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:58,241
Here comes Bruce.
Here comes Emily.

264
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:02,862
-What?
Here comes Katurah.

265
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:05,034
Kneecap by kneecap,

266
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:07,793
Julie is
working her way through.

267
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,275
There you go, Julie.

268
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,586
Big reward on the line.

269
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,896
Night at the sanctuary.

270
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:16,931
-Oh, shoot.
This is a lot of touch.

271
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,068
You got to figure out the maze.

272
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,551
Then you've got
to have that deft touch

273
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:24,586
to avoid the holes,
like Emily just did.

274
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:27,034
Your ball will drop.
That's okay.

275
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:31,000
Learn each time you do it.

276
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,137
That's the key.

277
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,103
Austin drops.
He's got to start again.

278
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,310
Jake drops.
Got to start again.

279
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,758
Drew drops.

280
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:46,275
No.

281
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,413
Bruce drops.

282
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,689
Dee making some nice progress.

283
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:50,965
Relax.

284
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,689
But drops.
-Damn it.

285
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:58,000
Emily's out on it now.

286
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:02,275
Austin, once again,
giving it another go.

287
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:03,758
No, no, no, no.

288
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:05,448
Katurah drops.
Got to start again.

289
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:11,965
Julie drops. Somebody's
gonna get a rhythm going.

290
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:14,413
And out of nowhere,
they're gonna win this.

291
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:16,310
That's how it goes.

292
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,965
Emily making a lot of progress.

293
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,551
Austin gaining a lot
of ground on that maze.

294
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:28,137
It is Austin and Emily

295
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,482
in a showdown right now
to win it.

296
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,413
Emily very close to the center,
but one big obstacle left

297
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,793
for the biggest reward
of the season.

298
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:43,793
It is literally side by side,
neck and neck between these two.

299
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,620
Emily really
is going for the big move.

300
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:50,896
She's in the center.
Can she stick it?

301
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:55,586
Austin right on her tail.

302
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:02,827
Literally inches away
from disaster or victory.

303
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:09,586
Austin very close,
but he drops at the last spot.

304
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,068
-Emily gets it.

305
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,379
Emily wins reward.
Wow.

306
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,655
Biggest reward
of the season.

307
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:23,275
Her body is shaking.
Literally shaking.

308
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:26,068
It has been an emotional
18 days for Emily

309
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:28,137
of highs and lows.

310
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:31,206
-This has got to be at the top.
-Unbelievable. Good job, Emily.

311
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,482
Yeah!
You're going to the sanctuary!

312
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:35,655
On your own, too.

313
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:36,793
Wow.

314
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,862
Emily, walk me through
what happened

315
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,448
right after you won,
because even where I was,

316
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:47,517
standing behind you,
I saw your body start to shake.

317
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,689
Um, honestly, it's surreal.
I've said it from the beginning.

318
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:51,482
I came here not expecting
to win anything.

319
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,206
I mean, look at all of them
and look at me.

320
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,827
Um, but coming into today's
challenge, we had talked.

321
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:58,275
We figured
it was a reward challenge,

322
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,241
and everybody was saying,
"Well, Emily, if we have

323
00:15:00,344 --> 00:15:01,862
-the chance to take someone,
we'll take you."
-Mm-hmm.

324
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,379
"You haven't been
to the sanctuary yet." And it...

325
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:05,344
And I really appreciate
that mentality, but it kind of

326
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:07,034
makes you feel
really bad about yourself,

327
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:08,655
because, you know,
I want to deserve it.

328
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:11,068
I want to earn it. If I get
there, I get there on my own,

329
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:12,896
and I'm really happy
that-that I'm gonna

330
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,137
-get there on my own today.
Yes.

331
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,034
You are.
-Yes, you are!

332
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:18,344
-Yes, you are!

333
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:19,551
Come on over. Right here.

334
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,551
-There you go, Emily.

335
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:24,103
Dance, dance, dance.

336
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:26,379
All right,
so here's the deal, Emily.

337
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:28,344
You're gonna spend the night
at the sanctuary,

338
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:30,034
where you're gonna have turkey,

339
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,827
mashed potatoes, gravy, pie.

340
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,068
Oh, my gosh.

341
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:36,310
After you enjoy your dinner,

342
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,379
as you cozy up with your pillow,
you will have

343
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:41,862
a very clear reminder
of why you are here,

344
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:45,379
-with your letters from home.
-Oh, you g...

345
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:49,862
So now you have
a very complicated decision.

346
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:52,620
Choose one person
to join you at the sanctuary

347
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:55,965
for the biggest reward
of the season.

348
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:00,310
Mama J, you have not
been sleeping.

349
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:01,689
Your neck woke up this morning,

350
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,000
and you
were in such severe pain.

351
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:06,103
I know that letter from home
and that bed will do you good,

352
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,758
so come join me.

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,034
Julie, what's the feeling?

354
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,965
You're not
even at the sanctuary,

355
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,103
but clearly
you're already starting

356
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:20,206
to anticipate what this
is gonna do for you.

357
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,379
I don't even know
if I can talk about it.

358
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,068
I can't even imagine.

359
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:27,793
This morning
was the roughest I've had, so...

360
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,689
-In terms of missing home.
-Missing home,

361
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:33,724
and, um, I'm hoping that
this gives me the strength.

362
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,137
-Thank you.
-All right, Emily,
choose another person

363
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,517
to join you at the sanctuary.

364
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,758
Mm.

365
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:47,034
-Katurah, come join.
-Really?

366
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:48,413
:
Really?

367
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:52,620
:
I'm the last one I expected.

368
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:54,172
Do you not want to?
Do you not want to?

369
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:56,137
-No, I want to.
I'm just so happy.
-Okay.

370
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,000
-I'm glad you want it, too.
Like,
I didn't expect it at all,

371
00:16:58,103 --> 00:17:01,586
and I was just bracing myself
for not getting it.

372
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:05,103
Drew.
-Yeah.

373
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:07,931
What's going on?

374
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:09,655
It's a hard choice,
and I think everyone wants it.

375
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:10,827
Everyone wants the food,
everyone wants

376
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,241
the comfort from home,

377
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:14,413
and I-I don't
have anything more-more to say.

378
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,241
It's a tough spot.

379
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:21,241
-Emily, you have one more spot.

380
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:25,862
I know there's
one person out here

381
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:28,103
who has talked about
her family every single day.

382
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,241
Dee, let's
make it a ladies night.

383
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:31,172
-Yes.
-Come on over, Dee.

384
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,344
All right, Emily,

385
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:39,896
Dee, Julie, Katurah,
grab your stuff, head out.

386
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,413
Enjoy the sanctuary.

387
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:42,793
-Have fun, ladies.
-Congratulations.

388
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,586
:
Oh, my God.

389
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:49,827
All right, Drew, Austin, Jake,
Bruce, got nothing for you.

390
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:50,896
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

391
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,241
Thank you.

392
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:54,172
All right, massive pot of rice.

393
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:56,827
Extra big.

394
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:58,793
This reward
is the most significant

395
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:00,655
in terms of bonding
that you get.

396
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:01,896
Letters from home

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,103
would bring anyone
tighter together,

398
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:05,551
so obviously, yes,

399
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:08,137
I'm a little nervous
about a girls night.

400
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:10,103
You just have to hope that
everything you built

401
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:11,758
is enough to carry over

402
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:14,862
one amazing night
at the sanctuary.

403
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:22,137
Emily just made the biggest
decision of the season.

404
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:24,758
And it's these kind of moments
that make Survivor

405
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:26,517
so fun to play.
Apply to be on Survivor.

406
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,034
Oh, my gosh.

407
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:35,482
Oh my gosh.
Oh, look at the beanbag.

408
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,034
Oh, my gosh.

409
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:43,379
Oh, my God.

410
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:44,482
:
Emily! Emily!

411
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,344
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

412
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:48,793
-Darling, thank you.
-Oh, my God.

413
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:50,103
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

414
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:51,931
For Emily to win

415
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:53,758
is one of the greatest moments,

416
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:55,310
I think, of our season.

417
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,206
She did it. She brought
herself to the sanctuary.

418
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,586
When I heard that this
was gonna be an overnight,

419
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,620
I already knew
I was taking my girls.

420
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,068
-For what it's worth. Yes, 100%.
-Yeah! Oh, my God!

421
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:08,655
This is probably the greatest
reward. Turns out, she picks

422
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:09,793
all the women on the tribe.

423
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,172
So the men are back.

424
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,655
They're having their boys night,

425
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:13,965
and we're gonna
have a girls night.

426
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,034
This whole adventure
has been so weird.

427
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:18,896
I feel like, in my little time
of knowing you,

428
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,931
-I think you underestimate
yourself a lot.
Yes.

429
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:24,965
I don't think that you realize
how big of a force you are.

430
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:26,689
I hope you see
what we see in you, and...

431
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,793
Not just us. Like,
everybody else, too, you know?

432
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:30,413
Mm-hmm. Agreed.

433
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:31,793
Thank you, guys.

434
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:33,586
To be honest,
I never thought I'd win

435
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:34,655
any sort of challenge--
nonetheless

436
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,379
a reward challenge of this size.

437
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:38,482
I am so proud of the fact
that I'm sitting right here.

438
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:40,551
I know what I've been through,
and it's absolutely

439
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:43,241
just a little tiny piece
of paradise in what has

440
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:45,310
otherwise been this kind of,
like, hellscape

441
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:46,965
of an experience for me
on Survivor.

442
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:49,034
We are going
to have a female winner

443
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:50,551
-for season 45 of Survivor.
-I love this. I love this.

444
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,275
-I call it. Yes. Yes.
Yes.

445
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:53,551
We're over here

446
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:55,310
drinking sangria,
we're chatting. I mean,

447
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:56,689
we're just connecting
as humans.

448
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:58,689
The four of us
get along wonderfully.

449
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:00,344
And those vibes--
I mean, just great vibes.

450
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,137
Julie, you've been in there

451
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:04,862
-for every single challenge,
every single one.
-Oh, you're sweet.

452
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:06,241
I haven't
brought it home, but...

453
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:07,724
-You'll bring it home.
You will. Watch.

454
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:09,517
-We just got to, you know...
-All right. This is...

455
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:12,689
Then
we can win these challenges.

456
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:14,448
-He has an idol, too, so...
-Yep.

457
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:15,827
He needs to go.

458
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:17,413
Well, I think
he's gonna try to...

459
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:20,068
The lie he told me he's gonna
try to push off on everybody

460
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,206
is that Kellie...

461
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,931
w-walked out the door
with his idol in her pocket.

462
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,586
I think it's a little
too late to make that comment.

463
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,103
-I'm just gonna say,
like, the day of.
Yeah.

464
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:30,103
He was like, "Do you think
people will believe it?"

465
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,689
I said, "I mean, I believed it."

466
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:34,137
That's good.

467
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:37,931
Bruce made this half-brain plan,

468
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:41,000
and I told the girls, because
I have no loyalty to Bruce.

469
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:42,724
He was a terrible
alliance member,

470
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:45,068
and that's
why I'm in revenge mode.

471
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:47,931
We, fueled by this
wonderful Thanksgiving meal,

472
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:50,034
show up to the immunity
challenge tomorrow, crush it.

473
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:52,517
-Mm-hmm.
-Flush Bruce's idol.
We get him out next time.

474
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,827
I agree. A thousand percent.

475
00:20:54,931 --> 00:20:56,620
Or if he plays his idol,
then Jake,

476
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,241
but we got to flush his idol.

477
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:01,965
Are you guys okay with putting
more votes on Bruce, though?

478
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:03,413
Like, in case
he doesn't play the idol,

479
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:04,551
-so he can go home first?
Of course.

480
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:05,896
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

481
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,103
And that would
just be even more delicious.

482
00:21:07,206 --> 00:21:08,724
-Yeah.

483
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:11,103
I can't wait
to get Bruce out, but

484
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:12,931
Bruce is gonna play his idol.

485
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,793
So having Jake
as the backup vote is very safe.

486
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:19,241
He's kind of alone.
He has no real allies right now.

487
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,379
What do you think
the guys are saying right now?

488
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:23,034
-It'll be fine.
-They're having boys night.

489
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:25,172
We're having a girls night.
Let's go.

490
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:26,551
This is heaven.

491
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,068
Wow.

492
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,931
Boys' camping trip tonight.

493
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah.
Yeah, what's up?

494
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,448
-None of mine have had
much volume out here, honestly.
-Same.

495
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:40,931
-Yeah.
-I don't know
if I've farted in 18 days.

496
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,655
That's not true.
I did fart once.

497
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:45,482
-Ah. What-what spurred it?
Okay.

498
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:48,275
It was, uh, it was
definitely a merge feast fart.

499
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:49,689
Oh. Nice.

500
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:50,862
Nothing from the candy, though?

501
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:51,931
-Italian.
-Oh.

502
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:55,172
Oh, there we go.

503
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:56,965
There you go.
That was good.

504
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:58,206
Passing gas is happening.

505
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,724
Men's day, baby. Let's go.

506
00:22:01,206 --> 00:22:02,448
-Oh!

507
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:05,241
-Oh!

508
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:07,655
-Guys being dudes.

509
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:11,310
Ladies night at the sanctuary.
Boys night out camping.

510
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:16,413
There's a little more
flatulence, little more burping,

511
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:17,413
and it's nice to just be

512
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:19,344
the guys sometimes, you know?

513
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:20,931
You haven't
gotten that in 18 days,

514
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:24,000
and it's just the boys.
Like, let's do it up, guys.

515
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:36,241
Oh, yeah. My man.

516
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:37,551
Yeah. Come here. Come here.

517
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,965
You know, I have
never been one of the boys.

518
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,448
I have never bro'd out.

519
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:50,965
Like, I've observed

520
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:53,724
the "bro-out" only from
an anthropological distance.

521
00:22:53,827 --> 00:22:55,379
Yeah.

522
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:58,758
We can talk about all this, uh,
this locker-room stuff, I guess.

523
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:01,689
We talked about food a lot.

524
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:03,689
We talked about,
like, action movies.

525
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:05,586
Like, the stuff that the girls
don't want to talk about.

526
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,551
It's, like, okay, bacon is good,

527
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:09,689
-but it's not, like,
amazing. I mean...
-Bacon is pretty good.

528
00:23:09,793 --> 00:23:11,793
It's a little overrated.
Pork is very fatty.

529
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:13,758
I'm doing my best,
but, you know, it was fun,

530
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:15,724
and you got to try new things
out here on Survivor.

531
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:16,896
So I-I tried to bro out.

532
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:24,655
All right.

533
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:26,275
Here we go, man.

534
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:28,068
Bring home the fish.

535
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,034
It's so much fun
trying to catch your own fish.

536
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:42,379
I've never done it before.
I've never speared fish before.

537
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:47,862
I've been fighting for fish
for hours out there,

538
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:50,000
only getting little tiny ones.

539
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:54,034
But it's not only about eating,
but just, like,

540
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:56,137
enjoying all this wildlife.
Fiji is gorgeous.

541
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:58,793
To be able to have,
like, my backyard

542
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,551
be this gorgeous
Fiji coral, like,

543
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:03,758
unbelievable.

544
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:06,620
And, oh, my gosh.

545
00:24:06,724 --> 00:24:10,724
Finally, my first big catch.
It was amazing.

546
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:13,275
Hey, it's
a Thanksgiving feast today.

547
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:15,241
-Whoo!
Yeah, man.

548
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,068
-That's an actual fish.

549
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:18,517
Everyone got excited.
They're like,

550
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,448
"Wow, we're actually
gonna have some meat tonight."

551
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:24,517
-I'll try one more.
Go ahead, Aquaman.

552
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,896
We know the women are feasting.

553
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,068
We have to eat
something substantial

554
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:32,379
just so that we can keep up with
the ladies when they get back.

555
00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:33,724
-Whoo!
Got it?

556
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:35,517
Got another one?

557
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,068
Hey, it's working.

558
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:40,655
Listen to me. Listen to me.

559
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:42,206
I think, for you and I,

560
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,965
the preemptive strike
to talk about now would be...

561
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:50,689
I see what you're saying.
-Remember,

562
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,620
I'm trying to c...
find ways to save my own ass.

563
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,655
No, I know.

564
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,344
Me not having my freaking idol,

565
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:57,655
I'm, you know,
I'm putting all my chips

566
00:24:57,758 --> 00:24:58,827
on the table right now.

567
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,793
Yeah, no. Dee needs to go.

568
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:02,655
It's just, how do we do it?

569
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:06,965
Very much so. But I got
to find out where her mind is.

570
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:09,793
I know that she's not
too keen on going after Dee.

571
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:12,241
Bruce is like, "Dee, she's
a huge threat in this game."

572
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,896
But it's not happening.

573
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,344
As much as I love Bruce, I need
to unhitch my wagon to him.

574
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:18,931
We've been
connected this whole game,

575
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:21,862
and if I'm attached to him,
people see us as a pair,

576
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:23,551
I become a bigger target.

577
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,827
And so what he's thinking
is that it's gonna be Dee.

578
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:28,379
Hmm. I think the odds
of that working out are slim.

579
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:29,689
Yeah, I agree.

580
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,034
People have said
Bruce is only dangerous

581
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:33,068
because he's
holding on to that idol.

582
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:35,068
If he gave his idol to Kellie,

583
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:37,241
there's a good chance
that idol is no longer here.

584
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:40,068
That puts Bruce's butt
in a dangerous place.

585
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,275
All that matters,
that idol goes.

586
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:42,724
-It doesn't matter who goes.
-Yeah.

587
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:45,034
-I got
to tell you something, man.
-What?

588
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:46,551
See how disappointed
Kellie was leaving?

589
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:47,827
Yeah. She had an idol?

590
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:49,379
She had his.

591
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:51,172
You're kidding.

592
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:54,172
You're kidding. You're
shutting-the-front-door kidding.

593
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:56,689
-He doesn't have an idol.
-I don't think so.

594
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:59,172
Oh, my freaking God.

595
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:00,482
We're good.

596
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:02,000
-We're good. We're totally good.
-We're good.

597
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,482
I don't want Bruce's
threat level going down.

598
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:05,896
I want it staying up.
So I'm telling Drew.

599
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,068
I have a working relationship
with Drew.

600
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:09,344
I think he's helping me out

601
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,517
right now,
and I think he's valuable to me.

602
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,586
Like, it's like there's, like,
two headlights on Bruce,

603
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:15,068
and he's, like,
America's Most Wanted.

604
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:16,517
Yeah.

605
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh.

606
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:20,034
Jake is kind of
a puppy dog, at this point,

607
00:26:20,137 --> 00:26:21,586
for Austin and myself.

608
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:23,965
Jake,
who hasn't had a clue in days,

609
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,413
suddenly comes to me

610
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,655
with a pressing bit
of confidential information.

611
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:28,965
Immediately,

612
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:30,413
I was overjoyed.

613
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:33,172
Bruce came up to Jake
and told him that

614
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:34,827
he had given his idol to Kellie.

615
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:37,620
-Oh, my freaking goodness.
-My God.

616
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:40,310
-If it's true. If it's true...
-Dude, that move was,
like, one of the best moves.

617
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:42,448
Oh, it was so trusting.

618
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:43,758
Oh.

619
00:26:43,862 --> 00:26:45,413
Things are looking sweet.

620
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:49,206
The chopping block right now
is Bruce, and Jake is desperate.

621
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,724
Both of them are essentially
drawing dead in the game.

622
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:02,068
Kind of nervous
for these letters.

623
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:04,551
Like, our family wrote to us.

624
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:06,448
Oh, my God.

625
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:08,241
Okay, are we opening?

626
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:09,827
-Are we doing this?
-I'm like, I'm sorry.
I can't even wait.

627
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:12,379
Just seeing all the letters,

628
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:14,000
it just reminded me

629
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:16,482
I am so rich

630
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:18,379
with an amazing family.

631
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:22,620
OnSurvivor, if the food is
the fuel, the letters are fire.

632
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,448
In this game, fire is your life.

633
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:29,586
So these letters, they just
reminded me of who I am.

634
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,620
And my brother Dan said,
"At the time of your divorce,

635
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:35,103
"with no career,
no home and two small children,

636
00:27:35,206 --> 00:27:37,137
you needed a hero,
so you became one."

637
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:41,655
"I just want you to know
that long before that,

638
00:27:41,758 --> 00:27:44,034
and to this day, you have
always been a hero to me."

639
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:45,655
My dad says...

640
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:14,310
I haven't, like, let myself
think about the fact that

641
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:16,793
while I'm out here, Eric is,
like, moving into our house.

642
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:19,827
Oh, wow.
-Um... And it's like
this big life moment

643
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:20,965
-that I'm just missing.
-Yeah.

644
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:22,344
Like, it's our first house
together,

645
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:24,344
and I'm just not there
at all for any of it.

646
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,241
And he's like, you know, "When
you come back to the house..."

647
00:28:26,344 --> 00:28:28,448
and "So excited
to bring you to the new house."

648
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:30,241
And, you know...

649
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:31,862
Anyway, I just...

650
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:34,068
I think I feel a lot of guilt
for missing what should be,

651
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:35,965
-like, a big life moment.
-Yeah.

652
00:28:36,068 --> 00:28:38,275
The first letter I open
is from Eric, my boyfriend.

653
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:40,103
We've been together
for almost a decade,

654
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:42,137
and I've said,
almost my entire life,

655
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,034
"I don't think
I want to get married."

656
00:28:44,137 --> 00:28:45,862
I don't view myself as a wife.

657
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,275
I don't view myself as...

658
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:49,000
It's not a term
that I use to describe myself.

659
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,344
And now I'm out here,
and I can't imagine myself

660
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:53,310
not spending
the rest of my life with Eric.

661
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:55,931
You think about somebody
every single day, and...

662
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,275
It's funny, when you get
stripped of everything else,

663
00:28:58,379 --> 00:29:00,931
when you get stripped of all
this BS that exists in life...

664
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,931
...that makes
you realize what's important.

665
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,206
All these notions
that I force on myself

666
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,413
to be a certain way,
I don't need to be that.

667
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:10,034
I can just be Emily.

668
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:12,034
And maybe Emily loves Eric,
and maybe that's okay.

669
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:13,965
And maybe Emily
will get married.

670
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,103
That's a really
weird thing to say.

671
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:19,068
I'm not making any promises, but
maybe Emily will get married.

672
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,689
Thank you for letting us
have this moment.

673
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,793
-Thank you so much, Emily.
-Yeah, of course.
Thank you, guys.

674
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,241
This is
the best day of Survivor.

675
00:29:25,344 --> 00:29:26,862
Nothing will top this.

676
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm having a little bit
of a conflicting feeling.

677
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,758
Aw...

678
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:47,551
-And I just did not expect it.
Yep.

679
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,655
-And now I'm feeling all,
like...
I bet.

680
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:52,551
Just, I don't really know how
to feel about it.

681
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:56,068
I went no contact with my mom,
like, a year ago.

682
00:29:56,172 --> 00:29:58,068
And so I'm not, like, hiding it.

683
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,172
I just did not
expect that to come up.

684
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:03,517
-You are a warrior,
and I'm so proud of you.

685
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,620
Thank you so much.

686
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:06,862
I-I support you 100%.

687
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:11,103
My true whole life story
is just literally all sad,

688
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:14,862
and I don't want to let myself
fall into that pit of darkness.

689
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:18,034
I need to win this game,
and I'm not gonna win this game

690
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:20,172
if I'm thinking
about all my sad stuff.

691
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:26,655
So, yeah, I'm gonna finish
this glass of wine.

692
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:37,379
Morning!
Morning.

693
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:38,620
-Morning.
-Oh, hi, boys.

694
00:30:38,724 --> 00:30:39,931
-Morning.

695
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:41,379
How are y'all?

696
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,793
Yeah?

697
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:48,413
The boys day
was an interesting experience.

698
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:49,931
It was like letting
your hair down a little bit,

699
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:52,655
but it's nice
to have the girls return home.

700
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:54,655
And I'll be interested to hear

701
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:56,137
the details
of that whole sanctuary trip.

702
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:58,620
Nobody in that group
of four wants to target y'all.

703
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,482
-Yeah.
-Especially not
before Jake and Bruce.

704
00:31:00,586 --> 00:31:03,000
Bruce came up to Jake yesterday

705
00:31:03,103 --> 00:31:06,172
and told Jake that
he had given Kellie his idol

706
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:07,931
to hold on to
for Knowledge Is Power.

707
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,689
-Oh, it's, it's a lie.
-Yeah?

708
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:11,379
-You know for sure?
-Yeah, because he told Katurah

709
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:12,896
that he was gonna say that

710
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,862
to try to convince people
that he didn't have his idol.

711
00:31:15,965 --> 00:31:17,862
-Great. Great.
-Yeah. So it's 100% a lie.

712
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:21,034
So ideally, Bruce and Jake--
neither win immunity.

713
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:22,172
If Bruce wins immunity,

714
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:23,620
-we just take out Jake.
-Yeah.

715
00:31:23,724 --> 00:31:24,965
That's how
I would like it to go.

716
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:26,310
Me, too.

717
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:28,275
If Bruce loses
the immunity challenge,

718
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:29,620
he's going to play his idol,

719
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:31,517
and it's probably
gonna cause Jake to go home.

720
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,103
Everybody has been
kind of lying to Jake

721
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:34,620
for a long time now.

722
00:31:34,724 --> 00:31:36,620
And I've done my best
to be honest with him,

723
00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:37,931
because
if he is sitting on the jury,

724
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:39,206
I want him
to have some respect for me--

725
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,620
that I was
talking to him like a human

726
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:41,862
and not just
like a chess piece.

727
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:43,965
If Bruce plays his idol...

728
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:46,413
Okay. Let's...

729
00:31:49,137 --> 00:31:50,862
Well, like...

730
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:52,724
Everybody?

731
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:57,344
-Is that surprising to you?
-A little bit, yeah.

732
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,448
Mm-hmm.

733
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:05,724
Um, I'm in a decent spot
in this game right now,

734
00:32:05,827 --> 00:32:07,793
and if I do that,
I blow up my spot,

735
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:10,379
-like, oh, by a lot.
-Yeah.

736
00:32:10,482 --> 00:32:11,551
So that sucks.

737
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:12,758
I'm sick
of being the backup target.

738
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:13,862
I don't want
to be the backup target.

739
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,448
You don't want to be that

740
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:17,551
in this game, and
I'm a little pissed about Drew

741
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:19,551
'cause this whole game,

742
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:21,344
he's been feeding me M&Ms,

743
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:22,793
trying to string me along.

744
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:25,206
But he doesn't care
if I'm the backup vote,

745
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,551
so I don't care
if he's the vote.

746
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,034
There are bigger threats
in this game than me.

747
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:30,241
-Like Drew.

748
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:32,137
If you want to do something,
like, we can do something.

749
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,551
Yup, yup.
I got to go on the... I...

750
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:35,310
Yeah, yeah. No, I know, I know.

751
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,758
So I pitched Drew's name.

752
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:38,448
Everyone's kind of
giving me the runaround.

753
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:41,206
It really sucks,
but I'm ready to do something.

754
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,965
Everyone else here is ready
to sit on their hands

755
00:32:43,068 --> 00:32:44,586
and do nothing,

756
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:46,758
or they're not ready
to do it with me.

757
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:49,034
Jake was trying to get me
to go in with him

758
00:32:49,137 --> 00:32:50,275
on numbers.

759
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:52,137
Yes.

760
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:54,172
-Really? All right.
-How you feeling?

761
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:56,103
I'm not nervous.
I trust you all.

762
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:58,000
-All right, well...
-So, you're the name
that he's doing.

763
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:00,448
Well, I think he was the...
I'm the last-ditch effort.

764
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:02,827
Jake has been throwing my name
out there, and I'm indignant

765
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:04,586
because he was going to go.

766
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:06,620
And I said,
"No, let it be Kellie."

767
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:08,241
He was going to go.
I said, "Let it be Kendra."

768
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:09,793
And so for him
to throw my name out there

769
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:11,586
is a slap in the face.

770
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,000
Why me?
I don't understand.

771
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:15,689
Wait. So you don't care
if I catch a stray bullet,

772
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,344
but I got to care if you do?

773
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:19,275
-I just wonder, "Why me?"
-Why not?

774
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:21,310
-Island full of people.
-Yeah, but why me?

775
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:23,793
Because
you don't have any allies.

776
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:26,103
I mean, I'm the only person
who's been batting for you.

777
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:27,206
Drew's mad 'cause
I said his name.

778
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,655
He wants to feel like,

779
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,344
"I've kept you in this game."
No, dude.

780
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:31,689
There's other people
looking out for me.

781
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:33,862
You are not a gift from God.
Relax.

782
00:33:33,965 --> 00:33:35,620
-Sucks hearing your name?
-Yeah, of course it does.

783
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,793
And who did you talk to?

784
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:39,137
Who?

785
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:41,172
I think our conversation's done.

786
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:42,931
-Ours is?
-Yeah.

787
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:45,862
All right, all right. All right,
mobster, go have fun with it.

788
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:47,862
"Oh, you want information
fromme now?

789
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:51,172
Oh, that's funny, Drew, 'cause
I don't want to tell you."

790
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:54,137
Dude, I'm on the bottom.
How am I the mobster?

791
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,724
-How am I in charge?
-Because you're like,

792
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,344
"Our conversation is done."
Like, okay, like, all right.

793
00:33:57,448 --> 00:33:58,689
What do you want to say
to me, Drew?

794
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:00,000
You're not...
You can't help me.

795
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:01,689
Are you for real, dude?

796
00:34:01,793 --> 00:34:03,517
He thinks he's the big
Boston mobster ofThe Departed.

797
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,068
You gonna like, gonna, you know,
"This conversation's over."

798
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:08,620
So I'm like,
"Get out of here, dude.

799
00:34:08,724 --> 00:34:12,034
You're a goon.
Your game is dunzo."

800
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:25,862
Bring in the boat.

801
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:36,034
Not a bad way
to arrive to a challenge.

802
00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:38,482
-No, definitely not.
-Not at all.

803
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,862
Come on.

804
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:44,034
Oh, no.

805
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:50,068
What?

806
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,447
Oh, man.

807
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:55,137
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

808
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:58,206
-For the second time, Bruce,

809
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,793
I'm gonna take it back.

810
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:03,275
Thank you.

811
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:09,206
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

812
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,586
For today's challenge,
you're going to lie

813
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:14,482
on a steep ramp
suspended over water.

814
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:17,206
You're going
to hold yourself there

815
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,931
by holding on to handholds.

816
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,586
At regular intervals,
you're going to move

817
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:22,206
to smaller handholds...

818
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,413
-Oh.
...making it more difficult.

819
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:27,655
If you drop, you are out.

820
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:31,275
Last person left standing

821
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,620
wins immunity, guaranteed
a spot in the final seven.

822
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:37,517
Losers, after 19 days,

823
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,551
11th person voted out,

824
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:42,413
fourth member of our jury.
Big enough stakes?

825
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,620
-All right, we're going
to draw for spots,

826
00:35:44,724 --> 00:35:47,379
and we will get it on.

827
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:49,931
-Let's go!
Let's go!

828
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,310
All right,
everybody take your spots,

829
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:00,551
maneuver your body.
You're going to be lying

830
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:02,275
on that plank.

831
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:05,172
You're going to go down
to that second set of handholds.

832
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:08,586
Everybody is good,

833
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:12,758
and this challenge is on.

834
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:28,517
It is dead quiet.

835
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:35,068
You'll be in this position
for five minutes.

836
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:38,827
Then we'll move down
to a smaller handhold.

837
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:41,068
It will get more difficult.

838
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:45,206
You're going
to feel it everywhere.

839
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,965
-You're going to feel it

840
00:36:47,068 --> 00:36:49,620
in your hands,
your shoulders, your arms.

841
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:54,965
Everything is very uncomfortable
already.

842
00:36:55,068 --> 00:36:56,931
You can see it.

843
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:03,137
Emily's going to be first out.

844
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:05,551
No shot at immunity.

845
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:08,931
And we are down to seven.

846
00:37:15,827 --> 00:37:17,862
How you doing, Katurah?

847
00:37:18,896 --> 00:37:21,482
I just think
I'm too in my head right now.

848
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:24,103
-About the water?
-Yeah.

849
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:26,172
Katurah,
the ladder's right here.

850
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,724
Ooh. Ooh.

851
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:32,862
You got this.

852
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:36,172
And if we drop,
is somebody around?

853
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:39,448
We have safety swimmers
in the water, I'm here,

854
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:40,896
and a ladder's right here.

855
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:46,586
Ooh.

856
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:48,689
Katurah, if you want

857
00:37:48,793 --> 00:37:50,068
to let go, we got you.

858
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,517
-I'd like to.
Okay. You do you.

859
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,931
-Hey, go ahead and do it...
-Can somebody be here?

860
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,000
Let go, slide down
and get right over here.

861
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:58,517
Take care of yourself.

862
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,758
Let go and start swimming.
-I'm dropping.

863
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,758
Drop and start swimming
toward me immediately.

864
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,206
-Ready?

865
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,034
-Come on, you got it, kid.
Just go. Just go.

866
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:10,275
If you can maneuver your body
to get off, just get off.

867
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:12,827
-Okay.
Water's not a part
of the test.

868
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:15,034
It's up to you.

869
00:38:16,103 --> 00:38:18,000
I don't know why.
I'm so sorry, guys. So sorry.

870
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:19,517
You're perfect.
Don't worry about a thing.

871
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,241
No sorrys, Katurah.

872
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:24,034
Come over here. Emily,
you want to give her a hand?

873
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:37,413
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

874
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:39,827
All right, Katurah is out.

875
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:41,758
We are down to six.

876
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:46,620
Jake trying to stay in.

877
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,517
Use those feet as a wedge.
That'll help.

878
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,862
Does not have to be pretty.

879
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:56,689
Only thing that matters
is staying up there.

880
00:38:57,724 --> 00:38:59,862
All right, in a moment,
you're going to move down

881
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,724
to the third handhold.

882
00:39:01,827 --> 00:39:03,931
Here we go.

883
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:05,655
Start making that move.

884
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:15,000
Everybody has moved down
to the next smaller handhold.

885
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,551
And you're still in it.
Everybody's good.

886
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:21,413
Now it's getting
even more difficult.

887
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:25,310
Sorry, guys. I'm out.

888
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:27,793
Julie drops, and we're down

889
00:39:27,896 --> 00:39:31,793
to five, fighting for immunity.

890
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:33,965
-Good job, Julie.
This challenge

891
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:35,448
will sneak up on you.

892
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:44,655
Don't lose your focus.

893
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:47,275
Channel whatever you need to.

894
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:50,137
This is kind of

895
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:53,931
a fun challenge
you might do at a carnival

896
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:56,827
for laughs
while you're having a scone.

897
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:59,655
-What carnival
have you seen this at?
Yeah.

898
00:39:59,758 --> 00:40:01,931
I don't think
anyone does this for fun.

899
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:08,413
It is Drew, Jake,

900
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:10,689
Dee, Austin

901
00:40:10,793 --> 00:40:13,034
and Bruce...

902
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:15,068
lying on a ramp of wood

903
00:40:15,172 --> 00:40:17,103
over the ocean in Fiji

904
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,000
with a million dollars
on the line.

905
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:25,379
All right, in a moment,
you're going to move down

906
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:27,413
to the next handhold.

907
00:40:29,413 --> 00:40:31,241
And what you're going to do is--
those feet,

908
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:33,241
which you've been using
as a wedge--

909
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:35,000
your legs got to go flat out.

910
00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:39,172
That's going to remove a lot
of your leverage.

911
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:41,034
This is your last move.

912
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:42,862
Here we go.

913
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:44,862
Begin your move.
This is a live transition.

914
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:48,000
You got to get down
to the next smaller handholds.

915
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:54,793
And now, legs out, everybody.

916
00:40:56,586 --> 00:41:00,241
It just got a lot harder.

917
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:04,275
Let's go, Dee.
You got to move.

918
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:09,965
Great job! Wow!
Well done. We're in

919
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,827
-the last phase
of this challenge now.
-That's amazing.

920
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:14,448
-Whoo!
This is it.

921
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:16,689
Good job, boys.

922
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:20,517
Dee is out immediately.
We're down to four.

923
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,206
-Good job, Dee.
Good job, Dee.
Good job, Dee.

924
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,172
It is Drew, Jake,

925
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:26,448
Austin and Bruce.

926
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:29,827
You want to be safe tonight,

927
00:41:29,931 --> 00:41:32,724
guarantee yourself a spot
at seven.

928
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:34,517
Don't drop, Jake!

929
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,965
Nah, man.

930
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:39,517
Hold it!

931
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,310
Okay.

932
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:44,827
Aah!
-Drew drops out of nowhere.

933
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:46,482
And we're down to three.

934
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:49,862
It is Jake, Austin and Bruce.

935
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,275
That's how quickly it can end.

936
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:54,310
Bruce now starting
to move a little.

937
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:55,862
Jake still struggling.

938
00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:59,206
Hold tight.

939
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,724
And once again recovers.

940
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:03,931
That's the grit
right there, Jake.

941
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:05,551
Y'all are killing it.
That's why

942
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:07,413
you keep digging.
You don't know

943
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:10,931
when the other player or players
are about to drop.

944
00:42:11,034 --> 00:42:13,655
Hold on!
Hold tight!
You got this!

945
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:20,068
Jake drops. We got a showdown.

946
00:42:20,172 --> 00:42:22,931
-It is Austin versus Bruce.
Good job, Jake.
Good job, guys.

947
00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:24,931
Bruce has won it twice.

948
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:26,551
Austin has never won it.

949
00:42:26,655 --> 00:42:28,862
Will history repeat,

950
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:33,000
or will Austin have immunity
for the first time this season?

951
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:37,034
Austin looking very calm,
but looks can be deceiving.

952
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:42,379
You got it.
Bruce looking
at Austin,

953
00:42:42,482 --> 00:42:43,965
looking for a sign.

954
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:47,965
It would be Bruce's
third win in a row.

955
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:54,172
Both guys digging.

956
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,655
Somebody gonna have
that necklace tonight.

957
00:42:57,758 --> 00:42:59,862
Let's go.

958
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,172
Bruce drops. It's over.

959
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:10,206
Austin wins

960
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,137
individual immunity.

961
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:15,862
Safe tonight at Tribal Council,
guaranteed a spot

962
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:17,448
in the final seven.

963
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:20,103
Another epic showdown.

964
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,689
Austin, come on over.

965
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:31,827
Yeah, Austin.
-Well earned.

966
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:33,310
Thank you.

967
00:43:35,137 --> 00:43:36,724
-Austin,

968
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:39,137
safe tonight at Tribal Council,

969
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,000
cannot be voted out
of this game,

970
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:43,379
guaranteed a spot
in the final seven.

971
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:47,137
As for the rest of you,
after 19 tough days,

972
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:48,689
somebody going home tonight.

973
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,896
11th person voted out,
fourth member of our jury.

974
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,379
You have the afternoon to figure
out who that's going to be.

975
00:43:53,482 --> 00:43:55,034
Grab your stuff, swim out.

976
00:43:57,482 --> 00:43:59,758
-Katurah, I have a question.
-Oh, God.

977
00:43:59,862 --> 00:44:02,137
The tradition
in a water challenge...

978
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:03,965
-Yes, I know.
-...is to dive in

979
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:05,965
-and celebrate
and swim over to your boat.
-I know.

980
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:07,655
You clearly don't like
being in the water.

981
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:11,068
I like being in the water.
I prepared for this moment.

982
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:15,620
I saw the challenge, and
my hands just started shaking.

983
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:18,896
:
I don't know. Something just...

984
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:21,551
I don't know.

985
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:23,931
So you have the option.
Everybody else

986
00:44:24,034 --> 00:44:25,310
is going to jump in
and swim over.

987
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,068
We'll bring the boat to you, or

988
00:44:27,172 --> 00:44:29,655
if you want
to just take this opportunity,

989
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:32,275
surrounded by your Tribemates,
to give it a go,

990
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:33,793
you can give it a go.

991
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:36,379
Whatever you want to do.
-There's no pressure.

992
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:39,275
Yeah, there's no pressure.
This is just if you want to.

993
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:41,137
All right, let's do it.

994
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,034
I'll see everybody tonight
at Tribal.

995
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:48,379
-Let's do it. Let's do it.
-Aah!

996
00:44:48,482 --> 00:44:50,586
I cannot explain it.

997
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,068
: I would never
step out of a challenge.

998
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:54,379
It's just...
I would never do it.

999
00:44:56,517 --> 00:44:58,344
Maybe I can just
appreciate the joy of, like,

1000
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:00,000
a lot of people being like,

1001
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:03,517
"We're just here with you.
We're with you the whole way."

1002
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,275
-Three, two, one.

1003
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:11,586
It was really beautiful,

1004
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:13,379
and I...
I deeply appreciated it.

1005
00:45:13,482 --> 00:45:15,586
Nice work, Katurah!

1006
00:45:28,137 --> 00:45:30,000
Well done.
Thank you.

1007
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,448
Good job, Austin.

1008
00:45:31,551 --> 00:45:34,275
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you. Thank you.

1009
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:36,137
-Oh, my gosh.
That was really inspiring.

1010
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:37,931
That was
an incredible showdown.
-You pushed me so freaking hard.

1011
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,344
This is my first time

1012
00:45:40,448 --> 00:45:43,413
not getting the necklace,
but it was okay. I have an idol.

1013
00:45:43,517 --> 00:45:44,862
I'm gonna play it.
I'm gonna be safe.

1014
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:46,517
No votes cast against Bruce
is gonna count.

1015
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,034
Tonight's going to be fun.

1016
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:49,275
Honestly, I feel like
you're probably going to have

1017
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,068
to play the idol tonight.

1018
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:52,724
That is correct.

1019
00:45:52,827 --> 00:45:54,551
I think every single person here
knows that I have an idol.

1020
00:45:54,655 --> 00:45:56,551
I got to do it.
I got to play it.

1021
00:45:56,655 --> 00:45:58,241
I don't want to be the guy
who's gonna be sitting here

1022
00:45:58,344 --> 00:46:01,517
holding hidden immunity idol,
and I get voted off.

1023
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,000
It's going to come down
to the ricochet.

1024
00:46:03,103 --> 00:46:04,793
-It is.
Exactly.

1025
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:06,965
The easy one is Jake.

1026
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:08,448
-I'm ready for Jake, y'all.
Yeah?

1027
00:46:08,551 --> 00:46:10,172
I feel like I've been so good,
and I've been waiting.

1028
00:46:11,206 --> 00:46:12,586
Okay.

1029
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:15,068
I want to get Bruce out
or Jake out,

1030
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,896
but Bruce is going
to play his idol tonight.

1031
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,862
So, Jake's the ricochet.
I'm still mad he voted for me.

1032
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:23,655
Dude, I'm writing
Jake's name down. He's gone.

1033
00:46:23,758 --> 00:46:25,241
-Okay, what do you...?
-I would like to do
a Bruce idol flush.

1034
00:46:25,344 --> 00:46:27,206
-Oh, yeah...
-Yeah.

1035
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,655
-Bruce is going
to play his idol 100%.
Of course. Yes.

1036
00:46:28,758 --> 00:46:29,862
And Jake still goes home.

1037
00:46:29,965 --> 00:46:31,172
Obviously, we're going

1038
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:32,896
to split votes
between Jake and Bruce.

1039
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,241
They're huge threats
for my alliance members.

1040
00:46:35,344 --> 00:46:37,344
And we've been pretty much
dominating together.

1041
00:46:37,448 --> 00:46:39,206
If we hear names,
we go after them.

1042
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,965
I just think getting Jake out
is a wasted vote,

1043
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:45,551
and I think you cannot go
to the final three

1044
00:46:45,655 --> 00:46:48,413
with anybody
who people call "Mama."

1045
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:51,724
Who do you love more
than anybody in the whole world?

1046
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:53,379
-Your mama. Yeah.
-Your mama.

1047
00:46:53,482 --> 00:46:56,689
And Julie has been so warm.
I mean, just listening

1048
00:46:56,793 --> 00:46:58,137
to how people talk about her,
and, like...

1049
00:46:58,241 --> 00:46:59,551
-Everybody loves her, right?
-Yeah.

1050
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,206
-She's impossible not to.
-Exactly.

1051
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,000
Deep down, I'm seething
and ready for Bruce to go,

1052
00:47:04,103 --> 00:47:06,103
but he has that damn idol,

1053
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:09,275
so I want Julie
to be the backup.

1054
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:11,206
Like, we're calling Julie "Mama"
'cause we love her.

1055
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,448
And, heck,
I love Julie so deeply

1056
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:15,137
that I would give Julie
a million dollars.

1057
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:17,517
This is such a sick,
twisted, disgusting,

1058
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,931
ridiculously delicious,
enjoyable, terrifying game.

1059
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:24,172
She's super strategic,
she's in with the Reba people.

1060
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,689
Bruce is super close to her,
and everybody loved her.

1061
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:28,724
That makes her super dangerous.

1062
00:47:28,827 --> 00:47:30,586
-I hate to be the one
to tell you this.
-I... What's up?

1063
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,068
-Really?
-No, not with you.

1064
00:47:34,172 --> 00:47:36,724
I'm sorry. It's like Kellie.
She wants your jury vote.

1065
00:47:36,827 --> 00:47:38,586
And that's why
she's being nice to you.

1066
00:47:39,586 --> 00:47:41,517
I'm so sorry.

1067
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,172
-No, listen. Hey.
-Please don't tell her
I told you that.

1068
00:47:43,275 --> 00:47:46,620
No, no, no, no, no, I don't
really give two poops about it.

1069
00:47:46,724 --> 00:47:48,758
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Because I'm playing an idol
tonight.

1070
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:52,172
Yeah, so, me, you,
Katurah, Jake...

1071
00:47:53,344 --> 00:47:54,758
I mean, you tell me. I...

1072
00:47:54,862 --> 00:47:56,275
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1073
00:47:56,379 --> 00:47:59,310
If we take this shot at Mama J,
we cannot miss.

1074
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,689
So I need to be 100% solid.

1075
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:04,655
You have me at 110%.
I'm going to talk to Jake.

1076
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:07,931
I'm trying to stress to Bruce,
"Let's make

1077
00:48:08,034 --> 00:48:09,517
this big move
and take Mama J out."

1078
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,862
The truth is,

1079
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:12,862
I am lying straight
to Bruce's face.

1080
00:48:12,965 --> 00:48:14,793
If I can appeal to Bruce's ego,

1081
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:17,517
outsmart him a little bit,
outwit him a little bit,

1082
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,137
then it's possible
that he doesn't play

1083
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:21,896
his idol tonight, and he goes
home with an idol in his pocket.

1084
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,517
It's just, the onus is on me.

1085
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,862
As much as I'm, like,
for putting out Mama J's name

1086
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:27,517
for this vote just to get,
like, potentially

1087
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,000
-Bruce's idol flushed...
-Mm-hmm.

1088
00:48:29,103 --> 00:48:30,344
...I am 100% serious
about her being a real threat.

1089
00:48:30,448 --> 00:48:31,689
Perfect. Yeah.

1090
00:48:31,793 --> 00:48:34,068
I doubt Bruce falls for it, but

1091
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:36,689
if Bruce doesn't play his idol
tonight, Bruce is going home.

1092
00:48:36,793 --> 00:48:38,137
Here's what we got.

1093
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:40,103
-Lots of votes are going
to be split.
-Yeah.

1094
00:48:40,206 --> 00:48:43,137
Three for you, three for me,
and then... Ugh!

1095
00:48:43,241 --> 00:48:44,965
-Whatever else happens.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1096
00:48:45,068 --> 00:48:48,448
Hands-- like, two groups,
Rebas, everybody else.

1097
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,655
"Bye, Jake. Bye, Bruce."

1098
00:48:51,758 --> 00:48:53,137
-Here they are.
-Yeah.

1099
00:48:55,586 --> 00:48:57,379
Here's the deal. We walk
back over there right now,

1100
00:48:57,482 --> 00:48:59,344
we come up with no plan, you're
going home tonight. That's...

1101
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:01,172
-Right, right, right, right.
-There's no getting around that.

1102
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:02,931
-Do you want to go home?
I don't want you to go home.
-No. No. Okay.

1103
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:05,827
You are good for my game,
and I'm good for your game.

1104
00:49:05,931 --> 00:49:07,517
-I do still have an idol.
-Okay.

1105
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,172
I just want to know, why'd
you lie to me about the idol?

1106
00:49:10,275 --> 00:49:12,896
Because I-I... Listen,
this is a game of Survivor.

1107
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,379
You got to be able to play
the game somehow, some way.

1108
00:49:15,482 --> 00:49:17,241
So, Bruce does have his idol.

1109
00:49:17,344 --> 00:49:18,827
Bruce, honestly, man.

1110
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:21,344
It's wicked frustrating
being lied to by Bruce.

1111
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:22,793
I'm sick of it. I've been

1112
00:49:22,896 --> 00:49:27,103
lied to and rope-a-doped
and made to look like

1113
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:28,551
a big fool in this game.

1114
00:49:28,655 --> 00:49:30,896
Bruce said he wants
to vote for Mama J.

1115
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,310
On paper, it's a great plan.
I'm good with anyone but me.

1116
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:36,000
But the problem is,
I don't know who to trust.

1117
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:47,620
I just keep getting lied to.

1118
00:49:47,724 --> 00:49:49,620
I don't feel like
I've had any ground.

1119
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:52,241
I'm at the bottom
every single time.

1120
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:56,137
I've-I've just,
every single vote,

1121
00:49:56,241 --> 00:49:57,620
I'm playing
everyone else's game.

1122
00:49:57,724 --> 00:49:59,103
I'm just trying
to stay alive, and...

1123
00:50:00,827 --> 00:50:02,413
I know it's a game,
and everyone's playing a game,

1124
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:04,482
and I don't take it personally.
It's just...

1125
00:50:05,517 --> 00:50:08,172
It's just like
a disappointment in myself.

1126
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:10,827
You want to come out here
and be better.

1127
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:12,862
You okay?

1128
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:15,068
Dude, I don't know
what's going on, man.

1129
00:50:15,172 --> 00:50:18,551
-I don't know what's going on.
-Okay.

1130
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:20,172
I don't know who's lying to me,
who's telling me the truth.

1131
00:50:20,275 --> 00:50:21,896
-Yeah.
-I don't know what the deal is.

1132
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,758
It's hard to know if people are
lying daily in your face, yeah.

1133
00:50:23,862 --> 00:50:25,103
Yeah, dude, like, it's hard.

1134
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:26,655
Yeah, man. Like, it's just hard.

1135
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:28,758
It is. I got you.

1136
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:31,034
-Okay. I just...
-Don't panic. We can do this.

1137
00:50:31,137 --> 00:50:32,344
-No, I'm not panicking.
-We can do this together.

1138
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:35,137
-Okay.
-Okay, let me get back,

1139
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,758
-'cause I said I was getting
salt water for the rice.
-Yeah, yeah.

1140
00:50:37,862 --> 00:50:39,896
Thank you, Katurah.
I appreciate it.

1141
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:44,103
I'm just having a tough time.
You know what I mean?

1142
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:45,758
-I know. All right, listen.
-I-I'm sorry.

1143
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:48,068
I'm not trying to, like...
I'm-I'm good with the plan.

1144
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:51,275
It's just, I just thought I'd,
like, be better at this game.

1145
00:50:51,379 --> 00:50:53,862
-I just always feel so dumb.
-Look at. Look at. Ready? Ready?

1146
00:50:56,862 --> 00:51:00,000
Don't drop yourself down
to what you're not.

1147
00:51:00,103 --> 00:51:02,034
Look at me.
You know what you just hit?

1148
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:03,931
The Survivorwall.

1149
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:06,413
But congratulations, though.

1150
00:51:06,517 --> 00:51:08,068
You did it longer
than it took me.

1151
00:51:08,172 --> 00:51:10,310
I hit mine, like, four days ago.

1152
00:51:10,413 --> 00:51:11,689
-You're going to look back
at this, I promise you.
-Yeah.

1153
00:51:11,793 --> 00:51:13,068
You're gonna look back
and you're gonna be like,

1154
00:51:13,172 --> 00:51:14,137
"Yeah, I was smarter
than I thought I was."

1155
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:15,482
-All right?
-Yeah.

1156
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:16,931
-Thanks, man.
-All right.

1157
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:19,000
-Love you, brother.
-Love you back.

1158
00:51:19,103 --> 00:51:21,206
I feel for the kid.
I really do.

1159
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,689
He's an extremely smart kid,
but he's got

1160
00:51:23,793 --> 00:51:26,000
to sit there
and realize that himself.

1161
00:51:26,103 --> 00:51:28,000
But here's the rub.

1162
00:51:28,103 --> 00:51:31,413
Jake is the key
to this plan working.

1163
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:33,034
The Reba people tonight--

1164
00:51:33,137 --> 00:51:34,620
they're gonna split
on me and Jake.

1165
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,448
So, there are votes

1166
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,655
that are definitely going
to be cast against myself, but

1167
00:51:39,758 --> 00:51:41,655
if me, Emily, Katurah and Jake

1168
00:51:41,758 --> 00:51:45,241
go in, vote for Mama J,
she's out.

1169
00:51:45,344 --> 00:51:47,137
Once the Reba Four is broken up,
this will

1170
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:49,517
definitely flip the game. This
will turn the game on its head.

1171
00:51:50,689 --> 00:51:52,724
Yeah.

1172
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:57,620
So am I.

1173
00:51:57,724 --> 00:51:59,413
This whole time I've been trying
to manipulate Bruce,

1174
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:01,827
and I think the only way
he doesn't play his idol is

1175
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:03,310
if he feels comfortable enough

1176
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:05,000
that he's not
the person going home.

1177
00:52:14,655 --> 00:52:17,206
This is like a Hail Mary,
but if Bruce does

1178
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,172
play his idol,
there is a question mark

1179
00:52:19,275 --> 00:52:21,137
about who is going
to be the person voted out,

1180
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:24,137
you know, the backup target,
and Mama J is a massive threat.

1181
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,137
I do think,

1182
00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:27,724
if you're going to the end
with someone like Mama J,

1183
00:52:27,827 --> 00:52:29,034
you just have
to be prepared to lose.

1184
00:52:29,137 --> 00:52:31,000
And then
you have Jake on the outs.

1185
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,482
Jake has been on
the chopping block for a while

1186
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:34,103
as potentially an easy vote,

1187
00:52:34,206 --> 00:52:36,172
and he seems
to be the safer option.

1188
00:52:36,275 --> 00:52:37,896
Full moon out tonight.
Things are getting weird.

1189
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,551
But I really don't like the idea

1190
00:52:39,655 --> 00:52:42,482
of Bruce being here another week
with that idol sitting around.

1191
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:47,482
Everybody agrees.
Now we want Bruce to be gone.

1192
00:52:47,586 --> 00:52:48,827
By some miracle,
if he does not play

1193
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:50,275
his idol tonight
and he goes home,

1194
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:53,103
everybody says, "Wow.
Look what Emily pulled off."

1195
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,275
-All right.

1196
00:53:27,793 --> 00:53:30,034
Something feels different,

1197
00:53:30,137 --> 00:53:31,758
or am I crazy?

1198
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:33,137
What's different, Emily?

1199
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:34,620
No, I don't think you're crazy.

1200
00:53:34,724 --> 00:53:36,034
I think we've had a couple

1201
00:53:36,137 --> 00:53:37,758
Tribal Councils now
where one person

1202
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:40,758
has been wearing a certain kind
of necklace, and now

1203
00:53:40,862 --> 00:53:42,827
that necklace is on a different
person. I think the energy

1204
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,103
might be a little different
because of that.

1205
00:53:44,206 --> 00:53:46,344
Well, that's very direct, Bruce.

1206
00:53:46,448 --> 00:53:49,137
-Very much so. That's okay.

1207
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,482
So as Emily noted,
first time in a couple

1208
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:53,689
of Tribals,
you don't have the necklace.

1209
00:53:53,793 --> 00:53:56,655
-Yeah.
-How is that different
for you today?

1210
00:53:56,758 --> 00:53:59,931
It's different for me
because I'm looked at

1211
00:54:00,034 --> 00:54:02,862
a heck of a lot harder now
than everybody else.

1212
00:54:02,965 --> 00:54:05,275
And I know where I stand with
everyone, so I need to be able

1213
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:07,000
to do the things
that I need to do to...

1214
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,586
to ensure
that I'm here another day.

1215
00:54:08,689 --> 00:54:11,172
Jake, did you feel
a different energy today?

1216
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:13,137
I felt a different energy today.
I feel like

1217
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:16,103
I have been approached more
than I have

1218
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:18,827
in, like, at least the past
couple days, so that's...

1219
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:20,758
-That's got to feel good.
-Yeah. You know,

1220
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:23,620
not to be the tribe pariah is,

1221
00:54:23,724 --> 00:54:25,758
you know,
nicer than being the pariah.

1222
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,172
Is that really how you felt,

1223
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:30,034
just because
your name has come up?

1224
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:31,551
Just not being in the know,
not knowing,

1225
00:54:31,655 --> 00:54:33,172
not knowing, not knowing.

1226
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:34,655
It's just, that's...
that's tough.

1227
00:54:34,758 --> 00:54:37,103
It kind of calls upon,

1228
00:54:37,206 --> 00:54:39,551
like, a lot of, like,
insecurity and stuff,

1229
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:42,310
'cause, like, I mean,
everyone has insecurities.

1230
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:44,172
I have a lot of insecurity.
I think, like,

1231
00:54:44,275 --> 00:54:45,758
at least with, like, lawyers,

1232
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:48,034
there's a lot
of impostor syndrome out there.

1233
00:54:48,137 --> 00:54:50,655
There's always like,
"Am I smart enough?

1234
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:52,379
Am I working hard enough?"

1235
00:54:52,482 --> 00:54:53,965
So, when you feel like
you're on the outs,

1236
00:54:54,068 --> 00:54:55,275
it weighs a little bit on you.

1237
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:56,620
I'd be lying
if I said it didn't.

1238
00:54:56,724 --> 00:54:59,862
Austin, it's hard
to not take it personally

1239
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:01,448
when they write your name down.

1240
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:03,137
It's got to sting a little bit.

1241
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:05,034
Yeah. I mean,

1242
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:06,655
on one hand, you know,

1243
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:08,931
you hate to hurt people
at a personal level,

1244
00:55:09,034 --> 00:55:10,379
and you never want to do that.

1245
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:12,344
But on the other hand,
there's a million dollars,

1246
00:55:12,448 --> 00:55:15,310
and someone not knowing a piece
of information could be

1247
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:17,344
the difference between getting
that and not getting that.

1248
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:18,965
Sorry. I don't believe
it's a personal thing

1249
00:55:19,068 --> 00:55:22,034
from anybody. I just want
to get that out there right now.

1250
00:55:22,137 --> 00:55:23,344
I'm not trying
to say it's a personal thing.

1251
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:25,413
But it does play into, like,

1252
00:55:25,517 --> 00:55:27,551
"Man, I'm missing stuff, man.

1253
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:29,137
"Things are getting
over my head,

1254
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:31,137
and, like, I just feel dumb."

1255
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:32,965
You know what I mean?

1256
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:35,655
I appreciate you sharing
that because you were not

1257
00:55:35,758 --> 00:55:37,206
the first person
to be out of the loop.

1258
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,517
-Yeah.
-You're not
the only person tonight

1259
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,137
who's probably out of the loop.
You're not dumb.

1260
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:43,586
You're just playing
a very difficult game

1261
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:46,379
where withholding information
is job number one.

1262
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:48,206
Right. I know that,
like, in my head,

1263
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,965
but sometimes
the feeling's still hard.

1264
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:54,448
Julie, Jake is saying,
"Huh. You know, I have times

1265
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,275
"where I feel like I'm out
of the loop, people are lying.

1266
00:55:56,379 --> 00:55:57,827
-I wonder if I'm getting it."
Yes.

1267
00:55:57,931 --> 00:56:00,344
On the flip side,
they call you "Mama J."

1268
00:56:00,448 --> 00:56:03,310
-They've anointed you
as the mom of this group.
-Yeah.

1269
00:56:03,413 --> 00:56:06,034
That's a beautiful gesture until

1270
00:56:06,137 --> 00:56:08,137
-it's threatening.
Yeah, but

1271
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:10,379
it's also terrible

1272
00:56:10,482 --> 00:56:15,068
for me personally
when you then lie to someone,

1273
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:18,068
um, and I felt terrible
after Kendra.

1274
00:56:18,172 --> 00:56:20,413
Like, I can't even look over
at the jury.

1275
00:56:21,551 --> 00:56:23,034
:
Um...

1276
00:56:23,137 --> 00:56:26,448
Because I feel like
there was an extra bit of,

1277
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,758
"No, I trusted you.
You were Mama J."

1278
00:56:28,862 --> 00:56:31,896
So then that feels
like an extra burden.

1279
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,103
So I'm having my own
crisis of faith,

1280
00:56:35,206 --> 00:56:37,965
-just with that name.
But I will say,

1281
00:56:38,068 --> 00:56:39,896
there's benefits
to being Mama J, I think.

1282
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,379
-There's benefits that...
-I got to go to the sanctuary.

1283
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:43,586
...that Julie has experienced.
This is one

1284
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:45,689
of the drawbacks,
and that's true for anybody.

1285
00:56:45,793 --> 00:56:47,310
You know, somebody
that we are close with,

1286
00:56:47,413 --> 00:56:49,482
we are going to have
to lie to and vote out,

1287
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:51,551
and it's going to be painful.

1288
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:54,137
So, Drew, when you walked in,

1289
00:56:54,241 --> 00:56:55,655
I said
I felt a different energy.

1290
00:56:55,758 --> 00:56:57,517
What was it like at camp today?
Was it different

1291
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,482
-in terms of the discussions
that went on?
-Absolutely, Jeff.

1292
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:03,586
The merge so far
has been defined by steamrolls.

1293
00:57:03,689 --> 00:57:06,275
There was a target, and they
were tied to the train tracks,

1294
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:08,034
and the train came
and, you know, drove over them.

1295
00:57:08,137 --> 00:57:11,448
Today the vote is a little bit
more logistical, and I think

1296
00:57:11,551 --> 00:57:14,965
it resulted in a little bit
more ambiguity around camp.

1297
00:57:15,068 --> 00:57:17,172
Bruce, do you agree
with what Drew said?

1298
00:57:17,275 --> 00:57:18,724
Much more complicated today?

1299
00:57:18,827 --> 00:57:20,482
Much, much more complicated
today.

1300
00:57:20,586 --> 00:57:22,413
You know, you can try
to see through certain words

1301
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:23,862
that people are saying.

1302
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:25,896
Even here now,
when people are talking,

1303
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,103
you try to see
through these words.

1304
00:57:28,206 --> 00:57:29,896
Is it something that is
meaningful that could either

1305
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,034
affect now or later on
in the game?

1306
00:57:32,137 --> 00:57:33,965
Katurah, did you feel

1307
00:57:34,068 --> 00:57:36,206
the intensity
that Drew spoke about?

1308
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,689
It's exactly
as everybody has said.

1309
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:40,103
We see the jury getting bigger,

1310
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,965
we feel our numbers
getting smaller,

1311
00:57:42,068 --> 00:57:43,793
and the tension is intense.

1312
00:57:43,896 --> 00:57:46,655
We also have potential
advantages and idols in play,

1313
00:57:46,758 --> 00:57:49,586
and so you're starting
to feel that pressure and think,

1314
00:57:49,689 --> 00:57:51,482
"Okay, wow, I got to put my foot
on the gas pedal now

1315
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:54,068
because this game is moving
with or without me."

1316
00:57:54,172 --> 00:57:56,413
Big statement, Emily.
Yeah.

1317
00:57:56,517 --> 00:57:58,965
And I will say this. When
you get down to eight people,

1318
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:00,965
this is the time
for a move, right?

1319
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:02,896
And I suspect
the power dynamics are going

1320
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,827
to shift after tonight's vote.

1321
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:06,724
So, Jake, is that good for you,

1322
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:09,448
or are you just as uncomfortable
as you've ever been?

1323
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:11,448
Look, let's do something.
Like, I'm here.

1324
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:13,965
You want to vote? You want
to sucker punch someone?

1325
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:15,344
Like, let's go.
You know what mean? Like,

1326
00:58:15,448 --> 00:58:16,793
that's kind of what the game is.
Like,

1327
00:58:16,896 --> 00:58:18,068
-I'm here.
That'll get rid

1328
00:58:18,172 --> 00:58:19,482
-of the impostor syndrome.
-Yeah. Right?

1329
00:58:20,793 --> 00:58:23,310
Maybe. Fingers crossed, right?

1330
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:26,482
Julie, would you be
a little surprised

1331
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,689
if it was you tonight?

1332
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:29,413
I would.

1333
00:58:29,517 --> 00:58:32,413
Yeah, based on the conversations
that I've had.

1334
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:34,206
Austin, Katurah mentioned

1335
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,965
advantages and idols.

1336
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:38,413
How much talk is there
about if people have them,

1337
00:58:38,517 --> 00:58:40,344
if so, who?

1338
00:58:40,448 --> 00:58:42,241
Yeah. A ton, and I think,

1339
00:58:42,344 --> 00:58:45,034
you know, this Tribal Council,
one's going to be played,

1340
00:58:45,137 --> 00:58:46,689
and I'm glad to be safe today.

1341
00:58:46,793 --> 00:58:49,068
Julie, you're smiling.

1342
00:58:49,172 --> 00:58:51,103
I think one will be played.

1343
00:58:51,206 --> 00:58:53,206
Drew,

1344
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,206
do you think
one will be played?

1345
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:57,241
-Indubitably, Jeff. Indubitably.
So there's one thing

1346
00:58:57,344 --> 00:59:00,241
-you all seem unanimous about.
Yeah, we all do.

1347
00:59:00,344 --> 00:59:02,827
Does that mean
everybody knows who has it?

1348
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:06,724
-Brucey. Bruseph.
-Brucey?

1349
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:09,000
So, Bruce.
-Yes, sir.

1350
00:59:09,103 --> 00:59:10,689
-There is speculation...
-There is.

1351
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:12,413
...that you have an idol,
and that

1352
00:59:12,517 --> 00:59:14,068
-you are going
to play it tonight.
-That is correct.

1353
00:59:14,172 --> 00:59:15,758
Whatever I can do
to keep myself safe

1354
00:59:15,862 --> 00:59:18,068
in this game--
that's how it's gonna work.

1355
00:59:18,172 --> 00:59:20,103
And, Emily, what's interesting
about that is,

1356
00:59:20,206 --> 00:59:21,793
that doesn't mean
he's going to play it.

1357
00:59:21,896 --> 00:59:23,551
Yeah, that's-that's true, right?

1358
00:59:23,655 --> 00:59:25,655
Bruce could not play his idol

1359
00:59:25,758 --> 00:59:28,344
if he's confident in whatever
it is that he thinks is going

1360
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:30,275
to happen tonight, but

1361
00:59:30,379 --> 00:59:32,241
I would be surprised
if that were to happen.

1362
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:33,724
I think everybody here
would be surprised.

1363
00:59:33,827 --> 00:59:35,172
I think Bruce has made
his intentions really clear.

1364
00:59:36,758 --> 00:59:38,172
All right.

1365
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:42,000
It is time to vote.
Dee, you're up.

1366
00:59:50,413 --> 00:59:52,758
Third try's the charm.

1367
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,172
I'll go tally the votes.

1368
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:44,172
If anybody has an advantage

1369
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:45,862
or an idol,
and you want to play it,

1370
01:00:45,965 --> 01:00:49,034
now would be the time to do so.

1371
01:01:06,931 --> 01:01:09,724
Okay, I'll read the votes.

1372
01:01:16,103 --> 01:01:19,413
First vote: Jake.

1373
01:01:23,965 --> 01:01:25,482
Jake.
Two votes Jake.

1374
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,931
Jake. Three votes Jake.

1375
01:01:40,586 --> 01:01:41,965
Julie.

1376
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:44,310
That's three votes Jake,
one vote Julie.

1377
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,896
Bruce.
That's three votes Jake,

1378
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,724
one vote Julie,
one vote Bruce.

1379
01:01:58,344 --> 01:02:01,758
Bruce. That's three votes
Jake, two votes Bruce,

1380
01:02:01,862 --> 01:02:03,172
one vote Julie.

1381
01:02:05,758 --> 01:02:07,034
Bruce.
We're tied.

1382
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:09,310
Three votes Jake,
three votes Bruce,

1383
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:11,689
one vote Julie, one vote left.

1384
01:02:15,206 --> 01:02:17,655
11th person voted out and
the fourth member of our jury:

1385
01:02:17,758 --> 01:02:20,931
Bruce.
Need to bring me your torch.

1386
01:02:22,931 --> 01:02:24,206
Good game.

1387
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,827
-Aah!
-Good game, old man.

1388
01:02:36,206 --> 01:02:37,689
Playing this game
with you guys--

1389
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:39,896
it has been an honor
my second time back.

1390
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,517
Honestly, I appreciate you.

1391
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,896
-Love you, Bruce.
-I love you back.

1392
01:02:46,827 --> 01:02:48,827
Bruce,

1393
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,275
-the tribe has spoken.
-Yes, sir.

1394
01:02:52,172 --> 01:02:54,068
Time for you to go.

1395
01:03:14,896 --> 01:03:16,724
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

1396
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:18,172
Good night.

At this point,
every move we make is gonna

1401
01:03:43,896 --> 01:03:45,103
hurt a lot.

1402
01:03:45,206 --> 01:03:47,310
Next time onSurvivor...

1403
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,172
I'm ready to take some shots.

1404
01:03:51,586 --> 01:03:53,448
Literally, my world
is in Julie's hands.

1405
01:03:55,275 --> 01:03:56,965
This could either save me
or destroy me.

1406
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:02,896
Not too bad, huh? It's cute.

1407
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,241
I didn't play my idol today

1408
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:05,482
because I was
convinced otherwise.

1409
01:04:05,586 --> 01:04:07,103
They-they hatched a good plan.

1410
01:04:07,206 --> 01:04:09,620
Um, it made me feel comfortable,
which, kudos to them.

1411
01:04:09,724 --> 01:04:11,172
I'll keep smiling,
no matter what, though.

1412
01:04:11,275 --> 01:04:12,931
That's what I do.
I had a blast.

1413
01:04:13,034 --> 01:04:14,620
It's just been
absolutely amazing,

1414
01:04:14,724 --> 01:04:17,103
and I'm very thankful
to have the chance to come back.

1415
01:04:17,206 --> 01:04:18,551
I love this game, man.

1416
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,931
Truly love this game.
