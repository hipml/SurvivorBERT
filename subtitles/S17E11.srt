00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,476
the slide puzzle wins reward.

194
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,769
Want to know what you're playing

195
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,353
for?

196
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,187
>> Yeah.

197
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:13,730
>> PROBST: 31 days is a long

198
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,483
time to be without love.

199
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,318
I wish I could tell you

200
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,695
your loved ones were here,

201
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,362
coming around the corner.

202
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,865
They're not.

203
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,491
But that doesn't mean you can't

204
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,660
have a little love right now.

205
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,912
I have a Samsung Instinct

206
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,330
by Sprint.

207
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,957
Loaded onto this phone are video

208
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,709
messages from your loved ones

209
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,002
at home.

210
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:36,586
I'm going to give you a little

211
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,674
taste of that love right now.

212
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,511
Here's Andre and Destiny.

213
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,138
>> Hi, Crystal, this is Dre,

214
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:47,930
your big, old boo.

215
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,223
Just want you to know that

216
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,266
everything is going well here

217
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:50,641
on the home front.

218
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,311
>> Hi, Mommy, this is Destiny.

219
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,979
I love you. Be safe.

220
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,356
>> Oh, thank you.

221
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,149
I needed that.

222
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,192
>> PROBST: All right, Kenny, you

223
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,359
ready for a little love?

224
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:00,610
>> Yeah.

225
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,403
>> PROBST: Kenny, here's your

226
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,905
sister, Jenny.

227
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,531
>> Hey, Ken, it's Jenny.

228
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,407
Uh, I love you so much.

229
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,450
I miss you.

230
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,577
Do your best, and never give up.

231
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,955
(sniffling)

232
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,957
>> I can't believe I'm crying.

233
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,167
>> PROBST: Why?

234
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:16,751
>> I miss her.

235
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,043
I miss her.

236
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,378
I miss family.

237
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:19,879
I mean, it's been rough.

238
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,630
>> PROBST: You guys can crowd

239
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,924
around, too, if you want to see

240
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:23,966
each other's.

241
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,259
>> Oh, you guys get to see

242
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:25,635
my baby, I hope.

243
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,553
>> PROBST: All right, Susie.

244
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,387
Here's your husband.

245
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:28,888
>> Hey, hon, we miss you

246
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,847
something terrible.

247
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,890
>> We miss you a lot.

248
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,474
>> Look at my baby.

249
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,767
>> Oh, it's terrible how bad it

250
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,768
is around here without you being

251
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,393
here.

252
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:34,977
The house is way too quiet.

253
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,187
>> Aw...

254
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,230
>> PROBST: Your man and your

255
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:37,814
son, your two men.

256
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,606
>> That's my baby.

257
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,273
That's my man!

258
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,066
>> Yeah.

259
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,985
>> PROBST: All right, Corinne.

260
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,153
>> Hi, Corinne.

261
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,321
We miss you.

262
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:45,571
Hey, sis.

263
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,573
Uh, hope you're doing good out

264
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,407
there.

265
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,450
Kind of miss you over here.

266
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,827
I've got no one to talk to

267
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,036
when I've got something crazy

268
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,246
to tell someone.

269
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,288
>> PROBST: You got the whole

270
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,414
family and the brother.

271
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,207
>> Wow.

272
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,792
>> PROBST: All right, Bob.

273
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,210
Here's Peggy.

274
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,002
>> Hi, Bob.

275
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,337
How're you doing?

276
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,963
I hope that you're doing really

277
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,798
well.

278
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,216
What I mostly hope is that

279
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,008
you're having the adventure

280
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,343
of your lifetime.

281
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,302
>> She's pretty.

282
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:08,678
>> Oh, yeah. Yeah.

283
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,596
>> PROBST: Now, that's support.

284
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,140
All she said was, "I just hope

285
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,224
you're having the adventure

286
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:13,891
of a lifetime."

287
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,475
>> Yeah.

288
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,518
She's behind me a hundred

289
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,352
percent.

290
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:16,894
I'm the luckiest man in the

291
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,104
world.

292
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,522
>> PROBST: Aw.

293
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,399
Matty, you look anxious.

294
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:21,983
>> Oh...

295
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,276
>> PROBST: You want to go next?

296
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:23,860
>> Yeah.

297
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,318
>> PROBST: All right.

298
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,987
Who do you want to hear from?

299
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,571
>> Jamie.

300
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,572
>> PROBST: All right.

301
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,906
>> Hi, baby.

302
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,074
How are you doing?

303
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,534
We're happy as can be.

304
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,327
Yet, we do miss our other

305
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,829
partner, our family member,

306
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,038
Matty.

307
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,373
And don't ever forget that we

308
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,040
love you.

309
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,333
And we'll be here when you

310
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:39,876
return.

311
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,918
I love you so much.

312
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,669
(overlapping chatter)

313
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,545
>> Wow!

314
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,546
>> PROBST: Matty!

315
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,631
>> Yup.

316
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,632
>> Whoo!

317
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,633
>> PROBST: Last, but certainly

318
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,636
not least, Sugar.

319
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,597
Here's your sister, Rena.

320
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,473
>> Hey, Jessica, I hope you're

321
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:54,891
enjoying yourself.

322
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,185
You have us supporting you all

323
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,395
the way, but especially Dad,

324
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,938
who's smiling down at you from

325
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:01,731
above.

326
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,149
And remember that we love you

327
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,861
so much.

328
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:07,570
>> Thank you.

329
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,238
>> PROBST: Pretty nice message.

330
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,032
>> It's really nice to see her

331
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,076
and hear that from her.

332
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,077
>> PROBST: All right, guys.

333
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:15,870
Thanks for sharing those

334
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:19,999
with me.

335
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,792
All right, so, the winner of

336
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,294
today's challenge will enjoy

337
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,671
their entire loved one message--

338
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,714
there is more-- on the Sprint

339
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,967
phone, while enjoying a nice

340
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,345
little afternoon of pizza, beer,

341
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,180
brownies...

342
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,890
You'll fill up your belly and

343
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,183
you will fill up your heart.

344
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,351
Worth playing for?

345
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:38,935
>> Yes.

346
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:39,227
>> Oh, yeah.

347
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,769
>> PROBST: One more thing,

348
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,812
because today is all about

349
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,689
love, nobody is going to Exile

350
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:43,940
Island.

351
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,691
All right, we're going to draw

352
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,567
for teams.

353
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,361
Take a stone.

354
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,905
Please don't look.

355
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,991
Come on, now, keep it covered.

356
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,875
All right, everybody, palms out

357
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,668
and reveal.

358
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,211
If you have a yellow or red,

359
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,128
you're a captain.

360
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,464
Take a spot over here.

361
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,800
Crystal and Susie.

362
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,468
All right, we're going to rock,

363
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,052
paper, scissors-- see who goes

364
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,137
first.

365
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,056
>> One, two, three.

366
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:17,640
>> Scissors.

367
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,266
>> PROBST: Scissors cuts paper.

368
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,475
Susie, you choose first.

369
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:20,059
Who do you want on your team?

370
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,435
>> Matty.

371
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,478
>> PROBST: Crystal, who do you

372
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,062
want?

373
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,855
Sugar.

374
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,148
>> PROBST: Matty's choice.

375
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,024
>> Kenny.

376
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,109
>> PROBST: Kenny.

377
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,485
Sugar, who do you want?

378
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,278
>> Bob.

379
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,070
>> PROBST: Bob.

380
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,238
We have our two teams.

381
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,614
It is Sugar, Crystal, and Bob,

382
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,157
taking on Kenny, Matty, and

383
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,075
Susie.

384
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,244
Corinne, not chosen.

385
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:38,828
Corinne will not have any shot

386
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,705
of winning this reward.

387
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,206
>> When they started to pick,

388
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,249
and Crystal immediately picked

389
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,959
Sugar, I realized right away

390
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,377
they're all about, you know,

391
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,169
sticking together, sticking

392
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,546
together, and it sucks.

393
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,672
You know, I don't want to go

394
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,464
home.

395
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,757
And I don't know, you know, what

396
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,676
to do to save myself.

397
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,885
>> PROBST: Here we go.

398
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,596
Survivors ready?

399
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,849
Go.

400
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,601
Out into the muddy swamp.

401
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,229
Crystal, Sugar, Bob, all take

402
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,399
a hard fall right off the bat.

403
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,318
Crystal dragging Sugar.

404
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,819
>> Stay on the mark.

405
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,738
>> PROBST: Crystal not slowing

406
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,489
down for anybody.

407
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,241
Gonna have to work together or

408
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,617
this is going to be really

409
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,746
frustrating.

410
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,539
Crystal, Sugar, Bob, first with

411
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:26,709
their pieces.

412
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,419
Matty, Susie, and Kenny right

413
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:32,506
behind.

414
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,426
Sugar goes down again.

415
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,220
That swamp is thick with mud.

416
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,222
Hard to move.

417
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,932
Matty, Susie and Kenny now

418
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,559
making up a lot of ground.

419
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,895
Crystal now stuck.

420
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,022
Matty, Kenny, Susie back with

421
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,565
their first three pieces.

422
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,816
>> Good job, girl, good job.

423
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,859
>> Okay...

424
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,736
>> Come on!

425
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,029
>> PROBST: Crystal, Sugar, Bob,

426
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,072
back with their first three

427
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,823
pieces.

428
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,785
How much do you want that love?

429
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,246
Pizza, beer, brownies.

430
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,958
Long video message from home.

431
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,835
Kenny, Susie and Matty have

432
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,754
a good stride going.

433
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,880
Working well together.

434
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,424
>> Over here, baby.

435
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,843
>> PROBST: Everybody exhausted.

436
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:18,719
Matty, Susie, Kenny have their

437
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,680
last four sprocket pieces,

438
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,059
heading back.

439
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,268
>> Matty, Matty!

440
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:26,727
>> I can't!

441
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,229
>> Go...

442
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,355
>> I have no hands.

443
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,689
>> I know, I know, Matty, but...

444
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,358
>> PROBST: Bob, Crystal, Sugar

445
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,609
have their final four sprocket

446
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,568
pieces.

447
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,736
They're heading back.

448
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,740
Kenny, Susie, Matty, extending

449
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,117
their lead.

450
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,660
Bob, Sugar, Crystal playing it

451
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,702
very safe.

452
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,995
>> This is it! This is it!

453
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,163
This is it!

454
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,289
>> PROBST: Matty, Kenny, Susie

455
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,624
back with their final four

456
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,959
sprocket pieces.

457
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,711
Start working the puzzle.

458
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,089
Huge time advantage for Matty,

459
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,508
Kenny, and Susie.

460
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,843
>> Come on, Crystal.

461
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,844
>> PROBST: Bob, Sugar and

462
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,012
Crystal are back.

463
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,264
Start working on it.

464
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,807
All the pieces should interlock,

465
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,101
so that when you turn them,

466
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,270
they will raise the flag.

467
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,273
(indistinct chatter)

468
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,567
Bob, the physics teacher,

469
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,444
leading his team.

470
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,612
Kenny, the gamer, leading his

471
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,948
team.

472
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,533
>> Whoa, wrong one.

473
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,325
Where's the small one?

474
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:23,951
>> Right behind you.

475
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,204
>> Spin.

476
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,539
>> PROBST: Bob, Sugar, and

477
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,915
Crystal making a lot of

478
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,961
progress.

479
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,714
Getting very close with the

480
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,548
yellow team.

481
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,257
>> Pull it!

482
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,300
>> PROBST: Bob thinks they have

483
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,093
it.

484
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,346
And they do.

485
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,056
Sugar, Crystal, Bob moving on

486
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,641
to the final round.

487
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,353
>> Nice comeback, guys.

488
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:56,150
>> Sorry, guys.

489
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,693
>> PROBST: First to solve this

490
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,987
slide puzzle wins reward.

491
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,448
Survivors ready?

492
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,492
Go.

493
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,076
In front of you is what you are

494
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,163
trying to duplicate.

495
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,510
Bob thinks he has it.

496
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,428
And very quickly, Bob wins

497
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,638
reward!

498
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,680
(applause)

499
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,182
>> Wow, go, Bob!

500
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,600
>> Yeah, bob!

501
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,810
>> PROBST: That was fast.

502
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,978
Bob, come on over.

503
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,396
Congratulations.

504
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,066
Pizza, beer, brownies, loved one

505
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,692
from home on the Sprint phone.

506
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,693
This is for you.

507
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,486
>> Thanks, I appreciate it.

508
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,529
>> PROBST: All right, for the

509
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,071
rest of you, sorry, I got

510
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,072
nothing for you.

511
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,032
Head back to camp.

512
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,408
>> I really wanted to win

513
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:46,992
that reward.

514
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,536
I just wanted to see the whole

515
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,828
message that my sister had for

516
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,913
me, but Bob won.

517
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,206
And we think he's a threat.

518
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,707
So if he doesn't win immunity,

519
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,086
then he's next to go.

520
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,600
>> Hi, Bob. How're you doing?

521
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,935
You know, I miss you an awful

522
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,144
lot.

523
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,020
I know you're going to do well,

524
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,815
and... oh, wait a second.

525
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,857
There's something that I wanted

526
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:32,204
to show you. Hang on.

527
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,205
>> Oh, my God!

528
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:38,836
(laughter)

529
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,213
>> Can you believe this?

530
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,842
(laughter)

531
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:45,801
Look what we have!

532
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:46,385
>> I know.

533
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,428
>> You got a little treat.

534
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,637
Is this how you been eating?

535
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,638
>> Oh, yes.

536
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,682
Wait, I'll go get some termites.

537
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,434
>> Oh... no.

538
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,852
>> Oh, yeah, we've been eating

539
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,563
termite and turtle soup.

540
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,856
>> The moment I saw Bob, I

541
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,898
couldn't believe what he looked

542
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:00,482
like.

543
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,108
I was just so excited 'cause he

544
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:01,942
smelled like a campfire.

545
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,236
He smelled so good and he had

546
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,070
that full beard.

547
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,572
Your shirt!

548
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,156
(laughter)

549
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,407
>> My yellow shirt!

550
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,284
>> Oh, Bob!

551
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,827
He looks dirty, but I can tell

552
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,787
he's very happy.

553
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,663
You look really good.

554
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,457
>> Peggy's here.

555
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,666
I was completely convinced,

556
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,043
as was everybody else, that the

557
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,670
loved ones sent a video.

558
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,671
Cheers!

559
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,464
We're in Africa!

560
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,341
(laughter)

561
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,846
>> Y'all was like, "Crystal, are

562
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:31,597
you okay?"

563
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,389
>> Then you were, like...

564
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,432
You couldn't even get the

565
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,016
strength up to get back on the

566
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,559
thing.

567
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,769
You just stood there.

568
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,019
(laughter)

569
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,438
(Bob whistles)

570
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,149
>> Oh! Oh, my God, it's Peggy!

571
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,025
>> Oh, my God!

572
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,485
>> Are you kidding?!

573
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,903
>> She's coming!

574
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,445
>> This is where you are.

575
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,571
>> This is home.

576
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,865
>> Oh.

577
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,283
(indistinct chatter)

578
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,326
>> It's nice to meet you.

579
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:52,534
>> Hi.

580
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,453
>> So wait, you got to see our

581
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,913
loved ones?

582
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,039
>> It's really nice to meet you.

583
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,290
>> Did you see my sister?

584
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,333
>> Did you see my husband?

585
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,084
>> Hi, Matt.

586
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:00,459
Nice to see you.

587
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,044
>> Nice to see you, Peggy.

588
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:02,878
>> Who's that?

589
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,128
>> Kenny.

590
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,339
Kenny, how nice to meet you.

591
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,715
Matthew.

592
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,008
>> Watch, this is really cool.

593
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,218
Watch this.

594
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,011
(Bob whistles)

595
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,096
>> Oh, my God!

596
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,180
>> Oh, my God!

597
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,391
>> No, my... oh, no, please.

598
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,727
>> Oh, my... God.

599
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:23,607
(sobbing)

600
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,734
>> Oh, my God.

601
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,822
(laughing and crying)

602
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,178
>> I was so happy to see Andre.

603
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,305
I mean, "happy" is just not

604
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,474
good enough to explain.

605
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,225
I haven't seen him in so long.

606
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,811
And it was just so good to hold

607
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:01,895
him.

608
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,479
>> We totally didn't expect to

609
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,981
see you guys.

610
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:04,606
I mean, we were talking about

611
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,525
it.

612
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,235
>> Oh, my God!

613
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,070
>> Seeing my brother, and seeing

614
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,114
somebody who loves me and who

615
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,657
knows me and who gets my sense

616
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,159
of humor, and who knows how mean

617
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,536
I am and loves it, was such a

618
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,078
cool-- like, just... I was

619
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,165
overcome with emotion.

620
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:25,210
>> "Nobag."

621
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,712
>> I have a secret two alliance.

622
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,297
It's Sugar and Crystal, the big

623
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,423
one.

624
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,257
>> Okay.

625
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,301
>> And they trust me a hundred

626
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,469
percent because I saved both

627
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,970
their asses.

628
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,221
I saved both their asses.

629
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,181
>> Okay.

630
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,141
>> And right now, everybody

631
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:39,975
trusts me.

632
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:40,601
>> Mm-hmm.

633
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,185
>> But I will blindside Matty.

634
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,687
I took out, Jenny, I took out

635
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,314
five powerhouses, big guys.

636
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,441
Everybody loves me.

637
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,984
If I make the final three, I

638
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,196
will win this game.

639
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,238
>> Well, I'll tell you one

640
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,323
thing: Dad would be so proud of

641
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,074
you.

642
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:56,867
>> Yeah.

643
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,701
I did<i> Survivor</i> because I thought

644
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,120
it might help me get a little

645
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,289
bit of closure from my dad's

646
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,999
passing.

647
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,918
So my sister brought some of my

648
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,169
dad's ashes.

649
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,712
>> Do you want to say a prayer?

650
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,713
>> Yeah.

651
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,049
Thanks, Dad, for everything

652
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,509
you've done for me, and I know

653
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,927
that you're the one...

654
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,261
You're the reason that I'm here.

655
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,263
And that you're with me every

656
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,765
day that I've been here,

657
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,016
especially when we were on

658
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:21,725
Exile.

659
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,351
And thank you for this awesome

660
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,269
opportunity.

661
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,396
And thanks for being here with

662
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,940
me and keeping me strong, and

663
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,359
letting me see Rena and having

664
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,069
all this incredible stuff

665
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:36,865
happen.

666
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,283
>> Have fun in Africa, Dad.

667
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,369
(laughs)

668
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,121
>> I didn't speak at his funeral

669
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,665
because I was a big mess.

670
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,708
So it felt good to say a few

671
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,334
words because I really needed

672
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,838
him here and I feel like he's...

673
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,463
Like, I already felt like he was

674
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,299
here, but I feel like, um, I

675
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,593
brought him to Africa and he got

676
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,680
to stay.

677
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,687
>> Where are we going?

678
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,354
>> Down here.

679
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,272
>> Okay.

680
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,565
>> I've always been kind of weak

681
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,858
and I've always wanted to avoid

682
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,150
the tough things in life, you

683
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:12,734
know?

684
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,111
Like settling down and being

685
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,112
an adult, you know?

686
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:15,737
And that's what I realized out

687
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,030
here.

688
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,574
I got to face up to my fears

689
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,241
and grow up.

690
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,618
And I don't want to let another

691
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,787
day pass and me not let Jamie

692
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,497
know how much she means to me

693
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,293
and how much I value her.

694
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,711
>> This is incredible.

695
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,296
I love this.

696
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,923
>> Oh, yeah.

697
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,424
>> I love you, baby.

698
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,302
>> Hey...

699
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,929
(whispers): I love you.

700
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,472
I want to spend the rest of my

701
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:42,806
life with you.

702
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,725
>> I want to do the same, baby.

703
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,268
I want to do the same with you.

704
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,728
>> I want to share family with

705
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,520
you.

706
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,731
And I want to share kids.

707
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,440
And I want to share the future,

708
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,734
and I want to share the past,

709
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,027
and I want to share everything,

710
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,528
Jamie.

711
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:56,820
I really...

712
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,404
>> We will, baby, we will.

713
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,698
>> And I want us... I just want

714
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,490
to know right now.

715
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,327
I really want you to be my wife.

716
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,870
And I want... I want to marry

717
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,413
you and I want you to be my

718
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:06,622
wife.

719
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,790
And I made this for you.

720
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,291
Will you be my wife?

721
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,461
>> Yes, baby.

722
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,253
Yes! Yes! Yes!

723
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,463
>> I'm being serious.

724
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,673
I'm not joking around or joking.

725
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,884
I really love you.

726
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:19,468
Okay, let me put it on really

727
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,221
fast.

728
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,974
>> I love you.

729
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,809
>> Here, I made it for you.

730
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,393
>> You made this?

731
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,686
>> Yeah, should I get on my

732
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,270
knees?

733
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,313
Will you be my wife?

734
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,732
>> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

735
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,819
>> I love you, Jamie.

736
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,075
(indistinct chatter)

737
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,493
>> The whole experience today,

738
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,827
it means everything to me.

739
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,870
Because I know that Todd's

740
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,454
really proud of me, so that

741
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,499
makes me feel really good.

742
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,503
>> The good things in life

743
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,630
aren't easy.

744
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,422
And they require a lot of work

745
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,759
and a lot of digging deep.

746
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,135
And if you keep digging, you

747
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,178
will find it.

748
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:05,097
I mean, it's endless.

749
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,516
You have so much ability

750
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,725
and gold in you.

751
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,269
And if you just dig for it,

752
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,356
you will find it.

753
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,916
>> Hey, two peeps.

754
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,209
Who wants to get tree mail?

755
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:34,793
>> I'll go.

756
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,836
>> Corinne, go get tree mail.

757
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,920
>> I'll go with Corinne.

758
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:37,504
>> Yeah, go.

759
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:37,838
>> All right.

760
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:38,922
>> Get going.

761
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:39,965
>> You guys want to go.

762
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:40,549
Have fun.

763
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,591
>> Okay, we'll be right back.

764
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,511
>> Bye.

765
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,477
>> You know, there is a

766
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,313
possibility, very slight, that

767
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,898
they might get rid of Matty

768
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,441
if he doesn't win immunity.

769
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,609
>> Here's what I'm thinking...

770
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,652
>> You guys, don't you think

771
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,029
it's weird that there's a tribe

772
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,113
of people are living together

773
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,406
and a couple that of them know

774
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:04,740
they're going?

775
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,449
It's so weird.

776
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,159
>> They're outside, outskirts.

777
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:07,743
>> As for now, our five are

778
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,535
sticking together because we

779
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,495
have a better chance that way.

780
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,038
Hopefully, nobody's going

781
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,540
to flip.

782
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,462
>> He's good at everything.

783
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,504
You're the only person that

784
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,797
stands a chance against Bob in

785
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,215
a physical challenge, really.

786
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:22,841
>> Yeah.

787
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,134
>> That's true, Matty.

788
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,844
>> The plan is to vote out Bob

789
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,637
and then Corinne because Bob is

790
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,725
way bigger of a threat.

791
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,439
>> Remember when we threw the

792
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,857
idol into the ocean?

793
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,566
>> Yes.

794
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,776
>> And they never went and

795
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,526
checked the bottle.

796
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,570
But Marcus threw it in.

797
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,823
Did you know that he had the

798
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,617
idol in his pocket when he came

799
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,451
back and hid it around camp?

800
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,370
And showed me where it was.

801
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,455
And said, "It's hidden over

802
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,289
here."

803
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:54,873
>> No way.

804
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,457
He didn't have it when he went

805
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,502
to Tribal, so if I win immunity,

806
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,420
I can give that to you.

807
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,505
>> That's a legit idol?

808
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,547
>> No, but it sounded pretty

809
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,381
good, didn't it?

810
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,177
>> Oh. Yeah, it did sound good.

811
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,512
>> I'm going to put it together,

812
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,139
and I'm going to imply that I've

813
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:11,765
got the idol we were supposed

814
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,475
to have thrown in the ocean.

815
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:13,725
>> Wow.

816
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,894
>> I am going to make my second

817
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,563
very good fake idol of the game.

818
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,691
And the plan with the idol is,

819
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,068
I'm going to tell somebody on

820
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,528
the other side that I've got the

821
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,696
the original idol that was

822
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,989
supposed to have gone into the

823
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,615
ocean, so they've got to be

824
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:32,285
careful how they vote.

825
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,498
>> Good for you, Bob.

826
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,585
Good plan.

827
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:48,760
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

828
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,303
You guys ready to get to today's

829
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,138
immunity challenge?

830
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:51,721
>> You got it.

831
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:51,972
>> Yes.

832
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,348
>> PROBST: First things first--

833
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,725
Kenny, give it up.

834
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,144
(laughs)

835
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,937
Once again, immunity is back up

836
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,480
for grabs.

837
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,565
For today's challenge, I'm

838
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,607
going to ask you questions

839
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,900
about Gabon.

840
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,526
Each time you answer correctly,

841
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,945
you earn a ball.

842
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:07,571
You're then going to take turns

843
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,157
throwing your balls toward

844
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,117
a target divided by zones.

845
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,994
The person who lands their ball

846
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,871
in a zone closest to the center

847
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,873
wins immunity, guaranteed a

848
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,251
one-in-six shot at winning this

849
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:21,585
game.

850
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,627
Losers go to Tribal Council

851
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,670
where somebody will be voted

852
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,422
out.

853
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,007
Anything not clear?

854
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,717
Let's get started.

855
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,552
All right, here we go.

856
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,096
First question, true or false:

857
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,556
gorillas were actually first

858
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,643
discovered here in Gabon?

859
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:46,776
All right, everybody, reveal.

860
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,196
Correct answer is...

861
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:49,988
true.

862
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:50,989
Sugar got it right.

863
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,449
Corinne got it right.

864
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,450
Gorillas were discovered here

865
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,328
in 1847.

866
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,330
Sugar gets a ball.

867
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,581
Corinne gets a ball.

868
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,500
Next question: a male elephant

869
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,502
is called a bull.

870
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,172
A female elephant is called:

871
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,967
"A," a mare; "B," a doe;

872
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,803
or, "C," a cow.

873
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,639
Everybody reveal.

874
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,142
Correct answer is "C," the cow.

875
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,435
Sugar got it right.

876
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,436
Susie got it right.

877
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,437
Corinne got it right.

878
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,772
And Bob got it right.

879
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,024
Next question.

880
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,443
It is a fact that the Gabonese

881
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,029
viper is a poisonous snake.

882
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,240
True or false: it is considered

883
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,451
virtually harmless to humans.

884
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,161
Everybody reveal.

885
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,122
Susie and Corinne say it is

886
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,624
true that it is virtually

887
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,792
harmless to humans.

888
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,793
A poisonous snake, Susie and

889
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,380
Corinne, is deadly to humans.

890
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:48,797
The answer is false.

891
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,258
Yes, it was a trick question.

892
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,133
Good news is, everybody's

893
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:52,926
on the board.

894
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:53,718
Everybody's going to get

895
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,636
at least one shot at the target.

896
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,638
Sugar currently in front with

897
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,639
three shots.

898
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,184
Last question, true or false:

899
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,894
the elephant's trunk has three

900
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,771
purposes: it serves as its

901
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:10,360
nose, its arm, and its mouth.

902
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,696
Everybody reveal.

903
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,448
Crystal says true.

904
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,075
Susie says true.

905
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:17,659
The trunk is the nose and the

906
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,286
arm.

907
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,495
It is not the mouth.

908
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,288
Kenny got it right.

909
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,080
Matty got it right.

910
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,039
Sugar got it right.

911
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,374
Corinne got it right and Bob

912
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,166
got it right.

913
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,750
All right, well, we know what

914
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,751
you know about Gabon.

915
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,254
Let's see how it plays out.

916
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,298
Head over here.

917
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:31,798
Kenny, you're first up.

918
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,757
>> Good luck, Kenny.

919
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,969
>> Let's do this.

920
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,220
>> PROBST: Kenny has two balls.

921
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,557
Using your first one.

922
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:40,890
No hesitation.

923
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,518
>> What?! Oh!

924
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,894
>> PROBST: Nice shot, sixth

925
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,146
zone from the center.

926
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,772
Matty, you're trying to get as

927
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,482
close as you can to that center

928
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,275
zone.

929
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,861
That looks good.

930
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,612
Fourth zone from the center.

931
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,698
Matty is now the mark to beat.

932
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,908
Sugar.

933
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,660
Ooh, soft launch, going to look

934
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,495
for some roll.

935
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,580
She gets it.

936
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,206
Not close enough.

937
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,167
Matty, still the mark to beat.

938
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,377
Susie, you get one shot.

939
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:09,836
Don't be short, woman.

940
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,713
Come strong.

941
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,673
Good launch.

942
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,884
Not going to be good enough.

943
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,054
No shot at winning immunity.

944
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,139
Corinne.

945
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,308
Ooh, good-looking toss.

946
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,434
Nobody.

947
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,770
No, fifth zone from the middle.

948
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,105
Matty's still the mark to beat.

949
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,398
Bob going to take his first

950
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,191
shot.

951
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,567
>> It's all physics.

952
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,945
(laughter)

953
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,947
>> PROBST: Good follow-through.

954
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,157
Look at that.

955
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,824
Bob, with his first toss,

956
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,494
is now the mark to beat.

957
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,078
>> Good job, Bob.

958
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:43,370
>> Nice job.

959
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,746
>> PROBST: Crystal got one

960
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,873
question right and gets only one

961
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,707
shot.

962
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,210
Crystal with no backspin.

963
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:50,710
Gets a good roll.

964
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,504
Not good enough.

965
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,546
Crystal's now out of the

966
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,381
challenge.

967
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,383
Kenny.

968
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,843
Kenny launches it.

969
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,638
Oh, it was in, and then out.

970
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,097
>> Oh, Kenny!

971
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,390
>> PROBST: Kenny is out of this

972
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,599
challenge now.

973
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,975
Matty with his last shot at

974
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:10,105
this.

975
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,315
>> No, Matt.

976
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,525
>> PROBST: Nope, Matty falls

977
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,109
short.

978
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,402
Matty is now out of this

979
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,111
challenge.

980
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:16,945
No shot at winning.

981
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,824
Sugar up next.

982
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:24,786
Nice, little soft touch.

983
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,205
Oh, just misses.

984
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,957
Not close enough.

985
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,250
Corinne is up.

986
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,962
Big immunity on the line.

987
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,839
Good toss.

988
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:36,756
Too far out.

989
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,217
Bob's up.

990
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,760
He is already the mark to beat.

991
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,595
He can afford to be a little

992
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,097
risky now.

993
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,473
It's going to be short.

994
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,516
Will it roll?

995
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,100
It does.

996
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,643
Bob improves his mark.

997
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,019
He is now one zone from the

998
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:50,270
center.

999
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,438
>> Wow!

1000
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,397
>> PROBST: Going to be very

1001
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,815
tough to beat Bob.

1002
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:57,861
Sugar.

1003
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,738
Sugar going for the roll, and

1004
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,906
she won't get it.

1005
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,741
Bob, still the mark to beat.

1006
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,743
Corinne, your last shot at

1007
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,995
immunity.

1008
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,288
Goes very high.

1009
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,581
Will she get a good kick?

1010
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,165
She does.

1011
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,708
Is it going to be enough? No.

1012
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,083
(Corinne groans)

1013
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,960
Corinne has no shot at immunity.

1014
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:20,049
Bob, with your last ball.

1015
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,634
Bob doesn't improve his lie.

1016
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,927
Bob is still the mark to beat,

1017
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:23,178
though.

1018
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,971
One last shot.

1019
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,723
Sugar, this is it.

1020
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,266
You need to get in either the

1021
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,143
center zone or the first zone

1022
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:30,894
outside of the center.

1023
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,981
Anything else doesn't matter.

1024
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,695
Sugar launches it.

1025
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:41,696
And a good roll.

1026
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,198
It's in and out of the center.

1027
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:43,865
Bob wins immunity!

1028
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,075
>> Good job, Bob.

1029
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,077
>> Handshake?

1030
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,163
>> PROBST: Bob, come on over.

1031
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,956
(applause)

1032
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,957
Nice job.

1033
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,125
>> Thank you, sir.

1034
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:54,918
>> PROBST: Bob is safe

1035
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,211
at tonight's Tribal Council.

1036
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,504
Cannot be voted out of this

1037
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,087
game.

1038
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,631
One-in-six shot at winning it

1039
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,423
all.

1040
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,716
For the rest of you, Tribal

1041
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,759
Council tonight, where one of

1042
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,052
you will be voted out of this

1043
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:04,219
game.

1044
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,470
Grab your stuff.

1045
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,304
Head back to camp.

1046
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,347
I'll see you at Tribal.

1047
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,389
>> Winning today's immunity

1048
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,182
challenge saved me.

1049
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,725
I'm going to get the fake idol

1050
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:11,559
built.

1051
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,894
There are five Fang members

1052
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,481
here, and I'm going to suggest

1053
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,899
that two of them go in with

1054
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,858
Corinne and I.

1055
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,736
If all goes as planned, perfect

1056
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:25,823
time to blindside Matty.

1057
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,790
>> Well done, Bob.

1058
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,750
>> Yeah, very good.

1059
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,919
I felt like such a big dunce.

1060
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:38,962
>> Obviously, Bob and I know

1061
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,463
that our numbers are up, so

1062
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,756
we've got this whole back story

1063
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,049
about why we have the idol that

1064
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,551
was supposedly launched into

1065
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,427
the ocean at the Fake Out Feast.

1066
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,137
But what we needed to have this

1067
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,931
work correctly was at least one

1068
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,599
of us to get the immunity idol,

1069
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,435
which is exactly what happened.

1070
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,019
The story is this: Marcus got

1071
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,729
the idol.

1072
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,313
You were the only person that

1073
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,565
knew about it.

1074
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,607
I've never known about it.

1075
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,191
>> Right.

1076
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,276
If you hadn't gotten immunity

1077
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,652
tonight, you would have used it

1078
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,319
for yourself.

1079
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,612
But you got immunity, and the

1080
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,154
only way to keep yourself in

1081
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,490
this game is to give it to me

1082
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,783
so that I'm still in the game,

1083
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:09,367
and to take out the strongest

1084
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,660
player, being Matty.

1085
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,953
If they think I'm going to play

1086
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,996
the idol, they're not going

1087
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,454
to want to vote me.

1088
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,914
>> You are a conniving son

1089
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,748
of a gun.

1090
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,332
>> So are you.

1091
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,125
>> Thank you very much.

1092
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:17,917
>> I hope this works.

1093
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,377
It's such a long shot, but it's

1094
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,503
all we got.

1095
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,671
Let's do it.

1096
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,964
I think I'm very smart, and I

1097
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,048
think Bob is very crafty.

1098
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,341
And we put those two forces

1099
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,050
together.

1100
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,051
This was the best we could do.

1101
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,679
It would be so awesome if this

1102
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,097
worked.

1103
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,186
>> The only thing, I think,

1104
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,229
Corinne's trying to make Bob

1105
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,480
give her the immunity necklace.

1106
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,106
>> Probably.

1107
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:40,982
>> If he gives it to her, it's

1108
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,568
still before for the vote.

1109
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,612
So, we just... Bob's got to go.

1110
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,946
>> Yeah, all we know is this

1111
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,406
five is tight and we're staying

1112
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,574
strong.

1113
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,116
And Corinne's gone.

1114
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,909
No one's flipping.

1115
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,328
No, we're good.

1116
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,370
I don't know why everybody's

1117
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:54,954
worried.

1118
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,581
>> 'Cause this game makes you

1119
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,332
worry, man.

1120
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,166
>> Bob, uh, won the immunity

1121
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,000
challenge today.

1122
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,586
So, uh, today we need to vote

1123
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,420
out Corinne.

1124
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,546
But it's dangerous.

1125
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,839
We're getting down to the final

1126
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,341
six with Bob still in it, and

1127
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,634
Bob's a major threat when it

1128
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,553
comes down to it, so... it's

1129
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,640
nerve-wracking, man.

1130
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,316
>> You really can't say

1131
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:23,566
anything.

1132
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,318
>> I promise. I swear.

1133
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,361
>> So remember when they threw

1134
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,612
the idol out into the ocean?

1135
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,196
>> Uh-huh.

1136
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:28,988
>> Well, Marcus ripped the

1137
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,531
string, but had the rest of the

1138
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,407
idol in his pocket.

1139
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,700
Never put it in the ocean.

1140
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,035
He brought it back to camp and

1141
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:34,369
hid it with Bob.

1142
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,119
But since he won immunity

1143
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,163
today, he's like, "Listen, if we

1144
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,706
use it now, you know, it will

1145
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,290
help."

1146
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,333
>> Who are you guys going

1147
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:40,625
to take out?

1148
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,209
>> We're taking out Matty, and

1149
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,794
that's it.

1150
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,420
So he may end up going home,

1151
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,672
but I know I'm not.

1152
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,091
>> I think right now, your

1153
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,550
and Bob's best chance is to

1154
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,551
take out Matty.

1155
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,095
>> Let me see if I can get Bob.

1156
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,638
>> Yeah, I think you, me and Bob

1157
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,305
should talk.

1158
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,598
>> Well, he doesn't know I told

1159
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,182
you yet.

1160
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,475
Let me, uh, soften the blow.

1161
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,768
Give me a second, Kenny.

1162
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,394
>> This has definitely changed

1163
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,938
the game, and I think the best

1164
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,898
shot is to blindside Matty

1165
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,858
right now.

1166
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,527
I think I might have to jump

1167
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,028
alliances now.

1168
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,114
Oh, my God.

1169
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,868
>> Yeah.

1170
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,453
>> So we're trying to figure out

1171
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,038
the best way to strategize.

1172
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:19,872
I don't know.

1173
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,498
>> I think the best option is...

1174
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,207
>> Yeah, tell us, 'cause you're

1175
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,042
just as smart as we are,

1176
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,085
and we need your input.

1177
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,169
>> I know Matty's not that

1178
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,505
smart.

1179
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:30,842
>> So I'm wondering...

1180
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,009
>> Marcus took it off...

1181
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,302
>> Do you think maybe the better

1182
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,095
person 'cause she's smarter

1183
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,388
than the rest of them, is

1184
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,180
Crystal?

1185
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,223
Do you think Crystal would

1186
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,391
separate from the others?

1187
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,100
>> I think Crystal would

1188
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,602
probably join us.

1189
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,186
>> So maybe...

1190
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,479
>> And if we get Crystal in,

1191
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,773
we'll go to the final four.

1192
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,399
>> Yup.

1193
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,442
>> And we'll figure it out

1194
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:47,734
from there.

1195
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,693
>> Yeah.

1196
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,277
We come up with a ridiculously

1197
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,987
harebrained scheme that

1198
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,238
shouldn't work at all, and it

1199
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,072
might actually work, which is

1200
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,282
so mind-blowing.

1201
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,576
It just shows you the level of,

1202
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,201
like, incompetence we're playing

1203
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:01,831
with.

1204
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,300
>> What we're going to do is

1205
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,011
ask Crystal if she'd like to be

1206
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:15,386
on our alliance.

1207
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,722
And we're giving her the chance

1208
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,265
to join with us.

1209
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:23,603
I just collected these pieces.

1210
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,481
I'm worse than a raven.

1211
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,067
I save everything.

1212
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,360
I don't know about you, but

1213
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,988
that would fool me.

1214
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:35,406
(chittering)

1215
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,036
>> How close were you to Marcus

1216
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,078
when he threw it in?

1217
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,079
>> We were far.

1218
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,790
>> Yeah.

1219
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,291
You saw the idol that was

1220
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,460
on the bottle, right?

1221
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,669
>> Yeah.

1222
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,922
>> It had a face on it.

1223
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,382
It was...

1224
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:55,760
>> Right.

1225
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,637
>> That's the idol.

1226
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,139
>> Final four: you, me, Kenny,

1227
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,308
and Corinne.

1228
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,643
We don't want to use this

1229
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,477
tonight.

1230
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,229
Would you be interested in

1231
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,148
taking out Matty tonight?

1232
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,275
Go on board with us.

1233
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,819
>> I'm on board.

1234
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,987
>> Operation Fake Idol II is

1235
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,948
working like a charm.

1236
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,533
And the interesting thing is

1237
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,242
we're not even going to have

1238
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,577
to use the idol.

1239
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,704
>> Bob said "Matty."

1240
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,330
>> We're taking out Matty?

1241
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:28,751
Even better for us.

1242
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,044
>> Look, we have to flush out

1243
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:30,628
their idol.

1244
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,296
>> Bob shook my hand and gave

1245
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,589
me a kiss on the cheek.

1246
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,215
>> What?

1247
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,258
>> So that's a big deal for him.

1248
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,510
>> Okay, look, you have to vote

1249
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:37,802
for Corinne.

1250
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,011
>> Okay.

1251
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:39,846
>> You understand that.

1252
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,429
>> Yes.

1253
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:40,972
>> Everybody's voting for

1254
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:41,889
Corinne.

1255
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:42,473
>> Yes.

1256
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,766
>> Okay, I'm going to vote for

1257
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,392
Matty.

1258
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,434
>> That'll be three for Matty.

1259
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:45,893
>> Three for Matty.

1260
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,061
>> And four for Corinne.

1261
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:47,687
>> Yeah, I'll make sure he plays

1262
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,397
the idol, so the idol's gone,

1263
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,525
Matty's gone-- boom!

1264
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,192
This is the best plan.

1265
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,945
I know for a fact that Crystal

1266
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,530
is going to vote for Corinne.

1267
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,073
And Corinne is going to play her

1268
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,033
idol, a win-win situation for

1269
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,326
me because the idol's flushed

1270
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,078
out and Matty's going to be

1271
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:04,370
going home.

1272
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,123
So if this plan works out, oh,

1273
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,834
I'll be the biggest strategist

1274
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,294
in <i>Survivor </i>history.

1275
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,837
>> But it's going to be a little

1276
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,130
tense there tonight.

1277
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:14,755
>> We'll have numbers out there

1278
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,298
tonight anyways.

1279
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,050
I think it's a good plan.

1280
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:18,968
>> Yeah.

1281
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,428
>> I think it's the best...

1282
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,846
>> I think the four of us...

1283
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,681
It's going to be my first flop

1284
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,348
in the game, but hopefully, it's

1285
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,767
a good choice.

1286
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,810
>> Every fiber of me wants

1287
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,145
to trust Kenny.

1288
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,730
If the idol is real, then

1289
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,856
Matty's gone.

1290
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,900
But if they got a fake idol,

1291
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,318
Corinne goes home, and I've

1292
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,235
definitely been weighing who's

1293
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,029
better to take out.

1294
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,322
My heart tells me to take Matty

1295
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:39,488
out.

1296
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,657
Corinne is not the threat to me

1297
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,950
in no way, shape or form.

1298
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,534
This is, like, my only chance

1299
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,286
to get him out, and it's been

1300
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,955
wracking my brain.

1301
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,415
The mental part of this game is

1302
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:53,502
kicking my ass.

1303
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,230
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1304
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,608
the members of our jury.

1305
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:19,528
Marcus, Charlie, and Randy,

1306
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,030
voted out at the last Tribal

1307
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,367
Council.

1308
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,329
Susie, can you still feel

1309
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,790
old Tribal lines, or is now

1310
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,291
this now "How do I win this

1311
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:32,917
game?"

1312
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,960
>> The alliances that you make

1313
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:34,502
have to get you to a certain

1314
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,295
point, and when people start

1315
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,880
getting paranoid, it's a domino

1316
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,674
effect.

1317
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,468
So you do have to think ahead.

1318
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,261
>> PROBST: Bob, does this make

1319
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,888
sense, this paranoia?

1320
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,347
Is that inevitable?

1321
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,391
>> This is the first time I

1322
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,433
haven't been paranoid.

1323
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,811
I get to realize what it feels

1324
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,311
like to have this on.

1325
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,730
But I'll be paranoid next time

1326
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,065
I come in here.

1327
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,066
>> PROBST: Corinne, can

1328
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,651
paranoia be an advantage?

1329
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,819
>> I suppose it can.

1330
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,112
You know, obviously, Bob and I

1331
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,571
are kind of on the outside, and

1332
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,615
they're a tight group of five.

1333
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,242
If paranoia sets in, maybe

1334
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,369
there is a possibility to try

1335
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,580
and, you know, break it up.

1336
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,623
>> PROBST: Sugar, what's the

1337
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,750
worst part about paranoia as it

1338
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,961
relates to your game?

1339
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,295
>> People freaking out and

1340
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,548
believing lies and flipping.

1341
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,217
I mean, you just have to, like,

1342
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,385
keep everybody in check and

1343
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,636
make sure nobody is being

1344
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,930
gullible and getting duped.

1345
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:28,556
>> PROBST: Crystal, at a certain

1346
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,432
point, does it become crazy

1347
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,558
to trust?

1348
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,812
>> With certain people, yes.

1349
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,605
Certain people, no.

1350
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,815
>> PROBST: And is the whole

1351
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,566
trick of this game figuring out

1352
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,652
when that time is?

1353
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,404
>> That is the whole trick of

1354
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,614
the game: knowing when to trust

1355
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,410
and when to cut your ties.

1356
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,911
>> PROBST: Kenny, is tonight's

1357
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,621
vote any more important, less

1358
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,373
important than any other vote?

1359
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,583
>> I think it's very important

1360
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,459
tonight.

1361
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,544
Because you think that you can

1362
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,837
trust somebody, and then you

1363
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,629
don't.

1364
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,672
Because after you see the

1365
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,049
votes, you're going to be like,

1366
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:03,966
"Whoa, who did this?

1367
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,717
Who did that?"

1368
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,551
So I would say tonight's vote is

1369
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,970
very important, compared to any

1370
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,056
other vote.

1371
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,098
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1372
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:11,682
to the vote.

1373
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,892
Bob, you have the individual

1374
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:13,476
immunity necklace.

1375
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,769
I assume you're going to keep

1376
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,770
it for yourself tonight.

1377
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,812
>> Very good assumption.

1378
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:17,855
>> PROBST: Cannot vote for Bob.

1379
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:18,898
Everybody else is fair game.

1380
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,191
It is time to vote.

1381
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:24,278
Corinne, you're up.

1382
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:41,545
>> Matty, this is clearly

1383
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,091
a strategic move, and I'm sorry

1384
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:49,178
to see you go, bro.

1385
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,575
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1386
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,663
votes.

1387
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,507
> PROBST: If anybody has the

1388
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,633
hidden immunity idol and you

1389
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,927
want to play it, now would be

1390
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,014
the time to do so.

1391
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,533
>> PROBST: Okay, once the votes

1392
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,909
are read, the decision is final.

1393
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,202
The person voted out will be

1394
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,245
asked to leave the Tribal

1395
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:56,787
Council area immediately.

1396
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:02,001
I'll read the votes.

1397
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:06,172
First vote: Matty.

1398
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,507
Corinne.

1399
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,550
One vote Matty;

1400
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,888
one vote Corinne.

1401
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,889
Corinne.

1402
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:15,973
Two votes Corinne;

1403
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:20,644
one vote Matty.

1404
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,021
Corinne.

1405
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:22,563
That's three votes Corinne;

1406
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:26,734
one vote Matty.

1407
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,527
Matty.

1408
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:28,903
Two votes Matty;

1409
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:34,200
three votes Corinne.

1410
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,660
Matty.

1411
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,746
We're tied: three votes Corinne;

1412
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,164
three votes Matty.

1413
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:44,251
One vote left.

1414
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,713
12th person voted out of

1415
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,131
<i>Survivor: Gabon </i>and the fourth

1416
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,758
member of our jury.

1417
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,135
Corrine, you need to bring me

1418
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:57,223
your torch.

1419
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:08,442
Corinne, the tribe has spoken.

1420
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:09,610
Time for you to go.

1421
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,530
>> Thanks.

1422
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,204
>> PROBST: Well, the big theme

1423
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,830
of the night: paranoia.

1424
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,374
The question is, how do you make

1425
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,377
the paranoia work for you and

1426
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,962
not against you?

1427
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:28,963
Grab your torches.

1428
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:29,964
Head back to camp.

1429
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,967
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i>

1440
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:56,949
>> Okay.

1441
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:57,992
Bob put himself in this

1442
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:58,242
position.

1443
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:58,784
He kind of messed with the

1444
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,369
wrong guy.

1445
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,370
>> Crystal and Kenny can take

1446
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,246
out whoever they want.

1447
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:02,871
Kenny acts like he's this weak,

1448
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,249
little meager guy, and he spins

1449
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:05,791
all these lies.

1450
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:09,128
And Crystal is just a big bully.

1451
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:14,883
I can't stand Sugar.

1452
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,010
I'll never be able to stand

1453
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,386
Sugar, and I plan to never

1454
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,345
exchange another sentence with

1455
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:18,887
that girl for the rest of my

1456
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,140
life.

1457
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:21,849
You know, I really just don't

1458
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,019
like any of those people, other

1459
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,228
than Bob and Kenny.

1460
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,063
And I really, really, really

1461
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,356
wish Kenny and Bob all the

1462
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:29,940
best.

1463
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,025
And I hope the rest of them
