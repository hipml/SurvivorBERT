1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:07,882
SHE HAD IT RIGHT.

2
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,217
JOE, GET ONE BIG SHOT.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,886
WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE
WORLD CAME OUT HERE TO BE WITH

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,429
US TONIGHT.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,972
VERY COOL.

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:18,268
AND LET'S SAY HELLO TO OUR 18
PLAYERS THAT GAVE US SUCH AN

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:18,768
ENTERTAINING SEASON.

8
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:24,107
EVERYBODY NOW BACK.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,276
SO, BEN IS STILL BASKING IN THE
GLORY OF HIS WIN.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,281
BUT, BEN, EVERY HERO NEEDS A
WORTHY ADVERSARY, AND YOU HAD

11
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,115
ONE IN CHRISSY.

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,324
>> YES, YES.

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,327
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, I GOTTA GIVE
IT YOU UP TO YOU, IT WAS REALLY

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:40,415
OUTSTANDING FROM-- TAKE ME BACK
BECAUSE 16 YEARS YOU APPLIED TO

15
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,958
BE ON THIS SHOW.

16
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,209
YOU FINALLY GET OUT THERE.

17
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,754
AND I REMEMBER STANDING AT THE
END OF THAT FIRST CHALLENGE WHEN

18
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,297
YOU WERE THROWING UP.

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,924
WHAT-- WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT THE
DREAM, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU

20
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,675
GOT OUT THERE?

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,135
WAS IT OVERWHELMING FOR A
MOMENT?

22
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,344
>> YES.

23
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,974
THE FUNNY THING ABOUT DREAMS,
RIGHT, IS THAT IS IT BETTER TO

24
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,268
HAVE A DREAM THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TURNS OUT AND YOU CAN

25
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,313
IMAGINE IT OR ACTUALLY GET THAT
DREAM AND FIND OUT FOR REAL?

26
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,192
AND WHEN I FOUND MYSELF OUT
THERE, I WAS TERRIFIED.

27
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:11,988
AND I WAS SO TERRIFIED THAT IT
WASN'T GOING TO LIVE UP-- OR I

28
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:14,657
WASN'T GOING TO DO AS WELL AS I
POSSIBLY COULD HAVE.

29
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,826
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THREW UP.

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,328
I WAS-- I WAS SO SCARED.

31
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,498
>> Jeff: WELL, AND I WANT TO
REMIND PEOPLE, YOU GAVE UP A

32
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,165
LOT.

33
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:22,791
YOU KNOW, YOU GAVE UP YOUR JOB.

34
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,043
DID YOU GET YOUR JOB BACK?

35
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,504
>> NO, I ASKED FOR THE TIME OFF,
AND I ACTUALLY LOST MY JOB TO

36
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,797
PLAY THIS GAME.

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,466
BUT, YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE
DAY, IT'S A GIFT.

38
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,675
RIGHT?

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,554
IT WAS A GIFT OF TIME THEY GOT
WITH MY FAMILY, AND I HAVEN'T

40
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,680
GONE BACK YET.

41
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,184
AND I'VE BEEN ENJOYING EVERY
MOMENT OF BEING WITH THEM.

42
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,185
<i>( APPLAUSE ).</i>

43
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,020
>> Jeff: WOW, THAT'S
FANTASTIC.

44
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,188
>> YEAH.

45
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,357
>> Jeff: RYAN, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY JOKED ABOUT YOUR TINY

46
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,360
BODY, BUT THAT'S HOW YOU WERE
WHEN WE MET YOU.

47
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:50,652
YOU'RE A SMALL GUY.

48
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,861
>> YEAH.

49
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,446
>> Jeff: BUT DID THE FOOD, THE
LACK OF FOOD STILL SURPRISE EVEN

50
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,697
YOU?

51
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,493
>> OH, YEAH, THE DEPRIVATION OUT
THERE WAS A COMPLETE SHOCK FOR

52
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,536
ME.

53
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,163
I HAD NEVER SEEN MY HEART
BEATING THROUGH MY CHEST.

54
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,749
IT SHOWED PEOPLE I DO INDEED
HAVE A HEART AT LEAST.

55
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,000
IT'S SO REAL.

56
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,670
AND YOU SIGN UP FOR IT, AND I'VE
WATCHED IT FOR YEARS, DISECTED

57
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,879
THE SHOW WITH MY DAD.

58
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,299
BUT YOU DON'T DISSECT, YOU KNOW
NOT BEING ABLE TO EAT AND YOU

59
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,175
CAN'T PREPARE FOR THAT.

60
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,594
GETTING OUT THERE AND PUSHING
YOURSELF.

61
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,388
LIFE DOESN'T GIVE YOU MANY
OPPORTUNITIES TO PUT YOURSELF IN

62
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,683
SITUATION WHERE'S YOU CAN PROVE
IT TO YOURSELF AND, YOU KNOW, I

63
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,853
CAME UP SHORT, YEAH, BUT I
PROVED TO MYSELF THEY CAN HANG

64
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,979
WITH THE BEST.

65
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,564
>> Jeff: CONGRATS.

66
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,399
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

67
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,528
THINK KEEPS "SURVIVOR" RELEVANT
IS WE HAVE NEW PEOPLE PLAYING

68
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,573
EVERY YEAR AND THEIR STORIES ARE
OF THE MOMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE

69
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,367
CURRENT, AND SOMETIMES THEIR
STORIES BRING TO LIGHT SOMETHING

70
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,244
IMPORTANT THAT IS GOING ON IN
THE CULTURE RIGHT NOW.

71
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,956
WE SAW IT LAST YEAR WITH ZEKE
AND TRANSGENDER ISSUES.

72
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,541
IT WAS A CULTURAL MILESTONE.

73
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:50,044
WE HAD ANOTHER IMPORTANT STORY
THAT EMERGED THIS SEASON WITH

74
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:50,420
BEN.

75
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,797
TAKE A LOOK.

76
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,592
>> I WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS.

77
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,259
>> DAMN IT!

78
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,262
>> I THINK HE HAS P.T.S.D.

79
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,973
>> I DON'T LIKE LOUD NOISES LIKE
THAT.

80
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,642
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH COMBAT AND
YOU COME BACK, THERE'S NO WAY TO

81
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,977
ADJUST FULLY.

82
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,439
THERE'S THINGS UPSTAIRS THAT ARE
THERE FOREVER.

83
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,567
COMING BACK WITH THAT STUFF,
IT'S HARD, AND YOU FEEL LONELY.

84
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,277
I DIDN'T SWEAR ON THE MARINE CO.

85
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,614
OTHER PEOPLES, CIVILIANS,
WHATEVER, HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S

86
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,449
LIKE TO BE SHOT AT, TO HAVE
PEOPLE TRY TO KILL YOU.

87
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,786
SO THOSE REACTIONS ARE 100% REAL
FOR MEN AND WOMEN HAVE THAT

88
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,455
FOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.

89
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:32,003
MY WIFE AND KIDS HAVE DEFINITELY
SAVED ME FROM MY DEMONS AND THE

90
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,171
PAST.

91
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,465
BUT THERE'S A BIGGER PICTURE,
AND IT'S BIGGER THAN ME, MY

92
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,468
FAMILY, THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR."

93
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:43,348
JUST BEING ABLE TO SHOW VETS WHO
HAVE GONE THROUGH BATTLE AND

94
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:48,102
P.T.S.D., THERE'S A WAY TO LIFE
OUTSIDE OF ALL THAT HELL.

95
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,146
YOU HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE
FUTURE, BECAUSE THE PAST WILL

96
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,356
EAT YOU ALIVE, BUT THE FUTURE
WILL SAVE YOU.

97
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,817
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

98
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,821
<i>( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
>> Jeff: SO, BEN, HAVE YOU

99
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,614
HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE?

100
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,617
I MEAN, YOU WERE PRETTY
VULNERABLE.

101
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,620
WE EVEN SAW YOU HAVE A MOMENT
WHERE SOME BAMBOO EXPLODED, AND

102
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,537
IT BROUGHT IT ALL BACK.

103
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,165
DID YOU-- DID PEOPLE REACH OUT
TO YOU?

104
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:13,378
>> YES, YEAH, THERE ARE A LOT OF
VETS WHO REACHED OUT AND SAID

105
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,880
THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M GOING
THROUGH AND THANKS FOR, YOU

106
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,548
KNOW, BEING BRAVE AND SHOWING
THAT.

107
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,385
AND A LOT OF MY OLD BUDDIES THAT
I HAVEN'T SEEN FOR A WHILE, YOU

108
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,553
KNOW, HIT ME UP --
>> REALLY?

109
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,682
>> YEAH, IT WAS AMAZING.

110
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,808
>> Jeff: YOU'RE EMOTIONAL
ABOUT THAT.

111
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,893
>> I LOVE THOSE GUYS, YOU KNOW.

112
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,521
WE WENT THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER,
AND IT'S JUST NICE TO BE ABLE TO

113
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,689
TALK TO THEM.

114
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,524
>> Jeff: SO YOU HADN'T EVEN
TALKED TO THEM IN HOW LONG?

115
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,485
>> PROBABLY FOUR, FIVE, SEVEN
YEARS, EIGHT YEARS-- WOW.

116
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:41,197
>> Jeff: IT'S KIND OF
INTERESTING, YOU WERE ONLY

117
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,909
PERSON I THINK UP THERE THAT
KEPT A SECRET THIS SEASON, AND

118
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,703
IT PAID OFF.

119
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,705
BUT WE'RE ALSO PRETTY GOOD AT
KEEPING A SECRET, AND I HAVE

120
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,914
SOMETHING I WANT TO SHARE WITH
YOU.

121
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,500
COME DOWN HERE WITH ME BECAUSE
WE HAVE THREE OF YOUR BUDDIES

122
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,254
WHO WANTED TO COME OUT HERE AND
REUNITE WITH YOU.

123
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:09,559
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BEN'S FORMER MARINE BUDDIES.

124
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:15,189
GUYS, COME OVER HERE.

125
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,567
GOTTA GET THE HAT, MAN.

126
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,402
BEN LOVES HIS HAT.

127
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:25,908
COME ON OVER, BEN.

128
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,785
NOW, THIS IS-- THIS IS A LEGIT
SURPRISE.

129
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,329
AND I'LL TELL YU-- WHY WE DID
THIS.

130
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,540
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY JUST TRACKED
SOME OF YOU GUYS DOWN TO SEE

131
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,209
WHAT IMPACT IT WAS HAVING OW.

132
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,587
AND THE SECOND WE BROUGHT IT UP,
ALL THESE GUYS SAID, "CAN WE

133
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,421
COME?

134
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,423
CAN WE TELL BEN HOW MUCH IT
MEANS?"

135
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,594
GUYS-- WHO WANTS TO SPEAK-- BUT
WHY WAS IT SO IMPORTANT THAT BEN

136
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,096
WAS OPEN ABOUT THE P.T.S.D.?

137
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,434
>> MAN, WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEN IN
12 YEARS.

138
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,312
AND LAST TIME WE SAW HIM, HE
WASN'T IN A GOOD PLACE, SO TO

139
00:05:54,395 --> 00:06:00,318
SEE HIM COME FROM WHERE WE LEFT
OFF TO NOW, COULDN'T BE MORE

140
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,444
PROUD OF YOU, BROTHER.

141
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,779
>> Jeff: IS IT PART OF IT
BECAUSE IT TAKES SOMEBODY TO

142
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,614
STEP UP AND SAY, "I'LL SHOW YOU.

143
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,866
I KNOW I'M A MARINE, BUT I'LL
SHOW YOU.

144
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,992
I HAD SOME HARD TIMES."

145
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,745
IS THAT PART OF WHY THIS IS SO
IMPORTANT TO GET WORD OUT.

146
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,246
>> YEAH, EXACTLY.

147
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,793
IT'S NOT JUST FOR US THAT WE
WATCH, WE SEE WHERE WE CAN GO.

148
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:22,006
BUT PEOPLE IF HE PULLS ONE VET
OUT OF THE GUTTER BY HIS STORY,

149
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,466
THAT'S HUGE.

150
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,675
>> RIGHT ON.

151
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,930
>> Jeff: A SUPER COOL REUNION,
AND THIS IS WHAT COMES FROM BEN

152
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,681
BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO TELL HIS
STORY.

153
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:35,186
AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS
RIGHT NOW AND IT FEELS LIKE YOU,

154
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,605
YOU KNOW, YOU THINK YOU'RE
SUFFERING FROM P.T.S.D., REACH

155
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,815
OUT AND ASK FOR HELP.

156
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,652
THERE'S A U.R.L. ON THE SCREEN
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS WHY HE

157
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,487
OPENED UP TO SHOW YOU THERE CAN
BE A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE

158
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,655
TUNNEL.

159
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,490
WE'RE LIVE IN LOS ANGELES.

160
00:06:47,573 --> 00:07:00,128
WE'LL BE BACK FOR MORE FINALE
AFTER THIS.

161
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,297
>> Jeff: WELL, SO LIKE I SAID
AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW, ONE BIG

162
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:08,177
IDEA WE HAD WAS LET'S MAKE THIS
THE SEASON OF SECRETS.

163
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,513
AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE
CENTERED AROUND SECRET

164
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,015
ADVANTAGES AND SECRET IDOLS AND
THE PLAYERS THAT HAD THESE

165
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,518
SECRET ADVANTAGES WERE GOING TO
SHOCK ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS

166
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,811
BECAUSE THEY HAD A SECRET AND
THEN NOBODY COULD KEEP A SECRET.

167
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:25,736
TAKE A LOOK.

168
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,696
>> SO I FOUND AN ADVANTAGE.

169
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,073
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE ELSE.

170
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,241
>> I GOT IT.

171
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,534
>> YEAH!

172
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,704
>> THE FACT THAT COLE KNOWS THAT
I HAVE THE IDOL COULD BACKFIRE.

173
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,707
BUT I DON'T THINK COLE HAS TOLD
ANYBODY.

174
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,708
>> JOE HAS THE IDOL.

175
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,584
WE FOUND IT PENTAGON.

176
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,878
>> OH, MY GOSH.

177
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,713
>> THIS ADVANTAGE IS YOUR SECRET
TO SHARE OR NOT SHARE WITH

178
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,589
ANYONE ELSE.

179
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,718
I FOUND A SECRET ADVANTAGE IN MY
CHIP BAG.

180
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,177
>> REALLY?

181
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,844
>> YEAH.

182
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,346
>> JESSICA FOUND AN ADVANTAGE.

183
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,055
>> HOLY COW.

184
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,683
>> SO JESSICA FOUND AN
ADVANTAGE.

185
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,561
>> I WILL BE USING YOUR LITTLE
SECRET TO MY ADVANTAGE.

186
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,855
>> THEY KNOW ABOUT MY ADVANTAGE!

187
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:01,522
>>
>> I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE

188
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:01,814
SCREWED.

189
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,648
>> WHY?

190
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,025
>> BECAUSE I HAVE AN IDOL IN MY
PANTS.

191
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,109
>> SHUT UP.

192
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,569
>> LET'S GET IT ALL OUT IN THE
OPEN WHAT, DO YOU KNOW?

193
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,738
>> RYAN HAS AN IDOL.

194
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,823
>> AND I FOUND A SECRET
ADVANTAGE AND IT'S STILL IN

195
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,741
PLAY.

196
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,785
>> NOBODY AROUND HERE CAN KEEP A
DARN SECRET.

197
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,870
THANK YOU, FAMILY.

198
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,414
I NEED THE IDOL, AND I AIN'T
TELLING NO ONE ABOUT IT.

199
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,498
>> LAUREN HAS THE ADVANTAGE.

200
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,753
>> DON'T REVEAL THAT YOU HAVE AN
IDOL OR AN ADVANTAGE!

201
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,088
>> Jeff: LAUREN, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

202
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,590
>> GOOD GAME, LAUREN.

203
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,134
>> Jeff: EVERYTHING WAS OUT IN
THE OPEN, AND YET THE ONE THING

204
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,805
THAT HAD THE MOST POWER WAS THE
ONLY SECRET.

205
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,808
>> SECRET, SECRET, SECRET.

206
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:46,609
<i>( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
>> Jeff: SO, LAUREN, LET'S

207
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,318
TALK ABOUT THIS.

208
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,737
THIS IS THE-- CAN WE SHOW THIS?

209
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,449
THIS IS THE SHELL THAT MIKE
THREW IN THE FIRE BECAUSE YOU

210
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,619
TOLD HIM HUIT, AND THEN YOU GAVE
IT TO HIM.

211
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,828
ANY REGRETS?

212
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,790
OR IS IT-- AND I'M BEING-- I'M
NOT JOKING-- DO YOU REGRET THAT,

213
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,208
OR WAS THAT A MOVE THAT YOU MADE
AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK?

214
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:02,792
>> NO, I REGRET IT 100%.

215
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,627
I CAN HAVE IT BACK?

216
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,920
CAN I HAVE IT BACK?

217
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,088
>> Jeff: NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
BACK.

218
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:14,136
BUT I LOVE THAT YOU REGRET IT
BECAUSE THIS AND THIS-- DOES

219
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,805
ANYBODY HERE REMEMBER WHAT THIS
IS?

220
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,683
ANYBODY RECOGNIZE THIS?

221
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:24,730
EXACTLY, JAMES'-- JAMES IN
"SURVIVOR: CHINA" SEASON 15, SO

222
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,984
10 YEARS AGO, HE HAD TWO OF
THESE IN HIS POCKET.

223
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,694
HE GOT VOTED OUT WITH BOTH OF
THEM.

224
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,698
THIS AND THIS IS ANOTHER CLUE TO
WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT SEASON.

225
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:39,120
BAD DECISIONS FROM FORMER
PLAYERS COMING BACK TO HAUNT.

226
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:52,383
ALL WILL BE REVEEM REVEALED WHEN
RETURN.

227
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,678
>> Jeff: ONE OF THE BEST PARTS
OF THIS JOB IS WHEN WE COME UP

228
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,722
WITH A NEW IDEA THAT WE REALLY
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DIG AND WE

229
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,806
HAVE ONE.

230
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:04,145
IT'S DIFFERENT, BIG, SUPER FUN
FOR OUR 36th SEASON WE

231
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,232
DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING THAT
SPEAKS TO THE PAST 35 SEASONS,

232
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,194
AND REALLY GETS AT THE HEART OF
WHY "SURVIVOR" IS SO FUN TO

233
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,071
WATCH AND SO DIFFICULT TO PLAY.

234
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,623
>> Jeff: "SURVIVOR."

235
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:29,253
IT IS THE MOST COMPLICATED GAME
OF SOCIAL POLITICS EVER CREATED.

236
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,047
>> THIS ISN'T ABOUT MAKING
FRIENDS.

237
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,884
I NEED THAT ADVANTAGE.

238
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,718
IT WORKED.

239
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,511
>> Jeff: THERE IS NO ONE TO
RELY ON.

240
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,220
MICHAELA.

241
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:38,846
>> WHAT!

242
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,222
>> Jeff: NO ONE TO TRUST.

243
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,098
>> DID YOU DO THAT?

244
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,767
>> YEAH.

245
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,934
DIIT.

246
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,728
>> Jeff: EVERYTHING RESTS ON
YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE THE RIGHT

247
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,729
DECISION.

248
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,066
>> I WANT TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY TO NATALIE.

249
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,317
>> Jeff: ...AT THE RIGHT TIME.

250
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,862
>> YOU'LL OFFICIALLY GO DOWN AS
THE DUMBEST IN THE HISTORY OF

251
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,905
"SURVIVOR" EVER.

252
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,741
>> Jeff: BECAUSE ONE BAD
DECISION... THE TRIBE HAS

253
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,367
SPOKEN.

254
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:07,875
...CAN HAUNT YOU FOREVER.

255
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:16,092
THIS IS "SURVIVOR," GHOST
ISLAND.

256
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:21,597
THE GRAVEYARD FOR BAD "SURVIVOR"
DECISIONS.

257
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,265
>> I ROLLED THE DICE TOO MANY
TIMES.

258
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,934
I HAD THE TWO IDOLS.

259
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,685
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE PLAYED
THEM.

260
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,019
>> Jeff: AND AFTER 35 SEASONS
--

261
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,978
>> OOPSY.

262
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,980
>> Jeff: ...THERE HAVE BEEN A
LOT OF THEM.

263
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:35,778
THIS IS NOT A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

264
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,115
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, A NEW
GROUP OF PLAYERS WILL HAVE THE

265
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,285
CHANCE TO REVERSE THE CURSE OF
SOME OF THE WORST DECISIONS IN

266
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,954
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

267
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:49,875
AN ENTIRE SEASON CENTERED AROUND
THE BAD DECISIONS OF PAST

268
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,292
PLAYERS.

269
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:50,835
>> OH, MY GOD.

270
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,086
IT'S NOT THE IDOL!

271
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,714
>> WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

272
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,260
>> Jeff: USING THE ACTUAL
ADVANTAGES AND IDOLS THAT DID

273
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,010
THEM IN.

274
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,471
>> HE GAVE ME A PIECE OF THE
IDOL.

275
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,975
DO THE "SURVIVOR" GODS MAKE HER
PAY FOR IT OR NOT?

276
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,185
>> Jeff: WILL THESE NEW
PLAYERS LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES

277
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,353
OF OTHERS.

278
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,522
>> IT'S THE STUPIDEST MOVE YOU
COULD EVER MAKE IN THE GAME.

279
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,608
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT
MISTAKE.

280
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,986
>> Jeff: OR WILL THE PAST COME
BACK TO HAUNT AGAIN?

281
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:22,366
>> YOU HAVE GOT TO LISTEN TO
YOUR GUT EVEN MORE THIS SEASON

282
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,534
THAN EVER BEFORE.

283
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,288
