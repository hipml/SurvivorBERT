00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,752
PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,170
<i>Survivor,</i> the physical nature

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,255
of the game took its toll on

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:05,630
Yaxha.

5
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,090
>> Everybody over here at Yaxha

6
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:07,882
has these things all over

7
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:08,091
them.

8
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,592
Got a long way to go on the game

9
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,677
so probably gonna get a lot

10
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,428
more banged up than this.

11
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,345
>> PROBST: At the challenge the

12
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,680
tribes competed for a sweet

13
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,222
reward.

14
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,016
Today you are playing for

15
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,267
chocolate.

16
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,810
>> Oh, my God.

17
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,436
Also, the winning tribe will get

18
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,438
a chance to take part in a zip

19
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,149
line canopy tour of the jungles

20
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,650
of Guatemala.

21
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,109
Survivors ready? Go.

22
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,028
Nakum fell behind.

23
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,321
Bobby Jon is out.

24
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,698
Nakum panicking.

25
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,283
As Yaxha sprinted to victory.

26
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,703
Yaxha wins reward.

27
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,163
Flying high from their win,

28
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,456
Yaxha took the ride of their

29
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,331
life.

30
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:40,957
>> We got to swing through the

31
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,667
jungle on these cables and felt

32
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,711
just majestic.

33
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,670
>> PROBST: And at the end of the

34
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,296
tour they found their chocolate

35
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,130
feast.

36
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,299
>> I'm gonna remember today for

37
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,175
two reasons.

38
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,593
The day I went rip cording

39
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,052
through a jungle, and the day

40
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,096
that I ate the most chocolate

41
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,639
I have ever eaten in my

42
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,974
entire life.

43
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:58,558
>> PROBST: The next day Yaxha

44
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,311
surprised Nakum with a visit.

45
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,562
>> Hi!

46
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,480
>> Oh, what are you guys up to,

47
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,439
man?

48
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,356
>> It's my birthday so we

49
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,399
figured we would invite you for

50
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,692
a pool party.

51
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,777
>> PROBST: At the party, Jamie

52
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,320
didn't like the idea of the two

53
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,613
tribes meeting.

54
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,447
>> I was worried that maybe

55
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,281
Stephanie was getting along too

56
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,157
well with other people, maybe

57
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,825
she would, you know, form bonds

58
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,534
there.

59
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,368
I'm here for business.

60
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,203
And everyone else should be

61
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,120
also.

62
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,121
>> PROBST: For immunity the

63
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,915
tribes raced to unearth pieces

64
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:22,916
of a puzzle.

65
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,667
They're heavy with that sand.

66
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,919
The game was close but Nakum

67
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,588
assembled their puzzle first.

68
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,632
Nakum wins immunity!

69
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,967
Back at Yaxha, Amy felt she was

70
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,343
next to go.

71
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,386
>> I knew going into this if we

72
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,055
didn't win the immunity I had an

73
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:37,388
uphill battle.

74
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,140
>> PROBST: But Brandon and Danni

75
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,892
were still undecided.

76
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,726
>> I was hoping it wouldn't come

77
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,477
to this, you know?

78
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,311
>> Yeah.

79
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,230
>> I'm conflicted because here I

80
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,024
have my alliance with Bobby Jon,

81
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,359
but I believe that Gary and Amy

82
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,361
maybe deserve to be here a

83
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,739
little bit more than he does.

84
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,824
>> PROBST: With Bobby Jon and

85
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,617
Amy both at risk, the tribe

86
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,203
voted out the weaker of the two.

87
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,330
Then the game took an unexpected

88
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,790
turn.

89
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,500
The four of you will not go back

90
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,626
to your camp.

91
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,293
You will go directly to Nakum's

92
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,254
camp.

93
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,005
All of your personal items, all

94
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,674
the rewards you've won, will be

95
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,050
relocated.

96
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:14,676
You are going to merge into one

97
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,803
new tribe.

98
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,513
Ten are left, who will be voted

99
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,932
out tonight?

100
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,852

(animals calling)

105
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,651
>> We just went to Tribal

106
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,652
Council and then Jeff turns to

107
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,112
us and says here is your new

108
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:58,738
buffs, you are not going back to

109
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,032
your camp, you are heading over

110
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,576
to Nakum for a merge.

111
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,298
>> We were walking up to the

112
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,633
Nakum camp for the first time;

113
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,052
myself, Danni, Brandon and Gary,

114
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,346
and we just told each other

115
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:23,930
look, hey, we're in this thing

116
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,682
together, and we don't know

117
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,476
what's going to happen.

118
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,230
>> I twisted my ankle.

119
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,398
>> It was real tough for me to

120
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,358
walk in here tonight because I

121
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,484
can't be around Stephanie for

122
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,568
more than five minutes without

123
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,653
wanting to vomit.

124
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,779
And I can't be around Jamie for

125
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,947
more than five minutes without

126
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,948
wanting to knock him out.

127
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:42,865
So I don't know what I'm going

128
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,909
to do.

129
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:45,535
>> We have some new buffs for

130
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,787
you.

131
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,788
>> Hey!

132
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,373
>> Oh, my God.

133
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,624
>> Gary.

134
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,583
>> What's up, big fella?

135
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,334
>> Gary.

136
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,544
>> What's going on?

137
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,545
What happened?

138
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,506
>> Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

139
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,009
>> Who got voted out?

140
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,176
>> Amy.

141
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,136
>> They brought us straight

142
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,178
from tribal.

143
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,221
>> Are you freaking kidding?

144
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,390
>> Merge, baby, merge.

145
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,101
>> Hey, ya'll, why don't you

146
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,519
come over here and get a buff.

147
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,729
>> These are nice, huh?

148
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,314
>> And they don't stink.

149
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,109
>> Yaxha came here immediately

150
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,402
after Tribal Council and

151
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,987
basically gave us new buffs and

152
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,571
told us there was a merge.

153
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,906
So we were all thrown for a

154
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,782
loop.

155
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,451
My head is, like, spinning.

156
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,076
>> Come on, let's get that fire

157
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,495
started.

158
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,791
>> I just came into camp and

159
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,001
started doing my thing, man.

160
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:35,626
Right when I started getting the

161
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,754
fire, here comes Jamie over

162
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,463
there.

163
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,131
>> There's not room in the

164
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:40,381
shelter.

165
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,007
I hope they don't mind sleeping

166
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,009
outside.

167
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,135
>> He said something smart, I'm

168
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,428
just like, "Dude, you going

169
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,721
to say one more thing to me I'm

170
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,014
going to knock every one of your

171
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,184
teeth slam out of your head."

172
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,195
>> Ooh. Is that a log?

173
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:02,779
>> Yeah.

174
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,032
>> Wow!

175
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,453
>> Bobby Jon is just looking for

176
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,955
something to do, man.

177
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,123
(laughter)

178
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:14,832
>> I ain't trying to be the

179
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,625
hero.

180
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,250
>> You gonna chill out, brother,

181
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,087
or what?

182
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,670
>> This morning woke up, and,

183
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,506
you know, like I mean it wasn't

184
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,674
a dream after all.

185
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,093
We really merged and everything.

186
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,302
And you know, a new tribe.

187
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,762
And you think, "Whee," you know,

188
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,098
one big happy family.

189
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,851
That's not how it works.

190
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,478
(scoffs)

191
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,729
>> I don't think we have any

192
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,605
more wood to get.

193
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,439
I think you're okay.

194
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,525
Why don't you sit down?

195
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,445
>> Nakum, we came over...

196
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,280
I didn't think they were that

197
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:46,656
warm and friendly.

198
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,866
Brandon, Bobby Jon and myself,

199
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,867
I think Gary does, too,

200
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,244
we feel kind of like we are

201
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,578
slaves, because we know our

202
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,663
head's on the chopping block and

203
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,540
we will try to do what you can

204
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:55,915
to stick around.

205
00:06:55,998 --> 00:07:01,003
But you feel like an outsider.

206
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,380
>> This whole deal kind of

207
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,339
sucks.

208
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,507
You know, there's four of us

209
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,968
from the Yaxha tribe and six of

210
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,178
them from the Nakum tribe.

211
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:09,846
>> Now we can make room on the

212
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,513
fire.

213
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,180
Should we put it on the grill or

214
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,598
what?

215
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,892
>> I think myself or Bobby Jon

216
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,977
are probably gonna be first on

217
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,103
the chopping block.

218
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,312
We are probably most likely to

219
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,355
get immunity, so they want to

220
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,190
get those guys out first.

221
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,650
And things aren't looking very

222
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:28,865
up to tell you the truth.

223
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,783
>> I hope it's not a freakin'

224
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,868
Reward Challenge.

225
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,077
We'll open tree mail and

226
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,121
there'll be a pig inside.

227
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,206
>> Or a Mayan feast.

228
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:37,874
Oh, my God.

229
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,125
It's a basket.

230
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,960
It's a basket.

231
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,170
What is it?

232
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,212
>> Okay, here we go.

233
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,213
>> "Congratulations, you are now

234
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:44,505
one tribe.

235
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,966
Here's your new flag and paints

236
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,593
for you to add to your new tribe

237
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:48,801
name.

238
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,803
If you are feeling bored around

239
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,221
camp or could use some peace of

240
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,723
mind in this game, there is a

241
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,725
small individual immunity idol

242
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,436
hidden in the woods.

243
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,729
This is in addition to any

244
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,605
individual immunity you win at

245
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,564
challenges.

246
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,483
It is about six inches tall and

247
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,568
is made of stone."

248
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,819
>> What?

249
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,613
>> "Find it and you have power.

250
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,739
You can use it at any time to

251
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,740
save yourself.

252
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,782
"You don't need to tell anyone

253
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,034
you have it, but if are you

254
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,327
going to use it, you must

255
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,661
"present it at any Tribal

256
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,913
Council before the vote."

257
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,164
>> "But the idol's powers expire

258
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:18,748
when are you down to the Final

259
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,666
Four."

260
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,627
>> So hidden somewhere in the

261
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,213
woods there is an idol that will

262
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,839
give us immunity that we can use

263
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,673
at any Tribal Council up to the

264
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,675
Final Four.

265
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,594
Somewhere there's individual

266
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,971
immunity hidden in the woods

267
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:38,142
to use any time you want.

268
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,479
>> We got tree mail saying that

269
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,356
there's a little immunity idol

270
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,900
about this big in a jungle

271
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:52,740
that's this big.

272
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,618
>> So the search is on.

273
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,619
Finding the secret immunity idol

274
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,788
could be huge for anyone.

275
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,165
If you use it right, you can

276
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,124
almost guarantee yourself to the

277
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,961
Final Four.

278
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,337
>> You checking this area out?

279
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,088
>> I think it's going to be

280
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:07,838
someplace around the temple,

281
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,756
don't you?

282
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,799
>> If I find the idol, I am not

283
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,675
telling anybody.

284
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,300
I wouldn't come prancing into

285
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,635
camp saying, "Hey, I found the

286
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:12,802
idol."

287
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,721
No way. I wouldn't do it.

288
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,057
>> It's going to be like finding

289
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,767
a needle in the hay stack.

290
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,769
You could be looking for days

291
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,145
and days and days for the damn

292
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,855
thing and still not find it.

293
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,274
And I got a target right on my

294
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,733
head, you know.

295
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,236
And so I could really use it.

296
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,154
Like, really.

297
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,491
>> Got to find that idol, man.

298
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,862
>> Bobby Jon was looking for the

299
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,946
idol.

300
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,489
And he said, "I'm not asking for

301
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,116
an alliance or anything like

302
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:17,325
that."

303
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,368
He's like, "I'm just asking to

304
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,578
help me out so at least I make

305
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,704
the jury this time."

306
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,205
And I said, you know, "I totally

307
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:23,831
understand but I can't make any

308
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,750
promises."

309
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,668
It's going to be either him or

310
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,713
Brandon that goes.

311
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,397
>> Good morning, everyone.

312
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,274
So, have we thought of a name?

313
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,360
Anybody?

314
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,402
>> What's that?

315
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,447
>> Have we thought of a name?

316
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,282
>> What are you thinking, Cindy?

317
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,159
>> Take the two names and blend

318
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,410
them.

319
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,536
>> Yeah.

320
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,662
>> Xhakum.

321
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,580
>> I like that.

322
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,374
That sounds catchy.

323
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,085
Ba-ba-boom, Xhakum. Hey!

324
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,503
>> I wanted to get our new

325
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,588
Xhakum flag started.

326
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,341
Xhakum to us means to us Yaxha

327
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,551
and Nakum put together.

328
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,720
So we are one big happy tribe,

329
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:19,970
right now.

330
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,722
Everything is A-OK.

331
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,848
>> Oh, it's so beautiful, you

332
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,891
guys.

333
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,477
>> That looks nice, huh?

334
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,603
>> Xhakum.

335
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,729
Very nice.

336
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,523
Look at that.

337
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,315
>> What's up?

338
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,316
>> The quest for the idol is

339
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,360
still under way.

340
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,195
I can tell you where it is

341
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,363
not, back there.

342
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,906
>> It's not back there?

343
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:39,156
>> Mm-mm.

344
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,741
>> Also not back there.

345
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,785
>> That idol could be worth a

346
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,119
million dollars.

347
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,620
I have been looking for it

348
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,830
because I don't want any of the

349
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,248
old Yaxha to have it.

350
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,458
That would put a hurting on my

351
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:49,875
plan.

352
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,751
>> I've got to take a leak.

353
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,711
Maybe I will take a leak all

354
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,340
over that idol.

355
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,217
>> Me, Gary, Danni and Brandon

356
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,635
up here are sitting ducks pretty

357
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,594
much.

358
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,887
So I spend about an hour each

359
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,431
day looking for the immunity

360
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,558
idol, because I'm not done yet.

361
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,058
It's going to be found.

362
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,643
That's the thing.

363
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,061
It's going to be found for sure.

364
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,312
We just don't know when or who's

365
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,941
going to find it.

366
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,443
And you can drive yourself nuts

367
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,778
looking for it.

368
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,115
>> So you went to that place

369
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,408
over there where we get all the

370
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:22,616
wood?

371
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,200
>> I'm not even going to look

372
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,952
any more.

373
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,370
It's driving me crazy.

374
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,455
I have to take a break for a

375
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:27,955
little bit.

376
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,875
I mean I'm exhausted, man.

377
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,376
Up and down, up and down, up and

378
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,294
down.

379
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,838
>> Let's just go chill then.

380
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,756
>> I really want to find it.

381
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,049
I really feel like it's here but

382
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,469
I cannot find it anywhere.

383
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,720
And I'm horrible at looking for

384
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,679
things.

385
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,014
I'm just the worst person at

386
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,224
finding anything in the world.

387
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:47,850
So my odds of getting this

388
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,894
immunity idol are a little bit

389
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,271
low.

390
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,732
(<i> insects buzzing</i> )

391
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,900
I'm searching for the immunity

392
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,444
idol and I reach up and put my

393
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,405
hand, like, in a hornet's nest

394
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:05,493
at the top of this temple.

395
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,037
I just got attacked by hornets.

396
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,913
I'm done.

397
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,664
That was just the signal from

398
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,833
the Mayan gods that I am not

399
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:17,546
meant to find this idol.

400
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,012
>> What you doing there, big

401
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:25,638
guy?

402
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,388
>> I'm just going to make a

403
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,890
couple more flies up, just in

404
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,059
case.

405
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,060
>> For all those big fish we're

406
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,187
going to catch.

407
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,731
>> Yeah.

408
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,398
>> Right.

409
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,024
>> Fish fry.

410
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,317
>> Yeah.

411
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,236
I was really expecting

412
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,445
some sort of food.

413
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,655
Because it seems like in the

414
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,364
game of<i> Survivor</i> whenever a

415
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,950
season merges or the teams

416
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,535
switch, or anything big happens

417
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,077
where people come together,

418
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,538
there is always food involved.

419
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,206
And I mean, an immunity idol

420
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,582
like that is cool and all, but

421
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,542
we're like starving.

422
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,503
So I would much rather feast.

423
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,672
But whatever.

424
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,216
<i>Survivor.</i>

425
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:02,883
>> This will be the first time

426
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,219
there's ever a merge without

427
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,263
a celebration.

428
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,013
>> That's pretty sad.

429
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,641
>> I'm sad already.

430
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,809
>> You know, we had camp over at

431
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,310
Yaxha, it was positive.

432
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,728
We had fun.

433
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,104
We all got along.

434
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,064
And come over here, and it is

435
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,525
just like, they just complain

436
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,068
all the time.

437
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:21,360
>> Come on.

438
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,237
Two days into the merge already

439
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,447
and we didn't have a feast?

440
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,615
>> That's retarded.

441
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,242
>> I'm bored out of my mind,

442
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,286
too.

443
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,412
>> It was just so negative here

444
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,246
at camp.

445
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:32,913
I mean, just complaining about

446
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,999
not having food or not having

447
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,959
anything to do.

448
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,961
And so we just said we needed to

449
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,921
get out, get away for a little

450
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,756
bit.

451
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,632
Go fishing.

452
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,675
>> Do you want to go fishing?

453
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,301
>> Ready?

454
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,970
>> Yeah, fishing.

455
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,016
>> Keep dreaming, baby.

456
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,105
>> Is there any chocolate left?

457
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,023
>> Do we have any honey left?

458
00:14:59,106 --> 00:14:59,982
>> We are devils.

459
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,151
>> I don't care. They went

460
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,235
fishing and it's a slap in the

461
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,737
face, you know?

462
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,362
>> I can't believe they are all

463
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,448
really that dumb to all go

464
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,240
together.

465
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,700
>> If they were even strategic

466
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,826
they wouldn't have gone all

467
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:11,410
together to go fishing because

468
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,037
they wouldn't leave us six

469
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,205
here to plot our next plan.

470
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,123
>> You know, we can hang out and

471
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,168
eat honey while they go fishing.

472
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,587
I'm not, like...

473
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,255
I'm not totally cool with that

474
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,465
kind of like that kind of

475
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,924
attitude like we are in control

476
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:26,091
now.

477
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,635
So we don't have to do anything.

478
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,177
And we have to make them do

479
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,055
everything.

480
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,723
>> It's like we're at war, man.

481
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,183
Prisoners.

482
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,351
We have to do all their bitch

483
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,769
work and they get to raid all

484
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,896
our resources and all our other

485
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,356
stuff that we worked hard to

486
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,440
acquire.

487
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,316
>> They went right through our

488
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,734
stuff when we came over.

489
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,610
Didn't even ask.

490
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,362
>> Like a bunch of pigs.

491
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,154
>> All right, let's do this.

492
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,405
Whoever catches the biggest fish

493
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,239
goes home first.

494
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,407
>> Yeah, whoever catches the

495
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,326
biggest fish goes home first.

496
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,452
>> You guys are crazy.

497
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,539
>> How does that sound?

498
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,500
>> I kind of had this really sad

499
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,125
realization.

500
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,002
Am I a member of the axis of

501
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,713
evil?

502
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,839
>> Man, they better bring some

503
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,007
fish back.

504
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:07,966
>> They better get their ass up

505
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,009
tomorrow morning, too.

506
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,094
Before they catch a damn six

507
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,471
footer, man.

508
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,681
>> Bashing people when they are

509
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,683
not around to bring group unity

510
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,018
is not a pretty way to play this

511
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:18,227
game.

512
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,019
>> Let's make sure we got it.

513
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,231
>> So Brandon. Brandon...

514
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,982
>> Is that what we said?

515
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:24,566
>> Brandon, Bobby Jon and then

516
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,651
Danni.

517
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,821
>> Right.

518
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,115
>> Stephanie bitches a lot, man.

519
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,366
>> She sure does.

520
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,492
All they do is complain.

521
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,159
>> They complain so much.

522
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,662
Talk about food, complain.

523
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,538

it?

ahead and not worry about it,

535
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,222

Unfortunately, our beach is like

562
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,603
quicksand so it had to be

563
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,812
anchored out here, so we come

564
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,438
and go as a tribe, which is kind

565
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,774
of nice.

566
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,566
For those days that we're really

bored and our days off and

568
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,068
stuff, we just hang out here and

00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:54,448

00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,117
hanging out, kind of waiting on

572
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,118
tree mail, to be honest with

573
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,244
you.

574
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,040
I don't think, I don't know,

575
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,333
I just don't think that the

576
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,210
Nakum's fairy tale right now is

577
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,712
going to quite come true.

578
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,380
They really think that those six

579
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,465
are going to make it down to the

580
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,091
final six.

581
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,092
But for some reason I just don't

582
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,055
think that's going to happen.

583
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,267
>> It's a box.

584
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,311
>> What the heck?

585
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,063
>> What the heck?

586
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,940
>> I don't know.

587
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,485
A message.

588
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,071
>> "'I don't need practice,'

589
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,614
former Survivors have said,

590
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,199
'carrying a pot around on my

591
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:37,366
head.'

592
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,618
So if you feel safe,

593
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,119
"ignore this note, and be

594
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,204
prepared to cast your next

595
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:42,621
vote."

596
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,247
>> Balance a pot?

597
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,248
>> Holy cow.

598
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,166
Who wants to try it?

599
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,292
>> I bet Lydia is good, she has

600
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,877
a low center of gravity.

601
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,920
>> We just have to stand there

602
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,296
with a damn pot on our heads.

603
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,131
You're a pot head.

604
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:53,924
>> This is going to be the first

605
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,550
individual immunity challenge.

606
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,093
So it's going to be quite

607
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:56,844
interesting.

608
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,387
A lot of heads are going to be

609
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,304
rolling today.

610
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,597
>> I'm standing with it.

611
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,223
>> I can stand all day with it,

612
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,517
it's the walking.

613
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,936
>> That's the whole challenge.

614
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:06,562
>> I keep telling myself I'm not

615
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,438
out of this sucker yet.

616
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,356
Just get pumped up.

617
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,733
And that's what I got to do to

618
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,569
win because I've got a long road

619
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,570
ahead of me, if I'm going to do

620
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,865
this.

621
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,199
>> I have a dome-shaped head, so

622
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,618
I'm S.O.L.

623
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,080
>> Whoa!

624
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:37,009
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

625
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,136
>> Oh, my God.

626
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,725
>> Oh, my God.

627
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:49,688
>> Oh, God.

628
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,564
>> PROBST: How is everybody

629
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,148
doing?

630
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,232
>> Pretty good.

631
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,275
>> PROBST: First thing's first,

632
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,444
take back the idol.

633
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,403
And I will take back the old

634
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,405
buffs.

635
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,115
Don't need the buffs any more.

636
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,742
Immunity idol is of no longer

637
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,911
any value.

638
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,579
Individual immunity is what you

639
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,539
covet from here on out.

640
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,624
So catch me up.

641
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,541
What's the new name of the

642
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,417
tribe?

643
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,251
>> Xhakum.

644
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,252
>> PROBST: Xhakum.

645
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:12,753
How'd the merge go down?

646
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,378
There was a few of you guys

647
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,881
that were probably sleeping when

648
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:16,882
you got some visitors.

649
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,175
Jamie, what was it like for you?

650
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:18,800
>> I was thinking there is not

651
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,427
room in the shelter, hope they

652
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,304
don't mind sleeping outside.

653
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,264
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, what kind

654
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,807
welcome is that to say, "Hey,

655
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,808
you know, we don't have enough

656
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,185
room for everybody so some of

657
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:28,769
"you are gonna have to sleep

658
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,561
outside?"

659
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,395
>> I'm not going to

660
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,313
ever pour myself on anybody.

661
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,523
I would just soon as sleep in a

662
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,524
tree with the howling monkeys.

663
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:34,983
It don't matter to me.

664
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,485
I'm out here to play the game

665
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,361
and do what I've got to do.

666
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,487
>> PROBST: Cindy, anything you

667
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,030
expected coming with the merge

668
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,074
that didn't come?

669
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:42,699
>> I think we all expected some

670
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,952
sort of a snack or you know a

671
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,870
treat, some sort of celebration

672
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,454
because, you know, we've all

673
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,081
come together.

674
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,082
It's almost like you know, a new

675
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:50,749
start.

676
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,416
But here it was, all we have is

677
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,753
corn and nuts and hauling water.

678
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,921
>> PROBST: Well, it is true that

679
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,340
in the past part of the

680
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,008
tradition of a merge has been a

681
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,134
merge feast.

682
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:01,677
That tradition will continue

683
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,055
today, but with a twist.

684
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,848
If with Tribal Council looming

685
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,558
tonight you still feel very

686
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,309
secure in this tribe, don't

687
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,520
really think you need immunity

688
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,896
around your neck, you don't have

689
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,606
to participate at all.

690
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,108
Instead you can plop over here,

691
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:16,733
have a seat behind the feast and

692
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,736
eat and eat and eat.

693
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,321
If on the other hand you feel

694
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,656
like maybe are you a little bit

695
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,782
in trouble, your head might be

696
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,866
on the chopping block, you can

697
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,409
opt to take part in the

698
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,451
challenge.

699
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,412
But if you participate in the

700
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,831
challenge, you don't eat.

701
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,331
>> Oh, my God.

702
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,500
>> You will each have in your

703
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,752
hand one ramon nut and one jade

704
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,087
bead.

705
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,213
When I tell you to, you're

706
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:38,714
going to show me the one

707
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,257
that tells me what you want to

708
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,299
do.

709
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,635
Jade represents challenge.

710
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,470
Ramon nut means "I want to eat,

711
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,513
I'm not going to take part in

712
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,472
the challenge."

713
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,932
Everybody got your choice?

714
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,810
Three, two, one, reveal.

715
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,853
Rafe feels confident.

716
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:53,979
He's eating.

717
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:54,563
Take a spot over there behind

718
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,189
the feast.

719
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:56,982
Gary is going to participate in

720
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:57,441
the challenge.

721
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,025
Bobby Jon's gonna be in the

722
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,192
challenge.

723
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,610
Jamie is hungry, take a spot in

724
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,361
the feast.

725
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,071
Steph feels lucky, take a spot

726
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:03,447
in the feast.

727
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,365
Judd is going to participate in

728
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:05,699
the challenge.

729
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,659
Cindy is in the challenge.

730
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,452
Brandon is in the challenge.

731
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,536
Lydia is going to fill her

732
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,537
belly-- take a spot behind the

733
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,496
feast.

734
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,751
Danni is in the challenge.

735
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,585
You guys can go and take a

736
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,169
spot, but don't start eating

737
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,004
yet.

738
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:19,838
All right, let me explain the

739
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,839
challenge.

740
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,174
You are going to balance a clay

741
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,925
pot on your head for as long as

742
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,135
you can.

743
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:25,761
You cannot touch the pot with

744
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,054
your hands.

745
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:27,888
If you do you are out.

746
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,097
You cannot step off a small cube

747
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,849
which you will be standing on.

748
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,225
Last person left standing with

749
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,477
that pot on their head wins

750
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,353
immunity, is safe tonight at

751
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,438
Tribal Council.

752
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,523
If after one hour we are still

753
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,233
going, we will move to a tie

754
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,485
breaker.

755
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,820
Make sense?

756
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,615
We'll get started.

757
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,581
Everybody's pot is in place and

758
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:58,418
this challenge has begun.

759
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:03,924
You can start eating.

760
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,843
>> Oh, my God.

761
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,518
>> It's good.

762
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,647
>> This is so good.

763
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,778
>> PROBST: How's the food?

764
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,238
>> Good.

765
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,072
>> Mmm. Very good.

766
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:27,823
>> PROBST: Did you expect to see

767
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,033
four people sitting down to eat?

768
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:30,951
>> Brandon and Bobby Jon know

769
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,244
they have a chance to go home

770
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,078
tonight.

771
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:33,870
They are the best two athletes

772
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,621
in the group.

773
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,455
I think Judd wants to protect

774
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:35,705
our lead.

775
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,041
I look up to him for it.

776
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,167
>> I thought we were one tribe.

777
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,877
>> You know it's not one tribe.

778
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,253
>> Yeah, but...

779
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,254
>> So why are you saying that

780
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:42,546
right now?

781
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,922
>> Well, because I can.

782
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:44,589
And I will.

783
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,674
And I want to.

784
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,508
>> PROBST: Well, Jamie so you le

785
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,676
the cat out of the bag.

786
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,802
So clearly it is no big secret.

787
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,470
You said Judd is up there

788
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,556
"protecting our lead."

789
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,225
Whose the "our"?

790
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,395
It must be you four and Judd.

791
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,647
So it's tribal lines all the

792
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,940
way.

793
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:02,899
>> Yup.

794
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,692
>> I have been knowing the whole

795
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,985
time what is going on.

796
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,194
>> Bobby Jon, you knew you had

797
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,946
to win immunity today, bud.

798
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,282
>> I'm not trying to, it's just

799
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:10,907
when you start going off at the

800
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:11,575
mouth I'm ain't gonna let you

801
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:15,078
big boy me though.

802
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,419
>> PROBST: You are 30 minutes in

803
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,338
Never has 30 minutes seemed so

804
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,090
long.

805
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:31,011
>> Good job, Judd.

806
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,054
>> How are you doing, Bobby Jon?

807
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:33,555
Good?

808
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,849
>> Are you consciously trying to

809
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,101
rub it in?

810
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,040
>> PROBST: Danni makes the

811
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,460
slightest move, Danni's out.

812
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,837
Take a spot on the mat.

813
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,134
And we are reaching the end of

814
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,552
the hour.

815
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,973
Five, four, three, two, one.

816
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:17,933
You're there.

817
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,685
Cindy, Brandon, Gary, Judd,

818
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,396
Bobby Jon, moving on to a tie

819
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,522
breaker.

820
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,690
Slowly bring your hands up to

821
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,691
your pot.

822
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,734
Step down.

823
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,568
>> Good job, guys.

824
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,986
(applause)

825
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,737
>> PROBST: Let's go.

826
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,571
Head over to the pyramid.

827
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,949
For the tie breaker, you will

828
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:34,658
race up the steps of the

829
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,701
pyramid.

830
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,203
No hands can touch your pot at

831
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:38,703
any time.

832
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,456
First person to the top or the

833
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,582
person who goes the furthest,

834
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,001
without breaking their pot wins

835
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,419
immunity.

836
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,712
Here we go, guys. Survivors

837
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,299
ready?

838
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,635
Go!

839
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,594
Gary and Brandon moving out

840
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,553
quickly.

841
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,680
Bobby Jon right behind.

842
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,348
Cindy's out.

843
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,308
It's Gary and Brandon.

844
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,434
Bobby Jon coming up.

845
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:01,810
Brandon's out.

846
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,020
Bobby Jon's out.

847
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,982
>> Way to go Gary!

848
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,108
>> PROBST: Gary wins immunity.

849
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,192
Nice job.

850
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:13,280
>> Good job, guys.

851
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,994
>> PROBST: Gary, the only person

852
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,037
safe from Tribal Council tonight

853
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,124
unless someone finds the hidden

854
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:24,749
immunity idol or perhaps has

855
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,127
already found it.

856
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,128
You have the afternoon to figure

857
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,462
out who is going home.

858
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,380
See you at tribal.

859
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,924
Head on back.

860
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,153
>> I swear right now, I'm not

861
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,237
eating again.

862
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,447
>> I don't care what you do.

863
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,573
You guys can do whatever you

864
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:56,781
want.

865
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,782
I don't care what you do.

866
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,117
>> Unless everybody's going to

867
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,909
eat, I'm not eating.

868
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,161
>> You know me, I don't care

869
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:01,453
what you do.

870
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,704
You want to eat, you eat.

871
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,122
You don't want to eat, you don't

872
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:04,831
eat. I don't care.

873
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,082
I was just going in there to

874
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,417
compete, man. That's it.

875
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,505
>> Me? 'Cause you're so hot?

876
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,131
>> I think everybody should shut

877
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,841
up, I'm concentrating and you

878
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,761
keep yapping your mouth,

879
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,429
I'm like "Dude, shut up, man.

880
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,513
Shut up, man.

881
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,389
I can't listen to you right

882
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,558
now."

883
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,560
>> Yaxha, we came into the merge

884
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,062
with just four people.

885
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,605
And Nakum had six.

886
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,898
And so obviously Jamie called it

887
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,608
out today.

888
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,317
We knew our head was on the

889
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,901
chopping block.

890
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,443
But he really called it out

891
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,569
today.

892
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:35,695
I thought he was very cocky,

893
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,239
very arrogant and just a slap in

894
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,366
the face.

895
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,825
>> It wasn't like we were like

896
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,951
are not welcome here and get

897
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,913
lost.

898
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,127
>> Jamie did not show class at

899
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,712
the challenge whatsoever.

900
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,797
And I think everyone agrees on

901
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,964
that.

902
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,549
People are seeing this nature in

903
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,635
him, this immaturity and they're

904
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,844
not liking it very much.

905
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,596
Even Judd's just like, the

906
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,181
dude's got keep his mouth shut.

907
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,974
>> Dude, shut up, man, shut up.

908
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,684
Argue later or don't even argue

909
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,811
at all, man.

910
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,187
>> We told him again and again

911
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,146
just keep some of your thoughts

912
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,189
to yourself.

913
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,315
Because I think it's starting to

914
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,191
come around.

915
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,734
It may come around and get him.

916
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:19,406
>> I just feel so crappy today,

917
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,073
you know what I mean?

918
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:20,990
Because like, I know who I want

919
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,033
to be voting with.

920
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,201
>> Yeah.

921
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,369
>> I've kind of been asking

922
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,704
myself like why are you

923
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,415
sleeping with the devil,

924
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:28,623
almost.

925
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,999
And today at the feast it was

926
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,001
like everything just

927
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:32,877
crystallized in front of my

928
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,962
eyes.

929
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,298
I cannot respect myself and go

930
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,886
far in this game with Jamie.

931
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,971
>> We're just basically saying

932
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,390
that Jamie is getting a little

933
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,017
too cocky and he's not...

934
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,438
>> I am not going to tell him

935
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,063
anymore.

936
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,106
I'm not here to baby-sit nobody.

937
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,108
>> Right. And we've told him.

938
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,694
>> I told him twice.

939
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,240
>> Oh, we are supposed to stand

940
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,199
there and take it.

941
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:03,825
>> You didn't say a damn word.

942
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,286
You can't talk when we are in

943
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,245
the middle of a challenge.

944
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,413
>> I know.

945
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,038
>> Jamie is being an idiot right

946
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,748
now.

947
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,167
And he's sitting there, digging

948
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,710
his own hole in his own tribe.

949
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,752
He's probably going home

950
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,004
tonight.

951
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,715
I see these people in this

952
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,549
tribe, and they're like, they

953
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,049
can't take him anymore.

954
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,009
He's being arrogant, he's being

955
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,802
cocky.

956
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,304
All he does is mouth off and go

957
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,264
to challenges.

958
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,182
At the immunity challenge I was

959
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,058
thinking what if I slipped off

960
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,727
this platform with this bucket

961
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,352
on my head and smashed it over

962
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:35,356
his head?

963
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,612
>> I was telling Brandon, it

964
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,696
sucks, you know, but if you are

965
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:42,739
the best athlete here, you're

966
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,823
going to be going, you know?

967
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,160
>> I don't think like that.

968
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,662
I look at people's character.

969
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,747
>> If you had your choice, who'd

970
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,290
be going home?

971
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,166
>> Man, I ain't even thinking

972
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,292
about it right now, Jamie, to be

973
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,210
honest with you.

974
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,044
>> Because your head is not on

975
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:56,836
the chopping block, or what?

976
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,421
>> Huh? Is my head on the

977
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,255
chopping block?

978
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,089
>> I said it's not on the

979
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:00,882
chopping block, so you're just

980
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,132
chilling?

981
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,884
>> I'm not thinking about it.

982
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,843
I mean, dude, you know what?

983
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,387
if I do go home tonight, then I

984
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,222
go home.

985
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,264
>> But you know, Brandon's head

986
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,058
is on the chopping block.

987
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,519
>> I definitely wouldn't let

988
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,520
Brandon go home.

989
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,812
>> That is whose head is on the

990
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,064
chopping block today.

991
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,357
>> Well, I know mine is too.

992
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,443
>> Well, you, you say that but

993
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,444
you know Brandon's head is on

994
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,987
the chopping block.

995
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:23,905
>> Well, you're telling me it

996
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,322
is.

997
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,490
>> You know it is.

998
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,032
>> I know mine is, too.

999
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,159
>> I have been honest this whole

1000
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:28,910
game, told everybody what is up

1001
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,954
and you can't even tell me who

1002
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,248
are you sending home.

1003
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,457
If you think you'd like to see

1004
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,583
me go home, then just say it.

1005
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,418
>> No.

1006
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,878
>> We are all good farm boys so

1007
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,463
if you got to say something,

1008
00:30:40,547 --> 00:31:18,585
say something.

1009
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:29,387
>> Are you serious, man?

1010
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,013
>> I guess they could afford to

1011
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,472
lose one guy.

1012
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,932
They're still gonna have us

1013
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,518
outnumbered.

1014
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:37,937
>> I'll be damned, man, if it

1015
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:43,484
works out like that.

1016
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,405
I'm going to crap my pants if it

1017
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,199
works out like that.

1018
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,955
>> I bet you I'm better at

1019
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,957
crushing corn than you are.

1020
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,502
>> Is that a challenge?

1021
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,128
>> I just had this, you know, I

1022
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,297
have been mentally prepared for

1023
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,256
going home.

1024
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,466
I have been thinking about like,

1025
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,885
oh, man, going home, 21 days,

1026
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,761
three weeks.

1027
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,013
It was a good run, and you know,

1028
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,389
getting prepared.

1029
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,183
And now this comes by.

1030
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:27,153
(thunder rumbling)

1031
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,113
>> Finding that immunity idol

1032
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,615
would be awesome.

1033
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,116
But you don't know if you over-

1034
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,992
looked it.

1035
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:33,534
If you're not looking in the

1036
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,911
right spot.

1037
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,162
I mean, I could search out here

1038
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,246
all day long and not find the

1039
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,164
damn thing.

1040
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,499
Hell, it's only six inches big,

1041
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,750
and I don't even know what color

1042
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,502
it looks like.

1043
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,045
I guess really I'm hoping that

1044
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,505
this one deal goes through and

1045
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,090
uh, Jamie gets booted off rather

1046
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,009
than... not myself.

1047
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,135
People have been saying that

1048
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,345
the whole time, like, "This

1049
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,221
is<i> Survivor."</i>

1050
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,806
Things get pushed around, it

1051
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,640
will change.

1052
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,891
Something will happen.

1053
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,518
And something is starting to

1054
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,728
happen.

1055
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,948
>> If we do what's right, we

1056
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,574
vote for Jamie.

1057
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,660
If we do what's right.

1058
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,745
Integrity and what's right.

1059
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,329
There are five voting against

1060
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,791
him, that's numbers.

1061
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,751
>> Yeah, but then like,

1062
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,669
you know, where does that leave

1063
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,297
us?

1064
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:32,218
>> Still on top, because then

1065
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,178
there's nine.

1066
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,316
>> Cindy, hey, do whatever you

1067
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,192
need to do, you know what I

1068
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,318
mean?

1069
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,028
It's your thing.

1070
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,244
>> But do what you need to do.

1071
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,542
>> I don't know. I don't know

1072
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,460
what to do.

1073
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,544
It's really difficult.

1074
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,714
I told the numbers of six, that,

1075
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,007
you know, I'm voting for Brandon

1076
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,967
because that is what we decided.

1077
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,010
But my heart tells me to vote

1078
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,762
for Jamie because I think

1079
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,013
Brandon deserves to be here more

1080
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,097
than Jamie.

1081
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,307
But this game is not about who

1082
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,558
you care the most about because

1083
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,726
at some point you have to get

1084
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,227
rid of everybody if you are

1085
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:23,561
going to win.

1086
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,188
So it is really very difficult.

1087
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,106
I won't know until I write the

1088
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,234
name down on the paper.

1089
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,927
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1090
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,054
today's events, a lot going on

1091
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:58,346
out there.

1092
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,264
Some people choosing to eat,

1093
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,224
some taking part in the

1094
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:01,516
challenge.

1095
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,267
Rafe, were you are surprised

1096
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,268
when Jamie said "Judd's up there

1097
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,313
to protect our lead," implying

1098
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,689
he's up there to protect this

1099
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,232
alliance.

1100
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,151
>> For me it was hard to hear

1101
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,611
the comments Jamie was making,

1102
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,988
just because I didn't want it to

1103
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,448
become something like us versus

1104
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,282
them or six versus four or

1105
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,535
anything like that.

1106
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,702
Which I guess was a little bit

1107
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,038
naive in the game of<i> Survivor.</i>

1108
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,623
This is a game about numbers.

1109
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,916
But this is also a game about

1110
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,501
respecting each other and, like,

1111
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,794
I get really frustrated when we

1112
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:30,378
don't do that.

1113
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,337
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, where does

1114
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,296
it sit with you?

1115
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,132
>> I just thought that was just

1116
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:34,757
no class.

1117
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,633
I mean, for somebody to sit

1118
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,759
there and say, you know, "Go

1119
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,260
Judd, whoo-whoo."

1120
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,344
I'm just like that is just no

1121
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,721
class.

1122
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,682
I mean yeah, it's 6-4, whatever,

1123
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,933
I know that.

1124
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:44,433
That was just no class.

1125
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,393
>> I have class.

1126
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,394
So he can think what he wants to

1127
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,311
think.

1128
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,187
I'm the bigger man.

1129
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,189
>> Man, just shut up, dude, I

1130
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,399
mean, God.

1131
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,483
>> Bobby Jon, I think no class

1132
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,568
is when you have a chance for

1133
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,569
immunity but you knew you had

1134
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,528
the numbers so you didn't even

1135
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,279
ask for it.

1136
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,196
You thought you were too good to

1137
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,488
ask for it.

1138
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,322
>> 'Cause I knew that night I

1139
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,199
was safe and I am an adult.

1140
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,200
>> Try and let the people battle

1141
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,244
for it who need it.

1142
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,371
>> Brian needed immunity that

1143
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:05,580
night.

1144
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,289
He could have asked for it.

1145
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,082
He didn't get it and I could

1146
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:08,624
have gone home.

1147
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,500
And Jeff was sitting right

1148
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:09,959
there.

1149
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:10,835
>> You weren't trying to save

1150
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:11,377
Brian, though.

1151
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:11,961
>> I don't even know what you

1152
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,045
are saying, man.

1153
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:13,880
>> I don't even know what you

1154
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:14,797
are saying, but...

1155
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,299
>> Stop. Stop.

1156
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,258
>> I will let you have what you

1157
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:17,592
want to have.

1158
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,677
>> Okay, okay.

1159
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,887
>> No one says I have no class.

1160
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,013
You know, that is just

1161
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,014
disrespectful.

1162
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,015
I didn't disrespect him like

1163
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:24,891
that.

1164
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:25,725
I'm sorry I didn't play in that

1165
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,852
game today, but we we'll see who

1166
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,687
the bigger man is on the field.

1167
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,023
(Bobby Jon scoffs)

1168
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,485
>> PROBST: Cindy, why were you

1169
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,820
in the challenge today?

1170
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,071
You seem to be a part of this

1171
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,531
magic six.

1172
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,532
>> For me, I can eat when I get

1173
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,491
home.

1174
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,242
But I'll never have the chance

1175
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,285
to do what I'm doing here ever

1176
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,369
again.

1177
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,287
And I'm going to do it as hard

1178
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,288
as I can.

1179
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,956
And yeah, it kind of hurt my

1180
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,291
feelings a little bit, made me

1181
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,792
feel like this group of six

1182
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,960
people didn't have the faith in

1183
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,629
me that they have in Judd.

1184
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,796
But I stood there for an hour

1185
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,131
just as long as Judd did.

1186
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:57,715
I did everything I possibly

1187
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,634
could, you know.

1188
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,760
It makes things run through your

1189
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,428
head like, "Well, then, who am

1190
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,554
I, just standing here for the

1191
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,180
heck of it?"

1192
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,641
I'm an idiot for standing here?

1193
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,142
>> PROBST: Gary, is it fair to

1194
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:09,602
say that the six people fighting

1195
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,854
for immunity today deserve to

1196
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,272
stay in this game more than the

1197
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,315
four who chose to eat?

1198
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,275
>> You know, my hope would be

1199
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,526
that everybody votes their heart

1200
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,945
and not their mind.

1201
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,321
Because at day 21 your mind can

1202
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,948
play tricks on you.

1203
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,282
But when you leave this game and

1204
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:23,908
39 days are over, your heart is

1205
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,077
going to be one that's gonna

1206
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,412
tell you what's right and wrong.

1207
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,455
>> PROBST: Cindy, at this

1208
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,539
point in the game, what do you

1209
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,415
base your vote on?

1210
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,918
Is it as Gary said, heart and

1211
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,503
morality and who deserves it, or

1212
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,338
is it "As long as it ain't me"?

1213
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,465
>> I think spending the time

1214
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,716
that we spend with people out

1215
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,759
here and getting to know people

1216
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,219
and the level that you do, that

1217
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,845
your morals and your heart

1218
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,681
definitely come into play a

1219
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,848
great deal.

1220
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,474
It's impossible to block it out

1221
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,352
if you even have a heart.

1222
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,603
So it definitely comes into play

1223
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,605
when you are making a decision.

1224
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,399
It does for me.

1225
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,483
>> PROBST: Okay, before we get

1226
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,986
to the vote, an immunity idol

1227
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,195
was hidden at your camp.

1228
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:03,114
If anybody has found that and

1229
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,157
you want to use it, now is the

1230
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,327
time to present it.

1231
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,162
Okay.

1232
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:10,788
Either nobody has found the idol

1233
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,623
or they just don't want to

1234
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,084
reveal it at this time.

1235
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,752
Gary has individual immunity,

1236
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,753
he's the only one you cannot

1237
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,504
vote for.

1238
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,339
Everybody else is fair game.

1239
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:20,715
It's time to vote.

1240
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,885
Judd, you're up.

1241
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:36,564
>> I have the utmost respect for

1242
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,940
you.

1243
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,358
We bled together and we fought

1244
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,193
together, you are a good man.

1245
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:45,865
I'm sorry you had to go.

1246
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,709
>> You talk about having

1247
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,084
Southern pride.

1248
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,004
Well, part of having Southern

1249
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,338
pride is being a Southern

1250
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,548
gentleman.

1251
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,258
And no, you don't have any class

1252
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:07,511
at all.

1253
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,439
>> PROBST: I will go tally the

1254
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,400
votes.

1255
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:31,994
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

1256
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,037
read, the decision is final.

1257
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,080
The person voted out will be

1258
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:34,663
asked to leave the Tribal

1259
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,831
Council area immediately.

1260
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,375
I will read the votes.

1261
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:43,964
First vote, Brandon.

1262
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:49,678
Brandon, two votes Brandon.

1263
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,347
Jamie.

1264
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,306
Two votes Brandon, one vote

1265
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,559
Jamie.

1266
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,936
Jamie.

1267
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,020
Two votes Brandon, two votes

1268
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,565
Jamie.

1269
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,359
Brandon.

1270
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,360
That's three votes Brandon,

1271
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:08,572
two votes Jamie.

1272
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,491
Jamie.

1273
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:14,537
We're tied three votes each.

1274
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,831
Brandon.

1275
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,165
That's four votes Brandon,

1276
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:23,003
three votes Jamie.

1277
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,213
Jamie.

1278
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,214
Tied again.

1279
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,090
Four votes Brandon,

1280
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,968
four votes Jamie.

1281
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,636
Brandon.

1282
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,720
Five votes Brandon,

1283
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,471
Four votes Jamie.

1284
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:42,648
One vote left.

1285
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,983
Ninth person voted out of

<i>Survivor: Guatemala,</i> Brandon.

1287
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,654
You need to bring me your torch.

1288
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,078
>> You're the sister I never

1289
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:59,540
had.

1290
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:01,709
>> PROBST: Brandon, the tribe

1291
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,713
has spoken.

1292
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,466
Time for you to go.

1293
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,637
>> Good luck, guys.

1294
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,101
>> PROBST: Well, you have made

1295
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,603
it to the Final Nine.

Two of you will make it to the

Final Two, the other seven will

1298

make up the jury.

1299
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,734
18 days left, a lot can happen.

1300

One thing is certain, everything

00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,654
you've done up until now and

everything you do from here on

out matters.

1304

Grab your torches.

1305

Head back to camp.

1306

00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,187
intensifies.

1322
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,896
>> I'm going to pull out

1323
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:04,897
everything I can to try and get

1324
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,482
as far as I can.

1325

1330
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,080
here to play, and I think

00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,748
I played a pretty good game,

1332
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,250
