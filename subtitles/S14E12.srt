<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,963
>> That was brilliant.

4
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:05,588
>> PROBST: With the four

5
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,257
horsemen's alliance broken,

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,591
Alex and Mookie were on the

7
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,384
outs.

8
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,176
>> We are six strong, and

9
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,138
there's two people just waiting

10
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,640
on death row.

11
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,599
>> PROBST: In a desperate

12
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,059
attempt to save their necks,

13
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,144
Alex and Mookie searched

14
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,228
through Yau-Man's bag.

15
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,062
>> Yeah, he got it.

16
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,106
>> PROBST: And discovered his

17
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,315
hidden immunity idol.

18
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,859
>> Just cause some hell, man.

19
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:26,484
If I'm going down, I'm bringing

20
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,902
hell with me.

21
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,237
>> PROBST: When Alex and Mookie

22
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,946
confronted Yau-Man...

23
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:30,572
>> What do you want to do, Yau?

24
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,574
>> You guys do what you need to

25
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,074
do.

26
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:33,950
>> PROBST: ...he decided to

27
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,076
tell everyone about the idol.

28
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,369
>> I thought that was a little

29
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,912
dirty, but I will have to tell

30
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,914
all my voting bloc straight out.

31
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,957
They went through my bag.

32
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,000
>> They went through your bag,

33
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:42,250
Yau-Man?

34
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,209
>> Yeah, they went through my

35
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:43,543
bag.

36
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,502
>> Alex went through Yau-Man's

37
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,670
things and threatened him.

38
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,296
They said, "I know you have the

39
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,298
immunity idol."

40
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,340
>> Finding out that Yau-Man had

41
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,592
the immunity idol changed a

42
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,634
whole bunch of stuff because

43
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,802
everybody with the immunity

44
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,514
idol is considered dangerous.

45
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,307
>> PROBST: At the reward

46
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:57,849
challenge...

47
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,224
Mookie connects!

48
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,643
...The tribe was split into two

49
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,019
teams.

50
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,604
Dreamz has it!

51
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,522
Green wins reward!

52
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,190
Dreamz secured victory for

53
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,275
himself, Stacy, Earl and Alex.

54
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,903
Boo, head on out.

55
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,279
And they sent Boo to Exile

56
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,947
Island...

57
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:13,490
>> "The idol is back at your

58
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,241
very own beach."

59
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,075
>> PROBST: ...Where he

60
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,202
discovered the first clue to a

61
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,953
newly hidden immunity idol.

62
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:19,329
>> It's not here.

63
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,205
It's not my beach.

64
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,290
>> PROBST: At the immunity

65
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:22,582
challenge...

66
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,792
>> D-4.

67
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,293
>> PROBST: D-4 is a hit.

68
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,128
Alex out.

69
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,129
Stacy wins individual immunity.

70
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,340
...Stacy came out on top.

71
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,216
Stacy, safe from tonight's

72
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,342
Tribal Council.

73
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,134
You are not.

74
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,969
There's somebody going home.

75
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:40,517
Back at camp:

76
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,643
Fearing that Alex or Mookie

77
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,811
could easily stumble upon the

78
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,853
newly hidden immunity idol, Boo

79
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,896
convinced his alliance to split

80
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,981
their vote.

81
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,154
Earl and Yau-Man, however, were

82
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,239
uneasy with the plan.

83
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:00,537
>> Going into tonight's Tribal

84
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,747
Council split vote worries me

85
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,623
very much.

86
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,709
I really... rather not see it.

87
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,836
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council...

88
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,295
You cannot vote for Stacy.

89
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,381
Everybody else is fair game.

90
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,340
It's time to vote.

91
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,341
Alex, you're up.

92
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,801
...in a last-ditch effort to

93
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,219
save himself, Alex turned on

94
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,763
Mookie and helped vote him out.

95
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,431
The 11th person voted out and

96
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,016
the fifth member of our jury:

97
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,560
Mookie.

98
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,645
Mookie, the tribe has spoken.

99
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,732
Well, based on what I heard

100
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,568
tonight, Alex is either odd man

101
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,903
out or suddenly very valuable.

102
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,155
Seven are left.

103
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,448
Who will be voted out tonight?

104
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,552
>> Tonight's vote was pretty

105
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,803
important for me.

106
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,680
I know Mookie voted for Boo.

107
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,765
I voted for Mookie.

108
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,811
>> My vote for Mookie is what

109
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,813
saved my ass, basically.

110
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,397
I was like, I'm gonna write

111
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,649
down his name, go with my gut.

112
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,234
So I'm still here.

113
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,653
(laughs)

114
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,739
Yup, still here.

115
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,254
>> I would have preferred Alex

116
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,213
would go.

117
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,007
Alex is more of a threat, but

118
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,009
for some strange reason, they

119
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,135
wanted to split the vote

120
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,012
between Mookie and Alex, and no

121
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,055
one considered the fact that,

122
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,264
hey, did you ever think that

123
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,557
Mookie and Alex have a vote?

124
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,850
That they might vote for each

125
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,852
other? Duh.

126
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,145
>> I don't want there to be,

127
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,188
like, some kinda rift between

128
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:50,730
you and I.

129
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,356
I'm willing to say if I'm wrong,

130
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,649
I'm wrong.

131
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,274
>> Whatever. You know.

132
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,443
It's not that big a deal.

133
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,654
After Tribal Council, Stacy

134
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,696
approached me, you know, trying

135
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,989
to clear things up, telling me

136
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,282
how she wants to be friends with

137
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,785
me after this. Like I care.

138
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,293
>> So I understand...

139
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:17,131
>> Who's "everybody?"

140
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,841
>> Everybody besides you and

141
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,303
Alex.

142
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,972
>> At this point, they're all

143
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,098
stressing out.

144
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,599
Obviously, they're not all in

145
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,517
agreement.

146
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,727
That always creates room and

147
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,436
opportunity.

148
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,729
>> Why am I... Why are y...

149
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,814
What's going on?

150
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,898
>> We're asking you a question.

151
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,899
>> I don't know.

152
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,192
>> No, because Boo came over and

153
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:36,818
he's like, "Everybody wants to

154
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,069
talk to you."

155
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,112
>> He just wants to know.

156
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,697
>> My best bet was to just lay

157
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,907
low, observe, let them get at

158
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,950
each other a little bit.

159
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:44,993
From this point forward, I

160
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,286
think I'm gonna have to play

161
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,162
this game with a smile, you

162
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,455
know, velvet gloves and a

163
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,541
dagger in my pocket.

164
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:29,954
(theme song playing)

165
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,956
♪ ♪

166
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,582
>> I definitely feel like I'm

167
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,459
on the chopping block still.

168
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,045
So after last night, I decided

169
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,504
I'm going into ninja mode and

170
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,547
it started this morning, right?

171
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,339
I woke up.

172
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,632
I could have gone up, you know,

173
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,925
gone around, done my business as

174
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,218
I normally do, but instead I

175
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:44,802
just kinda laid there and just

176
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,553
kinda listened, tried to see,

177
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,638
okay, who's still here?

178
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,890
Who's still at the campfire?

179
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,224
Like, it's all about observation

180
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,893
for me, and I'm trying to make

181
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,062
sure I'm not seen or heard,

182
00:05:54,145 --> 00:06:02,487
kinda like a ninja right now.

183
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,489
>> Yau I trust 100%.

184
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,074
>> Mm-hmm.

185
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:06,616
>> I only trust Yau and you

186
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,868
100%.

187
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,953
>> Oh, okay. Good.

188
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,346
>> Dreamz has been proving

189
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:28,721
himself.

190
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,180
>> Mm-hmm.

191
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,473
>> You know, he can be a little

192
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,682
rogue at times with his

193
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,683
strategy.

194
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,601
>> I'd look into that.

195
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,937
I always felt that I could rely

196
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,646
on Dreamz.

197
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,816
>> The core alliance is myself,

198
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,401
Cassandra and Yau, but me and

199
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,444
Cassandra talked about taking

200
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,446
Dreamz to the top four.

201
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,447
Then we can just have the, the

202
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,449
core four.

203
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,492
That's what they're called,

204
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,577
the core four.

205
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,165
>> I mean, honestly, my concern

206
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,707
is you and Dreamz are tight.

207
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,751
I mean, I don't see you voting

208
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,837
him out...

209
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,672
So I'm, just saying,

210
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,465
mathematically, I'm off to my

211
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,551
thing, you know.

212
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,431
Earl and I have a major

213
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,142
disagreement as to who the top

214
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,393
four should be.

215
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,146
His idea of the top four is

216
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,565
myself, Earl, Cassandra and

217
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,567
Dreamz.

218
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,154
That is a very bad top four for

219
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,905
me to get to the next stage

220
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,741
because Cassandra and, and

221
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,160
Dreamz are very close.

222
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,953
I would like a very weak

223
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,164
candidate up there, but the

224
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,748
very weakest is Stacy, I know.

225
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,792
I hate the idea; I really do.

226
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,294
I wish it was Michelle.

227
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,171
I would like to see the top

228
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,589
four as myself, Earl, Cassandra

229
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,216
and Stacy because then I have

230
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,509
a chance of getting to the top

231
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,595
three.

232
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,920
>> I trust Yau-Man, but Yau-Man

233
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:24,962
is definitely playing the game

234
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,755
for himself.

235
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,590
Yau has immunity idol, and so

236
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,133
I think Yau-Man is a real big

237
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:29,675
threat.

238
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,968
I know he's playing the game

239
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,261
and he's playing the game hard.

240
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,304
He's playing it like street

241
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,389
ball: he's playing it to win it.

242
00:08:51,906 --> 00:09:01,666
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

243
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,253
How's everybody doing on day 31?

244
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,088
>> We all are tired out here.

245
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:07,922
>> Hungry.

246
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:08,589
>> PROBST: Hungry?

247
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,216
Hungry plays in nicely to

248
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,259
today's challenge.

249
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,301
Shall we get to it?

250
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:12,510
>> Yes.

251
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,261
>> Do it!

252
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:13,886
>> PROBST: For today's

253
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,764
challenge, you are going to rip

254
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,725
pieces of meat off a large

255
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,769
piece of pork using only your

256
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,020
teeth.

257
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,313
Each time you get a mouthful,

258
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,356
you'll drop it in your

259
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:25,898
plate.

260
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,816
Whoever has the most meat on

261
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,235
their plate at the end of five

262
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,069
minutes wins reward.

263
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,112
Want to know what you're

264
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:31,612
playing for?

265
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,071
>> Yeah.

266
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:32,780
>> Yeah.

267
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:33,990
>> PROBST: Tomorrow the winner

268
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,575
and the first two runners-up

269
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,994
will be picked up by helicopter,

270
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,287
flown to one of the most

271
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,830
beautiful places in Fiji.

272
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,789
Then you will river-raft the

273
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,124
rain forest.

274
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:43,874
>> Oh... wow!

275
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,834
>> PROBST: It is truly

276
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,876
spectacular.

277
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,211
You'll then have a nice lunch,

278
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,879
come back to camp.

279
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,839
In addition, the winner of this

280
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,300
challenge will send one person

281
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,758
to Exile Island.

282
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,927
Finally, the winner of this

283
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,804
challenge will also receive an

284
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,639
advantage in the next immunity

285
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,724
challenge.

286
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,267
Take your spot.

287
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,310
We'll get your hands tied

288
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,602
behind your back and we'll get

289
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,565
started.

290
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,316
Here we go.

291
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,318
For reward and an advantage in

292
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,944
the next immunity challenge.

293
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,573
Survivors ready?

294
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,325
Go!

295
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,201
You got five minutes to tear

296
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,745
off as much pork as you can and

297
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,913
get it on your plate.

298
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,332
There are no lanes.

299
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:29,920
This is a free-for-all.

300
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,672
Dreamz and Earl getting a good,

301
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:31,964
quick start.

302
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:43,934
Alex with a nice big piece.

303
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,603
Yau-Man, Boo, Cassandra working

304
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,562
together.

305
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,064
Nobody working with Alex.

306
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,358
Boo with a<i> huge</i> piece.

307
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,361
Yau-Man with a nice big chunk.

308
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,362
>> Cassandra.

309
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,196
>> PROBST: Yau-Man looking for

310
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,364
some help from Cassandra.

311
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:56,781
You need two people.

312
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,740
One to hold it steady.

313
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,950
One to tear it off.

314
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,786
Dreamz with another big piece.

315
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,079
Alex in it.

316
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:07,625
Cassandra still in it.

317
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,126
Alex staying in it.

318
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,381
Yau-Man with a<i> huge</i> chunk!

319
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,802
Earl picking it up off the dirt.

320
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,969
Yau-Man and Boo working

321
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:19,720
together using their shoulder,

322
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,472
using their chins.

323
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,182
Yau-Man with another huge chunk

324
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:31,232
of pork.

325
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,650
Boo gets a big chunk.

326
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,359
Boo is in it.

327
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,652
Cassandra is in it.

328
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,069
Yau-Man is in it.

329
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,363
Alex with another big piece.

330
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,823
It's going to be very close.

331
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,366
One and a half minutes left in

332
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,244
this challenge.

333
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:52,920
Dreamz is in it.

334
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,048
Alex not giving up.

335
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,929
15 seconds.

336
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,764
Whatever is in your mouth when

337
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,475
I call time also counts.

338
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:12,481
Five, four, three, two, one,

339
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:12,815
stop!

340
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,109
That's it!

341
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:15,651
Whatever you have in your

342
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:19,488
mouth, put on your plate.

343
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,129
Start with Boo.

344
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,924
Boo weighs in at 8.9 pounds.

345
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,302
Boo, take a spot right up here.

346
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:45,890
For now, you are in first place.

347
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,850
Yau-Man weighs in at six pounds.

348
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,769
Yau-Man, currently in second

349
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,733
place.

350
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,526
Cassandra comes in at 5.8

351
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:57,943
pounds.

352
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,280
Take a spot up here, Cassandra.

353
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,950
Stacy in at 4.3 pounds.

354
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:09,371
You can stay there.

355
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,873
Earl, not enough.

356
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,752
Five pounds.

357
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,337
Dreamz at six pounds also.

358
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,299
Dreamz, you replace Cassandra.

359
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,260
One plate left.

360
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:23,928
If this is under six pounds,

361
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:28,390
you're out of the reward, Alex.

362
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,938
It is not going to be enough.

363
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,023
Boo wins the challenge.

364
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:36,315
>> Finally!

365
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,983
>> PROBST: Yau-Man and Dreamz,

366
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,859
first runners-up.

367
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,569
You're going along with him on

368
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,737
the reward.

369
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,488
All right, Boo, first order of

370
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,697
business.

371
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,657
Since you won the challenge,

372
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,241
you earn the right to send one

373
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,661
person to Exile Island.

374
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,958
>> Earl, I know you don't take

375
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,000
hard feelings to this.

376
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,169
I'm going to send you back.

377
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,420
>> PROBST: Head on out.

378
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,505
Boat will pick you up.

379
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,256
You'll be back in time for the

380
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,967
next immunity challenge.

381
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,512
Boo, this is your advantage for

382
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,514
the next immunity challenge.

383
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,598
You can ponder how that might

384
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,016
come into play.

385
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,600
It will all make sense at the

386
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,060
next challenge.

387
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:13,644
All right, guys, head back to

388
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,188
camp.

389
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,033
>> Here it comes.

390
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,869
>> That's the one right there.

391
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,622
Get a helicopter ride!

392
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,415
All right, ladies and

393
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,709
gentlemen, keep the camp safe.

394
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,710
We'll do what we can do.

395
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,712
>> You guys have fun.

396
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,630
>> I won the reward challenge

397
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,508
yesterday, along with Boo and

398
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,760
Dreamz, and we start out the

399
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,012
day with a helicopter ride.

400
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,180
I've never been on a helicopter.

401
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,932
Very excited.

402
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,268
>> Fly like the birds.

403
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,979
>> I know. Right?

404
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:57,980
>> Wow!

405
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,940
This is so cool!

406
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,693
>> For real.

407
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,278
>> I'll be back!

408
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,321
>> Being in a helicopter flying

409
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,489
was truly amazing flight for

410
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,867
somebody like me who grew up on

411
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,243
islands like this, and to see it

412
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,995
from the air was just an amazing

413
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,204
experience.

414
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,497
>> Now we're going through the

415
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,124
rain forest.

416
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,584
>> Wow!

417
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,544
We're living<i> la vida</i> large!

418
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,211
>> How much you think it cost to

419
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,504
rent one of these?

420
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,130
I wouldn't mind spending, like,

421
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,716
$600 or $700 on a really nice

422
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,217
date.

423
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,011
I'd do it big like that, Dreamz.

424
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,555
>> There's Exile Island right

425
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,890
there.

426
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,432
>> What's up, Earl?

427
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,642
What's up, Earl?

428
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,102
Holy moley!

429
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,063
I still can't believe it.

430
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:44,151
We rolling up in here, folks!

431
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,863
Oh, this is comfortable.

432
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,036
>> During the reward, Boo was

433
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,537
talking a lot, just trying to

434
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,081
be... I don't know.

435
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,332
He was just talking too much.

436
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,750
>> Hello.

437
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,251
Can you hear me, Dreamz?

438
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,420
Hello.

439
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,838
>> It's relaxing time, you know?

440
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,048
It's time to chill.

441
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:06,340
We won this.

442
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,007
Let's relax.

443
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,759
Let's live it up.

444
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,344
It's just annoying.

445
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,262
>> I'm hungry.

446
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,306
We're going whitewater rafting,

447
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,599
the most beautiful place in

448
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,225
Fiji.

449
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,226
>> Oh, wow!

450
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,102
What a ride!

451
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,646
It was just unbelievable.

452
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,439
And about an hour and a half

453
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,857
into the trip, the helicopter

454
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,818
landed, and we had to hike for

455
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,152
about ten minutes to get to the

456
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,487
river.

457
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,488
>> So, personally, you guys, I

458
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,155
want to welcome you guys.

459
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:30,739
The name of this river is the

460
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,157
Apananuli.

461
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,409
Secondly, it's really fast and

462
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,034
so strong.

463
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,036
>> So we were given a little

464
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,913
safety briefing, and we got

465
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,290
into a raft with the river

466
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,792
guide, and then we went down

467
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,546
this rapids.

468
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,810
>> Then we went whitewater

469
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:00,728
rafting.

470
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,353
Probably never do it again, but

471
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,272
it was so fun.

472
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,648
And I wish I could take my

473
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,816
family or somebody on a trip

474
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,692
like that so they can

475
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,777
experience what I experienced.

476
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,528
>> Look at that!

477
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,446
Waterfall.

478
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:10,946
Now, that's a waterfall.

479
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,572
>> It's like a field trip for

480
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,240
grown people.

481
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,158
>> We're floating around in a

482
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,242
postcard here.

483
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,076
You cannot get better than this.

484
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,454
I told myself ten times, "Look

485
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,246
at this.

486
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,289
Take it in.

487
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,540
Look where you're at."

488
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,250
I am absolutely dumbfounded.

489
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,127
I mean, I'm tickled pink.

490
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,171
I feel like a little girl.

491
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,257
>> This is great.

492
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,400
>> This is what I came here for.

493
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,944
"Clue number two: Your normal

494
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,489
winding paths you'll walk.

495
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,783
It's inside a tree near a

496
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,993
lonely tower of rock."

497
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,953
I'll figure it out.

498
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,121
I think two clues will be

499
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,748
enough for me.

500
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,707
Can't wait to get back to camp

501
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,918
to go looking for that idol.

502
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,254
It would be all worth it.

503
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,265
>> Oh, is that caviar?

504
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,559
Oh, this is good beef.

505
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,727
>> That is awesome!

506
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,646
>> Look at that!

507
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,648
>> That's impressive, Dreamz.

508
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,273
>> We finally got to lunch, it

509
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,691
was just so much stuff.

510
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,317
And I just kept eating it.

511
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,193
We were back at camp living

512
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,654
like cavemen in the dirt,

513
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,073
having nothing, and living like

514
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,741
a broke, homeless guy, to living

515
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,620
like you're rich.

516
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,288
>> The best, best part is, at

517
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,083
the end of the lunch, our river

518
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,334
guide came over and gave each

519
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,419
of us an envelope.

520
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,215
And in the envelope are

521
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,801
letters from home.

522
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,219
>> "Dear Daddy, Miss you so

523
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,137
much.

524
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,806
I got six "A"s and one "B" in

525
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,558
algebra on my report card."

526
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,059
Why can't you get a "B" in

527
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,562
Spanish or something? Man!

528
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,271
Yeah!

529
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,731
>> I'm going to read mine.

530
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,066
"Hey, Boo, your dad and sister

531
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,276
are doing really well.

532
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,443
Your dad's horses are eating

533
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,403
well.

534
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,654
Dad's kids are eating well

535
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,822
also."

536
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,782
Everybody is eating well.

537
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,784
See, my family thinks...

538
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,870
Thanks, Mom.

539
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,621
Oh, what a bonus, huh?

540
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,499
Am I crying yet?

541
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,542
How you doing, Dreamz?

542
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,419
You all right?

543
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,379
>> When I read my sister's

544
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,630
letter, you know, she said a

545
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,132
lot of deep stuff.

546
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,091
She was saying that she never

547
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,217
thought that one of us would

548
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,635
have a chance, a opportunity.

549
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,761
She thought it was over for the

550
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,554
family.

551
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,138
You know, she thought that our

552
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,223
opportunity was up until, you

553
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,266
know, I had the opportunity to

554
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,852
come here, and it really touched

555
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,062
me that it was me that had the

556
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,355
opportunity to come, you know?

557
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,232
>> Dreamz!

558
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,943
>> It lets me know that she

559
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,320
still believes in me even if I

560
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,156
don't believe in myself, so it

561
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,782
really brought a lot out of me.

562
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,909
It lets me know that my fight

563
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,619
is just beginning.

564
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,537
I know what I got to do now.

565
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,539
I remember my purpose here.

566
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,415
>> This is the best reward yet,

567
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,583
you guys.

568
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,292
>> It's the best yet.

569
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,544
>> Awesome!

570
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,399
>> My mom said, "I know you can

571
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,484
make a good situation out of

572
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,443
anything.

573
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,569
You can't get tired of people."

574
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,487
>> But, with Boo, you get tired

575
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,446
of him.

576
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,280
He talks more than the girls

577
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,365
talk.

578
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,407
>> I'm not really tired of him.

579
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,410
It's just the talking.

580
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,334
>> During the helicopter ride,

581
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,127
Boo just almost spoiled the

582
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,003
trip for us.

583
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,171
He definitely just talks too

584
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,382
much.

585
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,217
Why don't you stop saying

586
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,718
stupid stuff?

587
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,552
>> He's been like that since

588
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,720
day one.

589
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,554
>> I cannot handle any more.

590
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,305
I'm not going to lie to you

591
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,098
people.

592
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,099
I cannot handle any more.

593
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm losing it.

594
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,227
Boo has been irritating enough

595
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,811
to where I don't think these

596
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,437
people want Boo to get the

597
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,772
$1 million.

598
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,314
So, if somebody starts Boo

599
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,315
bashing, I'm going to feed the

600
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,358
fire.

601
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,902
I cannot deal anymore.

602
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,655
Sorry, guys.

603
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,156
If I hear something stupid, I

604
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,491
may call it out, and it may

605
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,701
cause friction.

606
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,285
People are not going to want to

607
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,537
see certain people win and,

608
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,830
right now, I don't see Boo

609
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,331
winning a popularity contest,

610
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,416
so if I can help steer things

611
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,376
in an anti-Boo campaign, I am

612
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,462
all for it.

613
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,231
>> I never liked Boo, and I

614
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,607
want Boo gone before Alex.

615
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,234
Alex is still fighting strong,

616
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,318
so I'm still making plans with

617
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,069
Alex.

618
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,529
So, point-blank, I'm just not

619
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,364
going to let Boo win.

620
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:10,871
>> I'm going to try my

621
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,913
damnedest, you know that.

622
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,083
You do the same.

623
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,793
If Boo wins immunity today, I

624
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,502
think I'm pretty much screwed.

625
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,589
Boo has a full belly and an

626
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,299
advantage in the next immunity

627
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:22,591
challenge.

628
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,634
But I need to keep myself alive

629
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,303
in this thing, so I am focusing

630
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,679
all of my energy, all of my

631
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,349
willpower on the challenge.

632
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:47,449
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

633
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,910
We'll now bring in Earl,

634
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,412
returning from Exile Island.

635
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,164
>> Bula.

636
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,375
>> Bula Bula.

637
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,459
>> Great to see you.

638
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,795
>> Welcome back, Earl.

639
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,046
>> PROBST: Are you guys ready

640
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:01,630
to get to today's challenge?

641
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,340
>> Let's do it.

642
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:03,965
>> PROBST: First things first,

643
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,177
Stacy, take back immunity.

644
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,556
Thank you.

645
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,767
Once again, immunity is back up

646
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,434
for grabs.

647
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,519
All right, at the last reward

648
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,896
challenge, Boo, you won an

649
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:18,563
advantage in today's immunity

650
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,439
challenge.

651
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,274
Did you bring it with you?

652
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:26,571
>> Yes, I did.

653
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,615
>> PROBST: Those are climbing

654
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,533
steps, and they are a big part

655
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,910
of today's challenge.

656
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,078
Boo, because you already have

657
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:33,662
your steps, you do not have to

658
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,705
participate in the first round

659
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,581
of this challenge.

660
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,500
You move on to the final.

661
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,503
For the rest of you, on my

662
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,630
"go," you will race to dig up

663
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,507
your three climbing steps that

664
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,175
are buried in the sand.

665
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,218
When you have all three, you

666
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,511
race to the finish.

667
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,679
The first two people to get

668
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,306
their climbing steps join Boo

669
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,267
in the final.

670
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,935
For the final round, you will

671
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:57,602
use those climbing steps to help

672
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,188
you get to the top of a 12-foot

673
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,023
pole.

674
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,192
First person to get to the top,

675
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,945
grab their flag, wins immunity,

676
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,530
stays alive in this game.

677
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,531
For the rest of you, after 33

678
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,783
days, somebody will be going

679
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,534
home tonight at Tribal Council.

680
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,536
Make sense?

681
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,495
>> Yeah.

682
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,121
>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots,

683
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:20,041
we'll get started.

684
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,376
All right, here we go.

685
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,002
First two people to finish join

686
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,087
Boo in the final round.

687
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,297
Survivors, ready?

688
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,673
Go!

689
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,134
You're looking for three paddle

690
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,596
steps buried in different

691
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,517
places in everybody's lane.

692
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,771
Alex going after it, on a tear.

693
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,773
Cassandra barely making a dent

694
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,317
in that sand.

695
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,444
Yau-Man making his way down the

696
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,320
course.

697
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:55,118
Is he deep enough?

698
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,661
Dreamz has his first paddle

699
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,080
step!

700
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,957
Alex tearing up a lot of sand,

701
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,000
no luck.

702
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,585
Coming back to a new spot.

703
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,670
Cassandra, digging like a small

704
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,464
rabbit, as if it's going to be

705
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,757
buried one to two inches.

706
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,009
Yau-Man trying a very

707
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,552
interesting method-- hugging

708
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,889
that sand.

709
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,599
Dreamz has his second climbing

710
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,851
step.

711
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,394
Stacy digging but finding

712
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,896
nothing.

713
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,148
Alex has a huge hole.

714
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,026
Still no climbing step.

715
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,110
Pick up the pace!

716
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,946
You can rest later!

717
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,739
Or you can rest tomorrow, just

718
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,617
not at the beach.

719
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,160
Dreamz has his third climbing

720
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,204
step.

721
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,997
Dreamz moving on to the final

722
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,624
round with Boo.

723
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:49,631
One more person moving on.

724
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,549
Yau-Man has his first climbing

725
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,801
step.

726
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,802
Now Yau-Man knows how deep they

727
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:58,306
are.

728
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,016
Alex has his first climbing

729
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,767
step.

730
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,730
You're looking for three total.

731
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,357
Alex getting all of the sand

732
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,858
out of his lane and moving most

733
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,151
of it out onto Yau-Man's

734
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,279
course.

735
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,322
Yau-Man putting his sand back

736
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,326
in Alex's lane.

737
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:18,910
Alex has his second climbing

738
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,162
step.

739
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,664
Alex now with two climbing

740
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,748
steps.

741
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,127
Yau-Man has one.

742
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,878
Cassandra just waiting for it

743
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:33,800
to be over.

744
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,510
Alex has his third climbing

745
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,053
step.

746
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,723
And with that, Alex moves on to

747
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,349
the final round with Boo and

748
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:51,609
Dreamz.

749
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,861
For the final round, we have

750
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,488
Boo, Alex, and Dreamz.

751
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,990
First person to stand on top of

752
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:57,782
the post and grab their flag

753
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,701
wins immunity.

754
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:04,247
Survivors, ready?

755
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,791
Go!

756
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,920
Boo up quickly.

757
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:15,842
Alex right behind.

758
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:20,847
Boo skipping several cleats.

759
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,891
Alex scaling to the top!

760
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:35,570
Can he pull it off?

761
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:39,866
Boo is up there!

762
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,620
Boo wins immunity!

763
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,164
>> Yeah!

764
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,207
Yeah!

765
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:47,832
(cheering)

766
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,793
>> PROBST: That's three people

767
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,794
who desperately wanted immunity.

768
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,630
That is not the easy way to do

769
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:57,509
this challenge.

770
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,635
Boo not even waiting for an

771
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,596
invitation.

772
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,725
>> Give it to me, Jeff.

773
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,851
>> PROBST: Boo safe from the

774
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,478
vote tonight.

775
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,105
Yau-Man, Earl, Stacy,

776
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,482
Cassandra, Dreamz, and Alex,

777
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,067
somebody going home tonight.

778
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,321
I'll see you at Tribal.

779
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,684
>> Fortunately for us, the

780
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,686
person who we wanted to vote out

781
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,688
today did not win the immunity

782
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,856
necklace, so... Alex will get

783
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,608
voted out today.

784
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,151
>> Can we sit here and say,

785
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,777
well, everybody right now,

786
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,571
Alex's name, please?

787
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,655
>> No, I'm going to give him

788
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:01,990
this necklace.

789
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:02,949
>> I'll freakin' tackle you.

790
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,285
That would be the greatest

791
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,287
Tribal Council ever 'cause we'd

792
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,955
be fighting all in there.

793
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,999
>> Today I'm feeling quite safe

794
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,333
because we have all agreed that

795
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,377
Alex is the odd man out and

796
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,837
needs to be taken out, so I'm

797
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,880
feeling safe enough that I do

798
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,466
not think I will need to use my

799
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:26,389
hidden immunity idol.

800
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,640
>> The situation is grim.

801
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,850
But, you know, I'm not going to

802
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,059
approach these people with

803
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:30,852
desperation.

804
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,436
I'm not going to beg for my

805
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,353
life.

806
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,104
That's not the way it works for

807
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,147
me.

808
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,940
Right now, taking an aggressive

809
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,400
approach to anything would be a

810
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,735
bad idea, especially given my

811
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,111
position.

812
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,154
I think the people that I need

813
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:41,946
to talk to will talk to me.

814
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,907
I think they'll approach me.

815
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,658
I think I've earned enough of

816
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,327
their respect they'll all at

817
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,536
least want to say something to

818
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,957
me before tonight's vote.

819
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,085
>> Hey, Alex.

820
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:56,503
>> Hey, Cassandra.

821
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,837
>> I hate to see you back down

822
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,255
here by yourself.

823
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,006
>> I'm okay.

824
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:00,924
I'm just tired.

825
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,718
>> You're just tired?

826
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,970
I know we started out

827
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:06,846
together...

828
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,264
>> Yeah, we did.

829
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,432
>> Just relax.

830
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,808
You should be very proud of

831
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,684
yourself.

832
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,310
We all are.

833
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,478
>> Yeah, I tried to be a

834
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,395
gentleman, you know.

835
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,814
I tried to give it my all and

836
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,233
do something that my kids could

837
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,028
be proud of someday.

838
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:46,010
>> Oh, okay.

839
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,013
Mm-hmm.

840
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,015
That's true.

841
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,768
Alex is trying his last effort

842
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,061
to make a pitch to stay on

843
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,062
longer, and he presented a

844
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,439
strong case.

845
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,941
His argument was that Yau-Man

846
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,776
has the idol, and he's going to

847
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:02,944
take Boo and Stacy with him

848
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:03,945
because he knows, their

849
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,114
personalities, people are not

850
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,365
going to vote for them to get

851
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,575
the million dollars.

852
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,409
It all started to make a little

853
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:09,617
sense.

854
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,452
I felt like, you know, Yau-Man

855
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,745
is going to eventually have to

856
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,706
leave, so why not tonight?

857
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,541
Maybe I'll be able to convince

858
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:20,086
other people of that.

859
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,283
>> I get nervous when I'm

860
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,618
alone, you know.

861
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,454
They're all talking about me.

862
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,247
>> I don't think so.

863
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,967
>> I anticipated this.

864
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,552
So Alex is just trying to save

865
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,762
his neck and say, "You guys

866
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,846
should use my vote.

867
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,056
This is your only chance to

868
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:13,973
take Yau-Man out."

869
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,308
But you know what?

870
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,684
I'd rather just vote your ass

871
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,020
off now, and I'll risk it.

872
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,902
>> Alex was talking to Cassandra

873
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:26,986
and Dreamz, and they seemed

874
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,321
like they were listening, but

875
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,572
they weren't.

876
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,198
I kind of like winked at them a

877
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,115
couple of times.

878
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,409
You know, you just play along

879
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,202
with him.

880
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,036
I don't think they're taking it

881
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,498
serious.

882
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,167
>> You really buying this?

883
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,127
>> I'm buying it, but I'm

884
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,629
like, then where does Alex fit

885
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,463
in everywhere?

886
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,005
>> He don't.

887
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:46,547
That's the whole thing, he's

888
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,966
gonna... after me, you and Earl,

889
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,718
the whole plan, regardless of

890
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,053
what happens, it's me, you and

891
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,554
Earl getting to the top three.

892
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,186
>> You know, Dreamz, like I told

893
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,145
you from day one...

894
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:01,729
>> I really want to do that

895
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,563
tonight.

896
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,856
The plan was to get rid of Alex

897
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,108
tonight, but Alex is my friend,

898
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,193
and Yau-Man has the immunity

899
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,236
idol, and that makes him so

900
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,070
dangerous.

901
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,322
Yau-Man has already said that I

902
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,741
was a big threat, so if he could

903
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,826
put that immunity idol into

904
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,451
play, that means he goes to try

905
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:21,916
to get rid of me.

906
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:22,875
>> You're down with that?

907
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,751
>> Yup.

908
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,377
>> Cassandra, what do you want

909
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,585
to do?

910
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,211
>> I'm down with you, Dreamz.

911
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,254
I told you from day one...

912
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,214
I told you from day one...

913
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,507
>> And I'm like a freakin'

914
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,133
follower.

915
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,135
I follow Cassandra.

916
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,178
>> If Cassandra's down with

917
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,805
this, it's gonna definitely go

918
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,681
through.

919
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,724
>> It's pretty safe to say if I

920
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,975
vote Yau-Man out, Stacy and

921
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,184
Dreamz will more than likely

922
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,310
vote with me.

923
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,271
And so, um, I definitely have a

924
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,188
choice to make, either to vote

925
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,691
Alex or Yau-Man.

926
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,275
And at this point right now,

927
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,234
I'm very undecided.

928
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,194
I'm not sure what I'm going to

929
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,947
do tonight.

930
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,790
>> I'm writing down A-L-E-X.

931
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,917
>> Mm-hmm.

932
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,211
I think Earl is very close

933
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,129
to Yau-Man.

934
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,839
There's no way he'd go for it.

935
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,340
So in order to blindside

936
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,675
Yau-Man, we definitely feel like

937
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,301
we have to blindside Earl at the

938
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,220
same time.

939
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,305
And so um, my head is telling me

940
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,807
one thing, and my heart is

941
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,350
saying another thing.

942
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,227
So I'm hoping that by the time

943
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,853
it's time for Tribal Council,

944
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,648
I'll have a clear feeling

945
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,066
exactly who I'm going to vote

946
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,735
for.

947
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,591
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

948
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,218
the jury.

949
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:42,265
Rocky, Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo,

950
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,143
and Mookie, voted out at the

951
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,228
last Tribal Council.

952
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,526
Alex, last Tribal Council, it

953
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,361
was you or Mookie.

954
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,487
>> Right.

955
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,989
>> PROBST: Mookie's over there.

956
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:58,739
>> I'm definitely feeling the

957
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,532
heat, Jeff.

958
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,449
But I told these guys, if I'm

959
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,242
going to be in this, you know

960
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,243
me, I'm going to fight to the

961
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,327
very end.

962
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,412
And for people who are sitting

963
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,496
here you have to consider who

964
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,205
you really want next to you.

965
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,457
And, you know, people forget

966
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,792
alliances.

967
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,835
Things are going to get very,

968
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,003
very messy from this point

969
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,296
forward whether I'm here or not.

970
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,381
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, if something

971
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,549
dramatic was going to happen,

972
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,717
tonight's a good name night for

973
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,384
it.

974
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,802
You got six people.

975
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,095
Suddenly Alex becomes very

976
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:21,429
valuable.

977
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,890
Does that concern you?

978
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,099
>> I've thought about that

979
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:25,641
scenario, but because I have

980
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,560
been with my alliance for so

981
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,270
long, I have decided that I can

982
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,897
actually trust them up to this

983
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,064
point.

984
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,608
I can see maybe turning one,

985
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,817
possibly two, but to be able to

986
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,319
turn three over, that's a very

987
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,404
remote possibility at this time.

988
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,614
I may be wrong, but I hope I'm

989
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,824
not.

990
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,658
>> PROBST: Dreamz, do you

991
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,535
believe that these six are as

992
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,162
tight as they say?

993
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:46,787
It's Alex tonight, that's it,

994
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,331
and then tomorrow we deal with

995
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,124
the six?

996
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:50,917
>> It's definitely a

997
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,500
possibility that he can swing

998
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,251
three people, you know what I

999
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,836
mean.

1000
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,503
It's not totally out of the

1001
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,671
question.

1002
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,006
>> PROBST: Alex, you obviously

1003
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:57,965
had to try to do something

1004
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:58,841
today.

1005
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,217
Do you lie down and die or do

1006
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,345
you start looking for cracks?

1007
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,596
>> I guess we'll find out

1008
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,681
tonight, Jeff.

1009
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,726
>> PROBST: Let's talk about the

1010
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,936
hidden immunity idol.

1011
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,270
Yau-Man, in some ways it

1012
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,064
represents safety.

1013
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,148
In other ways, you could be a

1014
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,483
target simply because you have

1015
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,193
it.

1016
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,235
>> I don't feel the pressure

1017
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,862
today, but the next round, I

1018
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,488
think I will feel the pressure

1019
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,865
when the six original alliance

1020
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,075
members are going to look

1021
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:24,659
around for somebody to vote

1022
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,369
out, they may decide to flush

1023
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,496
the idol out so that I cannot

1024
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,248
use it for some nefarious

1025
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,583
purpose, so at that point I

1026
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,542
will have to really keep

1027
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,669
my ears close to the ground and

1028
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,336
see what's going on.

1029
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,213
>> PROBST: Alex, what kind of

1030
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,631
chatter has there been about

1031
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,508
the other hidden immunity idol?

1032
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,219
>> With one immunity idol out

1033
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,303
and another one possibly on its

1034
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,471
way, I mean, that's got to weigh

1035
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,014
in on people's minds.

1036
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,724
You can only use them tonight,

1037
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,934
the next Tribal Council and

1038
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:50,559
the one after that.

1039
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,310
That's three opportunities, two

1040
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,270
idols.

1041
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,355
You do the math on that.

1042
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,356
If it doesn't go down tonight,

1043
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,399
it's going down in the next

1044
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:56,941
couple of Tribal Councils.

1045
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,734
So now or never.

1046
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,735
Maybe the next time might be now

1047
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,653
or never.

1048
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,737
You just never know.

1049
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,655
>> PROBST: Are you surprised

1050
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,281
how unconcerned these six seem

1051
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:04,490
to be?

1052
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,784
>> I'm very surprised by it.

1053
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,451
I mean either they are

1054
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,329
completely 100% trustworthy or

1055
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,539
they haven't seen enough of this

1056
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:11,706
game.

1057
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,457
I mean, if it really comes down

1058
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,792
to them six after this, they

1059
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,751
have to think people are

1060
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,752
thinking more than one

1061
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,503
move ahead.

1062
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,421
It's very plausible.

1063
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,630
There are only a few days left.

1064
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,339
You got to think ahead, I think,

1065
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,217
at this point.

1066
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,926
>> PROBST: Before we get to the

1067
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,803
vote, one quick question: yes

1068
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,430
or no answer, Alex, legitimately

1069
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,681
concerned tonight?

1070
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:28,889
>> Yes.

1071
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,558
>> PROBST: Cassandra?

1072
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,892
>> No.

1073
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,977
>> PROBST: Dreamz?

1074
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,311
>> I don't think so, Jeff, not

1075
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:34,478
now.

1076
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,272
>> PROBST: Stacy, legitimately

1077
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,064
concerned?

1078
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:37,648
>> No.

1079
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,733
>> PROBST: Yau-Man?

1080
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,817
>> No.

1081
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,194
>> PROBST: Earl?

1082
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:42,570
>> No.

1083
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,363
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1084
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,198
to the vote.

1085
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:46,782
If somebody does have a hidden

1086
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,576
immunity idol and you want to

1087
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,869
play it, you would present it to

1088
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,829
me before I read the votes.

1089
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:52,788
Boo, you have individual

1090
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,581
immunity.

1091
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,123
Are you going to hang on to

1092
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:54,874
that?

1093
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,125
>> Yes, I will, Jeff.

1094
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,168
>> PROBST: Cannot vote for Boo.

1095
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,377
Everybody else is fair game.

1096
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,380
Alex, you're up.

1097
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,015
>> Nothing personal, Yau-Man.

1098
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:11,599
Just trying to stay in this as

1099
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,601
long as I can.

1100
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,613
>> Good-bye.

1101
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,990
It's finally time for you to go.

1102
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,767
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1103
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,852
votes.

1104
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,112
If anybody has a hidden

1105
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:06,695
immunity idol and you want to

1106
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,781
play it, now is the time to do

1107
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,866
so.

1108
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,250
Okay, once the votes are read,

1109
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,334
the decision is final.

1110
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,252
The person voted out will be

1111
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,253
asked to leave the Tribal

1112
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,546
Council area immediately.

1113
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,631
I'll read the votes.

1114
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,428
First vote: Alex.

1115
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,974
Yau-Man.

1116
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,059
One vote Yau-Man.

1117
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,520
Alex.

1118
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,688
Two votes Alex,

1119
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,773
one vote Yau-Man.

1120
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,485
Alex.

1121
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,611
That's three votes Alex,

1122
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,697
one vote Yau-Man.

1123
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,952
12th person voted out and the

1124
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,454
sixth member of our jury: Alex.

1125
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,166
You need to bring me your torch.

1126
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:08,382
Alex, the tribe has spoken.

1127
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,634
Time for you to go.

1128
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,524
Well, based on what I heard

1129
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,567
tonight, I'd suggest you head

1130
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,986
back to camp, start sharpening

1131
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,237
those knives.

1132
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,280
Grab your torches,

1133
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,323
head back to camp.

1134
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,782
Good night.

1135
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:47,755
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1136
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,257
from our next episode.

1137
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,177
>> PROBST: Next time on

1138
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,719
<i>Survivor:</i>

1139
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,804
Yau-Man's in trouble.

1140
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,187
And the competition reaches a

1141
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,272
whole new level.

1142
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,317
>> PROBST: you're willing to

1143
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,318
take that risk?

1144
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,403
>> Yes.

1145
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,701
>> I know that I played this

1146
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,328
game to the best of my ability.

1147
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,455
I gave it 110% every single day

1148
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:22,498
I was out here.

1149
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,123
For all the kids who feel like

1150
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,750
their situation is hopeless,

1151
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,834
just remember to never stop

1152
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,461
dreaming, never stop fighting.

1153
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:29,088
You can and will amaze yourself.

1154
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,047
I think the six remaining

1155
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,090
members are living in a dream

1156
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,299
world if they think that they're

1157
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,092
not going to have to backstab

1158
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:33,384
each other.

1159
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,510
I mean things are going to get

1160
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,553
very ugly at this point.
