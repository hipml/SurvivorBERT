00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,464
<i>Chuay Gahn speculated</i>
<i>about a possible merge.</i>

TED:
I have a feeling it's going

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,550
to happen
in the next three days.

5
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,802
It could,
I wouldn't be surprised.

6
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,345
PROBST:<i> Robb was upset</i>

7

8

PENNY:
<i>I said absolutely not, 100%</i>

9
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,144
never was I going to write
your name down last night.

10
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,771
PROBST:<i> Believing Penny,</i>
<i>Robb confronted Ken.</i>

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,897
Trust is instilled early.

12
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,649
I'm the only person
that's been straight with you

13
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,610
and you just bit the ... hand
that's been trying to feed you.

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,237
PROBST:<i> Robb's mood</i>
<i>didn't get any better</i>

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,655
<i>when the tribe objected</i>

<i>to his helping himself</i>
<i>to their bananas.</i>

17
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,908
I'm not trying to squabble
about bananas.

18
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,994
-We're just trying to...
-All right, well, then, shut up.

19
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,663
PROBST:<i> When Shii Ann tried to</i>
<i>intervene, Penny got annoyed.</i>

20
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,623
PENNY:<i> I said,</i>
<i>"Shii Ann, stay out of it.</i>

24

We were fighting over bananas.

<i>But it was Chuay Gahn that won</i>

29
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,598
<i>the all-important immunity,</i>

30
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,768
<i>sending Sook Jai</i>

-You guys are all with me.
-(Ken murmurs indistinctly)

33
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,317
The tribe has spoken.

34
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,902
Thanks, bro.

PROBST:
<i>Ten are left.</i>

ERIN:
<i>This is, by far,</i>

38
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,477
<i>one of the hardest things</i>
<i>I've ever done.</i>

39
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,521
<i>You've made bonds</i>
<i>with these people</i>

40
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,648
<i>and you do feel bad</i>
<i>when you have to vote them out,</i>

41
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,733
<i>because they are your family</i>
<i>for right now.</i>

42
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,361
Who feels good about that one?

43
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,445
And you know what?

44
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,740
It's going to get
harder and harder.

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,743
ERIN:<i> But I don't necessarily</i>
<i>feel completely,</i>

46
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,913
uh, confident with
any single person in the tribe.

47
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,416
I don't get it
with him and Shii Ann.

48
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,626
I don't either.

49
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,587
They may already have
an alliance already.

50
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,130
Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,506
ERIN:<i> So I am kind of maybe</i>
<i>keeping an eye on Ken</i>

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,426
<i>and keeping an eye on Shii Ann.</i>

53
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,428
I think those two are
probably th-th-the two

54
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,765
that I might keep my eye on
the most at this point.

55
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,225
KEN: I told Robb
the truth from square one...

56
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,435
-SHII ANN: Yeah. -...about
everything he ever asked me.

57
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,562
That day,
remember when he, like,

58
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,563
started fighting with me?

59
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,731
Yeah.

60
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,400
That day Penny told him
that I was lying to him.

61
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,278
Just 'cause she said it,
he-he got all pissy,

62
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,946
and he started fighting with me.

63
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,616
SHII ANN: I think it's really,
like, kind of messed up

64
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,825
that Penny keeps doing that.

65
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,160
KEN:
Yeah, well, look,

66
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:22,702
she's playing the game, too.

67
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,454
She's playing hard.

68
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,830
She's playing hardball, dude.

69
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,957
She... but she,
yeah, she's playing like, uh...

70
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,417
-Hardball, seriously.
-She's playing like sneaky.

71
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,252
She's so sneaky about it.

72
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,838
KEN:<i> I'm watching Penny</i>
<i>because she's sneaky.</i>

73
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,840
I know her MO,
her method of operation.

74
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,592
I can see it.
It's all over her.

75
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,302
I can just picture her
in high school.

76
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,763
I know how she was
when she was in high school.

77
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,681
<i>I see how she operates.</i>

78
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,309
I think she wants
to vote me out right now. Oh.

79
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,811
She's been... She's been
after you all... since day one.

80
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,021
Oh, she's been after me forever.

81
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,815
SHII ANN:<i> Ken was pretty upset</i>
<i>about Penny's</i>

82
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,317
manipulative ways,
even though he knows

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,194
that that's the way she is.

84
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,820
<i>He doesn't like it</i>
<i>when the table turned.</i>

85
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,822
<i>Going into a merge,</i>
<i>he's strong,</i>

86
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,366
<i>he's going</i>
<i>to be a huge target.</i>

87
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,117
All right, dude,
I'm going to bed.

88
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:03,618
All right, good night.

89
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,828
Good night, baby.

90
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,163
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

91
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:08,456
I'll see you tomorrow.

92
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,640
JAKE:
Treemail, guys! Treemail!

93
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,016
Let me read this.

94
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,018
"A different color per person,

95
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,645
"adorn yourselves well.

96
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,815
"Show some personality,
'cause you can never tell.

97
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,482
"Use only one color.

98
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,026
"Don't share with a friend.

99
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,569
"Take pride in your artistry.

100
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,446
It will pay off in the end."

101
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,198
And let's see what these are.

102
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,200
-Looks like little... probably
little finger paints. -Ooh.

103
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,202
KEN: You got blue,
I'll take blue.

104
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,496
SHII ANN:<i> We got treemail</i>
<i>with paints, and we were told</i>

105
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,539
<i>to pick a color and to start</i>
<i>painting ourselves.</i>

106
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,541
<i>And we didn't really know</i>

107
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,042
what it was for; we figured

108
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,919
it had something
to do with a merge,

109
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,378
but we didn't really know.

110
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,339
Body paint, huh?

Hey, it's body paint stuff!

112
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,592

-HELEN: That's a pretty color.

115
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,180
-That's gonna look good.
-Here we go.

00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,390
-Well, let's go.
-This looks good.

117
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,474
-Ooh. -Come on,
let's all show some personality.

118
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,087
PROBST:
Welcome.

119
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,383
Congratulations on making it
to day 19, a physical

120
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,594
and political feat that six
of your other tribe mates

121
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,929
were unable to accomplish.

122
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,723
We thought it might be fun
this morning

123
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,224
to give you guys a chance

124
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,769
to get to know someone
from the other tribe;

125
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,438
spend a little quality time,
one-on-one.

126
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,565
Five different colored paints
were sent over to each beach.

127
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,778
You guys each
randomly selected one,

128
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,405
and in doing so, you matched
yourselves up with somebody

129
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,115
from the other tribe.

130
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,784
As I call out the pairs,
I want you two

131
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,788
to meet in the middle
and randomly select one basket.

132
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,624
Two of these baskets contain
further instructions.

133
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,418
And then find a nice, quiet,

134
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,503
secluded spot on the beach,

135
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,587
and start getting
to know each other.

136
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,547
-All right.
-All right.

137
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,924
Let's start with you guys.

138
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,133
JAN:
<i>And so, Jeff</i>

139
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,426
called out the color,

140
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,928
and the people got
with the person

141
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,346
that had the same body paint.

142
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,891
<i>So, Clay and Shii Ann</i>
<i>got the same.</i>

143
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,019
<i>Penny and Brian ended up</i>
<i>with the same color.</i>

144
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,939
<i>Erin and Teddy</i>
<i>got the same color.</i>

145
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:42,318
<i>Helen and Ken ended up</i>
<i>the same color.</i>

146
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:42,860
<i>And,</i>

147
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,529
as luck would have it,

148
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,822
Jake and I ended up
the same thing,

149
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,658
<i>so that was real funny, 'cause</i>
<i>we were the original</i>

150
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,328
<i>ones to have picked the tribes.</i>

151
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,663
Let's go!

152
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,164
-Have fun, guys.
-JAN: We will, thanks.

153
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:55,957
Here we go.

154
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,167
Even holding hands.
I like it.

155
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,670
JAN:
Absolutely!

156
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,713
BRIAN: You want to see
what's in our, uh, basket?

157
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,631
PENNY:
Are we allowed to open it up?

158
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,633
I think so.

159
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,677
-Oh, wow!
-(Brian mutters)

160
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,303
We got some fruit.

161
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,222
BRIAN:
<i>We had a picnic on the beach,</i>

162
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,307
found out a little about each
other, found out a little bit

163
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,684
about the tribe, found out
how they were living.

164
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,686
We did a lot of oysters
and snails in the beginning.

165
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,604
Isn't it a pain to clean them
and do all that stuff?

166
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,523
Uh-huh. Boil 'em and...

167
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,400
Oh, what's in our basket?

168
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,860
I don't know.

169
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,653
-Oh, wow!
-Wow.

170
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,530
-Hey! What's this?

171

my camp, and the other couple

You got a home in the cave?

That's so wonderful!

The bats in there

185
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:54,891
fly off
in the early afternoon.

186
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,934
That's nice. We had...

187
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,103
-We had a rooster waking us up
for a while. -Really?

188
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,521
SHII ANN:
But we ate him.

everywhere. -Oh, you do?

-No.

we named our monkey.

Wow. This is great!

our shelter, I think. -Really?

-Yeah.

-Yes, we did.

199

-Yeah.

HELEN:<i> My first impression</i>
<i>of Sook Jai was,</i>

204
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,761
I was incredibly struck
with how

205
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,013
<i>well they had built</i>
<i>their structure.</i>

206
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,556
-Cheers.
-Yeah. Cheers.

207
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,642
HELEN:<i> And then the second</i>
<i>thing, of course, was:</i>

208
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,644
"Where's your water hole?"
"Oh, it's around the corner."

209
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,937
I'm, like, "It's what?"

210
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,855
There it is.

211
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,815
How about you guys?
How is it set up over there?

212
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,443
Same type of water hole,
but like I said,

213
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,237
you got to swim
at least a mile to it.

214
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,446
Oh, my goodness.

215
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,781
Yeah.

216
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,657
KEN:
<i>I was one of the ambassadors</i>

217
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,285
who took Helen back
to Sook Jai camp,

218
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,620
and, um, I just... I listened.

219
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,914
<i>I didn't tell her much.</i>

220
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,123
<i>I just listened, because--</i>

221
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,792
<i>let's face it--</i>
<i>this is my enemy.</i>

222
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,293
So, as far as,
like, your tribe...

223
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,753
How is... How is
your tribe together?

224
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,339
Like, do they... does everybody
like each other, or no, or...?

225
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,799
Um, yeah, I think so,

226
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,926
as much as you can like,
you know, strangers.

227
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,178
HELEN:<i> I am a suspicious</i>
<i>New Englander,</i>

228
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,972
<i>and he's a New York cop.</i>

229
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,975
<i>And I didn't want to be the one</i>
<i>that gave up all our secrets</i>

230
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,395
to the cop to take back
to spread around to Sook Jai.

231
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,940
SHII ANN: Well, you know what?
In our tribe,

232
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,984
we haven't gotten along
since day one. I...

233
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,652
-That's amazing.
-I'll tell you what.

234
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,112
I'll tell you the truth here.

235
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,322
SHII ANN:<i> At first, my strategy</i>
<i>was going to be just</i>

236
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,658
<i>let him talk, get the scoop</i>
<i>on Chuay Gahn.</i>

237
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,620
But as soon as I got
to Chuay Gahn, it was, like...

238
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,291
I don't know, it was, like,
because I had been so pent up

239
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,334
for 18 days,
I just spilled my guts.

240
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,669
I'll tell you right now,
what they're saying,

241
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,506
and this is what
we-we've all said back home is,

242
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,508
we keep our five,
and start voting out you guys.

243
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,718
Uh-huh.

244
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,677
<i>I learned some stuff</i>
<i>from Shii Ann that, uh...</i>

245
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,179
Some things that going on
in their camp,

246
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,514
and, uh, the way some
of the personalities

247
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:02,018
<i>have clashed and all the</i>
<i>problems they had over there.</i>

248
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,353
SHII ANN: And if Ken wasn't
around, I wouldn't be here.

249
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,064
Ken is the person who was like,
"You know what? That's not fair.

250
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,816
Why are you booting her out?
She works hard."

251
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,736
And Penny, who, by the way,
as sweet as she looks, she is...

252
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,404
Is she as sweet as she looks?

253
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:17,158
I'll tell you, she is the most
manipulative player on our team.

254
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,494
<i>So I gave him the down-low on</i>
<i>what was going on at Sook Jai</i>

255
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,580
<i>and all the crap</i>
<i>that I had to endure,</i>

256
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,708
and... and, uh, I found him
to be very sympathetic.

257
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,834
CLAY:
Well, we've already said that if

258
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,712
we could get Jake
on the older side,

259
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,005
and get one more person
that he likes...

260
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,048
SHII ANN:
Me.

261
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,674
...we could go...
we could go all the way,

262
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:33,924
and then, the best man wins.

263
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,801
Hmm.

264
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,519
All right!

265
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,271
So, uh, tell me how it went.

266
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,732
JAKE: Oh, man, we've been having
a great time.

267
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,775
-PROBST: Yeah?
-Just visiting about everything.

268
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,235
Learning about all
the other people in the tribes,

269
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,071
and just having a great time.

270
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,906
Well, you four had a little
different experience.

271
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,908
Shii Ann, tell me what you saw.

272
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,787
Um, I got to go to Chuay Gahn,
and I was so lucky,

273
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,456
you guys, who have not been
to Chuay Gahn.

274
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,916
It is a beautiful place.

275
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,584
They have a cove.

276
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,211
There's a... There's a cave.

277
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,587
They sleep under this cave.

278
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,714
-And there's no rain.
-(laughter)

279
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,340
It was just beautiful.

280
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,634
It was just... It's great.

281
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,427
-It was a wonderful
experience. -PROBST: Helen,

282
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,762
tell me about, uh,
your tour with Ken.

283
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,265
HELEN: Uh, I got to go over
to, uh, Sook Jai.

284
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,102
Yeah, they don't have a cave, so
they don't have any dry shelves

285
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:26,769
to put their clothes
and stuff, so...

286
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,813
TED:
I heard.

287
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,398
Well, when the four of you
grabbed your baskets

288
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,985
randomly, you sort of became
official ambassadors

289
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,946
for your tribes,
because today something

290
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,407
very different is happening.

291
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,034
The two tribes will now
live together on one beach.

292
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,621
The four of you will decide
for both tribes

293
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,872
which beach you'll move to.

294
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,791
Whichever beach you decide to
live on, you'll get a new boat

295
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,127
-for the last 21 days.
-All right!

296
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,461
So, the question is,

297
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,463
which beach are you going
to live on?

298
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,340
-Looks like we're going
to Chuay Gahn. -Chuay Gahn.

299
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,967
PROBST: Going to Chuay Gahn.
All right, for the members

300
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,593
of Sook Jai,
all your personal items

301
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,138
will be waiting for you
at your new beach.

302
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:02,972
For the members of Chuay Gahn,

303
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,975
it is also a new home
of sorts because

304
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,978
what was your beach is
now everybody's beach,

305
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,481
so in a sense,
you are essentially

306
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,983
starting over,
building a new world

307
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,651
with one big difference.

308
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,319
You now have 18 days
of education.

309
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,321
I think the only thing
left to do

310
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,990
is maybe, uh, exchange hellos
with everybody...

311
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,950
-Right.
-Yes.

312
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:23,951
...head to your new beach.

313
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,244

Say hi to our new family.

-Mm-hmm. -It's just
that people don't understand.

416

what Martin Luther King said:

417

"Judge a person by the content
of their character,

418
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,397
-That's right. -"...not by
the color of their skin."

419
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,065
It's not the race thing.

420
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,234
-It's the fact that I grew up
partly in Asia. -Yeah?

421
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,277
I'm eating chicken heart.
I'll eat the chicken neck.

to eat that?

423

-Fine, I'll eat it.
-Right, right, mm-hmm.

424
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,075
But you know, I can't stand
having people judge me,

425
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,077

I'm culturally different.

00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,577
-I'm all right. -CLAY: Brian's
out of it right now.

503
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,621
-BRIAN: Too much wine.
-Too much wine.

504
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,624
<i>So I had to get up with him</i>

505
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,460
and, you know, walk him out
to the beach, let him get air

506
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,421
<i>and stuff like that,</i>
<i>and kind of stayed with him,</i>

507
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,881
<i>to make sure he was all right.</i>

508
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,299
Now, you see why I don't drink?

509
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:39,303
<i>The situation just</i>
<i>basically reaffirmed</i>

510
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,387
our bond to each other.

511
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,473
Not only as alliance members,

512
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,516
<i>but as friends.</i>

513
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,309
That wine hit you, didn't it?

514
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,103
-Watch out for NYC.
-Hmm?

515
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,314
Watch out for NYC.
It's all a big game.

516
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,275
Ken's after me?

517
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,985
Yes. He's after blood.

518
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,112
<i>It was amazing that he</i>
<i>still had that strategy</i>

519
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,906
<i>in his mind,</i>
<i>even though he was drunk.</i>

520
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,242
-Keep a, uh, keep a lookout.
-Yeah.

521
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,578
<i>And we already have</i>
<i>a game plan in place.</i>

522
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,663
He has my back as much
as I have his back.

523
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,707
(retches)

524
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,502
(retches)

525
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,151
BRIAN:<i> Actually,</i>
<i>last night was quite eventful.</i>

526
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,153
<i>We had a little party</i>
<i>by the fire.</i>

527
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,322
<i>I think I had</i>
<i>a little too much wine.</i>

528
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,075
<i>So my night was</i>
<i>a little bit, uh, strange.</i>

529
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,204
<i>I think I was hurling.</i>

530
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,456
I was talking to my good friend,
Hurling Freddy.

531
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,209
So I happened to have
a little too much wine,

532
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,962
a little too many crackers,
but, uh, at the same time,

533
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,382
it shows everyone I'm human
and, uh, that I'm one of them.

534
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,510
TED:
Hey, B,

535
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,012
you want some wine?

536
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,806
I'll hook you up, I don't mind!

537
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,307
(Ted laughing)

538
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,893
I feel like J...
I feel like Jan.

539
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,479

540
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,399
<i>I've got a very subtle</i>
<i>form of leadership.</i>

541
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,359
<i>It's very low-key,</i>
<i>it's very understated.</i>

542
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,362
I know exactly what's going on.

543
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,990
For an hour or two,
I didn't... last night.

544
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,033
But most of the time I do.

545
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,495
<i>I know there's some cattiness</i>
<i>involved with the girls.</i>

546
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:32,708
<i>I know that maybe Shii Ann is</i>
<i>not too happy with her tribe.</i>

547
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,543
We'll see if I can use her
as part of my kingdom.

548
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,628
I'm not sure yet.

549
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,589
Just so you know,
it's going towards P.

550
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,549
-Oh, I... I know that.
-Just so you know.

551
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,676
I know that, but I'm...

552
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,677
Huge majority going that way.

553
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,471
SHII ANN:
<i>I had a very dramatic morning.</i>

554
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,516
<i>Chuay Gahn guys are asking me</i>
<i>if I'm on board with them to go</i>

555
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,852
<i>six against Penny,</i>
<i>vote her out.</i>

556
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,562
Ken woke up
and started asking me

557
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,231
what's going on with me,
if I was gonna switch

558
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,899
to the Chuay Gahn side.

559
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,693
<i>I just said, you know,</i>
<i>"I'm really confused."</i>

560
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,653
<i>And I am, and, you know,</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

561
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,072
-Do you hear what I'm saying?
-Yeah, I hear.

562
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,241
I got two people
who really trust me.

563
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:07,909
I'm about
to break their trust.

564
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,578
I know some of
your best instincts

565
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,079
are usually
the first instincts.

566
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,540
-My instinct is to go with P.
-Okay.

567
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,668
But... the thing is,
Ken makes good arguments.

568
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,587
-You got a new family.
-(quietly): I know.

569
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,630
Just remember that.

570
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,090
And you can feel it.

571
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,467
-I know.
-You can feel it.

572
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,594
-And Clay loves you,
Helen loves you, -I know.

573
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,262
Ted loves you, we all love you.

574
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,722
-Yeah.
-And we'll all have fun.

575
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,724
<i>I told Chuay Gahn that I'm...</i>

576
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,725
I'm on board.

577
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,728
I told them to their face
that I'm on board.

578
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,397
<i>I'm working a deal;</i>
<i>I'm voting Penny out.</i>

579
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,398
I mean, Shii Ann, Shii Ann...

580
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,399
Oh, I think
there's something on me.

581
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,609
...let's have fun;
this is gonna be a blast.

582
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,279
I know it's gonna be a blast.
I'm having a great time.

583
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,031
You know I'm having
a great time.

584
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,634
SHII ANN:
<i>I have not firmly said</i>

585
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,302
<i>that I was gonna</i>
<i>vote for Penny.</i>

586
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,512
<i>I've talked to Ken about it,</i>
<i>but I feel like</i>

587
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,348
it would be
the right thing to do,

588
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,599
to let them know that
I'm not voting with them.

589
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,851
But, at the same time,

590
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,313
<i>I'm not sure that</i>
<i>it would be wise to do that.</i>

591
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,357
Did you figure out
what you're gonna do?

592
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,401
Yeah, I think I'm
gonna go with my, uh...

593
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,988
...think I'm gonna go...

594
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,494
I'm very... I'm flip-flopping.

595
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,538
Well, I just need to know
what you're gonna do.

596
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,498
I mean, everybody said
you were gonna do this,

597
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,333
and I defended you,
saying you weren't.

598
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,543
And then you're doing it.

599
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,461
<i>I had a conversation</i>
<i>with Shii Ann.</i>

600
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,506
<i>I-I... hey, look,</i>
<i>if she does, like,</i>

601
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,674
turn on the whole
voting strategy,

602
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,553
for the rest of her life,
she'll be considered a rat.

603
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,514
I don't know what
I'm gonna do, exactly.

604
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,683
Like, can you
at least let me know

605
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,352
which way... if you're...
if you're going with their side

606
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,520
or staying on our side?

607
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,563
I'm staying on
you and Jake's side.

608
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,982
Well, that's
what I'm talking about.

609
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,525
But I'm not staying
on Penny and Erin's side.

610
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,652
Penny's the one that got to go.

611
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,528
I've talked about it
with Brian, too.

612
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,322
She's going-- just not yet.

613
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,325
Let us get an advantage first,
then we'll take out Penny.

614
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,660
We're gonna do that next.

615
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,204
<i>In fact, we're even-numbered</i>
<i>here, five and five.</i>

616
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,874
Now you're gonna give them
an advantage, thinking,

617
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,376
you know, because you're....
because you're like

618
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,920
a little snake, now they're
gonna, like, invite you in?

619
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,548
That shows disloyalty
from the beginning.

620
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,716
<i>She's making herself an outcast</i>
<i>on both sides, at this point.</i>

621
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,926
I know
you're pissed off at Penny

622
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,844
and you want to get rid of her

623
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,388
and you don't want her
to make the jury,

624
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,723
but don't sink
everybody else and yourself,

625
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,559
because you're pissed off
at one person.

626
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,227
And that's what you're doing.

627
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,606
So just think about it
and let me know what's going on.

628
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,526
SHII ANN:
<i>I don't think</i>

629
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,236
<i>I'm gonna discuss this</i>
<i>with Ken anymore.</i>

630
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,406
Right now he's really doing
his interrogation routine,

631
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,783
his... I mean,
the policeman is coming out,

632
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:58,246
and he's-he's...
really, in a way,

633
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,748
trying to intimidate me,

634
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,791
<i>and at this point,</i>
<i>I'm willing to gamble</i>

635
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,835
<i>on voting out Penny and Erin,</i>

636
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,255
<i>and just seeing what happens</i>
<i>with the Chuay Gahn tribe.</i>

00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,438
SHII ANN: So, I think we're
gonna get some treemail today.

639
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,898
TED:
Do you think so?

640
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,691
-Come on, y'all.
-SHII ANN: We got some mail!

641
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,068

-And it came

00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,611
-with this weird lock.
-We didn't read it yet.

00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,905

Yay! Come on!

644
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,822
-SHII ANN: Here you go.
-Listen.

645
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,325

00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,491
The ten of you are meeting for
the first time, in many cases.

667
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,869
Erin, was it tough
having two tribes

668
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,370
live together on the same beach?

669
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,205
To be completely honest,
no, not at all.

670
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,207
It's actually much better having
both tribes live together.

671
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,002
I never would have
expected our merge

672
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,546
to have gone
as smoothly as it has.

673
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,173
-You said merge.
-Yes.

674
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,174
I certainly didn't say anything

675
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,550
to give you that
impression, did I?

676
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,639
What I said to you guys
when you left is,

677
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,058
"something very different's
about to happen.

678
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,852
Two tribes will live together
on the same beach."

679
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,355
That's exactly
what you're doing.

680
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,856
You are two tribes

681
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,941
-living on the same beach.
-TED: I assumed--

682
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,986
and it's always dangerous
to assume--

683
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,573
that we were one tribe now,
and this would be

684
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,407
more of an individual effort.

685
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,784
PROBST:
But in terms of the game,

686
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,078
just to make sure
you understand,

687
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:43,787
it's very clearly still

688
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,206
Sook Jai with five members,

689
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,582
Chuay Gahn with five members.

690
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,584
The two tribes never merged.

691
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,380
Okay, let's get
to today's challenge.

692
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,925
As you guys know, Tarutao Island
used to be a prison.

693
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,927
Escapes, attempted escapes
happened often.

694
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,887
That's what you guys
are gonna do today,

695
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,806
is attempt to escape

696
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,099
<i>from a makeshift prison.</i>

697
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,517
<i>Here's how it'll work.</i>

698
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,935
Each tribe member will be
chained and shackled.

699
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,814
Now, these locks
open with a key--

700
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,108
two on the wrist,
one on the ankle.

701
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,235
That's three locks
for each person.

702
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,278
Five tribe members,
that's 15 locks.

703
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,114
The keys to your locks

704
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,116
<i>are located outside</i>
<i>of the jail on posts.</i>

705
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,787
<i>Your goal: using materials</i>
<i>found within the jail cell,</i>

706
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,123
<i>create a way to reach out</i>
<i>and retrieve your keys.</i>

707
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,708
<i>You got to keep at least</i>
<i>one foot on the ground</i>

708
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,793
<i>inside your cell.</i>

709
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,961
You can only grab
one key at a time,

710
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,464
and the key can
only be used on one lock.

711
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,133
You cannot use a key
more than once.

712
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,969
Once all five tribe members
have released

713
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,762
<i>all 15 of their locks,</i>

714
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,972
<i>you must then dig</i>
<i>your way out of the jail.</i>

715
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,974
You got to crawl under,

716
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,475
<i>out the front.</i>

717
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,769
First tribe to get
out of that jail,

718
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:53,273
<i>cross the finish line with</i>
<i>all 15 keys in possession,</i>

719
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,858
-wins immunity.
-Whew! -Wow!

720
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,984
Losers, Tribal Council,

721
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,821
where another member of your
tribe will be voted out.

722
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,197
-Shall we get it on?
-Let's do it.

723
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,282
Let's do it.

724
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,042
PROBST:
Here we go, guys.

725
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:13,960
Immunity at stake.

726
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,129
Survivors ready!

727
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,132
Go!

728
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,302
Remember, anything
you can find on the floor

729
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,721
is okay to use.

730
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,222
Got a little rain coming in.

731
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,267
(rain falling)

732
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,979
Faster you get out,
the faster you get dry.

733
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,905
Brian's got his first key.

734
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,907
Brian has his first key
for Chuay Gahn.

735
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,034
Ken's getting closer.

736
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:50,497
Ken making a play for a key.

737
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,123
Inches short.

738
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,878
Big Ted with two keys
for Chuay Gahn.

739
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:01,132
Remember, guys,
one key per lock.

740
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,637
Shii Ann leaning out.

741
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:10,558
Shii Ann with
the first key for Sook Jai.

742
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:13,978
TED:
Hold on, hold on, Brian.

743
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,901
PROBST: Shii Ann and Ken
with keys for Sook Jai.

744
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,864
Brian with another key
for Chuay Gahn.

745
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,076
Ken with another key
for Sook Jai.

746
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,037
Brian trying to make something
happen for Chuay Gahn.

747
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,375
Brian with another key
for Chuay Gahn.

748
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,589
Ken with another key
for Sook Jai.

749
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,925
There you go, baby girl,
you're out of jail.

750
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,427
JAN:
You're out.

751
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:51,266
JAKE: Get your shoestrings,
guys-- shoestrings really help.

752
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,393
PROBST:
Ingenuity at work.

753
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,943
Brian lost his key.

754
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,991
Both tribes have
grabbed a key and lost it.

755
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:11,160
Chuay Gahn has two left.

756
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,289
Sook Jai still needs three.

757
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,915
Nice job.

758
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,625
Chuay Gahn grabs another key.

759
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,835
Down to their last one.

760
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,298
Make sure if you're leaning out
of the cage, that one foot

761
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,301
is on the ground in the jail.

762
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,219
Sook Jai gets
another key inside.

763
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,680
Two more to go.

764
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,141
Shii Ann gets another one.

765
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,185
Both tribes down
to their last keys.

766
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,274
BRIAN: Wait, wait,
wait, wait-- we're breaking,

767
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,692
we're breaking, we're breaking,
we're breaking.

768
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,485
We're going too quick.
We're going too quick.

769
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,988
PROBST: Chuay Gahn's
last key on the ground.

770
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,032
BRIAN:
Guys...

771
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,661
PROBST: Nice work.
Sook Jai has the last key

772
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,204
off their post.

773
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,006
Chuay Gahn has
their last key inside.

774
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,008
Once the lock is off,
you can start digging.

775
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,886
Wait till the lock is off.

776
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,888
-Go, go, go!
-Start digging!

777
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,139
Chuay Gahn,

778
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,099
you're gonna have to dig
a pretty big hole for Big Ted.

779
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,851
(Jan speaks indistinctly)

780
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:19,646
PROBST:
You're still in this, Sook Jai.

781
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,105
Sook Jai still has
one key on the ground.

782
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,067
Helen's half out.

783
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,029
One member out for Chuay Gahn.

784
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,698
Sook Jai, don't quit.

785
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,742
Three members out
for Chuay Gahn.

786
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,246
Come on, Clay!

787
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,999
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!
-(Ted grunting)

788
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,042
(Ted continues grunting)

789
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,670
Let's go! Here we go!

790
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,880
PROBST:
Let me see those keys.

791
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,887
Fifteen.
Chuay Gahn wins immunity!

792
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,765
Yeah!

793
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,937
Chuay Gahn has immunity.

794
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,022
-Yay! -You guys are safe
three more days.

795
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,066
Sook Jai, nice effort, guys.

796
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,276
Unfortunately, not enough.

797
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,404
You know what this means--
Tribal Council.

798
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,072
Somebody's going home tonight.

799
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,199
You guys need to head
straight over there.

800
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,826
We'll see you there shortly.

801
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,143
CLAY:<i> I'm gonna tell y'all</i>
<i>what that was like.</i>

802
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,145
That was like going
to Thanksgiving dinner,

803
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,231
and somebody just slapped
the ... out of Grandma,

804
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,608
and both families split
and started fighting again.

805
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,111
JAN (laughs):
<i>Well, we had</i>

806
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,280
<i>another challenge,</i>
<i>but it was a trick.</i>

807
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:56,826
We thought it was
a merge of the two tribes.

808
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,120
And, of course, when we
got there, to our surprise,

809
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,581
it was not a merge,

810
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,291
<i>we are still two tribes,</i>

811
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,293
<i>vying for, uh, immunity.</i>

812
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,171
-They're gone. -Yeah, they're
at Tribal Council, y'all.

813
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,506
They're not getting a break.
They there.

814
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,382
TED:
After today...

815
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,260
-CLAY: Anything.
-...anything, I mean,

816
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,680
now we got a situation where
we're sleeping with the enemy.

817
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,324
PROBST:
Welcome to Tribal Council.

818
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,121
So, tonight, a very big vote.

819
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,332
If you survive tonight's vote,
you are in this game,

820
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,125
one way or another,
until the end,

821
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,711
because, at the very least,
you'll be a member of the jury

822
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,215
and have a big impact on who,
ultimately, wins this game.

823
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,800
All right, so,

824
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,302
you get to the beach,
everything's great.

825
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,721
You start assuming that we're
merging and that it's gonna be

826
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,847
an individual challenge.

827
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,557
You show up and you find out,

828
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,935
no, it's still tribal. Erin,

829
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,353
what's your reaction,
at that point,

830
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,355
as you're sitting there,
listening to me explain

831
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,315
that it's tribe versus tribe?

832
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,317
ERIN:
I was in complete shock,

833
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,029
because I thought
that we were gonna go to...

834
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:18,032
an immunity challenge
for individuals,

835
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:19,242
we were gonna get new buffs

836
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,577
and that we all had merged
into one tribe.

837
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,329
That's how we've been living
for the past couple days.

838
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,707
So I'm still in shock that
we're two separate tribes.

839
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,376
PROBST: Well, we're
getting a lot of weather,

840
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,503
the wind's blowing through here,
now the rain is

841
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,171
starting to come down outside.

842
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,423
Sort of a fitting end
to a turbulent three days.

843
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,718
(Shii Ann gasps)

844
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,053
Nice catch, Jake.

845
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,888
JAKE:
Thanks, I'd hate to lose this.

846
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,556
PROBST:
Jake,

847
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,059
how does this impact the game?

848
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,603
Clearly, you guys were working
toward the thought

849
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:52,441
that this would become a merge
and an individual game.

850
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,152
We're gonna be
down to four tonight,

851
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,236
and they're gonna be at five.

852
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,363
So what we're gonna have
to do now is just

853
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,907
reorganize our thoughts
and go back in

854
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,909
with some adaptable ideas,

855
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:02,326
and see where we're going.

856
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,287
Erin, you reckon

857
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,372
there's been some
information shared

858
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,166
in the last two and a half days

859
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,418
that people might be
regretting a little bit?

860
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,046
I feel that there may be a
little bit of information shared

861
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,589
in the past couple days.

862
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,591
I have already found out

863
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,927
that some people weren't
being true to our tribe,

864
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,429
and were kind of
trying to win over some

865
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,974
of the other Chuay Gahn members,
thinking it was a merge.

866
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,727
And it is, um...
kind of disheartening,

867
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,604
thinking that,
you know, your tribe,

868
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,771
that you thought you trusted,

869
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,273
now is starting
to really look out

870
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,443
for themselves rather
than for their entire tribe.

871
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,111
PROBST:
Penny, how do you

872
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:39,113
figure out how
you're gonna vote?

873
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,948
Because certainly there's
some strategy in this.

874
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,992
PENNY:
There is strategy in this,

875
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,119
but it's more so
kind of information

876
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,954
that was brought
to my attention,

877
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,789
saying that one
of my tribe members

878
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,584
has said that
I'm the next to go.

879
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,628
So, you talk about trust,

880
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,504
and I've had
to trust these people

881
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,631
for 18 days.

882
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,466
Well, the last 24 hours,
I'm thinking,

883
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,842
who can I<i> not</i> trust?

884
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,470
Well, guys, this is
always an open forum.

885
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,098
-Good. -You haven't had
a chance to talk until now,

886
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,517
but clearly, there's
stuff going on-- I can sense it,

887
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,436
-and I can see Shii Ann.
-I'd like... I'd love to speak.

888
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,479
Hey.

889
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,106
This is not a tribe unified.

890
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,733
It's never been a tribe unified.

891
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,985
As much as everyone here
would like to think

892
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,321
it was a tribe unified,
this has not been the case.

893
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,990
And I've been the brunt.

894
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,369
I've been the person who felt
that the most the entire time.

895
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,163
So is it surprising for me
to go to Chuay Gahn

896
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:31,499
and find five people
who are really lovely,

897
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,459
who I can talk to
for the first time

898
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:39,048
and realize that the people
who mistreated me at Sook Jai

899
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:43,302
are also the people who
Chuay Gahn distrusts the most.

900
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,012
You don't think they
asked about you, Ken?

901
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,264
You were the first person
they asked about.

902
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,183
And I watch your back.

903
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,559
Jake, same thing.

904
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:55,356
You know that I've
always been loyal to you.

905
00:37:55,439 --> 00:38:00,027
Penny, you're manipulative
because I know you don't...

906
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,071
I know that that's
not a pleasant word,

907
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,406
but it's the way that
you've played the game.

908
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,410
If we go back today and I'm out,
and not Penny,

909
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:11,372
that's gonna leave another
impression with those guys.

910
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,374
Penny, what's
your take on all this?

911
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,669
I've had plenty of opportunity
to vote Shii Ann out

912
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,546
if I wanted to,
and I chose not to.

913
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,716
'Cause I told her
that the five of us

914
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,050
should go in strong.

915
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,385
I don't feel like
I've been manipulative.

916
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,387
And, you know, bottom line is,

917
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,681
is we're still Sook Jai.

918
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,391
We are still Sook Jai.

919
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,518
No matter what Chuay Gahn
thinks or says,

920
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:36,272
these are the people
that I need to be with.

921
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,232
And these are the ones
that I'm concerned with.

922
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:39,233
I'm not concerned with them.

923
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,943
So, Shii Ann, what is
the plea you're making?

924
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,945
Are you making an offer?
Are you saying,

925
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:43,738
here's what we should do?

926
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,531
SHII ANN:
What I'm saying is,

927
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,117
Jake, Ken, Erin,

928
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,911
I know that you're thinking
about voting me off.

929
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,749
I mean honestly, today,
I didn't make any decisions.

930
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,376
I told you that I would
come up and tell you.

931
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,670
I have not lied to you yet.

932
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,256
I have not come up to you

933
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,549
and tried to backstab
someone else yet.

934
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,426
You got to look
at the whole 18 days.

935
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,263
You can't just look
at what happened today.

936
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,807
And I'm saying
don't vote me out,

937
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,603
because I've... promised
to be on your sides,

938
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,397
and I still maintain
that promise,

939
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,067
and when we go back to tribe,

940
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,610
if I'm with you guys,

941
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,612
I think I know more
intimately how...

942
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,281
where their heads are
than any of you,

943
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:29,075
and that's gonna come in handy.

944
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,451
PROBST:
Well, clearly, there is

945
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,661
a bit of a cloud hanging over
this tribe at the moment.

946
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,832
The big question now is:
How will that new information

947
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,292
impact tonight's vote?

948
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:41,128
It is time to find out,
because it's time to vote.

949
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:41,587
Shii Ann, you're first.

950
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,659
Tonight, I'm voting
for Shii Ann.

951
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,453
<i>It's obvious that</i>
<i>you broke alliances</i>

952
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:18,040
and all I have to say is,
what comes around goes around.

953
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:38,602
I'll go tally the votes.

954
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,531
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

955
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,532
Person voted out
will be asked to leave

956
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,659
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

957
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,537
I'll read the votes.

958
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,500
First vote...

959
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,835
Shii Ann.

960
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:05,629
Penny.

961
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,760
Shii Ann.

962
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,763
That's two votes Shii Ann,
one vote Penny.

963
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,560
Shii Ann.

964
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,604
You need to bring me your torch.

965
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,823
Shii Ann, the tribe has spoken.

966
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,035
Good luck, you guys.

967
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,661
PROBST:
It's time for you to go.

968
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,764
Well, there were a lot
of comments made tonight.

969
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,599
This tribe's either gonna
rebound and grow stronger

970
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,393
or fracture completely.

971
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,104
Something to think about
on a long, wet walk home.

972
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,065
You guys can head back to camp.

973
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:19,036
<i>Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

974
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,626
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor...

975
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,002
<i>The tribes adjust</i>
<i>to their new living situation.</i>

976
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,631
BRIAN:<i> You know we're living</i>
<i>together, it all looks peachy.</i>

977
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,632
It's us against them.

978
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,341
It smells like under

979
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,092
the boardwalk at Coney Island.

980
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,051
<i>I don't go around pissing</i>

981
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,844
<i>where I sleep,</i>
<i>like a Chuay Gahn.</i>

982
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:36,845
<i>Just for that simple fact,</i>

983
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,347
I can't feel at home here.

984
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:38,931
PROBST:
<i>And Magilla returns.</i>

985
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,933
The bananas are gone.

986
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,101
Damn monkey! I swear,

987
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,602
<i>I'm gonna kill him</i>
<i>if I get him.</i>

988
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,652
Well, I committed
the classic error

989
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,529
of plotting and scheming
too much.

990
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,782
(laughs)
<i>This has been a really, really</i>

991
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,826
<i>humbling experience for me,</i>

992
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,952
<i>and it's been really fun.</i>

993
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,996
<i>The last three days were really</i>

994
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,998
<i>some of</i>
<i>the best days of my life.</i>

995
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,000
<i>And good luck</i>
<i>to the rest of you</i>

996
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,626
<i>who are still in the game.</i>

997
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:07,751
No hard feelings.
