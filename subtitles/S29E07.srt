00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,835
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,796
"SURVIVOR": HUNAHPU WAS

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,088
STARVING.

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,548
>> WE'RE DOWN TO JUST, LIKE, A

5
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,383
HAND FULL OF RICE.

6
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,260
>> Jeff: AND DECIDED TO TRADE

7
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,178
NEARLY EVERYTHING FOR A BAG OF

8
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:12,387
RICE.

9
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,890
I WANT YOUR TARP, PILLOWES,

10
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,600
BLANKETS, YOU ARE STARTING OVER.

11
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,477
AND NO ONE FELT IT MORE THAN

12
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:19,686
JULIE.

13
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,937
>> I CAN'T DO THIS ALL NIGHT.

14
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,604
I CAN'T.

15
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,814
LAST NIGHT WAS THE HARDEST NIGHT

16
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,315
OF MY LIFE.

17
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:24,607
>> Reporter:

18
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,484
>> Jeff: BUT DESPITE LOSING

19
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,653
EVERYTHING-- DO THEY HAVE IT

20
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:28,862
RIGHT?

21
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:29,362
HUNAHPU WON THE IMMUNITY

22
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,739
CHALLENGE.

23
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,073
THEY DO.

24
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:32,574
HUNAHPU WINS ONCE AGAIN.

25
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,659
>> WE CAN'T CATCH A BREAK.

26
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,911
IT IS FRUSTRATING.

27
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,913
>> Jeff: BACK AT CAMP, DALE

28
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,999
WAS IN TROUBLE AND HOPED HIS

29
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:41,624
FAKE IMMUNITY IDOL COULD KEEP

30
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,918
HIM IN THE GAME.

31
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,253
>> IF I'M NOT VOTED OUT TONIGHT,

32
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,671
I'LL GIVE YOU MY IDOL.

33
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:46,921
>> DUDE.

34
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,173
>> RIGHT NOW I'M BARTERING THAT

35
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,008
IDOL FOR VOTES.

36
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:50,842
>> Jeff: WORRIED THAT THE IDOL

37
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,302
WAS REAL, THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE

38
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,888
DECIDED TO SPLIT THE VOTE

39
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,556
BETWEEN DALE AND THEIR ALLY,

40
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:56,765
KEITH.

41
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,809
>> THREE VOTES DALE TWO KEITH.

42
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,936
>> I'M SAD ABOUT THAT, BUT

43
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,896
BETTER KEITH THAN ME.

44
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,564
>> Jeff: AND AT TRIBAL

45
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,149
COUNCIL-- KEITH.

46
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,692
KEITH WAS SHOCKED TO GET VOTES.

47
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,277
BUT IN THE END, IT WAS DALE WHO

48
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,488
WAS SENT HOME.

49
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,155
DALE, YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR

50
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,198
TORCH.

51
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,618
DALE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

52
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,827
LEAVING KEITH CONFUSED AND IN

53
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,204
THE DARK.

54
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,580
12 ARE LEFT.

55
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:42,519
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

56
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,062
>> LAST NIGHT, WE VOTED DALE

57
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,980
OUT, BUT THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH

58
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,690
PARANOIA AND TALK OF HIM HAVING

59
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,568
AN IDOL, WE DECIDED BAYLOR AND I

60
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,903
WOULD WRITE KEITH, BUT I KNEW IT

61
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:52,904
WASN'T GOING TO SIT PRETTY.

62
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:53,780
NO ONE LIKES TO HAVE THEIR NAME

63
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,697
WRITTEN DOWN.

64
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,950
KEITH, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LAST

65
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:57,408
NIGHT.

66
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:57,992
I FEEL LIKE I KEPT SOMETHING

67
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,245
FROM YOU, AND IF YOU WERE IN THE

68
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,454
SAME POSITION AS ME AND YOU HAD

69
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,331
WES OVER HERE AND I WAS BY

70
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:03,915
MYSELF, AND YOU THOUGHT THERE

71
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,541
WAS EVEN A SHOT THAT DALE WAS

72
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,167
GOING TO SHOW UP WITH AN IDOL, I

73
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,878
WAS TRYING TO FLUSH IT.

74
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,420
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO

75
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,129
SEND HER HOME.

76
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:10,713
AND I I DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME

77
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,340
BUT I WASN'T SURE THE WHO HECK

78
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,299
HE WAS GOING TO PUT DOWN.

79
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,926
>> YOU COULD HAVE LET ME KNOW.

80
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,303
WHEN I SAW MY NAME COME UP TWICE

81
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,597
AT TRIBAL I SAID, "WHAT IN THE

82
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:19,848
WORLD?"

83
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,890
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

84
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,934
MY NAME WASN'T IN THE PLAN.

85
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:23,309
DIMISS THE MEMO?

86
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,645
WHAT IF DALE WOULD HAVE VOTE FOR

87
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:25,979
ME.

88
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:26,855
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 3-3.

89
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,273
>> WE WOULD HAVE DONE A REVOTE

90
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,733
AND WE ALL WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR

91
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:30,942
DALE.

92
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,318
>> DALE WAS ALWAYS WHO WE WANTED

93
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,237
TO GO HOME.

94
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,821
>> MORE LYING.

95
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,155
I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE TO LIE.

96
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:36,531
>> I KNOW.

97
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,658
>> EVERY OTHER BREATH WE DON'T

98
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,450
HAVE TO LIE.

99
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,244
>> I'M TELLING YOU, YOU WERE A

100
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,537
BIG PART OF THIS.

101
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,872
>> I THINK WE COULD MAKE THIS

102
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,540
HAPPEN BUT WHEN STUFF LIKE THAT

103
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,624
HAPPENS, IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE

104
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,667
I AIN'T TOO SURE.

105
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,252
IT WAS MISSY AND BAYLOR THAT

106
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,337
VOTED FOR ME AND THEY GIVE ME

107
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,213
SOME LAME EXCUSE.

108
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,340
WELL, I NEED SOMEBODY THAT STAYS

109
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:54,549
LOYAL.

110
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,550
I'M DONE WITH YOU ALL.

111
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,302
I'LL LEAVE YOU HANGING HIGH AND

BASICALLY SAID WE WERE MERGED.

129
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,459
IT WAS A MIXED EMOTION FEELING

130
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,793
AT THAT POINT BECAUSE WE NEEDED

131
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,629
TO GET RID OF JEREMY, AND WE

132
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,089
DIDN'T DO IT WHEN WE HAD THE

00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,174
CHANCE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT GONE

134
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,842
TO TRIBAL WITH THIS FULL TRIBE.

135
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,260
NOW IT MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE

PRECARIOUS TO GET JEREMY OUT,

137
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,263

00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,452
YOU'RE ALL COMING BACK TOGETHER.

191
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,495
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

192
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,040
STILL STANDS AND WHAT DISSPATED

193
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,500
AND THERE'S THIS BLOOD VERSUS

194
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:34,834
WATER ELEMENT.

195
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,419
YOU HAVE A NATURAL ALLIANCE

196
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,630
BUILT IN THAT IS SO APPARENT,

197
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,049
AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T

198
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:41,591
HAVE THEIR LOVED ONES IN THE

199
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,468
GAME ANYMORE SO IT WILL BE TWO

200
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,552
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

201
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,263
<i>( CHEERS )</i>

202
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:53,061
>> FOOD!

203
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,437
>> I LOVE FOOD!

204
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,064
>> GUYS, THIS IS TOTALLY WORTH

205
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,023
ALL THE SUFFERING.

206
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:57,607
>> I'M DYING RIGHT NOW!

207
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,320
> HAVING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR

208
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,739
16 DAYS AND THEN SEEING THIS

209
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,033
GIANT FEAST WAITING, AND IT'S

210
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,494
GOT CHEESE AND TRAIL MIX AND

211
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,622
BOOZE AND LOBSTER AND SHRIMP AND

212
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,249
IT'S AWESOME!

213
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:15,458
SWEET!

214
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,418
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING IT

215
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,544
TO THE MERGE, GUYS.

216
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,589
>> SUCH A MILESTONE, MAKING THE

217
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,882
MERGE.

218
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,761
LITERALLY AND MENTALLY.

219
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,721
>> ON OUR PREVIOUS TRIBE, WE

220
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,599
JUST HAD ONE COUPLE AND THAT WAS

221
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,809
REED AND JOSH.

222
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,352
THAT WAS A LITTLE ANNOYING, YOU

223
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,603
KNOW, KIND OF SEEING THEM HAVING

224
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,020
THEIR LOVERS' VACAY.

225
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,314
NOW WE ARE MERGED AND HAVE

226
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,607
MULTIPLE LOVED ONE TOGETHER AND

227
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,858
IT'S REALLY TOUGH ON ME BECAUSE

228
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,693
I MISS MY BOYFRIEND JOHN.

229
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,403
I KIND OF WANT TO SEPARATE

230
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,029
MYSELF FROM THE GROUP AND GO CRY

231
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:45,613
A LITTLE BIT.

232
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,908
>> "CONGRATULATIONS, YOU ARE

233
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,283
MERGED.

234
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,494
ENJOY YOUR CELEBRATION THEN HEAD

235
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,663
YOUR NEW HOME, THE FORMER COYOPA

236
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,163
CAMP.

237
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:54,622
THE GAME CONTINUES."

238
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,623
>> YAY!

239
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,583
>> YAY.

240
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,545
>> WE'RE GOING GREEN, GUYS.

241
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,630
>> THAT FEAST WAS THE NUMBER ONE

242
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,341
HIGHLIGHT OF THIS GAME SO FAR.

243
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,384
EVERYTHING WAS GREAT.

244
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,803
WE HAD TO TAKE ALL THE FOOD LEFT

245
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,513
HOME TOW WE COULD HAVE A FEAST

246
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:10,847
TOMORROW, TOO.

247
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,307
>> I'M TAKING ALL OF THIS.

248
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,977
>> YEAH, JULIE, GOOD CALL.

249
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,812
>> I'M EXCITED TO PLAY WITH WES.

250
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,647
IT'S BEEN 16 DAYS, AND YEAH IT

251
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,191
WAS GOOD TO SEE HIM.

252
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,068
>> WHEN SHE WAS BORN, I WAS,

253
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:24,527
LIKE, DIVORCED.

254
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,737
>> I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT MISSY

255
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,989
AND BAYLOR.

256
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:28,573
>> I NEED TWO MORE GUYS OVER

257
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:35,163
HERE ON THIS.

258
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,664
>> THE GAME ALL OF A SUDDEN

259
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,291
SLIKE, SPEEDING.

260
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,292
BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING SO MUCH,

261
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,293
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH EXHAUSTION.

262
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,962
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH JUST MENTAL

263
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,088
MIND CRAZINESS.

264
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,090
AND THEN TO ADD ON TO ALL THAT,

265
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,758
THE ELEMENTS OUT HERE.

266
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,302
IT'S NOT EASY.

267
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,094
>> ARE YOU GOOD?

268
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,554
>> BUT NOW WE'RE MERGED.

269
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,348
AND IT'S A LITTLE DAUNTING WITH

270
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,475
SO MANY PEOPLE, AND IT'S A

271
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,686
LITTLE SCARY, AND IT'S A LITTLE

272
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,270
UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THIS IS

273
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,481
WHERE YOU MAKE OR BREAK IF

274
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,399
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE NUMBERS

275
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:12,700
FOR THE REST OF THIS GAME.

276
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,412
>> WELCOME HOME, GUYS.

277
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,872
>> WE'RE EACH OTHER'S LOVED

278
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:18,080
ONES.

279
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,332
>> THE MERGE IS A MILESTONE, BUT

280
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:19,916
I THINK EVEN MORE THAN THAT,

281
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,626
THIS IS WHERE THE GAME STARTS.

282
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,669
LIKE, THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME

283
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,755
IS THOSE ARE PRELIMBS, YOU KNOW.

284
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,714
THIS IS THE TOTAL DIFFERENT

285
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,799
LEVEL OF PLAY.

286
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,885
LIKE, WE HAVE TO ALL STEP OUR

287
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,302
GAMES OUT.

288
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,262
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING?

289
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:33,721
>> EVERYTHING GOOD?

290
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,473
>> YEAH, THESE DAYS ARE TOUGH,

291
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,057
TO SEE EVERYBODY WITH THEIR

292
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,265
PERSON.

293
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:36,682
>> I KNOW, RIGHT.

294
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,683
>> IT MAKES IT SO--

295
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,644
>> IT HURTS.

296
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,811
>> IT AIN'T RIGHT.

297
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,771
IT AIN'T RIGHT AT ALL.

298
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,773
>> JUST KNOW WHATEVER YOU'RE

299
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,607
FEELING, I'VE GOT THE SAME

300
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:44,815
THING.

301
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,066
>> YEAH.

302
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,442
THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO

303
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,069
CONTINUE ON IN THIS CASE GAME IS

304
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,695
IF I CAN KEEP NUMBERS SO I HAVE

305
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,572
MYSELF, NAT, ALWAYS JULIE.

306
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,533
JULIE'S JUST OUR NUMBER.

307
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:58,454
NOW I NEED TO GET TWO COUPLES,

308
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,248
JON-JACLYN, AND MISSY AND

309
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:00,456
BAYLOR.

310
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,207
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

311
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,333
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT OVER HERE?

312
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,126
>> OBVIOUSLY, MISSY AND US ARE

313
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,418
STILL COOL.

314
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,253
>> GOOD.

315
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,921
>> BUT WES IS DOWN WITH?

316
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:07,255
>> JOSH.

317
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,048
>> AND JOSH IS RUNNING

318
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:09,340
EVERYTHING.

319
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:09,590
>> YEAH.

320
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,843
>> JOSH IS ON HIS GAME RIGHT

321
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,010
NOW.

322
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:13,594
AS SOON AS I GOT HERE, THERE

323
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,263
WERE A FEW PEOPLE I WANTED TO

324
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,931
TALK TO, BUT JON WAS NUMBER ONE

325
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,057
ON THE LIST.

326
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,309
>> SO WE GOT THE FOUR THAT WERE

327
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:20,601
HERE RIGHT.

328
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,143
>> YEAH.

329
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,436
>> AT LEAST.

330
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,021
AND THEN AT LEAST YOU AND

331
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:24,647
NATALIE AND JULIE.

332
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,523
>> YEAH.

333
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,443
>> SO WE HAVE SEVEN.

334
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,528
SO SO WE VOTE JOSH.

335
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,114
>> THE FIRST VIBE I GOT FROM JON

336
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,031
WAS A GOOD JOB.

337
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:34,907
HE HAS JACLYN.

338
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,493
I SAID WE'RE GOOD.

339
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,244
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

340
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:38,786
WE'RE MOVINGED FOR.

341
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:39,829
>> OKAY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

342
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:40,579
>> SO WE'RE GOOD.

343
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:40,913
>> OKAY, GOOD.

344
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:46,127
>> WE HAVE NATE, JULIE, YOU,

345
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,213
BAYLOR, AND WE'VE STILL GOT JON

346
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,047
AND JACLYN.

347
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:50,881
SO WE'VE GOT SEVEN.

348
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,215
>> YEAH, YEAH.

349
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,341
>> WE'RE GOOD.

350
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,342
I KNOW WE'RE GOOD.

351
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,137
>> WE'VE BEEN THAT WAY SINCE THE

352
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,387
BEGINNING.

353
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,638
I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK!

354
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,098
>> MISSY'S BEEN WITH ME SINCE

355
00:09:59,181 --> 00:09:59,348
DAY ONE.

356
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,351
I KNOW I HAVE MISSY AND MISSY

357
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,228
WILL BRING BAYLOR.

358
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:04,562
WE HAVE SEVEN.

359
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,813
THAT'S ALL WE NEED.

360
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,607
>> WE NEED TO COME UP WITH

361
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,360
ANOTHER TRIBE NAME.

362
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,612
>> HUOPA.

363
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,991
>> A COMBINATION OF THE TRIBES.

364
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,620
>> HUOPA.

365
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,203
>> ALLIANCES ARE CRAZY RIGHT

366
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,747
NOW, AND THERE'S A LOT OF MAYHEM

367
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,999
AND A LOVE TALKING GOING ON.

368
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,126
I THINK JEREMY'S BEEN TALKING TO

369
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:27,376
EVERYONE.

370
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,295
HE'S JUST TRYING TO GATHER HIS

371
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,171
TROOPS AROUND BECAUSE HE KNOWS

372
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,089
IT COULD BE THE COUPLES.

373
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,635
>> HASHTAG HUOYOPA.

374
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,803
>> HUOYOPA.

375
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,888
>> THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE

376
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,222
JEREMY DOESN'T GET THE NUMBERS

377
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,015
BEFORE WE GET THE NUMBERS.

378
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,725
BECAUSE BECAUSE IF NOT, I'M

379
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,810
SCREWED.

380
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,911
>> ALL RIGHT.

381
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,787
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

382
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,789
>> YES, IT WAS.

383
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,708
>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

384
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,793
>> THANK YOU, JOSH.

385
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,712
FIRST PERSON TO TELL ME THAT.

386
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,549
AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIM ALL

387
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,425
MORNING.

388
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,135
>> IT'S WESLEY'S BIRTHDAY TODAY.

389
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:18,761
AS A MATTER OF FACT I WOKE UP

390
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,012
THIS MORNING AND FORGOT ALL

391
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,264
ABOUT IT AND JOSH WISHED HIM

392
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,849
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEFORE I DID.

393
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,603
HERE YOU GO, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

394
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,063
ROASTED YOU A CRAB.

395
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,023
>> YOU GOT ONE FOR REAL.

396
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,692
>> DON'T EVER SAY YOUR DAD

397
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,360
DIDN'T PROVIDE FOR YOU.

398
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,362
>> ENJOY YOUR CRAB IN NICARAGUA.

399
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,739
I DID FORGET FOR A MINUTE, BUT

400
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,825
NO BIG DEAL, I DID REMEMBER AND

401
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,743
WISHED HIM A HAPPY EXPWGD

402
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,786
EVERYTHING IS GOOD, HAPPY

403
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,912
BIRTHDAY RIGHT HERE ON THE

404
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,121
BEACH.

405
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:45,746
>> JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

406
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,832
PEOPLE ARE NOT SEEING WHAT

407
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,207
JEREMY IS DOING.

408
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,875
>> I GIVE HIM PROPS BECAUSE HE'S

409
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,127
DOING A GREAT JOB.

410
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,712
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

411
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,214
>> THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE WHO ARE

412
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:55,798
SINGLES, AND EIGHT PEOPLE WHO

413
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,050
ARE COUPLES.

414
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,969
SO I'M THINKING, WHY DON'T WE

415
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,179
STICK TOGETHER AS COUPLES AND BE

416
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,640
ABLE TO GET DOWN TO NUMBERS WITH

417
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,143
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

418
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,936
>> I'M GONNA GUILTY ON BAYLOR

419
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,145
TODAY.

420
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:09,937
>> OKAY.

421
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,149
>> SHE REALLY DOES OWE ME ONE,

422
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,984
LIKE, AND I'M GONNA CALL HER OUT

423
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:15,860
ON THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD AN

424
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,361
ALLIANCE FROM THE BEGINNING.

425
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:17,736
>> YEAH.

426
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,863
>> RIGHT NOW, MY TIGHTEST

427
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,283
ALLIANCE IS ME AND REED, ALEC,

428
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,659
WES, AND KEITH.

429
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,118
BUT THAT'S STILL FIVE.

430
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,995
WE NEED AT LEAST SEVEN.

431
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,497
SO I THINK I CAN STILL GET

432
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,291
BAYLOR TO VOTE WITH ME BECAUSE I

433
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,168
DID SAVE HER ONCE.

434
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,878
AND MISSY IS GOING TO TRANSFER

435
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,338
WITH BAYLOR TO ME.

436
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,506
>> I'M EXCITED TO SEE YOU.

437
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,426
>> DUDE, ME, TOO.

438
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,635
>> ARE WE STILL GOOD?

439
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,595
>> AS FAR AS I KNOW.

440
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,012
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

441
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,096
>> YEAH.

442
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,722
I MEAN--

443
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,807
>> OKAY.

444
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,017
OH, MY GOD, YOUR HAIR.

445
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,893
>> I KNOW.

446
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,311
>> I LOVE IT.

447
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,189
>> AND WITH YOU WE HAVE THE

448
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:53,439
NUMBERS.

449
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,733
>> OH, DANG.

450
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,485
IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE MY MOM

451
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,445
HAS A BUNCH OF ALLIANCES.

452
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,946
I ONLY HAVE ONE STRONG ONE WITH

453
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,155
JOSH.

454
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,158
AND AND SHE'S WITH JON, JACLYN,

455
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:04,533
JEREMY, NATALIE.

456
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,534
AND BEING ALIGNED WITH JOSH

457
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,328
STILL IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME

458
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:07,578
RIGHT NOW.

459
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,830
>> WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE FOUR

460
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,039
COUPLES.

461
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,957
YOU DON'T WANT TO SIDE WITH THE

462
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,250
SINGLE PLAYERS BECAUSE THEN

463
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,335
YOU'RE GOING TO BE TARGETED.

464
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,754
>> STARTING OUT THE GAME, ME AND

465
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,963
JOSH IMMEDIATELY ALIGNED.

466
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,090
AND HE PRETTY MUCH PROTECTED ME.

467
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,383
THAT'S WHAT'S HARDEST FOR ME IS

468
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,551
BEING LIKE, THANK YOU SO MUCH

469
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:22,885
FOR HELPING ME.

470
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,555
NOW I HAVE TO VOTE YOU OUT.

471
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,139
I NEED TO DIGEST AND COME BACK

472
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,600
TO LIFE AND I'M GOING TO GET

473
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,142
BACK IN WITH LIFE AND YOU.

474
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,646
>> NO, NO, TOTALLY, JUST WANT

475
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,480
YOU TO KNOW I STILL HAVE YOUR

476
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,731
BACK.

477
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,315
I CHATTED WITH BARELY AND I'M

478
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,441
LIKE I SAVED YOUR LIFE NOW WE

479
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,817
COME OVER HERE AND YOU'RE GOING

480
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,860
TO IGNORE THAT COMPLETELY?

481
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:44,406
I I HONESTLY, WAS A LITTLE HURT.

482
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,699
>> IT FEELS SKETCHY?

483
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,202
>> YES, VERY SKETCHY.

484
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:48,994
>> THAT'S BECAUSE SHE'S HERE

485
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,704
WITH MISSY.

486
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,081
>> I KNOW, BUT IT'S OUR ONLY

487
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,582
CASE RIGHT NOW.

488
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,168
>> EXACTLY.

489
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,545
>> JOSH CAME UP TO ME ALREADY

490
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,047
AND HE HE WAS LIKE.

491
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:00,339
ARE WE GOOD?

492
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,508
AND I SAID AS FAR AS I KNOW.

493
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,342
HE SAID ME AND YOU.

494
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,177
THAT'S GOING TO REALLY MAKE ME

495
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:05,344
SAD.

496
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,887
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A

497
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,972
CONVERSATION JOSH, MOM.

498
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,724
HE SAID I HAVE YOUR BACK.

499
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,934
ME AND REED HAVE YOUR BACK.

500
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,687
SHOOT.

501
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,896
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE A

502
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,814
LITTLE BIT PHONY.

503
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:17,982
>> I KNOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

504
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,567
BE PHONY BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE

505
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,818
HE WILL RESPECT ME IN THE END

506
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,527
FOR VOTING HIM OUT.

507
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,111
>> HE WILL RESPECT YOU AS A

508
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,988
PLAYER WHEN YOU BLINDSIDE HIM.

509
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,072
JUST SAY I WAS WITH MY MOM.

510
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,658
>> YOU AND HIM ARE EQUAL BUT

511
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,784
YOU'RE MY MOM AND I'M GOING TO

512
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,493
GO WITH YOU,OB.

513
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,745
>> BAYLOR IS 20, AND SOMETIMES

514
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,956
SHE ACTS LIKE SHE'S 30, AND

515
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,957
SOMETIMES SHE ACTS LIKE SHE'S

516
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,000
10.

517
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,418
SHE HAS THIS NEED TO PLEASE.

518
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,586
BUT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO

519
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,255
FIGURE OUT HOW TO HANDLE HER

520
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,923
HEART BECAUSE SHE DOES HAVE A

521
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,216
SWEETHEART, WHEN IT COMES DOWN

522
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,469
TO VOTING REED OR JOSH OUT.

523
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,347
OKAY, YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAID

524
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:50,973
BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO

525
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,851
JEREMY AND HE AND I ARE STILL

526
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,519
LIKE THAT, LIKE WE WERE AT THE

527
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:55,811
BEGINNING.

528
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:56,312
>> OKAY.

529
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,815
>> BAYLOR-- BAYLOR, WE HAVE THE

530
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:01,692
BERS AND JOSH KNOW KNOWS AND AND

531
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,611
JOSH IS FREAKING OUT.

532
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,320
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

533
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,070
IT'S A GAME.

534
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:05,362
SUCK IT UP.

535
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,948
JUST SMILE, AND BE LIKE, "OH,

536
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,033
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

537
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,159
I'LL TALK TO MY MOM."

538
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,244
OKAY.

539
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,203
BUT JUST SMILE TO EVERYBODY

540
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:13,495
RIGHT NOW.

541
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,873
>> I KNOW SHE RESPECTS ME, BUT

542
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,166
THE DIFFERENCE TO ME IS SHE'S

543
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,626
COMING TO ME AND ASKING ME

544
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,294
QUESTIONS AND IT FEELS PRETTY

545
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:20,502
GOOD.

546
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,130
IT'S LIKE, OKAY, YEAH, I'VE MADE

547
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,423
SOME BAD DECISIONS IN MY LIFE

548
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,592
AND SHE HAD TO STAND BY AND

549
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,052
WATCH THEM AND I FEEL PRETTY

550
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:28,469
CRAPPY ABOUT THAT.

551
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,053
NO MOM IS PROUD TO BE DIVORCED

552
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:29,637
ONE, TWO, OR THREE TIMES AND

553
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,680
ESPECIALLY HAVING TO HAVE YOUR

554
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,931
KID WATCH YOU GO THROUGH IT.

555
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,767
BUT I GET TO REDEEM MYSELF AND

556
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,934
SHE'S WATCHING IT.

557
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,269
SHE'S BACK TO BEING MY KID AND

558
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,147
SHE'S LISTENING TO ME.

559
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,148
I'M LIKE TRUST ME ON THIS.

560
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,983
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

561
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,985
GET IN THE BACK SEAT AND LET ME

562
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,194
DRIVE.

563
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,320
WE'RE GOING TO HEAD DOWN THIS

564
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,571
PATH AND WE'LL BE FINE BUT YOU

565
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:53,077
HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

566
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,704
>> I FEEL LIKE THE TIME THAT

567
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,331
BAIL OFFICE AWAY FROM ME, THAT

568
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,375
SHE REALLY GOT UNDER HER MOM'S

569
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,084
INFLUENCE IN DIVERTING HER AWAY

570
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,295
FROM MYSELF AND REED SO NOW I

571
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,005
HAVE NO OTHER OPTION.

572
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,256
BESIDES JON AND JACLYN, WE HAVE

573
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,174
TO MAKE A PLAY FOR THESE PEOPLE

574
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:11,595
OR WE WILL BE OUT OF THE

575
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,137
NUMBERS.

576
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,766
>> I THINK THAT LOOKS REALLY

577
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:15,974
GOOD.

578
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,309
THAT IS REALLY COOL.

579
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,146
I LIKE THE COLORS.

580
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,024
>> HEY, YOU GUYS CAN I JUST SAY

581
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:24,400
SOMETHING TO YOU.

582
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:24,858
>> YES.

583
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,151
>> REED AND I REALLY WOULD LOVE

584
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,695
TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS.

585
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,531
WE FEEL LIKE GETTING IN BED WITH

586
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,198
JEREMY, I THINK HE IS GONNA BE

587
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,283
THE STRONGEST COMPETITOR.

588
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,910
HE'S THE ONE WORKING WITH THE

589
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:35,077
MOST.

590
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,496
HE'S THE ONE TALKING TO.

591
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:37,705
AND--

592
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:37,913
>> YEAH.

593
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,832
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND SO

594
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,999
JUST IN A PERSPECTIVE THING, WHO

595
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,583
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

596
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,085
GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS TO, TWO

597
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,211
BROADWAY GUYS WHO ARE VERY

598
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,588
SUCCESSFUL OR A FIREMAN WHO HAS

599
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:46,839
TWO KIDS?

600
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,092
>> I KNOW.

601
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,344
>> SO THAT'S MY PLEA TO YOU

602
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:52,553
GUYS.

603
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,887
>> YEAH, THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

604
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,681
>> AND I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU

605
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,474
GUYS KNOW THAT'S WHERE MY HEAD'S

606
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:57,891
AT.

607
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,560
>> THANKS.

608
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,686
>> HEY, MISSY.

609
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,729
>> HI.

610
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,355
>> JOSH APPROACHED JACLYN AND I,

611
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,858
AND SAID,UN," WE WOULD LOVE TO

612
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,775
WORK WITH YOU."

613
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,359
HE PRETTY MUCH SAID,"LOOK, WE

614
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,361
WANT TO GET TO THE FINAL THREE

615
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,279
BUT WE DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING

616
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,740
ON TO ACTUALLY BE THE ONES TO

617
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,198
WIN IT.

618
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,868
ONCE AGAIN WE FIND OURSELVES IN

619
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,410
THE MIDDLE.

620
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,787
IT SEEMS JACLYN AND I BECAME A

621
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,205
POWER COUPLE ONCE THE TRIBE SWAP

622
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:20,456
HAPPENED.

623
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,458
TWO COUPLES, WE WERE KIND OF IN

624
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,543
THE MIDDLE AND BOTH OF THEM

625
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,004
NEEDED OUR HELP SO WE'RE BEING

626
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,505
GIVEN A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO

627
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:28,922
CONTROL OUR FATE.

628
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,257
>> THIS VOTE IS HUGE.

629
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,884
>> YEAH, THIS IS THE DECISION.

630
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,094
JOSH AND REED SEEMED

631
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,305
LEGITIMATELY TIED TO KEEPING

632
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,973
COUPLES COULD WOULD GIVE US THE

633
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:38,348
TOP SIX.

634
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,267
BUT THEY MAKE ( BLEEP ) STUFF

635
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,685
UP.

636
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,186
THEY'RE BROADWAY STARS.

637
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:42,519
>> IT'S TRUE.

638
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,771
I DON'T KNOW.

639
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,396
IT'S THE EXACT SAME STORY AGAIN

640
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,230
WITH ME AND JON.

641
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,483
WE ARE FOR SURE IN THE MIDDLE.

642
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,736
SO IT'S, LIKE WHICH WAY DO ME

643
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,570
AND JON GO?

644
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,113
>> THIS IS LIKE A BIG DECISION.

645
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,948
>> I KNOW.

646
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,158
IT'S REALLY STRESSFUL BECAUSE

647
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,869
ONE WRONG VOTE COULD BE A

648
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,496
MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION.

649
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,783
>> I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS

650
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,409
LOOKING OUT FOR ANY FOOD THAT'S

651
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,036
JUST LAYING AROUND, AND AT THIS

652
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,538
POINT I STILL HAVE A LITTLE

653
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,580
TRAIL MIX I TOOK FROM FEAST BUT

654
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,790
I'M KEEPING THEM IN MY BAG AND

655
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,625
NOW I FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY.

656
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,127
I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO THROW IT

657
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:49,670
OUT BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS

658
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,338
MUNCHED OUT ON EVERYTHING THEY

659
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:51,922
HAD ALREADY.

660
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,549
IF I SHOWED EVERYBODY WHAT I HAD

661
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,132
IT WOULD BE GONE LIKE THAT.

662
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,008
I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO GATHER IT,

663
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,093
SO IT'S MINE.

664
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,220
>> I HAVE SOME SOME OF THE

665
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,014
LEFTOVER NUTS AND APRICOTS AND

666
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,392
DATES, AND I'LL SHARE WITH WHO I

667
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,477
WANT.

668
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,363
>> WHERE IS JULIE?

669
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:31,712
>> ON A WALK, I THINK.

670
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,254
OH, YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

671
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,755
>> SHUT UP!

672
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,842
>> YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

673
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,606
>> MISSING TRAIL MIX.

674
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,232
WE FOUND OUT JULIE HAS IT IN HER

675
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,276
BAG, THE SMALLEST GIRL HERE, IT

676
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,195
IS ONE OF THE MOST SELFISH

677
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,115
THINGS YOU COULD DO IN

678
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:00,908
"SURVIVOR" I FEEL LIKE.

679
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,491
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PISSED

680
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,869
OFF AT HER FOR THAT, AND WE'RE

681
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,078
PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE IT FROM

682
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,580
HER BAG AND EAT IT ALL.

683
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,749
>> OH, MY GOSH.

684
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,460
>> BAIL OHURRY, HURRY!

685
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,505
>> GIVE ME SOME!

686
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,381
>> THERE IS SO MUCH IN THERE.

687
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,091
>> I AM BEYOND MAD.

688
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:22,721
>> WHAT A SELFISH LITTLE-- OOH!

689
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,556
>> AT HOME, OKAY, YOU TAKE TRAIL

690
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,682
MIX, NO BIG DEAL.

691
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,308
IT'S TRAIL MIX.

692
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,142
WHO CARES?

693
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,144
HERE, WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO

694
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:29,645
EAT.

695
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,104
SHE'S SELFISH, AND SHE'S AWFUL,

696
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,774
AND I CAN'T TRUST SOMEBODY IN MY

697
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,900
ALLIANCE WHO IS STEALING

698
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,109
PEOPLE'S FOOD.

699
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,486
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

700
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,656
>> JON, BREATHE.

701
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,698
DEEP BREATHS.

702
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,824
>> IS SHE COMING BACK?

703
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,408
>> OH, MY GOD.

704
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,286
>> THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO ME.

705
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,413
>> WHY DOES SHE THINK SHE'S SO

706
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,414
MUCH BETTER THAN US AND SHE CAN

707
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,540
DO THAT.

708
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,250
>> IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING I

709
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,627
WHEN I WALKED BACK UP TO CAMP IT

710
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,420
WAS LITERALLY, LIKE, YOU COULD

711
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,506
SLICE TENSION WITH A KNIFE.

712
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,259
>> I'M A PRETTY OBSERVANT

713
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:01,510
PERSON.

714
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,803
IT DOESN'T TAKE A BRILLIANT

715
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,512
PERSON TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

716
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,972
GOING ON RIGHT HERE.

717
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,181
>> LIKE, SO ENTITLED.

718
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:08,475
>> I FEEL LIKE SOME OF MY TRIBE

719
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,310
MATES KNOW I WAS HOARDING OR

720
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,229
STEALING TRAIL MIX, AND RIGHT

721
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,147
NOW I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT A FIRE

722
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:14,815
UNDER MY BUTT.

723
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:15,440
SO THINGS DON'T LOOK SO GOOD FOR

724
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:28,412
ME RIGHT NOW.

725
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:33,750
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

726
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,418
>> I'M DEFINITELY IN THE MOST

727
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,169
PRECARIOUS SITUATION I'VE BEEN

728
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,713
IN, IN THIS GAME YET.

729
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,338
WITHOUT JON AND JACLYN ON BOARD,

730
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,548
IT'S STILL NOT A MAJORITY.

731
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,842
I THINK MY NAME WILL BE ON THE

732
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,051
CHOPPING BLOCK, SO I'M JUST

733
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,012
GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND TRY TO

734
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:50,809
WIN AND FIGHT TO THE END.

735
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,270
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

736
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,147
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

737
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,564
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

738
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,273
>> YES!

739
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,734
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

740
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,568
BAYLOR, TRIBAL IMMUNITY IS NO

741
00:21:59,651 --> 00:21:59,735
MORE.

742
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:06,283
THIS IS WHAT YOU COVET.

743
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,409
>> SO BEAUTIFUL!

744
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,326
>> Jeff: IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

745
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:08,744
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

746
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,579
WITH THIS AROUND YOUR NECK, ARE

747
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,621

AT REGULAR INTERVALS, YOU WILL

AND YOU HAVE TWO ROPES.

MORE THAN THE OTHER, THAT WILL

781
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,641
CAUSE MOVEMENT.

782
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,726
YOU NOT ONLY HAVE TO CONTEND

937
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,140
CHALLENGES.

938
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,933
I'M TERRIBLE AT THESE

939
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:29,225
CHALLENGES.

940
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:29,851
>> WELL DONE!

941
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,478
>> WOW!

942
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:35,398
>> I WAS OUT BEFORE AN OLD GUY.

943
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,609
>> IT WAS FUN TO WATCH YOU AND

944
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:37,859
YOUR DAD.

945
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,151
>> A MOM.

946
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,612
>> SHE'S REALLY PLAYING HARD,

947
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:40,862
HUNAHPU.

948
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,404
>> SHE'S OVER THERE TANNING.

949
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,449
>> JEWEL-- I WAS OUT BEFORE

950
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:44,657
JULIE.

951
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,828
I WAS OUT BEFORE JULIE.

952
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,162
UNBELIEVABLE.

953
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:49,704
BUT GOING INTO THE TRIBAL

954
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:52,290
COUNCIL TONIGHT, I FEEL LIKE I'M

955
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:52,499
SAFE.

956
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,626
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

957
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,550
>> OH, BABY I KNOW.

958
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,636
I HEAR YA.

959
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,352
>> IT'S SO HOT.

960
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,312
I CAN'T EVEN DRINK IT YET.

961
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,356
>> I SURE WOULD LOVE THE TRAIL

962
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:29,202
MIX.

963
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:33,039
>> I HEARD ALEC'S LITTLE PUNK

964
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:33,915
BUTT SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT

965
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,207
TRAIL MIX.

966
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,041
I'M DEFINITELY ANGRY, BUT I

967
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,252
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

968
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,920
I'M JUST-- I'M REALLY LOST.

969
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,798
I'M FEELING REALLY LOW.

970
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,926
I'M FEELING LOST AND CONFUSED.

971
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:45,885
>> THE PAST THREE, FOUR DAYS

972
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,846
I'VE JUST KIND OF, LIKE-- IT'S

973
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,222
JUST TOUGH.

974
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,892
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT-- I'M ALMOST

975
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,978
EVERY NIGHT NOT QUITE ABLE TO

976
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,187
GET MY HEAD BACK IN THE GAME.

977
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,939
I DON'T KNOW-- I DON'T KNOW.

978
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,817
>> YOU FEEL LIKE YICY.

979
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,110
>> A LITTLE BIT.

980
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,486
>> YOU FEEL LIKE DONE.

981
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,153
>> ALMOST.

982
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,655
>> TOAST?

983
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,740
REMEMBER YOU HAD A TOUGHER TIME

984
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,908
THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE JOHN

985
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,201
GOT VOTED OUT SUPER EARLY.

986
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,619
>> IT IS DIFFICULT WITH ALL THIS

987
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,870
HERE WHEN EVERYBODY HAS THEIR

988
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,121
LOVED ONE.

989
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,831
>> I KNOW.

990
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:15,582
WELL, I'M YOUR LOVED ONE.

991
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,624
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

992
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,166
>> HANG IN THERE.

993
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,585
>> I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

994
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,837
BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE-- I'M NOT

995
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,045
SURE.

996
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,422
MY HEAD'S KIND OF TELLING ME

997
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:22,589
TO--

998
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,007
>> GET OUT?

999
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,507
>> YEAH.

1000
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,008
>> DON'T DO IT YET.

1001
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,968
>> JUST BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S

1002
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,219
SO MUCH MORE TO ENDURE.

1003
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:28,511
>> THERE IS.

1004
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,222
>> I FEEL LIKE IF I DON'T GET A

1005
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,974
LITTLE SPACE I'M GOING TO LOSE

1006
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,934
MY ( BLEEP ) MIND.

1007
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,312
>> SHE STOLE FOOD AND PUT

1008
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,023
IT IN HER BAG AND DIDN'T SHARE

1009
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,816
WITH ANYBODY AND IT'S OBNOXIOUS,

1010
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:42,650
IT IS.

1011
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,277
JULIE GOES HOME AND IT MESSES US

1012
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:44,527
UP.

1013
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,154
ONE MESS-UP VOTE AT TRIBAL

1014
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,989
THROWS THIS PLAN INTO THE

1015
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:48,239
TOILET.

1016
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,032
LET'S NOT DO IT TONIGHT.

1017
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,743
CAN YOU WAIT ONE MORE DAY?

1018
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,201
>> YEAH.

1019
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:52,952
>> CAN WE GET THROUGH THIS PLAN?

1020
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:53,286
>> YEAH.

1021
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,079
>> I NEEDED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

1022
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,039
I FELT LIKE I COULD TALK TO

1023
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,166
MISSY, BUT WHEN SHE TOLD ME TO

1024
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,083
STICK IT OUT, "I'M HERE FOR YOU.

1025
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,794
I'M YOUR LOVED ONE.

1026
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,714
I'M YOUR LOVED ONE WHEN JOHN'S

1027
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:04,922
GONE.

1028
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:05,256
JUST DO THIS.

1029
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,549
WE NEED YOU."

1030
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,967
>> OKAY?

1031
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,552
>> YEAH, HUGS.

1032
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,178
I GET IT.

1033
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,472
I'M A SMART GAL.

1034
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,641
THEY NEED ME TO GET FURTHER

1035
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,516
BASED ON USING ME.

1036
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,518
I'M NOT GOING TO HATE THEM FOR

1037
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:17,935
IT.

1038
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:18,519
IT'S THE WAY THE GAME GOES.

1039
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,105
I CAN SEE WHAT THAT IS AND I CAN

1040
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,190
MAKE A DECISION RIGHT NOW BASED

1041
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:27,236
ON WHAT I NEED.

1042
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,865
>> THEY'RE STILL AFTER YOU HARD

1043
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:31,074
CORE.

1044
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:31,699
THEY'RE GOING TO BE PRETENDING

1045
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,368
JULIE, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1046
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,994
>> WHAT'S THEIR REASONING TO SAY

1047
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:35,161
ME?

1048
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:35,787
>> THEY SAID YOU'RE GOING TO WIN

1049
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,247
ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

1050
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:38,539
CHALLENGES.

1051
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,708
>> DON'T THEY KNOW-- I SUCK AT

1052
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,710
THESE IMMUNITY CHALLENGES?

1053
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,295
LIKE I'M OUT FIRST,UN WHAT I

1054
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:44,504
MEAN?

1055
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:44,879
>> YEAH, YOU WERE.

1056
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,130
>> THEY'RE JUST MAKING STUFF UP.

1057
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,049
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1058
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:48,466
>> YEAH.

1059
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,092
>> BUT THEY DON'T HAVE NUMBERS,

1060
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,718
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1061
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,971
>> YEAH IT, DOESN'T MATTER.

1062
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,640
>> JOSH IS THE ONLY ONE IN

1063
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,766
JOSH' ALLIANCE THAT IS PLAYING

1064
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,183
THE GAME.

1065
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,019
IF YOU TAKE HIM OUT, IT'S OVER.

1066
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,647
>> WE JUST GO ON JOSH.

1067
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,940
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN

1068
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:04,524
SAYING.

1069
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,068
>> ALL RIGHT.

1070
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,070
>> THIS IS MY HOME TURF.

1071
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,988
BUT I HAVE TO GIVE JEREMY PROPS

1072
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,782
BECAUSE HE IS PLAYING THIS GAME,

1073
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,118
AND ACTUALLY, HE'S PLAYING IT

1074
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:15,326
WELL.

1075
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,160
IT JUST IS OPPOSITE TO WHAT I'M

1076
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,831
DOING, SO IT'S FRUSTRATING.

1077
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,039
>> HI.

1078
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,084
>> WE HAVE TO GET JACLYN AND

1079
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,420
JON.

1080
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,255
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO GO

1081
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,550
COUPLES TOGETHER AND SINGLES

1082
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:30,717
OUT.

1083
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,634
BLOOD VERSUS WATER.

1084
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,636
THAT'S WHAT THIS GAME IS ABOUT.

1085
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,220
WHY DON'T WE GET RID OF THE

1086
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,139
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THEIR

1087
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:42,019
LOVED ONES ANYMORE?

1088
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,191
>> WE DON'T STICK TOGETHER AND

1089
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,192
JEREMY-- IF HE GETS FIVE VOTES

1090
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:52,071
AND DOESN'T GET VOTEDDED OFF

1091
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,239
HE'S GOIN TO BE PISSED AND

1092
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,949
COMING AFTER EVERY ONE OF US.

1093
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:56,159
>> AND JEREMY IS GOING TO BE

1094
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,201
TAKE OUT THE COUPLES.

1095
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,746
>> IS HE.

1096
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,205
>> AND WE ALSO GET TO BE HERE

1097
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,541
WITH OUR LOVED ONE AND HAVING A

1098
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,084
LOVED ONE MAKES IT MORE OF A

1099
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,210
CALM RAWDY THING.

1100
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,255
THEN ONCE WE GET IT DOWN TO

1101
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:09,756
EIGHT WE'LL DUKE IT OUT.

1102
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,923
>> I'M IN.

1103
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:11,716
>> I LOVE THIS PLAN.

1104
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,384
>> AFTER LOOKING AT THE OPTIONS,

1105
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,802
FEELING OUT THE PEOPLE, I'VE

1106
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,179
FOUND MYSELF MAKING A COMPLETE

1107
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,181
180 IN TERMS OF WHAT ALLIANCES

1108
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,058
I AM SUPPORTING.

1109
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,185
>> THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, I

1110
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,311
JUST CAN'T TRUST JEREMY.

1111
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,730
>> WE'RE NOT GOING WITH HIM?

1112
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,272
>> NO.

1113
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,523
WE'LL GET JEREMY OUT TONIGHT.

1114
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,691
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1115
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,150
>> BLINDSIDE HIM.

1116
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,360
>> ARE WE REALLY?

1117
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,153
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE THAT'S HUGE.

1118
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,446
>> WHAT.

1119
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,697
>> THAT WE'RE GOING THE OTHER

1120
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,031
WAY NOW.

1121
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,574
>> I DON'T EVEN WANT TO JUMP,

1122
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,993
IT'S JUST THE BEST THING FOR OUR

1123
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:39,160
GAME.

1124
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,077
>> ANOTHER I FEEL GOOD ABOUT

1125
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:40,369
THAT, YEAH.

1126
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:40,578
OKAY.

1127
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,497
>> IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO

1128
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,915
BE GOING ON THE COUPLES TRAIN,

1129
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,333
AND VOTING JEREMY OUT TONIGHT.

1130
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,628
IT'S GOING TO SUCK BECAUSE I

1131
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,671
REALLY LIKE JEREMY, BUT WE'VE

1132
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,340
GOT TO DO, THIS WE GOTTA DO IT.

1133
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,883
>> THAT SUCTION.

1134
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:54,717
>> YUP.

1135
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,302
I PREACHED AGAINST JUMPING SHIP

1136
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,262
BEFORE BECAUSE IF YOU JUMP SHIP

1137
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,263
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE BOTTOM

1138
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,642
OF THE TOTEM POLE, BUT WE ARE A

1139
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,184
COUPLE.

1140
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,354
SO I'M GOING WITH JOSH, REED,

1141
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,190
ALEC, WES, AND KEITH HAS MORE

1142
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,525
LONG-TERM POTENTIAL WITH FEWER

1143
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:16,155
BUMPS IN THE ROAD.

1144
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,157
>> WHERE'S JULIE?

1145
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,200
>> WITH HER BAG.

1146
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,118
SHE WALKED THAT WAY.

1147
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,371
>> I THINK SHE TOTALLY HEARD ME

1148
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:23,788
JUST HATING ON HER.

1149
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,372
>> SHE DEFINITELY HEARD YOU.

1150
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,416
>> WELL, IT NEEDED TO HAPPEN.

1151
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,668
SOMEBODY NEEDED TO SAY IT, SO I

1152
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:28,876
DID IT.

1153
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,461
YOU GUYS ALL THOUGHT IT, AND I

1154
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:30,962
SAID IT.

1155
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,215
>> DAMN IT.

1156
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,218
>> I DON'T THINK SHE'LL QUIT.

1157
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,303
SHE TOLD ME SHE WOULDN'T QUIT,

1158
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:39,512
SHOW.

1159
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,098
SHE SAID SHE WOULDN'T WOULDN'T.

1160
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,393
>> I NEVER THOUGHT IN MY WILDEST

1161
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,310
DREAMS THAT BLOOD VERSUS WATER

1162
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,478
WOULD BE THIS DIFFICULT.

1163
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,604
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST THREE

1164
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,230
WEEKS OF MY LIFE AWAY FROM THE

1165
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,232
MAN I LOVE.

1166
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,235
AND IT'S, LIEB, TAKING A TOLL ON

1167
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:54,402
ME.

1168
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,070
HEY, JEFF.

1169
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:58,739
THANKS FOR COMING OUT.

1170
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,284
>> Jeff: WHAT'S GOING ON?

1171
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,495
>> UM, I'VE KIND OF LOST MY HEAD

1172
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,371
THE PAST THREE, FOUR DAYS, AND

1173
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,124
I'VE BEEN TRYING MY BEST TO

1174
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,834
REGROUP AND SHAKE MY HEAD BACK

1175
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:13,462
IN BUT I HAVEN'T QUITE GOT BACK

1176
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:13,671
THERE.

1177
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,799
AND TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF THESE

1178
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,175
COUPLES, IT BRINGS ME RIGHT BACK

1179
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,343
TO I WAS DOING THIS WHOLE THING

1180
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,262
WITH JOHN.

1181
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,514
AND BEING HERE WITH ALL OF THESE

1182
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,224
PEOPLE THAT ARE IN LOVE, ARE

1183
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,977
FAMILY MEMBERS, IT'S-- IT'S THAT

1184
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,021
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT ON TOP OF

1185
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,063
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S

1186
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:31,314
HAPPENING.

1187
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:31,898
>> Jeff: TELL ME ABOUT YOUR

1188
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,398
RELATIONSHIP WITH JOHN.

1189
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,151
ARE YOU GUYS ALWAYS TOGETHER?

1190
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:35,776
>> THIS SUMMER'S THREE YEARS,

1191
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,738
AND WE HAVE NOT GONE MORE THAN

1192
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,447
FOUR DAYS WITHOUT SEEING EACH

1193
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,991
GLRG SO YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP

1194
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,409
IN WHICH BEING APART IS JUST NOT

1195
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,368
WHAT WE DO, AND SO SUDDENLY THE

1196
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,329
THOUGHT OF BEING OUT HERE

1197
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:46,787
ANOTHER 21 DAYS IS--

1198
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,205
>> HEAVY.

1199
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:48,831
>> Jeff: OVERWHELMING.

1200
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,166
>> OVERWHELMING IS THE WORD.

1201
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,584
>> Jeff: BUT KIDS GO TO SUMMER

1202
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,376
CAMP LONGER THAN WE'RE OUT HERE.

1203
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,920
>> RIGHT.

1204
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,046
>> Jeff: THEY LEAVE THEIR

1205
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:55,296
PARENTS.

1206
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:55,671
>> RIGHT.

1207
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,297
>> Jeff: PARENTS LET THEIR

1208
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,548
KIDS GO.

1209
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,090
>> RIGHT.

1210
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:58,633
>> Jeff: WE KNOW THAT WE CAN

1211
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,051
LEAVE PEOPLE THAT WE LOVE.

1212
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:00,760
>> SURE, SURE.

1213
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,136
>> Jeff: SO IS PART OF THIS

1214
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:02,803
THAT YOU FEEL YOU'RE ALREADY OUT

1215
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,055
OF THE GAME?

1216
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:04,305
>> YES.

1217
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,266
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE FOR PEOPLE

1218
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,809
TO SAY JULIE, IT SOUNDS LIKE

1219
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,393
YOU'RE GIVING UP BECAUSE YOU

1220
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,021
THINK YOU'RE OUT AND YOU JUST

1221
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:12,772
WANT TO BE WITH JOHN.

1222
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,108
>> I CAME IN HERE DAY ONE BEING

1223
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:16,317
JUDGED.

1224
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,610
I'M JUDGED CONSTANTLY.

1225
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,319
>> Jeff: WHY DO YOU THINK

1226
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,112
YOU'RE JUDGED SO QUICKLY?

1227
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,781
>> MAYBE THEY SEE ME AS SOMEBODY

1228
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,574
THEY CAN'T APPROACH, OR SOMEBODY

1229
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,700
THEY CAN'T TRUST BECAUSE I TAKE

1230
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,785
CARE OF MYSELF.

1231
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,119
MAYBE IT SEEMS I WOULDN'T BE

1232
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,248
DOWN TO EARTH, MAYBE TOO VAIN.

1233
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,833
AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MY

1234
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,377
BOOBS, LIKE MAKING JOKES, LIKE

1235
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:34,794
MEAN GIRLS.

1236
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,378
>> Jeff: SO THE FACT THAT YOU

1237
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,588
THINK YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH ON THE

1238
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,381
VERGE OF BEING VOTE OUT AND YOUR

1239
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,967
MAN'S NOT HERE-- I'M DONE.

1240
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,094
>> AND I CAN'T STAY HERE BECAUSE

1241
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,553
MISSY SAYS, "WE NEED YOU."

1242
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,304
I KNOW WHY YOU NEED ME.

1243
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,515
IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO BE

1244
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,975
HERE TO HELP YOU GET FURTHER IN

1245
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:49,725
THE GAME.

1246
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,310
BUT I'M COMPROMISING WHAT I FEEL

1247
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,187
I NEED RIGHT NOW.

1248
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,189
>> Jeff: AND WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE

1249
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:55,815
ROWHOARE IN AN ALLIANCE WITH YOU

1250
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,817
AND THE FACT IF THEY ARE, THEY

1251
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,486
JUST LOST A MEMBER JAI FEEL VERY

1252
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,113
BUILT ABOUT THAT, I DO.

1253
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,574
>> Jeff: IT IS QUITE POSSIBLY

1254
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,826
A MILLION-DOLLAR QUIT FOR

1255
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:07,159
SOMEONE ELSE.

1256
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,370
>> IT MAKES ME FEEL AWFUL BUT I

1257
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,496
CANNOT COMPROMISE WHAT I'M

1258
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,289
NEEDING RIGHT NOW BASED ON WHAT

1259
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,291
THEY NEED BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

1260
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:14,500
THEM.

1261
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,626
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JULIE.

1262
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,044
SO OFFICIALLY, YOU'RE QUITTING

1263
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:17,753
THE GAME.

1264
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,004
>> YES.

1265
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,922
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1266
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,842
18 DAYS, YOUR ADVENTURE IS OVER.

1267
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,802
I'LL GO LET THE TRIBE KNOW.

1268
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:33,185
>> ANOTHER THANK YOU.

1269
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,071
>> OKAY, SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

1270
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,282
>> Jeff: GUYS, COME ON DOWN

1271
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,616
OUT OF THE SHELTER.

1272
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,285
THERE'S A LOG UP HERE.

1273
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:58,586
LET'S JUST SIT ON THIS.

1274
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,380
ALL RIGHT, SO, BAD NEWS AND GOOD

1275
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:01,589
NEWS.

1276
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,341
BAD NEWS IS IF YOU WERE IN AN

1277
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,593
ALLIANCE WITH JULIE, YOU JUST

1278
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,471
LOST A MEMBER.

1279
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,723
JULIE IS QUITTING THE GAME.

1280
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:14,226
>> WOW.

1281
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,561
>> AS SOON AS JEFF SAYS JULIE'S

1282
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,021
GONE, I INSTANTLY THINK ABOUT

1283
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,105
THE NUMBERS.

1284
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,273
SHE WAS MY NUMBER.

1285
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,024
I NEEDED THAT.

1286
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,525
SO NOW I COULD BE GOING HOME

1287
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,027
TONIGHT.

1288
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,237
>> HOW CAN SOMEBODY DO THAT?

1289
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,781
>> Jeff: SOME PEOPLE

1290
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,240
DISAPPOINTED, SOME PEOPLE

1291
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:28,449
SMILING.

1292
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,575
>> I'M JUST SAD BECAUSE I TALKED

1293
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,451
TO HER LAST TODAY.

1294
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,703
YOU KNOW, I DON'T TAKE ANY

1295
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,038
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT BUT I WISH

1296
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:34,622
I COULD HAVE TALKED TO HER ONE

1297
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,748
MORE TIME.

1298
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,624
>> Jeff: JOSH, IT'S A

1299
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:36,999
COMPLICATED GAME.

1300
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,667
ON ONE HAPPENED, YOU DON'T WANT

1301
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,919
SOMEBODY TO QUIT, ESPECIALLY IF

1302
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,420
YOU'RE THE PERSON THAT'S IN AN

1303
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,588
ALLIANCE WITH THEM.

1304
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,506
ON THE OTHER HAND, MY ODDS JUST

1305
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,508
GOT BETTER BY ONE.

1306
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,842
>> IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

1307
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,427
YOUR CHANCES JUST GOT BETTER IN

1308
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,263
THAT CASE, UNLESS SHE WAS YOUR

1309
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,556
ONLY ALLIANCE, AND THEN, OF

1310
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,933
COURSE, MAYBE YOU THINK YOU'RE

1311
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,267
SCREWED AFTER THAT.

1312
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,728
JULIE QUIT THE GAME, WHICH PUTS

1313
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,521
JEREMY AND THAT ALLIANCE A

1314
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,565
LITTLE MORE AT AN EASE BECAUSE

1315
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,193
THEY HAVE ONE LESS NUMBER.

1316
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:04,819
AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

1317
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,862
OUR ODDS ARE BETTER AT TRIBAL

1318
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,531
TONIGHT TO GET JEREMY OUT.

1319
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,658
>> Jeff: JEREMY, WHAT DOES IT

1320
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,284
SAY ABOUT THOSE WHO JUST GIVE

1321
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:12,451
UP?

1322
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,202
>> IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1323
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,537
AND IT PISSES ME OFF WHEN PEOPLE

1324
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,206
QUIT AS IT IS YOU KNOW WHAT I

1325
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:17,414
MEAN?

1326
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,374
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE HER

1327
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,542
COMFORTABLE AND GIVE HER FOOD,

1328
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,085
KEEP HER WARM AT NIGHT.

1329
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,545
IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS.

1330
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:22,753
IT'S--

1331
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,964
>> AND IT SEEMS LIKE JULIE HAD

1332
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,257
LIFE THE EASIEST OF ANYBODY

1333
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,800
AROUND HERE BECAUSE SHE DID

1334
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,008
NOTHING.

1335
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:28,968
YOU KNOW?

1336
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:29,135
SO--

1337
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,554
>> SHE DUG HERSELF A BIT OF A

1338
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:31,762
HOLE.

1339
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,013
>> SHE DUG HERSELF NAY HOLE.

1340
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:33,597
>> Jeff: DO YOU THINK, JACLYN,

1341
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,183
PARENT OF THE REASON SHE QUIT IS

1342
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,268
SHE FELT SHE WAS IN A HOLE?

1343
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,061
>> YEAH, IT PROBABLY HAD A BIG

1344
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:39,478
PART.

1345
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,230
AFTER THE MERGE FEAST WE HAD,

1346
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,940
SHE DUMP AID BUNCH OF TRAIL MIX

1347
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,275
IN HER BAG AND HID IT FROM

1348
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:44,900
EVERYBODY AND WE FOUND IT TODAY.

1349
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,069
I MEAN, FOOD IS HUGE OUT HERE,

1350
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,821
AND IF YOU JUST, LIKE, TAKE

1351
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,281
SOMETHING AND HIDE IT FROM

1352
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,782
EVERYBODY AND KEEP IT IT TO

1353
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,492
YOURSELF, LIKE, IT MAKES PEOPLE

1354
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:53,659
MAD.

1355
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,618
>> Jeff: SO, JON, DO YOU THINK

1356
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,203
PART OF THIS MIGHT BE SHE FEARED

1357
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,246
SHE WAS GOING HOME?

1358
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:57,830
>> I THINK EVEN MORE SO IT'S

1359
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,999
THAT SHE WAS JUST SO SCARED OF

1360
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,959
LIVING UP TO THE FACT THAT, OH,

1361
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,919
YEAH, I AM A SELFISH PERSON.

1362
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:04,503
I DON'T THINK SHE COULD DEAL

1363
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,756
WITH IT.

1364
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,966
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, THERE IS

1365
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,676
GOOD NEWS.

1366
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:15,014
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1367
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,766
WHICH MEANS, SOMEBODY MAYBE JUST

1368
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,478
GOT A MILLION-DOLLAR BREAK.

1369
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,688
GUYS, HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

1370
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,481
I HOPE YOU STAY DRY.

1371
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,191
THE GAME CONTINUES.

1372
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,108
>> THANKS, JEFF.

1373
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,526
>> THANKS, JEFF.

1374
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:27,943
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1375
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,820
>> I DO FEEL LIKE WITH JULIE'S

1376
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,655
EARLY EXIT, IT WAS NOT ON OUR

1377
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,240
SIDE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO GET

1378
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:33,908
JEREMY OUT RIGHT THEN, AND THAT

1379
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,744
PLAN WAS SOLID, IT SEEMED LIKE.

1380
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,578
BUT JEREMY HOPEFULLY IS ON

1381
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,747
BORROWED TIME RIGHT NOW, AND I

1382
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,790
DON'T THINK HE EVEN REALIZED.

1383
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,292
I THINK HE THINKS REED OR MYSELF

1384
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,043
WOULD BE GONE TODAY, AND THERE

1385
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,003
WAS A 20% CHANCE OF THAT

1386
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:46,754
HAPPENING, BUT I THINK THERE WAS

1387
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,672
AN 80% CHANCE OF JEREMY LEAVING.

1388
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,716
>> YEAH, JULIE KIND OF MESSED IT

1389
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:50,883
UP.

1390
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:51,467
I WANTED JOSH OUT OF THE GAME.

1391
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,344
I FEEL LIKE IT BOTHERED ME MORE

1392
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,054
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

1393
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:55,763
I'M REALLY UPSET THAT SHE LEFT

1394
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,431
BECAUSE SHE REALLY MESSED UP MY

1395
00:41:57,514 --> 00:42:00,518
PLANS.

1396
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,610
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1397
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,986
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1398
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:15,449
>> Jeff:NEXT TIME ON

1399
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,326
"SURVIVOR":

1400
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:17,785
>> YOU WANT SOME FISH?

1401
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,702
I MEAN, THIS AIN'T NO CHARITY

1402
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:18,869
NOW.

1403
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,453
>> Jeff: IT'S THE I BATTLE OF

1404
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:25,542
THE SEXES AND IT HITS JON AND

1405
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,627
JACKLIN THE HARDEST.

1406
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:29,296
>> WHY.

1407
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,881
>> JON JUST DOESN'T CARE.

1408
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,049
>> JACLYN IS NOT ON THE SAME

1409
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:32,675
PAGE AS I AM.

1410
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,051
>> SOMEBODY IS NOT GOING TO BE

1411
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,135
HAPPY.

1412
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,475
>> THIS HAS BEEN MENTALLY

1413
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:42,101
EXHAUSTING AND I THINK I WILL

1414
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,436
HAVE TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF

1415
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,772
BACKLASH BUT I WAS THE ONE HERE

1416
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,774
I WAS THE ONE CLOSE TO

1417
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:52,736
DEHYDRATION.

1418
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,655
I WAS THE ONE MISSING MY LOVED

1419
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,572
ONES WITH NO COMMUNICATION FOR

1420
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,240
THREE WEEKS.

1421
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,533
ONLY I KNOW HOW TOUGH THIS WAS

1422
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,617
ON ME.
