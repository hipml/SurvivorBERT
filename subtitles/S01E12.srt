ANNOUNCER:
<i>16 Americans marooned</i>
<i>for 39 days</i>

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,214
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China Sea.</i>

3
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:10,093
<i>Separated into two tribes--</i>
<i>Tagi and Pagong,</i>

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,637
<i>they competed</i>
<i>against each other</i>

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,763
<i>to remain on the island.</i>

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,223
<i>But now the tribes</i>
<i>have merged into one.</i>

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>Rattana is the name,</i>

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,145
<i>and it is everyone</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>Every third night,</i>

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,231
<i>the entire tribe will hike</i>
<i>deep into the jungle</i>

11
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,109
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the Tribal Council,</i>

12
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,654
<i>where they must vote one</i>
<i>of their own off the island.</i>

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,906
<i>In the end, one will remain</i>

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,325
<i>and will leave the island</i>
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor:

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,377
<i>The Tagi alliance</i>
<i>threatened to crumble.</i>

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,006
RICHARD:
<i>It seems like Kelly might be</i>
<i>flip-flopping</i>

18
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,425
<i>and planning strategies</i>
<i>at our expense.</i>

19
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,551
SUSAN:
<i>When I turn around</i>
<i>and see somebody</i>

20
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,803
<i>starting to dig</i>
<i>a knife into my backside,</i>

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,305
it just really pisses me off.

22
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,100
JEFF:
<i>And island living was wearing</i>
<i>on the castaways.</i>

23
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,811
COLLEEN:
<i>It's not a fun game now.</i>

24
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,313
JEFF:
<i>Sean won a night</i>
<i>on a yacht</i>

25
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,566
<i>and a surprise visit</i>
<i>from his dad.</i>

26
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,984
Dad!

27
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,319
<i>Kelly found herself</i>
<i>in hot water.</i>

28
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,321
RICHARD:
<i>Kelly, on the other hand,</i>
<i>has no idea</i>

29
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,530
that she's leaving
this evening.

30
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,116
JEFF:
<i>But she saved herself</i>

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,201
<i>by winning</i>
<i>the immunity challenge.</i>

32
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,328
<i>Instead, Colleen paid the price</i>

33
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,205
<i>and was the final Pagong member</i>
<i>voted off.</i>

34
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,999
<i>Only five from the original</i>
<i>Tagi Tribe remain.</i>

35
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,293
<i>It's anyone's guess who will</i>
<i>be voted off tonight.</i>

00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,161
RICHARD:
Why are we leaving
Rattana, though?

38
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,246
That's the stupidest
thing I ever heard.

39
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,414
SUSAN:
You think that
Rattana played on?

40
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,415
Yeah.

41
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,958
RICHARD:
A bunch of individuals

42
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,042
playing a game.

43
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,294
Rattana was absolutely
meaningless.

44
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,461
SEAN:
Rattana was meaningless.

45
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,921
SUSAN:
Yeah, Rattana was
meaningless.

46
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,922
Tagi was... meant something.

47
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:53,923
RICHARD:
Our name.

48
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,008
Oh, yeah, especially

49
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,217
when we were up
against Pagong.

50
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,927
There's no such thing as...

51
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,888
for me, a Tagi Tribe
or a Rattana.

52
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,348
That was the stupidest thing
I ever heard.

53
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,892
Or... or any other tribe.

54
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,311
<i>It never existed</i>
<i>and it doesn't exist.</i>

55
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,563
<i>It's a group of 16 people,</i>

56
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,981
<i>four of whom were in</i>
<i>an alliance</i>

57
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,608
<i>with me</i>
<i>and a bunch of other ones.</i>

58
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,276
And it meant something.

59
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,736
Now it's five individuals

60
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,781
just playing a game
and hanging out.

61
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,532
That's good.

62
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,914
SEAN:
<i>Yeah, everyone's hunky-dory</i>
<i>and all friends,</i>

63
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:26,956
<i>but they all come to me</i>

64
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,958
<i>and they say bad things</i>
<i>about Richard,</i>

65
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:29,959
<i>or they say bad things</i>
<i>about Rudy,</i>

66
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:30,960
and then they go to Rudy

67
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,628
<i>and they say bad things</i>
<i>about me,</i>

68
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,005
<i>and they go to Rich,</i>

69
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,465
<i>they say bad things</i>
<i>about Rudy and I.</i>

70
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,343
Sean's just... you know,
talking to me all day about

71
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,971
making sure I convince
my man-- Rudy--

72
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,514
to vote for Sue.

73
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,601
If somebody gave me their word

74
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,646
that they are in this alliance
with me,

75
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,439
and I give my word,
my word is good,

76
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,984
and their word better be good.

77
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,987
If they betray me,
I'll get even with them.

78
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,989
Rudy talks about, "People
give me their word...

79
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,115
"I have friends.

80
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,991
"I have friends back at home

81
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,826
that take care
of people like that."

82
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,162
Oh, man.

83
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,956
I don't know
who I'm playing with here.

84
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,291
I'm, like, "Get me out of here.
Send me home."

85
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,084
Rudy's
something else.

86
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,336
RUDY:
<i>I mean, it's a game,</i>

87
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,505
but it's worth
a million dollars.

88
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,340
Money talks.

89
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,800
You've pretty much
got Rudy...

90
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:19,801
Yeah.

91
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,760
Under control.

92
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,804
He always just looks
to me and goes...

93
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,013
He goes,
"Hey, who?"

94
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,556
I don't care.
Don't worry about it.

95
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,726
You have my word
and I gave it to you...

96
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,646
Rich is a smart guy
and he's really tricky,

97
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,523
and, uh, I don't trust him
one bit.

98
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,024
I never really have.

99
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,820
Whatever it takes to win here
is the point.

100
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,571
It's a game, and call it
Machiavellian, sure.

101
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,490
I'd much rather
it be Rudy left.

102
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,909
Than Sue.

103
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,203
'Cause then you and I are,
you know, definitely...

104
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,538
going
to the top.

105
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,540
So Kelly goes next.

106
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,543
So it will now be
you, Sean, me and Sue.

107
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,255
I don't think you're any
better off against anybody else.

108
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,049
In other words, getting there
with anybody but me.

109
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,051
Hopefully, it
will be us three.

110
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,678
SEAN:
<i>This is the most</i>

111
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,888
<i>conniving bunch of people</i>
<i>I've ever met in my life.</i>

112
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,933
<i>There's not an honest one</i>
<i>in the bunch.</i>

113
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,060
<i>Conniving, conniving,</i>
<i>conniving.</i>

114
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:16,024
Things are falling apart here

115
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,025
at Rattana Beach.

116
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,276
(<i> voices arguing</i> )

117
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,862
You told them you
weren't aligned with us.

118
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,238
Colleen told me that.

119
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,906
That's bull (<i> blip</i> ).

120
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,199
I don't give a (<i> blip</i> ),

121
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,868
because I trust her
more than I trust you.

122
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,161
Why? That's bull (<i> blip</i> ).

123
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,787
I've been your friend
since day one.

124
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,830
No. I'm going fishing.

125
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,248
That's bull (<i> blip</i> ).

126
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:32,749
Will you talk to me?

127
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,876
No. I don't have to.

128
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,976
What did you
just ask Sue?

129
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,644
Sue feels that

130
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,896
I (<i> blip</i> ) her...

131
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,772
or have (<i> blip</i> )
the four of us...

132
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,565
I don't understand
what that's coming from.

133
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,650
Because... because I tried
to make the Pagong team think

134
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,904
that we weren't going
to eliminate them one by one?

135
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,781
I thought that
was part of the game.

136
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,617
SUSAN:
<i>Kelly made all the rest of us</i>
<i>look like a bunch of idiots.</i>

137
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,120
Then she made all the rest of us
look like the bad guys

138
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,415
and her the one good guy
out of the whole five of us.

139
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,666
That's what irritated me.

140
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,126
Sue doesn't have
all the facts.

141
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,294
Uh-huh.

142
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,128
I was trying to pretend

143
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,838
that we weren't going
to eliminate

144
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:21,798
them one by one,
as I've said before,

145
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,133
and I thought that was
part of the plan.

146
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,301
We had said
when they come,

147
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,094
we're going
to split up,

148
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,096
we're going to hang
out with them.

149
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:28,805
I wasn't trying to work them
for myself at all.

150
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,973
They all wanted to vote you off.

151
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,433
They tried to come to me
and say,

152
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,476
"Hey, we can be in the majority.
We can vote Rich off."

153
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,602
I didn't.

154
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,146
I know.
I think it was a smart decision.

155
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,273
Sue said many times that
she wasn't part

156
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,650
of an alliance either.

157
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,485
So, now all of a sudden
I'm two-faced and I (<i> blip</i> ) her

158
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,987
when she had approached me
and said,

159
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,697
"Hey, Rich and I have formed
an alliance

160
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,116
"to vote you off at the end,

161
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:48,825
"but I'm not going to do that.

162
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,993
Let's you and I vote him off."

163
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,829
If I was trying
to plot against you

164
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,288
and plot against Sue...

165
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,289
Uh-huh.

166
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,999
...and trying to use them
in my best interests,

167
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:57,834
then I would have
voted for you.

168
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,794
Yeah, I don't think
that's true.d...

169
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,629
...I wanted to stay true
to our... to our alliance--

170
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,672
to our four that
we decided on from
the beginning.

171
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,174
Right. Right.

172
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,552
When Kelly said to me, um,
"Are you pissed off at me?

173
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,721
It seems to me like you
and Sue are pissed off at me."

174
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,016
<i>Well, that was my opportunity</i>
<i>to come in</i>

175
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,018
and smooth things,

176
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,355
as opposed to be the one
who upsets the applecart.

177
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:20,606
Thanks, Kells Bells.

178
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,360
<i>So certainly that little tiff</i>
<i>between Kelly and Sue</i>

179
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,695
<i>has been coming</i>

180
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,322
and plays to my advantage,
absolutely.

181
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,227
Aw, it hurts.

182
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,688
This is my second ray sting
since I've been here.

183
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,273
Oh, and trust me, they hurt.

184
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,733
<i>It's like an aching sting</i>

185
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,569
and it hurts from my knuckle
down to about here,

186
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,238
and it's constantly pounding
and it aches

187
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,698
and it hurts really bad.

188
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,369
I might act like a tough girl,
but they do hurt.

189
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,370
They gouge me.

190
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,747
This one got me good.

191
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,457
Notice the hand.

192
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,544
The knuckles are still swollen
from that ray bite.

193
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,380
I seen that tail come in
and just slice that.

194
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,423
Ow, was I pissed.

195
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,424
Cause he was
in a little hole.

196
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,592
He couldn't go
anywhere but out.

197
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,302
You know, he couldn't
go back or forward.

198
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,887
He had
to come out.

199
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,556
KELLY:
At least you get
to eat the bastard.

200
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,784
RICHARD:
<i>Sixth day to the end.</i>

201
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,328
<i>Desperate to go home.</i>

202
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,789
<i>Really looking forward</i>
<i>to enter reality.</i>

203
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:04,919
For me, this maintaining some
kind of a thumb

204
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,796
on ev... all of these different
people's personalities

205
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,300
<i>that I care very little about,</i>
<i>uh, is exhausting.</i>

206
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,135
<i>I'm ready for the people</i>

207
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,762
<i>in my life that I've brought</i>
<i>into my life,</i>

208
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,931
<i>throughout my life.</i>

209
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,641
And I'm looking forward
to getting back to that

210
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,850
with a vengeance.

211
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,020
SEAN:
<i>I've been wishing for home</i>

212
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,522
since the day I got here.

213
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,816
I haven't been away from
New York in this long ever.

214
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,484
<i>I miss my favorite restaurant.</i>

215
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,485
<i>I miss the people</i>
<i>at the restaurant.</i>

216
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,111
<i>I miss my friends.</i>

217
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,154
<i>I miss my family.</i>

218
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:32,780
<i>You know, I miss</i>
<i>all those things.</i>

219
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,824
I'm just looking forward

220
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,992
to talking to my husband
on the phone.

221
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,285
I can't wait for that.

222
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,161
I get anywhere
within a phone
to make a call,

223
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,997
that's what I'm doing,
is calling home.

224
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,707
I don't give a (<i> blip</i> )
what time of day it is there.

225
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,340
RICHARD:
<i>The end of days</i>

226
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,468
<i>is what I'm thinking about</i>
<i>as I lay here on a raft</i>

227
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,680
<i>in the middle of the</i>
<i>South China Sea on a beach--</i>

228
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,557
<i>in my bed.</i>

229
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,771
<i>Yeah, it's very pretty.</i>

230
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,315
<i>It's a beautiful,</i>
<i>beautiful night.</i>

231
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,692
<i>Cloudy, but I like the clouds.</i>

232
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,819
I'm just looking at the clouds,

233
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,903
thinking of going home.

234
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,864
Waiting...

235
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,241
<i>waiting...</i>

236
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,284
<i>with no watch.</i>

237
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,244
<i>Having no idea what time it is.</i>

238
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,831
<i>Just knowing that time</i>
<i>is passing slowly.</i>

239
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,570
Oh.

240
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,738
(<i> laughing</i> )

241
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,739
"Dig in."

242
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,574
"Dig in."

243
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,825
That's mud from
the mud volcano.

244
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,869
We got to dig in

245
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,579
to find the clue?

246
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,789
Yeah.

247
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,415
All it is is swamp mud.

248
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,417
I'm going
to rinse my hand off.

249
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:08,876
I think that's cool.

250
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,877
What?

251
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,254
The bucket and the mud.

252
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,882
We're going to have
to do some kind of digging.

253
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,226
Oh, I found it.

254
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,269
Oh, cool! Read it.

255
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,270
Read it to me.

256
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,480
What's it say, Rudy?

257
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,815
"It might
be a dirty job,

258
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,858
<i>"but now it's up to you.</i>

259
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,236
<i>Make like a hog</i>
<i>at the volcano..."</i>

260
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:35,945
"carry mud..."

261
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,448
ALL:
"for an ice-cold brew."

262
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,618
Another trip out
of here would be nice.

263
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,078
That's good news.

264
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,496
It is.

265
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,627
JEFF:
It's Day 35 on the island

266
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,881
and old friends
are becoming new enemies.

267
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,925
<i>So, for today's</i>
<i>reward challenge,</i>

268
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,678
<i>the tribe members will head</i>
<i>to the mud volcano</i>

269
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,639
<i>and, perhaps,</i>
<i>calm things down a little.</i>

270
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,268
<i>This mud volcano actually</i>
<i>created the entire island.</i>

271
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,812
<i>Today,</i>
<i>the tribe members will engage</i>

272
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,106
<i>in some therapeutic</i>
<i>mud bathing.</i>

273
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,190
Okay, here's
what I know.

274
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:18,195
A bit of a blowout yesterday,
shouldn't be unexpected,

275
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,992
so the idea today is to have
a different kind of a blowout.

276
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,993
The goal is pretty simple:

277
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,371
get as much mud
from the mud volcano

278
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,833
into your bucket
as you can in five minutes,

279
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,086
using your body
as the transport vehicle.

280
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,589
So you go over and lather up
as much as you can.

281
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,341
You come back over here,
shake off, squeeze out--

282
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,843
whatever you want.

283
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,344
If that doesn't
take the tension off,

284
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,847
nothing
takes the edge off

285
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,016
like a cold beer, right?

286
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,934
So, for the winner,

287
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,312
one Bud Light.

288
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,689
That's a warm-up for
what's going to happen later.

289
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,566
Because,
for the winner, later,

290
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,735
you're going to be picked up,

291
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,029
blindfolded,
boated to a mysterious bar,

292
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,782
where you and I are going
to have a few more Bud Lights.

293
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,410
We're going to watch
the first five minutes

294
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,703
of episode one...

295
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,704
Wow!

296
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,039
...of<i> Survivor.</i>

297
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,040
Wow!

298
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,625
I lCool?hat.

299
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,043
SUSAN:
That works for me.

300
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,045
Okay, I'm going
to set my beer aside.

301
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,671
Let's get ready
to do this thing.

302
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,343
Survivors ready...

303
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,594
Get muddy!

304
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,058
(<i> whooping</i> )

305
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,939
(<i> laughing</i> )

306
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,131
(<i> squishing</i> )

307
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,670
Looking good, Rudy!

308
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,092
Ten seconds!

309
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,018
Five...

310
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,144
four...

311
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,186
three...

312
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,146
two...

313
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,316
Stop! Stop,
stop, stop.

314
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:00,983
That was fun.

315
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,652
That was a blast.

316
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,403
This is going to be close.

317
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,947
All right,
we'll start on the end.

318
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,157
Man!

319
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,076
Don't you have
to move over?

320
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,162
SUSAN:
Stop bouncing.

321
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,163
Oh, this is going
to be so close.

322
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:18,167
15.9 for Kelly.

323
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,210
That's not
bad at all.

324
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,006
Yeah, Rudy, I don't
think you're as heavy.

325
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,007
No.

326
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,343
No, that's not
going to do it.

327
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,886
Right at about ten.

328
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,179
Need a little
more coverage.

329
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,349
Susan, you've
got a big bucket.

330
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,350
25 pounds.

331
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,851
15.9 is the number.

332
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,272
15.

333
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,150
No. Aw, they get the heavy mud.

334
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,152
15.9 is the number
to beat.

335
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,863
This is Sean.

336
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,156
Who's ahead?

337
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,366
SEAN:
Sean-- 16.

338
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,660
Sean was
using his hair.

339
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,705
Not going
to be enough.

340
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,164
SUSAN:
Wow, Kelly.

341
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,209
Wow!

342
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,670
One guy left.

343
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,505
15.9. I don't think

344
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,048
it's going to be enough.

345
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,758
It looks like it's too easy
for you to carry.

346
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,593
I think I'm having
a beer with Kelly.

347
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,844
Oh, you're out.

348
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,303
It's not even close.

349
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,262
Wow!

350
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,556
Yeah!

351
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,557
Give you a big hug.

352
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,225
Give me a big hug.

353
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,211
I wish I had a bigger chest
to carry the mud.

354
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,255
I've been muddy,
but not this kind.

355
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,297
It feels good to,
you know, win something.

356
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,174
I haven't won much of anything,

357
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,761
but I won yesterday
and I won today.

358
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,305
I'd feel better if it was
an immunity that I won today,

359
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,266
but, hopefully,
I'm on a winning streak.

360
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,451
<i>Everybody was very pissy</i>
<i>prior to the mud bath,</i>

361
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,827
myself included.

362
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,162
Things really
changed here today.

363
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,913
<i>There was a fight,</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

364
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,999
<i>between Kelly and Sue, but,</i>
<i>truthfully,</i>

365
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,250
<i>this little shenanigan game</i>

366
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,420
<i>at the mud bath thing</i>
<i>really paid off, I think.</i>

367
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,464
<i>And it did-- it rejuvenated us.</i>

368
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,133
<i>I think it rekindled, you know,</i>
<i>just, like, friendships</i>

369
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,926
<i>and laughing,</i>
<i>and things like that.</i>

370
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,013
SUSAN:
Yeah, the mud game
was a blast.

371
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,141
I had a blast. Fun--
totally a lot of fun.

372
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,350
When we got back from the mud,
we were washing...

373
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,352
helping each other
get the mud off

374
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,812
<i>and things like that.</i>

375
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,981
Let me clean my ears out,
then you take it.

376
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,525
RICHARD:
It's bizarre to me

377
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,652
how people do the things
they do--

378
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,154
like how Sue and Kelly

379
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,989
<i>are washing each other's back</i>
<i>and hair</i>

380
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,158
<i>and, you know, laughing, joking</i>

381
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,993
<i>and hugging,</i>
<i>and picking each other's zits</i>

382
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,203
<i>and all the rest of it</i>

383
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,496
<i>right now, after what</i>

384
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,331
<i>they went through yesterday.</i>

385
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,501
SUSAN:
Doing the mud thing really wore

386
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,127
a lot of energy out of us,

387
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,837
so it did key us down
quite a bit.

388
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,299
<i>And Kelly's the only other girl</i>
<i>on the island with me,</i>

389
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,219
<i>so we're going</i>
<i>to hang together to the end.</i>

390
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,023
This is my big
getting-ready moment.

391
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,775
I do, I hear the boat.

392
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,527
Here he comes--

393
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,361
the wondrous one.

394
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,988
Bigger boat, girl.

395
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,283
They brought your limo
to pick you up.

396
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,661
Have fun on your
night out, kiddo.

397
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,329
Have fun.
I hope there's...

398
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,081
Have a good one, kid.

399
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,249
See you later.

400
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,802
Bye, you guys.

401
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,596
See you later.

402
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,279
Now I'm going
to take you this way.

403
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,239
Hear that.

404
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,408
Oh, a bar.

405
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,285
There's cigarettes
if you're so inclined.

406
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,453
Can I get food, too?

407
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,080
And food, yes.

408
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:25,789
Okay, hold on.

409
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,416
Let me pull
your chair out.

410
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,585
Oh, a chair...
Look at you!

411
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,086
Okay, right over
here, actually.

412
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,462
Now sit down.
If you feel

413
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,883
like you're getting looks,
that's because there aren't...

414
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,259
More Americans blindfolded.

415
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,594
Typical.

416
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,095
This looks normal.

417
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:40,345
Uh-huh.

418
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,517
Okay, want a beer?

419
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,311
Yes.

420
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,563
Can we get two Buds?

421
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,481
Thanks.

422
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,442
Yay!

423
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,735
Right on.

424
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,278
Thank you,
thank you.

425
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,364
All right, let's toast.

426
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,450
That's
good stuff.

427
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,201
This Bud's for you.

428
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,328
Oh, thank you.

429
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,621
Cheers.

430
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,872
Cheers.

431
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,372
Aah!

432
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,626
Oh, my God.

433
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,294
Thank you.

434
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,171
Look at this huge plate.

435
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,964
Let me get that salt.

436
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,799
So how you hanging in?

437
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,342
I'm doing good.

438
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,469
Yeah?

439
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,721
Yeah, the game's,
um... you know,

440
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,430
finally
gotten weird.

441
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,849
It's finally
gotten crazy.

442
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,516
Finally
gotten intense.

443
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,769
Really?

444
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,978
I thought
I could trust Sue,

445
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,271
which was
my first mistake.

446
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,356
I guess you can't
trust anybody.

447
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,358
I don't lose any
respect for her

448
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,985
for playing the game at all.

449
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,819
We're not... you know,

450
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,489
I said something today
on the trail...

451
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,033
I was, like, wait a minute--
we're not evil.

452
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,993
We just play bad people on TV.

453
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,828
Whether it's every
man for himself

454
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,164
or whatever, I would like to,
uh...

455
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,832
smooth things over with Sue,

456
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,502
because that was just
completely... there was no...

457
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,839
It'll be interesting
to see how this plays out.

458
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,465
I know.

459
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,479
JEFF:
I have a very special friend

460
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,857
<i>that I was going to show her</i>
<i>something on the TV.</i>

461
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,566
<i>Is that okay?</i>

462
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,819
Yeah.

463
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,363
(<i> patrons applauding</i> )

464
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,407
All right.

465
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,618
(<i> patrons cheering</i> )

466
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,414
How many do I need?

467
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,207
Where's our box?

468
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,375
Where's the Tagi box?

469
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,502
JEFF:
You are witnessing

470
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:40,007
16 Americans begin
an adventure that will forever

471
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,216
change their lives.

472
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,426
They've been given two minutes

473
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,719
to salvage whatever they can

474
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,013
off this boat.

475
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,681
Yeah, go, Jenna!

476
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,266
That was awesome.

477
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,892
That was so cool.

478
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,603
The Tagi Tribe,
who will always wear orange,

479
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,606
consists of Rudy Boesch,
a retired Navy SEAL,

480
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,984
and Kelly Wiglesworth,

481
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,236
a river guide from Las Vegas...

483
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,992
Oh, my God!

484
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,417
Good night.

485
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,002
I'll see you later.

486
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,275

Today is the fourth day

487
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,278
<i>till the end of competition--</i>

488
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,113
<i>the 36th day of our game.</i>

489
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,948
<i>I've said it 14 times today</i>

490
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,117
<i>and I still can't keep it</i>
<i>in my head.</i>

491
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,452
Let's keep it
fun around here

492
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,953
for the next,
you know...

493
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,954
Yeah.it fun?

494
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:53,955
It's going

495
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,623
to be tough,
emotion-wise

496
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,917
between Sue and Kelly.

497
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,127
And Kelly, I think,
is going to be

498
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,504
a little sadder.

499
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,589
She's sitting over
there with her,
so that's good.

500
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,633
I'm waiting
to manage conflict.

501
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,801
Well, you got one.

502
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,178
I've come
to a conclusion.

503
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:12,099
I align with my family,
who I love dearly and...

504
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,726
There is four days left,
and we're all going to have
to live together.

505
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,978
<i>And Sue and I,</i>
<i>we kind of patched things up</i>

506
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,231
<i>and she said,</i>
<i>"Hey, look, this is a game.</i>

507
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,358
<i>"I'm going to have</i>
<i>an alliance with Rich</i>

508
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,526
<i>instead of you."</i>

509
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,652
<i>I said, "Fine. That's cool.</i>
<i>Play the game."</i>

510
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,571
If you feel that
you need to
align with Rich

511
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,989
to get you
as far as you can...

512
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,366
That's what I'm saying.

513
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,159
And you're
playing the game

514
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,161
and, you know,
I respect that,

515
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,704
but I didn't,
you know,

516
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,331
you were telling me
I was two-faced

517
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,541
and telling me
that I, you know,

518
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,167
betrayed you
or whatever

519
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,502
and I don't feel
that I have at all.

520
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,712
<i>I said, "I think I deserve</i>
<i>to get to the four</i>

521
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,381
<i>and to get to the three."</i>

522
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,133
<i>She said,</i>
<i>"I'm not going to let you."</i>

523
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,509
<i>And it's the other way around--</i>
<i>I'm not going to let her.</i>

524
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,636
I feel that I
should maybe

525
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,346
deserve to get
into the three

526
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,264
and then you guys
have at it.

527
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,683
Well, whatever, yeah,
but, no, I ain't going

528
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,976
to let you
into the three

529
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,227
if I can
possibly help it,

530
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,062
'cause you're a threat
to me in the end.

531
00:23:59,146 --> 00:23:59,813
We'll keep to an agreement

532
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,524
that we'll treat
each other civil

533
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,192
till the time we leave here.

534
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,236
No sense to make it hard
on anybody.

535
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,406
And while we're here,
possibly together for
the next four days...

536
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,073
so let's
just be civil.

537
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,825
I know. That's
what I thought

538
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,076
we were being--
very civil.

539
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,703
I thought
we were, too.

540
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,872
I just wanted to...
to clear that up.

541
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,875
I felt that yesterday
was a confusing thing

542
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,878
and, you know,
whatever happens now, happens.

543
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,628
That's right. Yeah.

544
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,513
RICHARD:
Check that out.

545
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,598
Look at the road

546
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,933
the ant highway,
up on the, uh, ceiling

547
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,518
of the, uh, hut here.

548
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,060
The canvas.

549
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,021
Two-lane highway.

550
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:41,897
You can see the ants
going in and out.

551
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,733
Got a really
great view from here.

552
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,693
We'll build the grill
when we get back.

553
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,446
This is my
mosquito net sarong.

554
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,030
This is... damn it.

555
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,740
Really it's three days.

556
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,744
Right, this is the
fourth day to the end.

557
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,704
In three days, this'll be over.

558
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,040
All I'm thinking now is "win."

559
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:00,749
Do what I have to do.

560
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,584
Now I'm in it to win, you know,

561
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,087
and to just... just
be a nice guy

562
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,756
and to just do this,
that and the other thing

563
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,924
and pack it in is wrong.

564
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,967
<i>So I got to win.</i>

565
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,594
I'm going to have
to win immunity

566
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,720
and I'll have to finagle.

567
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,971
<i>And I'm</i>
<i>going to have to try</i>

568
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,473
<i>to pick up the vibe on people.</i>

569
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,849
<i>If, you know, like right now,</i>

570
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,559
<i>Sue and Kelly</i>
<i>aren't getting along.</i>

571
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,770
<i>There might be something</i>
<i>I can exploit to my advantage.</i>

572
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,772
I might have to do
stuff like that.

573
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,108
It's going to be a lot of work,
but I'll get there.

574
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,777
SUSAN:
<i>Yeah, I have one more</i>
<i>challenge.</i>

575
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,613
There's no rewards,
and you know what?

576
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,989
I'm not even thinking
I'm going to win anymore.

577
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,284
<i>I want to win the last one,</i>
<i>like, oh, man, if I win any--</i>

578
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,327
<i>I'm praying, I'm praying</i>

579
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,204
<i>that I win</i>
<i>the very last immunity--</i>

580
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,623
<i>if I'm here, if I make it</i>
<i>through the next four,</i>

581
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,457
<i>which I think I will.</i>

582
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,627
Oh, the mailbox
is getting further away.

583
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,295
There it is.

584
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,755
SUSAN:
A camera.

585
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,840
"Last night, Jeff Probst
went missing."

586
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,134
"Last night..."

587
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,179
"his camera was all that
was found in the jungle."

588
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,974
All right, how do you
work the damn thing?

589
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,642
So who knows how
to play these back?

590
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,978
It says "play."

591
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,729
KELLY:
Okay. What the hell's going on?

592
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,655
Who saw the silly

593
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,657
<i>Blair Witch</i>
<i>Project</i> anyway?

594
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,993
SUSAN:
I did. So watch.

595
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,619
This will tell us
where he's at.

596
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,830
This is... wherever
he's marked in the jungle.

597
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,623
Oh, look at the mask.

598
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,960
"What is the
immunity challenge?"

599
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,422
<i>Survivor Witch Project.</i>

600
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,840
Pagong Beach.

601
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,300
Sundown.

602
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,928
What was that? What was that?

603
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,013
What was that?

604
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,181
"Pagong Beach at sundown."

605
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,475
And "What is the
immunity challenge?"

606
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,351
We get no clues.

607
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,687
It's tonight at Pagong
Beach at sundown.

608
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,314
That's pretty
cool, though.

609
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,867
JEFF:
<i>This island is Rich with</i>
<i>tradition and superstition.</i>

610
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,495
<i>Talk to the locals,</i>
<i>they'll tell you one thing--</i>

611
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,206
<i>disrespect the jungle,</i>
<i>you pay the price.</i>

612
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,751
Today's challenge deals
with jungle spirits.

613
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,503
Each survivor will be
given a video camera

614
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,381
<i>and will race into the jungle</i>
<i>in search of five masks.</i>

615
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,509
<i>Behind each one is a question</i>
<i>about island folklore.</i>

616
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,178
<i>The castaways</i>
<i>will use the camera</i>

617
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>to record themselves giving the</i>
<i>answers and then take the mask.</i>

618
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,975
<i>The first one</i>
<i>to collect all the masks</i>

619
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,354
<i>and answer all five</i>
<i>questions correctly on tape</i>

620
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,190
<i>will appease the jungle spirits</i>
<i>and win immunity.</i>

621
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,028
Everything I'm about
to tell you is true.

622
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,739
Malaysian custom says
that sacrificing a goat

623
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,407
can bring about good luck.

624
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,450
<i>So the locals seek out</i>

625
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,744
<i>the largest Banyan tree</i>
<i>they can find</i>

626
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,039
and a high priestess
makes the sacrifice.

627
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,960
This is how you protect
yourself in the jungle.

628
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,754
The one thing you want to do
to protect yourself is

629
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,381
never call out
somebody's name.

630
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,382
According to legend,

631
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,759
if you call out someone's name,
the tree spirits

632
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,969
Ncan grab that name and
literally<i> repeat that name</i>
<i>later.</i>

633
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,597
<i>So you're out on your own</i>

634
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,350
<i>and you hear somebody say</i>
<i>your name-- "I'm over here."</i>

635
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,935
<i>So you start going this way.</i>

636
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,645
So what you have to do
if this happens--

637
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,231
you got a piece of vine,
you make a circle out of it,

638
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,732
you step through the circle,

639
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,025
you say
your own name

640
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,194
and you reclaim
your name.

641
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,034
<i>Every Tribal Council</i>
<i>I say, "Fire represents life.</i>

642
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,787
<i>Your identity is</i>
<i>represented by your fire."</i>

643
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,915
Since the merger, every person
voted off the island

644
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,918
has had their torch mysteriously
blown out by the wind.

645
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,795
And without anyone noticing,

646
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:37,173
we had to re-light it
so it could be

647
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,842
ceremoniously
snuffed out instead.

648
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,971
Also at Tribal Council,

649
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,806
I started blowing
this conch shell.

650
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,058
Okay. Folklore says
that the headhunters,
when they would

651
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,436
come back from
their headhunting,

652
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,020
<i>they would blow the conch shell</i>

653
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,981
<i>and the rain gods</i>
<i>would release a storm</i>

654
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,441
<i>to cleanse them</i>
<i>of all their sins</i>

655
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,444
that they had committed for the
people that they had beheaded.

656
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,446
What has happened
at every Tribal Council?

657
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,947
It's rained.

658
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:06,494
The last thing is probably
the most beautiful thing

659
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,329
about island life,
involves snakes.

660
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,956
The truth is
that when a snake

661
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,834
comes to your camp, it is
actually bringing you good luck.

662
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,794
If you treat the snake
with respect,

663
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,130
it<i> will</i> bring you good luck,
but if you disrespect

664
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,008
or taunt a snake,
it'll bring you bad luck.

665
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,010
Joel can
attest to that.

666
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,180
<i>He chased a pit viper</i>
<i>away from the Pagong camp,</i>

667
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,306
<i>his fate was sealed.</i>

668
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,307
<i>Later that night</i>

669
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,099
<i>Joel was voted off the island.</i>

670
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,894
The most important
thing right now is

671
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,020
if you have listened
carefully,

672
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,897
I've given you everything
you need to know

673
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,816
to win tonight's
immunity challenge.

674
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,901
Take a camera

675
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,320
and pass it down.

676
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,030
Your immunity challenge
tonight is to go into the jungle

677
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,990
and there
you'll find

678
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,867
five masks
for each one of you.

679
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,868
Behind each mask
is a question.

680
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,995
Take the video camera,
point it at yourself,

681
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,498
record the answer.

682
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,082
When you're finished,
take the mask with you.

683
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:57,003
First one back with all the
correct answers wins immunity.

684
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,546
Let's do it.

685
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,220
This is for immunity.

686
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,389
Win this, you're going
to the final four.

687
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,060
Survivors ready?

688
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,353
Go!

689
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,741
"What is one event..."

690
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,999
Their torches going out
at, uh, the council.

691
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:42,966
"How can you turn the good luck
from a visiting snake
into bad luck?"

692
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:43,967
Don't bother it, don't taunt it.

693
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,594
Not taunting it or anything.

694
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,180
Don't taunt it, don't do
anything to it. That's one.

695
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,441
I don't know.

696
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:05,780
"What will the sprits do
when they hear the conch shell?"

697
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:08,950
They'll cause it to rain
to cleanse the, uh...

698
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,994
sins of the headhunters.

699
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,507
Okay.

700
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,598
Uh... say your name

701
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,182
and step
through a hoop in vines.

702
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,312
Say your name
and it will be all cleared up.

703
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,488
"...from Tribal Council?"

704
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,948
I don't know.

705
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,337
"According to legend,
what must you do

706
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,797
to respect the spirits
in the Banyan tree?"

707
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:05,798
Kill a goat.

708
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,342
Drain the blood from the goat.

709
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,969
And then pour the blood
around in a circle.

710
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,895
"If the spirits cause you to..."

711
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,237
I don't know.

712
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,495
Five?

713
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,996
Yeah.

714
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,337
Do you have
all the answers?

715
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,505
Sure do.

716
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,006
Yeah?
Let me see it.

717
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,636
Four for four.

718
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,013
Last one.

719
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,685
I guess you get
to keep this.

720
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,894
There you go.

721
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:00,395
SUSAN:
Good job, Kelly.

722
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,229
Nice job, Wiglesworth.

723
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,189
Congratulations.

724
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,190
Thanks, guys.

725
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,939
SUSAN:
<i>The rain's coming sideways.</i>

726
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,566
If it was coming straight down,

727
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,651
we'd be over by the fire
underneath the parachute.

728
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,738
That would be good
over there, eh, Rudy?

729
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,115
RUDY:
Yeah. Parachute might blow away.

730
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,576
SUSAN:
I hope it's just
an afternoon of this, Rudy.

731
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,410
I hope it's not
raining tonight

732
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,454
when we got to march
up to tribal.

733
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,999
I don't know how Sean
could sit up there.

734
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,959
Thought he had enough of it.

735
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:05,501
Cold and hungry.

736
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,628
I'm winning this thing.

737
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,464
You know, it's going to be
an uphill battle for me,

738
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,299
but I'm winning this thing--
the whole show.

739
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,142
RICHARD:
<i>So we're back to...</i>
<i>where we were, eh?</i>

740
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,143
We were just talking

741
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,772
about whether
it's Sean or Rudy.

742
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,691
RUDY:
<i>Myself and, uh, Rich</i>

743
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,359
are going right to the end.

744
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:35,114
You know, we hope that
it will be us two in the end

745
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,657
where the jury picks one of us.

746
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,826
Yeah. It should be
an interesting council.

747
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,994
Mm-hmm.

748
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:41,496
RICHARD:
<i>The balance of power</i>

749
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,790
<i>I don't believe has shifted</i>
<i>from me to Kelly,</i>

750
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,167
<i>but certainly I've lost</i>
<i>some footing.</i>

751
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,796
Kelly wins immunity,
and all kinds of things

752
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,547
have to change
and shift quickly.

753
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:55,051
<i>So it's not as easy</i>
<i>to remain a solid alliance</i>

754
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,054
<i>in the midst of a lot of flux</i>

755
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,305
<i>with so few people.</i>

756
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,307
KELLY:
<i>Rich has said--</i>

757
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,975
since he knows
that Sue was plotting

758
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,018
an alliance against him--

759
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:07,814
<i>he has had to rearrange</i>
<i>his strategy.</i>

760
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,732
<i>So, maybe they're not</i>
<i>voting together.</i>

761
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,442
<i>I don't know.</i>

762
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,486
To me, that just means game on.

763
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,673
SEAN:
<i>I think I've always</i>
<i>looked at it,</i>

764
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,258
<i>the next Tribal Council,</i>

765
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,718
<i>there'll be, you know,</i>
<i>a lot of votes cast</i>

766
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,636
in different directions

767
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,888
that were never previously
cast before.

768
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,684
<i>I think the three people</i>
<i>that are likely to vote for Sue</i>

769
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,352
<i>are me, Richard</i>
<i>and potentially Rudy.</i>

770
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,397
<i>Rudy's kind of swinging.</i>

771
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,357
Rudy wants to...
wanted me whacked

772
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,109
about three weeks ago,

773
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,443
<i>so, you know...</i>
<i>he's a good guy.</i>

774
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,320
<i>We sleep together, but he's</i>
<i>ready to slit my throat</i>

775
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:00,199
<i>in this contest any minute now.</i>

776
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,245
Behind...

777
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,122
KELLY:
<i>I'm going to vote</i>
<i>for either Rich or Sue.</i>

778
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,958
Um... it's time to get dirty.

779
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,251
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

780
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,712
<i>I... as I said, I don't know.</i>

781
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,047
<i>It's every man for himself.</i>

782
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,131
JEFF:
Grab a seat.

783
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,925
I'll bring in the jury...

784
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,760
which is growing.

785
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,638
Now, Greg, Jenna,

786
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,432
Gervase, Colleen.

787
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,643
They'll take a seat
here to observe.

788
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,479
One of you will be
joining this group tonight.

789
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,147
The other four
will be moving on.

790
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,815
Tribal Council number 12.

791
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,318
This is big tonight,

792
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,278
because if you make it
through this vote,

793
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,821
you make it
to the final four.

794
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,658
Obviously the only person
here doesn't have
to worry tonight--

795
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,700
Kelly Wiglesworth.

796
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:28,704
Kelly, how much did you need
to win that immunity?

797
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,165
Desperately. Desperately.

798
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,959
You're convinced you
were gone if not?

799
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:33,876
Pretty much, yeah.

800
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,753
In the situation
we're in tonight,

801
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,171
as a result,
you go from somebody

802
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,547
who might well have
been voted off

803
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,548
to the absolute
swing vote.

804
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,676
You can't be voted on,

805
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,011
but you're going
to vote for somebody.

806
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,137
Indeed.

807
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,848
Did the mood around you
change at all in the last day?

808
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,891
I'd say so, yeah.

809
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,185
I think the mood, you know...

810
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,478
pretty much everybody
with the whole group

811
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,314
and the new dynamics

812
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:59,986
and three days left
has changed quite a bit.

813
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,279
JEFF:
What about you, Rich?

814
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,698
What do you think
the take is on you

815
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,741
from the American public
point of view.

816
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,702
Hopefully, the people
who watch the show

817
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,413
would see somebody who's kind
of known what he was looking for

818
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,498
from the beginning,
and has kind of

819
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,668
worked toward
his goal

820
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,169
as ethically as he
could do it.

821
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,005
JEFF:
Rudy, you been
around a long time.

822
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,423
You're definitely the veteran
of this group.

823
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,925
You're flying low

824
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,301
under the radar.

825
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,219
What do you think

826
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,512
people are saying about
you at this point?

827
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,682
Well, I know the whole
Atlantic fleet is saying

828
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,393
"What's that old son of a...
doing in there?"

829
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,561
You know, and, uh,

830
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,480
I'll have to answer 'em
when I get back.

831
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,398
Do you think your buddies
are going, "Go, Rudy!"

832
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,900
Or, "I can't wait to see
this guy...?"

833
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,862
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They're behind me.

834
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,071
They'd better be.

835
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,740
Even after you said
you liked the homo?

836
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,949
Huh?

837
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,075
That's a good
question, though.

838
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,452
You've made a couple of jokes,
you know, that Rich

839
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,579
is definitely
a friend,

840
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,414
but you wouldn't want
to be seen with him

841
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,874
around your buddies.

842
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,792
When we're done with this,
I'm going to shake his hand

843
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,377
and hope I never see you again.

844
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,420
That's it.

845
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,588
Is there a sense of dread

846
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,798
coming over
you guys

847
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,717
that, you know,
this whole idea

848
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,802
of the alliance now
has to be reckoned with?

849
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,595
Actions come into play.

850
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,596
At one point,

851
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,265
whether it was
happenstance or not,

852
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,100
Pagong members were
voted off one by one.

853
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,102
Now they're sitting
across from you

854
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,562
ready to say,
"Now it's my turn."

855
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,731
How's that sittin'
with you, Sean?

856
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,274
It's sitting fine with me.

857
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:22,234
I think the people
that got to know me,

858
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,402
got to understand me

859
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,737
and know where
I'm coming from...

860
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,654
But, you know,
like I said

861
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,490
I've conducted myself
in a different manner

862
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,493
than everybody,
you know-- unique.

863
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,495
Uh, was it smart?
I don't know.

864
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,914
Did it make me feel good?
Absolutely.

865
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:35,664
Yeah. I mean, I'm
very comfortable

866
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,125
with them judging me
at this point.

867
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,169
JEFF:
Last question-- Sue:

868
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,545
At one point
you said early on...

869
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,588
I think, in fact,
it might have been to Rich...

870
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,257
I'm not sure.

871
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,301
One of the first few days
here, you said, "Listen--

872
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,677
"I'm just a redneck
and corporate America

873
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,804
isn't going
to play here."

874
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,138
RICHARD:
Oh, she sure did.

875
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,598
But just a couple
of Tribal Councils ago,

876
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,974
you made a pretty good case

877
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,975
for the fact
that what goes on here

878
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,852
at<i> Survivor</i>
<i>is really no different</i>

879
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,355
than what goes on
in corOh, yeah.erica.

880
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,065
So my question is
what has won out--

881
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,317
simple Midwestern values,
or the harsh reality

882
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:03,901
of corporate life?

883
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,195
It ain't over with yet,

884
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,781
so you can't say who's
won out yet, eh?

885
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,658
The idea of money--

886
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,326
money makes
the world go round.

887
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,037
Money is greed, money is
what everybody thrives for.

888
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,832
I don't care what
anybody says anymore.

889
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,293
Um... it's what spins us.

890
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,503
It can make life
a little bit easier.

891
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,672
If you're,
you know, struggling,

892
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,673
or whatever,

893
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,341
it helps.

894
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:30,469
Big fights, divorces happen
over shortages of money,

895
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,680
so... a lot to be said
about money, Jeff.

896
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,849
That's what we're talking about.

897
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,475
On that note...

898
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,476
it's time to vote.

899
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,937
Rich.

900
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,197
I'm voting for Sue tonight.

901
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,866
Not for any particular reason.

902
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,534
She's a good friend of mine

903
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,327
and will always be
a good friend of mine,

904
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,746
<i>but it's a self-</i>
<i>preservation maneuver</i>

905
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,748
and, uh, needed to be done.

906
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,927
It was fun.

907
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:12,970
Good luck, buddy.

908
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,770
Fire definitely represents
life on the island.

909
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:26,025
Across from you now,
11 staffs.

910
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:26,609
Another one
will be added

911
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,195
to that
group tonight.

912
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,905
Four of you will
move on.

913
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,948
I'll go tally the votes.

914
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,720
Once the votes are tallied,
the decision is final

915
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,265
and the person will be asked
to leave the island immediately.

916
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,726
I'll read the votes.

917
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,691
"Sue."

918
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,157
"Sean."

919
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,411
"Sean."

920
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,792
"Sean."

921
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,920
You need to bring
me your torch.

922
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,302
Maybe the jungle
is speaking to us.

923
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,764
SEAN:
Wow... someone snuck up
behind me. Come on.

924
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,057
It went out
during the vote.

925
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,558
No...

926
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,227
The tribe has spoken,
the jungle has spoken.

927
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,396
It's time
for you to go.

928
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,814
I'll see you in a few days.

929
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,691
Good-bye.

930
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,704
JEFF:
Sean's torch went out

931
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,164
during the Tribal Council.

932
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,666
Since the merger,

933
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,835
every person voted off

934
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,420
has had their torch go out.

935
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,838
You guys have made it
to the final four.

936
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,922
We'll have a final
Tribal Council,

937
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,675
where the jury will decide
who leaves this island

938
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,137
with a lot
of bragging rights

939
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,804
and a lot of cash.

940
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,682
You can head back to camp.

941
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,476
I'll see you
tomorrow.

I like to think I was
the last good person down.

945
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:53,672
I hope that's the way
America remembers me.

953

It's been a blast. Bye.
