1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,338
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR"... GO!

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,550
20 OF THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGE
CENTERS "SURVIVOR" HISTORY WERE

3
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:12,595
BATTLING IT OUT.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,433
THE MANA TRIBE WAS ON A LOSING
STREAK.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,102
NUKU WINS THEIR SECOND CHALLENGE
IN A ROW.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,606
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT WAS A
BATTLE BETWEEN "SURVIVOR"

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,233
ROYALTY.

8
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,110
AND ONLY ONE COULD KEEP THEIR
CROWN.

9
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:31,114
>> YOU KNOW THAT SAYING, "YOU'RE
ONLY THE KING UNTIL THE QUEEN

10
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:31,781
ARRIVES?

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,158
I'M HERE.

12
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,620
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
NOBILITY TOOK A BACK SEAT.

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,583
>> TO TONY EVERYTHING IS
PARANOIA.

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,753
>> Jeff: AS SANDRA SLAYED HER
NEMESIS AND KEPT HER TITLE.

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,005
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR
PLOTTING AGAINST ME.

16
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,047
>> GOOD JOB.

17
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,132
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU GET, AND THE
QUEEN STAYS QUEEN.

18
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,803
>> Jeff: TONY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

19
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,307
>> Jeff: CAN SANDRA KEEP HER
EMPIRE INTACT?

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,516
18 ARE LEFT.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,230
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

22
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:19,746
COME ON IN, GUYS.

23
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,540
NUKU GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
THE NEW MANA TRIBE.

24
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,668
TONY VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

25
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,211
>> WOW.

26
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:30,799
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

27
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,716
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,303
LET'S SEE HOW SAVVY YOU GUYS ARE
AS A GROUP.

29
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,681
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,225
>> WE'RE ABOUT TO SWAP.

31
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,643
>> Jeff: YOU'RE RIGHT.

32
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,229
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR BUFFS.

33
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,356
>> WOW.

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,649
>> BYE, BABY.

35
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:52,153
>> I WAS LEADING THE SHEEP TO
SLAUGHTER, SO I AM IN A GOOD

36
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,322
SPOT WITH MANBACK BUT NOW
THERE'S A SWAP, AND I HOPE I'M

37
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:58,535
ON THE RIGHT SIDE WITH THE
STRONGEST PEOPLE.

38
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,078
>> Jeff: SHALL WE GET TO IT?

39
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:00,662
>> YEAH.

40
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,038
>> Jeff: HERE WE GO.

41
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,165
>> OH, MY GOSH, MY HEART IS
POUNDING.

42
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:04,916
>> MINE IS, TOO.

43
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,251
I'M GOING TO HAVE A HEART
ATTACK.

44
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:11,881
>> Jeff: MICHAELA DOESN'T EVEN
WANT TO LOOK.

45
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:17,554
HALI.

46
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,099
SIERRA, CIRIE, J.T. CLOSES HIS
EYES.

47
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,269
NOBODY IS LOOKING.

48
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:24,894
ZEKE.

49
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,397
>> THE GODS CHOSE FOR ME.

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,399
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

51
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,068
EVERYBODY REVEAL.

52
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,697
YOUR NEW TRIBES.

53
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,365
HOLD 'EM UP ONCE YOU GET IT, PUT
'EM ON.

54
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,075
>> OH, BOY.

55
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,910
>> OH, MY GOSH.

56
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,538
>> I'M GREEN?

57
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,750
>> Jeff: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
DREW A GREEN BUFF, YOU ARE NOW

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,420
REALIZING WE ARE CHANGING FROM
TWO TRIBES TO THREE TRIBES.

59
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:55,258
>> YOU'RE STARTING OVER.

60
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,719
>> Jeff: IF YOU ARE GREEN,
TAKE A SPOT IN THE MIDDLE.

61
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,596
YOU ARE ON A BRAND-NEW TRIBE.

62
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,097
>> WELCOME.

63
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,978
>> Jeff: JUST LIKE THAT,
EVERYTHING IS A MIX.

64
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:07,979
>> I'M MICHAELA.

65
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,274
>> OH, MY GOD.

66
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:11,941
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

67
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,444
LET'S LOOK AT OUR NEW TRIBES.

68
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,739
MANA, CALEB, IMMEDIATELY YOU AND
HALI ARE A LITTLE BIT ON THE

69
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,199
WRONG SIDE OF THE NUMBERS AS THE
ONLY TWO FROM MANA.

70
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,284
>> YEAH.

71
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,912
>> Jeff: TAI, WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO BE REUNITED WITH CALEB?

72
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:29,250
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE WITH
CALEB WAS AS HE GOT ON A

73
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,128
HELICOPTER AND WAS BEING
EVACUATED FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE.

74
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,464
>> IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE HIM ALL
GOOD.

75
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,467
I'M STILL LOOKING FOR THAT KISS.

76
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,469
>> DO IT, DO IT!

77
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,470
>> RIGHT HERE.

78
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,429
>> THERE.

79
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,933
NOW I GOT IT.

80
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,017
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

81
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,020
LET'S LOOK AT THE NEW NUKU
TRIBE.

82
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,522
J.T., YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY FROM
YOUR OLD TRIBE.

83
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,316
YOU'RE WITH FIVE PEOPLE FROM
MANA.

84
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,527
HISTORICALLY IN "SURVIVOR," THAT
WOULD PUT YOU ON THE WRONG SIDE

85
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,779
OF THE NUMBERS.

86
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,865
>> THERE'S ALWAYS A BAD SIDE OF
THINGS, BUT IT ALWAYS ENDS UP

87
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,491
GOOD.

88
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,492
WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

89
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,662
>> Jeff: AND NOW LET'S GO TO
THE BRAND-NEW TRIBE.

90
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:10,708
GREEN, YOUR NAME IS TAVUA.

91
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,837
TROYZAN, MUCH LIKE J.T., YOU'RE
THE ONLY GUY FROM YOUR FORMER

92
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,507
TRIBE MIXED WITH FIVE FROM NUKU.

93
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,468
IS THIS A BAD THING, OR IS IT
UNKNOWN?

94
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,472
>> AT FIRST IT'S BAD BECAUSE
IT'S FIVE AND ONE, BUT I HAVE

95
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,307
THE LOOK FOR THE SILVER LINING
SOMEWHERE.

96
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,979
>> Jeff: HERE'S A MAP, TAVUA,
TO YOUR HOME, AND A FLINT TO GET

97
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,522
YOU STARTED.

98
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,984
TO BE CLEAR, YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO A NEW CAMP.

99
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,362
YOU'LL HAVE THE SAME ORIGINAL
SUPPLIES THAT YOU STARTED THE

100
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,697
GAME WITH.

101
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,491
BASIC FISHING GEAR, A POT,
MACHETE, AND A TINY PORTION OF

102
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,242
RICE.

103
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,661
YOU'LL HAVE TO BUILD A NEW
SHELTER.

104
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:50,707
YOU ARE STARTING OVER.

105
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,836
BUT THE ADVANTAGE THAT ALL OF
YOU HAVE IS HAVING PLAYED

106
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,381
BEFORE, YOU KNOW THAT AT THIS
MOMENT ANYTHING IS STILL

107
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,507
POSSIBLE.

108
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,634
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

109
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,969
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

110
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,220
GOOD LUCK.

111
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:07,724
>> WITH GAME CHANGERS, THE GAME
CHANGES FAST, BUT WHATEVER I'M

112
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,517
DEALT WITH, I'M GOING TO MAKE
THE BEST OF IT.

113
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,437
IT'S AN EXCITING TIME I THINK.

114
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,563
I LOVE IT.

115
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:20,069
I'M READY TO GO.

116
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,405
>> THE CHICKENS ARE LOOSE.

117
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,450
THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE
RUNNING AWAY.

118
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,576
THEY CAN CLEAN UP AROUND CAMP.

119
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,119
THEY'RE PRETTY TRAINED.

120
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,038
>> THEY'RE TRAINED CHICKENS?

121
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,751
>> YOU WALK INTO THE NUKU CAMP
AFTER SPENDING SIX, SEVEN DAYS

122
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,921
AT MANA WHERE WE DIDN'T GET THE
CHICKENS AND TOOLKIT, IT'S

123
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,797
SHOCKING.

124
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,425
I COULDN'T PICK MY JAW UP OFF
THE FLOOR.

125
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,801
LOOK AT ALL OF THIS.

126
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,597
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,181
>> THE BALL.

128
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,099
>> THE TREES HAVE BALLS.

129
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,102
>> THEY DECORATED THE DAMN
TREES.

130
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,437
IT'S THE "SURVIVOR" JACKPOT.

131
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,605
IT'S LIKE GOING TO A RESORT.

132
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,647
EVERYTHING IS ALREADY BUILT.

133
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,817
THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF FOOD THEY
DIDN'T TAKE WITH THEM.

134
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,486
THE CHICKENS ARE WALKING AROUND
FREE LIKE THEY OWN THE PLACE.

135
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,614
THEY HAVE AN AWESOME SHELTER AND
THEY DECORATED.

136
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,616
THAT'S HOW WELL IT'S GOING ON IN
THIS TRIBE.

137
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,953
THEY'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO HANG
DAMN ORNAMENTS IN THE TREES LIKE

138
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,872
WE'RE AT SOME DINNER PARLOR IN
MEXICO.

139
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,500
>> I FEEL LIKE WE'VE RUN A
REWARD.

140
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,584
I'M SPEECHLESS.

141
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,587
I THINK I'VE SAID THREE WORDS
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

142
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,506
I'M KIND OF HAPPY ABOUT THIS
SWAP.

143
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:27,303
I DIDN'T EXPECT I'D BE SWAPPED
OUT 5 TO 1, BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

144
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,473
I FEEL LIKE THE "SURVIVOR" GODS
REALLY LET ME DOWN.

145
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,683
5 TO 1 IS ABOUT AS BAD AS I CAN
HOPE FOR.

146
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,852
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD I'M A SITTING
DUCK.

147
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,272
THE ONLY THING AT THIS POINT
THAT CAN SAVE ME WOULD BE A

148
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,315
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

149
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,650
I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO
STIR THINGS UP HERE.

150
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,986
I GOT TO TAKE YOU ALL OUT
SNORKELING?

151
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,196
>> YEAH.

152
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,991
>> IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, IF I
CAN GET THEM OUT THERE IN THE

153
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:53,496
OCEAN, I CAN GET BACK THE CAMP
AND START LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

154
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,499
>> GEEZ, LOUISE, THIS IS
GORGEOUS.

155
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:02,547
>> THERE MUST BE SOME FISHING
GOING ON OVER HERE.

156
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,631
>> WOW.

157
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,841
BEAUTIFUL.

158
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:10,304
I GET EVERYONE ON THE RAFT, I
DRAG THEM OUT TO SEA A GOOD HALF

159
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:10,847
MILE.

160
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,807
WE SNORKEL A LITTLE BIT.

161
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,517
GET 'EM STARTED FISHING.

162
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,062
AND FINALLY THAT OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTS ITSELF WHEN MALCOLM

163
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,689
BENDS THE SPEAR.

164
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,690
>> THAT'S LIKE ONE HIT ON THE
CORAL.

165
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,691
>> YEAH.

166
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,734
>> DID YOU LOSE ANOTHER ONE OR
JUST ONE?

167
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,196
>> NO, JUST THE ONE FELL OFF,
LIKE CLEAN OFF.

168
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,699
>> YOU KNOW WHAT WE REALLY NEED,
WE REALLY NEED THE PLIERS.

169
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,533
>> I FEEL BAD.

170
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,244
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

171
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,204
>> I'LL GO BACK AND GET THE
PLIERS.

172
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,207
YOU ALL JUST ENJOY THIS GOOD
TIME OUT HERE ON THE OCEAN.

173
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,542
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

174
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,211
>> ISN'T THIS WEIRD J.T. IS IN
THE HERE?

175
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:51,721
WE KIND OF RAIDED THEIR CAMP AND
HIJACKED IT FOR THE DAY.

176
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,265
>> I CAME TO GET THE PLIERS.

177
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,433
I NOVI TO BE BACK SOON.

178
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,227
I HAVE TO TAKE EVERY SECOND I
CAN TO LOOK.

179
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,731
I'M LOOKING IN EVERY NOOK, EVERY
TREE, EVERY CORNER, EVERY SPOT,

180
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:09,864
EVERY HOLE IN A TREE, UP IN THE
TREES.

181
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,698
>> WHAT DOES HE THINK HE'S
DOING?

182
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,576
>> I KNOW.

183
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,244
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BUDDY?

184
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,038
>> HE MIGHT KNOW WHERE THE IDOL
IS.

185
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,414
>> HE MIGHT KNOW.

186
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:22,418
HE HIGH KNOW SOMETHING.

187
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,922
>> HE MIGHT BE UP THERE SAVING
HIS ASS.

188
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,258
>> WE SAT OUT THERE ON THAT
RAFT.

189
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,259
HE DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG.

190
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,552
WHAT'S HE DOING?

191
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,639
I'M THINKING, HE'S LOOKING FOR
AN IDOL.

192
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,559
WHAT A GREAT WAY TO GET RID OF
THE FIVE PEOPLE THAT MIGHT TAKE

193
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:38,893
YOU DOWN.

194
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,269
BRILLIANT.

195
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,729
>> PRETTY MUCH.

196
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,398
>> NOPE.

197
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,274
IDOLLESS.

198
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,945
I'M JUST FRANTICALLY LOOKING
EVERYWHERE.

199
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,073
NOPE.

200
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:52,615
IT'S NEVER OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER.

201
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,616
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

202
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,869
AND THEY PROBABLY KNOW I'M
LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

203
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,415
I TOOK THEM AS FAR OUT IN THE
OCEAN AS I COULD, AND I LEFT THE

204
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:01,999
PLIERS ON PURPOSE.

205
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,001
MY JOB IS TO KEEP LOOKING.

206
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:04,710
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

207
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,754
>> HE TOTALLY LEFT US OUT HERE.

208
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,463
HE LEFT US.

209
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,173
THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT HAPPENED.

210
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:09,882
>> HE'S DANGEROUS.

211
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,594
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING.

212
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,763
IF J.T.'S OUT LOOKING FOR AN
IDOL.

213
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,305
GOOD FOR J.T.

214
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,306
IT JUST DOESN'T MATTER.

215
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,683
WE HAVE THE MAJORITY, 5-1, SO
J.T. IS SCREWED.

216
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,002
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

217
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,836
WE'RE GOING THE MAKE THIS HOUSE
A HOME.

218
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,506
>> OH, HE'S AN INTERIOR
DESIGNER.

219
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:53,676
>> THIS IS MY NEW HOME, SO I
START THINKING, LET ME MAKE THIS

220
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,012
HOUSE A HOME.

221
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,390
I LOVE ANTIQUING AND I LIKE TO
DECORATE.

222
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,643
MONICA AND I SPEND A LOT OF...

223
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,186
WE DECORATE OUR OWN HOUSE.

224
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,271
WE'LL MAKE THIS A HOME NOW.

225
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,355
>> YEAH, BRAD.

226
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,357
>> I RELAX AS I'M DOING THAT.

227
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:08,733
IT GIVES ME SOMETHING TO THINK
ABOUT.

228
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,693
>> AWESOME.

229
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,986
AWESOME, BRAD.

230
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:17,158
>> WE'RE HERE, MEAGER SUPPLIES,
MEAGER FOOD, IN AN UNBELIEVABLE

231
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:22,246
GAME, DIFFICULT, BUT I'M HAVING
A LOT OF FUN BECAUSE IT'S 4-2,

232
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,956
AND I'M THINKING, I'M IN GOOD
SHAPE.

233
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,710
THE FOUR OF US IN NUKU ARE GOING
THE STAY TOGETHER.

234
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:32,256
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO HALI
OR CALEB.

235
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,884
>> HALI, I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER
BEING AROUND THESE PEOPLE.

236
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,010
>> OH, THANK YOU.

237
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:36,886
>> I REALLY DO.

238
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,762
>> REALLY?

239
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,346
GOOD.

240
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,098
>> I LIKE YOU ALL A LOT.

241
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,560
>> WE HAVE TO PLAY IT LIKE WE'RE
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

242
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,396
CALEB AND I ARE AT THE BOTTOM
NUMBERS-WISE.

243
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:47,980
>> IT'S SO DIFFERENT THE SECOND
TIME.

244
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,231
WE'RE NOT NAIVE.

245
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,777
>> CALEB AND TAI COULD GET BACK
TOGETHER AND PUT A BIG TARGET ON

246
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,903
THEIR BACK.

247
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:59,241
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M MAYBE NOT
THE MOST OBVIOUS TARGET.

248
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,744
>> I FEEL GOOD WITH YOU HERE.

249
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,455
THE TRIBE IS REALLY STRONG.

250
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,957
>> WE SHOULD KEEP CALEB BECAUSE
HE'S GOING TO HELP WITH

251
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,210
CHALLENGES.

252
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,295
SERIOUSLY, I WOULD CHANGE DEBBIE
FOR CALEB.

253
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,548
>> SHE SEEMS TO BE LOYAL.

254
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,341
>> YOU THINK SO IN.

255
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,929
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT OVER
CALEB.

256
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:24,600
I'M TALKING ABOUT CALEB.

257
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,768
I MEAN, CALEB AFTER DEBBIE.

258
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,270
>> IT'S UP TO US.

259
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:28,938
>> ALL RIGHT.

260
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:29,772
GOOD.

261
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,940
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

262
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,943
>> TRUTHFULLY, I WOULDN'T MIND
GETTING RID OF CALEB FIRST.

263
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,277
>> WHAT?

264
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,445
STOP IT.

265
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:42,952
>> CALEB, DEBBIE AND TAI PLAYED
TOGETHER ON "SURVIVOR."

266
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,456
I'M TRYING TO BRING TAI AND
DEBBIE CLOSER TO ME THAN ANYBODY

267
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:47,957
ELSE.

268
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,833
>> HOW YOU DOING?

269
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,333
WE GOOD?

270
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,126
>> HUH?

271
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:50,501
GOOD?

272
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,794
>> YEAH, YEAH.

273
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,795
>> WAIT, WAIT.

274
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,296
I JUST TALKED TO BRAD.

275
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,632
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO SIERRA YET.

276
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,593
I SAY I'D RATHER YOU WITH US
BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE A LOT

277
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,302
STRONGER TO HELP WITH
CHALLENGES.

278
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,011
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

279
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,764
>> TAI ANDRY BACK TOGETHER
AGAIN.

280
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,976
IT'S A GREAT FEELING BECAUSE WE
JUST HAVE REALLY GOOD, CLOSE

281
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,893
FRIENDSHIP.

282
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,105
I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE WHAT WE
HAD BEFORE.

283
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:15,609
>> DO YOU WORK WITH ANY OTHER
PEOPLE ON OUR OTHER TRIBE?

284
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,026
>> JEFF AND MALCOLM.

285
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,486
NO ONE ELSE.

286
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,821
>> ALL RIGHT.

287
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,491
LET'S HAVE THAT AS AN OPTION.

288
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,495
THE PLAN IS TO VOTE OFF HALI AND
CALEB.

289
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,956
I KNOW I CROSSED THE LINE, BUT I
THIS WANT THE PLAY WITH CALEB.

290
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,792
WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH
BEFORE.

291
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,669
WE HAVE A PRETTY BIG
RELATIONSHIP.

292
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,379
BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
HAPPENED LAST TIME.

293
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,008
I'M PUT IN A POSITION TO BETRAY
MY FRIENDS, BUT I PROTECT MY

294
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,343
BUDDY, I HAVE TO BETRAY BRAD.

295
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,887
SO I'M WEIGHING THE RISKS.

296
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:50,102
EITHER WAY IT'S GOING TO HURT.

297
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,520
>> ALLIGHT.

298
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,646
OUR NEW HOME.

299
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,067
>> HOME SWEET HOME.

300
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,068
>> WELCOME.

301
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,862
>> OH, THANK YOU, GUYS.

302
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:04,408
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF NICE
BECAUSE I'VE GOT A BUNCH OF... I

303
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,285
HAVE A CHAOTIC TRIBE.

304
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,580
WE GET UP TO CAMP AND THERE'S
NOTHING BUT FISHING GEAR AND A

305
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,666
MEAGER AMOUNT OF RICE, A POT AND
A MACHETE.

306
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,252
YOU KNOW IT'S CONGENIAL.

307
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,046
WE'RE TRYING TO BE NICE TO
TROYZAN.

308
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,842
I'M SURE HE FEELS LIKE HE'S ON
THE OUTS BECAUSE FOR ALL INTENTS

309
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,010
AND PURPOSES HE IS.

310
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,222
>> WE MIGHT HAVE A SLIGHTLY
WORSE CAMP THAN OUR OLD CAMP.

311
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,598
WE HAVE MORE COCONUTS.

312
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,101
WE HAVE MORE PALM FRONDS FOR
SHELTER.

313
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,311
SO THAT'S NICE.

314
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,565
>> WE GOT TO START FROM THE
BEGINNING, AND I'VE GOT TO TAKE

315
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,111
THE LEAD BECAUSE I GOT LIKE 115
DAYS ON "SURVIVOR" MORE OR LESS.

316
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,112
THIS IS A POST.

317
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,073
I AM ONE OF THE VETERANS IN THIS
GAME.

318
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,200
I HAVE PLAYED THIS FOUR TIMES
NOW.

319
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:50,037
AND THIS IS A CHANCE TO LET MY
TRIBE KNOW THAT I STILL GOT THE

320
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:57,378
SKILLS AND THAT THEY CAN'T GET
RID OF ME YET.

321
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,754
>> WE'RE SAFE, RIGHT?

322
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,505
>> ABSOLUTELY.

323
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,548
>> WE'RE GOOD?

324
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,757
>> WE'RE GOOD.

325
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,593
>> I WASN'T ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF
THE NUMBERS IN THE OLD NUKU

326
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:09,431
TRIBE, AND I THINK OZZY IS STILL
A LITTLE SKITTISH OF ME, BUT I'M

327
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,100
TRYING TO CULTIVATE A
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM, SO I NEED

328
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:16,355
THE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS NEW
START.

329
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,982
I'M HOPING THAT WILL HELP ME
LATER ON DOWN THE LINE.

330
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:18,983
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

331
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:24,780
>> I FEEL GOOD.

332
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:25,155
WE GOT NUMBERS.

333
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:25,614
>> HELL, YEAH.

334
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,824
>> I FEEL GREAT.

335
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,033
>> ON THE ORIGINAL NUKU TRIBE, I
DIDN'T HAVE A STRONG ALLIANCE

336
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,620
WITH CIRIE, BUT HERE WE NEED
EACH OTHER, SO THIS IS A CRUCIAL

337
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,122
TIME FOR ME TO BUILD TRUST.

338
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:41,088
IF WE DO, TROYZAN CAN BE AN EASY
FIRST ONE TO GO.

339
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:47,177
>> TO ANDREA, I HAVE THE FLAG?

340
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,555
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

341
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,015
>> I DON'T?

342
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:56,937
>> TROYZAN IS A SUPER COOL GUY,
BUT IT'S "SURVIVOR" AND IT'S A

343
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,813
NUMBERS GAME.

344
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:00,441
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM FEEL
COMFORTABLE.

345
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,110
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ALL THE
RELATIONSHIPS.

346
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:03,861
>> RIGHT.

347
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,155
>> SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE OTHER
IDEAS.

348
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,325
>> I JUST WANT THE SAY AT LEAST
HELLO.

349
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,534
>> I KNOW, I KNOW, OF COURSE.

350
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,163
>> ANDREA, COME ON, SHE ACTS
LIKE SHE'S MY BUDDY, BUT SHE'S A

351
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,040
LITTLE DEVIL THAT ONE.

352
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,543
SHE JUST... I KNOW SHE'S PLAYING
A GAME.

353
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,338
SHE'S NOT AS CLEVER I THINK AS
SHE THINKS SHE IS.

354
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,132
>> I'M GOING TO PROBABLY TAKE
THIS UP BECAUSE I'M BURNING.

355
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,717
>> OKAY.

356
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,968
I'M GOING TO GO GET WATER.

357
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:28,427
>> COME ON.

358
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,012
I'M 54 YEARS OLD.

359
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,013
I'M THE OLDEST GUY OUT HERE.

360
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,349
BUT MY INTUITION IS GOOD.

361
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:38,395
AND I FEEL LIKE I LEARNED SO
MUCH FROM ONE WORLD.

362
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,189
I FOUND AN IDOL THEN WHEN I HAD
TO FIND ONE.

363
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:44,735
I WON IMMUNITY WHEN I HAD TO AND
CHANGED THE GAME.

364
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,237
SO THIS TIME I WILL NOT LET ANY
STONE BE UNTURNED.

365
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,032
I'M GOING TO START TO AT LEAST
LOOK FOR THE IDOL.

366
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,035
>> WE REALLY DO HAVE TO WATCH
HIM.

367
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:53,994
>> YEAH.

368
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,830
>> BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT HIM
GETTING AN IDOL.

369
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,666
>> NO.

370
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,627
>> HE'S SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT WE'RE ALL WATCHING HIM.

371
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,503
>> YEAH.

372
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:13,222
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO GO FOR A
LONG TIME.

373
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:21,730
>> WOW.

374
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:27,027
I THOUGHT I LOST MY LIFE FOR A
SECOND THERE.

375
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:27,403
THANK GOD.

376
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,195
OKAY.

377
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,279
CONGRATULATIONS.

378
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,241
YOU HAVE FOUND A CLUE TO A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT IT

379
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,077
WILL REQUIRE YOU TO BE DARING.

380
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,203
I'M THAT.

381
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:40,040
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A PUZZLE
SOLVER IN ORDER TO NAB IT.

382
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,250
THANK YOU.

383
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,753
YOUR NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, IF
YOU ARE BOLD ENOUGH TO RISK

384
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:49,091
MAKING A GAME-CHANGING MOVE IN
FRONT OF YOUR UNSUSPECTING TRIBE

385
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:55,264
MATES AND IMMONTI IS YOURS AND
IT WILL BE -- AT THE NEXT

386
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,099
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, IT'S GOING
TO BE CRAZY.

387
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,934
IT'S GOING TO BE HUGELY
DIFFICULT BECAUSE I HAVE TWO

388
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,938
THINGS TO THINK ABOUT, WINNING A
SUPER TOUGH GAME-CHANGING

389
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,607
CHALLENGE, PLUS I ALSO HAVE TO
FIND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IN

390
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,442
FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

391
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,112
I HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT.

392
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,366
BUT IF I CAN DO IT, IT'S A
COMPLETE 180.

393
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:14,658
TROYZAN'S BACK.

394
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,242
I THINK.

395
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,967
>> THERE ARE GOATS EVERYWHERE
HERE.

396
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,595
I CAN GET PROBABLY 20 YARDS FROM
THEM.

397
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,472
>> WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO GET
ONE?

398
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,349
>> IF YOU'RE HUNGRY ENOUGH WE
CAN.

399
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:45,397
I TOLD THEM WE COULDN'T CATCH
IT, BUT WE CAN.

400
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,649
SANDRA SAID SHE'D LOVE A GOAT.

401
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,817
I COULD PROBABLY CATCH ONE FOR
YOU.

402
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,155
>> AND THERE GOES ONE OF THE
GOATS RIGHT THERE, A GRAY AND

403
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,281
WHITE ONE.

404
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,824
THAT'S OUR MEAL RIGHT THERE.

405
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,743
OH, THEY'RE LIKE RIGHT THERE.

406
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,870
>> THERE'S AT LEAST SIX.

407
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,163
I'VE SEEN SIX.

408
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,082
>> I DON'T REALLY WANT THE CATCH
AND EAT A GOAT, BUT FIRST THING

409
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,543
I NEED TO DO IS KEEP MYSELF
SAFE.

410
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,130
IF I CAN FEED SANDRA AND MAKE
HER HAPPY, I THINK SANDRA WILL

411
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,382
PROBABLY LOVE ME TO DEATH, AND
THAT WILL PROBABLY KEEP ME SAFER

412
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,050
IN THIS GAME.

413
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,676
>> THERE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE.

414
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,012
SEE THAT BLACK AND WHITE ONE.

415
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,347
>> HE'S COMING, MALCOLM.

416
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,224
>> MALCOLM!

417
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,391
WE CAN CATCH 'EM BY HAND.

418
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:30,275
>> HOW?

419
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:43,205
>> IS HE CHASING A GOAT?

420
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,541
>> I GOT IT.

421
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,000
>> OKAY.

422
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:54,049
GIVE ME THAT.

423
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,426
[GOAT CRYING]
>> BE CAREFUL WITH THE HORNS.

424
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,597
>> I'LL GET ROPE.

425
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,057
MALCOLM, STAY WITH HIM.

426
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,101
GRAB THEM BACK LEGS OR
SOMETHING.

427
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,102
>> YOU GOT IT?

428
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,771
>> CATCHING A GOAT WAS NEVER ON
MY BUCKET LIST.

429
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,108
WE PICK IT UP AND START HEADING
BACK THE CAMP AND REALIZE THE

430
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,318
ONLY REASON WE CAUGHT IT WAS
BECAUSE IT WAS MAMA GET AND IT

431
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:17,281
DIDN'T WANT THE RUN AWAY FROM
ITS BABIES, SO WE DON'T HAVE A

432
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,075
CHOICE WE WON'T KILL HIM BECAUSE
WE HAVE A CONSCIENCE.

433
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:25,747
WE HAVE TO EAT, BUT I HAVE TO BE
VERY CAREFUL WHAT I SAY TO

434
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,582
SANDRA.

435
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,417
SHE DESPERATELY WANTS TO EAT THE
GOAT.

436
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,419
THERE IS NO NEED THE MAKE
ENEMIES OR CAUSED ANGST IN THIS

437
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,587
CAMP.

438
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,339
>> DON'T GET TOO ATTACHED
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR

439
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:34,715
MEAL.

440
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,674
>> THE BABY?

441
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,927
>> SANDRA DON'T CARE ABOUT
KILLING THESE GOATS.

442
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,636
IN HER MIND IT'S JUST FOOD.

443
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,722
SHE WAS A VILLAIN FOR A REASON.

444
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,433
>> I WAS SO... IT'S A MOMMY
GOAT?

445
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,684
>> SO SAD.

446
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:50,105
>> I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG
WITH KILLING AND EATING A GOAT.

447
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,440
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE HERE, FOR
FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

448
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,943
>> SHE'S NOT GOING NOWHERE WITH
THAT MAMA.

449
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,944
WE'RE GOING TO LET HER GO.

450
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,529
>> YOU MEAN LET THE BABY GO.

451
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,823
>> SHE'LL STAY WITH THE MAMA NO
MATTER WHAT.

452
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,576
>> EVERYONE WANTS THE ADD THEIR
TWO CREPTS IN.

453
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,454
I GOT TO GET EVERYBODY TO DO IT
AS A GROUP BECAUSE THAT'S THE

454
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,956
PLAN TO, CATCH IT, TO CATCH
SOMETHING AND KILL IT.

455
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,499
>> I CAN'T HARDLY EAT EITHER ONE
OF THEM.

456
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,045
>> WHAT YOU MEAN?

457
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,463
>> A BABY AND A MAMA.

458
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:19,134
>> IT IS THE GOAT VERSION OF
BAMBI RIGHT NOW.

459
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:23,138
>> I DIDN'T EXPECT THE CATCH A
GATE THIS QUICK.

460
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,974
THERE'S IN WAY I'M GOING TO KILL
THAT MAMA GOAT AND HER BABY.

461
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,934
I CAN'T DO IT.

462
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,937
>> IF I CAN CATCH ONE THAT DON'T
HAVE A BABY.

463
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,648
>> YOU WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN
CATCH A MALE AND LET THESE TWO

464
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,148
GOAT.

465
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,107
>> LET'S TAKE A VOTE.

466
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,359
>> SANDRA WANTS TO EAT A GOAT.

467
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:39,154
SHE'S RUNNING THE SHOW, BUT, YOU
KNOW, I'D RATHER LET THESE GOAT

468
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,364
GOSS.

469
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,991
SEE IF WE CAN CATCH ANOTHER
RANDOM GOAT THAT'S NOT A MAMA OR

470
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,992
A BABY.

471
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,662
I'M GOING TO TRY MY BEST TO SAVE
THE GOAT.

472
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,496
>> YOUR THOUGHTS?

473
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,373
>> I'M HUNGRY.

474
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,290
BUT I CAN'T.

475
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,167
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY
PART OF IT?

476
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,293
>> THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

477
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,670
>> OKAY.

478
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,046
>> WHAT ABOUT YOU?

479
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,508
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO KILL IT,
BUT I'LL HELP YOU CLEAN IT,

480
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,550
CLEAN THE CARCASS.

481
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,345
>> YOU CAN TELL WHO IS FOR IT
AND WHO IS AGAINST IT

482
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,513
IMMEDIATELY.

483
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,516
SANDRA DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN,
WHICH IS JUST SANDRA'S M.O.

484
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,143
ABOUT LIFE I'VE STARTED TO
REALIZE.

485
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,980
BUT EVERYBODY ELSE STARTS
TALKING IT THROUGH AND NO ONE

486
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,984
WANTS TO BE THE "SURVIVOR" THAT
ABANDONED A BABY GOAT MOTHERLESS

487
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:17,734
TO THE WILD.

488
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,986
>> MY HEART WANTS TO LET THEM
GO.

489
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:19,861
>> MINE, TOO.

490
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,990
I FELT BAD THE MOMENT I PUT IT
IN MY HANDS.

491
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,158
>> RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE FOUR
CHICKENS.

492
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,203
WE GOT CHICKENS RIGHT THERE, AND
THOSE ARE MEANT TO EAT, YOU

493
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,037
KNOW?

494
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,540
AND SO I DON'T SEE HOW IT MAKES
SENSE.

495
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,250
>> THERE'S ALL THIS MEAT AROUND.

496
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,668
WE'RE NOT EATING ANY OF IT.

497
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,085
IT'S CRAZY.

498
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,044
>> AMEN TO THAT.

499
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,171
>> SO YOU'RE ALL DOWN WITH
EATING A CHICKEN?

500
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,673
>> J.T., WE'RE EATING A CHICKEN.

501
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,551
>> THIS IS AN EASY DECISION
BECAUSE WE HAVE A HEART.

502
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,511
WE'RE NOT GOING TO KILL EITHER
OF THE GOATS.

503
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,595
SO WE ENDED UP LETTING THE GOATS
GO.

504
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,726
>> GO AHEAD, UNTIE HER AND LET
HER GO WITH HER BABY.

505
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,893
BYE, MAMA.

506
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,688
>> THAT INITIAL SURGE OF
ADRENALINE AND YOU MOUTHWATERING

507
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,066
SLOWS DOWN A LOT WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT ABANDONING A LITTLE BABY

508
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,067
GOAT.

509
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,570
SO IT MADE SENSE, LIKE IN OUR
HEARTS TO LET IT GO.

510
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,031
>> THEY'RE CALLING FOR EACH
OTHER.

511
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,157
THAT'S SWEET.

512
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,409
>> AND IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH
BETTER FOR THIS TRIBE MOVING

513
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:07,868

SOLVING THE PUZZLE.

560
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,729
>> THIS IDOL BEING HIDDEN ON
THIS TABLE MAKES ME WAY NERVOUS,

561
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,232

00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,191
>> Jeff: NUKU,
CONGRATULATIONS.

691
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,360
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

692
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,695
[APPLAUSE]
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR

693
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,697
TRIBE.

694
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,364
TAVUA.

695
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,783
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

696
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,911
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR
TRIBE.

697
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,537
NOW WE HAVE THE REWARD.

698
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,538
NUKU, YOU'VE ALREADY WON THE
TARP THAT.

699
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,789
IS YOURS.

700
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,335
NOW YOU HAVE A CHOICE, DO YOU
WANT COMFORT FOR BODY OR COMFORT

701
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:55,752
FOR TASTE BUDS.

702
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,920
>> BODY COMFORT.

703
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,838
>> BODY COMFORT.

704
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,549
NUKU, COME GRAB YOUR REWARD.

705
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,967
>> WE FINALLY WON SOMETHING.

706
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,721
>> Jeff: TAVUA, IN ADDITION TO
IMMUNITY, YOU GET THE REMAINING

707
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:09,849
REWARD, COME GRAB IT, SPICES FOR
THE TASTE BUDS.

708
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,936
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

709
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:19,067
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR
TRIBE.

710
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,403
MANA, SOMEBODY WILL BE THE THIRD
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

711
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,071
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

712
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,073
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

713
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,575
>> IN THIS GAME IT'S ALL ABOUT
NUMBERS.

714
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,370
THIS IS A DICTATORSHIP MAJORITY
RULES.

715
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:34,123
SO WE WILL HAVE A BRIEF
NEGOTIATION, WHETHER IT IS CALEB

716
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,250
OR HALI, AND I BELIEVE WE'RE
ROCK SOLID STICKING TOGETHER.

717
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,831
>> WE LOST THE CHALLENGE, LIKE
THE UNTHINKABLE OCCURRED.

718
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,125
SO A MIRACLE WILL HAPPEN IF I'M
TO BE HERE TOMORROW.

719
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,253
>> ARE YOU OKAY WHEN YOU FELL,
CALEB?

720
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,964
>> YEAH.

721
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,424
>> YOU FELL HARD.

722
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,633
IT LOOKED HARD.

723
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:30,805
>> I'M FEELING LIKE TWO AGAINST
FOUR AND CALEB'S A FREAKIN'

724
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:36,019
POWERHOUSE, SO IMMEDIATELY I
KNOW I'M IN HOT WATER.

725
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,812
>> SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GO HOME.

726
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:41,608
>> YOU GUYS HAVE GONE OFF THREE
TIMES NOW.

727
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,817
I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

728
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,985
>> YEAH.

729
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,654
>> I GOT MY HEAD KIND OF DOWN
BECAUSE I JUST HATE THE LOSE,

730
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,657
AND TODAY'S THE NINTH DAY, WHICH
I LEFT LAST TIME.

731
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,993
I GOT LIFE-FLIGHTED OUT ON A
HELICOPTER AND ALMOST LOST MY

732
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,997
LIFE, SO THE ONLY THING ON MY
MIND NOW IS, YOU KNOW, ARE THEY

733
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,167
GOING TO GO STRONG WITH WITH
THIS TRIBE AND KEEP ME AND GIVE

734
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:05,006
ME ANOTHER LIFE IN THIS GAME?

735
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,215
>> SO WHAT'S HAPPENING?

736
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,510
>> WE WANT THE MAKE SURE THAT
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH HALI?

737
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,598
>> I MEAN, SHE'S REALLY NICE,
BUT, YOU KNOW, CALEB AND I,

738
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:18,686
WE'RE FRIENDS, SO CALEB OR HALI,
HALI GOT TO GO.

739
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,228
CALEB, HE CAN HELP.

740
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,521
>> HE'S STRONG.

741
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,358
>> THE TWO NAMES THAT ARE ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT ARE HALI

742
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,609
AND CALEB.

743
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,861
I REALLY HAVEN'T TALKED TO HALI
SINCE I PLAYED WITH HER BEFORE

744
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:31,199
ON WORLDS APART SOME SEEING HER
HERE, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NO

745
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,409
RELATIONSHIP, BUT TAI AND CALEB,
THEY SCARE ME.

746
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,078
THEY'RE CLOSE.

747
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,872
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME
UNDERLYING ALLIANCE THERE.

748
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,332
I MEAN, COME ON.

749
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:43,503
YOU KNOW EACH OTHER, SO, YEAH,
THERE IS A LITTLE CONCERN.

750
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:47,090
BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TARGET A
STRONG PLAYER SUCH AS CALEB,

751
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,218
YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING
CHALLENGES GETS SMALLER AND

752
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,302
SMALLER.

753
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,179
>> WE DEFINITELY GOING TO KEEP
THE NUKU TRIBE STRONG.

754
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,473
>> GOOD.

755
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,724
>> SO IT'S GOING TO BE HALI.

756
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:02,689
>> MY LOGIC IS THIS: I GOT CALEB
AND TAI THAT I COULD POTENTIALLY

757
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:07,735
WORK WITH, BUT TAI AND CALEB HAD
A HISTORY, AND ONE THING I'VE

758
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,364
LEARNED FROM PLAYING BEFORE IS
PAST RELATIONSHIPS ABSOLUTELY

759
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:17,578
MATTER, AND YOU'RE A FOOL TO
DISCOUNT THEM.

760
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,038
>> I'M STICKING TO THE PLAN.

761
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,250
>> I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT WHAT
TAI IS SAYING ABOUT CALEB.

762
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,085
I THINK HE'S PLAYING THE GAME
FOR US RIGHT NOW.

763
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,211
>> YEAH.

764
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:29,132
>> MAYBE GETTING RID OF HALI
WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE.

765
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,176
BUT CALEB, DEBBIE, AND TAI
ABSOLUTELY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP,

766
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,640
AND IF THEY WANT TO TEAM UP,
IE-MAIL SURE THEY WOULD SEND ME

767
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,810
HOME FIRST, BUT RIGHT NOW I
DON'T WANT TO BE THE CHEAT, SO I

768
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,103
WOULD LIKE TAI TO MAKE THE
DECISION.

769
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:47,400
>> SIT DOWN A SECOND.

770
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,317
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

771
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,236
>> HALI'S GOING HOME.

772
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,112
>> OKAY.

773
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,406
>> WHAT IF IT CAME DOWN TO HALI
OR CALEB?

774
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:58,077
>> WE NEED CALEB FOR CHALLENGES.

775
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,495
>> I GUESS.

776
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,330
I THINK SO.

777
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:09,756
HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH CALEB,
YOU GO INTO THE MERGE WITH CALEB

778
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,507
AROUND, IT'S GOING TO HURT YOUR
GAME.

779
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,468
>> I HEAR THAT.

780
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:18,973
>> SO YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR GAME IN

781
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:19,474
THIS SEASON.

782
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,975
>> I SEE THAT, YEP.

783
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:21,976
>> OKAY.

784
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,438
ARE YOU IN IT FOR HIM, OR ARE
YOU IN IT FOR YOU.

785
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,940
>> NEW YORK I'M IN IT FOR
MYSELF.

786
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,152
>> HE GIVE ME SUCH VALUABLE
ADVICE.

787
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:31,861
IT MAKES SENSE.

788
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,321
LAST TIME I PLAYED WITH MY
HEART.

789
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,322
BUT THIS IS GAME CHANGER.

790
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,114
I HAVE TO THINK CLEAR.

791
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,283
>> IT'S IN THE A FINAL DECISION
YET.

792
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,703
>> IF WE GET RID OF CALEB, IT'S
VERY DIFFICULT, BECAUSE I'M A

793
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,788
FRIEND OF CALEB.

794
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,997
WE PLAYED TOGETHER BEFORE.

795
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,168
WE HAD SOME GREAT TIMES, AND
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME

796
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,294
TO THEN WRITE HIS NAME DOWN.

797
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:53,216
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BETRAYAL TO
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

798
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,177
CAN I DO IT?

799
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,305
MY HEART SAYS, HE'S MY FRIEND.

800
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,807
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIVE WITH
IT.

801
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,894
YOU'LL KEEP WE WILL LIVING THIS
MOMENT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

802
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,480
TONIGHT I HAVE TO THINK WITH MY
BRAIN WHO IS A BETTER PERSON THE

803
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:22,537
TAKE OUT, HALI OR CALEB.

804
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,082
>> Jeff: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
DON'T HAVE A TORCH, GO AHEAD AND

805
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:26,707
GRAB ONE.

806
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,878
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

807
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,381
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

808
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,426
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE,
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO

809
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,345
ARE YOU.

810
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:45,059
SO DEBBIE, IS IT COMFORTING OR
UNNERVING THAT YOU, TAI, AND

811
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,728
CALEB ARE ALL HERE TOGETHER AND
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU GUYS PLAYED

812
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,354
TOGETHER?

813
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,273
>> IT'S UNNERVING ACTUALLY.

814
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,693
YOU'RE RIGHT AWAY PERCEIVED TO
BE A TRIO.

815
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,236
YOU MUST HAVE A COMMON BOND.

816
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,823
>> Jeff: TAI, DID YOU FEEL
THAT WHEN WE DID THE SWITCH?

817
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:02,743
>> DEFINITELY, AND AUTOMATICALLY
I THINK THE OTHER TRIBE MEMBER

818
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,955
WOULD THINK, THIS IS THREE
PERSON TO WATCH OUT FOR.

819
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,875
>> Jeff: AND CALEB, NOT ONLY
DID YOU PLAY TOGETHER, BUT YOU

820
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,042
AND TAI HAD A FRIENDSHIP.

821
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,421
DO YOU FEEL THAT PRESSURE, AS
WELL, THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING

822
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,589
ASSUMPTIONS?

823
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,049
>> YOU KNOW, YEAH, BUT THE
SIMPLE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T TART

824
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:21,220
THIS GAME TOGETHER, HE HAD
ALREADY BEEN WITH A WHOLE NEW

825
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,307
OTHER TRIBE FOR SEVEN DAY, SO
MAYBE IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO LOOK

826
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,516
DEEP INTO.

827
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,060
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER, IS THAT
FAIR THAT, YEAH, THERE MIGHT BE

828
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,772
A LITTLE SCRUTINY, BUT AS CALEB
SAYS, I DIDN'T EVEN START WITH

829
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,024
THESE GUYS.

830
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:37,236
>> I THINK WE'VE CONNECTED TAI
AND CALEB, BUT WE DID BOND, THE

831
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,281
OLD NUKU TRIBE PRETTY WELL, SO
MAYBE WE BRECK THAT BOND.

832
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,490
I DON'T KNOW.

833
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,743
>> Jeff: SIERRA, IT'S REALLY
INTERESTING, BECAUSE "SURVIVOR"

834
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,952
IS A GAME OF SOCIAL POLITICS.

835
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,789
WHEN YOU'RE ALL STRANGERS, THAT
HAS ONE MEANING, BUT THEN WHEN

836
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,126
YOU PLAY TOGETHER, THERE IS THIS
ADDED LAYER THAT YOU HAVE TO

837
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,920
DECIDE HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO I GIVE
IT.

838
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,672
>> I MEAN, YEAH, ALL THESE
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY WEREN'T

839
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,426
REALLY CONCERNED WITH CALEB AND
TAI, AND THAT WAS A HUGE CONCERN

840
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,470
OF MINE AND STILL IS.

841
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,431
SO I'M NOT BLINDED BY THE FACT I
KNOW THEY HAVE A FRIENDSHIP.

842
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,643
LIKE ME AND HALI, WE HAVE NO
RELATIONSHIP FROM OUR SEASON, SO

843
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,938
IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THAT CASE
RIGHT THERE.

844
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,856
>> Jeff: HALI, DO YOU FEEL,
THAT AS WELL?

845
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,318
>> WELL, WHEN THE TRIBES FIRST
SPLIT UP, YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT

846
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,322
ME AND CALEB MIGHT BE AT THE
BOTTOM NUMBERS-WISE, BUT IF YOU

847
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,366
LOOK CLOSER, MAYBE CALEB HAS
MORE ANGLES TO WORK IN THIS

848
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,493
TRIBE THAN I EVER COULD.

849
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,954
>> Jeff: BECAUSE OF PAST
RELATIONSHIPS?

850
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,080
>> EXACTLY.

851
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,831
>> Jeff: CALEB, DO YOU AGREE
WITH THAT, THAT BEING ON THE

852
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,709
WRONG SIDE OF THE NUMBERS AFTER
THE SWITCH, THAT IT'S YOU OR

853
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,627
HALEY?

854
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,796
>> FOR SURE, AND IT'S THEIR
DETERMINATION.

855
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,632
THEY EITHER WANT TO TAKE A
STRONG PLAYER THAT'S GOING TO BE

856
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,051
LOYAL, KICK BUTT IN CHALLENGES
AND GIVE THEM ALL THEY GOT,

857
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,471
WHICH IS ME, OR THEY'RE GOING TO
GO WITH HALI, WHICH PROBABLY IS

858
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:49,684
EASIER TO MANIPULATE AND
POSSIBLY A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO

859
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,685
TAKE ALONG.

860
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,894
>> Jeff: WOW.

861
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,189
HALI, WHAT'S IT LIKE TO HEAR YOU
REFERRED TO AS THE EASY ONE TO

862
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,190
GET RID OF TONIGHT?

863
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:58,317
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE SAID.

864
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:02,154
I THINK HE PUT HIMSELF OUT THERE
AS SOMEONE WHO IS

865
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,991
STRONGER-HEADED THAN ME AND A
BIGGER PLAYER IN THIS GAME AND

866
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,035
IN A GAME OF GAME CHANGERS, IS
THAT WHO YOU WANT AROUND?

867
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,580
>> CULPEPPER, SHE FLIPPED IT AND
SAID EVERYTHING CALEB JUST SAID

868
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,083
THAT MADE HIM VALUABLE IS WHAT
MAKES HIM A THREAT.

869
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,377
>> SHE'S A BUDDING ATTORNEY.

870
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,128
SHE'S DOING REALLY WELL.

871
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,546
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO
WEIGH.

872
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,091
WHAT PERSON IS REALLY GOING TO
MAKE THE TRIBE STRONGER IN OUR

873
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,175
NEXT CHALLENGE?

874
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,262
THEY BOTH BRING VALUE TO THE
TABLE, PHYSICAL, MENTAL.

875
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,388
IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION.

876
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:32,101
>> Jeff: TAI, THERE WERE SO
MANY ELEMENTS TO THIS GAME,

877
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,519
WHERE ARE YOU GIVING THE WEIGHT,
TO THE NEXT CHALLENGE, TO THE

878
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,729
MERGE, TO THE END?

879
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,149
>> I THINK I HAVE TO LOOK INTO
THE BIG PICTURE, NOT JUST THE

880
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,358
NEXT CHALLENGE.

881
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,403
I'M LOOKING AT LOYALTY, TRUST,
AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP, AS

882
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,070
WELL.

883
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,281
THE BIG PICTURE OF THE GAME.

884
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,533
>> Jeff: SO CALEB, WHEN YOU
HEAR THAT, DO YOU THINK THAT

885
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,743
MEANS YOU'RE STAYING?

886
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:53,789
>> YOU KNOW, JEFF, AGAIN, HALI
HAS HER ASSETS ABOUT HER, I HAVE

887
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,874
MINE.

888
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,625
I PEEVE THESE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT I
BRING TO THE TABLE.

889
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,545
THEY KNOW THE ASSET I AM TO THE
TRIBE.

890
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,381
AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE
RELATIONSHIPS ON THE OTHER SIDE

891
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:02,798
LIKE SHE DOES.

892
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,593
>> ARE YOU SURE?

893
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,429
I MEAN, I THINK THAT I'M A GOOD
PERSON TO TAKE FORWARD IN THE

894
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:13,768
GAME MORE THAN A BIG, STRONG
PLAYER IN A LOT OF MULTIPLE

895
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,019
DIMENSIONS.

896
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,147
SO BASICALLY MY CLOSING ARGUMENT
IS THAT I'VE JUST BEEN MYSELF

897
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,901
AND I INTEND TO CONTINUE THAT
WITH THESE PEOPLE, AND HOPEFULLY

898
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,570
THESE RELATIONSHIPS CAN TAKE US
PLACES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF

899
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:29,617
THE GAME.

900
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,118
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

901
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,620
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

902
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,704
HALI, YOU'RE UP.

903
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:30,302
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

904
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,139
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

905
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,725
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

906
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,685
OKAY.

907
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,104
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

908
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,857
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCILLARY

909
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,357
IMMEDIATELY.

910
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,195
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

911
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,365
FIRST VOTE CALEB.

912
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:54,702
HALI.

913
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,286
CALEB.

914
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,998
THAT'S TWO VOTES CALEB.

915
00:40:59,081 --> 00:40:59,582
CALEB.

916
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,749
THAT'S THREE VOTES CALEB.

917
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:05,087
ONE VOTE HALI.

918
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,840
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT, CALEB.

919
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,551
THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

920
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:21,562
>> GOOD LUCK.

921
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:29,069
>> Jeff: CALEB, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

922
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:39,747
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

923
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,792
WELL, EVERY TIME YOU VOTE
SOMEBODY OUT, YOU CHANGE THE

924
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,962
DYNAMICS OF THE TRIBE, AND THE
QUESTION IS ALWAYS THE SAME: WHO

925
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,757
DOES IT BENEFIT, WHO DOES IT
HURT?

926
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,719
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

927
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,803
GOOD NIGHT.

928
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,900
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

929
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:08,984
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

930
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:17,243
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," J.T. STARTS AN

931
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:17,785
UPRIDING.

932
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,786
>> SANDRA IS DANGEROUS.

933
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,621
I CAN DEFINITELY CHANGE THE
COURSE OF THIS GAME.

934
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,583
>> Jeff: AND THE TWISTS NEVER
STOP COMING.

935
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,002
LOSERS, BOTH TRIBES GO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

936
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:27,920
>> OH.

937
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,171
>> OH, OH, OH.

938
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,839
>> IT'S GOING TO BE FIREWORKS
TONIGHT.

939
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:31,966
>> OH, MY GOSH.

940
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:36,971
>> THE LAST TIME I PLAYED THIS
GAME, I WENT OUT DAY NINE.

941
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,099
AND THIS TIME, I'M GOING OUT DAY
NINE AGAIN.

942
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,977
LAST TIME I LEFT ON MY BACK IN A
HELICOPTER.

943
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,187
THIS TIME I'M WALKING OUT ON MY
FEET.

944
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,314
I'M MUCH HAPPIER ABOUT THAT.

945
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,650
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH TAI IS
GOING TO REMAIN.

946
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,444
I STILL LOVE HIM TO DEATH AND I
WISH HIM THE BEST OF LUCK MOVING

947
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,529
FORWARD.
