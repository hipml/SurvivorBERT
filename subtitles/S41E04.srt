225

acknowledged your efforts.

226

232
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,497
PROBST:
Danny, can you let yourself down

233
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,199
when you're trying to do
something you've never done

234
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,335
and have no expectation
to know how to do it?

235
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,004
Absolutely not. The only way
you can let yourself down

236
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,473
is if you don't give
100% effort, and she gave it.

237
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,776
And, Heather,
I just got to say, for me,

238
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,279
one of the reasons
I'm still here,

239
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,147
21 years later,

240
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,849
is because of moments like that.

241
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,651
I love the gameplay
of<i> Survivor,</i>

242
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,754

when somebody's vulnerable

243
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,522
and lets us watch

244
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,092
-and then is rewarded with love
from their competitors.
-Mm-hmm.

245
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,428
That's got to make you
feel a little better.

246
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,996
It does. It does.

247
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,698
All right, now let's get
to the victors.

248
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,101

for you back at camp.

You've been in last before.

762
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,901

<i>I've got to address that.</i>

765
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,243
I'm gonna act paranoid.
I'm gonna say to him, "JD,

766
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,878
"I feel like
you're working with Genie.

786
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,058
-That'd be dumb if I used it.
-So can you leave it here?

787
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,061

It's in my back pocket.

826
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,963

828
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,102
<i>I might never get</i>

829
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,903

Ah, good job.

833
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,144
And I don't want
to be a villain,

834
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,046

I'm-I'm playing from the bottom.

It's not a good day for me.

PROBST:
This is clearly a turning point
for this tribe.

851
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,441
I can feel it. I felt it
at the challenge when you lost.

852
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,643
So, Ricard, help the audience

853
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,512
understand what these moments
really feel like.

854
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,415
It's so weird,
going from audience member

855
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,017
to now being in this seat.

856
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,418
You know, you want
to pick off the people

857
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,320
that you hate when you're
watching them on the screen.

858
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,857
But with every vote out,
it genuinely hurts our feelings.

859
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,625
SHAN:
Yeah, we're bonding so that

860
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,360
we can survive the jungle.

861
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,630
Like, we're close,
we're farting on each other,

862
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,799
we're burping on each other,
and everybody does it.

863
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,201
-I don't care.
-I didn't do that.

864
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,069
SHAN:
Everybody lets a little gas go
at night.

865
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,804
-I hear it, okay, so...
-(laughing)

866
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,374
You know, and then it just
juxtaposes the reality of, like,

867
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,878
your life ends here, like,
this is the end of the road.

868
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,780
-So it's hard.
-PROBST: And, JD,

869
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,381
when you're watching at home,
it's easy.

870
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,784
You're sitting on your sofa,
bag of chips. You're like,

871
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,786
"I'd cut him, no problem.

872
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,921
Wouldn't have any emotion
at all."

873
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,757
Then you get out here--
to Shan's point-- not so easy.

874
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,426
JD:
Yeah. On the other hand,

875
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,895
leaning more on strategy,
what the viewer has

876
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,432
-that we don't all have
is information.
-There you go.

877
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,267
They know everything that's
going on-- who's lying to who--

878
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,202
and that's why I'm sitting
on the couch, being like,

879
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,438
"Malcolm,
what are you doing, bro?

880
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,106
-Like, they're coming for you."
-(Shan laughs)

881
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,208
PROBST:
So, Genie,
let's get back to you.

882
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,244
You walk in,
and the first thing you say is,

883
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,446
"I'm playing from the bottom."

884
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:52,116
I mean, the last Tribal, I was
just as blindsided as-as Brad.

885
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,119
So, you know you're on
the bottom of the tribe.

886
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,088
Because you didn't have
the information.

887
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,155
I didn't have the information,

888
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,490
and nobody wanted
to give it to me.

889
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,893
And-and... and I was
really thinking

890
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,094
we were gonna win
that immunity challenge

891
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,363
because we got a lot
of energy from that.

892
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,365
The fish and-and all these
things that we were taught

893
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,334
by the awesome Nathan. You know,
oh, my God, that guy is amazing.

894
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,737
And then this happens,
and now I'm scrambling.

895
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,405
I mean,
people are making me promises,

896
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,208
but how am I supposed
to really believe them?

897
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,442
-You know what I mean? Like...
-It's tough.

898
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,679
-Uh, yeah, it's freaking tough.
-So, Ricard,

899
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,548
with four people,
it's two-two or three-one.

900
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,616
And two-two would mean

901
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,419
that there are two pairs
that are locked in.

902
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,589
-Is that a possibility?
-I think it is a possibility.

903
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,025
I hope that's not the case.
I believe

904
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,626
that's not the case,
but anything is possible.

905
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,429
I don't believe it, Jeff.
It's gonna be three-one on me.

906
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,432
I think they're just trying
to appease me right now

907
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,634
or whatever, so I don't roll
this Shot in the Dark.

908
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,636
It's another new element
to the game

909
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,706
-that can cause a lot of havoc.
-Absolutely. Exactly.

910
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,709
This is the only thing I have
that-that I feel like I can take

911
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,711
-in my own hands.
-I respect that play.

912
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:57,148
Just keep in mind, when you use
your Shot in the Dark,

913
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:59,050
you lose your vote,

914
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,885
and that potentially
could be messing up somebody

915
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,720
who is willing
to work with you.

916
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:06,657
Just make sure
we all do what we said

917
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,893
we were going to do.

918
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,396
PROBST:
Wow.

919
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,833
That is a complicated statement
JD just said.

920
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,335
Does that change how you feel,

921
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,303
or would you reveal it
if it did?

922
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,840
I'll probably make that decision
when I'm in there.

923
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,610
JD, I can feel the tension.

924
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,278
-Yeah.
-Even though
I've seen you at Tribal

925
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,114
-enough, tonight is different.
-JD: Yeah.

926
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,516
I felt like
I had to do scrambling,

927
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,752
and I think Ricard felt like
he had to do some scrambling.

928
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,487
My name's been written down.

929
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,357
-Genie.
-Yeah, my name's been
written down, Genie.

930
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,093
You know, so... just as much
as I don't want to go home,

931
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,661
these three people don't want

932
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,262
-to go home, either.
-Nobody wants to go home.

933
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,467
So, Shan, what's the worst part
of going home?

934
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,003
Not getting to the place
in the game where you wanted to.

935
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,105
You know, as much
as we're all visualizing

936
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,840
sitting in the final three,

937
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,109
grabbing that check
from you, um,

938
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,877
17 people are just not going
to get that.

939
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,545
17 people are going
to be disappointed.

940
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,281
If you get there,
you've killed a lot of dreams,

941
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,050
and if you don't,
then you've killed your own.

942
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,785
JD:
And the worst part of going home

943
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:11,155
for me would be this idea
that I built up in my head,

944
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,959
growing up, that I was going to
be some amazing<i> Survivor</i> player.

945
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,894
And I'll-I'll be honest.
I have not played the game

946
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,896
that I imagined myself playing.

947
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,731
I checked off a lot of boxes,

948
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,933
but the list is so long,

949
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,069
there's so many boxes
that I still want to check.

950
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,073
And, JD, regardless, how long
you last, you don't really

951
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,975
know what this journey
is going to be about

952
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,777
-until you get some perspective.
-Yeah.

953
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,179
I'm just not ready
for the perspective yet.

954
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,614
I'm not ready
to see the perspective.

955
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,783
I need to... I need
to do some more stuff out here.

956
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,351
Then I'll reflect.

957
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,286
In other words, "Probst,
enough with the therapy."

958
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,322
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-PROBST: So, Genie,

959
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,124
we started with you.
Let's end with you.

960
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,294
If it's you tonight,
what will you miss?

961
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,964
I mean, I'm going to miss
everything about this, but...

962
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,766
I have to say, I think
I'm actually gonna...

963
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,002
I'm gonna miss these guys.

964
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,739
Oh, Genie.

965
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,774
Does the emotion surprise you?

966
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,177
GENIE:
I mean, not really.

967
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,112
It's just, you know, you...

968
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,848
We're just... we're just beaten
down to, like, our bare bones

969
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,383
and just the emotions.

970
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,785
It just comes out
at any time, so...

971
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,521
I mean,
a lot of it is exhaustion,

972
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:21,459
and a lot of it is because
I truly believe we bonded.

973
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,694
This game is hard, and we...

974
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,296
-It's not supposed to be easy.
-Oh.

975
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:27,131
