"Oh, my God, you're so fine.
Everything is good."

00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:57,344

00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:58,379
Yeah.

307
00:12:58,482 --> 00:12:59,758
So Brando was a tough vote.

308
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,275
Um, I'm sorry. I know
that you guys were close.

309

I think both Bruce
and I can move forward.

310
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:05,896
But just because
we can move forward

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,344
from the comments on the barge

312
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:08,586
doesn't mean we can
move forward in an alliance.

313
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,137
You know, we hug and we move on,

314
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:13,517
but in the game ofSurvivor,
it's about understanding

315
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,275
if we can trust one
another moving forward,

316
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,758
and we don't hold grudges.

317
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:21,344
There was an option
to choose food or strategy.

318
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,931
-I wanted food so friggin' bad.
I was going for food.
-Yeah, we figured...

319
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,965
And J. was the one
who wanted strategy the most.

320
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:29,448
-Really?
-Basically
we each have an amulet.

321
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:32,344
Ever since losing
that sandwich at the journey,

322
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,724
I've been just wanting revenge.

323
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:36,551
Like, I wanted
only those sandwiches

324
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,137
and nothing else in this world.

325
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,896
But J. was adamant
on these amulets.

326
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,241
I need people to know

327
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,241
that I'm pissed at those two,
that I want

328
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:46,172
them two out. If they're out,
it's better for me

329
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:47,482
and I finally get revenge

330
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:49,413
on losing my sandwiches.

331
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:51,724
The only issue is
it can upgrade.

332
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,275
So if one of
the three gets voted out,

333
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:54,931
it gets turned
into a Steal a Vote.

342
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:14,586
we need to bring in the numbers,

343
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,413

to find a common enemy

-It has to be J.
-J. first?

J. could be a good option,

that Reba has six,

that we're not six strong.

J. has been on the bottom,

511
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,206
You get to walk around
and talk to whoever it is

512
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,310

because it's just you and Emily.

Bruce is mad at me

514
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:40,793
for having conversations
with people who aren't Belo.

515
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:42,137
It was like

516
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,344
I was a guy
who got pulled over by a cop,

517
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:46,344
getting shaken down
for every piece of information

518
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:48,724
and telling me how wrong I was,
when I didn't even do anything.

519
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:51,137
If you want the original Belo
to do their thing

520
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:52,931
together with you, then

521
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,862
you have to seriously
do some damage control.

522
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:56,862
-Okay.
-And that's gonna help me,
it's gonna help you,

523
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,448
it's gonna help Belo,
and we're gonna go from there.

524
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,310
We're gonna pull one person in.

He has a very archaic way
of looking at the game.

526

He wants us
to not talk to the enemy.

527
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:08,000
And I think that's the stupidest
thing ever, you know?

528
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:09,620
I appreciate what you're saying.

Nobody's talking to me.

It's that simple.

not happy with you.

we gonna tell the other side?"

It seems like he really,
truly cannot help himself.

548
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:50,517
And everyone on Belo is annoyed
with him. He has an idol,

549
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,275
which makes him scary.

00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:44,034
PROBST: This is it.
Winners move on to the merge,

844
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:46,103
will have a merge meal
and get that Buff,

845
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:48,896
immunity at tonight's
Tribal Council.

846
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,241
Kendra ripping
through it quickly

847
00:33:51,344 --> 00:33:52,793
with another piece and another.

848
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,172
She thinks she knows the phrase.

849
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:58,862
Red is gonna have
to get something going fast.

850
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:01,413
Jake, this one. This one.
Jake, this one.

851
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:02,827
DREW:
Wait. "Safe."

852
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:05,241
PROBST: Kendra gonna take pieces
out, start again.

853
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,310
-The door is open for Red.
-DREW: Safely.

854
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:09,655
PROBST:
You got to keep digging.

855
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,688
-Come on, come on, come on.
-PROBST: Red with another piece.

856
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:14,103
Kellie hefting another piece.

857
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:17,413
Julie and Kendra are gonna
try something different.

858
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:19,413
-Okay.
-PROBST: Say it.

859
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,137
-And you are.
-[yelling]

860
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:27,827
Katurah picked the right six.

861
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:29,551
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.

862
00:34:29,655 --> 00:34:33,137
They will move on
and enjoy it with a merge meal.

863
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:35,241
Different result
at the other end.

864
00:34:35,344 --> 00:34:38,585
Big effort, came up short.
Somebody going home tonight.

865
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:42,827
No food, no Buff, no security.

866
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,551
-Blue, congratulations.
-KENDRA: Thank you so much.

867
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:51,344
Here are your Buffs.
Katurah, here's yours.

868
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:53,103
Open it up and put 'em on.

869
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:54,965
-You earned 'em.
-KENDRA: Yes.

870
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:58,000
Sifu, Bruce, Kendra,
Drew, Julie,

871
00:34:58,103 --> 00:35:01,379
Katurah and Austin, you have
successfully transitioned

872
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:03,379
into the next phase of the game.

873
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:06,344
You are now part
of the merged tribe.

874
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:09,172
It's awesome.

875
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:10,689
PROBST: All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

876
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:13,620
Tonight at Tribal Council,
you can't be voted out.

877
00:35:13,724 --> 00:35:17,344
You will still cast a vote
and decide who goes home.

878
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,896
This afternoon, you're gonna
head to the sanctuary,

879
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,344
where good things happen.

880
00:35:22,448 --> 00:35:26,137
Your first real proper food
in 13 days.

881
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,862
Well earned.

882
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:30,206
On the other end,
look at the difference,

883
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,793
these faces.

884
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,586
Kaleb, what do you do
in a situation like this,

885
00:35:34,689 --> 00:35:37,275
where there isn't anything
to do other than accept it?

886
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:39,793
Yeah, I'm actually
weirdly at peace.

887
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:41,931
We lost, and it sucks.

888
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:44,724
But I've been losing a lot out
here, as well, along with Emily.

889
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:46,724
We fought as hard as we could,

890
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:48,620
and so, we go back,
and we play the game.

891
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:50,448
-That's all you can do
at this point.
-PROBST: All right,

892
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:53,137
Kaleb, J., Jake, Kellie, Emily,

893
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,241
and Dee,
you're gonna go back to camp,

894
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:57,137
try to figure out
what you need to do

895
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,655
to make sure it's not you

896
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:01,310
who is the sixth person
voted out of Survivor45.

897
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:02,896
Grab your stuff, head out.

898
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,482
See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

899
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:08,655
-Good effort, guys.
-You guys rock.
-PROBST: All right,

900
00:36:08,758 --> 00:36:10,965
-head out,
head to the sanctuary.
-[yelling]

901
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,724
-Yes!
-PROBST:
Enjoy your well-earned meal.

902
00:36:12,827 --> 00:36:15,000
You rock, man.

903
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:17,724
-Yourock.
You literally just rocked it.
-[Sifu laughs]

904
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:19,379
Yeah.

905
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:21,172
JULIE: I feel terrible

906
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:24,655
that six are starving
and not safe, but

907
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:29,000
being safe tonight... is huge.

908
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,620
If you do the numbers,

909
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:34,172
the seven at the feast
can decide who goes home.

910
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,034
Who's gonna risk
throwing out a name?

911
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:45,172
KENDRA: To making the merge,

912
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:47,586
Survivor45, let's get it!

913
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,482
[whooping]

914
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:51,275
[shouting]:
Blue.

915
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:53,482
-[whooping, cheering]
-Let's go!

916
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,620
KATURAH:
We're eating for the first time

917
00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:58,000
in 13 days. What the hell?

918
00:36:58,103 --> 00:37:00,137
DREW: The challenge today
was the singular

919
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:03,310
most important challenge
in this game, because not only

920
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:05,793
do you win a Buff, you have
made the merge, officially,

921
00:37:05,896 --> 00:37:09,655
and you are then
awarded a feast.

922
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:12,103
-Oh, my God. Butter.
-KENDRA: I friggin' love butter.

923
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:14,482
-I would make love to it.
-[laughs]

924
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:15,827
DREW:
That food empowered me

925
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,448
physically and strategically,

926
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:19,517
because when you go
to that merge feast,

927
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,620
everyone's guard
is on the floor.

928
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:23,068
-Ah. [whoops]
-KATURAH: Yeah.

929
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:24,344
DREW: Everyone wants
to talk to one another.

930
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:26,758
Everyone is open
to working with another.

931
00:37:26,862 --> 00:37:28,724
We all know we're safe.
None of us can be targets.

932
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:30,862
We should talk a little bit
about the vote tonight.

933
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:32,827
Open the floor.
What do you got?

934
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:34,896
SIFU:
I will put this out there.

935
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,586
J. is top of my list right now.

936
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,103
KATURAH:
J.? Okay.

937
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:40,137
DREW:
There is no love
for J. here, and

938
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:42,310
I think I would be fine
with that decision.

939
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:45,172
So y'all don't have, like,
a deep connection to J.?

940
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:46,655
JULIE:
She wrote Sifu's name down.

941
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:48,103
KATURAH:
Oh, really?

942
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:50,068
I think she's literally
just trying to slither up

943
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:51,965
and trying
to cut people's throats.

944
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:53,862
JULIE: Sifu thinks
that J. wrote his name down,

945
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:56,344
so he's, for sure,
ready to let her go.

946
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:59,172
What he doesn't know is
that Dee wrote his name down.

947
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:02,137
But I'm fine
with J. going home tonight,

948
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:04,241
because I do feel like she'd
cut me if she had the chance.

949
00:38:04,344 --> 00:38:05,793
Here's just a thought.

950
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:09,172
Kaleb and Emily are the only two
left from Lulu, right?

951
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:11,034
-AUSTIN: Yeah.
-KENDRA: In my mind,

952
00:38:11,137 --> 00:38:12,482
Kaleb is a dangerous player,

953
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:15,137
and from the beginning,
I've had my eye on him.

954
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,655
That's just where I stand.

955
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,620
KATURAH:
The only thing I'm thinking is

956
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:21,206
Emily is kind of
not connected to Reba,

957
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,068
not really connected to Belo.

958
00:38:23,172 --> 00:38:25,241
She's a safe vote in the middle.

959
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,827
He's a threat in this game.
Like, he's talking to everyone.

960
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,310
Like, he's great at challenges.

961
00:38:31,413 --> 00:38:33,517
Yes. I've seen a lot
of gameplay by Kaleb.

962
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,620
Being, like, social,
Kaleb, you know, it's time.

963
00:38:37,724 --> 00:38:39,413
KENDRA:
I 100% agree with you.

964
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,620
-Really? Okay.
-SIFU: He's a player.

965
00:38:42,724 --> 00:38:44,586
I thought all Belo
is working with Kaleb.

966
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:48,482
So why the heck are Kendra
and Bruce over there saying,

967
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:49,896
"Oh, yeah, Kaleb's got to go"?

968
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,689
I like the guy,
but I see it. I see it.

969
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:55,758
KATURAH:
We like him. We trust him.
We want him.

970
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:57,103
He's a clear number for us.

971
00:38:57,206 --> 00:38:58,620
So I don't want
to get rid of Kaleb.

972
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:00,206
They're just
blowing up the whole game.

973
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,655
Their strategy is all messed up.

974
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,758
-[whooping]
-KATURAH: Happy merge, baby!

975
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:11,103
EMILY:
Oh, my God. I am so disgusting!

976
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:14,241
KALEB:
Yeah. You got dirt
on your, like, neck and stuff.

977
00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:16,103
KELLIE:
Oh, my God.

978
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:22,586
JAKE:
That immunity challenge
was tough, man.

979
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:24,068
That kicked my ass.

980
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:25,931
I am freaking out.

981
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:28,413
I haven't been
to Tribal yet, so,

982
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:30,206
if I could describe the feeling
right now in one utterance,

983
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,379
it's, "Aah!" [laughs]

984
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:34,241
No. You got
to teach me your ways, man.

985
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:35,724
-You survived
a couple of these.
-Yeah.

986
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:37,103
-I need to take some lessons.
-Yeah.

987
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:38,448
JAKE:
Yeah, I'm scared.

988
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:40,551
I need to save my ass tonight.

989
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:42,103
I'm gonna be here tomorrow, J.
I want you to be here tomorrow.

990
00:39:42,206 --> 00:39:43,448
-You know what I mean?
-I want you to be...

991
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:44,758
I want us both
to be here tomorrow.

992
00:39:44,862 --> 00:39:46,137
-Yeah, yeah.
-And so,

993
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:47,724
I think a Lulu
should go home tonight.

994
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:50,206
It's either Emily or Kaleb.

995
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,000
I-I do like Kaleb.

996
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:54,344
-Kaleb, would...
-I like him a lot,
but he's a physical threat.

997
00:39:54,448 --> 00:39:56,206
-He is.
-He's a social threat.

998
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,655
Physical, social. Yeah.
No, he is.

999
00:39:58,758 --> 00:40:01,862
J. MAYA:
Kaleb has been
the smile-iest guy onSurvivor.

1000
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:03,448
He's working really hard

1001
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:06,482
to charm everyone
that he speaks to.

1002
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:08,172
That kind of puts you
on high alert.

1003
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,517
So I bring up

1004
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,620
Kaleb's name,
because in my head,

1005
00:40:11,724 --> 00:40:13,379
I think that
he's a good, safe vote.

1006
00:40:13,482 --> 00:40:15,965
-I think it's good to project
Reba strong right now.
-Yeah.

1007
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:17,310
Because people are scared of us.

1008
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:19,068
-Yeah.
-And they should be.

1009
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:22,931
Obviously, I do know that my
Reba Tribemates have my back.

1010
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,586
We have the numbers on Reba, so,
that's how tonight's gonna go.

1011
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,896
If you had to choose someone,
who would you choose?

1012
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,413
My trepidation--
and, like, I don't know

1013
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:31,862
-if you feel the same way--
is throwing out a name.
-Yeah.

1014
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:33,482
Can't give all, like,
the cards away, and, like,

1015
00:40:33,586 --> 00:40:35,379
-I know you get that, you know?
-Right, right. Okay, look,

1016
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:37,137
I'm a bit more open,
I think, than you are.

1017
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:38,724
I'll tell you the name
that I want.

1018
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:40,931
-Okay.
-J.

1019
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:43,068
-Like, I'm, like,
shocked by that, but, um...
-Yeah.

1020
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:45,344
-I know,
'cause it's Reba, but...
-What you...

1021
00:40:45,448 --> 00:40:47,551
What you tell me to do,
I'm down with, man.

1022
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,862
DEE:
Voting off J.--
it's not gonna burn bridges

1023
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:52,896
between Reba, Belo and Lulu,
and J. wasn't really part of

1024
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,482
our Reba alliance
with the four of us.

1025
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,034
So, sorry, J., but

1026
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:58,413
whatever. It's gonna be over,

1027
00:40:58,517 --> 00:41:00,344
and we're gonna
forgive each other.

1028
00:41:00,448 --> 00:41:01,862
I wouldn't mind
writing her name down.

1029
00:41:01,965 --> 00:41:03,310
KALEB:
I'm a little bit surprised.

1030
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:04,862
-Yeah.
-'Cause I just thought, like,

1031
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:06,344
it sounded like
the girls were so close.

1032
00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:08,068
I mean,
she'll be surprised, too.

1033
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:09,586
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1034
00:41:09,689 --> 00:41:12,068
-Dee told me she wants J. gone.
-KELLIE: What?

1035
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:13,655
No.

1036
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:15,689
She said I didn't, like...

1037
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:18,103
-So there's a lot
of animosity with J.
-So... Yes.

1038
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:20,000
KELLIE: This is perfect for me,
because if you take out J.,

1039
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,655
you're knocking down these sort
of traditional Reba numbers.

1040
00:41:23,758 --> 00:41:25,965
And the other benefit is
if we do vote her out, now

1041
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,172
me and Austin have upgraded
the level of our amulet.

1042
00:41:28,275 --> 00:41:29,896
EMILY:
I feel really bad
for her because

1043
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,137
-I think she's so lovely,
and she's so kind.
-She's lovely.

1044
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:35,068
But it's survival right now.
Yeah, that's how I feel.

1045
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:37,931
But at this stage of the game,
there are so many people.

1046
00:41:38,034 --> 00:41:39,241
It's very difficult to say,

1047
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:40,620
"This is where
everybody stands."

1048
00:41:40,724 --> 00:41:42,103
Because people had a decision

1049
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:43,517
at the merge feast among people

1050
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,827
who would probably
never work together.

1051
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:46,517
Like, it was
a hodgepodgey group.

1052
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,758
Oh, look at these full bellies

1053
00:41:47,862 --> 00:41:49,551
-coming up here! Geez.
-They're back!

1054
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:51,034
KELLIE:
Would they ever have really

1055
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:52,517
all gotten together--
all seven of them--

1056
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,137
and come to some consensus
decision? No friggin' way.

1057
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:58,000
How the heck do I know
what's really gonna happen?

1058
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:04,068
[whooping]

1059
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:06,344
Some good waves right now.

1060
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:10,655
[indistinct chatter]

1061
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:13,724
We're like,
"Hey, come on back up.

1062
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:15,724
-Let's get you talking."
-"We're just waiting." Exactly.

1063
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:18,586
JAKE:
Yeah, yeah. No, we're just
waiting. ♪ Sitting around ♪

1064
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:21,137
-♪ Couple of sitting ducks,
quacking. ♪
-I am ready.

1065
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:25,275
I hate them. [laughing]

1066
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:26,655
[laughing]

1067
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:27,965
KALEB:
Loserville-- population six.

1068
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:29,827
As they go wash off their mud,

1069
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,793
we're sitting there
in the shelter

1070
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:33,413
like cattle, just wondering
which one of us is gonna

1071
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,896
get picked next.

1072
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,241
They have all of this power.

1073
00:42:37,344 --> 00:42:39,137
They want,
from that seven of us,

1074
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:41,275
-J. and Kaleb.
-KELLIE: Okay. Yeah.

1075
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:43,103
-So who are y'all thinking?
-J.

1076
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:44,620
-Okay, so we're all good on J.?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1077
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:46,000
And the good news is,
the Reba folks are fine with J.

1078
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:47,448
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1079
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:49,379
KATURAH: The only other name
that they want is Kaleb.

1080
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:51,724
He's been on my radar
from the beginning.

1081
00:42:51,827 --> 00:42:53,413
I don't want us
to lose Kaleb just yet.

1082
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:55,344
Kaleb is, like,
Belo strong right now.

1083
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,206
What we need
is a Reba girl to go home.

1084
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,275
I actually...
I do agree with that.

1085
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:01,068
-KATURAH: Yeah.
-KENDRA: Okay.

1086
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:02,724
Well, Bruce
made it seem different

1087
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:04,275
-to me.
-Yeah, that's it.

1088
00:43:12,448 --> 00:43:13,965
-We can't, like... It...
-I'm not.

1089
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:16,241
-Okay. Right.
-As part of the plan,
I'm voting J.

1090
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,448
-My vote will say
J. tonight, 100%.
-Okay.

1091
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:21,137
Katurah doesn't want
to vote Kaleb.

1092
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:22,482
Kaleb-- he's dangerous.

1093
00:43:22,586 --> 00:43:24,310
I see little butterflies
flying around.

1094
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:26,310
That's what he's doing.

1095
00:43:26,413 --> 00:43:29,172
With his smile,
his little, you know?

1096
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:31,586
Kaleb can bounce around
like little butterflies.

1097
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,965
We got to watch out for this
dude because he's conniving.

1098
00:43:34,965 --> 00:43:36,896
Over J.?

1099
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,034
BRUCE:
Kaleb is bouncing
back and forth.

1100
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:39,655
I don't want that in my way.

1101
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:41,896
Sorry. You got to go.

1102
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,689
Reba, Belo, Lulu.
[blows raspberry] I don't care.

1103
00:43:44,793 --> 00:43:46,586
Tribal lines are gone.

1104
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,172
Oh, all day. All day.

1105
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:51,310
-Yeah, I'm sure you know.
-Yup.

1106
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:52,827
And I think
that makes a lot of sense.

1107
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:54,241
-All right, there you go.
-Okay.

1108
00:43:54,344 --> 00:43:55,931
DREW: Bruce opens and says,

1109
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:58,034
"Kaleb is the right pick."
I am elated

1110
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,413
because my fear
in voting Kaleb was

1111
00:44:00,517 --> 00:44:02,379
you could be kicking
the Belo hornet's nest,

1112
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:03,827
and they could all
come right after you stinging.

1113
00:44:03,931 --> 00:44:05,275
But now,

1114
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:06,586
I can kick the hornet's nest
all day.

1115
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:08,000
They're out to lunch.

1116
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,517
You know, they're with me.
They don't care.

1117
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,724
Right now, Bruce
is feeling very vulnerable.

1118
00:44:14,482 --> 00:44:16,655
I want J. gone.
[laughs, mumbles]

1119
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:19,068
AUSTIN:
She took my sandwich,
so I don't mind her going.

1120
00:44:19,172 --> 00:44:20,586
DREW:
If we can keep the Rebas,

1121
00:44:20,689 --> 00:44:22,931
especially one who has nowhere
else to go, that helps us

1122
00:44:23,034 --> 00:44:25,241
in the long run.
It's numbers. Okay.

1123
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:28,310
-I feel like we shouldn't split.
-No, I don't think so.

1124
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:30,827
I think we go in there,
and we vote 100% on Kaleb.

1125
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:32,620
AUSTIN:
I absolutely want J. out.

1126
00:44:32,724 --> 00:44:34,379
She prevented me
from getting a sandwich,

1127
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:37,517
and ever since then,
I've had it out for her.

1128
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,034
But getting rid of J., we are
kind of sacrificing a number.

1129
00:44:43,103 --> 00:44:44,344
I got all your backs.

1130
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,275
AUSTIN:
I think what makes sense most

1131
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:46,896
is to get rid of Kaleb.

1132
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:49,724
Yeah.

1133
00:44:49,827 --> 00:44:52,517
AUSTIN:
We need the blindside of Kaleb,
and the more votes

1134
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,931
that are going to him,
the easier it is for me

1135
00:44:55,034 --> 00:44:57,793
to sacrifice my vote again
to upgrade my idol.

1136
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:00,137
Uh, so we're
kind of thinking Kaleb.

1137
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:01,827
DEE:
Are we splitting it?

1138
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:05,172
AUSTIN:
No. So we have
to all vote Kaleb.

1139
00:45:05,275 --> 00:45:06,931
EMILY:
The moment I heard

1140
00:45:07,034 --> 00:45:08,689
that all the votes are basically
switching to Kaleb,

1141
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,034
my heart sunk.

1142
00:45:10,137 --> 00:45:11,379
I don't want to send out Kaleb.

1143
00:45:11,482 --> 00:45:12,724
That is me

1144
00:45:12,827 --> 00:45:14,586
sacrificing a significant
portion of my game,

1145
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:16,068
because moving forward,

1146
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,482
I've lost what is effectively
my number one ally.

1147
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:19,241
AUSTIN: I do feel like
there's enough momentum

1148
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:21,379
-behind it at this point.
-DEE: Yeah. Yeah, I do, too.

1149
00:45:21,482 --> 00:45:23,931
EMILY:
I'm between a rock
and a hard place.

1150
00:45:24,034 --> 00:45:25,275
I need
to keep up my relationships

1151
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:26,655
with the old Reba tribe.

1152
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:28,689
So if I fight too hard,
then they see me

1153
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:32,275
as showing my true alliances
to Kaleb as opposed to them.

1154
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:39,172
It is exactly the way
Survivorworks.

1155
00:45:39,275 --> 00:45:41,448
Kaleb has saved my butt
in the past, so, I just...

1156
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:43,103
I need him here.
I need him here,

1157
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:44,758
and I need to convince people
that they need him here, too.

1158
00:45:44,862 --> 00:45:47,482
But it might be out of
my control, when voting against

1159
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:49,241
what the majority is doing
puts a target on my back

1160
00:45:49,344 --> 00:45:51,172
even more so
than I already have.

1161
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:55,068
-AUSTIN: Yeah?
-Shot in the Dark,

1162
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:56,620
actually, I didn't think about.

1163
00:45:56,724 --> 00:45:58,413
We just have to convince him
that it's not him.

1164
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:03,586
Yeah, just reiterate
like, it's okay. Yeah.

1165
00:46:03,689 --> 00:46:05,068
-J. MAYA: Yeah. Yeah.
-AUSTIN: Cool.

1166
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,517
Pretty, pretty strongly
against you.

1167
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,241
Like, Shot-in-the-Dark level
against you.

1168
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:14,758
I want you to have the chance
to try to save yourself somehow.

1169
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:16,793
-So what about Bruce?
-Bruce is voting for you, 100%.

1170
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:18,965
-He doesn't like you at all.
Sorry.
-Yeah.

1171
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,965
I came out here
to play a strategic game.

1172
00:46:22,068 --> 00:46:24,000
I was gonna try
and lower my threat level.

1173
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:26,068
And they're coming after me. Of
course they're coming after me.

1174
00:46:26,172 --> 00:46:27,689
And I'm doing everything I can
to stop it.

1175
00:46:28,689 --> 00:46:30,034
JAKE: Yeah.

1176
00:46:30,137 --> 00:46:31,724
-JAKE: Okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

1177
00:46:31,827 --> 00:46:33,344
Bruce does have an idol.

1178
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:35,620
-You're kidding.
-Yeah, he has it.

1179
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:36,793
KALEB:
So what do I do?

1180
00:46:36,896 --> 00:46:38,068
"Guess what? Bruce has an idol,

1181
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:39,275
"and I'm not working with him.

1182
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,482
"I'm not working
with any of Belo.

1183
00:46:40,586 --> 00:46:41,965
I want to work with you guys."

1184
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:44,137
And I'm trying to rally Rebas
to get rid of J.

1185
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:46,275
-Will you guys do this with me?
-Yeah.
-[overlapping chatter]

1186
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:48,758
And I swear to you guys,
I'm ten toes down at this.

1187
00:46:48,862 --> 00:46:50,965
-This is exciting!
-KALEB: Okay.

1188
00:46:51,068 --> 00:46:54,551
What we had back
at that Lulu beach-- it's done.

1189
00:46:54,655 --> 00:46:56,103
You go with the masses.

1190
00:46:56,206 --> 00:46:57,965
We have to vote for Kaleb.

1191
00:46:58,068 --> 00:46:59,344
Is there anything else
you feel like

1192
00:46:59,448 --> 00:47:00,758
would really work
with these people?

1193
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:02,551
Selling myself
and selling my case

1194
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,655
is not something
I'm unfamiliar with in sales.

1195
00:47:04,758 --> 00:47:05,965
However,

1196
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:07,517
people can sense desperation,

1197
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,275
and I am bleeding
at this point with it.

1198
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:11,827
I feel like
I'm about to throw up.

1199
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:14,862
[babbles]

1200
00:47:15,896 --> 00:47:18,241
KALEB:
My life is completely
on the line.

1201
00:47:18,344 --> 00:47:19,586
We'll see what happens.

1202
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:21,413
Gonna be okay.

1203
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:22,724
KALEB:
I have to hope
that the numbers go my way.

1204
00:47:22,827 --> 00:47:24,724
I need a group to work with.

1205
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:26,034
You can't run through this game
by yourself

1206
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:27,448
like a vigilante. That's--

1207
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:29,137
I'm not Batman, you know.
I'm Kaleb.

1208
00:47:29,241 --> 00:47:31,103
I'm-I'm the Canadian. [laughs]

1209

♪ ♪

1210
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,827
If this is your first time
at Tribal Council,

1211
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:01,551
grab a torch
that does not have fire,

1212
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:04,275
dip it in and get fire.

1213
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:07,068
♪ ♪

1214
00:48:10,413 --> 00:48:13,310
This is part of the ritual
of Tribal Council, because,

1215
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:17,137
in this game,
fire does represent your life.

1216
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:20,275
And it is crazy
to be saying that on day 13.

1217
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:21,758
So let's talk about it.

1218
00:48:21,862 --> 00:48:23,758
Drew, let's go back
to yesterday.

1219
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:27,275
13 people together
for the first time.

1220
00:48:27,379 --> 00:48:30,034
What goes down? Is there a lot
of sharing of stories?

1221
00:48:30,137 --> 00:48:32,310
Sharing of any
and all kind, Jeff.

1222
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:34,034
It's too much sharing
for my taste.

1223
00:48:34,137 --> 00:48:35,793
I mean, I felt like the nerd

1224
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:37,551
who accidentally
walked into the frat party.

1225
00:48:37,655 --> 00:48:38,862
Like, everyone
is so extroverted.

1226
00:48:38,965 --> 00:48:40,620
Everyone's so outgoing.

1227
00:48:40,724 --> 00:48:42,448
But you have
to straddle a line, because

1228
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:44,241
am I still, you know, Belo?
Am I still Reba?

1229
00:48:44,344 --> 00:48:47,172
Am I still Lulu?
It's not quite clear.

1230
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:50,965
And so, that uncertainty
is a big thing to chew off.

1231
00:48:51,068 --> 00:48:53,344
PROBST:
Emily, what about
first impressions?

1232
00:48:53,448 --> 00:48:55,137
Now, I'm thinking
specifically of you and Bruce

1233
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:57,068
on the first day.

1234
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:58,862
-Anything change?
-EMILY: Oh, yeah. No,

1235
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:01,241
we had an opportunity
to talk about it.

1236
00:49:01,344 --> 00:49:02,931
-I think we squashed any beef.
-Amen.

1237
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:04,482
Uh, we'll see if he writes
my name down tonight.

1238
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:06,172
[laughing]

1239
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:09,758
J., is it hard to separate,

1240
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:11,482
"Oh, my gosh, I want
to get to know these people,"

1241
00:49:11,586 --> 00:49:14,000
versus, "Oh, my gosh, I need

1242
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:16,275
to get to know these people
in a certain way"?

1243
00:49:16,379 --> 00:49:19,275
A hundred percent. I mean,
yesterday was overwhelming.

1244
00:49:19,379 --> 00:49:22,000
I've been with Reba members,
essentially, from the beginning

1245
00:49:22,103 --> 00:49:23,689
of this game, and then suddenly,
you have to decide

1246
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:26,034
quickly who you vibe with,

1247
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,965
who you read well,
and then you have

1248
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:29,103
a ton of time,
and then suddenly,

1249
00:49:29,206 --> 00:49:30,586
you have no time at all.

1250
00:49:30,689 --> 00:49:33,448
Sifu, did you find
that same thing-- that you were

1251
00:49:33,551 --> 00:49:35,551
quickly running out of time
and starting to scramble?

1252
00:49:35,655 --> 00:49:37,551
Yeah, I don't know
who coined it,

1253
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:39,310
but we had office hours today,

1254
00:49:39,413 --> 00:49:42,034
where we're checking in.
You might be

1255
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:43,827
9:00 to 5:00,
you might be 7:00 to 3:00.

1256
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:45,344
KENDRA:
Oh, yeah.

1257
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:47,344
I had to close my office hours

1258
00:49:47,448 --> 00:49:49,344
because you have 12 voices.

1259
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:51,655
I have my own voices
in my head.

1260
00:49:51,758 --> 00:49:53,068
They're like, "We're having
a party over here."

1261
00:49:53,172 --> 00:49:55,310
JULIE:
However,

1262
00:49:55,413 --> 00:49:58,206
-there were a lot
of non-office hours.
-Mm-hmm.

1263
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,655
-"So, hey."
-People knocking.
-I'm...

1264
00:50:00,758 --> 00:50:03,241
KATURAH:
I want overtime.
I want overtime.

1265
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:04,310
-Yeah.
-EMILY: Can I build off of that?

1266
00:50:04,413 --> 00:50:05,517
Because I don't feel like

1267
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,000
that paints
the full picture, right?

1268
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:08,793
The six of us have been
sitting there

1269
00:50:08,896 --> 00:50:10,517
for a couple hours
at this point, thinking,

1270
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,172
"What can we do
to save our tushies?"

1271
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:15,793
Katurah, where's
your empathy for the six

1272
00:50:15,896 --> 00:50:18,931
who are desperate to join you
in the next phase of the game?

1273
00:50:19,034 --> 00:50:21,275
I mean, it's inevitable

1274
00:50:21,379 --> 00:50:22,931
that all of our names
will be written down,

1275
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:25,103
and I cannot think
about that moment

1276
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:27,068
without my heart dropping.

1277
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:28,896
Even the concept
of someone saying,

1278
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,517
"Let me write
Katurah's name down."

1279
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,517
The other day, Sifu asked me
how to spell my name,

1280
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,000
and I was like, "Wh-Wh-Wh-Why?

1281
00:50:34,103 --> 00:50:35,827
You don't need to know
about how to spell my name."

1282
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:37,931
You know what I mean?
He was joking.

1283
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,379
But, like, that's where we are.

1284
00:50:40,482 --> 00:50:42,103
And I got lucky today.

1285
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,931
-Yes.
-It very well could be me
sitting right over there,

1286
00:50:45,034 --> 00:50:47,206
and I will not act like
that's not a possibility.

1287
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:51,275
PROBST:
So, Kaleb,
let's get down to it now.

1288
00:50:51,379 --> 00:50:53,965
There are only
six possibilities tonight.

1289
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:57,275
What was your thought process
of how you want to approach it?

1290
00:50:57,379 --> 00:50:59,103
I'm an optimist,

1291
00:50:59,206 --> 00:51:00,896
so I do want
to work with people.

1292
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,931
However, when your name
gets thrown out enough times,

1293
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:06,586
then you start to think,
"How can I just be safe?

1294
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,034
"Like, who do I need
to talk to be able

1295
00:51:08,137 --> 00:51:10,551
"to make clear that I might be
a big threat here,

1296
00:51:10,655 --> 00:51:11,896
but I'm not the biggest
strategic threat here,"

1297
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,862
and I think
that's the big difference.

1298
00:51:13,965 --> 00:51:15,275
So you heard your name today?

1299
00:51:15,379 --> 00:51:16,827
It's like,
wouldn't be Tribal Council

1300
00:51:16,931 --> 00:51:18,896
if I didn't hear my name
at this point.

1301
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,068
-Oh.
-I get it every single time.
I don't know what to do.

1302
00:51:21,172 --> 00:51:22,931
It's, like,
when you reach that kind

1303
00:51:23,034 --> 00:51:25,068
of low,
you just get this happiness

1304
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:27,000
for every day that you do get,
every person

1305
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,862
that you do get to connect with,
right? And so,

1306
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:32,310
this Lulu curse has not lifted
off of Emily and I,

1307
00:51:32,413 --> 00:51:33,655
but knowing
that we gave our best effort--

1308
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,379
that's where
you can be at peace.

1309
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:38,344
PROBST:
Emily, is it really
a Lulu curse, or is it just

1310
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:40,586
the way it went, or am I wrong,
and you feel like...

1311
00:51:40,689 --> 00:51:42,413
Are you sure about that?
Because I think the numbers

1312
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,137
are saying something else, Jeff.

1313
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:45,896
-No, really, I mean...
-Let's go with that
for a minute.

1314
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,448
EMILY:
Yeah. You know, whether or not

1315
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:50,620
it's a curse, I don't know.
But now, on the flip side, look,

1316
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:52,931
seven of us are wearing
orange Buffs right now.

1317
00:51:53,034 --> 00:51:55,931
The tribe dynamics are no longer
relevant in this scenario.

1318
00:51:56,034 --> 00:51:57,689
It's becoming
an individual game.

1319
00:51:57,793 --> 00:52:00,862
And, um, if there's a Lulu
curse, it ends tonight.

1320
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:02,551
PROBST:
J., was there a point today

1321
00:52:02,655 --> 00:52:07,034
where you shifted from, "Hey,
what are we trying to do?" to

1322
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:09,068
"I just got to make sure
it is not J.

1323
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:10,689
that gets written down tonight"?

1324
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:12,689
J. MAYA:
I think you have
to kind of go with the people

1325
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:14,689
that you know
you've built connections with,

1326
00:52:14,793 --> 00:52:17,310
because, you know, tomorrow,
you might still be here,

1327
00:52:17,413 --> 00:52:19,034
but you've burned those bridges
in the process

1328
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,310
of trying to get
to the next day.

1329
00:52:21,413 --> 00:52:24,310
And then, you know,
where are you left?

Kaleb?

1331
00:52:25,862 --> 00:52:27,793
KALEB:
As one final thing I'll say,

1332
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:30,000
you know, 'cause it might
come down to just a few votes.

1333
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:32,448
Like, I might be
the biggest threat here,

1334
00:52:32,551 --> 00:52:33,793
but I still don't think
I'm the biggest strategic threat

1335
00:52:33,896 --> 00:52:35,137
to everybody here.

1336
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:38,586
-Who comes to mind?
-Yeah.

1337
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,517
I think it makes sense for
everybody here to write down J.

1338
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,793
That's very interesting, Kaleb.

1339
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:45,758
Um, well,
I'm curious what you mean

1340
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,206
-by, you're the biggest threat.
-Ooh.

1341
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,655
KALEB:
I think that

1342
00:52:49,758 --> 00:52:51,137
a lot of people
have talked about me

1343
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:53,137
as a physical threat
and a social threat,

1344
00:52:53,241 --> 00:52:56,206
but I think that
the most dangerous thing is

1345
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,827
the fact that there's a block
of three Reba women

1346
00:52:58,931 --> 00:53:00,551
who've been together
for 13 days.

1347
00:53:00,655 --> 00:53:04,551
And I think
for Dee and for Julie,

1348
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:07,103
there's an opportunity,
if you guys let go of J.,

1349
00:53:07,206 --> 00:53:09,206
that it lowers
your guys' threat level a lot.

1350
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,275
J. MAYA:
Lowers the women of Reba--

1351
00:53:11,379 --> 00:53:12,793
their threat level?

1352
00:53:12,896 --> 00:53:14,379
-Yes.
-Okay.

1353
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,241
-That's interesting.
-And then, in addition

1354
00:53:16,344 --> 00:53:19,000
to everybody else, if
we're moving into a tribe of 12,

1355
00:53:19,103 --> 00:53:20,620
that's three votes
that they would already have,

1356
00:53:20,724 --> 00:53:22,758
and anybody can go home,
and then,

1357
00:53:22,862 --> 00:53:25,172
you really lost a lot of power
in the game, right?

1358
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:27,241
You want to mention some other
threats while you're at it?

1359
00:53:27,344 --> 00:53:29,724
I'm comfortable
with what I said.

1360
00:53:29,827 --> 00:53:31,724
I mean, do you guys see
what he's doing right now

1361
00:53:31,827 --> 00:53:33,344
before we're about
to cast votes?

1362
00:53:33,448 --> 00:53:35,586
I mean, he's a self-admitted
biggest threat in this game.

1363
00:53:35,689 --> 00:53:37,586
Like, no one else said that.
He said that right now.

1364
00:53:37,689 --> 00:53:39,862
Not strategically.
I'm by myself.

1365
00:53:39,965 --> 00:53:41,206
If I go into the next round,

1366
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,448
literally,
who... what do I have?

1367
00:53:42,551 --> 00:53:43,827
I can't do anything

1368
00:53:43,931 --> 00:53:45,827
to change the course
of this game right now.

1370

you're by yourself,

to find a home? Who's the home?

-DEE: Nobody knows.
And of course,

1373
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,206
I feel strongly about it
because I heard my name,

1374
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:55,965

so I got to push and fight.

1375

now that you threw my name out

be a threat to your game,

1506
01:02:27,275 --> 01:02:30,206
[sighs] I'm grateful
I got to play, Jeff.

1507
01:02:33,413 --> 01:02:36,137
Glad you were here.
J., the tribe has spoken.

1508
01:02:38,241 --> 01:02:39,241

I forgot what clean smells like.

KENDRA:
Survivor45, baby.

1515
01:03:11,137 --> 01:03:14,448
-No way.
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

1516
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:16,000
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

1517

JAKE:
I see the Reba-Belo war coming.

1523
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,620
I need to take control
of the game.

Next time onSurvivor...

1525
01:03:42,827 --> 01:03:44,724
Two people will be going home.

1526
01:03:44,827 --> 01:03:46,689
Oh. What?

1527
01:03:46,793 --> 01:03:48,448
This is a do-or-die moment.

1528
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:49,793
That is it.

1529

All your cards on the table.

All the marbles are in.

1531
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,000
Boy, bye. [laughs]

1532
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:01,000
It was a unanimous vote
for Kaleb.

1533
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,655
He got saved
through a Shot in the Dark.

1534
01:04:02,758 --> 01:04:05,206
I guess I was the collateral
damage on the revote.

1535
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:08,862
However upsetting it is,
it is pretty freaking wild.

1536
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:11,655
This was the greatest
adventure of my entire life.

1537
01:04:11,758 --> 01:04:13,620
There are no regrets here,
and now it's just smiles.

1538
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,448
So I'm just happy that I got

1539
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:18,000
to come out here
and play a great friggin' game.
