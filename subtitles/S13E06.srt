1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,294
>> JEFF PROBST: previously on

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,630
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,256
Knowing they were outnumbered,

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,467
the men of Raro got to work.

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,635
>> I think they're definitely

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,970
trying to prove themselves to

7
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:12,554
the women so that the women

8
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:13,221
don't try to overthrow all of

9
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,306
the guys.

10
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,141
I love it.

11
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,476
>> PROBST: At the reward

12
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,519
challenge...

13
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,228
>> Pull it in.

14
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,062
Pull it in.

15
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,230
>> PROBST: ...together, Nate and

16
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,982
Adam were unstoppable.

17
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,151
>> Raro wins reward.

18
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,318
>> PROBST: And Jonathan was sent

19
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,654
to Exile Island, where he came

20
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,698
to a realization.

21
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,116
>> I dug for hours and there was

22
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,451
no idol there.

23
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,785
At this point I have to assume

24
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,662
the idol has been found.

25
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,205
>> PROBST: Back at Raro...

26
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,248
>> We've got to get that pot.

27
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,249
>> Oh, you know what?

28
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,208
We need some more salt water.

29
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:42,792
>> PROBST: ...Christina was

30
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,377
testing her tribe's patience.

31
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,211
>> We're all annoyed by

32
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,379
Christina.

33
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,922
She tells people, "Can you do

34
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,090
this, can you do that?"

35
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,134
>> Somebody help.

36
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,218
>> She'd better watch herself.

37
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,386
>> PROBST: At the immunity

38
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,596
challenge...

39
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,014
>> Rebecca's not up.

40
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,015
>> PROBST: ...Raro fell short.

41
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:01,770
>> Aitu wins immunity!

42
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,313
>> PROBST: After the challenge,

43
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,439
the tribe was united on who was

44
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:08,026
next to go.

45
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,735
>> Okay.

46
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:09,527
>> Yeah.

47
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,570
>> Yeah.

48
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,613
>> PROBST: but Stephannie's talk

49
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,822
of home...

50
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,823
>> I can see myself going home

51
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,866
and getting some mashed potatoes

52
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,158
and gravy.

53
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,827
>> PROBST: ...made the tribe

54
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,495
wonder if her head was in the

55
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,329
game.

56
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,246
>> She's already mentally

57
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,289
checked out.

58
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,290
>> PROBST: At tribal council...

59
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,249
>> You know, I thought Christina

60
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,167
knew she was kind of, like, that

61
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:24,334
way.

62
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,210
>> PROBST: ...Christina learned

63
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,170
she was on shaky ground.

64
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,213
>> It's just her personality.

65
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,297
You know, it can be a little

66
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,049
nerve-wracking sometimes.

67
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,091
>> PROBST: But in the end...

68
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,009
The fifth person voted out of

69
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,052
Cook Islands...

70
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,011
It was Stephannie who was sent

71
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:35,887
home.

72
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,431
Stephanie, the tribe has spoken.

73
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,891
14 are left.

74
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,560
Who will be voted out tonight?

75
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,439
Captioning sponsored by

76
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,357
CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK

77
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,779
TELEVISION

78
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,209
>> When we came back from

79
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,293
tribal, there was a lot of

80
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,169
tension, like I knew there would

81
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,212
be.

82
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,296
And I knew that Christina was

83
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,256
offended by what had happened

84
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,133
during tribal council.

85
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,218
It wasn't intended.

86
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,554
It didn't mean to come out.

87
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,847
But Adam responded.

88
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,931
And unfortunately she got her

89
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,057
feelings hurt.

90
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,016
>> You know what's funny, is for

91
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,642
the past few days you guys have

92
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,143
been kind of rude.

93
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,144
And I've noticed it.

94
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:25,728
Like, when it comes to passing

95
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,396
things, you snapped at me twice.

96
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,147
>> I said you were annoying

97
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:28,398
tonight.

98
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,357
>> No, you didn't say that.

99
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,233
>> And then I left it alone.

100
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,068
>> You never said that.

101
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:32,944
When did you say that?

102
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:33,862
>> Talking about passing things,

103
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,612
you're like, "Give me that, give

104
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,363
me that."

105
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:35,864
I mean, it just gets...

106
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,115
>> I always say please.

107
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:37,907
I always say please.

108
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,783
>> No, you don't.

109
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,119
No, you don't.

110
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,161
>> I have heard Adam snap at

111
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,162
Christina and calling her

112
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,122
annoying and I thought that was

113
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:44,747
kind of a little bit of a low

114
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,250
blow.

115
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,043
She's used to being in control.

116
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:49,919
She's not used to people telling

117
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,753
her what to do.

118
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,629
And it's really showing.

119
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,338
>> It's your personality.

120
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:52,922
>> Well, you could have said

121
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,132
something to me.

122
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:54,924
>> Your personality is...

123
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,675
>> We have to accept you the way

124
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,384
you are.

125
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:56,634
That's it.

126
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,094
>> No, but you could have said

127
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:58,845
something if it was bothering

128
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,554
you.

129
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,305
>> We can't change you,

130
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:00,597
Christina.

131
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,056
>> It's not like you're sitting

132
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,849
around not doing anything and we

133
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,808
want you to change that.

134
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,684
>> You said I annoyed you.

135
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,560
>> I mean, it's just the way it

136
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:10,273
is.

137
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,942
>> I just don't understand.

138
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,943
I never thought that's what they

139
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,444
thought of me.

140
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,071
But I'm going to stick my head

141
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,282
up high still.

142
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,533
And I have gone through a lot of

143
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,451
stuff.

144
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,327
I have been shot and all of that

145
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,244
stuff.

146
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:23,745
I mean, yeah, those are

147
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,287
tragedies in my life.

148
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,164
I know survived a lot of other

149
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:26,998
things in my life.

150
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,125
I'm going to survive this.

151
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,807
>> Nice.

152
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,184
Look at that.

153
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,686
One, two, three, four, five more

154
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,353
of them.

155
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,354
Jonathan and I went fishing this

156
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,481
morning.

157
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,358
We went out to my same little

158
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,401
spot that I like.

159
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,360
I'm getting to know that area

160
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,404
very well.

161
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,405
And I have a few special holes

162
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,448
in the coral that I like to

163
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,365
visit.

164
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,077
So I can catch ten fish easily

165
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,246
within an hour or so.

166
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,539
>> Oh, baby!

167
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,582
You got him!

168
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,584
Yeah.

169
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,086
Look at the size of that.

170
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,463
>> Ozzy can hold his breath for

171
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,422
two and a half minutes or

172
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,799
something crazy like that.

173
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,884
The kid's like an otter or

174
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,843
something.

175
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:44,802
I mean, he's a great fisherman.

176
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,138
He's proven that time and again.

177
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:47,722
We need his strength for the

178
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,224
group to move forward.

179
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:50,850
But as an individual threat, he

180
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,479
is the biggest threat.

181
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,646
Certainly if the merge were to

182
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,856
happen today, I wouldn't want

183
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,150
him around, because Ozzy as an

184
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,526
individual is a very, very

185
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,695
strong player.

186
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,993
>> Oh, please be good to us,

187
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:09,869
tree mail.

188
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,120
Ahh!

189
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,705
Ah.

190
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,040
It's a mast.

191
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,500
It's a sail.

192
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,793
>> Tree mail.

193
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,960
>> All right, guys, gather

194
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:18,503
round.

195
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,880
"This head-to-head match needs a

196
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,174
well-balanced team.

197
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,425
To win your first feast, you

198
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,677
will kick and you will

199
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,305
scream.

200
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,057
To win your first feast you will

201
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,475
kick and you will scream."

202
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,059
It doesn't say anything about

203
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,310
immunity.

204
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,646
I wonder...

205
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,480
>> I believe we should bring

206
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,606
him.

207
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,690
I'm the priest.

208
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,525
I like to carry him.

209
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:40,983
I feel like I'm holy.

210
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,318
I should bring it.

211
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,069
>> I would prefer not to have

212
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,570
it.

213
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,655
>> I would bring the immunity

214
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,573
idol with us at all time, every

215
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,658
challenge.

216
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,617
We should bring him.

217
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,993
I believe Atangaroa is the ocean

218
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:51,994
god of fertility, and he came to

219
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,663
us an immunity idol.

220
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,958
He's our extra member.

221
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,126
>> You're saying, like, that's

222
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,210
your spirituality.

223
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,128
>> It means something to me.

224
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,712
It would mean nothing to you, I

225
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,423
would carry it.

226
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,383
>> Yeah, but it means something

227
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:05,675
else to me.

228
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,467
It means that when we bring the

229
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,427
immunity idol to a reward

230
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,053
challenge that we're sticking it

231
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:13,891
in their face.

232
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,725
>> I know that you don't, so I

233
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,935
respect that.

234
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,311
But since we're a team, let's at

235
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:17,895
least get everybody's opinion.

236
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,563
>> Have it your way.

237
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,439
It's less of a burden for me to

238
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,315
carry.

239
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,316
I don't need to argue.

240
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,609
Hell with it.

241
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,486
>> Cao Boi, you know, he is

242
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,529
rubbing some people the wrong

243
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,488
way.

244
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,072
He does have to get talked out

245
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,490
of a tree once in a while.

246
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,032
You know, and nobody really

247
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,534
spoke up except me.

248
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,535
Do you understand where I'm

249
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,578
coming from, Cao Boi, or where I

250
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,413
think most of us are coming

251
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,164
from?

252
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:36,914
>> That's fine.

253
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,623
We're good sportsmen, and we

254
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,082
play, and that's fair.

255
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,458
You know, that's the American

256
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,377
way.

257
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,211
>> Cao Boi, he's gone through a

258
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,172
lot of things in life.

259
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,257
He knows a lot.

260
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,091
At the same time he is very

261
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:47,884
hardheaded.

262
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,634
I mean, he's just an

263
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,720
unpredictable guy.

264
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,978
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

265
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,941
Aitu getting your

266
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,859
first look at the new Raro

267
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,110
tribe.

268
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,195
Stephannie voted out at the last

269
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:11,490
tribal council.

270
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,700
All right, are you ready to get

271
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,826
to today's challenge?

272
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,702
>> Yes.

273
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,745
>> Yeah.

274
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,829
>> PROBST: Today's challenge is

275
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,164
physical.

276
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,248
Here's how it works.

277
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,042
Each tribe will select three

278
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,335
people.

279
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,711
Each of those three will be

280
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,005
stationed at their own post.

281
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,340
On my go, two members of the

282
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,758
other tribe will race out and

283
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,345
attempt to physically remove you

284
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,514
from your post and drag you

285
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,515
through the sand to their finish

286
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,850
line.

287
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,185
Once they have accomplished

288
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,478
that, two other tribe members

289
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,562
will race out and attempt to do

290
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,397
it with the second person.

291
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,107
First tribe to get all three of

292
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,484
the opposing tribe members

293
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,361
across their finish line wins

294
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:48,694
the challenge.

295
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,738
Make sense?

296
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,697
>> Mm-hmm.

297
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:51,948
>> Yeah.

298
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,533
>> PROBST: Want to know what

299
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,283
you're playing for?

300
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:54,951
>> Yeah.

301
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,868
>> PROBST: It's good news-bad

302
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,827
news.

303
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,828
Good news is the winners will

304
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,830
feast on thick lamb shanks,

305
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:04,502
bread, apple cider.

306
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,379
Bad news is you will be feasting

307
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:10,383
at tribal council, because, win

308
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,802
or lose, both tribes are going

309
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,387
to tribal council tonight.

310
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,722
Both tribes will vote somebody

311
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,308
out.

312
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,685
Here is how it will work.

313
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,978
The winning tribe will go to

314
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,229
tribal council first.

315
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,480
You will have your tribal

316
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:25,064
council and vote somebody out.

317
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,191
You will then move to the jury

318
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,526
section, and you will feast

319
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,319
while listening in on the losing

320
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,405
tribe's tribal council.

321
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,115
>> Oh, my goodness.

322
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,533
>> PROBST: So not only do you

323
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,158
get food, you get knowledge of

324
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:36,742
what is going on in the other

325
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,619
tribe.

326
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,787
Because today's challenge

327
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,539
requires equal numbers of men

328
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,040
and women, Aitu, you have one

329
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,293
extra member, you must sit out a

330
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,253
man.

331
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:47,753
>> It's purely physical.

332
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,672
Do you want to sit out?

333
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,049
>> You want to sit me out?

334
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,092
>> PROBST: Who's it going to be?

335
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:53,926
Who's sitting out?

336
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,677
>> Cao Boi.

337
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,678
>> Cao Boi.

338
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,262
>> PROBST: All right, Cao Boi,

339
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,596
take a seat.

340
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,431
I will give you guys a minute to

341
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,181
figure out who is going to be on

342
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,684
the post, we'll get started.

343
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,187
Here we go.

344
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,814
On the post for Aitu, Candice,

345
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,401
Ozzy and Sundra.

346
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,902
On the post for Raro, Chris

347
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,821
Christina, Nate, and Jenny.

348
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,781
Starting with the women.

349
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,907
Survivors ready.

350
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,201
Go.

351
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:19,827
You've got to pull them off of

352
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,121
their post and drag them across

353
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,875
your finish line.

354
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,376
>> Get her leg.

355
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,170
Get her leg.

356
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:29,795
Get her leg.

357
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,964
>> PROBST: Becky and Jessica

358
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,466
double-teaming on Jenny, trying

359
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,259
to separate her legs, get her

360
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,510
off that post.

361
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,095
Candice is not budging for Aitu.

362
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,307
>> Damn, lady, let go.

363
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:41,891
>> PROBST: Jessica and Becky

364
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:46,187
have Jenny face down now.

365
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,980
Candice finally off the post.

366
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,232
Candice getting back on the post

367
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,693
again!

368
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,986
>> Becky, grab the other leg and

369
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,488
drag her.

370
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,697
>> Drag her!

371
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,907
Just drag her!

372
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,784
>> Drag her!

373
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,076
That's it.

374
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,619
>> PROBST: Rebecca yanking on

375
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,536
Candice.

376
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,537
>> Yeah!

377
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,163
>> PROBST: Getting very physical

378
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,208
between Candice and Rebecca.

379
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,751
Becky and Jessica making up some

380
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,043
ground now.

381
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:09,794
They've got Jenny.

382
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,629
They're dragging her.

383
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,254
You've got to get a part of her

384
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,590
body to touch this line.

385
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,049
>> Come on, Jessica!

386
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,843
>> PROBST: Go!

387
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,472
Jonathan and Yul taking on Nate.

388
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,723
Raro still working on their

389
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,975
first person.

390
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,310
They've got to get Candice

391
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,937
across that line.

392
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,148
Jonathan and Yul trying to get

393
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,192
Nate off that post, but he is

394
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,153
not making it easy.

395
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,698
Candice now on top of Rebecca.

396
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:46,831
Parvati can't pull them both.

397
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,582
Nate doing a great job fighting

398
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,584
off two guys!

399
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,752
>> There you go, there you go.

400
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,837
>> PROBST: Nate making Jonathan

401
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,966
and Yul really work.

402
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,801
They're getting closer with

403
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,594
Candice.

404
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,013
Candice takes Parvati down!

405
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,434
>> Come on, guys.

406
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,059
>> PROBST: Nate's over the line.

407
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,978
Go, go!

408
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,689
Aitu heading out to for their

409
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,691
last opponent, Christina.

410
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,067
Parvati very close with Candice.

411
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,402
Got to get her to touch.

412
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,028
Go!

413
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,947
Candice is across, finally.

414
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,949
Aitu with the lead.

415
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,202
Raro's got to make up ground.

416
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,872
Adam and Brad going aggressive

417
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,415
after Ozzy.

418
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,750
They've got to get Ozzy across

419
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,587
that line and work on Sundra.

420
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,547
>> You're choking!

421
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:36,922
Get off my neck!

422
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,968
>> PROBST: No choking!

423
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,596
>> Stay away from my neck.

424
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,763
>> PROBST: Watch it, Christina.

425
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,432
Be easy.

426
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,016
Ozzy fighting them off as hard

427
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,643
as he can.

428
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,813
He's outweighed by a lot.

429
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,774
Christina trying to pull

430
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,693
Jessica's pants off.

431
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,528
>> Girls, pick her up.

432
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,363
Move her forward.

433
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,656
>> PROBST: Christina making it

434
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,074
very tough on Jessica and Becky,

435
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,077
giving Raro a chance.

436
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,662
Adam and Brad working Ozzy,

437
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,372
getting closer.

438
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,790
Raro getting back in this

439
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,083
challenge.

440
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,418
Got to get that foot to

441
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,253
touch the line.

442
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,297
Go, go!

443
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,798
Adam, Ozzy, and Brad, worn out.

444
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,885
It comes down to this.

445
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,887
Becky and Jessica trying to get

446
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,974
Christina across their line.

447
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,227
Parvati and Rebecca trying to

448
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,019
get Sundra off the post.

449
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,730
>> Don't look at them!

450
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,106
Come on!

451
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,066
>> Roll, roll, roll, roll!

452
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,360
>> PROBST: Christina, watch the

453
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,071
hair.

454
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,614
Sundra not budging off that

455
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,241
post.

456
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,659
>> Grab her legs, Becky!

457
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,661
Grab her legs.

458
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,703
>> PROBST: Becky pulling at her

459
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,788
shoes now, trying to get hold of

460
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,997
something.

461
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,749
Becky showing some life.

462
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,918
Parvati and Rebecca still

463
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,670
working on Sundra.

464
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,463
They've got her arms free but

465
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,548
not her legs.

466
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,093
Becky and Jessica very close.

467
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,845
Christina not giving up.

468
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:12,184
>> Jessica, push her, push her.

469
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,227
>> PROBST: Got to get that foot

470
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,144
on there.

471
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,104
Yes!

472
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:15,896
Aitu wins the challenge.

473
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,149
It's over!

474
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,199
Well, I said it was going to be

475
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,325
a physical challenge, and it

476
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:28,951
certainly was.

477
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,203
Good effort, I thought, by both

478
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,746
tribes.

479
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,789
Here's now it is going to work

480
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:34,748
tonight.

481
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,666
Aitu will go to tribal council

482
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,750
first.

483
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,293
You will vote somebody out.

484
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,295
You will then enjoy your feast

485
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,004
while listening in on Raro's

486
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,756
tribal council, where Raro will

487
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,383
vote somebody out.

488
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,759
In addition, there will be one

489
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,553
more surprise revealed tonight.

490
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,178
See you both at tribal council.

491
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,974
Get your stuff, head on out.

492
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,039
>> It was fun but it was crazy.

493
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,961
>> I was so proud of the tribe

494
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,588
today in challenge.

495
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,131
Oh, my god.

496
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,299
We just worked together so

497
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,550
beautifully, because it was a

498
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,176
physical challenge, and we came

499
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,055
together and we did it.

500
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,514
>> It came down to the girls.

501
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,891
You guys were way more physical

502
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,392
than them.

503
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,899
>> Yeah.

504
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:42,900
>> Christina, when she is

505
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:43,817
realized she was going to have

506
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,860
to budge and I was going to make

507
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:45,444
her, he is started pulling my

508
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,154
hair and, you know, ripping my

509
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,573
clothes off, you know, so I

510
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,949
thought that was a little

511
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,451
uncalled for.

512
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,535
>> A cop ain't used to getting

513
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,913
her ass kicked, you know.

514
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,210
>> We did it.

515
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,294
>> We won ourselves our big

516
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,170
feast.

517
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,254
It was a great day.

518
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,422
But it was very hard to come

519
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,507
back and know that somebody is

520
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:29,863
going to be going home, though.

521
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,989
>> I had this dream, I was

522
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:31,990
dealing with all of these

523
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,908
supernatural people with

524
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,034
supernatural power.

525
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,035
And there was a shaman lady,

526
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,078
like this old lady.

527
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,121
And she had all kinds of credit

528
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,081
card applications.

529
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,416
And she asked me if I have an

530
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,085
American Express or Visa, all of

531
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,086
this stuff.

532
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,129
I'm looking at it, and I said

533
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,296
"What do I need it for?"

534
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,048
She said, "Well, you need three

535
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,509
of that and three of that."

536
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,094
And I thought three and three--

537
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,220
that's how you can defeat the

538
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,181
immunity idol.

539
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,434
You can flush it out.

540
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,393
And I woke up and I go, whoa,

541
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:07,901
"Plan Voodoo."

542
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,527
>> Cao Boi believes John has the

543
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,154
hidden immunity idol.

544
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,740
So Plan Voodoo would split our

545
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,158
votes between Jonathan and

546
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,201
Candice, forcing a three-three

547
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,494
tie.

548
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,579
And if Jonathan has the hidden

549
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,246
immunity idol, it would force it

550
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,206
to be played.

551
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,708
And so that way you accomplish

552
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,751
two goals.

553
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,752
One, you get the hidden immunity

554
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,794
idol out of Jonathan's hands

555
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,837
and, two, you get one of those

556
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,921
two people to go home.

557
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,256
That's very interesting.

558
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,762
>> Think about it.

559
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,512
That's the only strategy I could

560
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,305
think of that works.

561
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,097
>> That's a very interesting

562
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,266
idea.

563
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,100
>> I think the plan is

564
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:40,350
ingenious.

565
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,935
I know that neither John nor

566
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:42,895
Candice have the hidden immunity

567
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:43,896
idol, because I have it.

568
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:44,813
But it's a great plan to break

569
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,939
down Jonathan's alliance with

570
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:46,940
the members of their original

571
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,195
white tribe.

572
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:51,737
>> John has been to Exile

573
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,280
Island.

574
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,364
Yul and Candice have been to

575
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,324
Exile Island.

576
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,200
But Jonathan has been there

577
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,117
twice.

578
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:57,701
He actually had five days and

579
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,202
four nights.

580
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,204
So he has the most time.

581
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,664
And if we merge, the Caucasians,

582
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,625
they become real strong.

583
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,085
If they have five members

584
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:06,668
intact, they can knock us all

585
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,837
out.

586
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,727
>> We lost the challenge today,

587
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,395
and that gets a double whack--

588
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,356
not only back to back, but

589
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,483
losing the feast.

590
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,484
It hurts.

591
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,610
I don't want to talk to anyone.

592
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,820
But I can't have that attitude.

593
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,987
And I said, "Okay, I'm going to

594
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:34,988
get us food.

595
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,948
We're going to eat good tonight

596
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,199
regardless."

597
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,159
Adam I got another one!

598
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,454
I'll pull its fat ass out.

599
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,957
He's a big boy.

600
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:58,178
Whoa!

601
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:58,720
>> We have to go to tribal

602
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,346
council tonight.

603
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,306
And I'm bummed because I could

604
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,683
be the next one out of my tribe,

605
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,684
especially after last night's

606
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,978
tribal council.

607
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:06,603
Basically they were saying that

608
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,312
I'm trying to take control of

609
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,189
situations, I'm overbearing.

610
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:16,321
But I will see what I can do.

611
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,197
>> I would definitely give you a

612
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:17,406
chance.

613
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,032
I'm up for giving anyone a

614
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:19,825
chance.

615
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,495
>> Okay.

616
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,288
Would you give me a chance

617
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:24,538
tonight?

618
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,330
>> I don't know who I'm

619
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,165
voting... I really haven't even

620
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,418
thought about it.

621
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,711
>> I will definitely keep

622
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,587
fighting and keep working hard.

623
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,130
And if you guys give me a chance

624
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,464
I promise I will not fail you

625
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,425
guys.

626
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,260
>> I think my effort in the

627
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,219
challenge today helped me out,

628
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,430
but I'm bummed because I can be

629
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,557
the next one out of my tribe.

630
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,558
I don't know.

631
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,601
We'll see what happens.

632
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,560
I will try to talk to some

633
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,436
people, and hopefully it will

634
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,395
change some things and hopefully

635
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:54,443
I won't get booted out tonight.

636
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,402
And I'm sorry that we just

637
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,403
butted heads.

638
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,405
And I know that... you know, if

639
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:06,204
I annoyed you I'm very sorry.

640
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,205
But I'm just asking if you just

641
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,206
give me one more chance...

642
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,249
>> That's fine with me.

643
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,084
I will talk to the guys.

644
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:11,460
>> Okay, thanks.

645
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,754
>> Christina is obviously the

646
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,339
outsider of the tribe right now.

647
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,590
She's kind of tried to get us to

648
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,758
go against each other, because

649
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm sure she's going to feel

650
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,718
like she needs to scramble at

651
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,012
this point.

652
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,725
>> I was just like, "Okay," but

653
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,561
obviously...

654
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,980
>> No, don't worry about it.

655
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,981
I think we've got a game plan

656
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:33,857
and I think we're going to stick

657
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,733
to it.

658
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,692
>> Christina's the one that's

659
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,735
going to be voted off.

660
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,986
And I don't think that's

661
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,988
changed.

662
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,365
>> Oh, my god, you're amazing.

663
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,369
Oh, my god.

664
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,495
>> Will you?

665
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,329
>> Yeah.

666
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,206
>> And I promise I won't let you

667
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:49,957
down.

668
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,666
>> I got you.

669
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,583
>> Okay, thanks.

670
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,794
>> Of course.

671
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,045
>> Christina is close with me.

672
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,254
A lot of good characteristics

673
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:56,505
about her.

674
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,256
She is gave it her all today,

675
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,590
which is good.

676
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,384
And that was enough for me to

677
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,510
say, "Maybe, you know, you could

678
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:10,686
be valuable."

679
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,895
>> Adam snaps at her so bad, I

680
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,938
think she feels like...

681
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,189
>> He needs to get some class.

682
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:14,856
You do not talk to a woman like

683
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,483
that in disrespect.

684
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,068
I'm scared that Jenny may be

685
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,528
tight with them other Asians on

686
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,696
the other team.

687
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,822
If they merge, and there's three

688
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,240
of them, she could cut us up.

689
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,200
>> Want me to cut while you

690
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:25,367
pull?

691
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,368
>> Whatever, yeah.

692
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,369
You can cut while I pull.

693
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,537
>> Okay.

694
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,456
>> If we were going to keep

695
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,834
Christina, Jenny would have to

696
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,293
go.

697
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:35,836
She's a good tough cookie.

698
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,503
I love her.

699
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,462
So it's a toss-up.

700
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,965
Christina's strong, but her

701
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,425
mouth's strong.

702
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,759
Jenny's sweet, but I don't know

703
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,969
if I can trust her yet.

704
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:44,970
So it would be kind of... you

705
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,430
know?

706
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,201
>> Oh, that feels great.

707
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,412
Thank you.

708
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,007
>> That's my biggest concern.

709
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,300
>> Okay.

710
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:23,925
>> We did not lose the challenge

711
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:24,509
today.

712
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,552
We won.

713
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,595
It was just a twist of the game

714
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,388
that said we had to vote

715
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,807
somebody off.

716
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,850
And the consensus is that Cao

717
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,268
Boi should go because he is

718
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:39,608
pissing people off.

719
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,734
Something as simple as, "I want

720
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,735
to take the immunity idol.

721
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,819
Well, that's what I believe in."

722
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,987
You know, so he is a bit of a

723
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,197
wild card, and it's time to vote

724
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:56,625
him off.

725
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,587
>> You're a J.

726
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,422
>> Cao Boi has this theory that

727
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,549
the white alliance is going to

728
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,634
take over the game so we need to

729
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,595
get them out.

730
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,305
And maybe it's a good idea,

731
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:10,847
because I'm suspicious of

732
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,640
Jonathan.

733
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,725
Maybe it's the way he will say

734
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,810
something, maybe the way he will

735
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,353
look at somebody.

736
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,479
And when it smells a little

737
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,688
fishy, then you're like, "Okay,

738
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:37,290
I don't know."

739
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:37,916
>> I'm in a tight alliance with

740
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,459
Becky, Jonathan, Candice, and

741
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,420
Sundra.

742
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,380
Although now I'm not sure.

743
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,339
The girls, it's possible they

744
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,550
might want to vote off Jonathan.

745
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,801
For whatever reason he seems to

746
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,678
inspire some level of mistrust

747
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,929
among everyone.

748
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:51,513
They think he is playing the

749
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,515
game very, very hard.

750
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,808
And their suspicion of Jonathan

751
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,851
has started to rub off on me a

752
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,435
little bit myself.

753
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,396
I mean, you know, if everyone

754
00:23:59,479 --> 00:23:59,938
kind of universally holds

755
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:00,564
Jonathan in some degree of

756
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,606
suspicion, then it kind of makes

757
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,442
me wonder-- maybe I should, too.

758
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,160
>> We're brothers.

759
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,287
We've got to remember that.

760
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,583
>> Yeah.

761
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,168
>> Ozzy, have you got it?

762
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,252
>> It's hard to say if Plan

763
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,920
Voodoo is a good idea or not.

764
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,422
There is a lot of chaos in camp,

765
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,299
and people don't know who

766
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,800
they're going to vote for for

767
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,136
sure.

768
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:31,720
So I'm just trying to play it

769
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,680
all by ear as far, you know, my

770
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:46,359
gut instincts are concerned.

771
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,485
>> I do feel bad that people

772
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,486
have to go.

773
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,112
I'd like to try to play the game

774
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:49,654
with as much integrity and

775
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,697
honesty as I can.

776
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,740
I'm finding it to be very, very

777
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,159
complicated, because I feel like

778
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:54,659
people do trust me.

779
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,870
But as a result of that, they

780
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,330
think I'm in separate alliances

781
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:58,955
with them, and obviously I can't

782
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,041
be in alliance with everyone.

783
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,375
So for me it's a question of how

784
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:02,959
far can you get in this game,

785
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,669
and who do I trust?

786
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,725
>> Relax, we'll be okay.

787
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,810
We have plan voodoo in effect.

788
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,853
I believe I can trust Becky and

789
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,231
Yul.

790
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,357
That's gut instinct.

791
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,650
They are solid, solid people.

792
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,444
I have the utmost faith in them.

793
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:36,785
>> How's your stomach?

794
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,119
>> You feel totally stressed

795
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,287
out.

796
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,665
Are you stressed out?

797
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,085
>> Tonight, if I get voted off,

798
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:45,669
I will be shocked.

799
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,712
I don't believe that's going to

800
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,838
happen.

801
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:49,881
I've got some pretty tight

802
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:50,924
partners.

803
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,259
If I'm wrong, then I've been

804
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,718
outplayed, and the conspiracy is

805
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,137
much bigger than I can picture.

806
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,409
>> PROBST: First things first.

807
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,743
Obviously, Cao Boi, you've

808
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,287
brought the immunity idol.

809
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:20,704
A first.

810
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,747
What's the reason?

811
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,957
>> We should bring it since we

812
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,959
have no more immunity, do we?

813
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,585
We're about to vote someone out.

814
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,545
>> PROBST: I haven't asked for

815
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:29,379
it back.

816
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,588
What do you want to do with it?

817
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,424
>> He will be another member.

818
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,008
>> PROBST: Ozzy, what is the

819
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,634
deal with the idol?

820
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,802
Because sometimes you bring it

821
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,803
to challenges when you don't

822
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:37,762
need it.

823
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,805
Tonight you bring it to tribal

824
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,181
council when you don't need it.

825
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,766
>> It's one of the things that,

826
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,476
for example, Cao Boi feels

827
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,936
connected to it, and that he

828
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,937
should bring it.

829
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,147
Other people don't care.

830
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,189
And some people feel totally

831
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,149
against it.

832
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,191
So it's just kind of, like,

833
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:50,859
symbolic for other issues within

834
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,736
the tribe.

835
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,987
>> PROBST: Yul, tell me about

836
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,238
Cao Boi.

837
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,240
>> Cao Boi is a mixture of

838
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,326
shaman, cheerleader, I mean,

839
00:26:59,409 --> 00:26:59,868
fire tender.

840
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,245
He is very loyal in his way.

841
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:02,871
I can't say I fully understand

842
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,998
him.

843
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:05,999
You know, he has his own

844
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,459
perspective on things.

845
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,835
>> PROBST: Cao Boi, typically,

846
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,587
care you understood by people or

847
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,589
are you often misunderstood?

848
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,132
>> Typically in life I'm either

849
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,592
hated or I'm loved.

850
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,052
It's one or the other.

851
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:17,886
I am often misunderstood.

852
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,971
But eventually, if I have the

853
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,222
time, a lot of people will come

854
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,807
to understand that I mean well.

855
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,810
>> PROBST: Yul, are there clear-

856
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,771
cut leaders and followers on

857
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,897
this tribe?

858
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,898
>> There aren't any designated

859
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,775
leaders.

860
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,234
I think Jonathan and Cao Boi are

861
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,569
the most vocal in terms of

862
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:35,070
stating their opinions.

863
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,780
I think Jonathan is what I would

864
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,199
call sort of a natural leader.

865
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:39,866
I think he is very good about

866
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,285
articulating his positions and

867
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,037
thinking for the group.

868
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,205
>> PROBST: Jonathan, is that a

869
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,539
fair assessment?

870
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,165
>> I appreciate him saying that.

871
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:47,916
But it's not like what I say

872
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,043
goes.

873
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,669
It's not a role that I assume.

874
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,505
I mean, I certainly don't

875
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,672
patronize these people or talk

876
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,173
down to them in any way.

877
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,841
I don't think I do.

878
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,594
>> PROBST: Ozzy, what do you

879
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,970
base a vote on?

880
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,222
I know you don't want to get rid

881
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,390
of anybody, and the tribe is

882
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,766
jelling.

883
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,184
>> Man, that's something that

884
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:06,810
has been going through my head

885
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,812
all afternoon.

886
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,105
I'm still not quite sure if I've

887
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:10,855
come to a conclusion, and I'm

888
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,191
trying to work it out and search

889
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:13,817
my heart and see what it's going

890
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,985
to tell me so that we can all

891
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,570
continue on.

892
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,947
>> PROBST: Cao Boi, what do you

893
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,864
draw on for your vote?

894
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,908
You assess this tribe, you've

895
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,868
got to get rid of somebody.

896
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,703
>> We're looking down the road

897
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,830
to the big picture to see what's

898
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,956
going on.

899
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,290
It's sort of like a chess game.

900
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:29,958
And so the queen is pretty much

901
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,419
undefeated on the board, but we

902
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,878
want to see if we can expose the

903
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,338
queen, find a weakness in the

904
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:35,964
queen.

905
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,924
>> PROBST: Okay, I'm confused.

906
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,426
What does the queen represent in

907
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,553
this game?

908
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,679
>> The queen represents

909
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,638
immunity.

910
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,722
It represents individual

911
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:44,973
immunity.

912
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,807
>> PROBST: So tonight's vote is

913
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,601
trying to expose the hidden

914
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:48,935
immunity idol?

915
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,062
>> Yes.

916
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,564
Basically this tribe will walk

917
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,691
away and we will see a clearer

918
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,316
picture of what we need to do to

919
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,319
continue playing in this game.

920
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,321
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

921
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,531
vote.

922
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,782
If someone has the hidden

923
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,284
immunity idol and it turns out

924
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,994
you need to play it, you would

925
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:06,911
play it after the vote.

926
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,289
You would then be safe from the

927
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,498
vote, and the person with the

928
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,040
next highest number of votes

929
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,876
would go home.

930
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,252
It is time to vote.

931
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,920
Jonathan, you're up.

932
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,221
>> I think I have to take any

933
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,306
wild card out of the game that I

934
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,640
can.

935
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,017
Good luck to you.

936
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:36,858
>> (<i> whispering</i> ) Sorry, bub.

937
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,985
I lost my trust in you.

938
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,784
>> (<i> whipsering</i> ) I hope we

939
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,827
stick with this Voodoo Plan.

940
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,204
Where is the immunity idol?

941
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,080
Let's hope it comes out.

942
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,517
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

943
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,769
votes.

944
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,820
Once the votes are read, the

945
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:23,780
decision is final.

946
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,781
The person voted out will be

947
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,323
asked to leave the tribal

948
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:25,949
council area immediately.

949
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,202
I'll read the votes.

950
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:33,289
First vote, Cao Boi.

951
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,794
Candice.

952
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,419
One vote Candice, one vote Cao

953
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:43,007
Boi.

954
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,176
Jonathan.

955
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,427
One vote Jonathan, one vote

956
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,181
Candice, one vote Cao Boi.

957
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:50,974
Cao Boi.

958
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,936
Two votes Cao Boi.

959
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,522
Cao Boi.

960
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,147
That's three votes Cao Boi, one

961
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:04,487
vote Candice, one vote Jonathan.

962
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,240
Sixth person voted out

963
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,033
of<i> Survivor: Cook Islands,</i> Cao

964
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,201
<i>Boi.</i>

965
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,119
That's four.

966
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,036
That's enough.

967
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,954
Unless you have the hidden

968
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,580
immunity idol, you need to bring

969
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,249
me your torch.

970
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,091
Cao Boi, the tribe has spoken.

971
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,554
Time for you to go.

972
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,521
>> PROBST: Well, the hard part's

973
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,022
over.

974
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,482
Now for the fun-- some food and

975
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,693
a little eavesdropping.

976
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,944
There's a spot for your torches

977
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,321
just off the path.

978
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,363
You can have a seat over in the

979
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,824
jury section.

980
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,997
>> It was a wonderful

981
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,081
experience.

982
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,124
I had a great time.

983
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,500
I didn't make it as far as I

984
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,752
planned on going, but that's how

985
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,002
it goes.

986
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,881
I did learn I am most vulnerable

987
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,591
among the Asian community--

988
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,800
people who are like me but not

989
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,092
like me.

990
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,094
I was aware of them in the

991
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,220
beginning.

992
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,388
But eventually I learned to

993
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,431
trust them.

994
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,642
I should have known better.

995
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,107
>> PROBST: We will now bring in

996
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,067
the Raro tribe for their tribal

997
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,403
council.

998
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,045
Raro, before we get to your

999
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,129
tribal council, I owe Aitu some

1000
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,840
food.

1001
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,308
Bread, lamb shanks.

1002
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,977
It's heavy and hot.

1003
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,276
Because I want you to have a

1004
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,570
civilized meal, some napkins.

1005
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,519
>> PROBST: Raro, a lot to look

1006
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,603
at over there.

1007
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,605
Cao Boi just voted out, and food

1008
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,399
that I know you would love to

1009
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,609
race over and get a hold of.

1010
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,861
Not really, Adam?

1011
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:50,903
>> I don't really like lamb or

1012
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,195
apple cider.

1013
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,156
I really don't.

1014
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,073
We've got plenty of food at our

1015
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,199
camp, so that doesn't bother me

1016
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,409
at all.

1017
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,202
>> PROBST: Nate, you seem quiet

1018
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,454
tonight.

1019
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,997
>> Snap, that smells good over

1020
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,248
there.

1021
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,458
And I'm not even thinking about

1022
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,876
it, because we had a good

1023
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,043
octopus dinner.

1024
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,170
So, you know, it's all good, but

1025
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,797
yeah, this loss was wack today.

1026
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,090
I tried to give it all I had but

1027
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,258
I guess we didn't have enough as

1028
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,844
a team.

1029
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,387
>> PROBST: Adam, how frustrating

1030
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,806
is it to lose and lose and lose?

1031
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,432
You have lost as a tribe 2/3 of

1032
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,810
the challenges now.

1033
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,770
>> It's extremely frustrating,

1034
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,771
Jeff.

1035
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,980
But today, Candice just set the

1036
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,231
tone.

1037
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,649
And not only did she is get a

1038
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,193
good lead for them, but she wore

1039
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,153
out Parvati and Rebecca.

1040
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,071
I mean, it's frustrating.

1041
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:38,284
But it just ended up that way.

1042
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,119
>> PROBST: Brad, one of the

1043
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,454
things that Raro has always

1044
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,122
prided itself on was its

1045
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,999
physical strength.

1046
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,834
Well, today you don't match up

1047
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,294
as well to Aitu, maybe, as you

1048
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,212
thought.

1049
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,172
>> They may have a stronger team

1050
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,674
pound for pound, maybe.

1051
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,759
But I think it's not about one

1052
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,177
particular challenge.

1053
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,512
You should really look at the

1054
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,013
bigger picture-- who is working

1055
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:00,431
their ass off at camp and who is

1056
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,682
trying to get along with

1057
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,850
everyone, who's biting their

1058
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,810
tongue when they want to say

1059
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,143
something.

1060
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,269
>> PROBST: Christina, is there a

1061
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,522
little feeling of a sinking

1062
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,690
ship, loss after loss?

1063
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,275
>> I don't think so.

1064
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,652
You know what?

1065
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:13,528
Sometimes when you lose, you

1066
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,445
lose, you lose.

1067
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,321
But that doesn't mean you're

1068
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,280
completely done.

1069
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,323
I mean, we still have a chance.

1070
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,282
You know, we've just got to keep

1071
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,158
our heads up high, and it will

1072
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,326
be our time to shine.

1073
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,161
>> PROBST: Brad, Christina took

1074
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,329
a little criticism at the last

1075
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,455
tribal council.

1076
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,542
Did you feel badly for her?

1077
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,668
>> I did.

1078
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,919
I did feel badly for Christina,

1079
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,545
because I believe that everyone

1080
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,295
deserves the benefit of the

1081
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,296
doubt.

1082
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,297
And sometimes things are better

1083
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,298
left unsaid.

1084
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,175
And unfortunately it had to come

1085
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,301
up in tribal council last night

1086
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,177
in front of everyone.

1087
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,264
>> PROBST: Jenny, when you got

1088
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,307
back to camp, what went down?

1089
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,143
>> Well, she was angry.

1090
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,936
You know, people in our group

1091
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,146
plain out said, "You're

1092
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,565
annoying."

1093
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,024
You know, I can understand how

1094
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,234
she felt.

1095
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,861
I know that it was embarrassing.

1096
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,737
It was a shock for her.

1097
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,030
But the way the feelings were

1098
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,240
with the tribe, I mean, how can

1099
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,575
you say something and not offend

1100
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,826
her?

1101
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,327
>> PROBST: Christina, you didn't

1102
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,579
take it well when you got back

1103
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,955
to camp.

1104
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,331
>> It bothered me because I

1105
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,750
think they're my friends and I

1106
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,960
let my guard down, I guess.

1107
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,586
And you know, I don't want to,

1108
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,379
like, beat a dead horse, but

1109
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,547
it's definitely a blow.

1110
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,549
And this morning we competed and

1111
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,551
I felt I gave it my all still,

1112
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,011
whether what happened last night

1113
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,387
happened.

1114
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,513
>> PROBST: Adam, did you feel

1115
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,681
that from Christina?

1116
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,348
Today's challenge, did she

1117
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,976
feel like a unified part of this

1118
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,144
tribe?

1119
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:28,603
>> I think she did.

1120
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,270
I think she worked really hard

1121
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,271
during the challenge.

1122
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,231
It's not as if she wasn't

1123
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:32,773
contributing to the tribe or

1124
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,442
anything like that.

1125
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,902
It's more of... her personality,

1126
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,862
it just clashes with ours.

1127
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,321
She can't change that.

1128
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,615
That's just of the way she is.

1129
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,450
>> PROBST: Nate, this was once a

1130
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,868
big, happy tribe.

1131
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,410
It's now dwindling.

1132
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,412
You're going to lose another

1133
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,413
member tonight.

1134
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,497
At a certain point people will

1135
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,540
start going, "I've got to look

1136
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,791
out for myself."

1137
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,250
>> Oh, yeah, most def.

1138
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,336
It's survival mode.

1139
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,337
You know, you're always

1140
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,422
thinking, like, "Well, worst

1141
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,506
case scenario, you know, it

1142
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,633
comes down to this and that."

1143
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,634
You know, you're playing

1144
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,593
scenarios.

1145
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,594
But I think right now we're kind

1146
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,845
of like... we want to be the

1147
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,221
fourth quarter crew that comes

1148
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,514
back, you know, from behind and

1149
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,183
just, you know, smokes them out.

1150
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,436
>> PROBST: Okay.

1151
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,896
Before we vote, there's one more

1152
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,689
twist to tonight's tribal

1153
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,982
council.

1154
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,817
Aitu, you will now kidnap one

1155
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,237
member from the Raro tribe.

1156
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,578
>> What do you mean "kidnap"?

1157
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,038
>> PROBST: They will be immune

1158
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,581
from tonight's tribal council.

1159
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,916
They will come over to your

1160
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,834
side, sit with you.

1161
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,419
They will have a plate of food.

1162
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,380
They will return to camp with

1163
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,132
you and they will be a part of

1164
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,259
your tribe through the next

1165
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,427
reward challenge.

1166
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,805
Quietly confer, then I'll ask

1167
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,431
you for the name.

1168
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,650
>> PROBST: Aitu, who are you

1169
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:02,780
going to kidnap?

1170
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,198
>> Nate.

1171
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,199
>> PROBST: Nate, grab your

1172
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:06,075
torch.

1173
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:06,701
There's a spot for it down just

1174
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,411
off the path.

1175
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,413
Grab your bag.

1176
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,421
>> Welcome, Nate.

1177
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,549
>> Watch out for sauce.

1178
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,884
>> PROBST: I owe you some food.

1179
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,011
You won't have a lot of time to

1180
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,345
eat it, so dig in.

1181
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,432
There's your cider.

1182
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:35,354
Okay.

1183
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,356
Now we get to your vote.

1184
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,441
If somebody has the hidden

1185
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,942
immunity idol and it turns out

1186
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,068
you need to play it, you will

1187
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,528
present it to me after the vote.

1188
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,698
Jenny, you're up.

1189
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:05,885
>> (<i> whispering</i> ) You're a nice

1190
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:06,677
woman, but our tribe is stronger

1191
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,430
without you.

1192
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,828
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1193
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,622
votes.

1194
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,886
Before we get to the vote, Aitu,

1195
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,179
time for you to go.

1196
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,180
Grab your torches and head back

1197
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,599
to camp.

1198
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,906
Let's get to it.

1199
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:09,949
Once the votes are read, the

1200
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:10,866
decision is final.

1201
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,076
The person voted out will be

1202
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,035
asked to leave the tribal

1203
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,661
council area immediately.

1204
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,540
I'll read the votes.

1205
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:22,086
First vote, Jenny.

1206
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,671
Christina.

1207
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,464
One vote Christina, one vote

1208
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,425
Jenny.

1209
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,386
Jenny.

1210
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:30,928
Two votes Jenny, one vote

1211
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,265
Christina.

1212
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,599
Christina.

1213
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,643
We're tied two votes Christina,

1214
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,645
two votes Jenny.

1215
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,273
Christina.

1216
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,482
That's three votes Christina,

1217
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,819
two votes Jenny.

1218
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:50,072
Seventh person voted out of the

1219
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,908
Cook Islands, Christina.

1220
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,118
Unless you have the immunity

1221
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,119
idol, you need to bring me your

1222
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,745
torch.

1223
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,713
Christina, the tribe has spoken.

1224
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,341
It's time for you to go.

1225
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,563
Well, you got rid of J.P.

1226
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,064
because you didn't trust him.

1227
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,941
You got rid of Steph because her

1228
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,276
heart wasn't in it.

1229
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:27,902
Tonight you got rid of Christina

1230
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,112
because she just didn't fit in.

1231
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,363
Three votes, three very

1232
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,698
different reasons.

1233
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,158
Grab your torches, head back to

1234
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,284
camp.

1235
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,244

page and know what is going on.

1250
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,770
about the fact that we were

1251
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,771
having this conversation right

1252
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,939

>> PROBST: And one exiled

1257
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,697
Survivor takes a beating.

1258
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,663
>> I really enjoyed being

1259
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,164
on<i> Survivor.</i>

1260
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:22,706
It was a great experience.

1261
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,792
I was just disappointed I got

1262
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,709
voted off so soon.

1263
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,920
Basically I almost feel like I

1264
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:28,879
was taken advantage of.

1265
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:29,755
But you know what?

1266
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,673
I met some really good people,

1267
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,590
and I met some really awful

1268
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:31,799
people.

1269
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,550
But I guess that's part of the

1270
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,677
game.

1271
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,678
But it was just an awesome

1272
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,138
experience overall.
