00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,088
<i>Survivor:</i>
After helping to vote out

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,590
Andrew, Lill was feeling good
about turning on her former

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,093
Morgan Tribe.
>> Usually I have regrets

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,555
stabbing someone in the back.
This time, I feel like

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,765
I stood up for myself.
>> PROBST: At the reward

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,225
challenge...
Fire.

8
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,061
...Rupert had the sharpest aim.
There it is!

9
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,021
>> Yes!
>> PROBST: Rupert wins reward!

10
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,232
But decided to give
the reward away.

11
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,609
>> Burton gave me the
immunity last night.

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,987
I'll give him the breakfast.
>> PROBST: Burton, you're

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,822
going to breakfast
and you're taking

14
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,284
somebody with you.
Burton chose Lill to join him

15
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,953
for a breakfast feast.
>> Oh, my Lord.

16
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,831
>> PROBST: They indulged.
>> To the outcasts.

17
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,958
>> To the outcasts.
>> PROBST: And Burton hatched a

18
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,127
plan to get rid of Rupert.
>> We've got to get

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,129
Rupert off right now.
Okay, so you need to

20
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,298
make friends with Christa and
say, "Listen, I'm going along

21
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,468
with whatever you guys want."
>> Well, see, now, it's starting

22
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,928
to lie and I'm going
to have a problem with that.

23
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,014
>> PROBST: At the immunity
challenge, Rupert guaranteed

24
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:00,685
himself three more days
by defeating all the others.

25
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,354
And with that,
Rupert has immunity.

26
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,983
( laughing )
Back at camp,

27
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,486
Ryno was feeling vulnerable
and tried some last minute

28
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,989
strategizing.
I could get the two girls,

29
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:15,825
and if you could get Lill,
you know, we kind of

30
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,161
control our own destiny.
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

31
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,997
Council...
Ryan.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,168
Ryno was voted out.
>> I'll be back, guys.

33
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,796
>> PROBST: He became the first
member of the jury.

34
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:33,510
Eight are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

39
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:05,101
>> Nighttime is my one bad time.
If I could go just 39 days

40
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:09,814
and never have to sleep,
I would make this beautifully.

41
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:16,446
But nighttime is killing me.
( quietly ): Just got to make it

42
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,615
through another day.
And another and another

43
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:23,411
and another and another...
At night out here,

44
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,623
I start thinking about family.
That's when I miss my family.

45
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:32,086
( thunder crashing )
I tell Laura, my wife,

46
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,674
all my woes and sorrows,
all my triumphs.

47
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:44,057
I tell Laura everything.
And I want for everyone to see

48
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,519
I am the best damn survivor
that has ever been.

49
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:53,483
I am it.
I know they will.

50
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,818
Shouldn't think that way,
I know.

51
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,654
I know.
I know. I know.

52
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,115
I hear you.
I hear you.

53
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,493
Take it down
to the one or two people

54
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,620
that I truly,
really care about.

55
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,705
I care about Sandra
and Christa.

56
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:12,210
They care about me.
It's very hard keeping

57
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,171
mentally aware of everything
that's going on around here.

58
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:21,386
I try to guide everything
that goes on on my island.

59
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,764
I try to direct
everyone's actions

60
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,601
while keeping myself grounded
and aware of what is going on

61
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,187
and what I am doing,
not settling ever

62
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,857
for anything but first.
And letting everybody here

63
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:41,864
realize that they are finishing
in places of honor.

64
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:48,871
To build them up to be a winner
and still lose...

65
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:58,923
that's a hard mental battle.
>> Beebee.

66
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:08,725
that's a hard mental battle.
>> Beebee.

67
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,060
>> Thank you, baby.
( chuckling )

68
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:16,357
>> I know.
( kisses )

69
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,901
Blah, blah.
>> Honestly, Rupert and Christa

70
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,864
are making me sick with their,
"Baby, baby, beebee, beebee,"

71
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,742
blah, blah, blah.
( Rupert laughing )

72
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,244
>> I know.
>> I've been saying this

73
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,788
in my head and I...
I've never... I haven't vocally

74
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,249
expressed this thought,
but I feel, uh, Rupert,

75
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,585
Christa and Sandra
have gotten to the point of...

76
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,587
of the old saying,
"Absolute power

77
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,965
corrupts absolutely."
They are so power-ridden,

78
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,551
they know it, that they feel
that they're above the law.

79
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:48,056
>> Jon and I will be back
in about 15, 20 minutes.

80
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,641
>> That's very good.
>> Burton and I decided to go

81
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,103
on a... well, we decided
to talk a little strategy,

82
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,649
knowing that the bond between
Christa, Rupert and Sandra

83
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,110
pretty much puts us
at fourth and fifth.

84
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,279
Like, to hand-feed me
number four and say, "Jon,

85
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,282
be happy. It's number four."
No. That's not going

86
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,868
to make me happy.
>> We need to be starting

87
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:14,791
to chat up with D and T.
Just be like, "Hey, listen.

88
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,252
You guys know you're going.
"If we can knock Rupert off,

89
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,757
we can break this triad deal."
If we can take him

90
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,842
out now, we need to.
>> Mm-hmm.

91
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,261
>> But, we need to...
We just need to start

92
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,306
getting a foundation
with D and T.

93
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,475
>> Once again, Jonny Fairplay
finds himself

94
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,437
in a great position.
He can either go with Plan A:

95
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,148
Christa, Rupert, Sandra,
and Burton, or Plan B:

96
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:44,070
Burton, D, T, and Lill.
And, uh, I'm throwing

97
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,657
all my eggs in choice "B."
You know, if the bases are

98
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,326
loaded and, you know, you got
three people saying, "Hey,

99
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,495
bunt"... Screw you, man.
This is my chance

100
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,164
to knock a grand slam.
>> Rupert would be scrambling.

101
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,835
The thing is he will be
livid, like, beyond belief.

102
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,213
>> I know.
>> The problem is it's more

103
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,716
risky to flip the alliance now
and to go against Rupert,

104
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,219
Chris and Sandra.
If I go this other way,

105
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,013
I have a much better chance,
but if I get caught

106
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,808
and the cover is blown,
it's not going to be

107
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,185
a good thing.
That's why we've got to start

108
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,812
talking to those girls,
'cause right now,

109
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,356
we're about to get screwed, too.
I talked to Lill about this

110
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,986
and I've talked to Jon about it.
So, we didn't know when to tell

111
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,029
Tijuana and Darrah
what the plan is to flip

112
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:37,081
on our original alliance.
>> It's empty.

113
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:42,420
on our original alliance.
>> It's empty.

114
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:49,802
>> Good boy.
>> I think I need to go fishing.

115
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,728
>> Good luck, Rupe.
>> All right, let's get

116
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:03,691
that big-ass shark today.
Big-ass shark steaks.

117
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,904
I have to go out and get fish.
I would love it if I was

118
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,406
a mean-ass son of a bitch
and just went out

119
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:14,202
and got fish for myself.
But, so, what do you do?

120
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:19,749
You go out and get fish.
>> Days can't pass by fast

121
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:26,380
enough, you know?
>> They're gone.

122
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,217
>> Burton and I found ourselves
with an opportunity--

123
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,219
everyone else there
with Rupert fishing

124
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,471
and Sandra and Christa
going to get lemons.

125
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,431
I looked at Burton,
Burton looked at me.

126
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,558
He was like,
"You think now's the time?"

127
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:52,448
I was like, "Absolutely."
>> A shark appears,

128
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:56,827
and I'm like, "Ah, I want him.
I want him, bad."

129
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,288
But, the only way
I'm taking that shot

130
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,958
is if I can get
directly over him,

131
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,126
hit him straight down
in the head

132
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,338
and hold that spear into him.
Because, if not, he's going

133
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:19,350
to be gone with my spear.
>> The alliance between Rupert,

134
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,102
Sandra and Christa...
the two of us...

135
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,937
>> It's unbreakable.
>> The two of us are

136
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,772
on the outside.
>> Right.

137
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,983
>> Because, Rupert's threatened
threatened by me, they all--

138
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,402
every single one has told me
they want him out

139
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,529
the second there's a chance.
Bottom line is, if those

140
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,823
three are in at the end,
no one else will be.

141
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,534
Because, Rupert will win
every immunity.

142
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,828
>> And, you know what,
I'd rather have one, two...

143
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,871
well, four, five, four,
three, whatever.

144
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,165
>> Me, too.
>> I would love to have this...

145
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,710
versus that.
>> Here's the key.

146
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,878
Here's the key.
Number one, Rupert goes first.

147
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,047
If he doesn't win immunity,
we go after Christa.

148
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,174
No one can breathe a
word, if we're all...

149
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,385
Oh...
Here it is. Here it is.

150
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,304
>> I have an important...
I have one important...

151
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,514
When they come to us and say,
"Okay, Darrah's next."

152
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,850
>> If they think that I'm going
to be the next one to go,

153
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,852
I'll just play it off like,
"Yeah, I know I am."

154
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,562
>> "There's nothing
I can do about it."

155
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,480
>> Yeah. Okay.
>> Okay, just remember,

156
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,649
we have-- the five of us--
have to stick together until

157
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,027
all three of those are gone.
>> Look, we know it, that's it.

158
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,862
There's no more talking about
it, 'cause someone

159
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,905
could overhear.
( Jon speaks indistinctly )

160
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,991
>> Yeah, you're going
to be here...

161
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,868
>> You're going to be here
for...

162
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,037
Gimme, gimme, gimmegimme.
>> We tell them,

163
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,706
Rupert's going home.
Their eyes

164
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,543
are about as big as the sun.
They can't believe it.

165
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,587
They're like, "Oh, my God!
Thank you guys so much!

166
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,173
Thank you so much!"
So, the game's about to take

167
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,216
a serious, serious change.
>> All right, let's get

168
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,594
some... do some work.
>> I was down in the dumps,

169
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,055
thinking that I was going
to go home, but all of

170
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,265
a sudden, that changed.
And now, I'm just...

171
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:47,563
I'm ready to stay.
>> I almost had a four-foot

172
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:51,859
gray reef shark.
My God, I sure did want

173
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,820
that shark.
I love being the baddest hunter

174
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,531
out there.
I never give up,

175
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:02,453
I never surrender,
I never admit defeat.

176
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,089
>> We got sea mail.
>> We got sea mail?

177
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,216
>> Yup.
>> Read that puppy.

178
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:20,596
Let me see that boat.
"Morgan, Drake and Balboa,

179
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,932
"in their shadows
you'll compete,

180
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,936
"not for gold or silver,
but a reward just as sweet.

181
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,021
"From poop deck
to crow's nest, just

182
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,108
as fast as you please,
"be the best swabbie you can be

183
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,610
for the adventures on the sea."
>> So, we're going to probably

184
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,654
be climbing something
from bottom to top.

185
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,240
>> Yeah.
>> We got tree mail,

186
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,951
and the clue says,
you're going to be following in

187
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,162
the shadows of ancient pirates.
I think I've got a pretty good

188
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,790
shot at it if it's something
that has to do with speed.

189
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,960
If I do win, just to keep the
impression that our alliance

190
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,421
was going strong,
I'll be giving my reward

191
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,091
to Rupert, because he gave me
his last time.

192
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,884
Well, you got one coming
back your direction.

193
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,803
( laughing )
Soon as I can beat you.

194
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,472
( Rupert laughing )
>> The deal between Burton and

195
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,475
I, after I had given him my
bacon, my breakfast,

196
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,647
my wonderful breakfast...
he said he owed me,

197
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,317
and he would pay me back with
the next challenge he wins.

198
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,611
Burton promised me.
It's fine.

199
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,322
It keeps unity between he and I.
It's a deal.

200
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:31,500
It keeps unity in our group.
>> PROBST: Come on, guys.

201
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,670
Let's get to it.
For today's reward challenge,

202
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,881
you'll take part
in an obstacle course

203
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,508
that will move you along
an old pirate shipwreck.

204
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,677
You'll be running
in teams of two.

205
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,389
On my go, both members of a team
will scurry up the fishnet

206
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,100
to the first platform.
When both tribe members

207
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,728
are on the platform,
you'll race up the cargo net,

208
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,355
retrieve a bell, and ring it.
You come down,

209
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,900
your partner goes up,
and also rings the bell.

210
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,444
Using a grappling hook,
you'll then grab a rope

211
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,571
and swing across
to the second platform.

212
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,490
Make your way up
to the crow's nest

213
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,034
where you'll untie a series
of knots

214
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,995
and release a second bell.
Both members must ring the bell.

215
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,373
You then slide down the sail
to the last platform.

216
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,584
At the last platform,
you'll release a sandbag

217
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,045
with a bell striker on it.
Only one person needs

218
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,506
to ring the last bell.
Winning pair moves

219
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,008
into the finals.
Want to know

220
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,719
what you're playing for?
>> Yeah.

221
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,971
>> PROBST: Today's reward
is an adventure day.

222
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,849
You'll go deep-sea fishing.
Anything that you catch,

223
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,227
you keep.
And you'll do it all

224
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,230
aboard this ship.
>> Oh!

225
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,357
>> PROBST: Catamaran.
It'll be yours for the

226
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,567
afternoon.
Any afternoon on a catamaran

227
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,071
needs one thing--
pizza and beer.

228
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,406
>> Oh!
That's what it's all about.

229
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,286
>> See, now, that's worth it.
>> Oh, man.

230
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,250
>> PROBST: We're gonna draw for
teams.

231
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:59,129
>> Oh.
>> PROBST: Burton and Lill once

232
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,257
again paired up together.
Christa and Darrah

233
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,051
working together.
Winner of this heat goes on

234
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,805
to the final.
Survivors ready? Go!

235
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,315
Christa and Burton
both neck and neck.

236
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,858
Burton starting
to pull his bell.

237
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:25,781
Christa getting hers.
Christa and Burton

238
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,617
both have rang the bell.
Burton's down.

239
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,121
Lill and Darrah both going up.
Ring it, Darrah.

240
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,414
There it is.
Get down

241
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,583
and move on.
Darrah's down.

242
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,460
Christa and Darrah moving on.
Lill takes a hard fall.

243
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,754
Christa, using the grappling
hook, gets the rope,

244
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:45,801
and she's off and soaring.
Send the rope back.

245
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,595
Darrah missed it.
She's gonna need

246
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,640
to use the hook.
Darrah right behind Lill.

247
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,311
It's a close race.
You have to untie these knots.

248
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,940
You will release another bell.
Ring it, slide down the sail.

249
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,985
Burton has it almost undone.
Christa right behind him.

250
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,320
It's gonna be a race
to the finish,

251
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,281
to the final platform.
Burton rings it.

252
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:15,831
Lill rings it.
( bell rings )

253
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:18,000
Burton has a sandbag,
getting the bell.

254
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,794
Burton and Lill
move on to the final!

255
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,921
Here we go.
The second heat--

256
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,884
T and Sandra, Rupert and Jon.
Survivors ready?

257
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:34,016
Go!
The girls up the net first.

258
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,977
T up first.
Rupert right behind her.

259
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,188
T grabbing that bell.
Ring it.

260
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,106
Get down.
When she's down,

261
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,359
you go up, Sandra.
Rupert has it.

262
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,319
He rings it.
Got to get down.

263
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,864
Go, Sandra.
Ooh, Rupert takes a hard fall.

264
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,659
That a way.
Down.

265
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,536
You guys are dead even.
Let's go, get that rope.

266
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,081
Go T, go.
Rupert has the rope,

267
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:01,210
flies across, lets it go.
Jon grabs it.

268
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,046
Use that hook, Sandra,
to grab the rope.

269
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,882
Rupert up first
to the crow's nest.

270
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:10,552
Rupert working on the ropes.
T working on her ropes.

271
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,888
Rupert has it.
He rings it.

272
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:16,183
Slides down the sail.
Wow.

273
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,520
Jon, did you ring the bell?
You didn't ring that bell.

274
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:24,733
Jon's got to go back.
Now, Jon rings it.

275
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:29,071
( yelling )
( indistinct chatter )

276
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,116
( bell rings )
You're right back in it.

277
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,244
Somebody grab the slack.
Rupert and Jon

278
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,581
almost there.
Rupert and Jon moving on!

279
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,251
For the final round,
it's Burton and Lill

280
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,088
versus Rupert and Jon.
This time, you will be

281
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,090
retrieving puzzle pieces.
At the first station,

282
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,259
you'll untie a bag
of puzzle pieces.

283
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,594
The second person
will ring the bell.

284
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,680
At the second station,
puzzle pieces.

285
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,099
Second person rings the bell.
At the final station,

286
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,268
use the cutlass,
chop the sandbag.

287
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,228
Attached is a key.
That'll open

288
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,230
your treasure chest.
First team

289
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,275
to complete the puzzle wins.
For reward.

290
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:11,572
Survivors ready?
Go!

291
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,867
Burton up first and up and over.
Burton and Rupert both working

292
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,119
on their first bag
of puzzle pieces.

293
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,954
Rupert has his.
Has to head down

294
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,458
before Jon can head up.
Saw way too much

295
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,127
of Rupert on that.
It's up to Jon and Lill

296
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,422
to ring the bells.
Jon rings the bell.

297
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,801
Lill rings her bell.
Both teams moving on.

298
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:37,848
Rupert across.
Jon across.

299
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,768
Rupert already starting on
the second bag of puzzle pieces.

300
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:46,356
Burton throws the rope back.
Lill takes a face plant.

301
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,484
Rupert has his second bag
of puzzle pieces.

302
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,696
Burton, working fast
on his knot, right behind.

303
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,156
Burton and Lill
right behind them.

304
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,034
Rupert and Jon have their keys.
Let's go.

305
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,661
Go, go, guys.
Wait for Lill.

306
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,706
Chop.
We're dead even.

307
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,459
Rupert and Burton unlocking
their treasure chests.

308
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:10,798
Rupert has his, Burton has his.
Who can complete

309
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,300
the puzzle first?
It is the flag

310
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,177
right above your head.
That's what

311
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,846
you're trying to recreate.
Burton and Lill

312
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,016
making good progress.
You both have the skull

313
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,601
and crossbones.
You're trying to figure out

314
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,354
how to frame it.
No need to force it, guys.

315
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,314
Burton and Lill getting closer
and closer.

316
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,651
Only a few pieces away.
Jon and Rupert catching up,

317
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,362
going to have to hustle.
Look at this--

318
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,032
down to the last piece.
>> Yes!

319
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,827
>> PROBST: Burton and Lill win
reward!

320
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,745
>> Oh, my God!
All right, quit

321
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,624
doing that Lill!
Come on, now.

322
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,382
>> PROBST: Okay,
here's the deal.

323
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,926
Let's review.
Catamaran, deep-sea fishing,

324
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,595
pizza and beer on the boat.
You can keep it for yourself.

325
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,431
If you want to give it up
to somebody else, you can do

326
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,059
that, as well.
>> I want to keep this.

327
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,063
Sorry, guys.
>> Jon.

328
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,731
>> PROBST: All right, Lill's
keeping her reward.

329
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,901
Burton's giving his up to Jon.
( Jon mutters )

330
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,069
>> You better drink
a twelve-pack.

331
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,239
>> I'm going to drink a case.
>> PROBST: Pizza and beer

332
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,699
for Jon and Lill.
Catamaran will

333
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,576
pick you two up.
Head on back.

334
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:33,380
Good effort, everybody.
>> Well, that reward challenge

335
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,924
was not as fun as I had hoped.
That was painful,

336
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,095
painful, painful.
>> I didn't want

337
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,848
to give this reward to Rupert,
because I don't want Rupert

338
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,434
to have any more food than
he can, because, tomorrow,

339
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,729
in the immunity challenge,
I want him to be tired, weak,

340
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,316
injured and hobbling around,
because I want to smoke him.

341
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,069
>> It's just the outside
that stinks of rot and death.

342
00:19:56,153 --> 00:20:01,617
We had so much rot
and death here.

343
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,454
When Burton gave that away
to Jon, and Lill kept it in her

344
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:10,375
hand without even thinking about
it, that showed me that...

345
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:15,631
I might not be as secure
as I am... as I think I am.

346
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,593
Mean scum.
The bastard's going to be ...

347
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,513
( mumbling )
( panting )

348
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,017
Last ... damn thing
I give to Burton...

349
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,980
except a vote.
I may give him a few votes.

350
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:39,154
Rot and death.
>> Rupert deserves to go.

351
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:42,115
( indistinct chatter )
As much as he does

352
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,786
around here...
We're living because of him.

353
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,330
>> I'm sorry.
>> About what?

354
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,999
>> I should have sent you.
I asked them, and they said no.

355
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,210
>> Ah, it's okay, Lill.
You need it, you earned it.

356
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,170
you want it, bad.
>> But that's not it.

357
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:57,339
I went through the first one,
I didn't win.

358
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,759
( sighs )
>> You won, you should go.

359
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,221
>> I feel like ...
>> No.

360
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,556
>> I'm sorry.
It's not right.

361
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,184
You know it isn't, I know
it isn't, and everybody else

362
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,395
knows it isn't.
>> But what's done is done.

363
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:16,692
>> I should have sent
Rupert on this, and I didn't.

364
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,361
Yeah, but I'm such a bitch.
>> No, no. Thank God.

365
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,530
>> Don't say that about God.
( sobbing

366
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,409
>> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

367
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,370
>> Rupert should go.
Rupert would catch fish.

368
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,748
I can't catch fish.
We got to bring back fish.

369
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,751
>> We're going to.
What's... What's the big deal?

370
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,586
We're going to.
That's not a problem.

371
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,047
We're bringing plenty of fish.
They're gonna be happy.

372
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,216
>> T and Sandra's looking at me
like I'm a scum.

373
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:45,262
I don't want to make anybody
mad, I don't want

374
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,724
to get anybody upset,
but I'm just not that good

375
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,518
at the game.
I don't go on

376
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,478
vacations all the time.
I can't afford

377
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,231
to do these kind of things.
If I had a chance

378
00:21:56,314 --> 00:22:00,027
to sail on a beautiful boat,
that's what was in my mind.

379
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,532
I've never done anything
like that before.

380
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,535
>> Every single thing
is hinging on

381
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,038
yours and my relationship.
>> I know.

382
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,750
>> And... I know it's a game,
and I know it's backstabbing...

383
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,252
>> Because there's no point.
There's no way either one of us

384
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,755
can beat anyone else
as soon as we go through

385
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,923
with what we do tomorrow.
There's no way.

386
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,092
I know that. You know that.
That's it.

387
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,802
>> But, like...
I'll admit, I am putting

388
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,722
100% of my faith in you.
You and I just have

389
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,432
to control everything
from here on out.

390
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,934
And as long as the two of us
can get Lill to vote with us,

391
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,561
there's three people.
>> Oh, we're fine.

392
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,481
>> And we're fine.
Yes, all right.

393
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,616
>> I heard Burton and Jon
talking in the bushes.

394
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,786
Jon is going to work
his magic on Lill

395
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:55,499
the whole boat ride.
>> If they turn, we're all dead.

396
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,584
If they...
>> It's not turning,

397
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,295
it's just that they want her
in the palm of their hand.

398
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,423
What kind of game is he going
to play on her on the boat?

399
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,010
>> It doesn't matter.
Lill will come back,

400
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,346
and I will talk to Lill.
I talk to Lill

401
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,432
every morning for hours.
>> You going to ask her

402
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,017
what they talked about?
>> Yep.

403
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,144
I'm going to ask her exactly
what they talked about.

404
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:20,482
And she will tell me.
>> Lill?

405
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:25,654
Time to go.
>> Got to find out what's going

406
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,697
on.
My only hope is

407
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:32,160
when Lill comes back,
she looks me in the eye

408
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,956
and tells me
what Jon is talking about.

409
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,676
>> Oh, yes.
>> Oh, my goodness.

410
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,178
>> Cheers.
>> Cheers.

411
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,140
>> To the final three.
>> To the final three.

412
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,350
>> I have never ever
been on anything

413
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:59,187
anywhere near this boat.
Who's the captain?

414
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,731
>> Hola, señor.
El capitán.

415
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,192
Oh, you're glad you didn't
give this bad boy

416
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,861
up now, aren't you?
>> I don't know,

417
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,029
the ramifications...
>> There are no ramifications.

418
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,365
I have everything worked out
and we have all day

419
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,701
to discuss it,
so you will have no more

420
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,703
questions and there'll be
no more talk at camp

421
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,496
between anybody.
So, the only thing

422
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,748
that can hurt us...
>> You just need to let me know

423
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,709
what's going on.
>> I'm going to tell you

424
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,711
everything today, and when
we leave here, you will have

425
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,588
no more questions.
>> All right.

426
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,715
You may have to tell me
a couple times.

427
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,925
>> Okay. Here's the deal.
First: Rupert.

428
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,886
If Rupert's not available,
then Christa.

429
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,889
>> Yeah, but I have a lot
of guilt.

430
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,891
You don't, I do.
>> Please, you... you have to

431
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,560
check that guilt at the door, or
else quit this game right now.

432
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,228
Cheers. Are you happy?
>> I'm happy.

433
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,106
>> You should be,
you're final three.

434
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,245
>> I smell Cerveza.
>> Oh, my gosh.

435
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:02,083
>> Yes, sir!
Thank you very much, sir.

436
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,586
You drink beer, Lill?
>> Not a whole lot.

437
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,671
>> Well, I'll be happy
to finish that for you.

438
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,925
I think you know that.
Oh, you're the man!

439
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,928
>> Oh, my gosh! Oh!
>> We got veggies over there,

440
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,472
and we got a whole meat
over here.

441
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,225
>> Simple-made things
make me very excitable.

442
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,478
( laughs )
>> I need to date women like

443
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,772
you.
>> Hey.

444
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,191
>> Mmm...
>> Mmm...

445
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,610
>> This is the best part
of this entire game.

446
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:40,288
Right here.
>> You know how much I like

447
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,291
myself?
Seeing how good I look right now

448
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:48,588
is a great thing.
Oh. Man.

449
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,092
>> Square knot.
I am the Scout Master.

450
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,386
Woo-hoo!
>> You're drunk, Lill.

451
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,763
>> I've had three-quarters
of a beer.

452
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:06,815
>> I think you're drunk.
>> What happens if I get one?

453
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:13,947
>> I think you're drunk.
>> What happens if I get one?

454
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,366
>> Uh, reel it in.
>> I would really like

455
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,536
to bring some home.
>> Yeah.

456
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,213
>> Whoo-hoo.
>> Any fish?

457
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:35,719
>> Yeah.
We fished the entire time.

458
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,180
>> See, they kind of fished for
us, and they threw out

459
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,433
the fishing hooks in the back
and... nothing.

460
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,226
>> Yeah, you just
trolled around.

461
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,980
When Jon and Lill came back
from their catamaran,

462
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,191
I just sucked Lill in quickly
and told her, "You stick with me

463
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,069
and you could be top two."
You know, "It could be you

464
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,822
and me."
How many other times have you

465
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,992
been on the winning team?
I tried to figure out

466
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,869
what Jon was talking
to her about

467
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,955
and if Jon was going to try
and suck her in and get her in

468
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,833
some kind of alliance.
>> No, no.

469
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,711
>> And she said "no."
I know now that Lill

470
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:14,466
will be wholehearted with me.
I wanted to hug and kiss her.

471
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:38,615
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Okay.

472
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:43,244
Rupert, for the second time,
I take this away from you.

473
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,248
Once again,
Immunity back up for grabs.

474
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,876
Okay, let's get to
today's challenge.

475
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,545
It is based on an old dart game
called "Killer."

476
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,131
Your first goal: become a
Killer, and you do that

477
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,092
by hitting your own color
on the target.

478
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,427
Once you're a Killer,
you can start attacking

479
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,263
other tribe members.
Each time a Killer hits

480
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,392
another tribe member's color,
they lose one, two

481
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,895
or three of their lives,
depending if they're hit

482
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,939
in the single,
the double or the triple

483
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,483
section of the target.
Once your lives are gone,

484
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,236
you're out of the game.
Last person left on the board...

485
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,614
wins Immunity.
To make it a little more fun,

486
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:23,743
you won't be throwing darts...
you'll be using a blowgun.

487
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,287
We'll draw numbers
to pick your spot.

488
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:34,629
We'll get started.
First up: Lill.

489
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:37,507
Get a lung full of air
and make yourself a Killer.

490
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,592
So, your goal is
to hit your own color,

491
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,721
activate your Killer status.
Not enough;

492
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,349
going to need a little more air.
Next up: T.

493
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:50,645
Give it a good blow.
>> Oh, that sucked.

494
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:53,189
>> PROBST: Darrah trying to hit
her color.

495
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:58,153
Nope.
Jon.

496
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,822
Rupert!
Step up and show them

497
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,159
how it's done.
It's as easy as that--

498
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,453
Rupert is on the board
as our first Killer.

499
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,705
>> Thank you.
>> PROBST: Burton looking

500
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,833
to hit brown.
Look at that!

501
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,668
>> Good job, Burton.
>> PROBST: Burton follows right

502
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:16,629
behind.
Burton now a Killer.

503
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,216
Sandra.
You hit Sandra,

504
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:26,222
but you're not a Killer.
Doesn't count.

505
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,808
There it is!
Jon's on the board.

506
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:32,020
Jon is a Killer.
Rupert.

507
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,606
Darrah takes two hits.
You lose one life

508
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:39,861
and you lose a second life;
Darrah down to her Safety.

509
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,823
Burton gives T a hit.
>> Ooh!

510
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,658
>> Thank God.
Sandra hits herself with

511
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,370
a double and becomes a Killer.
Good shot, but you're not a

512
00:29:49,454 --> 00:30:01,049
Killer-- doesn't count.
Jon hits Christa with a triple.

513
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,720
Christa, one life...
two life... three life.

514
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,889
>> My bad.
>> PROBST: Christa's out of the

515
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,391
game, have a seat on the bench.
>> Sorry.

516
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,062
>> That was quick.
>> PROBST: Darrah takes two

517
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:18,233
hits, you lose your last life,
Darrah, have a seat next to

518
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,070
Christa, you're out of the game.
Burton has Killer status.

519
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,947
Looking to put some pain
on somebody.

520
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,283
And he does
with a triple on Rupert.

521
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:32,205
Rupert loses Killer status...
one life...

522
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,415
and a second life.
And with one hit,

523
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:41,923
Rupert is down to one last life.
( mouths word )

524
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:46,427
>> PROBST: Rupert takes his last
hit.

525
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:56,479
Rupert, out of the game.
T. takes a double hit.

526
00:30:56,563 --> 00:31:01,609
Rupert, out of the game.
T. takes a double hit.

527
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,113
T., you lose this life
and you lose your last life,

528
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,657
your Safety.
T.is out of the game.

529
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,618
Have a seat on the bench.
>> He kills me again.

530
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:17,125
>> Oh...
>> Son of a...

531
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,627
>> PROBST: Burton hits a triple
on Sandra.

532
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,923
Sandra, now down
to your last life.

533
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,883
Sandra hits Burton.
>> I wish that counted, too.

534
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:31,431
>> PROBST: But you're not a
Killer.

535
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,474
Burton hits Sandra and,
just like that,

536
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,145
Sandra loses her last life.
Take a seat on the bench.

537
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,481
We're down to three:
Jon, Lill, Burton.

538
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,824
Burton gives a triple shot
to Jon and, like that,

539
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:53,953
Jon loses one life...
two life...

540
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,955
and the third life.
Jon, have a seat,

541
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,499
you're out of the game.
>> It was a pleasure having me.

542
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,169
( chuckles )
>> PROBST: Once again,

543
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:06,215
we're down to a familiar pair:
Lill and Burton.

544
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,885
Burton.
All you have to do is

545
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,471
hit light blue anywhere,
Lill's out of the game,

546
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:17,685
you're going home with Immunity.
Takes his aim.

547
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,856
Lillian, out of the game.
>> Oh, my heart.

548
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:25,526
>> PROBST: Burton wins
Immunity-- again.

549
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,862
Burton, come on over.
You've had this

550
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,656
around you before.
>> I have.

551
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,867
>> PROBST: Turn around
and put it on.

552
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,078
Safe from tonight's vote.
Three more days out here.

553
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,288
Valuable Immunity.
As you know,

554
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,540
if you wish to assign it
to somebody else, you can.

555
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,542
You have this afternoon
to think about it.

556
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,171
You guys can head back to camp.
>> Thank you.

557
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:31,801
>> The immunity challenge
pissed the hell out of me.

558
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:36,806
I know I was clearly
the best dart-blower there.

559
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,392
And they knocked me out
so damn quick.

560
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,562
My own team, Burton and Sandra,
knocked me out.

561
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:47,567
Sandra truly was a mistake.
I don't blame her at all.

562
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,195
Burton, he knew
what the hell he was doing.

563
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,322
>> You and I, we'll
go all the way.

564
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,950
>> I know, dude.
>> Like, I don't want to be in

565
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,952
the final with anyone else...
>> There's no one here.

566
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,912
There's no one else.
>> ...for a number of reasons.

567
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,789
But, if nothing else,
I want to hang out

568
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,791
with you that last day.
>> Exactly.

569
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,626
>> I want you and I
partying our ass off.

570
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,628
>> Exactly, man.
I'm pretty happy right now

571
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,422
in that, uh, Rupert's
going home tonight.

572
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,924
Although, I promised him
that I wouldn't write

573
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,135
his name down again,
promises, to me,

574
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,971
uh, can be broken
about as easily as a fat woman

575
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,849
on wicker furniture.
It's that simple.

576
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,159
>> I love... I love
shell collecting.

577
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,328
I got tons of shells.
>> Good therapy.

578
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,331
>> Yes.
>> What needs to be done?

579
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,792
>> Shell collecting.
>> I better get on

580
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,836
my shell collecting, then.
Burton and Jon keep

581
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,633
pounding into my head--
this is a game!

582
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:59,639
But I'd love to keep Rupert,
because I love that man.

583
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,517
>> It's the same.
It's the same. It's the same.

584
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,727
>> Yep.
>> We target the Morgans first

585
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,729
and we got to get Darrah
and Tijuana out

586
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,482
before any of them,
so they won't pass that damn

587
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,193
immunity between each other.
Darrah is still acting

588
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,821
like she's ready to go
and packing and saying

589
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,032
her good-byes.
But that could all be an act.

590
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,034
Luckily, I have Lill
on my side,

591
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:22,703
I have Sandra on my side
and I have Christa on my side.

592
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,749
Lill has been the key figure
in a lot of votes lately.

593
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,962
Is it still going to be Darrah?
>> Uh, I don't care.

594
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,590
I... I've said from the get-go,
it doesn't make ... to me.

595
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,051
>> Okay. Okay.
I'm going to go get dressed.

596
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,554
If they've turned
and they've gotten

597
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,098
Darrah, T, Jon and Burton
together on one side,

598
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,892
I've got my four on my side
and we will have a tie.

599
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,395
We five stand strong together.
>> That was my point

600
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,522
the whole time.
>> Burton said "yeah."

601
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,732
I want to see Sandra say "yeah"
and look at me.

602
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,193
>> I'm good.
>> I want to see you say "yeah."

603
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,237
>> I'll give you
a "hell, yeah."

604
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,906
>> The vibe at the camp
is that everybody's agreed

605
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,201
upon Darrah going home.
Maybe Burton figured out

606
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,287
that there was a way
between him and Jon

607
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,997
to get together
and outmaneuver us three.

608
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,583
But I don't see it happening.
I just can't see it happening,

609
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,459
because all along they've said,
"It's going to be

610
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,254
the strong five
and we'll separate from there."

611
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,954
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
the first member of the jury,

612
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,290
Ryno.
Voted out at the

613
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:56,756
last Tribal Council.
Ryno is here merely to observe.

614
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,300
He's just gathering information
to help him make a very

615
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,886
important vote at the final
Tribal Council.

616
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,139
Okay. 27 days--
that's a long time

617
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:08,643
to be out here.
Sandra, is there anybody

618
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,271
in this tribe you couldn't
survive without?

619
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,191
Why Rupert?
>> Rupert is the only one

620
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,652
that brings fish,
with the exception of the one

621
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,446
that Burton brought.
But Burton brings in stingrays.

622
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:25,952
Um, we'd be assed-out if it
wasn't for Rupert, assed-out.

623
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,371
>> PROBST: Lill,
how important is Rupert's

624
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,124
fish-catching abilities?
>> It is very important to us,

625
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,920
but we also have another person
who does do fishing.

626
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:39,006
>> PROBST: Burton, is there
or is there not a

627
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,883
little competition
to be the alpha male

628
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,928
between you and Rupert?
>> No, I don't believe so.

629
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,931
I mean, Rupert has definitely
caught more fish than I have.

630
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,809
But there's no doubt
in my mind that if one of us

631
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,186
got struck by lightning,
the tribe would get by.

632
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:55,856
>> PROBST: Sandra, you have
become your own society,

633
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,859
complete with leaders
and followers.

634
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,321
Who here is getting a free ride?
>> Let it be known

635
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,491
that Jon wakes up at noon
and then he goes

636
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,743
under the bushes.
He has this secret spot where

637
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,913
he takes an additional nap.
I have yet to see him wash

638
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,583
a dish or even clean a fish.
>> PROBST: Jon, she pointed

639
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,169
a big, old, fat finger at you.
>> That's fine.

640
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,715
She gives me a headache.
So, I could care less.

641
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,342
It's all about her.
>> PROBST: What's that, Jon?

642
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,304
>> It's all about her.
>> PROBST: Okay.

643
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,223
Darrah, you seem
like you've given up

644
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:32,393
to me.
If you're going home tonight,

645
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,397
surprised?
No, not surprised at all.

646
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,566
>> PROBST: Disappointed?
>> Um, yeah, disappointed,

647
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,236
but not surprised.
>> PROBST: All right, guys.

648
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:45,072
Burton, you have immunity.
It's yours to keep

649

Uh, I think I'll keep it.

Christa, you're up.

655
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,650

675

Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

680
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,997
with some devastating news.
>> Love you, Jonny.

tribe does the unthinkable.

00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,258
thing I've... I've seen
since this game has begun.

685
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,468
I got nothing to say

It is insane how bad I needed

690
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,648
this.
This would have made my life

691
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,776
a lot better.
I always get hurt

692
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,821
trusting people.
I want so badly to be accepted

693
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,991
and I never get
the acceptance that I want.

694
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:02,663
I don't fit.
So much for my dreams.
