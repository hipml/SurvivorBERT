1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,556
What was the... point?

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,006
He's literally an idiot.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,286
No one's gonna trust q from now on.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,106
Karma is a bitch.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,440
Previously on survivor

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,626
that now we could pull off a blindside.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,836
Everyone is so distracted, I could

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,836
drive something that's a little risky.

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,486
The idol has zero value to me now.

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,386
- I'm ready to burn it on the spot.
- Right.

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,936
Tiff's gonna play her idol, so now

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,080
we've got to figure out what
the heck we're gonna do.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,860
I'm beginning to feel pretty nervous.

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,620
So I am 100% playing my idol.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,216
If anybody has an advantage or an idol,

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,480
and you want to play it, now
would be the time to do so.

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,456
All right, I'll read the votes.

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,456
Tenth person voted out

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,680
and the third member
of our jury... hunter.

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,726
Hunter, the tribe has spoken.

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,620
Yes, they have.

23
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,000
There it is in all of its splendor.

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,596
After tribal council, I was so ticked off.

25
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,036
No one told me there was a split vote

26
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,416
between q and hunter.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,796
And so I am trying to...

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,556
Hold my composure so I don't explode,

29
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,726
but I'm thinking, "what
the heck, you ho-bags?"

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,936
How y'all feeling? Y'all okay?

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,596
I just want to know what is it about me

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,766
that made y'all say, "no,
we don't want to let Liz in

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,316
on the split vote"?

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,936
Honestly, Liz, everything happened

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,216
ten minutes before
tribal, and there was...

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,976
- By the time...
- Is that true?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,316
- That is straight-up what happened.
- That's straight-up.

38
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,006
Well, damn.

39
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,316
We thought he had an idol,

40
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,106
and we was like, "all right, well,

41
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,486
just in case, let's just split the votes."

42
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,246
They're like, "how
are we gonna do that?"

43
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,301
We're like, "well, Liz is already voting..."

44
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:18,486
Okay.

45
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,036
'Cause I felt stupid as...

46
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,286
We said, "Liz is already voting with you."

47
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,836
Like, stupid as... just now.

48
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,416
Considering I was the only person

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,796
left out of this vote, I feel pretty dumb.

50
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,766
On top of that, I wanted to get q out.

51
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,906
He did almost blow up my game,

52
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,796
and he's not someone that
I can trust moving forward.

53
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,106
Hunter's also got to be crazy
to not see that blindside coming.

54
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,340
If he had an idol, he
should have played it.

55
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,036
No, he overplayed his
hand and he thought,

56
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,656
"I can save this for the next time

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,596
because clearly everyone
hates q right now."

58
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,036
Tonight,

59
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,656
tribal erupted as Jeff predicted it would.

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,416
Once again, q was causing chaos,

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,316
and because of that,

62
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,556
it kind of threw hunter off the scent.

63
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,246
If he did have an idol,

64
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,766
I guess the smokescreen was so good

65
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,976
that he didn't play it because now

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,386
our biggest physical threat is on his way

67
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,680
to the jury house.

68
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,006
He's grown. If he wants to...

69
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,416
If he wants to reconcile
things, he could come talk.

70
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,656
At this point, my immediate
next step is to get q out.

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,316
I'm tired of the drama,
I'm tired of the chaos.

72
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,146
That man did too much.

73
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,146
He flew too close to the
sun, and his wings burnt off.

74
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,750
And now he's feeling the pressure.

75
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,726
Is Maria on the beach with q?

76
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,556
Yeah. Maria went to go talk to q, I think.

77
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,286
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

78
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,386
- Okay?
- Come on. Come here.

79
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,906
Right now q is, like,
sitting back in the shadows.

80
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,246
Q is sort of checked
out of the game mentally.

81
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,936
But I think that q still
has some fight in him.

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,246
So, for me, this is a great
opportunity to connect,

83
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,790
but he's a wild card at this point.

84
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,286
I know, basically, I got
to win the rest of the way,

85
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,906
and, you know, I'm cool
with going through like that.

86
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,216
And when I lose, if I go home, I go home.

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,076
At this point, I think
everyone wants me out,

88
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,766
so there's no need for me to go around

89
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,146
and sit around the fire
and talk to these people.

90
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,596
They really don't want to talk to me.

91
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,036
So I'm okay with that.

92
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,726
Right now my strategy
moving forward is,

93
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,796
first win the immunity.

94
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,456
If I can win, and now that
it's in the individual stage,

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,556
I control my own destiny.

96
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,596
I'm not out of this game, trust me.

97
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,680
It might look like it, but it's not.

98
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,656
Yeah.

99
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,766
Q is not only a good person,

100
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,146
but, like, he's also a
number that I can use

101
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,006
to vote with me, and so I

102
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,836
I definitely want to keep him around.

103
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,006
Q's an easy vote.

104
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,316
Everybody wants him out, but in my mind

105
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,216
there are bigger targets here, and so

106
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,246
it may be time to focus
on somebody else.

107
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,076
Good morning.

108
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,036
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Kenzie.

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,316
How do you feel about yesterday's vote?

110
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean, I'm glad it went
the way it did. Like.

111
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,216
I think we can.

112
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,076
I know that this is a hard thought for you,

113
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,726
but I think q would be
willing to work with us,

114
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,246
in that, he told me last night,

115
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,036
"I'm a vote. Use me."

116
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,906
Yesterday the plan was to blindside tiff,

117
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,146
but then we switched it to hunter.

118
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,316
But the biggest thing for
me is that tiff has an idol.

119
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,486
That's not a secret.

120
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,146
And...

121
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,286
Tiffany's sort of been
on my radar for a while.

122
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,316
Evidently, she's still
on Kenzie's radar, too,

123
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,580
which is just music to my ears.

124
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,726
- I want her gone regardless.
- Okay.

125
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,556
Tiff has been my number
one since day one.

126
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,766
We have voted the exact
same way this entire game.

127
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,416
Tiff and I have made
every move together.

128
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,906
We have played almost
the exact same game, so

129
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,456
I've got to differentiate.

130
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,316
I've got to build my résumé,
and a huge checkpoint

131
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,726
on your résumé is voting
out your number one.

132
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,906
That means I just need to be
a little more sneaky than her

133
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,036
to get her out first
before she comes for me.

134
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,100
'Cause I know it's
coming. I know it's coming.

135
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,960
Come on in!

136
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,750
Very quiet today.

137
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,216
- This course... this is crazy.
- Yeah.

138
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,216
- This is day 18, survivor46.
- You're gonna

139
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,626
earn it again.

140
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,456
Yay.

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,386
I got to say, Charlie,

142
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,906
today you all look noticeably smaller.

143
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,626
- Yeah.
- I can see the clothes are big.

144
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,596
Your bodies are shrinking.

145
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,836
Are you starting to feel
that cumulative effect?

146
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,556
Listen, every time I stand up,

147
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,836
I literally feel like I'm
about to faint, you know.

148
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,146
I have to go back down
on my hands and knees.

149
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,000
I've never felt that ever
before in my whole life.

150
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,146
All right, shall we get to
today's reward challenge?

151
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,286
For today's challenge, you're gonna race

152
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,106
through a series of
obstacles until you reach

153
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,286
a sack of sandbags.

154
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,316
You're gonna throw those
sandbags into a net tunnel

155
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,146
and then use your hands
to get 'em out the other side.

156
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,106
Once they're all through,
you'll grab one last sandbag,

157
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,286
go under a net, crawl, and attempt

158
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,820
to land that sandbag on a very tall target.

159
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,976
First person to finish wins reward.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,416
Want to know what you're playing for?

161
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,316
- Yes. - You know we do.
- It's day 18.

162
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,726
You've gone a long time without food.

163
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,216
You passed up the opportunity at rice.

164
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,936
So I know you're gonna be
glad to hear that you're playing

165
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,766
for the biggest reward of the season.

166
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,416
Applebee's.

167
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,556
Yes!

168
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,936
- Wow.
- My god.

169
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,656
My god.

170
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,106
You want burgers?

171
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,386
- Wings. -Yeah.
- Yes.

172
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,906
- I want chicken wings.
- Wings.

173
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,076
- And French fries.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,456
- French fries?
- Yes.

175
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,766
I think we got you covered.

176
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,656
- For real?
- Yes.

177
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,976
Every Wednesday,
my daughter and I have

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,076
- survivor sleepover.
- Wow.

179
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,036
We go directly to
applebee's, I get the burger,

180
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,036
she gets the pizza,
and then we go home.

181
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,286
Then we watch survivor. Yay!

182
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,036
If only you can win this challenge.

183
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,836
All right, let me walk you through

184
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,006
what's in store for the winner.

185
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,386
All the apps you love.

186
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,936
Boneless wings.

187
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,076
Oh, my god.

188
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,246
- Spinach and artichoke dip.
- God.

189
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,386
Chicken quesadillas.

190
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,556
We're just getting started, Charlie.

191
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,456
Perhaps you're interested

192
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,486
in the bourbon street chicken & shrimp.

193
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,596
- Yeah.
- Or maybe you're in the mood,

194
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,246
like Liz, for a burger.

195
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,626
How about the bourbon
street mushroom.

196
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,766
- Swiss burger?
- That's my favorite.

197
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,976
- My god.
- That's 100% ground beef.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,076
It's my favorite one.

199
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,556
Damn.

200
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,386
Smothered in sauteed onions

201
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,286
- and mushrooms.
- Jeff, you're killing us.

202
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,796
- My god.
- Somebody say dessert?

203
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,456
- Yes. Yes. Chocolate. Chocolate.
- The chocolate one

204
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,766
- I was telling you guys about.
- We got some dessert.

205
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,906
How about the oreo cookie shake?

206
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,036
Yeah.

207
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,386
I might eat it even though I'm allergic.

208
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,146
And to close it out,

209
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,146
an applebee's reward
would not be complete

210
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,486
without the shark bowl.

211
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,456
Applebee's rum

212
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,286
cocktail favorite.. Ooh, careful now.

213
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,216
All this can be yours if...
you win this challenge.

214
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,316
All right, we'll draw for spots.

215
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,650
- Get it on. Let's do it.
- Do it.

216
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,106
All right, here we go.

217
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,766
Applebee's. Biggest reward
of the season, survivor46.

218
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,680
Survivors ready?

219
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,580
Go!

220
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,316
You're going over,

221
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,456
over and through with this first obstacle.

222
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,976
Everybody moving quickly.

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,076
Q is out first, then tiff.

224
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,596
Here comes Ben. Start
untying your sandbags.

225
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,596
Charlie's through.

226
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,726
Liz is through.

227
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,510
And Kenzie's... through.

228
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,836
Once all your bags are
out, start launching 'em

229
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,860
in that net tunnel.

230
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,620
Keep tossing.

231
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,146
Q has all his through.

232
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,170
Q in the lead.

233
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,626
Ben is now through.

234
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,976
Tiff is through, working on hers.

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,796
It is q, tiff, Venus, Charlie and Ben.

236
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,146
Maria, Liz and Kenzie still working to get

237
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,170
all their bags in.

238
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,836
Q is through.

239
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,836
He's working on that last sandbag.

240
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,036
That's the money right
there. That's the one

241
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,286
you're going to land on the target.

242
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,246
Day 18, applebee's on the line.

243
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,246
It's q in the lead.

244
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,906
There's tiff.

245
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,106
Q working through that net crawl.

246
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,596
Here goes Maria. She's in it.

247
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,796
Here comes Tiffany.

248
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,386
Everybody else is working
on their sandbags now.

249
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,286
Tiff is moving quickly
through that net crawl.

250
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,000
That's how you do it.

251
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,386
Q is out. Get that
sandbag and start tossing.

252
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,906
All you got to do is stick that sandbag

253
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,076
at the top of that target.

254
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,596
Charlie's in the net crawl.

255
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,416
There's Ben. Venus is there.

256
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,416
Kenzie struggling to get through.

257
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,316
My god. It's so hard.

258
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,626
Liz in dead last.

259
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:54,036
18 days of fatigue showing up right now.

260
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,556
The answer to your
problem is applebee's.

261
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,060
You just got to earn it.

262
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,656
Q with the first toss. He's got a time lead.

263
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,766
Tiff is out. Start untying, tiff.

264
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,240
Q with another toss.

265
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,456
Q just misses.

266
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,620
Here goes tiff.

267
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,216
Tiff on and off with her first toss.

268
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,766
Here's Maria.

269
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,316
Got to get that sandbag out.

270
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,486
Here comes Ben.

271
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,076
Charlie's through.

272
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,216
Venus is through. Bunch
of people through at once.

273
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,486
Everybody on the sandbags
except for Kenzie and Liz,

274
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,726
taking a very long time
through the net crawl.

275
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,486
- My god.
- Keep fighting!

276
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,650
You're still in this.

277
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,726
Q is on and off.

278
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,106
Here goes Maria.

279
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,130
Maria's short.

280
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,310
Ben way short.

281
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,006
Charlie's short. Everybody's short.

282
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,976
Somebody's gonna win this, and
the whole day is gonna change.

283
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,106
Want that burger!

284
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,836
Here comes Liz.

285
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,216
- Kenzie's through.
- My god.

286
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,596
Let's go!

287
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,626
One toss is all it takes.

288
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,836
This is what you dream about

289
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,836
when you dream about survivor.

290
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,626
This moment right here.

291
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,146
Venus with the right
height, just a little short.

292
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,416
Tiff is on and off again.

293
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,486
Tiff and q have been
very close several times.

294
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,726
Who's gonna pull it out?

295
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,796
Kenzie way short.

296
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,000
Here goes Liz with her first toss.

297
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,976
Liz almost sticks one.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,416
- That was close.
- That was close, Liz.

299
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,246
Sandbags everywhere.

300
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,060
Day 18, applebee's on the line.

301
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,750
All it takes is one toss.

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,036
Tiff a little long.

303
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,580
Here goes q.

304
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,416
Q does it!

305
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,106
Q wins reward!

306
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,316
- Way to go, q.
- Applebee's.

307
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,976
- Biggest reward of the season.
- Good job, q.

308
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,796
You killed it, my guy.

309
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,906
Nothing easy out here.

310
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,930
Everybody exhausted.

311
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,006
All right, q, come on over.

312
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,580
Got some talking to do.

313
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,626
- Whoo! -All right, so, congratulations.
- Thank you.

314
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,976
You have earned a great reward,

315
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,796
biggest of the season... applebee's.

316
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,626
Gonna sweeten the deal a
little. This reward is gonna

317
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,766
take place at the sanctuary,

318
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,626
where good things happen.

319
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,106
And it's an overnight stay.

320
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,106
- My god. Wow.
- Wow.

321
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,556
You have a lot of power in the game

322
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,106
and a lot of strategic decisions to make.

323
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,596
Choose one person to join you.

324
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,106
So, Jeff,

325
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,456
in my everyday life, I always
try to make things right.

326
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,906
So, for my first choice,
I'm gonna choose tiff.

327
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,976
Tiff, come on over.

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,006
Yay.

329
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,556
What an interesting choice, given

330
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,836
the last tribal where you two were done.

331
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,286
Jeff, I'm-I'm actually surprised,

332
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,976
but I am excited because I
do feel like we need to talk

333
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,286
in, like, a setting where
it's not high pressure,

334
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,006
not a whole bunch of people around

335
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,766
and just really be able to hash things out.

336
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,316
All right, q, choose
another person to join you.

337
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,586
- I'm gonna beg.
- Before you decide

338
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,106
I'm gonna beg. Please.

339
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,556
Well, Liz is already begging.

340
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,100
Please.

341
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,556
The next choice that
I'm gonna make, Jeff,

342
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,626
it's just based off,

343
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,456
when I was out there by myself,

344
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,796
there was one person that came
and checked on me, genuinely,

345
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,796
wanted to know if I was all right.

346
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,316
So I just want to say thank you.

347
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,936
And the next choice
I'm gonna make is Maria.

348
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,410
- Thank you.
- Maria, come on over.

349
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,626
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

350
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,316
All right, q, you have one more person.

351
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,626
So it's gonna be four people
at the sanctuary for applebee's,

352
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,726
four people back at camp,
and you have one person,

353
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,246
Liz, sobbing,

354
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,146
has talked about food this entire season,

355
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,796
how she can't eat certain things,

356
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,936
therefore she's more hungry.

357
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,796
But it's also a million-dollar game

358
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,246
with only a few people left.

359
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,486
Liz... she hasn't eaten,
in almost 18 days.

360
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,006
This is something that
she could potentially eat.

361
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,316
But Kenzie was with me since day one,

362
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,726
and it's something in me is saying,

363
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,006
"bring the family back together."

364
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,976
So my decision

365
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,936
is basically going to be to bring Kenzie.

366
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,836
- My god.
- Come on over, Kenzie.

367
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,596
The yanu three is back together again

368
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,456
after declaring they
were dead at tribal council.

369
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,076
Sorry, y'all.

370
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,486
Liz, do you feel comfortable

371
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,386
talking about what you're feeling?

372
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,596
I'm pissed!

373
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,410
Y'all say you ain't gone without eating.

374
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,790
I see you eat every day!

375
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,656
Q, you almost blew up my whole game!

376
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,486
You overshadowed
everything I was trying to do!

377
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,416
And I said it's cool.

378
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,100
I didn't say nothing!

379
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,750
I don't even want to be around y'all!

380
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,130
I'm just... q

381
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,960
you blew up my whole freaking spot.

382
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,796
I didn't even know about the damn

383
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,796
- split vote last night.
- But, Liz,

384
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,480
you voted for me last night, so.

385
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,556
I made decisions based off
where my head is right now

386
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,386
in the game. I'm sorry.

387
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,286
I'm over it now.

388
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,146
Thank y'all for letting me have that.

389
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,416
I feel better.

390
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,556
I just exploded.

391
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,766
I'm sorry.

392
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,486
Back to your regularly
scheduled program.

393
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,656
Liz, you don't have to apologize
for having your emotions.

394
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,486
Obviously, missing out on rice

395
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,036
is coming into play now.

396
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,036
I haven't eaten since the merge.

397
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,976
I've had zero calories since the merge.

398
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,216
But there's hope in the game always.

399
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,656
I don't even think I screamed
that hard during my divorce.

400
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,456
All right, here's what's gonna happen.

401
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,076
Q, Kenzie, tiff, Maria,

402
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,246
you're gonna leave
here, go to the sanctuary.

403
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,626
Applebee's chef is there waiting for you.

404
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,006
Fresh, beautiful applebee's food.

405
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,286
You will spend the night,
get a good night's sleep,

406
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,316
and return to camp in the morning.

407
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,095
Head out, enjoy a
well-deserved afternoon.

408
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,726
Thanks, Jeff.

409
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,310
Thank you. Thanks, q.

410
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,286
Liz, Ben, Venus, Charlie,

411
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,550
got nothing for you. Grab
your stuff. Head back to camp.

412
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,976
I am... So... angry.

413
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,286
Q screwed me over. Not only

414
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,386
am I not going on this
reward, not only am I not eating,

415
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,626
but now I'm not feeling that
connection to my daughter

416
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,796
and our survivor ritual,

417
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,416
and I'm gonna have to go back

418
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,240
and just sit in all this disgusting feelings.

419
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,246
Look, survivor'stough.

420
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,510
Think you can do it? Let's
see. Apply to be on survivor.

421
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,620
Okay.

422
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,936
Thank you for letting
me have my moment.

423
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,976
I let it out.

424
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,286
I'm over it.

425
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,796
Thank you for letting me...

426
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,386
- Spew what I had to spew.
- Hey.

427
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,906
My god. I was, like, literally

428
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,836
screaming at this person.

429
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,796
We've all wanted to do
that to q at least once.

430
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,246
I'm so mad at q.

431
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,976
I mean, everyone's
aware that I have allergies.

432
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,486
Onsurvivor, I can't really eat much.

433
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,036
I'm allergic to coconut,
most fruits, chicken.

434
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,556
A lot of everyday foods
causes my throat to clench.

435
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,036
But I can eat any kind of beef, and

436
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,580
the burger is the exact
burger that I order.

437
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,036
It's like our thing. Like, the...

438
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,656
So, to not pick me and deny someone

439
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,246
who has barely eaten in 18 days,

440
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,796
who has this emotional
connection with this meal

441
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,370
I don't know what kind
of person does that.

442
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,766
You, of all people, should have been...

443
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,316
He's a villain, yo, straight up.

444
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,766
There's nothing else to say.

445
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,106
He's a villain, bro. Like, that's it.

446
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,106
You know, Liz has a daughter at home,

447
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,796
and when the applebee's
reward gets revealed,

448
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,906
Liz very publicly states

449
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,106
that this would make her feel at home.

450
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,936
That bourbon burger is what I get, too.

451
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,456
And on top of that,

452
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,286
the bourbon burger
is her go-to menu item.

453
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,976
My anger is satisfying
my hunger right now.

454
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,076
Yeah, my need for vengeance.

455
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,170
Like, how can you not feel for that?

456
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,656
But I think q is working from the bottom,

457
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,486
so the only option he has is
to rekindle his old alliances.

458
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,286
But I think they would be
idiots if they fell for this crap.

459
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,286
If I were in their position, I'd be like,

460
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,006
"yo, let me get the applebee's
and still get q out next."

461
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,936
Bula. Welcome to applebee's.

462
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,626
Bula.wow.

463
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,386
- Look at that food.
- Wow.

464
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,766
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

465
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,936
Applebee's, literally, like, is the spot.

466
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,316
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

467
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,626
- Cheers.
- Okay.

468
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,976
We get these big,
beautiful shark bowl drinks.

469
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,386
I take one sip and I'm like, "yeah.

470
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,656
Yeah. We about to
have a good time in here."

471
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,486
Hell yeah. Think amazing.

472
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,316
Giddyap.

473
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,976
- This never tasted better.
- In my entire life.

474
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,246
Me and my friends go to applebee's

475
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,596
every week just for the
spinach and artichoke dip,

476
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,976
I promise you.

477
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,796
This the appetizer, y'all.

478
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,246
I know. My god. This
is an appetizer. I forgot.

479
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,106
As soon as it entered my body,

480
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,860
I felt, like, 18 days of
starvation just evaporate.

481
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,216
I'm ready to play survivor again. Let's go.

482
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,036
Well, Liz was pissed.

483
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,416
- My god.
- Yeah.

484
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,976
- That was tough.
- Q, you might have to watch your back

485
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,456
when you get back to the camp.

486
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,146
It was tough, but, you know,

487
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,006
I've dealt with that, like firing people.

488
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,106
So I was just like, "man,
that's sad, but dang."

489
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,316
- Yeah?
- It was really hard to watch.

490
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,486
- Yeah.
- It was tough.

491
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,486
It was hard for me

492
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,006
to see Liz crying like that, but

493
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,766
at this point I think
everyone wants me out.

494
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,976
So my only option

495
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,596
is to make my bed back where I started,

496
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,146
and that's with the yanu three.

497
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,246
Man, it would make
sense for us and siga,

498
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,556
your two... Ben, Charlie and you,

499
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,216
and then the three of us, and...

500
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,796
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- We'll see what happens.

501
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,936
I mean, I really have no
strong ties to Venus or Liz,

502
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,556
so I have... I have no qualms

503
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,456
- about that whatsoever.
- Yeah. Yeah.

504
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,766
I don't either.

505
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,906
For me, this moment was about

506
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,106
pushing my game forward
with the right people.

507
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,316
Maria... she is someone
that's been in my corner,

508
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,556
and those are the
reasons I made my choices.

509
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,146
I don't owe Liz anything.

510
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,796
- Thank you, q.
- Yeah. Thank you, q.

511
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,456
I can't believe this is
happening right now.

512
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,976
I know.

513
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,656
While we're eating, I'm thinking,

514
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,596
q is like my unhealthy boyfriend.

515
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,286
He's buying me a nice
meal at applebee's,

516
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,146
hoping I just get amnesia
and forget about the fact

517
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,416
that he's left me out of
plans for half of this game.

518
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,456
Like, no, I'm smart, q.

519
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,416
Takes a little more to woo me.

520
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,216
You ready for the main course?

521
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,906
- Yes.
- Ooh. Wow.

522
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,596
- My god, it's mashed potatoes.
- I know.

523
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,766
- You're gonna have to roll me out of here.
- I know.

524
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,656
On top of that, I don't know

525
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,416
how he could pick me over Liz.

526
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,766
I was like, "damn, q, like, that's cold."

527
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,936
Like, that is cold.

528
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,036
So I'm like, "after all the
nonsense you've pulled"

529
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,626
"the past couple of days, like,
I'm just supposed to forgive you

530
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,456
because we broke bread together?"

531
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,246
Like, that's ridiculous.

532
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,796
Hope you guys are enjoying
that shrimp and chicken..

533
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,386
- It's amazing.
- OMG.

534
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,596
- Here is a burger on the house.
- Thank you so much.

535
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,006
Wow. Wow. Wow.

536
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,580
- Wow. Beautiful.
- My god.

537
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,316
Our stomachs have shrank
so much that my stomach hurt.

538
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,726
And the burger comes out.

539
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,286
This is the bourbon burger that
Liz gets every single Wednesday.

540
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,936
Thank you.

541
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,106
And I can see why.

542
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,286
Like, it's so melty, it's so moist,

543
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,836
and the mushrooms and the onions.

544
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,596
But I'm so full of all the other stuff.

545
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,100
Like, I just couldn't do it.

546
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,146
And I am mortified because
I'm one of the people

547
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,556
who are, like, taking
her burger dream away.

548
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,146
Wow. I'm about to sleep like a baby.

549
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,580
- I could sleep right now.
- Like, immediately right now.

550
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,790
Okay.

551
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,766
It's, like, really hard today.

552
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,130
I'm just in my feelings.

553
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,006
And it's not just about food.

554
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,626
I grew up really poor.

555
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,486
My family had a lot of food insecurity.

556
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,556
Pretty much, we barely ever had enough.

557
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,036
And so, being able to
sit down at applebee's

558
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,790
with my daughter is so important to me.

559
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,340
My favorite part of the week

560
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,076
is... it sounds so silly,

561
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,076
but it's picking her up after yoga.

562
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,596
We go immediately to applebee's.

563
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,556
I turn my phone off.

564
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,456
And that's the one night of the week

565
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,726
where it's just us,

566
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,486
and it's something we bond over.

567
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,626
And to have so much hope that,

568
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,976
"okay, Liz, you're gonna get
this, you're gonna get this,"

569
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,766
and then it's... It's applebee's,

570
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,510
and it's the thing I order.

571
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,146
I really wanted that connection to my kid

572
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:32,006
and that delicious, juicy burger.

573
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,456
Wow.

574
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
This'll definitely tide us over.

575
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,790
- See y'all.
- See you later. -Enjoy, q.

576
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,656
I ain't buying none of this crap.

577
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,626
Play me once, shame on you.
Play me twice, shame on me.

578
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,936
- Yeah.
- I'm not rerouting my game

579
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,766
because you're going on an apology tour.

580
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,836
Q's brought us on this reward,

581
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,836
and we're in this, like, wonderful mood.

582
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,316
And then, like, the minute

583
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,596
q steps out, tiff and Kenzie said,

584
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,440
"q's got to go. Q's got to go."

585
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,930
Right.

586
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,650
Yeah.

587
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,906
Q is still

588
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,796
a number for me. Q is somebody I trust.

589
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,626
But it sounds like

590
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,936
q has really rubbed people
the wrong way long enough, and

591
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,860
it might have to be his time to go.

592
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,246
Not a bad sunrise.

593
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,416
This is stunning.

594
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,596
Yeah.

595
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,416
How you feeling today, Liz?

596
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,976
I feel all right.

597
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,076
A little nervous if we
have a challenge today.

598
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,836
Yeah.

599
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,976
Since they're so well-fed and rested.

600
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,486
- What's up? -Hey.
- Good morning.

601
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,246
We were just wondering
when we'd see you.

602
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,146
We don't need to hear all the details,

603
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,766
but I do want to hear
a little bit about what...

604
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,246
The winners return from their feast, and

605
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,936
I'm ticked.

606
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,840
I don't want to hear
anything they have to say.

607
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,310
I had spinach and artichoke dip.

608
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,906
I'm surprised you didn't bite, like,

609
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,486
- a little bit of the burger.
- Nah, just because

610
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,316
I was so damn full, I
could barely eat any.

611
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,006
I'm listening to them,

612
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,936
and it turns out no one ate the burger.

613
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,286
I mean, honestly, it's just another,

614
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,790
like... Slap in the face.

615
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,976
Oreo milkshake, hands down.

616
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,976
That oreo milkshake was delicious.

617
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,626
I'm lactose intolerant,

618
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,726
- but I couldn't not do it.
- Okay.

619
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,726
"My god.

620
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,766
"I couldn't even eat the bacon.

621
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:07,936
I'm lactose intolerant, but I
ate the milkshake anyway."

622
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,796
I mean, shut up.

623
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,076
Like, read the freaking room.

624
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,596
I'm just, like, all over the place.

625
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,906
But as much as this not eating is making

626
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,076
my mind kind of crazy,

627
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,146
I do still have my eyes on the prize.

628
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:30,060
I'm sorry, q. I'm sorry I exploded.

629
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,960
You're allowed to express your emotions.

630
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,790
I was just really hungry.

631
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,456
So I decided to say I'm sorry

632
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,906
for my outburst at the challenge.

633
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,556
It's the biggest lie I've
ever said in this game so far

634
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,386
because, honestly, I want to vote q out.

635
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,246
I was lying. I'm not sorry.

636
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,796
I'm definitely not.

637
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,906
I'm super proud of
myself for yelling at him.

638
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,036
I will be having a hot
girl summer, though,

639
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,556
when I get home.

640
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,836
- Luckily, I...
- The survivor diet.

641
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,936
Be back to, like, my
tenth grade body weight.

642
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,316
Liz apologized for her outburst,

643
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,006
but I'm not concerned
with what Liz thinks.

644
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,076
I'm not ashamed of going
on a reward that I won.

645
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,006
I can choose who I want, and, of course,

646
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,726
there's gonna always be someone mad.

647
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,076
Hey, it's a business decision.

648
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,766
Just like at home, if I fire someone,

649
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,906
I don't care if they're kicking
and crying on the floor.

650
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,246
They have to go.

651
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,906
So, at the end of the day,

652
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,620
an apology out here, you can keep it.

653
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,036
- Okay. What's the quick update?
- All right.

654
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,976
So q proposed Venus, then Liz.

655
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,656
- Okay.
- And then

656
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,656
the ladies proposed q out first.

657
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,036
So, is the tiff blindside off?

658
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,766
For now, but

659
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,726
I think that it's all gonna come down

660
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,106
to if q wins immunity or not.

661
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,906
- Okay.
- But what were you all proposing?

662
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,106
I-I was thinking that it would be...

663
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,456
Tiff. Is that what everyone
here was talking about?

664
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,906
- No.
- Okay.

665
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,106
- Q.
- Okay.

666
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,656
That's all we were talking about.

667
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,146
After q did not take Liz on the reward,

668
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,456
everybody wants him out.

669
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,456
The only thing that scares me is that...

670
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,416
Tiff has an idol.

671
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,726
- Yeah.
- Which is why I'm like

672
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,879
I don't know how long that
can be on the back burner.

673
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:28,216
Right.

674
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,416
The problem is, tiff has an idol,

675
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,766
and it's something that, like,

676
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,456
we really have to get out of this game,

677
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,410
but everybody is just
like, "we want q gone."

678
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,726
But q is causing chaos.

679
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,556
And he proved himself
capable of winning challenges.

680
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,486
So if we have an
opportunity, he should go.

681
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,416
I think if he doesn't win, he's got to go.

682
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,836
- Yeah.
- I-I agree. Yeah.

683
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,836
I made my feelings pretty clear.

684
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,316
Everybody is saying, "beat q at all costs."

685
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,456
But for me and Maria, Tiffany
could be more of a threat.

686
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,796
So I don't want Tiffany to win either.

687
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,796
So we need to make
sure that Tiffany and q

688
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,680
lose this challenge.

689
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,100
Come on in.

690
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,680
Warriors.

691
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,310
Showing up for battle.

692
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,860
I like it.

693
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,246
All right, shall we get to
today's immunity challenge?

694
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,316
First things first, Charlie,
got to take it back.

695
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,620
Man.

696
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,556
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

697
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,286
It, like, matches his outfit so perfect.

698
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,286
It's, like, built for you.

699
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,386
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

700
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,596
For today's challenge,

701
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,246
you're gonna hold on to a handle

702
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,286
connected to a bucket containing 25%

703
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,286
of your pregame body weight.

704
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,486
Damn.

705
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,216
As your hands start to fatigue,

706
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,416
that bucket's gonna lower.

707
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,750
When it drops

708
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,416
you're out.

709
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,246
Last person left standing wins immunity,

710
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,726
- guaranteed a spot in the final seven.
- Seven.

711
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,836
Losers, tribal council, where
somebody will be the 11th person

712
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,386
voted out and become the
fourth member of our jury.

713
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,286
One more thing to deal with.

714
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,656
- Lordy.
- My god.

715
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
- I knew it.
- -Yeah.

716
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,656
The first time we did this
negotiation, it was four people

717
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,906
have to sit out or two votes
given up at tonight's tribal.

718
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,106
But there were ten of you.
There's only eight of you now.

719
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,976
It's still four people
to sit out or two votes,

720
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,790
which means the price has gone up.

721
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,556
Anybody interested in stepping out?

722
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,006
Four people gets you enough rice

723
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,936
to get you all the way
to the end of the season.

724
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,976
I mean, I'll step out.

725
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,410
Kenzie's one.

726
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,286
Liz thinking about it.

727
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,480
Y'all think you can win this?

728
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,486
All right, let's make this
a little more interesting.

729
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,386
If you can't come up with
four people for the group,

730
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,340
then any individual who wants to step out

731
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,316
your own individual portion of rice.

732
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,836
- It's not a lot...
- Aha.

733
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,340
But there's enough there
to stave off that hunger.

734
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,416
Would you guys hate me?

735
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,596
- No. No.
- Get the rice, Liz. That's yours.

736
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,146
- Girl, go ahead.
- That's all you.

737
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,216
- That's your coconut.
- All right, well, I'll step out.

738
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,596
So Liz is interested in the individual rice.

739
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,766
Well, I mean, if two other people want

740
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,766
to step out, but I know this is,

741
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,906
like, really high stakes.

742
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,906
So let's just find out.

743
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,076
Is there anybody here

744
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,246
that's even contemplating it?

745
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,310
No.

746
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,456
Q? No?

747
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,596
If I step out, I go home.

748
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,006
I'm not dropping that bucket.

749
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,626
So, if we don't make a deal today,

750
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,556
it's safe to assume we're probably

751
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,416
- not going to make a deal this season.
- Yeah.

752
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,976
- All right, Kenzie, you've stepped back.
- Yeah.

753
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,006
So you're gonna compete.

754
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,456
If the whole group was in it,

755
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,286
I was gonna go for
it, but I think I'll be able

756
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,456
to make it without the rice
because I can eat coconut.

757
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,286
So I'm not judging Liz at all.

758
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,766
I'm like, "get the rice, girl."

759
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,556
I would judge you more
if you didn't, honestly.

760
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,006
- I would be like, "just do it."
- Liz, your entire tribe

761
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,456
is saying "go for it."

762
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,596
They know you're
hungry. You have allergies.

763
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,906
You've not been eating much.

764
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,836
All right, I'm gonna take the rice.

765
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,416
- All right, Liz. - Good job, Liz.
- Crab fried rice.

766
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,836
Take a spot on the
bench. Here's your rice.

767
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
Good job, Liz.

768
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,493
My baby.

769
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:52,766
All right, everybody else, take your spots.

770
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,076
We'll get it on. Let's do it.

771
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,906
All right, Liz opted for the individual rice.

772
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,860
Everybody else is competing.

773
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,216
Here we go. Put your
hands on your handle.

774
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,316
You're gonna pull it back,
and you'll hear a click.

775
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,000
Go for it.

776
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,440
This challenge is on.

777
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,486
No way to convey how
difficult this challenge is

778
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,146
simply by looking at it.

779
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,596
Giddyap, baby. This hurts.

780
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,106
It's 25% of your weight

781
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,726
on day one, so there's a lot of variables.

782
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,626
How much weight have you lost?

783
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,680
How much strength do you still have?

784
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,580
Venus slowly dropping.

785
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,146
Venus is out, joins
Liz. We're down to six.

786
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,626
- I'm sorry, boo.
- Look how sweaty my hands are.

787
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,416
Jeff, give me a Van halen quote, please.

788
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,790
When your bucket drops, it's bottoms up.

789
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,976
Let's hope the cradle does not rock.

790
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,000
Been some crazy tribals lately.

791
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,006
You want that necklace.

792
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,316
Ben, you got this.

793
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,216
I'm doing my best.

794
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,930
Ben dropping a little but
trying to wrench it back up.

795
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,766
Kenzie getting hers back up.

796
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,620
It's going. I can't.

797
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,766
Looks like Ben is gonna
be the next one out.

798
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,036
He is. Ben is out.

799
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,386
Take a spot on the
bench. We're down to five.

800
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,316
New energy now.

801
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,656
You've been up there six minutes.

802
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,556
- Yes, Kenzie.
- My god.

803
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,650
Longest this challenge has
gone was Mike gabler, 38 minutes.

804
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,620
He went into outer space.

805
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,386
Channeling all his friends,
people he was playing for.

806
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,726
The state of Alaska?

807
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,750
Whatever it takes to
keep you in this challenge.

808
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,790
Kenzie gets her bucket back up.

809
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,580
Q fighting it off.

810
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,650
Q dropping a little more.

811
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,796
Q's lost a lot of weight out here.

812
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,766
His pregame body weight
coming into play here.

813
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,390
He's got a lot of weight in that bucket.

814
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,836
Q working hard to keep
that bucket from dropping.

815
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,796
You never know when
it's you going home.

816
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,270
He knows.

817
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,486
Q continues to, inch by
inch, get closer to being

818
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,310
out of this challenge.

819
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,626
Maria's struggling a little now.

820
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,106
No struggle, Jeff.

821
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,626
No struggle. Maria adjusting.

822
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,556
- Thank you.
- Correct.

823
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,650
All right, Maria.

824
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,130
Kenzie's bucket starting to lower now.

825
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,286
- Q drops. He's out.
- Whoo!

826
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,750
Q will not have immunity tonight.

827
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,620
And we are down to four.

828
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,556
Kenzie drops. Kenzie's out.

829
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,940
- We're down to three.
- Good job.

830
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,106
- Good job, Maria.
- Maria drops.

831
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,726
And we got a showdown.

832
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,386
- Charlie and tiff.
- Good job, girlfriend.

833
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,386
You're amazing, Maria.

834
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,456
Tiff's bucket has not moved at all, ever.

835
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,790
21 minutes you've been
up here. That is a long time.

836
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,976
Charlie adjusting his grip.

837
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,620
Trying to wrench that bucket up a little.

838
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,316
Charlie going to one hand. That is risky.

839
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,960
Yeah, I don't know if I
want to do that again.

840
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,650
That bucket drops a little,
but Charlie pulls it back up.

841
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,790
Tiff, rock solid.

842
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,796
- Tiff is locked in.
- This is gonna be a minute.

843
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,310
Tiff has not budged.

844
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,410
Tiff absolutely locked in.

845
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,270
- Charlie adjusting again.
- There you go, buddy.

846
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,906
You're locked, tiff.

847
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:53,976
Yeah. Whoo, girl.

848
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,106
Tiff quiet like a statue down on the end.

849
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,906
No need to look over.

850
00:44:58,930 --> 00:44:59,796
She's barely moved

851
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,650
or changed her body position at all.

852
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,216
If your concentration lapses

853
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,580
for even a moment,
that's all it takes to drop.

854
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,340
- That gives Charlie some hope.
- There you go, Charlie.

855
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,456
Charlie trying to get that bucket back up.

856
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,386
Get it up there, Charlie.

857
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,006
- There you go.
- Charlie pulling his bucket back up.

858
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,580
Look at that surge of energy.

859
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,076
- Wow.
- Damn.

860
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,456
- That's nuinui.
- Wow.

861
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,410
Suddenly a burst from Charlie.

862
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,860
Let's go, Charlie.

863
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,006
Tiff looks down.

864
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,200
Really?

865
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,006
- Tiff, out of nowhere, drops.
- Whoa.

866
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,906
Charlie wins his second
individual immunity.

867
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,316
Safe tonight at tribal council.

868
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,006
- Guaranteed a spot in the final seven.
- Tiff, are you okay?

869
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,766
Tiff gave everything she had

870
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,790
until her body just gave out.

871
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,240
You all right, tiff?

872
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,416
You want help up?

873
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,976
- Nah, I'm good.
- Okay.

874
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,906
- Proud of you, tiff.
- You did great.

875
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:37,836
- You did a great job.
- Wow.

876
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,486
You were amazing, tiff.

877
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,286
Good job, Charlie.

878
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,456
- That was epic.
- Good job, Charlie.

879
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,596
- Charlie, you already know.
- Good job, brother. - Good job.

880
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,246
Charlie, come on over.

881
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,006
Once again, back-to-back.

882
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,286
That was a battle.

883
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,386
You outlasted.

884
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,006
Safe tonight.

885
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,836
Guaranteed a spot in the final seven.

886
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,556
As for the rest of you,
after 19 very tough days

887
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,076
of survivor46, somebody
going home tonight.

888
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,416
11th person voted out

889
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,006
will become the fourth
member of our jury.

890
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,556
Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.

891
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,936
See you tonight at tribal. Congrats.

892
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,556
Thanks, Jeff.

893
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,656
When I started watching survivor, I saw

894
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,386
that grip strength is
the most important skill

895
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,076
for survivor challenges.

896
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,006
For the past, really, two
years, I've been literally

897
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,106
training my grip with the grip squeezers,

898
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,386
dead hangs on pull-up bars,

899
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,286
anything I can think of to
strengthen my forearms and grip.

900
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,936
It's really validating to
have your hard work pay off

901
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,680
in a way that actually impacts my game.

902
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,386
I was pretty peeved
that Charlie won immunity

903
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,836
because, aside from the
fact that I just want a chance

904
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,036
at wearing the immunity necklace,

905
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,626
I wanted to be the one to beat q

906
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,790
and send him home.

907
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,836
He tried to destroy my
game, and there's no way

908
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,286
under this Fijian sun
that I would let that go.

909
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,240
I want q gone.

910
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,286
Charlie.

911
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,246
Pulling it out.

912
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,106
Tonight is an easy vote.

913
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:35,936
Myself, Kenzie, Charlie, Ben, Maria,

914
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,106
Venus and Liz are all on
board to send him home.

915
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,976
I haven't heard a single person

916
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,976
utter another name today besides q.

917
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,486
- Liz with the rice.
- Whoo!

918
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:48,556
But when there's idols in
play, people start to act stupid.

919
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,270
I need somebody to make fire, honestly.

920
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,456
I have been doing a lot
of debating about this idol

921
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,106
because, now that it's out there,

922
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,216
I know that the clock is
ticking on when I have to play it.

923
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,656
- There it is.
- Ooh.

924
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,286
However, q kind of blew up

925
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,596
his own game and has
been causing chaos at camp.

926
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,656
He's now the biggest target.

927
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,656
He's a strong competitor.

928
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,286
He's won the individual reward,

929
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,650
and he's proven that,
like, he can beat us.

930
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,286
Can somebody throw me a coconut?

931
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,286
I think I'm gonna crack one open.

932
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,596
I'm a betting woman,

933
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,286
so I'm putting my chips on the table

934
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:19,456
and I'm making a bet.

935
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,766
Tonight I'm betting

936
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,650
I can keep my idol in my
pocket because q is going home.

937
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,246
I'd love to get the idol out.

938
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,626
Yeah, I would love to get it out, too,

939
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:37,726
but if she plays her idol
tonight, and we all vote tiff,

940
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,350
- it's gonna be really, really bad.
- Right. But let's just think.

941
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,240
Yeah. Yeah.

942
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,076
I agree.

943
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,486
It seems to be that
Kenzie is having cold feet.

944
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,726
It seems to be that Kenzie
doesn't necessarily think

945
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,936
that this is the right time
to make the Tiffany move,

946
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,146
but if I keep

947
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,060
sitting back and waiting
for the light to turn green

948
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,006
it may not turn green.

949
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,680
So I'm gonna have to run the red light.

950
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,790
You're basically in final six.

951
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,820
That's so awesome.

952
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,680
As long as y'all not trying
to blindside me tonight.

953
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,936
I have been working on
this, like, tiff blindside thing

954
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,216
on the side, but it's just not singing

955
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,836
the same heart song it was to me.

956
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,906
I have no respect for q.

957
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,416
I have no respect for the
way he's playing the game.

958
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,556
And I don't want to get out tiff,

959
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,316
who wants to be here, for
someone who doesn't care.

960
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,656
It's like spitting in the face

961
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,386
of everyone who has ever applied,

962
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,246
everyone who has
ever tried to be out here,

963
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,796
in the face of the jury,
that he just doesn't care.

964
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,820
It's annoying.

965
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,106
I don't know.

966
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,796
Probably she giving him
some type of encouragement

967
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,310
or something. I don't know.

968
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,106
I'm the easy vote.

969
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,936
But you could change that.

970
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,936
Like, there are options,

971
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,416
but, like, you got to be in the game.

972
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,510
I'm in the game.

973
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,146
If you want to take tiff out,

974
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,316
there are options to take tiff out.

975
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,750
Are you in or are you not in?

976
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:19,556
Tonight's vote is life or death, for me.

977
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,076
It's gonna be me or tiff.

978
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,246
I go to Vegas a lot, and I'm a high roller.

979
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:28,036
I hope tonight I can
roll nothing but sevens,

980
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,440
and we can send tiff home.

981
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:32,976
What are you thinking?

982
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,906
Obviously, q is an easy vote, but

983
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,510
I'd love to get the idol out.

984
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,106
We can take tiff out tonight.

985
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,486
While it may be hard to work with q,

986
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,246
I think we're gonna have to work with q.

987
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,106
I have been thinking about this vote.

988
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:51,556
Q is a schemer and a bit of a bully,

989
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,316
and I want him the hell out of here, but...

990
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,246
The argument for tiff being the vote

991
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,596
is that everybody knows tiff has an idol,

992
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,596
and the idol's more dangerous

993
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,176
than q at this point.

994
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,596
I think we got to go with the tiff blindside.

995
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,076
- Okay.
- Strategically, it's the most...

996
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,726
- It's the smartest.
- Shh.

997
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,146
Now we have four
votes to get Tiffany out,

998
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,216
but in a game where
there are eight people left,

999
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,216
that's not enough.

1000
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,656
This is how we do it.

1001
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,006
Q is down to do tiff.

1002
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,146
Okay.

1003
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,076
Maybe we don't tell Kenzie.

1004
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,486
I was thinking the same thing.

1005
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:25,106
We've got q, Ben,
me, Charlie. That's four.

1006
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,246
- Thing is, we need one more solid person.
- Personally, I think Liz

1007
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,906
is the better bet out of.

1008
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:32,006
- Liz, I don't trust her...
- But out of Liz and Venus,

1009
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,906
who do you trust more?
Venus I don't trust.

1010
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:37,146
- She'll cause some random chaos.
- Right.

1011
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,976
Venus is not somebody
I could work with,

1012
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,006
but the whole fight that Liz and q had

1013
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,556
makes it really hard
looping Liz into the plan.

1014
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,246
We only have to get one more vote.

1015
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,976
I think Liz is better.

1016
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,456
I want Tiffany out, and
I want it to be today,

1017
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,836
but Charlie's right.

1018
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:58,976
Liz is the key person for this plan, and so

1019
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,076
our plan is contingent on the person

1020
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,766
that has a personal vendetta against q.

1021
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,216
But at some point you've
got to make a move.

1022
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,556
And this is terrifying.

1023
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,216
It's terrifying because it could blow up

1024
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,656
in my face, but it could also
be a game-winning move.

1025
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,146
And I agree with that.

1026
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,656
Ben hates q.

1027
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,836
Like, a lot of us don't want q,

1028
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,076
but we have one chance.

1029
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,766
For Tiffany?

1030
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,556
This is the only night that we can do this.

1031
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,146
- Okay.
- And you are the key holder.

1032
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,936
Tonight's vote is making
the wheels turn in my head.

1033
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,386
I think Maria wants
to make this bold move

1034
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,906
for the jury, but I really, really dislike q.

1035
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:49,836
Plus I have a personal vendetta against q

1036
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,456
because he didn't pick me
for the applebee's reward.

1037
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,796
I know tiff has an idol,

1038
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,596
and that is something to consider.

1039
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,006
So it's gonna be a really hard battle

1040
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,626
between my mind and my heart.

1041
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:08,246
Getting tiff out with an idol,
without her even playing it,

1042
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:11,726
it's a huge, huge move.

1043
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,836
On the other hand, voting q out,

1044
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,036
seeing Jeff snuff his torch

1045
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,796
would be just as sweet as that juicy,

1046
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,106
delicious bourbon burger.

1047
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:28,000
Like, peace out, brother.
I am so done with you.

1048
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:00,316
- My god.
- Are you okay?

1049
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,416
Yeah.

1050
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,976
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1051
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,456
- It was on fire.
- Did you burn your hair?

1052
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,006
- Yeah. My god.
- Ooh, I smell it.

1053
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:07,626
It stinks.

1054
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,216
- It's all good? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1055
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,060
Scared me.

1056
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:19,766
Okay. Let's review where the game is.

1057
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,936
Every single person on the jury is there

1058
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,626
as a result of a massive blindside.

1059
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:30,146
Q, you have been an
unwitting smoke screen

1060
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:32,316
the last two tribals.

1061
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,486
So, once again, let's start with you.

1062
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:38,316
Did the day center
around you a lot? A little?

1063
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,726
So, Jeff, over the last three days,

1064
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,556
I've been calm.

1065
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,146
I lay on the beach. If
they approach me, good.

1066
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,906
If not, I don't bother people.

1067
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,796
Right now I have no power,
so I can only put the trust

1068
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,006
in the people around me.

1069
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,386
Tiff, this is a different story,

1070
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,146
'cause the last two tribals,

1071
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:00,006
everything was swirling around q.

1072
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,556
"Q's going home. Q's going
home. Q's going home."

1073
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,416
Nope. Still here.

1074
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,216
I mean, like q said,
he kind of just sat back,

1075
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,656
minded his business, and
he has a keen understanding

1076
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,106
that, at this point, it
really just is what it is.

1077
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,386
And today at camp,
for probably the first time

1078
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,836
in quite a while, it was actually peaceful.

1079
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,486
Kenzie, this is eerily familiar, though.

1080
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:26,286
The last two tribals,
there was this certainty

1081
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,936
that it was q going home.

1082
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,626
Did it feel different today?

1083
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:30,936
Today definitely felt different.

1084
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,796
Q has been, like, such
a good smoke screen

1085
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,006
for if a blindside is gonna get pulled off.

1086
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,596
But today we were all on a

1087
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,140
pretty much an understanding on
what was gonna go down tonight.

1088
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,726
So let's go back to the reward challenge.

1089
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,556
Biggest reward of the season.

1090
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,556
Q, you win. You're in charge.

1091
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,656
You choose Maria, tiff and Kenzie.

1092
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,286
Liz was left out, was
frustrated, understandably.

1093
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:59,416
It's a long game. She hasn't
eaten, and she let you have it.

1094
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,286
Yes.

1095
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:04,006
- That's fair.
- I mean, I said what I said.

1096
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,596
I said it very loudly and very publicly,

1097
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:10,076
but I didn't want it to be
awkward for everyone.

1098
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,656
So I apologized to q.

1099
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,976
That don't mean I'm,
like, really that sorry.

1100
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,860
But, like, q, you and I,
we just can't play together.

1101
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,416
Q, this is the story.

1102
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,076
I know, man.

1103
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,936
It's tough, Jeff, but, you
know, I put out a plan,

1104
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,316
and if four others get on
board and help me out, we'll see

1105
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,976
where things kind of shake up.

1106
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,976
But the other folks might just say,

1107
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,106
"you know what? Kick this guy out."

1108
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,216
So, you know, it's one of those things

1109
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,000
where it's not in my control.

1110
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,416
Ben, is it possible that
everybody could jump

1111
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,036
on board with q's plan,
and it's not q again tonight?

1112
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,216
Personally, I'm just a bit over it,

1113
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,286
but, if that does happen,
like, it's beyond me.

1114
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,076
'Cause everybody has
seemed to have been on, like,

1115
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,146
"q tonight? Q tonight?"

1116
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:03,976
I mean, it's almost eerie how
on board everybody is with that.

1117
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,386
Charlie, Ben said it.

1118
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:08,596
It's almost eerie.

1119
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:12,286
You can't not consider the
fact that something weird's

1120
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,006
gonna happen again,
because look across.

1121
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:18,596
The last two have been
absolute devastating blindsides

1122
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,656
using q as the smoke screen.

1123
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,906
The eerie silence is scary.

1124
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,006
And I think there was a moment today

1125
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,076
where I was sort of questioning, like,

1126
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,836
"is something going on
that I don't know about?"

1127
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:34,726
And what I realized is that, no,

1128
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,036
the calm is because people
are on the same page.

1129
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,626
So that's what I'm hanging my hat on.

1130
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,556
Maria, let's talk about blindsides

1131
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,146
at this stage of the game.

1132
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:47,456
If you're somebody
who pulls off a blindside,

1133
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,316
you're happy, you're
proud. You should be.

1134
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,836
You hoodwinked somebody.
That's difficult to do,

1135
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,106
but they're different
when you have a jury.

1136
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,766
I mean, I am sure everybody here

1137
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,316
is thinking to themselves,

1138
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,936
"how can I get something
on my résumé?"

1139
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,036
Right? Like, there are
three unfortunate people

1140
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,976
sitting over there who
are thinking to themselves,

1141
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,796
"was this a good move, or was it not?

1142
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,556
Am I gonna award a
vote to this person or not?"

1143
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,416
And so a blindside right now is huge.

1144
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,146
That's just not the case
tonight, unfortunately.

1145
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,656
Tiff, let's go back to q for a moment.

1146
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,796
There's so much energy
around whether he should be here

1147
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,976
or not that I'm curious
when the scales tip

1148
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,750
and suddenly keeping q
becomes the better move.

1149
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,726
- Liz is...
- Everybody's shaking their head.

1150
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,976
I don't know if keeping q is
the better move for anybody.

1151
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,626
Just based on what I've been hearing,

1152
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:46,216
I don't think that
anybody here thinks that q

1153
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,906
is best for their game at
this particular point in time.

1154
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:54,006
Again, for me, Jeff, I
can only put out an idea.

1155
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:57,316
If it doesn't stick with others, it doesn't

1156
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,246
make sense for their game, I
can't make 'em vote with me.

1157
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:05,036
And I was prepared to go two tribals ago.

1158
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,416
If it's my time, it's my
time. I've accepted it.

1159
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,386
If my plan is not their
plan, I'm cool, man.

1160
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,596
All right, it is time to vote.

1161
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,790
Kenzie, you're up.

1162
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,480
Very easy vote.

1163
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,650
I'll go tally the votes.

1164
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,656
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,

1165
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,620
now would be the time to do so.

1166
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,060
All right, I'll read the votes.

1167
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,790
Q.

1168
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,510
Tiff. One vote q, one vote tiff.

1169
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,680
Q. Two votes q.

1170
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,240
Q. Three votes q, one vote tiff.

1171
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,906
Tiff.

1172
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,440
That's three votes q, two votes tiff.

1173
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:14,596
Tiff. We're tied.

1174
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,240
Three votes q, three votes tiff.

1175
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:24,556
Tiff. That's four votes tiff, three votes q.

1176
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,860
One vote left.

1177
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:32,596
11th person voted out and the
fourth member of our jury: Tiff.

1178
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,740
Need to bring me your torch.

1179
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,486
Tiff, the tribe has spoken.

1180
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,580
Thank you.

1181
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,000
Time for you to go.

1182
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,060
Whoa.

1183
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,246
Grab your torches, head back to camp.

1184
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,440
Good night.

1187
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:42,036
An idol, at this point in the
game, changes everything.

1188
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:45,386
Next time on survivor... We're screwed.

1189
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:46,556
Everyone's lying.

1190
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,936
She went from being a
hero to a villain real quick.

1191
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,216
We all know what needs to be done.

1192
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,656
He's a jerk.

1193
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,386
I don't feel guilty at all.

1194
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,796
I broke my own survivor rule.

1195
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,596
I should have played my idol.

1196
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,006
I should have just gotten rid of it,

1197
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,726
but I was trying to stretch my idol out

1198
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,146
for one more tribal.

1199
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,106
It turns out that it bit me in the butt.

1200
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:13,456
So I'm not gonna sit up here
and pretend that I'm happy

1201
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,656
that I just got blindsided,

1202
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,656
but if there's any way to go out

1203
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,456
on survivor, it's a blindside.
