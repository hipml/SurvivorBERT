1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,544
Jeff: TONIGHT, GET READY TO

2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:05,255
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT 19 NEW

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,715
SCENES FROM ONE OF THE MOST

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,884
MEMORABLE SEASONS OF "SURVIVOR."

5
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,261
THIS GAME HAS BROUGHT NEW

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,973
MEANING TO LEADERSHIP, HUMILITY,

7
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,474
WINNING, AND LOSING.

8
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:22,147
THIS IS THE FIRST 27 DAYS OF

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,565
"SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC."

10
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,275
WITH SOME OF THE MOST MEMORABLE

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,485
FIRST-TIME PLAYERS IN "SURVIVOR"

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,195
HISTORY, TWO LEGENDARY FORMER

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,614
PLAYERS RETURN TO THE GAME FOR A

14
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,450
SHOT AT REDEMPTION.

15
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,118
BOTH WERE QUICK TO SET UP THEIR

16
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,161
CORE ALLIANCES.

17
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,788
I'VE GOT A SOLID ALLIANCE

18
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,623
WITH RICK, SOPHIE, BRANDON,

19
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,083
EDNA, AND ALBERT.

20
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,168
MY FIVE-PERSON ALLIANCE RIGHT

21
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,588
NOW IS MYSELF, KEITH, WHITNEY,

22
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,464
ELYSE, AND JIM.

23
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,256
Jeff: THEY LED TWO OF THE

24
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,342
MOST EVENLY MATCHED TRIBES EVER.

25
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,928
UPOLU WINS IMMUNITY!

26
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,513
SAVAII WINS IMMUNITY!

27
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,140
BUT COACH STRUGGLED TO CONTROL

28
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,600
AN UNRULY ALLY.

29
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,603
I KIND OF TOLD YOU GUYS TO

30
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,812
VOTE FOR MIKAYLA.

31
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,981
YOU SEE THE LIE, HOW THE LIE

32
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:05,273
CAME OUT.

33
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:05,815
STOP IT.

34
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,483
I'M TELLING YOU.

35
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,984
NO, I WANT YOU TO STOP IT.

36
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,445
Jeff: AND COCHRAN WAS LEFT

37
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,863
DODGING BULLETS ALL ALONG THE

38
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,155
WAY.

39
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,114
WHY?

40
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,824
PHYSICALLY HE'S GOING TO BE A

41
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,492
THREAT TO HIMSELF.

42
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,826
I HATE TO SAY IT, COCHRAN,

43
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,328
BUT YOU LOST IT FOR US.

44
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,204
Jeff: AFTER THE MERGE, BOTH

45
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,164
TRIBES WERE SIX STRONG.

46
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,373
CHEERS, EVERYBODY.

47
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,042
Jeff: AND COACH FOUND A

48
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,335
CHIRCHG IN THE ARMOR OF THE

49
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,002
FORMER SAVAII.

50
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,170
THERE'S A LINE IN THE SAND.

51
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,004
Jeff: AND AT TRIBAL

52
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,131
COUNCIL, COCHRAN DID CROSS THAT

53
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:30,840
LINE.

54
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,634
AND KEITH WAS VOTED OUT, FOLLOW

55
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,092
BY OZZY.

56
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,052
I WILL BE BACK.

57
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,387
I HOPE TO SEE ALL OF YOU COMING

58
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,680
THROUGH REDEMPTION, AND I'LL

59
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,140
SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY.

60
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,642
Jeff: OZZY WAS EXILED TO

61
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,561
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

62
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,354
LEAVING COACH IN FULL CONTROL OF

63
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:44,854
THE GAME.

64
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,815
I'M OUT HERE TO WIN.

65
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,358
I'M ON THE HERE TO GO STEP BY

66
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,027
STEP AND BE THE LAST MAN

67
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,611
STANDING.

68
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,821
Jeff: TONIGHT, WE'LL SEE

69
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,363
NEW SCENES.

70
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,323
I'M READY TO BE SEDUCED.

71
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,241
SEDUCE HER!

72
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,243
Jeff: UNCOVER-UP HIDDEN

73
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:58,910
STRATEGIES.

74
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,537
MIXING THINGS UP THIS EARLY

75
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,162
CRAZY.

76
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,205
Jeff: REVEAL PREVIOUSLY

77
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:02,872
UNTOLD STORIES.

78
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,208
I WOULD SCREW MY TRIBE OVER.

79
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,876
YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT ME AND YOU

80
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,502
TO THE END.

81
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,211
Jeff: AND GIVE NEW INSIGHT

82
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,214
INTO THE ONGOING ADVENTURE OF

83
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:16,386
"SURVIVOR."

84
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,053
Captioning brought to you by

85
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,348
Survivor Productions, CBS,

86
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,783
Jeff: IN THE EARLY DAYS OF

87
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,245
THE GAME, THE TWO TRIBES TOOK

88
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:24,537
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO CAMP

89
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,163
LIFE.

90
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,081
GET EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT

91
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,124
AND WORK ON THE SHELTER.

92
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:28,708
Reporter:

93
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,126
Jeff: THESE DIFFERENCES

94
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:30,793
DEFINED THEIR JOURNEY.

95
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,294
WE'LL PUT ONE HERE AND ONE

96
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:31,711
HERE.

97
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,296
LET'S DO IT.

98
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,088
Jeff: THROUGH THE REST OF

99
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,341
THE GAME.

100
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,050
AT STAVIE--

101
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,511
YOU GUYS WANT TO GO SWIMMING?

102
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,805
Jeff: OZZY LED A CARE-FREE

103
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,808
TRIBE WITH A LAID BACK ATTITUDE

104
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,476
BUT COCHRAN AND DAWN HAD TROUBLE

105
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,811
GETTING ON THE PARTY TRAIN.

106
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,313
MAN, THAT HURTS.

107
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,651
WE'RE ON A TROPICAL ISLAND BUT

108
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,485
WE ARE A TON MORE MODEST I THINK

109
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,112
THE WAY WE DRESS DAY TO DAY.

110
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,489
YOU GUYS COMING OR NOT?

111
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,200
NOT HAVING THE SWIM SEE THE

112
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:02,909
SUITIS A LITTLE BIT OF A DILEMMA

113
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,161
FOR ME BECAUSE I'M NOT USED TO

114
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,996
SWIMMING WITH PEOPLE I JUST MET.

115
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,497
IN THE NUDE.

116
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,207
IN MY UNDERWEAR.

117
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:09,666
I HAVE SIX KIDS.

118
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,583
COME ON, GUYS.

119
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,585
COME ON, MOM!

120
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,836
THIS IS LIKE THE EQUIVALENT

121
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,505
OF ASKING ME TO, LIKE, BE-- AM I

122
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,173
BY MYSELF HERE?

123
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,841
OH, JUST DO IT!

124
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,094
I DON'T SEE HIM GOING IN, IN

125
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:21,761
HIS UNDERWEAR.

126
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,054
NO ONE IS GIVING HIM A HARD

127
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:23,721
TIME.

128
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,764
I WAS VERY, VERY NERVOUS TO

129
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,016
STRIP DOWN TO MY UNDERWEAR AND

130
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,142
JUST WALTZ INTO THE WATER.

131
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,019
I'M NOT IN HORRIBLE PHYSICAL

132
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:30,728
CONDITION.

133
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,479
YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE WEST SHAPE

134
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,855
I'VE EVER BEEN IN.

135
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,357
AS PATHETIC AS IT IS TO SAY,

136
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,359
THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS FOR

137
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,193
ME.

138
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:37,777
OH, NO.

139
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,903
YOU WORK IN LAS VEGAS.

140
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:39,862
THIS IS NORMAL FUR.

141
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,655
WORK WITH ME!

142
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,698
RIP IT OFF N-

143
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,032
NO!

144
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:43,658
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE

145
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,535
YOUTH OF THIS GENERATION.

146
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,036
GET YOUR BUTT IN HERE!

147
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,037
COME ON!

148
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,873
THIS IS SO PAINFUL.

149
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,376
I'M FROM SALT LAKE CITY, HELLO!

150
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,213
YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY I'M NOT IN A

151
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,214
TURTLENECK.

152
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,674
Jeff: COCHRAN'S BODY ISSUES

153
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,217
WERE THE FIRST OF MANY

154
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,427
PERSONALITY QUIRKS THAT WOULD

155
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,053
KEEP HIM FROM FITTING IN.

156
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,180
THE GUYS, MYSELF EXCLUDED,

157
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,183
HAVE GONE OUT FISHING, AND THE

158
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:09,767
LADIES, MYSELF INCLUDED, HAVE

159
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,435
BEEN TENDING TO THE CAMP.

160
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,395
WE'VE GOT 10.

161
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,896
>>

162
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,355
( CHEERS )

163
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,231
MY GOD!

164
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,399
OH, IT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST

165
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,275
DAY EVER!

166
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,568
WHO WANTS TO GUT?

167
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,902
EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT THE

168
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,903
STRONGEST GUY ON THE TRIBE THERE

169
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,406
IS SOME SORT OF CAVE MAN IN ME

170
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:29,245
THAT'S JUST WAITING TO BREAK
OUT.

171
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,956
OH, COCHRAN, YOU BETTER BE

172
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,540
CAREFUL.

173
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,625
YOU'VE GOT ME SCARED.

174
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,460
TURN THE MACHETE THE OTHER WAY.

175
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,462
HE LOVES THIS.

176
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,087
HE LIVES FOR THIS.

177
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,631
I'M WATCHING AND LEARNING.

178
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,341
PLEASE, DON'T CUT YOUR HANDS.

179
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,760
TURNS OUT IN ORDER TO EAT THE

180
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,636
FISH, YOU FIRST HAVE TO TEAR

181
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,513
OPEN ITS UNDERSIDE AND PULL OUT

182
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,726
ALL THE UNDEDESIRABLE ORGANS AND

183
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,311
WHATEVER THE SLIME IS I'M

184
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:53,936
PULLING OUT OF THE FISH WHICH IS

185
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,105
OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE.

186
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,649
BACK AT HOME I'M A BIG FAN OF

187
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,192
ANIMALS.

188
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,235
I'M A ANIMAL LOVER.

189
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,446
I'M ALL ABOUT RESPECTING ANIMAL

190
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,615
AND I FEEL LIKE THE FISH RESPECT

191
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,115

192
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,866
THEY UNDERSTAND ME.

193
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,575
THEY KNOW WHEN I'M GUTTING THEM

194
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,119
I'M VERY RESPECTFUL ABOUT IT.

195
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,579
I DON'T PUT FINGERS ANYWHERE I

196
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,791
WOULD NOT WANT FINGERS PUT IN MY

197
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,500
BODY.

198
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,542
I WAS WILLING TO DO IT, ALTHOUGH

199
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,962
I HOPE TO NEVER HAVE TO DO IT

200
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:26,469
AGAIN.

201
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,805

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,473
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU.

204
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,350
Jeff: COACH WAS NOT ONLY

205
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,017
BUILDING A STRONGER FOUNDATION--

206
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,311
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY IT

207
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,771
IS TO HAVE A BUNCH OF WORKERS.

208
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,647
Jeff: HE WAS BUILDING A

209
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,356
FAMILY.

210
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,482
IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO COME OUT

211
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,109

00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:41,818
PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT CAMP LIFE,

PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT BUILDING

214
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,655
A SHELTER AND THIRD TIME AROUND,

215
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,781
COACH HAS FINALLY GOT THE

216
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,368
LEADERSHIP ROLE.

217
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:50,993

I'M GOING TO DO WHAT COACH

223
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,292

00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,168
I KNOW THAT THE SAVAII CAMP,

226
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,755
OZZY'S GREAT AT CATCHING FISH.

227
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,007
HE IS THE GREAT TYPE OF SURVIVOR

228
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,844
TO HAVE OUT HERE NEXT TO YOU.

229
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,012
AND I'LL JUST TELL YOU RIGHT

230
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,515
NOW, JUST BEING FLATONT, IF I

232
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:17,103
COACH WADE ON MY TRIBE OR OZZY?

233
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,522
I'D RATHER HAVE OZZY ON MY

234
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:19,939

235
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:20,523
GIVE ME A BREAK.

236
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,274
I'M NOT A GREAT SURVIVOR.

237
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,359
BUT THE PERCEPTION IN OUR TRIBE

238
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,153
RIGHT NOW IS WE HAVE IT GOING

239
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:25,611

00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,154
GO CRAZY ON IT.

241
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,697

243
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,869
WHEN JEFF TOLD US AS AS A GROUP

00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,203
THERE WERE GOING TO BE TWO

245
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,413
PEOPLE JOINING US I WAS HOPING

246
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,206
FOR COACH BECAUSE COACH HAS

247
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,041
PLAYED LOYAL TRICE, AND YOU GOT

248
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:39,750
TO TRUST THE GUY.

249
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,128

I CAN GET A COMMITMENT FROM

254
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,385
YOU, COACH?

255
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,887
JUST TAKE ME AS FAR AS YOU CAN.

256
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,221

PLEASE DO.

264
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,065
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT CHANGING JUST

265
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:03,608
BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING THE THIRD

266
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,233
TIME.

267
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,735
DUDE, I'M TELLING YOU THE

268
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,737

I HAVE MAD RESPECT FOR COACH.

271
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,866
WE CAN CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS

272
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,575
GAME.

273
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,577
WE CAN MAKE IT A MORE AROUNDABLE

274
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,536
GAME.

275
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,246
NOBODY WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT

276
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,582
RUSSELL HANTZ'S NEPHEW WOULD DO

277
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,791
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THAT'S

278
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,418
WHAT I WANT TO BE KNOWN AS.

279
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,254
I WANT TO BE KNOWN AS AN HONEST

280
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:25,963

I GIVE YOU MY WORD AS A MAN

287
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,266
OF GOD.

288
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,934
Jeff: RUSSELL HANTZ WAS

289
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,936
NOTORIOUS FOR SABOTAGING CAMP,

290
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,730
BUT HIS NEPHEW, BRANDON HANTZ,

291
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,107
SOUGHT REDEMPTION OF THE FAMILY

292
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,442
NAME BY BECOMING A PROVIDER.

293
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:46,776
YOU GOING FISHING?

294
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,443
YES, SIR.

295
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:50,279
WOKE UP THIS MORNING EARLY, FELT

296
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,447

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:51,864

298
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,615
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

299
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,283
YOU ALL STAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

300
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,785
I WANTED TO KIND OF BUTTER UP MY

301
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,578
TRIBE A LITTLE BIT, SEE WHAT I

302
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:06,629
COULD DO.

303
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:14,095
COULD DO.

304
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,305
BRANDON'S GOING TO BE THE NEW

305
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,973
OZZY.

306
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,641
NEVER, EVER, EVER DONE SPEAR

307
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,809
FISHING BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

308
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,352
IT'S FUN.

309
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:21,894
IT'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF THE

310
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,146
CORAL AND THE WAVES.

311
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,981
OZZY WHO?

312
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,316
AND I LIKE IT.

313
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,651
Jeff: ALTHOUGH HE TRIED TO

314
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,987
HIDE HIS TRUE IDENTITY, SOVY HAD

315
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,488
HER SUSPICIONS ABOUT HIM.

316
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,323
BRANDON IS SO GOOD AT

317
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,533
FISHING, HE SO GOOD AT

318
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,659

319
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,869
HIDING SOMETHING.

320
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,830
HE'S COVERING ALL THESE TATTOOS.

321
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,831
REALLY CREEPY.

322
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:46,377
HE COULD BE SOME, LIKE,

323
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,003
REFORMED,UN, EX-GANGSTER READY

325
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,133
SO I JUST NEED TO KEEP MY EYE ON

326
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:52,675

YOU WALK OVER.

377
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,467
THIS IS WHAT--

378
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,929
I DO THAT WITH MY HANDS, KIND

379
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:20,513
OF SLOWLY.

380
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,556
YOU WEAR A TIGHT SHIRT.

381
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,974
A TIGHT SHIRT ON TOP, MUSCLES

382
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,642
POPPING OUT.

383
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,976
THIS IS ALREADY A BAD IDEA.

384
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,937
YOU'VE GOT TO DO THIS.

385
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,147
THEN YOU WALK OVER, AND YOU SAY,

386
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,399
"HI, HOW YOU DOING?

387
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,608
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

388
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,487
I REALLY LIKE THOSE EARRINGS."

389
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,196
REVERSE IT.

390
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:37,863
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO

391
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,616
WORK AT ALL FOR ME "I REALLY

392
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,618
LIKE THOSE EARRINGS."

393
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,245
PAMMA BEAR IS A NUT GIVING ME

394
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:44,954
GIRL ADVICE.

395
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,955
I'LL TAKE IT BUT I DON'T

396
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:46,539
PARTICULARLY WANT IT.

397
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,833
LIKE MY COCONUT EARRINGS?

398
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,919
OH, YEAH, DID YOU SEE THE

399
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,130
PICKUP ADVICE THAT PAPA BEAR

400
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:54,672
GAVE ME.

401
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,256
THE WHAT?

402
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,424
HOW TO PICK UP GIRLS?

403
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,049
HOW.

404
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,801
I'LL DO-- I'LL DO THE ACT.

405
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,510
PLEASE.

406
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,637
I'LL TELL YOU IF IT WOULD WORK

407
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,346
ON ME, OKAY.

408
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,472
VERY, VERY SHORT.

409
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:03,973
YOU'RE AT THE BAR.

410
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,307
OKAY.

411
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,183
I SPOT YOU--

412
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,810
I'M AT THE COCONUT BAR.

413
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,437
I SPOT YOU ACROSS THE ROOM

414
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,480
AND I LIKE WHAT I SEE.

415
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,191
SO I START WIPING MY HANDS LIKE

416
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,986
THIS IN A VERY SEDUCTIVE WAY.

417
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,737
DO IT SLOWER.

418
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,864
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

419
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,615
YEAH.

420
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,366
I LIKED IT.

421
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,535
I'M READY TO BE SEDUCED.

422
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,663
SEDUCE HER!

423
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,791
SEE, IT DOESN'T WORK.

424
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,168
IT WILL WORK.

425
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:32,960
I SAW YOU AT THIS STORE

426
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,171
ACROSS THE STREET AND I NOTICED

427
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:35,963
THE EARRINGS YOU WERE WEARING.

428
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,174
I WAS GOING TO GET THEM FOR MY

429
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,550
SISTER OR SOMETHING, SO WHERE

430
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,677
DID YOU GET THOSE EAR?

431
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,845
AND I GUESS I PIVOT--

432
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,014
NO, YOU IDIOT.

433
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,516
THEN YOU SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

434
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,185
"WHY WHEREDID YOU GET THEM?"

435
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,186
SOFT EYE CONTACT.

436
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,644
SOFT EYE CONTACT.

437
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,313
SOFT, GOOD, GOOD.

438
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,689
I'M MELTING INTO YOU.

439
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,691
AND YOU SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

440
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,359
YOU'RE A VERY PRETTY GIRL."

441
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,694
OH, YEAH, I CAN'T DO THAT.

442
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,361
YEAH, THAT'S TOO MUCH.

443
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,071
I'M TELLING YOU, AS A GIRL.

444
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:01,989
HELP HER.

445
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,200
DON'T SAY, THAT EVER.

446
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,826
THE EARRINGS, HONESTLY, IF YOU

447
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,245
CAME UP AND TOLD ME THAT YOU

448
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,705
THOUGHT MY EARRINGS WERE GOOD I

449
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,706
WOULD THINK YOU WERE GAY.

450
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,916
Jeff: IF GETTING SHOT DOWN

451
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,419
WASN'T BAD ENOUGH, AT THE

452
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,963
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE-- GO!

453
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,716
COCHRAN AND THE REST OF SAVAII--

454
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,885
UPOLU WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD.

455
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,055
MISSED OUT ON PORK IN THEIR

456
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:26,764
BELLY.

457
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,058
IN ADDITION YOU CAN TAKE HOME

458
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,684
ALL THE MEAT YOU COLLECTED.

459
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,770
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT, BABY!

460
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,902
Jeff: COACH WAS A KIND AND

461
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,071
BENEVOLENT FATHER TO HIS FAMILY,

462
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,698
BUT NOT SO MUCH TO OUTSIDERS, AS

463
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,408
MIKAYLA QUICKLY LEARNED WHEN SHE

464
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,411
COMMITTED THE HAINOS SIN OF

465
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,037
OVERCOOPING HER MORNING COFFEE.

466
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,872
MY SYSTEM.

467
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,541
A MESS, MAN.

468
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,375
BECAUSE OF THE PORK.

469
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,585
IT WAS THE LAST GREASY ONES

470
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,294
WE MADE.

471
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,587
I WENT TO BED AND IT WAS SITTING

472
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,256
HERE AND I GOT IT UP.

473
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,799
THREW YOU UP?

474
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,259
OH, YEAH.

475
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,718
I DON'T WANT TO SEE PORK TODAY.

476
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,096
I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH IT IT.

477
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:12,309
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO NEAR IT.

478
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,102
YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?

479
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,062
JUST LET ME VENT FOR A LITTLE

480
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,772
BIT, OKAY?

481
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,607
I'M WATCHING MIKAYLA, YOU KNOW.

482
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,985
THE GIRL, YOU KNOW, HAD TWO

483
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,278
HEAPING TEA SPOONS OF SUGAR AND

484
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,445
I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN OUT

485
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,280
HERE WITH NOTHING.

486
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,072
YOU GUYS HAVE NOT BEEN OUT HERE

487
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,908
WITH NOTHING SO WHEN I SEE HER

488
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,617
WITHOUT ASKING ANYONE Q.B. PUT

489
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,787
TWO HEAPING TEA SPOONS IN HER

490
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,955
COFFEE THAT BOTHERS ME MAN.

491
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,290
I KNOW I'M CRAZY.

492
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,457
I'M VENTING SO I DON'T SAY

493
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,917
ANYTHING TO THE TRIBE.

494
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:37,793
MIKAYLA IS A PROBLEM.

495
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,336
THIS MORNING, I FIXED EIGHT CUPS

496
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,129
OF COFFEE.

497
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,465
I USED ONE TEASPOON OF CREAM AND

498
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,592
SUGAR KIND.

499
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,802
AND MIKAYLA, SHE HAD ONE COUPLE

500
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,513
OF COFFEE AND SHE PUT IN TWO

501
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,807
SCOOPS OF CREAM AND SUGGAAAR.

502
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,976
SHE'S SELFISH AND I WAS AND

503
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,935
TIRED OF WATCHING IT.

504
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,937
I'M THINKING OF TAKING SOME

505
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,481
OF THAT FAT AND PUT IT OVER

506
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,024
THIFY.

507
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,942
YOU WANT TO EAT LARD?

508
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,110
I WANT TO GET A COUPLE PIECES

509
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,655
IN MY BELLY.

510
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,323
IT SMELLS RANK.

511
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,116
KEEP THOSE FLAMES GOING, MAN.

512
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,660
I WANT TO ROAST THE FAT.

513
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:18,626
OH, MY STOMACH.

514
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:24,506
PORK FAT'S READY.

515
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,675
DID YOU EAT THAT?

516
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,177
ARE YOU GUYS REALLY EATING

517
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,844
THAT?

518
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,721
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF BILE

519
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:38,979
COMING UP INTO MY THROAT.

520
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,189
THERE YOU GO.

521
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:45,027
YOU ARE SUCH AN ASS.

522
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,904
I ATE PURE PIG FAT.

523
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,364
MAYBE THAT WAS INSENSITIVE OF

524
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,368
ME, BUT I DON'T CARE.

525
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,994
MIKAYLA IS WEAK RIGHT NOW.

526
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:54,995
SHE'S SICK.

527
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,705
BESIDES, SHE'S GOING HOME NEXT.

528
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,375
OUCH.

529
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,876
Jeff: WHILE COACH WAS

530
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,378
MAKING MIKAYLA'S STOMACH TURN,

531
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,880
COCHRAN WAS BUSY MAKING HIS OWN

532
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,215
TRIBE CRINGE.

533
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,218
GENTLE ROCKING?

534
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,054
IF YOU WANT TO PUSH, I'M NOT

535
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,724
GOING TO STOP YOU.

536
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,642
TELL ME A STORY.

537
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,227
UH, I'M TRYING TO THINK.

538
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,187
I CAN TELL YOU A KIND OF

539
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,856
DISGUSTING KINDERGARTEN STORY.

540
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,608
OH, GOOD.

541
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,317
I'M READY.

542
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,736
SO I WAS IN KINDERGARTEN, AND

543
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,404
IT WAS NAP TIME AND I KNEW

544
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,614
FIWENT TO THE BATHROOM DURING

545
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,281
NAP TIME EVERYBODY WOULD HEAR

546
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,075
EVERYTHING I'M DOING IN THE

547
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:33,409
BATHROOM.

548
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:33,992
RIGHT.

549
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,579
SO I DECIDED I'D GO IN MY

550
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,205
PANTS.

551
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,915
LIKE IN HUGGIES OR JUST

552
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:40,541
PANTS?

553
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,042
NO UNDERWEAR AND LITTLE

554
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:42,459
KHAKIS.

555
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,210
LIKE I AM NOW.

556
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,294
BASICALLY LIKE I AM NOW BUT

557
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,003
THREE FEET TALL.

558
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,172
COCHRAN'S STORIES, THEY COULD

559
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,426
MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND, I'M

560
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,135
PRETTY SURE.

561
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,095
COCHRAN TOLD THIS STORY ABOUT

562
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,097
KINDERGARTEN AND A POET

563
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,639
ACCIDENT.

564
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,724
I WAS PROBABLY CRYING OR

565
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,141
SOMETHING.

566
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:57,474
I DON'T KNOW.

567
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,559
OH, YEAH.

568
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,226
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE THE GUY.

569
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,729
WHAT A WEIRD KID.

570
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,647
THE NAP TIME ENDED, SO I GOT

571
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,314
UP WITH EVERYTHING IN MY PANTS,

572
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:08,444
AND SAT DOWN IN MY SEAT, AND

573
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,612
EVERYTHING SQUISHED ALL AROUND.

574
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,572
OH!

575
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,699
IN MY LEGS AND EVERY CREVICE

576
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,784
OF MY BODY AND I GUESS THE

577
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,911
TEACHER GOT WISE AND SHE STARTED

578
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,496
GOING AROUND THE ROOM SNIFFING

579
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,290
EACH OF OUR BUTTS.

580
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:21,999
YEAH.

581
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,459
AND SHE GOT TO MY BUTT, AND OF

582
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,168
COURSE THAT'S JACK POT.

583
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,837
YOU POOR THING!

584
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,631
NOW THAT I'M IN THIS GAME, I

585
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,759
DO LIKE TO THINK I HAVE CHANGED

586
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,676
FROM BEING THAT FIVE-YEAR-OLD

587
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,052
AND THAT THAT WAS A TEACHABLE

588
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,888
AND LEARNABLE MOMENT IN IT MY

589
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,474
LIFE THAT I CAN LOOK BACK ON

590
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,141
FONDLY.

591
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:39,808
I AM REALIZING THE FIVE-YEAR-OLD

592
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,603
HAD NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

593
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:47,149
I'M GOING TO BATHROOM IN OTHER

594
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,067
PLACES NOW.

595
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:49,485
Jeff: WHEN UPOLU WENT TO

596
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,152
TRIBAL COUNCIL--

597
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,196
HALF OF US ARE ON ONE SIDE,

598
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,405
HALF OF US ARE ON THE OTHER.

599
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,157
THAT'S NOT LOYALTY.

600
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,200
Jeff: BRANDON LAUNCHED INTO

601
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,202
AN IRRATIONAL OUTBURST.

602
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,870
VOTE ME OUT TODAY IF WE'RE

603
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,830
GOING TO PLAY DISLOYAL.

604
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,332
Jeff: BUT UNLIKE MIKAYLA,

605
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,918
HE WAS PART OF THE FAMILY, SO HE

606
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:10,839
WAS FORGIVEN BY COACH.

607
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,508
SO I WANTED TO ASK YOU, WHAT

608
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,301
DID YOU THINK ABOUT TRIBAL LAST

609
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:14,885
NIGHT?

610
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,512
WHAT DITHINK WITH TRIBAL?

611
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,054
UH-HUH.

612
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,347
I THOUGHT IT WAS UGLY.

613
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:18,847
YOU KNOW.

614
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,015
YEAH.

615
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,518
HE'S GOTTA QUIT HAVING

616
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,685
MELTDOWNS OR WE'RE GOING TO BE

617
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,394
IN TROUBLE.

618
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,021
DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

619
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:26,355
A PROBLEM ONCE WE GET TO THE

620
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:26,647
MERGE?

621
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,272
YEAH.

622
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,526
BRANDON, IF HE HAS ANOTHER

623
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,027
MELTED DOWN WE HAVE TO GET RID

624
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,821
OF HIM.

625
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,988
WE CAN'T GET TO THE MERGE AND

626
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,074
START HAVING A MELTDOWN AND

627
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,575
TELLING HIM THE GAME PLAN AND HE

628
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,326
DOES EVERY TIME.

629
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,537
BRANDON CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME.

630
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,163
THE WORLD IS VERY BLACK AND

631
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,541
WHITE TO HIM, NOT SHADES OF

632
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,875
GRAY, WHICH IN REALITY IT IS.

633
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,335
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS DESIGNED

634
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,045
FOR THIS, IN THIS PHASE OF HIS

635
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:50,754
LIFE.

636
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,547
I KNOW THAT HE'S NOT BUT HE'S

637
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,714
HONEST AND YOU CAN USE THAT.

638
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,423
BUT IT'S LIKE THE THIRD TIME.

639
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,218
HE'LL BE FINE.

640
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:56,760
I'LL KEEP HIM UNDER CONTROL.

641
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,346
BRANDON HAS HAD THREE

642
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,556
MELTDOWNS IN TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND

643
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,431
TWO TIMES IT'S JUST RANDOM.

644
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,393
THREE TIMES, THAT'S A PATTERN.

645
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,395
AFTER A MERGE, WHAT'S THE

646
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,230
LIKELIHOOD OF HIM HAVING ANOTHER

647
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,565
MELTDOWN THE FOURTH TIME?

648
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,400
I DON'T THINK HE CAN HANDLE THE

649
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,194
PRESSURE OF TRIBAL COUNCIL.

650
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,404
WHATEVER HAPPENS WE HAVE TO

651
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,572
KEEP STRATEGY TALK WITH BRENDAN

652
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,406
TO A MINIMUM.

653
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,117
HE CAN'T HANDLE A BIG, EXTENDED,

654
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,826
ANALYTICAL DEBATE.

655
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,412
LIKE WHAT WE DO WHEN WE SCENARIO

656
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,079
MAP.

657
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,581
IF THIS SCENARIO HAPPENS WE DO

658
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,248
THIS.

659
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,708
BRANDON'S ERUPTION AT TRIBAL

660
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,709
COUNCIL LAST NIGHT CONFIRMED TO

661
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,294
A LOT OF PEOPLE NAHE REALLY

662
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,378
DISTRIBUTE HAVE ANY BUSINESS IN

663
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:31,879
THIS GAME.

664
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,421
BRANDON IS HONEST.

665
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,590
BRANDON IS LOYAL.

666
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,757
TO A FAULT.

667
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,885
I MEAN, THAT'S THE THING.

668
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:38,468
BUT YOU KNOW I REALLY HAVE TO

669
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,262
HOPE THEY CAN CHANNEL THE

670
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,598
HONESTY INTO THE RIGHT

671
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,307
DIRECTION.

672
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,600
SIT DOWN JUST FOR A SECOND MAN,

673
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,602
BECAUSE I'LL JUST TELL YOU THIS,

674
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,269
RIGHT.

675
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,937
EVERYBODY FREAKING LOVES YOU,

676
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,479
MAN.

677
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,230
THEY REALLY DO, MAN.

678
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,273
THEY ARE JUST CONCERNED THAT IN

679
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,233
A MOMENT OF BLACK AND WHITE

680
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,445
HONESTY, YOU'RE GOING TO JUST

681
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,404
SAY, "HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON."

682
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,282
PRAY WITH ME, MAN.

683
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,992
EVERY DAY IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME.

684
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:02,868
I KNOW.

685
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,411
LORD, I FEEL SO STRONGLY AND I

686
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,080
HAVE SO MUCH FAITH THAT YOU'RE

687
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:07,789
SMILING DOWN ON US NOW, FATHER,

688
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,917
SO I ASK FOR A SPIRIT OF PEACE

689
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,500
FOR BRANDON.

690
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,628
GIVE HIM UNBELIEVABLE

691
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,337
SELF-CONTROL WHEN IT COMES TO

692
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,046
HIS TONGUE.

693
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,299
90% OF BRANDON IS RUSSELL IN HIS

694
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:17,883
STUBBORNNESS.

695
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,634
RUSSELL JUST WANTED TO BE

696
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,427
STUBBORN TO PLAY THE GAME

697
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,136
EVILLY.

698
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,012
BRANDON IS STUBBORN TO PLAY THE

699
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,681
GAME WITH GOOD.

700
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,474
BUT THE DEMONS INSIDE OF HIM

701
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,685
WILL HAVE TO BE WRESTLED IN

702
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,439
ORDER FOR HIM TO JUST BE AT

703
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,151
PEACE, LET ALONE SURVIVE IN

704
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,653
"SURVIVOR."

705
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,946
Jeff: COMING UP NEXT--

706
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,656
I'VE HAD THE DISTINCT

707
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,157
PLEASURE OF SLEEPING IN THE

708
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,284
LOVER'S BUNGALOW WITH KEITH AND

709
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:44,701
WHITNEY.

710
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,327
THANKS, COCHRAN.

711
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,371
IF THERE'S A DOUBLE HEADED

712
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,455
MONSTER PROWLING THE CAMP, THE

713
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,499
NAME IS KEITH AND WHITNEY.

714
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,501
WHO IS THE MOST POWERFUL MAN

715
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,043
ON EARTH?

716
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,878
HERCULES.

717
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,587
I'M HERCULES?

718
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,382
I'M FEARING COACH MAY AT SOME

719
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,091
POINT DEVOUR ME.

720
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,509
ARE YOU THE MOST POWERFUL MAN

721
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:00,884
IN THE GAME.

722
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,970
I LIKE THAT.

723
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,692
Jeff: AT SAVAII, COCHRAN

724
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,694
WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE OF AN

725
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,403
OUTSIDER.

726
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,779
ALL HE COULD DO WAS WATCH FROM

727
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,572
THE SIDELINESSES AS THE OTHERS

728
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,490
GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER.

729
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,866
WHY, THANK YOU.

730
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,575
Jeff: KEITH AND WHITNEY GOT

731
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,370
SO CLOSE THEY TREATED CAMP LIFE

732
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,872
LIKE A HONEYMOON.

733
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,833
I REALLY DO, I LIKE WHO HE IS

734
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,500
AS A PERSON BUT COUPLES CAN BE

735
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,501
DANGEROUS IN THIS GAME.

736
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,212
SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN EFFORT

737
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:42,092
NOT TO SEEM TOO CLOSE.

738
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,554
WAY TO GO, WAY TO GO.

739
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,056
OH, GOD.

740
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,766
SPREAD IT OUT.

741
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,768
SO NONE OF THEM KNOWS WE'RE

742
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,060
ALIGNED.

743
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:52,602
I AGREE.

744
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,731
KEITH AND WHITNEY'S

745
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,858
RELATIONSHIP IS KIND OF A

746
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,692
PANDORA'S BOX FOR ME.

747
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,194
ON THE ONE HAND, I REALLY,

748
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,280
REALLY LIKE BOTH OF THEM BUT

749
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,031
THEIR SUPER CLOSE RELATIONSHIP

750
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,282
IS SOMETHING I HOPE OTHER PEOPLE

751
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,742
ARE NOTICING.

752
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,078
I WONDER THE SLEEPING

753
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,413
ARRANGEMENTS STUFF, BUT I DON'T

754
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,581
THINK THAT REALLY MATTERS AND I

755
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,623
DO NOT WANT TO, LIKE, SNUGGLE UP

756
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:19,421
TO COCHRAN.

757
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,130
( LAUGHING )

758
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,715
GETTING ON YOUR NERVES A LITTLE?

759
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,091
I'VE HAD THE DISTINCT

760
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,593
PLEASURE OF SLEEPING IN THE

761
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,470
LOVER'S BUNGALOW WITH KEITH AND

762
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,597
WHITNEY FOR TWO NIGHTS.

763
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,600
IT'S AWKWARD ON SEVERAL LEVELS.

764
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,769
THEY'RE JUST WISPERING AND

765
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,604
GIGGLING THE ENTIRE NIGHT.

766
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,563
THEY COMPLETELY TAKE THE ENTIRE

767
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,482
BLANKET FOR THEMSELVES.

768
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,984
I'M FREEZING MY ASS OFF.

769
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,736
THANKS COCHRAN!

770
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,695
AND THEY COMPLAIN IF I MOVE

771
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,281
THE SLYEST INCH DURING THE

772
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:46,948
NIGHT.

773
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,993
THEY ACT LIKE I'VE CREATED A

774
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:50,702
HOOSH SIN.

775
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,620
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON

776
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,790
WITH KEITH AND WHITNEY IN THE

777
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,457
BUNGALOW.

778
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,458
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF NINE MONTHS

779
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,959
FROM NOW WE'LL DISCOVER THE

780
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,045
PRODUCT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP.

781
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,845
I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO KILL

782
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,682
HIM SOON.

783
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,811
SORRY.

784
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,479
Jeff: TO ADD INSULT TO

785
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:17,938
INJURY--

786
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,606
HERE, COCHRAN.

787
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,150
Jeff: OZZY WENT OUT OF HIS

788
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,486
WAY TO PUT COCHRAN IN

789
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,654
UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATIONS, MAKING

790
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,656
HIM THE OBJECT OF RIDICULE.

791
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,491
IS BLOOD GOING TO SPURT OUT.

792
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,201
YES.

793
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,494
HOLD IT DOWN.

794
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,703
HOLD IT CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM.

795
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,497
OH, GOD.

796
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,456
ARE YOU GOING TO WATCH.

797
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,958
YES, WATCH!

798
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,543
WATCH!

799
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,128
I WAS TASKED WITH THE PAROLE

800
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,671
OF HOLDING THE BODY OF THE

801
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,632
ROOSTER AS OZZY SWUNG THE

802
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,049
MACHETE.

803
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,676
OH, MY GOODNESS.

804
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,428
OZZY SAID, "COCHRAN, YOU'RE

805
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,471
HOLDING THE CHICKEN."

806
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,348
I MEAN, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT'S

807
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,182
LIKE AROUND CAMP.

808
00:23:54,266 --> 00:24:00,772
IT'S A LOT OF ORDERS FOR
COCHRAN.

809
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,356
APPARENTLY I WAS HOLDING IT

810
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,860
IN A WAY THAT OZZY FOUND

811
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,443
ENTERTAINING.

812
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,905
I SHOULDN'T BE LAUGHING.

813
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,614
COCHRAN.

814
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,075
YOU WERE HOLDING IT LIKE-- AND

815
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,036
IT WAS-- OH, MY GOD.

816
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,040
I SHOULD NOT BE LAUGHING.

817
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:19,708
AND I'M SORRY I'M LAUGHING BUT

818
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,544
IT IS JUST-- I CAN'T HELP BUT

819
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,046
HAVE THE IMAGE BURNED INTO MY

820
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,715
MIND OF COCHRAN STANDING THERE

821
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,549
HOLDING IT WITH HIS EYES CLOSED

822
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,759
AND HIS MOUTH OPEN.

823
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,051
MY MOUTH WAS OPEN?

824
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:30,635
YEAH.

825
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,096
OH, MY GOD.

826
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,598
THAT'S SO GROSS.

827
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,725
I FELT FOR THE ROOSTER

828
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,351
BECAUSE I COULD SEE THAT WE'RE

829
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,269
NOT THAT DIFFERENT.

830
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,729
I'M JUST HOPING I DON'T HAVE THE

831
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,231
EXACT SAME FATE HE DOES.

832
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,900
I COULDN'T BELIEVE I MISSED

833
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,525
THAT.

834
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,234
I HAVEN'T BEEN PLAYING THE

835
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,736
GAME SO FAR BUTS THIS BECAUSE

836
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,738
THIS HAS BEEN THE TEAM GAME, THE

837
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,447
TRIBE GAME.

838
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,616
I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE

839
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,783
HORRIBLE AT THE TRIBE GAME.

840
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,453
MERGE TIME IS WHEN I WILL

841
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,120
SUCCEED.

842
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,538
I WILL SLIVER IN AND OUT OF

843
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,958
EVERY ALLIANCE, CUT BONDS.

844
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,627
AND WHEN THE MERGE COMES IF I'M

845
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,836
STILL HERE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

846
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,545
IT HAPPEN.

847
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,796
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT HAPPEN.

848
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,673
Jeff: GO!

849
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,051
WITH THE MERGE JUST AROUND THE

850
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:11,343
CORNER.

851
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,510
MOVE IT!

852
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,596
Jeff: SAVAII BLEW A PIVOTAL

853
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,347
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

854
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,099
UPOLU WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD!

855
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,434
WE DID IT IT IT!

856
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,187
WE DID IT!

857
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,772
Jeff: AFTER THE LOSS--

858
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,315
I'M PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE

859
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:25,941
LINE.

860
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:26,566
Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE

861
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,150
GOING TO GO TO REDEMPTION

862
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:27,442
ISLAND.

863
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,026
YES.

864
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,444
Jeff: OZZY DREW UP A PLAN

865
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,612
SO RIDICULOUS THAT IT JUST MIGHT

866
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,279
WORK.

867
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,656
I'M GOING TO TELL CHRISTINE

868
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,783
THAT COCHRAN, THE LITTLE SMART

869
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,409
KEYSLE HE IS, FOUND THE IDOL,

870
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,118
KEPT IT FROM US.

871
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,662
WE GO TO VOTE HIM OUT, HE WHIPS

872
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,790
OUT THE IDOL, SEE YOU LATER,

873
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,499
OZZY.

874
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,417
NOT ONLY IS COCHRAN THE VILLAIN,

875
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,544
BUT HE'S NOW THE DOUBLE AGENT.

876
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,422
Jeff: OZZY'S PLAN SENT ONE

877
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,133
OF THE GREATEST COMPETITORS IN

878
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,593
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY TO REDEMPTION

879
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,135
ISLAND.

880
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,095
TO BATTLE IT OUT AGAINST

881
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:55,804
CHRISTINE, WHO WAS ON A ROLL,

882
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,848
HAVING WON FIVE DUELS IN A ROW.

883
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,977
AT THE DUEL-- OZZY HAS ALL THREE

884
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,477
KEYS.

885
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,104
CHRISTINE HAS NONE.

886
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,356
CHRISTINE FELL TO FIVE AND ONE.

887
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,857
OZZY WINS THE DUEL AND IS BACK

888
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,818
IN THIS GAME.

889
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,485
YES!

890
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,487
Jeff: AND THE FIRST PART OF

891
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,322
OZZY'S GAMBLE PAID OFF.

892
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,991
YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE HERE CAN

893
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,994
DROP THEIR BUFFS BECAUSE WE ARE

894
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,163
MERGED.

895
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,790
AND WHEN THE TWO TRIBES MERGED--

896
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,959
LOOKING GOOD.

897
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,669
Jeff: COACH WAS LESS THAN

898
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,422
IMPRESSED BY HIS RIFLE OZZY'S

899
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,089
SURVIVOR SKILLS.

900
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,550
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ABOUT

901
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,175
THE SLEEPING.

902
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,176
I.

903
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,178
I WAKE UP AND LIKE BUGS

904
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:37,804
CRAWLING ON ME.

905
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,015
THERE'S BUGS ALL ON YOU.

906
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:40,473
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

907
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,392
YEAH, USUALLY.

908
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:42,851
WE WERE ALMOST EXACTLY WHERE

909
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,561
THE MAT IS.

910
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,687
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT UNDER THE

911
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,271
STARS.

912
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,147
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

913
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,690
OZZY HAS PLAYED THIS GAME

914
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,357
BEFORE.

915
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:49,816
THESE OTHER PEOPLE, THEY DON'T

916
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,192
KNOW ANY BETTER.

917
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,027
"SURVIVOR" IS NOT SLEEPING ON

918
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,819
THE FLOOR GETTING BIT UP BY

919
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,612
MOSQUITOES AND ALLING KINDS OF

920
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,363
BUGS.

921
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,531
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A BEACH BUM

922
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,907
AND CAN SLEEP ON THE SAND

923
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,784
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT

924
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,162
YOUR WHOLE LIFE DOES NOT MEAN

925
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,913
YOU SUBJECT YOUR TRIBE TO THAT.

926
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,332
IS THIS WHERE THE COOL PEOPLE

927
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:05,623
SLEEP?

928
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,166
YEAH.

929
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:06,541
WHERE DO YOU SLEEP?

930
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,043
NOT IN HERE.

931
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,378
KEITH AND WHITNEY TYPICALLY

932
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,087
SLEEP IN HERE?

933
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,380
WHO ELSE?

934
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:12,756
SOMETIMES THERE'S A THIRD

935
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,465
PERSON.

936
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,383
I AT ONE POINT A THIRD PERSON.

937
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,844
I GUESS I TOSS AND TURN TOO

938
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:18,261
MUCH.

939
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,554
IT'S ANNOYING.

940
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,013
SO I'VE BEEN EJECTED.

941
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,848
THIS IS PATHETIC.

942
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,516
YOU HAVE A LOVEMAKING COUPLE

943
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,352
OVER THERE WITH WHITNEY AND

944
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,062
KEITH SHACKING UP IN THEIR OWN

945
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,229
LITTLE LOVE NEST?

946
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,356
WHO LIVES LIKE THAT?

947
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,191
WHO ALLOWS PEOPLE TO LIVE LIKE

948
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:31,733
THAT?

949
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,400
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

950
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,944
OZZY NO WONDER YOU NEVER WON

951
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:35,528
"SURVIVOR."

952
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,947
YOU'RE A FRIGGING IDIOT.

953
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,908
OZZY YOU CALL YOURSELF AN

954
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,743
ALL-STAR SURVIVOR AND YOU WANT

955
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,037
TOW COME HERE AND BUILD A

956
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,579
SHELTER LIKE THAT?

957
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,122
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF

958
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,625
YOURSELF.

959
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,335
Jeff: ON THE NEWLY FORMED

960
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,212
TE TUNA'S TRIBE FIRST NIGHT, THE

961
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,838
FORMER UPOLUS WERE RESTLESS.

962
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,340
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

963
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:59,594
I'D RATHER SLEEP DOWN FROM A

964
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,764
GARBAGE DUMP THAN THE FIRE.

965
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,099
( LAUGHTER )

966
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,226
THAT FIRE KILLS YOU.

967
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,436
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO

968
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:08,770
BARF.

969
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,397
IT IS.

970
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,774
WE'LL PUT A "SNOW SMOKING" SIGN

971
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,441
UP.

972
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,442
Jeff: BUT COACH LOOKED PAST

973
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,610
THE SMOKE AND SAW AN

974
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,152
OPPORTUNITY.

975
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,612
COCHRAN IS SLEEPING BY

976
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,321
HIMSELF.

977
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,906
JIM AND DAWN ARE CUDDLED UP NEXT

978
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,283
TO EACH OTHER WITH A PILLOW AND

979
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:22,992
BLANKET.

980
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:23,868
WHITNEY AND KEITH ARE COVERED UP

981
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,953
WITH A PILLOW AND A BLANKET, AND

982
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,247
OZZY IS SLEEPING BY THE FIRE.

983
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,998
I MEAN, HOW MESSED UP IS THAT?

984
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,126
SOMEBODY LIKE COCHRAN.

985
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,794
THAT BOY DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO

986
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,503
SURVIVE OUT HERE.

987
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,796
THAT IS NOT GOING TO STAND ON

988
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,298
COACH WADE'S WATCH.

989
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:37,966
THAT KIND OF STUFF PISSES ME

990
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:38,591
OFF.

991
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,427
YOU KNOW WHAT, COCHRAN?

992
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,261
COME OVER HERE.

993
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,639
I'VE GOT ROOM UNDER MY WING FOR

994
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:47,267
YOU.

995
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,768
Jeff: THE NEXT MORNING

996
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:52,480
COACH USED ALL OF HIS STAR POWER

997
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,065
TO BEDAZZLE COCHRAN TO

998
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,860
CONTEMPLATING A JUMP FROM SIXTH

999
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,986
AT SAVAII TO SIEVING AT UPOLU.

1000
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,155
GIVE ME A HUG, MAN.

1001
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,072
GIVE ME A HUG.

1002
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,490
HOW YOU FEELING, MAN?

1003
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,658
FEELING GOOD.

1004
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:04,075
HUH?

1005
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,742
FEELING GOOD.

1006
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,662
YOU READY FOR A LITTLE CHAT,

1007
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:08,246
MAN?

1008
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,498
YOU MIND BREAKING AWAY?

1009
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:10,999
NO STRATEGY IT'S MYTHOLOGY.

1010
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,793
MYTHOLOGY.

1011
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:14,669
GREEK MYTHOLOGY.

1012
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:15,336
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

1013
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,671
DO I HAVE TO KNEEL FOR THIS?

1014
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:17,839
I WILL BE THE ONE KNEELING,

1015
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,548
MAN.

1016
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,509
I IDENTIFY WITH COCHRAN FOR SO

1017
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,218
MANY LEVELS.

1018
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,554
I SEE SOMEBODY NOT BLESSED WITH

1019
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,263
THE BEST FEZEEB.

1020
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,848
I SEE SOMEBODY BLESSED WITH AN

1021
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,558
INCREDIBLE MIND.

1022
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,017
IMAGINE WHAT HIS LIFE HAS BEEN

1023
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,684
LIKE.

1024
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,895
IMAGINE WHAT HIS SELF-ESTEEM HAS

1025
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,688
BEEN LIKE.

1026
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,857
NOBODY HAS GIFTEN HIM

1027
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,691
SELF-CONFIDENCE IN HIS LIFE

1028
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:37,734
OUTSIDE HIS FAMILY.

1029
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,195
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO GIVE HIM

1030
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,821
COURAGE AND MAKE HIM FEEL VALUED

1031
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,323
AND PROSPECTS, I WILL DO.

1032
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,075
THIS IS A MIXTURE OF GREEK

1033
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,453
MYTHOLOGY, AND GREEK HISTORY.

1034
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,037
BUT YOU HAVE TO AGREE TO LIKE

1035
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,039
THESE NAMES, OKAY?

1036
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:51,456
ABSOLUTELY.

1037
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,208
NOT YOUR NAME.

1038
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,083
THAT'S-- THAT'S NOT QUESTIONED.

1039
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,710
YOU HAVE NAMES FOR DIFFERENT

1040
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:56,377
PEOPLE?

1041
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,045
YES, THAT'S THE THING AND I

1042
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:01,049
NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD USE IT--

1043
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,050
WE'LL START WITH OZZY.

1044
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:02,717
OKAY.

1045
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,552
OKAY?

1046
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,055
WITHOUT QUESTION, OZZY ISINAR

1047
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,224
SISIS, BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THE

1048
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,850
STORY, WHENINAR SISIS LOOKED

1049
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:15,688
INTO THE WATER BECAUSE HE WAS SO

1050
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,023
INFATUATED WITH HIMSELF HE

1051
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:17,398
BECAME UNAWARE OF THE WORLD

1052
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,193
AROUND HIM.

1053
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,903
WHITNEY IS EROTO, AND SHE WAS

1054
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,032
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THE NINE.

1055
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,617
THE NEXT ONE WOULD BE EDNA.

1056
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,326
I SAID SHE IS ECHO.

1057
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,119
AND ECHO, OBVIOUSLY, SPOKE SO

1058
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:30,828
MUCH--

1059
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,081
COACH CAME UP WITH IDENTITIES

1060
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:33,915
FOR EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THE

1061
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,461
TE TUNA TRIBE.

1062
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,088
AND A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT SO

1063
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:40,755
FLATTERING.

1064
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,090
FINALLY, AT LAST, YOU ARE THE

1065
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:47,387
MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE GAME.

1066
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:47,679
OKAY?

1067
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,012
OKAY.

1068
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:48,721
REALLY.

1069
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,056
WHO IS THE MOST POWERFUL GOD?

1070
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,766
WHO WAS THE STRONGEST, STRONGEST

1071
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,393
MAN ON EARTH THEY CALLED HIM?

1072
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,852
HERCULES.

1073
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,603
YEAH.

1074
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,104
I'M HERCULES.

1075
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,105
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

1076
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,775
THE RAGING BULL OF MINOS WAS

1077
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,485
STRONGER THAN HERCULES AND &

1078
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,529
WHAT HERCULES DID THAT MOST

1079
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,072
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS HE USED HIS

1080
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,407
BRAIN TO BEAT THE BULL.

1081
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,783
HE MOUNTED THE BULL AND FORCED

1082
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,410
IT TO SWIM UP THE RIVER ALL THE

1083
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,412
WAY TO THE CAPITAL, AND BY THE

1084
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,079
TIME THEY HAD GOTTEN TO THE

1085
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,582
CAPITAL, THE BULL WAS TIRED.

1086
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,124
HERCULES JUMPED OFF OF HIM AND

1087
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,208
SLEW HIM.

1088
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,252
THAT IS VERY APPROPRIATE.

1089
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,086
IT'S EXTREMELY APPROPRIATE.

1090
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,796
DAMN RIGHT IT'S APPROPRIATE.

1091
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,923
COACH IN DUBBING ME HERCULES

1092
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,675
IS QUITE LITERALLY ENTERED ME

1093
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,928
INTO THE PANTHON OF "SURVIVOR"

1094
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,596
GOD.

1095
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,305
I'VE EARNED HIS RESPECT AND

1096
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,849
TRUST AND NOW I'M WEARING THE

1097
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,978
ICONIC COACH JACKET, THE FLORAL

1098
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,645
PATTERNS.

1099
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,647
I'M SURE THERE'S SOME SORT OF

1100
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,481
DRAGON INSIGNIA SOMEWHERE ON

1101
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,191
HERE AND I FEEL LIKE THE DRAGON

1102
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,320
BLOOD THAT FLOWS THROUGH HIS

1103
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,988
VEINS IS ENTERING MY POURS AND

1104
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:47,655
MY BLOOD STREAM.

1105
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,490
I THOUGHT MY NAME SHOULD BE

1106
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,159
ZEUS BECAUSE ZEUS IS FOGERLY,

1107
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:51,868
RIGHT?

1108
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,162
HE LOOKS AFTER EVERYBODY, AND IF

1109
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,163
SOMEBODY WRONGS ONE OF HIS

1110
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,165
CHILDREN, HE IS RUTHLESS IN

1111
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:57,540
RETRIBUTION.

1112
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,166
I LIKE THAT.

1113
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,336
I'M ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN.

1114
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,338
DESPITE COACH'S CLAIMS THAT ZEUS

1115
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,299
IS A DOTING FATHER, I SEEM TO

1116
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,718
THINK ZEUS ATE HIS CHILDREN, AND

1117
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,553
IF HE VIEWS ME AS ONE OF HIS

1118
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,096
CHILDREN, AS HE KIND OF

1119
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,473
REPEATEDLY HAS, I'M FEARING THAT

1120
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,309
COACH AT SOME POINT MAY DEVOUR

1121
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:16,768
ME.

1122
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,352
ZEUS, HERCULES.

1123
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,354
Jeff: COMING UP NEXT--

1124
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,521
LET'S EAT THE CHICKEN.

1125
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,397
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO?

1126
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,692
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1127
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,693
SON OF A GUN!

1128
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,363
THERE'S A POINT IN TIME WHEN

1129
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,865
YOU SCREW UP AND YOU HAVE TO

1130
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:31,741
TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THAT ACTION.

1131
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,867
YOU STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

1132
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,743
TO COME WITH US.

1133
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,370
YOU HAVE MY WORD ME AND YOU TO

1134
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,037
THE END.

1135
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,206
DUDE, WAS I BORN YESTERDAY?

1136
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,333
OZZY WAS LYING.

1137
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,046
Jeff: EVERYONE KNOWS OZZY'S

1138
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,381
STRENGTHS ARE IN CHALLENGES AND

1139
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,383
PROVIDING, BUT FOR HIM TO FIND

1140
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,550
REDEMPTION, HE KNEW THAT HE

1141
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,552
NEEDED TO PLAY A BETTER SOCIAL

1142
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,303
GAME.

1143
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,221
ON DAY 20, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A

1144
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:57,016
GREAT MOVE IF HE HAD USED HIS

1145
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,892
TALENTS TO MAKE SOME FRIEND

1146
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:58,559
AMONG THE OLD UPOLU TRIBE.

1147
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,061
I'VE BEEN THE PROVIDER FOR MY

1148
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,563
TRIBE SINCE THE FIRST FREAKING

1149
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,857
WEEK OF THIS GAME, BUT ONCE YOU

1150
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,567
GET TO THE MERGE, BEING A

1151
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,403
PROVIDER REALLY IS A LIABILITY.

1152
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,947
I ONLY GOT THREE WE'RE MERGED

1153
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,198
TOGETHER AND THERE'S 12 OF US,

1154
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,242
AND PART OF ME WAS THINKING,UN,

1155
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,412
IT'S A SHAME THAT I'VE GOT TO

1156
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,746
SHARE ALL THIS FOOD WITH THE

1157
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,872
FORMER UPOLU MEMBERS THAT

1158
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,708
BASICALLY VOTING AGAINST US.

1159
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,292
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP MY

1160
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,045
TRIBE STRONG AND UNIFIED AS MUCH

1161
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,089
AS POSSIBLE.

1162
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,007
I DON'T KNOW, SHOULD WE JUST EAT

1163
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:30,591
THE FISH US, OR WHAT?

1164
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,552
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY LIKE

1165
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,219
THAT, DO YOU?

1166
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,596
IT ALWAYS GETS TOUGH TO FEED

1167
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,431
THE COMPETITION.

1168
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,265
I'M TOTALEE TRIBE.

1169
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,266
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BE--

1170
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,935
YEAH, YEAH.

1171
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:41,936
MEAN.

1172
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:42,603
YEAH.

1173
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,938
AND THAT FEELS MEAN FOR ME,

1174
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,064
SO I'M GOOD.

1175
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,274
I'M TOTALLY THE SAME TRIBE.

1176
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,608
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1177
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,277
HOW TO DO IT AND NOT FEEL LIKE

1178
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,236
AN ASS.

1179
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,947
YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT.

1180
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,781
I'M SORRY.

1181
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,450
IT'S SUCH A SELFISH GAME AT THE

1182
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,660
END OF THE DAY, AND I THINK I'M

1183
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,703
REALIZING TODAY THAT, YOU KNOW,

1184
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,663
MAYBE BEING A MOM OF SIX IS--

1185
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,291
I'M NOT USED TO BEING SO FOIXED

1186
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,626
ON PRESERVING MYSELF.

1187
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,754
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THE BEST THING

1188
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,505
YOU CAN DO AS A PARENT IS TAKE

1189
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,341
CARE OF EVERYBODY.

1190
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,302
THANK YOU FOR GETTING THAT.

1191
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,303
FEEDING THE COMPETITION IS

1192
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,472
KIND OF A WEIRD IDEA.

1193
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,431
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1194
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:22,310
YEAH, IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

1195
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:28,065
JUST DON'T WIN.

1196
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,153
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT RUDE.

1197
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,614
AND I DON'T LOOK AT YOU GUYS AS

1198
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,615
ENEMIES BY THE WAY.

1199
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,325
I GIVE OZZY A LOT OF CREDIT.

1200
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,327
HE IS BY FAR THE BEST PHYSICAL

1201
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,662
PLAYER HERE ON THIS ISLAND.

1202
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,371
IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD, MAN.

1203
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,332
IT'S NOT HOW YOU START, THOUGH.

1204
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,500
IT'S HOW YOU FINISH.

1205
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,794
AND IF HE IS WANTING TO DO THE

1206
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,503
WRONG THING, PLAY THE GAME FOR

1207
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,505
HIMSELF, I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY

1208
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,839
GOING TO BITE HIM IN THE BUTT.

1209
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,299
I KNOW HOW TO PLAY THAT GAME.

1210
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,842
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS, MAN.

1211
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:55,510
OF COURSE.

1212
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,512
I'LL GO WITH IT BECAUSE OZZY

1213
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,096
IS GOING HOME.

1214
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,347
Jeff: ON KAY 21, OZZY WON

1215
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,683
IMMUNITY AND WAS SAFE AT TRIBAL

1216
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,351
COUNCIL.

1217
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,352
SO HE TRIED TO USE HIS SOCIAL

1218
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,353
GAME TO PLAY COACH.

1219
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,813
LITTLE DID HE KNOW, COACH WAS

1220
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,564
PLAYING HIM, TOO.

1221
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,734
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME

1222
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,401
TONIGHT.

1223
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,444
YOU GUYS ARE LOOKING PRETTY

1224
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,196
GOOD, MAN.

1225
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,531
IT'S PRETTY MUCH NOT IN OUR

1226
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,032
FAVOR, MAN.

1227
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:23,037
YOU GUYS-- OH, MAN.

1228
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,704
WORST-CASE SCENARIO, MAN, IS

1229
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,375
THAT YOU GUYS WOULD WIN.

1230
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,042
I KNOW.

1231
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,210
I HATE IT, MAN.

1232
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,211
I HATE IT.

1233
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,045
I HATE IT.

1234
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:31,712
I HATE IT.

1235
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,214
I KNOW.

1236
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:33,881
IT'S--

1237
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,591
I WANTED TO PLAY THIS GAME SO

1238
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,384
BAD WITH YOU, MAN.

1239
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,927
YEAH, AND I MEAN, YOU STILL

1240
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,387
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME WITH

1241
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,054
US.

1242
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,264
AND I WOULD GUARANTEE YOU COMING

1243
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,224
TO THE END WITH ME.

1244
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,226
I WOULD SCREW MY TRIBE OVER.

1245
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:45,518
THIS COULD POSSIBLY SECURE THE

1246
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,227
TOP SIX.

1247
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,021
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS ON OUR SIDE.

1248
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,606
AND I HOPE COACH SEES THE

1249
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,399
WRITING ON THE WALL.

1250
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,025
I WILL BASICALLY GUARANTEE COACH

1251
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:53,734
THE FINAL TWO.

1252
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,945
NOT REALLY, BUT OF COURSE THAT'S

1253
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,238
WHAT I HAVE TO TELL HIM.

1254
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,574
YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT ME AND YOU

1255
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,408
TO THE END.

1256
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,244
AND ALL I CAN DO IS OFFER YOU

1257
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:03,911
THAT.

1258
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,413
DUDE, WAS I BORN YESTERDAY?

1259
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,080
ABSOLUTELY, OZZY.

1260
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:07,915
LET'S PLAY THIS GAME TOGETHER

1261
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,293
AND LET ME JUST VOTE OFF MY

1262
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,253
TRIBE.

1263
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,129
NICCI ONCE SAID WHEN YOU HAVE

1264
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,131
MORE ARROGANCE, YOU HAVE LESS

1265
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:15,882
WISDOM.

1266
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,008
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TALKING

1267
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:17,717
TO ME.

1268
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,426
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU HOLD ALL

1269
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,136
THE CARDS.

1270
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:20,845
I DON'T EVER WANT TO SAY COACH

1271
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,597
IS IN CONTROL BUT I REALLY THINK

1272
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,306
I'M IN CONTROL.

1273
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,682
IN THIS GAME THE WEAK WILL

1274
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,766
BECOME THE STRONG AND THE STRONG

1275
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,018
WILL BECOME THE WEAK.

1276
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:27,435
THAT'S WHAT COCHRAN WILL DO FOR

1277
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,688
THE GAME.

1278
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,315
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

1279
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,274
WHEN COCHRAN DID FLIP HE TOOK

1280
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,610
OUT ONE OF HIS OWN.

1281
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,485
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT THE

1282
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:40,323
"SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC."

1283
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,617
OZZY, ONCE AGAIN, THE TRIBE HAS

1284
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,619
SPOKEN.

1285
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,621
EVEN WITH SAVAII'S NUMBERS

1286
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,788
DWINDLING, KEEPING THE UPOLU

1287
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,916
FAMILY INTACT WAS A CONSTANT

1288
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,625
STRUGGLE.

1289
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,500
BY DAY 23, BRANDON'S ANTICS WERE

1290
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,295
LEADING TO INCREASINGLY GREATER

1291
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,338
CONCERNS THAT HE WAS BECOMING A

1292
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,005
LIABILITY.

1293
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,799
I WONDER IF THEY GOT REQUEST

1294
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,258
FISH.

1295
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,469
PROBABLY NOT.

1296
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,179
HOW TO GO, BRANDON!

1297
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,014
OZZY WAS AMAZING AT CATCHING

1298
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:05,723
FISH.

1299
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,933
YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA GIVE THE MAN

1300
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:07,642
HIS PROPS.

1301
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,644
I TRIED TO CATCH FISH OUT HERE.

1302
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,436
THIS CURRENT IS CRAZY.

1303
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,813
SOMETIMES THE CURRENT IS TOO BAD

1304
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,648
TO EVEN GO OUT.

1305
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,815
I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.

1306
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,775
THANKS FOR GOING OUT.

1307
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,360
EVERYONE HERE IS ABSOLUTELY

1308
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,110
STARVING.

1309
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,780
WE DON'T HAVE HAVE MANY OPTIONS

1310
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,656
AS FAR AS FOOD IS CONCERNED

1311
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,323
RIGHT NOW.

1312
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,492
BUT WE DO HAVE THE CHICKENS.

1313
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,453
THAT WILL MAKE US ONE LITTLE

1314
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,079
BITE.

1315
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,122
DUDE, WE'RE GOING TO EAT A

1316
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,250
PIECE OF EGG ABOUT THIS BIG.

1317
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,167
LET'SING BE REAL.

1318
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,336
WE EAT COCONUTS WITH

1319
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,337
EVERYTHING, MAN.

1320
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,964
THEN LET'S EAT THE CHICKEN.

1321
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:38,506
LET'S KILL THE CHICKEN.

1322
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,508
YEAH, I THINK WE SHOULD.

1323
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,509
I MADE MY DECISION AND I MADE

1324
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,094
IT KNOWN.

1325
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,345
LET'S KILL THE CHICKEN.

1326
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:58,693
LET'S EAT THE CHICKEN.

1327
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,736
SON OF A GUN.

1328
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,028
HEY!

1329
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:01,696
NO GOOD.

1330
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,948
HEY, GET THAT CHICK OWN THIS

1331
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:10,871
SIDE, GUYS!

1332
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,498
SMART CHICKEN.

1333
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,541
HE GRABBED BY THE FEATHERS.

1334
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,543
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GRAB BY THE

1335
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,252
FEET.

1336
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,045
IT'S A CHICKEN, YOU GRAB IT BY

1337
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:18,713
THE NECK AND SPIN IT AROUND AND

1338
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,215
KILL IT OR BITE ITS HEAD OFF.

1339
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,717
IF YOU WANT TO BE COOL, STRETCH

1340
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,218
IT OUT AND BITE IT.

1341
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,219
SON OF A GUN.

1342
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,012
THIS SUCKS.

1343
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,555
AND WITHSTANDON, WHO IS ALREADY

1344
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,390
IN A BAD MOOD, IS THE ONE WHEN

1345
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,475
LET CHICKEN GO SO HE'S GOING TO

1346
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:40,776
GO... AND DO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

1347
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,570
WE'RE NOT KILLING THAT ONE, ARE

1348
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,070
WE?

1349
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:52,413
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1350
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,581
KILLING A CHICKEN AT THIS

1351
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,915
POINT IS NOT THE SMARTEST THING

1352
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:55,750
TO DO.

1353
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,919
WE GO FROM TWO CHICKENS TO

1354
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,420
ZERO CHICKENS IN, LIKE, 20

1355
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,088
SECONDS HERE.

1356
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,590
SORRY ABOUT THAT, GUYS.

1357
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,925
HAVING ZERO CHICKENS BECAUSE

1358
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,135
ONE FLEW THE COOP AND THE OTHER

1359
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,429
IS NOW DEAD IS PREPORTEROUS.

1360
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,638
AND THERE'S A POINT IN TIME YOU

1361
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,099
SCREW UP AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE

1362
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:12,808
OWNERSHIP OF THAT ACTION.

1363
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,560
I GRABBED HIM AND HE JUST-- I

1364
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,687
SHOULD HAVE GRABBED HIM BY THE

1365
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,271
NECK.

1366
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,774
THE WHEELS ARE SLOWLY BUT

1367
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,442
SURELY STARTING TO COME OFF THE

1368
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,818
BRANDON HANTZ TRAIN.

1369
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,278
HE'S SO INTULSIVE SOMETIMES.

1370
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,447
HE'S ONLY A KID.

1371
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,157
HE'S 19 YEARS OLD.

1372
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,242
YOU HAVE TO CORAL HIM A LOT OF

1373
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,786
TIMES AND REEL HIM BACK IN BUT I

1374
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,788
DON'T KNOW IF I FEEL THAT

1375
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,790
COMFORTABLE INVESTING MY TRUST

1376
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,792
IN HIM, INVEST MY WELL-BEING IN

1377
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,334
THE GAME.

1378
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,002
I'M SORRY, BROTHER.

1379
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,546
BRANDON LOSING THE CHICKEN.

1380
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,964
MAYBE BRANDON CAN PRAY FOR IT

1381
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,133
AND IT WILL SHOW BACK UP.

1382
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,843
Jeff: BRANDON'S INSTABILITY

1383
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,470
WASN'T THE ONLY THREAT FACING

1384
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,805
COACH'S LEADERSHIP.

1385
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,348
ALBERT'S SELFISH AMBITIONS

1386
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,933
BUBBLED TO THE SURFACE WHEN HE

1387
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,184
PITCHED SOVIETO A PLOT TO BREAK

1388
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,393
UP THE FAMILY.

1389
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,813
IF WE GET BRANDON NEXT, USING

1390
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,022
WHITNEY AND DAWN WHO ARE GOING

1391
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,982
TO BE SCRAMBLING TO DO ANYTHING.

1392
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,651
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T DO THAT

1393
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,318
RIGHT NOW.

1394
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,487
HE'S AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

1395
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,154
PERSON.

1396
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,823
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD VOTE

1397
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:09,824
OUT BRANDON FIRST.

1398
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,491
THERE'S NO POINT.

1399
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,201
BRANDON COULD WIN IMMUNITY.

1400
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,619
I'M NOT TERRIFIED THAT

1401
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,537
BRANDON IS GOING TO GO ON AN

1402
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,830
IMMUNITY WIN.

1403
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,664
HE'S NOT.

1404
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,834
I THINK ALBERT THINKS HE HAS

1405
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,335
THIS GREAT STRATEGIC MIND AND I

1406
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:24,004
DON'T THINK HE'S COME UP WITH

1407
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,005
ONE GOOD PLAN YET.

1408
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,133
HIS RECENT PLAN IS GET RID OF

1409
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:27,675
BRANDON SOONER.

1410
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,844
I DON'T SEE THE IN THAT.

1411
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,886
EVERYONE IS GOING TO GO ALONG

1412
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,513
WITH GETTING OUT SAVAII.

1413
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,848
EVERYONE IS GOING TO GO ALONG

1414
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,057
WITH GETTING OUT BRANDON.

1415
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,559
THE LAST THING I WANT IS FOR

1416
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,853
THINGS TO BE SHAKEN UP.

1417
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,687
WHAT'S THE POINT IN PISSING

1418
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,480
BRANDON OFF.

1419
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,189
HE COULD COME BACK.

1420
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,691
I THINK MIXING THINGS UP THIS

1421
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,902
EARLY IS CRAZY BECAUSE PEOPLE

1422
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,529
LIKE RICK ARE GOING TO SAY WE

1423
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,280
SCREWED THINGS UP.

1424
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,739
ALBERT IS THE ONE WHO IS ALWAYS

1425
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,867
FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE.

1426
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,535
HE IS ALSO WANTING TO MAKE A BIG

1427
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,202
MOVE.

1428
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,663
YOU GO AGAINST THIFY, YOU GO

1429
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,415
AGAINST THE SIX.

1430
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,708
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO THROW YOU

1431
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,876
IN THE FIRE.

1432
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,835
WE'LL CHOP YOUR HEAD OFF.

1433
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,879
Jeff: 10 CASTS WAYS ARE

1434
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,714
LEFT AS THE END DRAWS NEAR.

1435
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,048
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR LAST

1436
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,925
DAY HERE BE FILLED WITH

1437
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:10,509
BITTERNESS.

1438
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,510
Jeff: CAN AN UNDERDOG

1439
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,388
OUTWIT THE MAIORITY.

1440
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,557
WHICH CASTAWAYS WILL MAKE IT

1441
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,266
TO THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1442
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,185
THEN I CANT TRUST COACH THEN.

1443
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:19,560
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS

1444
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,228
FOR ME?

1445
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:21,937
AFTER ALL I'VE DONE FOR YOU,

1446
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:22,563
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS FOR

1447
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,773
ME.

1448
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,609
Jeff: WHICH ALLIANCE WILL

1449
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,485
OUTLAST THE REST.

1450
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,904
I DON'T FEEL INDEBTED TO YOU.

1451
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,405
Jeff: AS THE ADVENTURE

1452
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,531
CONTINUES.

1453

1457
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,167

"SURVIVOR":

1459
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,462
EVERYBODY'S FIGHTING TO BE

1460
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,796
STANDING AT THE BITTER END.

1461
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,424
YOU MAKE ME HAPPY TO SEE YOU

1462
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:52,092
GO FATHER THAN RICK IN THIS

1463
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:52,676
GAME.

1464
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,010
ARE YOU GOING TO BE MY

1465
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:53,594
FRIEND?

1466
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,262
UNLESS YOU STAB ME IN THE

1467
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:55,721
BACK.

1468
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,639
I'M ON BOARD.

1469
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,765
WE CAN KICK HIM OFF.

1470
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,268
WITH MY LAST DYING BREATH, I

1471
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,937
WILL FIGHT TO KEEP MY YOUNG

1472
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:08,943
WARRIOR.

1473
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:09,610
Y.

1474
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,903
KEITH ALWAYS HAS THIS WAY OF

1475
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:11,904
TALKING TO ME AND EVERYTHING HE

1476
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,447
SAYS IS A SPORTS METAPHOR.

1477
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,074
YOU CAN'T REANALYZE LIKE

1478
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:15,783
THAT, COCHRAN.

1479
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,785
YOU CAN'T REQUEST TO COURT LIKE

1480
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,452
THAT.

1481
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:19,078
YOU KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS.

1482
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,746
YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR GAME

1483
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,664
FACEO, GAME MODE, SPORT MODE OR

1484
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,916
YOU'RE GOING TO FUMBLE.
