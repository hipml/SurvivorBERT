1
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,800
THEY'RE TOO DAMN CLOSE

2
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:18,768
>> OH, MY GOD.

3
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,770
>> KARISHMA, DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,605
>> I DO.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,231
NO HARD FEELINGS.

6
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,775
NO, I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,402
IT'S A GAME.

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,611
>> YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:34,117
>> TONIGHT AT TRIBAL, I HAD A
GUT INSTINCT THAT THERE WAS SOME

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,828
PLAN IN PLACE TO TAKE ME OUT.

11
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:41,124
FORTUNATELY I WAS THE PLAN "B,"
BUT I STILL GOT THREE VOTES.

12
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:47,922
WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS THAT TO
THIS TRIBE I AM EXPENDABLE.

13
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,761
SO UNLESS SOMETHING DRASTIC
CHANGES, MY LIFE IN THIS GAME IS

14
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,137
ABOUT TO GO OUT.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,476
THESE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY MADE
THE DECISION, EASY PEASY DONE.

16
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,643
>> YEAH!

17
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,106
>> KARISHMA FEELS LIKE SHE IS ON
THE OUTSIDE, AND I KNOW HOW

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:05,857
SHE'S FEELING.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,442
THAT WAS ME AFTER THE FIRST
VOTE.

20
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,987
BUT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO PICK
MYSELF BACK UP, AND NOW I FEEL

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,821
LIKE I'M CALLING THE SHOTS.

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,617
SO, YEAH, KARISHMA, SHE'S AN
EASY VOTE.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,330
HOWEVER, THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE
THAT MIGHT BE BETTER.

24
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,793
IN THIS GAME, ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF IS

25
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,710
WHEN PEOPLE ARE COUPLED
TOGETHER.

26
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,506
AN DEAN AN CHELSEA, THEY'RE TOO
DAMN CLOSE.

27
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,134
WHEN YOU'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE
SLEEPING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER,

28
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,135
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

29
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,345
WHAT YOU HAVE THERE IS A
POTENTIAL POWER COUPLE.

30
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:41,309
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO GET
SQUASHED.

31
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,228
>> HOWL DID YOU SAY YOU WERE?

32
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,064
>> 28.

33
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,315
>> 28?

34
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,191
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

35
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,234
>> 27.

36
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,318
>> 27.

37
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,569
OH, THIS IS PERFECT.

38
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,364
>> I MEAN, WE DID SLEEP TOGETHER
LAST NIGHT.

39
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,241
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN
YOU SLEEP NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

40
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,701
>> ON THE FIRST DATE.

41
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,286
>> CHELSEA, SHE'S GOT SOME SPUNK
TO HER.

42
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,705
SHE'S A CUTIE FOR SURE.

43
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,415
SHE CAN COME BACK AT YOU WITH A
QUIP.

44
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:09,212
SHE CAN HANG IN THERE WITH THE
BOYS, AND I REALLY THIS LIKE

45
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:09,921
THAT ABOUT HER.

46
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:14,425
SO, YEAH, I'M SUPER DRAWN TO
HER.

47
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:19,222
>> HE'S A CUTE BOY, BUT, NO, I'M
NOT HERE FOR NO SHOWMANCE.

48
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:25,061
THAT ALWAYS MESSES UP PEOPLE'S
GAMES.

49
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,688
>> IS DON'T WITH CHELSEA OR NOT?

50
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,523
>> ABSOLUTELY.

51
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,735
>> WELL, IF HE DOESN'T HELP YOU
IN SOME WAY, THEN...

52
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,279
>> BASED OFF OF HIS PERFORMANCE.

53
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,572
>> HE DON'T HELP.

54
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,739
>> EXACTLY.

55
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,742
IF WE REMOVE THAT CONNECTION,
EVEN BETTER.

56
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,412
DEAN AND CHELSEA ARE SNUGGLING
UP, AND THAT COULD MESS UP THE

57
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,621
GIRLS' ALLIANCE.

58
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:48,251
SO IN "SURVIVOR," YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE PLAN.

59
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,461
SO ME AND AARON, WE HAVE A LOT
IN COMMON.

60
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,214
WE BOTH WENT TO THE MILITARY
ACADEMY.

61
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,801
WE BOTH HAVE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE
IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND BEING

62
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,971
AFRICAN AMERICAN, AN WE'RE BOTH
VERY COMPETITIVE, SO WE'RE

63
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,180
WILLING TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.

64
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,267
SO MAYBE WE DO GET RID OF DEAN,
BECAUSE WITH DEAN OUT OF THE

65
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,727
WAY, IT WOULD BREAK UP THE PAIR.

66
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,812
AN CHELSEA WILL COME BECOME TO
ME AND ELIZABETH.

67
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,981
WE'LL GET THE SORORITY SISTERS
BACK TOGETHER.

68
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,609
>> I THINK KARISHMA, AS LONG AS
SHE STAYS ANOTHER DAY, SHE'LL DO

69
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,526
WHATEVER.

70
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,155
>> WE LET HER GO WHEN WE NEED TO
LET HER GO.

71
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,991
SHE'S ANNOYING AS HELL RIGHT
NOW, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

72
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:29,500
THAT'S "SURVIVOR."

73
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,293
>> WITH THE RAFT?

74
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:35,006
>> WITH THE RAFT.

75
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,342
>> WE'LL KEEP THE RAFT SHALLOW
UNTIL EVERYBODY IS READY.

76
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,052
>> YOU GOING?

77
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:39,552
>> I'M NOT.

78
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,304
I'M STAYING UP HERE.

79
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,263
>> OH.

80
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,807
>> THE SUN AT HIGH NOON DOESN'T
APPEAL TO ME.

81
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,478
>> THIS MORNING IN THE VOKAI
TRIBE, I COULD NOT SHAKE THIS

82
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,358
FEELING THAT GETS IMPLANTED INTO
YOUR BONES WHEN YOU'RE ONE OF

83
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,193
TWO PEOPLE LEFT OUT OF A VOTE.

84
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:55,568
>> SEE YOU AROUND.

85
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,863
>> HAVE FUN.

86
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,825
>> HAVING BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE
MOLLY VOTE REALLY KICK STARTED

87
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,537
ME INTO MAKING SURE I'M
PROTECTING MYSELF.

88
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,331
EVERYONE IS GOING OUT TO THE
WATER.

89
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,459
JASON WAS GOING FOR A WALK, AN
I'M LIKE, IF I DIDN'T LOOK FOR

90
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,502
THE IDOL RIGHT NOW I WOULD BE
STUPID.

91
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:20,009
THIS IS THE PERFECT SCENARIO.

92
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,511
DEALING WITH CHANGE HAS BEEN ANY
WHOLE JAM FOR THE PAST FEW

93
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,470
YEARS.

94
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,306
I WAS IN A ROUGH RELATIONSHIP.

95
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,686
I WAS NOT TREATING MYSELF WITH
GRACE, AND I WAS NOT FEELING

96
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,187
GREAT ABOUT MYSELF.

97
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,192
THE END OF THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS
REALLY TRYING FOR ME.

98
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,404
BUT THE LESSON THAT I LEARNED
FROM THAT WAS HOW TO TAKE THINGS

99
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:44,409
IN STRIDE TO MOVE REALLY SLOWLY,
TO NOT GET TOO WORKED UP ABOUT

100
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:51,040
THINGS, BE IN TUNE WITH MY
SURROUNDINGS AND BE HERE IN

101
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,208
SPACE AND TIME.

102
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,086
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE PRESENT,
WHEN YOU'RE OBSERVANT, WHEN

103
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,548
YOU'RE CONNECTED IN THE HERE AND
NOW, MOMENTS REVEAL THEMSELVES

104
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:08,891
TO YOU.

105
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,726
"CONGRATULATIONS.

106
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,853
YOU HAVE FOUND A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

107
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,732
WHEN PLAYED AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
ANY VOTES CAST AGAINST YOU WILL

108
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,941
NOT COUNT."

109
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,779
THERE IT IS IN ALL ITS GLORY.

110
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,490
THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS IMMUNITY
IDOL.

111
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,743
PRETTY, HUH?

112
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,122
IT IS REALLY AWESOME TO FIND AN
IDOL, ESPECIALLY WITH THE TRIBE

113
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,792
WHO IS STARTING TO GET LULLED
INTO A SENSE OF COMPLACENCY THAT

114
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,419
THEY'RE IN CONTROL OF ME.

115
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:44,385
WRONG.

116
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,678
>> DO I HEAR A BOAT?

117
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,430
>> BOAT'S COMING.

118
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:47,764
BOAT'S COMING.

119
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,306
>> SERIOUS?

120
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:54,937
>> THE BOAT'S COMING.

121
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,773
>> IT'S A BAG.

122
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,523
>> THANK YOU.

123
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,275
>> SHOULD WE READ IT HERE?

124
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,610
>> ALL RIGHT.

125
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,780
>> ONE OF YOU MUST COME TO THE
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

126
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,739
>> OH, MY GOSH.

127
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,075
>> IT MUST BE UNANIMOUS
DECISION.

128
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,284
>> OH, MY GOD.

129
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,288
>> DISSENSION FROM A SINGLE
MEMBER REQUIRES YOU TO DRAW FROM

130
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,206
THE BAG.

131
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,124
THE NAME CHOSEN GETS ON THE BOAT
IMMEDIATELY.

132
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,168
>> OH, MY GOD.

133
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,961
>> I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD JUST
DRAW.

134
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,254
>> JUST DRAW.

135
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,590
>> WHOEVER GOES TO THE ISLAND OF
THE IDOLS IS GOING TO KNOW WHAT

136
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:27,929
I KNOW AND CAN BLOW UP MY GAME
OR GET CLOSER, AND WE BETTER GET

137
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,138
CLOSER.

138
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,350
>> I DON'T KNOW, CHOOSING OUT OF
THE BAG SEEMS LIKE A COP-OUT.

139
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,309
>> WOW, I LIKE IT.

140
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:39,148
>> HERE'S A QUESTION: DOES
SOMEBODY WANT TO GO?

141
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,693
>> MOST "SURVIVOR" PLAYERS KNOW
THAT JUST THE ACT OF GOING, JUST

142
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,864
LIKE THE ACT OF SEARCHING FOR
THE IDOL, IS GOING TO PUT A

143
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,490
TARGET ON YOUR BACK.

144
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,283
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO.

145
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,869
I WAS LIKE, I'M NOT GOING.

146
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,329
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

147
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,707
>> MY "SURVIVOR" FAN SIDE OF MY
BRAIN IS LIKE, YOU HAVE TO GET

148
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,918
THAT IDOL, YOU GOT TO GO, DUDE.

149
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,963
AND THEN MY MOM SIDE OF THE
BRAIN IS LIKE, YOU DON'T NEED TO

150
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,049
GO, YOU'RE GOING TO BE BY
YOURSELF OUT THERE, JUST STAY,

151
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:05,716
YOU'RE SAFER WITH NUMBERS.

152
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,552
NO ONE WANTS TO GO, REALLY IN.

153
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,471
>> REALLY?

154
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,516
>> MY WHOLE GAME IS ABOUT
LOWERING MY THREAT LEVEL AND

155
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,352
MAKING OTHER PEOPLE MORE
THREATENING, SO THERE'S NO WAY

156
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:20,523
I'M GOING TO VOLUNTEER.

157
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:20,857
>> I WOULD GO.

158
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,525
>> REALLY?

159
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:28,322
>> YEAH.

160
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,701
>> WE'RE HERE THE PLAY THIS
GAME, AN I'M A RISK TAKER.

161
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,705
I QUIT MY JOB AS A P.T.A. TO
BECOME A ENTREPRENEUR, SO TO ME

162
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,665
IT WAS A IN BRAINER.

163
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,875
I WANT TO GO.

164
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,586
I'M GOING TO THE ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS, AND I GET TO FIGURE OUT

165
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:41,961
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

166
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:42,712
I'M EXCITED.

167
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:47,258
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN.

168
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,552
I SEE FIRST A MAN'S FACE.

169
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,305
IT'S A KIND OF HANDSOME MAN'S
FACE.

170
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,725
TO ME IT KIND OF LOOKED
FAMILIAR.

171
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,934
>> WELCOME.

172
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,228
>> HI!

173
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,563
>> HOW'S IT GOING?

174
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,065
>> I FEEL SO LOVED RIGHT NOW.

175
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:03,691
HI.

176
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,066
I'M NOURA.

177
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,859
>> I'M ROB.

178
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,779
>> OF COURSE I KNOW WHO YOU GUYS
ARE.

179
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,407
WOW, BOSTON ROB AND SANDRA.

180
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,743
I'M SUPER EXCITED TO SEE THEM
AND MEET THEM IN PERSON.

181
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,454
SANDRA IS A TWO-TIME WINNER.

182
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,622
BOSTON ROB IS A WINNER.

183
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,499
I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE ELSE
JUMPED ON THIS.

184
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,251
THESE ARE EXPERTS THAT ARE
COMING TO YOU.

185
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,252
>> HOW IS IT GOING?

186
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,086
>> IT'S GOING WELL.

187
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,130
>> HAVE YOU EATEN ANYTHING?

188
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,424
>> I'M OPENINGEN COCONUTS LIKE
CRAZY.

189
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,594
>> HAVE YOU HAD WATERMELON?

190
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,764
>> WE HAVE WATERMELON.

191
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,641
>> YES!

192
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,143
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE SO
EXCITED.

193
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,605
>> WATERMELON IS MY FAVORITE
THING.

194
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,107
THEY WELCOMED IN ME.

195
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,776
MAYBE I CAN TALK TO THEM ACT
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MY GAME AND

196
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,653
THEY CAN GIVE ME SOME ADVICE.

197
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,111
>> CHEERS.

198
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,447
>> CHEERS, GUYS.

199
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,740
OH, MY GOSH, THIS IS SO AMAZING.

200
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,117
WHY IS THIS SO SMALL.

201
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,620
I AM NOT A TYPICAL "SURVIVOR"
PLAYER.

202
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,790
I FEEL LIKE A NOVICE, AND IF
ANYONE, I NEED THESE GUYS.

203
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,627
IN THAT MOMENT, I'M LIKE, I'M IN
THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT

204
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,378
TIME.

205
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,629
>> LET ME FELL YOU IN A LITTLE
BIT.

206
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,797
>> OKAY.

207
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,802
>> SO EVERYBODY THAT COMES TO
THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS GETS A

208
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,886
LESSON.

209
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,015
AND YOUR LESSON TODAY IS ABOUT
THE ART OF PERSUASION.

210
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,308
>> OH, WOW.

211
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,601
I NEED THAT.

212
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,647
>> PERSUADING PEOPLE IN THIS
GAME IS A VERY IMPORTANT SKILL

213
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,440
THAT EVERY PLAYER NEEDS TO HAVE.

214
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,735
IN ORDER TO PERSUADE SOMEONE
EFFECTIVELY, YOU HAVE TO

215
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,656
UNDERSTAND THAT PERSON'S
MOTIVATIONS.

216
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,158
IF YOU WERE TO GIVE IMMUNITY
IDOL IMMUNITY, THEN I WOULD

217
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,869
BELIEVE YOU, THAT WOULD CUE ME
THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO VOTE

218
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,954
AMANDA.

219
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,831
>> IT HAS TO LINE UP WITH
SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT.

220
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:46,294
>> YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A
PIVOTAL MOVE IF YOU WANT A JURY

221
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,461
VOTE.

222
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,965
>> IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IT
IS THAT THIS PERSON WANTS,

223
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:51,966
PERSUADING THEM SHOULD BE EASY.

224
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:56,220
>> I WANT TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY TO NATALIE.

225
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,682
>> ERIC, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

226
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:06,314
>> I THINK THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL
A LIFE LESSON.

227
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,857
>> DIFFERENT PEOPLE NEED
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERSUASION.

228
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,734
YOU COULD APPEAL TO SOMEONE'S
EGO.

229
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:13,863
>> YES, THAT HELPS.

230
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,156
>> BABY MONKY.

231
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,368
>> I'M GOING TO FLIRT WITH HIM.

232
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:19,910
GET HIM ON MY GOOD SIDE.

233
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,162
THAT'S WHAT I DO BEST.

234
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,707
>> YOU CAN TRY TO SCARE SOMEONE,
PUT FEAR INTO THEM TO GET WHAT

235
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,207
YOU WANT.

236
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,667
>> THIS IS THE IDOL.

237
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,880
I'M ASKING YOU FOR BOTH OF OUR
SAKES TO BECOME MY ALLY.

238
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,216
>> BASICALLY VOTE WITH US OR
YOU'RE GOING HOME TONIGHT.

239
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,053
>> OR FOR ME, RUMOR, YOU START A
RUMOR.

240
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,430
>> I KNOW, YOU'RE SO GOOD AT
THAT.

241
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,932
>> I HEARD COACH WAS SAYING HE
WANTED TO GET RID OF YOU.

242
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,227
>> HE'S GOING BEHIND MY BACK
SAYING STUFF LIKE THAT.

243
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,729
>> HE'S SO STUPID.

244
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,522
HE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE GOT
HIMSELF INTO.

245
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,735
>> WHAT ABOUT THIS FOR THAT,
YOU'RE OFFERING THEM SOMETHING

246
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,569
IN RETURN FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

247
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:54,570
>> THAT'S MORE ME.

248
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,781
MINE IS MORE INTELLECTUAL OF A
CONNECTION.

249
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,032
>> RIGHT.

250
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:03,037
I CAN THINK OF LIKE AN EXAMPLE
FROM WHEN I PLAYED, WHEN I ASKED

251
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,580
LEX TO SAVE AMBER.

252
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,791
I KIND OFEN TIESED HIM WITH, IF
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING, I'LL TAKE

253
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:12,880
CARE OF YOU LATER.

254
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,632
>> LEX, MOVE IT OUT.

255
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:19,387
>> IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE, BUT IN
HINDSIGHT, I ULTIMATELY DIDN'T

256
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,306
GET HIS VOTE AT THE END OF THE
DAY, SO SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT HE

257
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,811
HAD THE LAST LAUGH.

258
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,064
WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HERE, WE TOLD
YOU THERE WOULD BE AN

259
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,441
OPPORTUNITY TO TEST WHAT YOU
LEARNED.

260
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,609
>> OKAY.

261
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:37,947
>> WE HAVE SOME INSIGHT INTO
YOUR NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

262
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,948
SO LISTEN UP.

263
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,074
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

264
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,158
>> OKAY.

265
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:46,288
>> FOR YOUR NEXT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, THE TRIBE WILL BE

266
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,123
BLINDFOLDED.

267
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,291
ONE PERSON WILL BE THE CALLER.

268
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,294
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE IN
THE CHALLENGE.

269
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,298
IF YOU CAN PERSUADE YOUR TRIBE
TO LET YOU BE THE CALLER, YOU

270
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,969
WILL EARN AN ADVANTAGE THAT
ALLOWS YOU TO BLOCK THE VOTE OF

271
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,178
ANOTHER PLAYER.

272
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:06,183
IF YOU FAIL TO END UP IN THE
CALLER ROLE, YOU LOSE YOUR VOTE

273
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:06,976
FOR THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

274
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,772
>> I LOVE THIS.

275
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,441
>> YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THE
TEST?

276
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,859
>> I'M DOING IT.

277
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,695
>> THINK ABOUT IT, CHEW ON YOUR
WATERMELON.

278
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,320
>> I'M DOING IT.

279
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,114
I'M DOING IT NO MATTER WHAT.

280
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,408
I'M GOING TO PUSH TO BE THE
PERSON THAT CALLS IT OUT.

281
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,492
>> OKAY.

282
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,619
YOU THINK YOU CAN PULL IT OFF?

283
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,163
>> WHEW!

284
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,457
>> OH, MY GOD, THIS IS SO MUCH
FUN.

285
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,167
>> SHE DIDN'T GIVE IT MUCH
THOUGHT.

286
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,669
SHE JUST TOOK THE OFFER AND WENT
WITH IT.

287
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,504
THAT'S A MENTALITY THAT SHE HAS.

288
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,840
THAT WILL GET HER IN TROUBLE IN
THE GAME.

289
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,843
>> OKAY.

290
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:45,181
IN MY OPINION, NOURA IS THE LAST
PERSON YOU WOULD WANT IN THE

291
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,265
CALLING POSITION.

292
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:50,519
SHE CANNOT COHERENTLY COMMUNE
KATE ANYTHING TO ANYONE.

293
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,854
SHE'S LIVING IN NOURA WORLD.

294
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,022
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

295
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,065
YOU GOT TO BE IN "SURVIVOR"
WORLD.

296
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:55,858
>> BY, NOURA.

297
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,236
YOU GOT THIS.

298
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,239
>> SHE DEFINITELY IS PERCEPTIVE.

299
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:07,369
THE QUESTION IS, IS HER
PERCEPTION REALITY?

300
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,089
>> NOURA'S BACK.

301
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,344
>> NOURA!

302
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,055
>> HI.

303
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,223
I HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

304
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,226
WHEN I HIT THE BEACH, I ALREADY
AM GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF

305
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,896
ANXIETY, BECAUSE YOU GTD A BIG
GROUP, AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE

306
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,399
WAITING FOR THE NOURA TV SHOW TO
START AND QUICK PLAY.

307
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:42,112
SO BASICALLY I GET THERE, AND I
GET AN ADVANTAGE IN THE NEXT

308
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:46,158
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE THAT WILL
BENEFIT YOU AND YOUR TRIBE.

309
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:51,038
THEY BASICALLY GAVE US WHAT'S
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IS IN

310
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,289
DETAIL.

311
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:56,752
THERE'S ONLY ONE TWIST, IT SAYS
YOU HAVE TO UNANIMOUSLY AGREE ON

312
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,422
THE ROLE THAT I PLAY IN THAT
CHALLENGE.

313
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,423
>> OKAY.

314
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,925
THEN I CAN TELL YOU ALL THE
DETAILS.

315
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,220
>> THIS IS ALL A LIE, BECAUSE I
HAVE THE INFORMATION, AND I

316
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,931
COULD HAVE JUST GIVEN IT TO
THEM, BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO

317
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,101
IS SECURE THAT CALLER POSITION,
BECAUSE IF I CAN PERSUADE MY

318
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,896
TRIBE TO LET ME BE THE CALLER, I
WILL GET AN ADVANTAGE IN THIS

319
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,106
GAME.

320
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,983
IF THEY DON'T LET ME, I WILL
LOSE MY VOTE AT THE NEXT TRIBAL

321
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:19,858
COUNCIL.

322
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:26,115
>> HOW CAN WE --
>> BASICALLY SAY YES, WE

323
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,451
UNANIMOUSLY DECIDE THAT NOURA
CAN PICK THE ROLE TO DO, AND I

324
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,120
GET TO TELL YOU THE WHOLE
DETAIL.

325
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,164
YOU'LL SEE THAT'S WHY I NEED
THAT ROLE?

326
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,542
I'M DOING THE THIS FOR THAT.

327
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,295
THE IDEA IS, YOU WANT TO KNOW
THIS INFORMATION, WELL, I NEED

328
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,505
THIS COMMITMENT FROM YOU GUYS.

329
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,006
DOES EVERYONE AGREE?

330
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,424
>> EVERYONE AGREES?

331
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:43,966
EVERYONE'S FINE?

332
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:44,842
>> OKAY.

333
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,135
SO READY?

334
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,344
OKAY.

335
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,472
SO EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE BLIND
FOLD AND THERE IS A CALLER, SO

336
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,724
THAT WOULD BE ME.

337
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:59,982
SO I CALL OUT, SO NOW THERE'S A
CALLER, AND PEOPLE GO OUT AND

338
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,610
WHATEVER WE'RE RETEEFG, I HAVE
TO GUIDE EACH OF YOU TO GO OUT

339
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,820
ON THE COURSE AND BRING IT BACK.

340
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,614
WHOEVER GETS BACK FIRST WIN,
THAT'S IT.

341
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,616
>> DID YOU WANT TO BE THE
CALLER.

342
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,493
>> IT'S THE ROl
IS THE CALLING PERSON.

343
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,830
>> NOURA PRESENTS US WITH THIS
BIZARRE SCENARIO IN WHICH WE

344
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:18,042
HAVE TO CHOOSE HER ROLE IN AN
UNKNOWN GAME TO HAVE HER REVEAL

345
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:22,379
TO US WHAT THE GAME IS WE'RE
GOING THE PLAY TOMORROW FOR THE

346
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,547
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

347
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,051
IF I COULD DO FULL CIRCLES
WITHOUT BEING IN A CARTOON, OUR

348
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,552
EYES WOULD BE DOING FULL
CIRCLES.

349
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,847
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO THE TRIBE
WHY YOU THINK YOU'RE THE BEST

350
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,890
PERSON TO BE THE CALLER?

351
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,016
>> IT'S ALREADY DONE.

352
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,060
I GAVE YOU THE INFORMATION, SO I
ALREADY HAVE THAT ROLE.

353
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,186
IT CAN'T -- IT'S DONE.

354
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,815
>> WAIT, THIS IS WHAT I'M
ASKING, YOU GOT TO DECIDE WHAT

355
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,233
ROLE YOU WANTED, THAT'S THE ONLY
ROLE, THE CALLER.

356
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,485
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION.

357
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:49,031
>> WE HAD TO UNANIMOUSLY DECIDE
THAT YOU COULD PICK YOUR ROLE,

358
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,700
SO COULD YOU PICK YOUR ROLE AS A
RETRIEVER.

359
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,370
>> I GUESS I COULD, YEAH,ER
GUESS I COULD.

360
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,041
>> THIS IS NOT A GOOD LIE, BUT
IT'S GOOD NOURA IS SO IN THIS

361
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:03,212
LIE THERE IS NO WAY SHE'S GOING
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S ON ISLAND

362
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:03,796
OF THE IDOLS.

363
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,047
SO PRESSURE IS OFF OF ME.

364
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,217
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I'M THE
BEST OR NOT, IT'S THAT I COULD

365
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,011
NOT TELL YOU GUYS THIS
INFORMATION UNLESS I PICKED THE

366
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,221
ROLE.

367
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,056
IN MY MIND I DECIDED I'M GOING
TO BE THE CALLER, THAT SIMPLY,

368
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,183
BECAUSE I HAVE ALL THE
INFORMATION.

369
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,394
IT IS WHAT IT IS, WE CAN'T
CHANGE IT.

370
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,938
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT BELIEVING
IN ME.

371
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,731
THEY'RE QUESTIONING ME.

372
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,902
I DON'T THINK I'M THAT BAD OF A
CALLER.

373
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:30,197
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A BIG MOUTH,
A BIG VOICE, EVEN IF I WAS THE

374
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,076
WORST CALLER, IF WE'RE
PRACTICING AHEAD OF TIME AND WE

375
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,412
KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING INTO, I
THINK WE SHOULD BE FINE.

376
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,913
>> ALL RIGHT.

377
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,790
DAN, I'M GOING TO WALK YOU
THROUGH THE COURSE.

378
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,291
GET ON YOUR KNEES.

379
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,459
CRAWL ON YOUR KNEES.

380
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,460
OKAY.

381
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,005
AND YOU'RE GOING TO CRAWL LIKE
TEN STEPS FORWARD.

382
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,134
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR --
>> NOURA, GET BACK TO YOUR

383
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,802
PERCH.

384
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,261
DAN, STAND UP.

385
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,220
WALK TO MY VOICE.

386
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,138
TEN STEPS FORWARD.

387
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,889
>> YOU'RE GOING TO BE BEHIND ME.

388
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,766
>> I CAN'T WALK TO YOUR VOICE.

389
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,434
YOU'RE GOING TO BE BEHIND ME.

390
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,061
IS THIS FORWARD, LEFT, RIGHT?

391
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:01,562
>> OKAY.

392
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,312
I GOT IT.

393
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,898
DAN, WALK TEN STEPS FORWARD TO
ME.

394
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,110
>> NOT TO YOU.

395
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,112
>> LET ME STAND BEHIND YOU THEN.

396
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,116
>> THE BLIND MAN COULD SEE THAT
NOURA DOES NOT BELONG ON THAT

397
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:14,783
PERCH.

398
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,452
SHE DOES NOT BELONG UP THERE.

399
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,454
>> DIDN'T, TAKE FIVE STEPS
FORWARD.

400
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,748
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE,
STOP.

401
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,793
>> DON'T COUNT OUT HIS STEPS,
LET HIM DO IT AND CALL THE NEXT

402
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,461
PERSON.

403
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,795
I'M SITTING HERE DOING NOTHING.

404
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,257
>> IF NOURA IS THE CALLER AND WE
LOSE, THEN SHE'S 100 ON THE

405
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,508
CHOPPING BLOCK.

406
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,136
>> TAKE THREE STEPS FORWARD AND
KEEP GOING, NOTHING IN FRONT OF

407
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:34,803
YOU.

408
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,638
TAKE ONE STEP TO YOUR RIGHT.

409
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,515
>> OH, MY GOD.

410
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,102
>> IF SHE INSISTINGS ON BEING
THE CALLER, THEN SHE BETTER

411
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,189
FOLLOW THROUGH, BECAUSE THAT'S
GOING TO BE HER ASS.

412
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:11,006
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

413
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:14,843
VOKAI GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
THE NEW LYRSA TRIBE.

414

LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY

417
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:30,651
FIRST THINGS FIRST, GOT THE TAKE

418
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,195
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

419
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:38,033
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, A CALLER
WILL LEAD BLIND FOLDED TRIBE

420
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:41,036
MEMBERS THREW A COURSE, CHECKING
THREE KEYS ALONG THE WAY.

421
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,206
YOU'LL THEN USE THOSE KEYS TO
UNLOCK PUZZLE PIECES.

422
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:49,545
THE CALLER WILL THEN DIRECT A
STILL-BLINDFOLDED TRIBE MEMBER

423
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,880
TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE.

424
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,051
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

425
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,887
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FOURTH

426
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,557
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

427
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,058
VOKAI, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
PERSON.

428
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:04,226
YOU HAVE TO SIT SOMEBODY OUT.

429
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,062
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?

430
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,605
>> NOURA.

431
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,565
NOURA IS SITTING OUT.

432
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,568
>> YOU'RE SITTING OUT.

433
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,611
>> WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?

434
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,237
>> NOURA.

435
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,238
>> NOURA.

436
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,948
TAKE A SPOT ON THE SITOUT BENCH.

437
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,367
>> MY TRIBE TOLD ME TO SIT OUT.

438
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,247
SO AFTER ALL THAT, I LOST MY
VOTE AT THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

439
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,752
THIS MIGHT BLOW UP ANY GAME,
THIS IS A FREAKIN' MIGHT MEYER.

440
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,920
-- NIGHTMARE.

441
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:37,342
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY ELSE TAKE A
MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE AND WE'LL

442
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:37,676
GET STARTED.

443
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,510
ALL RIGHT.

444
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:49,563
IT IS ELIZABETH, THE CALLER FOR
LAIRO.

445
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,690
>> TO YOUR RIGHT, TO YOUR RIGHT.

446
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,275
ELAINE, YOU NEED TO GO TO THE
RIGHT.

447
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,359
ELAINE.

448
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,110
>> WALK STRAIGHT AND START
CLIMBING THROUGH THE WOOD.

449
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:59,448
>> SENDING EVERYBODY OUT
TOGETHER.

450
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,450
ELIZABETH GOING WITH THREE
PAIRS.

451
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,618
>> KEEP GOING.

452
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,788
>> TOM, FOLLOW ELAINE.

453
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,958
>> Jeff: IT'S ALL ABOUT
COMMUNICATION.

454
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,418
>> I'M HERE, IMHERE.

455
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,753
>> OH.

456
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,464
>> Jeff: TOMMY JUST TOOK ONE
IN THE GROIN.

457
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:20,594
IT IS ELAINE AND TOM TOGETHER,
CHELSEA AND DEAN, MISSY AND

458
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,136
KARISHMA TOGETHER.

459
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:25,140
>> YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

460
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:25,933
>> Jeff: JASON CALLING FOR
VOKAI.

461
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,976
HE SENT EVERYBODY OUT TOGETHER.

462
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,354
THAT'S GIVING THEM AN EARLY
LEAD.

463
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,190
LAUREN AND JAMAL.

464
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,943
NOW THEY HAVE TO FIND THAT KEY
AND UNCLIP IT.

465
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,736
>> ELAINE, THERE IS A ROPE.

466
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,279
PUT YOUR HAND UP.

467
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,490
OTHER HAND, PULL, PULL, PULL.

468
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,240
THERE.

469
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,660
>> Jeff: VOKAI HAS THEIR FIRST
KEY.

470
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,494
THEY'RE HEADING BACK.

471
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,372
>> TOMMY, TO YOUR LEFT, TO YOUR
LEFT.

472
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,499
STRAIGHT, TOMMY, STRAIGHT!

473
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,378
>> Jeff: TOMMY AND JACK HAVE
THE SECOND KEY FOR VOKAI.

474
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,504

476
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,343
DEAN AND CHELSEA, UNDER.

477
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,470
>> DEAN AND CHELSEA WENT OVER.

479
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,808
>> CAN WE GO BACK UNDER?

480
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,978
THEY STILL NEED TO GET TWO KEYS.

481
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,355
JANET WORKING TOGETHER, LOOKING
FOR THAT THIRD KEY.

482
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,356
>> I GOT THIS.

483
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,858
>> Jeff: THEY GOT IT.

484
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,609

JAMAL AND LAUREN HEADED BACK FOR
VOKAI.

489
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,415
LAIRO ONLY HAS ONE KEY.

490
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:36,378
THEY'RE STILL LOOKING FOR TWO
MORE.

491
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:42,217
A LOT OF PLAYERS MEETING FOR THE
FIRST TIME.

492
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,552
>> THAT'S THE OTHER TEAM, BRO.

493
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,555
>> FOLLOW MY VOICE.

494
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,891

YOU'RE GOOD!

503

>> Jeff: VOKAI IS BACK.

00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,258
THEY HAVE TO GET THOSE PUZZLE
PIECES FREE.

527
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,636
>> THE OTHER WAY, BEHIND YOU,
DEAN.

528
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,806
DEAN AND CHELSEA STILL LOOKING
FOR THAT THIRD PIECE FOR LAIRO.

529
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,475
>> DEAN, THE OTHER WAY, TURN
AROUND, DEAN.

530
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,309
WALK FORWARD.

531
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,685
>> Jeff: DEAN HAS THE PIECES

532
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,980
NOW IT'S UP TO KELLEE TO UNTIE

533
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,941

00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:21,358
THERE YOU GO.

535
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,484
>> THERE IT IS.

536
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,860
THAT'S THE THIRD KEY FOR LAIRO.

537
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,695
GOT TO UNCLIP AND YOU GOT TO
HUSTLE BACK.

538
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,657
JASON AND KELLEE NOW WORKING FOR
VOKAI.

539
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,367

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,701
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH AND LAIRO
STRUGGLING.

541
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,830
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.

542
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,041
VOKAI ALREADY WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.

543
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,669
>> SLIDE IT, SLIDE IT, THERE YOU
GO.

544
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,047
>> Jeff: DEAN AND CHELSEA
ALMOST BACK TO THE MAT.

545
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,257
YOU'RE GOOD.

546
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,008
NOW ELIZABETH HAS TO GET HER
ENTIRE TRIBE ALL THE WAY BACK TO

547
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:51,346
THE PUZZLE TABLE AS FAST AS SHE
CAN.

548
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,307
>> VOKAI WITH A HUGE LEAD.

549
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,518
THEY RALLY TAKE THEIR TIME ON
THAT PUZZLE.

550
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,647
IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING COMEBACK
IF LAIRO COULD GET BACK AND WIN

551
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,023
THIS CHALLENGE.

552
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,734
>> THAT PART ALL THE WAY OVER.

553
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,529
>> Jeff: THEY'VE BEEN VERY
CALM DURING THIS PHASE OF THE

554
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,113
CHALLENGE.

555
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,699
ANOTHER PIECE FOR VOKAI.

556
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,700
HERE COMES ELIZABETH.

557
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,244
SHE'S MADE QUICK WORK OF GETTING
HER TRIBE BACK.

558
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,204
>> YOU'RE ON THE MAT.

559
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,497
KARISHMA, GET ON THE MAT.

560
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,875
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD.

561
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,751
IT'S GOING TO BE AARON NOW
SOLVING THE PUZZLE.

562
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,752
>> OKAY.

563
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:23,670
STAND RIGHT HERE.

564
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,172
>> SLIDE TO YOUR RIGHT.

565
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,841
>> Jeff: COMEBACKS DO HAPPEN
ON "SURVIVOR."

566
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,885
THIS WOULD BE A HUGE ONE.

567
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,386
LAIRO FIGHTING TO GET BACK IN.

568
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,930
>> YOU HAVE TO LEFT IT UP AND
PUT IT IN.

569
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,600
NOW SLIDE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE
RIGHT.

570
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,893
YES, YES!

571
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,561
>> RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE
YOU ROTATE THEM.

572
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,771
>> FEEL THE NOTCH ON THE TABLE.

573
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,733
>> Jeff: IT IS VOKAI WITH A
BIG LEAD.

574
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:49,112
JASON HAS LED THIS TRIBE VERY
CALMLY FROM START TO PRESENT.

575
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:49,779
>> THIS IS NOT PERFECT.

576
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,574
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

577
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,658
>> I FEEL IT.

578
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,911
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH HAS NOT
PANICKED EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE

579
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:56,786
BEEN VERY FAR BEHIND.

580
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,621
>> OKAY.

581
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,748
>> Jeff: JASON EXAMINING HIS
PUZZLE.

582
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,375
NO, I'M NOT SURE THE OUTSIDE IS
CORRECT.

583
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,752
>> TAKE THAT PIECE IN YOUR HAND.

584
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,087
>> Jeff: LAIRO NEEDS VOKAI TO
MAKE A MISTAKE.

585
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,589
>> YES, VERY, VERY GOOD.

586
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,925
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH VERY
QUICKLY WORKING ON THIS PUZZLE.

587
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,718
>> I THINK WE GOT IT.

588
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,888
>> Jeff: AARON WITH ANOTHER
PIECE.

589
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,224
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER.

590
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,642
>> Jeff: JASON DOESN'T LIKE
ONE OF THE PIECES, HE'S GOING TO

591
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,602
PULL IT OUT.

592
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,770
ELIZABETH HAS SHOWN GREAT
LEADERSHIP UNDER PRESSURE.

593
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,314
THEY ARE BACK IN THIS RIGHT NOW.

594
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:28,902
IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST
COMEBACKS IN A "SURVIVOR"

595
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,653
CHALLENGE.

596
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,613
JASON STILL WORKING ON HIS
PUZZLE.

597
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,950
>> RIGHT NEXT TO THAT ON THE
RIGHT.

598
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,951
ELIZABETH PUT DOWN ANOTHER
PIECE.

599
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,786
SHE'S LYING WHAT SHE'S GOT
GOING.

600
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,662
JASON WILL HAVE TO PICK IT UP.

601
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,456
LAIRO WITH TWO PIECES LEFT.

602
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:41,873
>> CENTERPIECE.

603
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,458
LAST PIECE NOW.

604
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:43,959
>> FIND THAT TRIANGLE.

605
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,460
FIND THAT TRIANGLE.

606
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,128
>> Jeff: THIS COULD BE IT.

607
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:47,796
>> YES!

608
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,132
YES!

609
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,302
>> NO, NO.

610
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,136
KEEP GOING.

611
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,137
>> Jeff: LAIRO THOUGHT THEY
HAD IT.

612
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,806
>> THERE ARE TWO PIECES THAT WE
HAVE TO SWITCH.

613
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,848
>> PUSH IT BACK, PUSH IT BACK.

614
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,600
THERE YOU GO.

615
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,101
THE MIDDLE PIECE.

616
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:01,643
FIND THAT NOTCH.

617
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,478
FIND THAT NOTCH.

618
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,021
>> Jeff: JASON THINKS HE HAS
IT THIS TIME.

619
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,648
WILL THIS BE RIGHT?

620
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,774
>> YES!

621
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,109
>> YOU GOT IT?

622
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,820
VOKAI HAS IT.

623
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,531
VOKAI WINS IMMUNITY.

624
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,992
>> YOU NEVER GAVE UP!

625
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,661
>> Jeff: AN EPIC CHALLENGE
THAT CAME DOWN TO JUST A FEW

626
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,787
PIECES.

627
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:31,673
>> OH, MY GOSH.

628
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,676
>> VOKAI, CONGRATULATIONS.

629
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,719
IMMUNITY ONCE AGAIN IS YOURS.

630
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,137
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

631
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:37,721
ENJOY IT.

632
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,681
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT.

633
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,181
TAKE THE NIGHT OFF.

634
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,850
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

635
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,018
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

636
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,563
LAIRO, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT,
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FOURTH

637
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,690
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

638
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,108
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

639
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,192
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

640
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,736
>> EVERYBODY THINKS THAT
KARISHMA IS A DEAD FISH IN THE

641
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:57,699
WATER, AND HONESTLY SHE IS, BUT
IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT

642
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,908
IT.

643
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,703
I'M GOING TO KEEP KARISHMA NICE
AND FOLDED UP IN MY POCKET AND

644
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,496
USE HER VOTE.

645
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,584
IF I CAN HAVE TWO VOTES INSTEAD
OF ONE, THAT'S A GOOD DAY.

646
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,184
>> GUYS, I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M
SORRY.

647
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,228
I WAS THE LEADER TODAY AND I LET
YOU GUYS DOWN.

648
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,230
>> I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING, THAT
BUT WE PUT YOU IN THAT POSITION.

649
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:34,277
YOU DID FANTASTIC JOB.

650
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,405
>> ONCE AGAIN WE LOST THE
CHALLENGE.

651
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,368
I'M AT THE BOTTOM, SO I'M
EXPECTING IT TO BE UNANIMOUS

652
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,913
VOTE AGAINST KARISHMA, AND IT'S
KILLING ME.

653
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,084
THERE ARE CERTAINLY BIGGER
THREATS THAN ME, BUT THIS TRIBE

654
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,086
ARE A BUNCH OF PANSIES.

655
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,422
ALL THEY'RE DOING IS WHO IS THE
COMMON DENOMINATOR EVERYBODY CAN

656
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,716
LIVE WITH, AND TODAY IT'S ME.

657
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,427
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

658
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,763
NOT LIKE THIS.

659
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,890
>> THERE'S NO DOUBT ON THIS ONE.

660
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,309
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO TALK ABOUT.

661
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:06,726
THERE'S NO DISCUSSION.

662
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:12,982
>> NOT FOR ME.

663
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:17,070
>> KARISHMA'S NAME HAS BEEN OUT
THERE FOR A WHILE NOW.

664
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,614
SHE HASN'T DONE MUCH AROUND
CAMP.

665
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,659
SHE HASN'T CONTRIBUTED TOO MUCH
WHEN IT COMES TO PUZZLES OR

666
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,868
ATHLETICALLY IN CHALLENGES.

667
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,080
I FEEL LIKE SHE'S GOT TO SEE IT
COMING.

668
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,665
I DON'T THINK TONIGHT WILL BE A
BLIND SIDE.

669
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,835
>> I WANT TO STAY IN THE GAME
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

670
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:35,630
YOU KNOW, AT TRIBAL I'M GOING TO
SWING FOR THE FENCES.

671
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,631
>> DO IT.

672
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,133
GO OUT SWINGING.

673
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,759
PEOPLE CHALLENGE THEIR MINDS.

674
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,761
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN BEFORE.

675
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,265
>> KARISHMA IS MAKING HERSELF AN
OUTSIDER AND KNOWS HER TIME IS

676
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,809
COMING TO AN END, AND I KNOW
SHUE DOESN'T HAVE AN IDOL

677
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,145
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE THAT HAS IT.

678
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,355
SO I'M IN A REALLY GOOD SPOT.

679
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,483
I HAVE REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS
WITH PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY WITH

680
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:04,033
DEAN, AND I THINK THAT'S GOING
TO TAKE ME FAR IN THIS GAME.

681
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,952
>> I JUST FEEL SO BAD.

682
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:10,165
EVERYBODY ELSE'S FATE IS ON THE
LINE BECAUSE OF ME.

683
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,083
>> NOT AT ALL.

684
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,712
>> WE WORRY TICKLY IS FAR
BEHIND.

685
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,881
THE GAME NEEDS TO GET BLOWN UP
RIGHT NOW.

686
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,008
>> WE'RE GETTING EMBARRASSED.

687
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:25,138
>> THIS IS THE THING, I KEEP
LOOKING AT IT AND TODAY'S

688
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,682
PERFORMANCE, WHY ARE YOU HOPPING
OVER THE THING INSTEAD OF GOING

689
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:30,727
UNDER THE THING.

690
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,061
DEAN IS THE ONE I WANT GONE.

691
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,563
HE'S UNDERPERFORMING IN
CHALLENGES.

692
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,983
YOU'VE GOT CHELSEA IN HIS BACK
POCKET, AND HE'S PLAYING A SMILE

693
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,528
AT YOU, MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD KIND
OF GAME, TRYING TO FLY UNDER THE

694
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:40,987
RADAR.

695
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,113
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

696
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,533
SO HE'S GOT TO GO.

697
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,160
>> TERRIBLE.

698
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,036
IT'S GARBAGE.

699
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,038
>> I'M FINE WITH IT.

700
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,250
>> SO AARON PITCHES VOTING OUT
DEAN.

701
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,002
AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED.

702
00:29:56,085 --> 00:30:00,715
MAYBE HE HASN'T SHOWN UP FOR THE
CHALLENGES, BUT WHY SHOULD I

703
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,093
GIVE KARISHMA THE PRIVILEGE OF
MAKING IT FURTHER IN THIS GAME

704
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:08,097
WHEN DEAN IS AT LEAST GATHERING
FIREWOOD, HELPING COOK, BUILDING

705
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,350
THE SHELTER, WHILE KARISHMA
TAKES A NAP.

706
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,560
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

707
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,811
>> YOU HAVE TO BE ON BOARD.

708
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,938
>> I'M ON BOARD.

709
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,105
>> OKAY.

710
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,400
>> I SORT OF WAS GOING ALONG
WITH IT, BUT I'M NOT READY TO

711
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,404
SEE DEAN GO, NINE TEN DAYS AGO I
WOULD HAVE SAID, YES, WHATEVER

712
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,990
YOU NEED, HERE'S MY VOTE, I'LL
WRITE IT DOWN RIGHT NOW.

713
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,327
BUT WHILE I WAS ON THE ISLAND OF
THE IDOLIOUS BOSTON ROB SAID TO

714
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,412
ME, YOU HAVE TO LOOK BEFORE YOU
LEAP.

715
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,749
AND RIGHT NOW IVDON'T THINK
GETTING DEAN OUT IS GOOD FOR MY

716
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:40,880
GAME.

717
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:45,593
>> I'M NERVOUS.

718
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,428
DEN'S NAME IS BEING TOSSED
AROUND.

719
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,973
>> WHY?

720
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,768
AARON DOESN'T THINK HE COMPETES
IN THE CHALLENGES.

721
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,311
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GET RID
OF HIM.

722
00:30:55,395 --> 00:31:00,066
>> I DON'T EITHER, BUT MISSY IS
FULL ON BOARD.

723
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,276
>> HOLY CRAP.

724
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,280
AARON IS WANTING TO GO FOR DEAN,
AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT THE HELL?

725
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,948
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

726
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:12,620
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE AARON IS
SHADY.

727
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,332
>> KARISHMA IS GOING TO JUMP
SHIP.

728
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,003
AND THE PLAN IS TO NOT TELL
THEM.

729
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,964
>> I KNOW.

730
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,466
THAT'S INSANE.

731
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,095
>> AARON, YOU SNEAKY BASTARD.

732
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,807
IF HE'S WILLING TO CUT THE
THROAT OF HIS FRIEND, THEN

733
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,767
WHAT'S HE HE GOING TO DO TO ME
LATER ON?

734
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,478
I DON'T WANT TO VOTE DEAN, AND
IF THEY DON'T HAVE ME AND

735
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:46,029
ELIZABETH, THEY CAN'T PULL THAT
OFF.

736
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:54,704
>> SHE'S NOT ON BOARD?

737
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,497
>> THIS WILL ALIENATE CHELSEA
AND TOM.

738
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,665
>> THIS IS THE TARGET.

739
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,877
IT SEEMS LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE
IN THIS TRIBE THAT WANTS THE

740
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,086
PLAY THIS GAME.

741
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,339
EVERYBODY ELSE, THEY'RE TRYING
THE PLAY EVERYBODY'S TOGETHER

742
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,343
AND NO HURT FEELINGS, BUT AT
SOME POINT IN TIME, THIS GAME

743
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,303
HAS TO GET BLOODY.

744
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:17,143
THIS "KUMBAYA" NONSENSE HAS GOT
US INTO A HOLE AFTER TONIGHT.

745
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:23,483
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED, DOWN
A ROAD OF DISASTER.

746
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,568
>> SHE'S NOT WILLING TO ROCK THE
BOAT YET.

747
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,196
>> THIS TRIBE HAS A LOT OF
PEOPLE ON IT.

748
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,491
THEY'RE TOO WEAK AND AFRAID TO
MAKE A MOVE.

749
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,492
IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING.

750
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,495
>> WE GO BACK THE KEEPING
STRENGTH AROUND.

751
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,038
I'M LIKE, YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO PLAY "SURVIVOR."

752
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:41,209
YOU CAME HERE FOR A VACATION,
BUT I'M HERE TO PLAY THIS GAME

753
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,543
AND KIK SOME BUTT.

754
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,212
SO WE CAN'T AGREE ON DEAN.

755
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,338
WE CAN'T AGREE ON KARISHMA.

756
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:53,179
SO I NEED A NAME THAT NO ONE IS
COMPLETELY ATTACHED TO.

757
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,598
I WANT THE MAKE SURE WE DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR US.

758
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,225
>> I AGREE.

759
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:01,396
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS IN MY
OPINION DEAN AND CHELSEA.

760
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:01,771
YOU AGREE?

761
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,563
>> I AGREE.

762
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,691
>> THIS IS OUT OF THE BLUE.

763
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:09,237
IF IT'S TOO SCARY TO GET RID OF
TEEN, WOULD IT BE CHELSEA?

764
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,571
BECAUSE THEY'RE A PAIR.

765
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,739
THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

766
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,242
GIRLS KEEP MAJORITY, WE KEEP
THREE BIG GUYS AS PROTECTION FOR

767
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:20,581
US, AND THEN KARISHMA IS STILL
ANOTHER EASY VOTE TO GO LATER?

768
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:27,088
>> MISSY WITHIN TEN MINUTE FLIPS
THE TARGET ON THE CHELSEA, AND

769
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,090
HER ABILITY TO DROP NAMES ON A
DIME SCARED ME.

770
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,592
>> SHE WANTS TO GET CHELSEA OUT?

771
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,260
>> WHAT?

772
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:32,969
WHAT?

773
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,053
>> RIGHT NOW IT'S A BIG CLUSTER.

774
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,014
PEOPLE ARE HAVING SIDE
CONVERSATIONS WITH EVERYBODY,

775
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,934
AND THEY'RE ALL WHISPERING.

776
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,729
WITH THESE YAHOOS, YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO.

777
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,605
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO
GO DOWN.

778
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,442
THIS ONE IS GOING TO DRAW THE
LINE IN THE SAND AND IT'S GOING

779
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,693
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THEY
STAND.

780
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:53,698
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES, BUT IT'S
GOING TO BE REAL GUT CHECK TIME.

781
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:26,147
>> THEY JUST LOVE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

782
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,651
>> Jeff: SO, CHELSEA, DAY 11,
TWO TRIBAL COUNCILS, TWO

783
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,986
DEVASTATING BLIND SIDES.

784
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,404
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THIS
GROUP?

785
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:37,658
>> IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SAID LAST
TRIBAL, WE SUCK AS PUZZLES, BUT

786
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:43,998
WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT BLINDSIDES,
SO IT'S TRICKY BECAUSE THERE

787
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:47,877
HASN'T BEEN THAT LINE DRAWN IN
THE SATURDAY TONIGHT.

788
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,419
WILL IT BE DRAWN TONIGHT?

789
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,629
MAYBE, MAYBE IT WON'T.

790
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,463
>> Jeff: KARISHMA, SOUNDS VERY
FAMILIAR TO LAST TIME YOU WERE

791
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,715
HERE WHEN THERE WAS ANOTHER
BLINDSIDE.

792
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,510
>> I HAD A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE.

793
00:34:55,593 --> 00:35:00,973
I WAS A CONTINGENCY PLAN IN CASE
VINCE PLAYED AN IDOL.

794
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:05,019
BASED ON THAT, NOBODY WANTS THE
TALK TO ME.

795
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,313
>> Jeff: YET, YOU'RE STILL
HEAR.

796
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,689
>> "SURVIVOR" GODS.

797
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,024
EVERY DAY IS A NEW DAY.

798
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:10,691
THAT'S ALL I CAN HOPE FOR.

799
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,860
PRAYING TO THE "SURVIVOR" GODS.

800
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,072
>> Jeff: ELAINE, IS THAT YOUR
PERCEPTION, THAT SHE'S SITTING

801
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,324
AT CAMP GOING ANYONE, ANYONE,
BUELLER?

802
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,869
>> LISTEN, THESE PEOPLE ARE
MOVING SO FAST, I CAN'T EVEN

803
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,037
SEE.

804
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,372
THEY'RE LIKE EVERYWHERE.

805
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,917
TALK TO ONE PERSON, OH, YEAH,
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING.

806
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,877
TEN MINUTES LATER IT'S SOMETHING
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

807
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,214
I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

808
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,716
>> THIS ONE NEVER KNOWS
ANYTHING.

809
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,053
>> Jeff: DEAN, IS IT A GOOD
THING OR A BAD THING FOR

810
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,388
KARISHMA, WHO FEELS LIKE SHE'S
IN TROUBLE THAT THERE WAS SO

811
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,514
MUCH CHAOS.

812
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,892
>> IF I WERE IN KARISHMA'S
SHOES, THAT CHAOS SHOULD MEAN

813
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,977
POSITIVES THINGS.

814
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,353
BECAUSE IF EVERYONE IS
SCRAMBLING, THERE ARE PROBABLY

815
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,397
PLANS THAT DON'T INVOLVE
KARISHMA.

816
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,608
>> ?OO CHELSEA, IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU WERE NODDING IN AGREEMENT.

817
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,609
>> YOU SHOULD NEVER THROW THE
TOWEL IN.

818
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:57,238
CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING ON UP
UNTIL TRIBAL.

819
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,907
IF YOU STOP FOR A SECOND, YOUR
NAME COULD BE UP THERE, SO TALK

820
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,787
TO ANYONE, BECAUSE YOU CAN PUT
THAT LITTLE SEED OF DOUBT IN

821
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,414
SOMEONE'S MIND AND EVERYTHING
CAN CHANGE.

822
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,417
>> Jeff: AARON, IS THAT REALLY
ALL IT TAKES IS A TINY LITTLE

823
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,252
SEED OF DOUBT?

824
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,420
>> SURE.

825
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,548
I MEAN, THE RIGHT PERSON, THE
RIGHT SITUATION, THE RIGHT

826
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,801
CRACK, YOU SAY ONE LITTLE THING,
THAT LITTLE THING CAN BLOSSOM

827
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,260
INTO A FLOWER.

828
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,344
SO, YEAH.

829
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,055
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH, HOW DOES
THAT EQUATE TO STRATEGY?

830
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,766
BECAUSE IF YOU REACT TO THE
CHAOS, THEN YOU'RE LOST.

831
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,603
YOU'RE SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
LIKE ELAINE GOING YES, NO, HUH?

832
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,898
>> THAT'S -- YOU HIT THE NAIL ON
THE HEAD WITH THAT.

833
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,399
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW CAMP WENT
TODAY.

834
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,943
I THAWING WE WERE GOING IN WITH
A VERY CLEAR PLAN.

835
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,446
THAT EVOLVED INTO TWO, THREE,
FOUR, PLANS.

836
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,115
I NEED TO THINK ABOUT MOVE
THAT'S BEST FOR ME.

837
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,326
SOMETIME THAT'S THE LAST PLAN
THAT'S TALKED ABOUT AND THAT'S

838
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,411
THE ONE YOU GO WITH.

839
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,122
>> Jeff: ELAYNE, THAT HAS TO
BE UNNERVING.

840
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:51,334
>> YEAH, BECAUSE WHAT IF YOU'RE
THAT LAST PLAN THAT WAS TALKED

841
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,627
ABOUT.

842
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,088
THAT IS UNNERVING THAT PLAN "B"
COULD BE THE ONE IF THAT'S YOU.

843
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,926
>> Jeff: MISSY, NEVER HEARD
ANYONE PLAY PLAN Z, BUK THAT IS

844
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,594
WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE?

845
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,971
>> WE'RE PLAYING RUSSIAN
ROULETTE.

846
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,139
WE LOADED THE GUN.

847
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,432
IT'S GOING TO HIT SOMEBODY THAT
MAYBE IS NOT EXPECTING IT.

848
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:10,978
>> Jeff: WOW, KARISHMA, THAT'S
A PRETTY DARK BUT ACCURATE

849
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,021
METAPHOR?

850
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,316
>> I'M LOVING WHAT I'M HEARING
HERE AT TRIBAL TODAY.

851
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:20,947
>> I DON'T WANT HER TO LOVE WHAT
SHE'S HEARING BECAUSE THE STRAY

852
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,491
BULLET DOESN'T HIT SOMEONE, THAT
DOESN'T MEAN SHE CANNOT GET HIT

853
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,160
AND THAT DOES NOT MEAN SHE'S NOT
WITHOUT FAULT IN THIS GAME.

854
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:28,496
IF YOU OPEN UP AND SAY YOU'RE
THE PUZZLE MAKER, BE THE PUZZLE

855
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,372
MAKER.

856
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,999
IF YOU SAY YOU CAN SHOOT HOOP,
SHOOT HOOPS.

857
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,543
IF YOU SAY YOU'RE AN OLYMPIAN,
BE AN OLYMPIAN.

858
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:39,507
ALL OF US ARE PLAYING EQUALLY,
AND SHE'S GETTING LAPPED.

859
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:39,840
>> NICE.

860
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,132
GOOD JOB.

861
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,676
>> WOW.

862
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,471
>> ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THERE
WAS CHAOS, GREAT.

863
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:49,433
BECAUSE CHAOS IS A LADDER, AND
MAYBE I CAN CLIMB OUT OF MY

864
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,601
TRENCH.

865
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,854
>> Jeff: SO IF YOU'RE VOTED
OUT, WOULD YOU RATHER IT WAS A

866
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,482
BLINDSIDE OR TO BE, YEAH, I KNEW
THE ENTIRE TIME BECAUSE NOBODY

867
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,608
TALKED TO ME.

868
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,194
>> I WOULD RATHER BIT A
BLINDSIDE, BECAUSE THE SITUATION

869
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:04,156
I'M IN NOW, IF I'M VOTED OUT,
I'M EXPECTING IT.

870
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,241
IT WOULD HURT MORE.

871
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,994
>> Jeff: DEAN, WHAT'S THE
LETTER YOU WRITE TO SOMEBODY

872
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,996
AFTER YOU HAVE BLINDSIDED THEM.

873
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,039
>> DEPENDS HOW CLOSE YOU WERE.

874
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,043
BUT THERE'S SOME SORT OF SORRY
IN THERE AND THANKS FOR PLAYING.

875
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:16,585
>> Jeff: WOW.

876
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,420
WHY IS THAT SO FUNNY.

877
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,504
I'M LAUGHING, TOO.

878
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,547
SORRY, THANKS FOR PLAYING.

879
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,550
>> EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S GREAT
TO BLINDSIDE PEOPLE.

880
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,720
THAT'S PART OF "SURVIVOR" AND
THE THRILL, BUT WHEN YOU'RE ON

881
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,222
THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU'RE
WALKING OUT, YOU AIN'T GOING TO

882
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,390
BE LAUGHING.

883
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,892
>> Jeff: MISSY, WOULD YOU BE
SHOCKED IF IT WAS YOU TONIGHT?

884
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,102
DID YOUR NAME COME UP?

885
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,646
>> I DIDN'T HEAR MY NAME FROM
ANYONE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN MY

886
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,732
NAME WASN'T OUT THERE?

887
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,026
IF THEY'RE PLAYING A GOOD
BLINDSIDE, I WOULDN'T HEAR MY

888
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:40,985
NAME?

889
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,570
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF US
WOULD BE SHOCKED.

890
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,740
IF I WERE TO CUT HIM TO, CUT
ANYBODY, CAN YOU BLAME THEM?

891
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,076
WE DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE, AND
YET WE'RE LITERALLY LYING IN THE

892
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,244
DIRT LIKE DOGS TOGETHER.

893
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:54,081
IN SOME WAY WE'RE FAMILY, BUT IN
OTHER WAYS WE'RE COMPLETE

894
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:54,415
STRANGERS.

895
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,624
IT'S HARD.

896
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,460
>> Jeff: CHELSEA, IF YOU CAN
SEPARATE THE EMOTION, WHAT'S THE

897
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,087
PLEASURE IN A BLINDSIDE FROM A
PLAYER STANDPOINT?

898
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,467
>> I MEAN, IT'S A LITTLE SICK,
BUT WHEN YOU PULL OFF A

899
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,636
BLINDSIDE, THAT INNER PART OF
YOU SMILES BECAUSE YOU'RE LYING

900
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,266
LIKE, I'M PLAYING "SURVIVOR,"
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE

901
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,393
BLINDSIDED BECAUSE SOMEONE CLOSE
TO ME WAS LYING AND THAT HURTS.

902
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,479
IT'S NOT FUN TO CRUSH PEOPLE'S
DREAMS, BUT THAT'S PART OF THE

903
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,065
GAME, SO IT DEFINITELY IS FUN.

904
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,610
I LIKE IT.

905
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,112
>> IT COULD BE ANYBODY.

906
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,322
>> Jeff: OKAY.

907
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:26,781
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

908
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:34,872
DEAN, YOU'RE UP.

909
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:13,369
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

910
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,580
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

911
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:23,003
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

912
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,005
OKAY.

913
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,675
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

914
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:33,514
FIRST VOTE, KARISHMA.

915
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:39,145
KARISHMA.

916
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,565
CHELSEA.

917
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,607
CHELSEA.

918
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,403
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES KARISHMA,
TWO VOTES CHELSEA.

919
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,366
>> SHE'S LOOKING AROUND.

920
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,367
>> Jeff: CHELSEA.

921
00:40:53,451 --> 00:41:00,166
THAT'S THREE VOTES CHELSEA, TWO
VOTES KARISHMA.

922
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:00,749
CHELSEA.

923
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:07,006
THAT'S FOUR VOTES CHELSEA.

924
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,425
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT,
CHELSEA.

925
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:17,433
THAT'S FIVE, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

926
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:22,938
>> YOU WANTED A BLINDSIDE, YOU
GOT YOU ONE.

927
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:28,110
>> Jeff: CHELSEA, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

928
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,403
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

929
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:39,580
>> GOOD JOB.

930
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,416
>> Jeff: WELL, I GUESS THAT
WAS PLAN Z.

931
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,918
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

932
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,418
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

933
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:53,302
GOOD NIGHT.

>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

939
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:08,108
"SURVIVOR," IN A GAME OF LIES --
>> YOU'RE TALKING NONSENSE RIGHT

940
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:08,692
NOW.

941
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,568
>> YEAH, DEAN, IT WAS ME.

942
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,736
I TOOK YOUR GIRLFRIEND OUT OF
THIS GAME.

943
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,614
>> Jeff: NEW BATTLE LINES ARE
DRAWN.

944
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,534
DROP YOUR BUFFS.

945
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,077
>> WE DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

946
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,702
YOU CAN'T TRUST THEM.

947
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,788
>> THERE IS SO MUCH DANGER.

948
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,872
>> I NEED TO FLIP ON OLD LAIRO.

949
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,668
>> I'M COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY
BLINDSIDED.

950
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,753
I'M A HUGE SUPER FAN.

951
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:31,006
I DREAMED OF PLAYING "SURVIVOR"
SINCE I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD.

952
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,508
I THOUGHT I COULD WIN THIS GAME.

953
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:37,137
I HAVE AN IDOL IN MY POCK AND
COULD HAVE SAVED MYSELF, SO

954
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,806
OBVIOUSLY I'M JUST EMBARRASSED.

955
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:43,894
TO NOT EVEN MAKE THE MERGE, UH,
THIS IS SO DISAPPOINTING.
