1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:02,085
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,087
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,879
KIM AND THE WOMEN HAVE TAKEN OUT

4
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,214
THE MEN SYSTEMATICALLY SINCE THE

5
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,384
MERGE LEAVING TROYZAN

6
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,428
OUTNUMBERED ON THE CHOPPING

7
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,178
BLOCK.

8
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:12,929
WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL,

9
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,432
TROYZAN NEEDED TO WIN IMMUNITY.

10
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,892
TROYZAN COMES UP A LITTLE SHORT.

11
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,477
TARZAN REALLY TAKING HIS TIME.

12
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,230
TARZAN MOVES ON, TROYZAN IS OUT.

13
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,817
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

14
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,484
THE WOMEN BELIEVED TROYZAN MIGHT

15
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,945
HAVE ANOTHER HIDDEN IMMUNITY

16
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,405
IDOL AND DECIDED TO SPLIT THEIR

17
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:30,989
VOTE.

18
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,741
IT'S BEST TO BE SMART, WE

19
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,242
THROW TWO VOTES AT CHRISTINA.

20
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,119
Jeff: TROYZAN GOT WIND OF

21
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,329
THE PLAN WHEN CHRISTINA SPILLED

22
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:38,955
THE BEANS.

23
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,248
I HEARD MY NAME WILL BE

24
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:40,832
WRITTEN DOWN.

25
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,959
WHEN CHRISTINA SAID WHO

26
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,294
THEY'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTE

27
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,462
WITH I'M LIKE GREAT, THAT'S WHAT

28
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,463
I NEED TO HEAR.

29
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,756
Jeff: NEEDING ONLY ONE MORE

30
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,381
PERSON TO SHIFT THE VOTES

31
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,675
AGAINST CHRISTINA, TROYZAN

32
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,634
APPEALED TO KAT.

33
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,969
YOU ARE ON THE BOTTOM.

34
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:53,803
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CHANGING

35
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,262
YOUR MIND ABOUT WHO YOU'RE

36
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:54,679
VOTING FOR.

37
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,639
NEVER SAY DIE.

38
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,265
NOT IN "SURVIVOR."

39
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,933
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

40
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,852
CHRISTINA WAS ON THE HOT SEAT.

41
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,561
THERE ARE SIX WOMEN.

42
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,646
HAS THEREIN THERE BEEN MUCH TALK

43
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,314
ABOUT WHO IS NUMBER SIX?

44
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,691
I WOULDN'T SAY AMONGST ALL

45
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,400
SIX OF US.

46
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,194
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS WAS YOU

47
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,320
DIDN'T HAVE STRATEGY.

48
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,780
I HAVE BEEN STRATEGIZING

49
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,822
THROUGHOUT THE GAME.

50
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,032
I JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

51
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,534
Jeff: IN THE END... THE

52
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,203
11th PERSON VOTING OUT AND

53
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,455
FIFTH MEMBER OF THE JURY,

54
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,790
TROYZAN WAS THE FIFTH MAN BUT

55
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,332
DELIVERED A MESSAGE TO KAT

56
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,333
BEFORE HE LEFT.

57
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,794
DO IT.

58
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,503
Jeff: IT HAS BEEN THE

59
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,838
MISSION OF THIS GROUP TO GET RID

60
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,006
OF TROYZAN.

61
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,050
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

62
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:32,967
SEVEN ARE LEFT.

63
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,054
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

64
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,030
LIKE THAT WAS YOUR FINAL

65
00:01:54,113 --> 00:02:00,036
WORD?

66
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,163
IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT TROY IS

67
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:02,705
GONE.

68
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,206
I, LIKE, PHYSICALLY FEEL

69
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:03,915
RELIEVED.

70
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,167
LIKE, I FEEL, LIKE... YOU KNOW

71
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:06,751
WHEN YOU HAVE A PIT IN YOUR

72
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,045
STOMACH AND IT GOES AWAY?

73
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:09,379
THAT'S HOW I FEEL NOW THAT TROY

74
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,046
IS GONE.

75
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,340
HOW DID YOU GET THREE VOTES?

76
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,384
TROY PLAYED HER.

77
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,635
TROY SWITCHED HIS VOTE?

78
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,261
YUP.

79
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,554
YOU COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY

80
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,054
WENT HOME TODAY.

81
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,390
I KNOW I COULD HAVE.

82
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,559
TRIBAL TONIGHT JUST SHOWED

83
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:27,188
HOW STUPID CHRISTINA IS.

84
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,064
SEEING CHRISTINA ANSWER THE

85
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,190
QUESTIONS IN FRONT OF THE JURY

86
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,402
MADE HER LOOK DUMB WHEREAS

87
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,028
SABRINA ACTUALLY CAN TALK AND

88
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,405
SHE CAN SWAY THEM THE MORE SHE'S

89
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,406
LEFT HERE.

90
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,741
THE WHOLE TIME JONAS WAS

91
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,076
LOOKING AT CHRISTIE THAT LIKE

92
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,620
"WHY IS THIS GIRL STILL HERE?"

93
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,289
THE MORE CHRISTIE THAT OPENS HER

94
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,250
MOUTH AT TRIBAL COUNCIL IT'S SO

95
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,794
MUCH BETTER THAN HAVING SABRINA

96
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,420
THERE.

97
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,880
NOW IT'S JUST US GIRLS AND

98
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,882
TARZAN AND HE'S REALLY NOT A

99
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:54,507
THREAT.

100
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,426
BUT SABRINA SCARES ME SO I

101
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,719
PERSONALLY DON'T WANT HER HERE.

102
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,220
SO I'M NOT WORRIED.

103
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,431
I THINK I'M SITTING IN A PERFECT

104
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,140
SPOT.

105
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:02,849
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT

106
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,268
I'M THE MISFIT OR THAT I'M AT

107
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,979
THE BOTTOM AND LITTLE DO THEY

108
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,982
KNOW I'M AT THE TOP CONTROLLING

109
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:11,733
EVERYTHING.

110
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,650
I'M THE MOST POWERFUL PLAYER IN

111
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,777
THIS GAME.

112
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:38,176
TREEMAIL!

113
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,553

114
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,805
SPRINT, I LOVE YOU!

115
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,808
OH, MY GOD!

116
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,977
SO SABRINA AND I GET TREEMAIL

117
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,646
AND WHEN I LIFTED THE BOX AND

118
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,980
SAW "SPRINT" I ALREADY KNEW WHAT

119
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,149
WAS HAPPENING.

120
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,150
GATHER EVERYONE AROUND.

121
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,402
COME CLOSER.

122
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,987
WE HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A

123
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,824
FREAKING PUZZLE.

124
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,992
PSYCH!

125
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,535
STOP SHAKING IT!

126
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,871
WE HAVE VIDEO MAIL!

127
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,206
OH, MY GOSH!

128
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,333
OH, MY GOSH!

129
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,210
"YOU'VE BEEN LIVING A LIFE

130
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,128
WITHOUT LIMITS AND SIMPLICITY

131
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,338
PROVIDES YOUR POWER.

132
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,340
WHEN SPONTANEOUS DECISIONS BREED

133
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,385
SUCCESS, IT'S MORE THAN FOOD YOU

134
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,135
SHALL DEVOUR."

135
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,220
OH, MY GOD!

136
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,221
SHH!

137
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,806
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY QUIET!

138
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,225
HELLO, SABRINA.

139
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,353
(SCREAMING)

140
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,981
YOU'RE ON THE ISLAND.

141
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,607
YOUR ABSENCE IS A VOID IN

142
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,233
EVERYONE'S HEART.

143
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,359
TODAY WE GOT TREEMAIL FROM

144
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,110
SPRINT.

145
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:37,777
I NEVER THOUGHT SPRINT COULD BE

146
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,196
SO GOOD TO ME AND IT WAS MY

147
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,197
BROTHER WHO CAME ALL THE WAY OUT

148
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:41,906
TO THE ISLAND.

149
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,449
HOPEFULLY I'LL GET TO SEE HIM

150
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,575
AND SPEND TIME WITH HIM TODAY.

151
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,536
HI, SISTER!

152
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,370
OH!

153
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,247
ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS YOU

154
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,206
BETTER WIN THE NEXT CHALLENGE

155
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,040
BECAUSE I HAD TO WORK TWO

156
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,750
DOUBLES TO MAKE THIS TRIP

157
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,376
HAPPEN.

158
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,043

I LOVE YOU AND I HOPE YOU'RE

160
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,839
DOING WELL.

161
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,258
HEY, CHELSEA!

162
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,968
CAME A LONG WAY DOWN HERE TO SEE

163
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,052
YOU ON THIS ISLAND.

164
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,178
IT'S GORGEOUS.

165
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,555
HOPE YOU'RE DOING WELL.

166
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,931
EVERYBODY BACK HOME IS SAYING

167
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,558
HOW MUCH THEY LOVE YOU AND MISS

168
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,225
YOU.

169
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,184
WE THINK ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.

170
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,395
I LOVE MY DAD.

171
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,772
HI, CHRISTINA.

172
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,232
OH, MY GOD, MY DAD.

173
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,192
I HOPE YOU'RE DOING WELL AND

174
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:18,609
I HOPE THAT YOU'RE NOT SUFFERING

175
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,778
AS MUCH AS I AM.

176
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,572
MY DAD JUST GOT A KIDTY

177
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,239
TRANSPLANT LAST YEAR.

178
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,782
HE ONLY HAS ABOUT FIVE TO TEN

179
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,242
YEARS TO LIVE.

180
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,618
HE'S ONLY 53 AND I WANT TO DO SO

181
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,581
MUCH FOR HIM AND, YES, IT'S

182
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,290
URGENT.

183
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,958
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WHATEVER I'M

184
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,251
DOING RIGHT NOW IS NEVER ENOUGH

185
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:35,835
AND I NEED TO DO MORE.

186
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,589
I LOVE YOU AND I AM VERY

187
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,759
PROUD OF YOU.

188
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,886
HI, KIM.

189
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,428
I'M HERE.

190
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,095
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

191

SHE SETS HER GOAL AND SHE'S LIKE

297
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,620

303
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,796

BEING THE TOUGH WOMAN OUT HERE,

325
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,458
I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY IS SEEING

00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,459
RIGHT NOW IS THE LITTLE GIRL.

327
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,002

00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,837
Jeff: YOUR FACE LOOKS

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,296

330
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,006

RESILIENT BUT THIS IS AMAZING.

344
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,192
SHE'S TRULY A SOLDIER.

345
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,528
WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT HIM IS

346
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,863
THAT HE PUTS ME BEFORE HIMSELF

347
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,615

I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE'S

00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,951
THE EVO 3D FROM SPRINT.

569
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,078
WITH THAT YOU CAN RECORD SOME

570
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,246
MEMORIES, TAKE SOME VIDEOS, TAKE

571
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,373
SOME PHOTOS.

572
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,125
FOR THE REST OF YOU, TIME TO SAY

573
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,252
GOOD-BYE TO YOUR LOVED ONES.

574
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,712
YOU DON'T HAVE LONG, ALL

575
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,254
RIGHT?

576
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:45,629
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

577
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,340
I LOVE YOU.

578
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,341
BYE, GUYS.

579
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,926
HAVE FUN.

580
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,344
GOD, SHE SHOULD HAVE PICKED

581
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,262
YOU, TARZAN.

582
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,888
TARZAN AND CHRISTINA SHOULD HAVE

583
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,099
BEEN THE ONES TO GO.

584
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,101
CHRISTINA, TARZAN, CHELSEA,

585
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,310
GRAB YOUR STUFF HEAD BACK TO

586
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:00,978
CAMP.

587
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,604
GUYS, YOU SHOULD HAVE A FUN

588
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,272
AFTERNOON.

589
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,274
GET OUT OF HERE, GO ENJOY IT.

590
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,693
I FELT LIKE THAT WAS A REALLY

591
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,318
SELFISH DECISION FOR KAT NOT TO

592
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,112
TAKE TARZAN AND CHRISTINA.

593
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,114
I DON'T KNOW HOW ANGRY THEY'RE

594
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,991
GOING TO BE BUT I'M GOING TO

595
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:14,450
HAVE DO MAJOR DAMAGE CONTROL

596
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,161
BACK AT CAMP.

597
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,548
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LUNCH

598
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,257
IS READY NOW.

599
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,883
HELP YOURSELF.

600
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,301
I FEEL LIKE A WON THE BEST

601
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:32,676
REWARD.

602
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,261
LIKE, I WON!

603
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,929
YOU SEE ME AT THIS CHALLENGE?

604
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,140
IT'S LIKE, YES, I WON SOMETHING!

605
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,309
AND I REALLY DESERVED TO WIN,

606
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:40,893
DANG IT!

607
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,602
I HAVEN'T WON ANYTHING!

608
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,312
I REALLY JUST WANTED TO SPEND

609
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,522
TIME WITH KIM AND ALICIA ON A

610
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,732
GENUINE FRIENDSHIP LEVEL.

611
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,441
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE PICKED

612
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,318
THOSE TWO PEOPLE STRATEGICALLY

613
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,861
BUT I DID AND YOU CAN'T GO BACK

614
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,487
ON IT.

615
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,863
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

616
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,656
AM I GOING TO DWELL ON IT?

617
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,867
NO, I'LL EAT MY CAKE, GET DRUNK

618
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,327
AND GO BACK TO THE TRIBE AND

619
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,328
DEAL WITH THEM LATER.

620
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,163
IT'S GOOD TO FINALLY MEET

621
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:01,747
Y'ALL.

622
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,123
US THREE, DAY ONE IT WAS

623
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:03,457
ALREADY DONE.

624
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,666
UH-HUH.

625
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,001
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

626
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,711
SO OUR WHOLE TRIBE WAS ALL

627
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,630
WOMEN, NOW WE HAVE SIX GIRLS

628
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,297
LEFT.

629
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,882
WE ELIMINATED ALL THE GUYS.

630
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,926
RIGHT NOW SERVE SO IN CHECK.

631
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,511
TARZAN IS IN CHECK.

632
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,345
SABRINA IS IN CHECK, THAT'S WHY

633
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,514
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE OUT

634
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,348
SABRINA BEFORE CHRISTINA BECAUSE

635
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,016
CHRISTINA KNOWS THE DEAL.

636
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,310
THIS REWARD IS THE ONE TIME

637
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,728
WE WERE ABLE TO FINALLY TALK

638
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,938
ABOUT OUR FINAL THREE.

639
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:26,855
DO I BELIEVE THIS IS THE FINAL

640
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,314
THREE?

641
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:27,856
YES.

642
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,025
DO I WANT TO JINX IT NO?

643
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,652
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT

644
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,361
IT.

645
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,655
IT'S A SERIOUSLY CONFIDENTIAL

646
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,364
SITUATION.

647
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,323
THE LONGER I DO THIS THE MORE

648
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,576
I THINK THIS IS MY BEST OPTION.

649
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,369
THESE GUYS?

650
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,370
UH-HUH.

651
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,037
TO WIN.

652
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,039
I DON'T THINK ALICIA WILL GET

653
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,040
MANY VOTES.

654
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,208
SHE'S NOT WELL LIKED.

655
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,170
BUT SHE'S DELUSIONAL ABOUT THAT

656
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,047
AND KAT, SHE WOULD BE THE PERSON

657
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,882
THAT WOULD HAVE A SHOW LIKE HOW

658
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,050
A MILLION DOLLARS RUIN MID-LIFE

659
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,426
IN A YEAR AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW

660
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,553
WHERE SHE SPENT THE MONEY.

661
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,680
MY WHOLE PLOY TO BOTH OF THEM IS

662
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,931
YOU'RE GOING TO KICK MY ASS IN

663
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,599
THE END BUT I WOULD BE REALLY

664
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,393
SURPRISED IF THERE'S ANYBODY

665
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,936
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT I

666
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,689
WOULD SAY STAKE WITH THEM.

667
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,732
FINAL THREE TALK IS HAPPENING

668
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,316
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

669
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,442
WE HAVE TO DO VIDEOS.

670
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,694
DO IT!

671
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,445
I FEEL LIKE THIS MAY BE MY

672
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,573
BEST OPTION TO GO WITH KAT AND

673
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,074
ALICIA WHO I FEEL LIKE I CAN

674
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:19,741
BE... THEY WANT TO VOTE OFF

675
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,786
SABRINA BUT I'VE HAD AN ALLIANCE

676
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,037
WITH SABRINA SINCE THE BEGINNING

677
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,372
SO I WOULD BE VOTING OUT SOMEONE

678
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,707
THAT I WAS PREVIOUSLY IN THE TOP

679
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,416
THREE WITH.

680
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,917
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF I

681
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,626
DON'T THINK I CAN WIN AGAINST

682
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,253
SABRINA THAT WOULD BE STUPID TO

683
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,588
TAKE HER TO THE FINAL THREE WITH

684
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:39,011
ME.

685
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,054
DUDE, I AM SO MAD RIGHT NOW.

686
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,222
LIKE, HONESTLY, IF KAT WOULD

687
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:42,764
HAVE PICKED ME I WOULD HAVE SAID

688
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,474
NO, TARZAN'S GOING.

689
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,142
I WOULD HAVE SWITCHED OUT.

690
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,768
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND YOU TWO

691
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,769
SHOULD HAVE WENT.

692
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,437
PERIOD.

693
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,272
WHAT IT WAS, IT WAS TOTALLY

694
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:50,564
SELFISH.

695
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,231
TRUE.

696
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,274
MAYBE IF I BEGGED SHE WOULD

697
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:52,566
HAVE TAKEN ME.

698
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,233
NO.

699
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,110
I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD HAVE

700
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:55,819
TAKEN YOU.

701
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,778
THAT'S HOW SHE IS.

702
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,529
I WOULD HAVE PICKED TARZAN.

703
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,825
THAT'S JUST THE OBVIOUS CHOICE.

704
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,659
BECAUSE THIS MAN NEEDS TO SEE

705
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,453
HIS WIFE, PERIOD.

706
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,829
THEN CHRISTINA BECAUSE OF THE

707
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,663
KIDNEY TRANSPLANT, HER DAD MAY

708
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,456
HAVE A COUPLE YEARS LEFT.

709
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,375
SO THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF.

710
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,795
KAT IS A BRATTY 23-YEAR-OLD WHO

711
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,464
DOESN'T DESERVE TO GO TO THE
END.

712
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,633
THIS IS DEFINITELY ENOUGH REASON

713
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,759
TO MAKE ME VOTE OFF KAT.

714
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,426
YEAH.

715
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,093
EASILY.

716
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,304
I THINK SHE'S IN THE FIRING

717
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,472
LINE BUT I THINK SHE'S AT THE

718
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,307
END OF THE FIRING LINE.

719
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,476
THAT'S UP TO US, THOUGH,

720
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,060
TARZAN.

721
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:28,644
WHEN WE WANT HER OFF.

722
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,520
WHAT IF ME, CHRISTINA,

723
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,690
SABRINA, KIM AND YOU WANT KAT

724
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,358
OUT?

725
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,860
WELL, IF THAT WERE THE CASE,

726
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,028
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE AN

727
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,530
ERROR BECAUSE KAT IS NOT A

728
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,198
THINKER.

729
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:41,907
I THINK THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE

730
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,325
THINKING WOULD LEAVE HER IN HERE

731
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,786
LONGER KNOWING FULL WELL THAT AT

732
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,662
ANY TIME IS...

733
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,997
IT'S BASICALLY HER SOCIAL

734
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,498
GAME WITH ALL THE GUYS.

735
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,082
THAT...

736
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,708
IS THAT WHAT WORRIES YOU?

737
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,043
THAT WORRIES ME.

738
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,503
YEAH, ME, TOO.

739
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,504
KAT SCREWED UP NOW THE TARGET

740
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,839
IS ON HER BACK.

741
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,548
PLUS I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS

742
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,509
TO GO TO THE END WITH KAT

743
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,302
BECAUSE LAST TRIBAL TROY

744
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,512
WHISPERED IN HER EAR "YOU CAN DO

745
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,137
IT.

746
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,598
"SO THAT'S MAKING US ALL A

747
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,724
LITTLE NERVOUS.

748
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,517
NERVOUS.

749
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,810
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET EVERYONE

750
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,352
TO VOTE KAT?

751
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:10,894
ALL WE NEED IS FOUR.

752
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,188
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

753
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,564
TALKING WITH KIM WHEN SHE GETS

754
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,273
BACK.

755
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,984
I JUST HOPE WE AGREE THAT KAT IS

756
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,069
A SMART PERSON TO TAKE OUT NEXT.

757
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,209
WHEN WE GOT BACK HERE THERE

758
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,502
WERE SOME PISSED OFF PEOPLE.

759
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,045
EVERYONE'S WANTING KAT OUT NEXT.

760
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,006
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT SABRINA

761
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:39,464
FIRST.

762
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,674
ALICIA AND KAT?

763
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,217
I SPENT THE DAY WITH THESE

764
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,552
TWO AND THEY THINK WE'RE A

765
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,136
THREAT.

766
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,513
THAT'S HOW DUMB THEY ARE.

767
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,891
SAB IS NOT DUMB.
THEY'RE DUMB.

768
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,560
SO YOU THINK SAB TONIGHT?

769
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,562
I THINK IT'S OUR BEST PLAN.

770
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,229
OKAY.

771
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,273
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE

772
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,233
END WITH KAT.

773
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,569
I'M THINKING IT'S IMMUNITY

774
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,237
TODAY AND WE HAVE DECIDED

775
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,030
SABRINA IS GOING HOME FOR SURE.

776
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,574
I DO THINK SHE HAS A GOOD SHOT
OF

777
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,616
GETTING A LOT OF JURY VOTES

778
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,577
BECAUSE SHE'S PERSUASIVE.

779
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,245
SO IT'S SO IMPORTANT WHO WINS

780
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:11,580
BECAUSE WE HAVE A PLAN AND IF

781
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,789
SOMEBODY WINS IMMUNITY THAT WAS

782
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,041
SUPPOSED TO GO HOME IT'S GOING

783
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,250
TO BE CHAOS.

784
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:15,500
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

785
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,086
NO.

786
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,422
WE JUST NEED TO SEE WHO WINS

787
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,089
IMMUNITY.

788
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,759
SABRINA BETTER NOT PULL OUT A

789
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,426
SUPERSTAR ACT.

790
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,635
I THINK AT SOME POINT IN THIS

791
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,511
GAME I STARTED TO THINK, WELL,

792
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,056
MAYBE IT'S NOT SMART IF I WIN

793
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:29,973
IMMUNITY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF

794
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,059
I'LL EVER FEEL SAFE SO I'VE JUST

795
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:32,768
DECIDED AT THIS POINT IF I CAN

796
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,062
TAKE EVERY IMMUNITY FROM HERE ON

797
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,147
OUT I WILL.

798
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:52,704
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

805
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,594

YOU'LL BE HOLDING ON THE A

810
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,185

THAT HANDLE IS ATTACHED TO A

WINCH.

813
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,481
EVERY TIME I CRANK IT, IT WILL

814
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:23,151
LOWER YOU CLOSER TO THE WATER.

815
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,778
WHEN THE STRAIN BECOMES TOO MUCH

816
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,988

00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,491

EVERY TIME I MOVE THIS, THAT BAR

LETS OUT A LITTLE MORE ROPE AND

842
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:25,547
YOU FALL CLOSER TO THAT WATER.

843
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,216
OH, MY GOD!

845
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,052
LITTLE MORE STRESS NOW.

846
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,763
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD ON.

847
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,224
THAT'S IT.

848
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:36,766
JUST HANG ON LONGER THAN

849
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:47,611
EVERYBODY ELSE.

850
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:52,782
EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,576
BEEN UP THERE TEN MINUTES.

852
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,578

854
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:04,669

GO AHEAD AND DROP IN THE WATER.

00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:27,275
WE'RE DOWN TO SIX.

861
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,735
TARZAN IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE

862
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,238
AND WE ARE DOWN TO FIVE WOMEN

863
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,447

IN YOUR ALLIANCE, YOU ARE CRAZY

869
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:46,711
IF YOU THINK YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

870
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:58,098
SAFE.

871
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,308
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

DIG DEEP.

881
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,161
I CAN'T DO IT.

882
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:24,791
MY FINGERS ARE SLIPPING.

883
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,043
OH, GOD.

884
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,378

SHOULD I STEP OFF?

891
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,601
I'M GOING TO JUMP.

892
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,395
MY FINGER'S KILLING ME.

00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:45,895
GOOD LUCK, GIRLS.

894
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:46,730

WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

898
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,528

WOW.

904
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,550
Jeff: PERFECT TIME TO MAKE

905
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,551

IT LOOKS SO INCREMENTAL VISUALLY

909
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,237
BUT I KNOW WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE

910
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:41,910
THAT'S ADDING TO YOUR BODY.

911
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,036

00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,156
OUT WHO IT'S GOING TO BE.

945
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,159
I WILL SEE YOU GUYS AT TRIBAL.

946
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,326
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND GET BACK TO
CAMP. CONGRATS.

947
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,370
I'M GLAD KIM WON IMMUNITY BUT

948
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,663
I'M NOT SURE SABRINA SHOULD BE

949
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:09,998
THE NEXT TO GO.

950
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:15,128
I THINK KAT, JUST HER
SELFISHNESS THROUGHOUT THIS
WHOLE GAME

951
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,005
SO SHE SHOULD BE NEXT
TO GO

952
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,131
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF TALKING

953
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,216
THAT NEEDS TO GO ON.

954
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:29,851
I COMMEND Y'ALL FOR STAYING

955
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:30,435
THAT LONG.

956
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:34,147
THAT WAS PRETTY BRUTAL.

957
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,023
ARE YOU HURTING?

958
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,024
YEAH.

959
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,067
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

960
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,195
KICKING YOUR ASS.

961
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,404
I'M REALLY UPSET ABOUT THE

962
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,113
CHALLENGE.

963
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,615
I MEAN, TO LOSE TO SOMEONE WHO'S

964
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,366
28 YEARS OLD WHO'S SIX YEARS

965
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,034
OLDER THAN ME?

966
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,536
IT'S LIKE HOW EMBARRASSING IS

967
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,204
THAT?

968
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,163
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE HER

969
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,166
MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

970
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,918
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVER

971
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,045
GOING TO BE ABLE TO BEAT HER IN

972
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:57,712
CHALLENGES.

973
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:58,421
DID KIM TALK TO YOU TODAY?

974
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,380
NOT YET.

975
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,673
SHE ALREADY KNOWS THAT WE

976
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,007
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

977
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,218
SABRINA.

978
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,719
OKAY.

979
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:05,303
D'UH.

980
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,180
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

981
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,057
SABRINA HAS NO IDEA HER ASS

982
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,766
IS ON THE LINE.

983
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,518
THAT'S WHY A BLIND SIDE IS SO

984
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:11,809
GREAT.

985
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,519
I AGREE.

986
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,062
IT'S AMAZING HOW WE CONTROL

987
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:14,646
THE SHOW.

988
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,857
THIS GAME IS OUR GAME.

989
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,108
OH, MY GOD.

990
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,068
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE YESTERDAY I

991
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,861
WAS LIKE, SABRINA?

992
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,446
YOU'RE GOING HOME.

993
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,615
THEN TODAY AT THE CHALLENGE, I

994
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,242
MEAN, DID YOU SEE SABRINA?

995
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,368
SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE DONE.

996
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,620
I MEAN, I COULD BEAT HER.

997
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,247
SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY SABRINA

998
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,374
NEEDS TO GO.

999
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,626
BUT KAT, SHE JUST BROUGHT IT.

1000
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,961
HOME GIRL WAS GIVING IT HER AL

1001
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,255
AND, LIKE, THAT'S SOMEBODY THAT

1002
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,631
I DO NOT WANT TO GO UP AGAINST

1003
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,132
IF THAT'S HOW SHE'S GOING TO

1004
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:50,390
PLAY THESE CHALLENGES.

1005
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,392
PLEASE TELL ME WE'RE ON THE

1006
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,059
SAME WAVELENGTH SO WE KEEP

1007
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,937
SABRINA AND WE TAKE OUT KAT?

1008
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,479
NO.

1009
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,565
I WANT AN EASIER WIN.

1010
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,983
I CAN'T KEEP GOING UP AGAINST

1011
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:00,608
KAT.

1012
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,151
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1013
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,111
I DON'T WANT IT TO GET LIKE A

1014
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,154
TROY THING WHERE WE CAN'T GET

1015
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:05,822
KAT OUT.

1016
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,366
ALICIA CAME UP TO ME AND SHE

1017
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,909
SAID "I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT

1018
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:10,451
INTO THIS POSITION BUT KAT HAS

1019
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,160
TO GO IMMEDIATELY."

1020
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:11,995
I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED.

1021
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,956
I SAW SOME BIG LOGS RIGHT

1022
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,623
THERE THERE.

1023
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,124
I'M GOING TO GO IN A SECOND.

1024
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:16,416
NICE.

1025
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,961
HEY.

1026
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,712
KAT.

1027
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:21,546
THAT'S THE VOTE?

1028
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,298
I MEAN DID YOU SEE HOW HARD

1029
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,465
SHE WENT ON THAT CHALLENGE?

1030
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,092
AS MUCH AS YOU THINK SHE

1031
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,010
CAN'T WIN, SHE CAN.

1032
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,429
I DO THINK KAT HAS A GOOD

1033
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,306
SHOT AT GETTING A LOT OF JURY

1034
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,515
VOTES BECAUSE SHE HASN'T PISSED

1035
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,224
A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF.

1036
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,976
BUT I THINK SABRINA'S A BIGGER

1037
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:35,685
THREAT.

1038
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,812
SHE'S SMART ENOUGH TO SWAY THE

1039
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:39,731
JURY AND TOTALLY SCREW ME OVER

1040
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,315
IN THE END.

1041
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,317
LET'S JUST STOP TALKING.

1042
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,443
THAT'S THE VOTE?

1043
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,152
OKAY, GOOD.

1044
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,778
I WOULD RATHER SEE SABRINA GO

1045
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,989
FIRST BEFORE WE TAKE KAT OUT.

1046
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,782
SO KAT'S GOING TO VOTE SABRINA

1047
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,117
AND I THINK TARZAN WOULD BE

1048
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,494
WILLING TO GET RID OF SABRINA.

1049
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,204
SO IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE CHELSEA

1050
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,833
AND I ARE THE SWING VOTES.

1051
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,711
ALICIA CAME TO ME AND SHE'S

1052
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:02,795
REALLY, REALLY WORRIED KAT IS

1053
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,504
GOING TO WIN.

1054
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,048
NOW SHE WANTS TO TAKE KAT OUT

1055
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:05,465
NEXT.

1056
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,133
OH, MY GOD!

1057
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,176
YEAH.

1058
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,470
SHE'S LIKE "SHE'S GONNA WIN."

1059
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,347
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT BENEFITS

1060
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:12,972
US.

1061
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,681
I'LL START THINKING ABOUT

1062
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,850
THAT AND THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS

1063
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,352
BECAUSE SAB IS SO SMART.

1064
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,397
ALL OF A SUDDEN ALICIA AN I

1065
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,732
ARE ON THE SAME PAGE THAT KAT

1066
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:23,816
NEEDS TO GO.

1067
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,776
SHE'S SELFISH AND DOESN'T

1068
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,027
DESERVE TO BE IN THE FINAL

1069
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,736
THREE.

1070
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,195
BUT KIM STILL WANTS TO VOTE OUT

1071
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:27,904
SABRINA.

1072
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,031
I UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE'S COMING

1073
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,532
FROM, BUT I FEEL LIKE SABRINA'S

1074
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,034
BEEN ON KIM AND I'S SIDE SINCE

1075
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:33,743
DAY ONE.

1076
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,286
SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT SINCE

1077
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,038
SHE HAS HER MIND-SET ON KAT THAT

1078
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,165
WE SHOULD TAKE HER OUT FIRST?

1079
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,583
WELL, I WOULD SAY SHE

1080
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,250
DOESN'T...

1081
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:41,918
BEFORE SHE CHANGES HER MIND?

1082
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,252
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE

1083
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,255
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO.

1084
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,175
KIM AND I ARE GOING TO AGREE

1085
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,385
100% ON WHAT WHATEVER WE DECIDE

1086
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,220
TO DO BUT I THINK FROM HERE ON

1087
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,389
OUT IT'S GOING TO BE A KAT

1088
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:59,018
FIGHT.

1089
00:32:59,102 --> 00:32:59,769
ARE YOU GOOD FOR TONIGHT?

1090
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:00,436
I'VE BEEN TOLD KAT.

1091
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,605
I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S THE

1092
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,899
CASE ANYMORE.

1093
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,526
I STILL HAVE SOME CHOICES FOR

1094
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,027
SURE TONIGHT BUT CHELSEA AND I

1095
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,195
HAVE HAD AN ALLIANCE WITH

1096
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,238
SABRINA SINCE DAY ONE AND KAT, I

1097
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,281
THINK SHE LOOKS AT ME LIKE A BIG

1098
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,868
SISTER SO THIS IS NOT A FUN VOTE

1099
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,536
TONIGHT.

1100
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,829
WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY SMART.

1101
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:18,371
OKAY.

1102
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:21,499
ALL RIGHT BOSS LADY.

1103
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,291
STOP!

1104
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,209
THAT'S TRUE.

1105
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,253
TO ME IT'S A GAME-CHANGING

1106
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:25,962
DECISION.

1107
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,672
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE A CHOICE AND

1108
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,923
IT'S GOING TO BE A BLIND SIDE

1109
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:29,549
EITHER WAY BUT THIS IS A GAME

1110
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,801
AND THERE'S NO WAY TO KEEP

1111
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,927
EVERYBODY HAPPY AT THIS POINT IN

1112
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,594
THE GAME.

1113
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,929
IT'S GOING TO GO TO HELL FROM

1114
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,056
HERE ON OUT.

1115
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:49,402
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1116
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:56,576
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1117
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,662
JONAS, MICHAEL, JAY, LEIF, AND

1118
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,080
TROYZAN VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1119
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:08,629
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1120
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,883
SO, KAT, WE GO FROM LAST WEEK

1121
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,301
WHERE YOU'RE DEVASTATED BECAUSE

1122
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,302
YOU DON'T GET PICKED TO GO ON

1123
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,846
THE REWARD TO THIS WEEK WHERE

1124
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,973
YOU NOW HAVE THE GOOD NEWS/BAD

1125
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,475
NEWS SCENARIO OF GETTING TO PICK

1126
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,310
TWO PEOPLE TO GO ALONG WITH YOU,

1127
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,269
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE LEAVING THE

1128
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,479
OTHER FOUR BEHIND.

1129
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,272
IT WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST

1130
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,108
THING I'VE EVER HAD TO DO IN MY

1131
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:29,817
LIFE.

1132
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,985
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF

1133
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,653
THESE BEAUTIFUL FACES WITH THEIR

1134
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,070
FAMILIES AND YOU HAVE TO PICK

1135
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,113
TWO PEOPLE.

1136
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,323
IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING AND IT

1137
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,492
DOES HURT MY FEELINGS.

1138
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,702
Jeff: IT HURTS "YOUR"

1139
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,411
FEELINGS?

1140
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:40,995
YEAH, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

1141
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,330
SEE THEIR FACES BE MAD.

1142
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,207
Jeff: HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO

1143
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:44,916
UNDERSTAND.

1144
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,250
LAST REWARD CHALLENGE KIM DIDN'T

1145
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,877
PICK YOU.

1146
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,962
FIRST PERSON YOU PICK IS KIM.

1147
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:50,588
YES.

1148
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,339
STRATEGICALLY I COULD HAVE

1149
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,509
PICKED TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT

1150
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,719
AT THAT TIME I WAS THINKING MORE

1151
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,555
LIKE WHO WOULD I HAVE A GREAT

1152
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,349
TIME WITH NOT THINKING

1153
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,016
STRATEGICALLY.

1154
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:02,975
NOW, THAT'S MY OWN CHOICE.

1155
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,936
Jeff: SABRINA, DO YOU BUY

1156
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:05,686
THAT?

1157
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,188
THAT KAT WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT

1158
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,356
STRATEGY WHEN SHE PICKED TWO OF

1159
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,525
THE PEOPLE WHO WENT ON THE LAST

1160
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,150
REWARD?

1161
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:11,901
I DON'T THINK STRATEGY HAD

1162
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,528
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

1163
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,197
I THINK HONESTLY THE 22-YEAR-OLD

1164
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,740
LIKE "I WANT TO HAVE FUN."

1165
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,950
AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING SHE'S

1166
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,035
GOING TO LOOK BACK AT AND REGRET

1167
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:22,036
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE UP HERE

1168
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,246
WOULD HAVE PICKED TARZAN AND

1169
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,914
CHRISTINA SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

1170
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,959
THEIR LOVED ONES BACK STORY.

1171
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,210
BUT IT'S HER CHOICE.

1172
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:29,877
Jeff: .

1173
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,339
JEFF, AGAIN, I AM 22, I AM A

1174
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,841
LITTLE NAIVE AND I'M SORRY THAT

1175
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:35,550
I PICKED PEOPLE THAT OBVIOUSLY

1176
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,677
EVERYONE ELSE DIDN'T AGREE WITH.

1177
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,845
Jeff: CHELSEA, DO YOU BUY

1178
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,680
THAT KAT IS 22 AND NAIVE OR IS

1179
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,557
THAT A GREAT STRATEGY?

1180
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,391
IT'S, LIKE, THAT'S HER WAY

1181
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,768
OUT EVERY TIME SHE SCREWS UP.

1182
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:46,477
EVERY TIME SOMEONE GETS ON HER

1183
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,938
CASE ABOUT HOW SELFISH SHE IS

1184
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,190
SHE SAYS "YEAH, I'M 22, GET OFF

1185
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:51,899
MY BACK.

1186
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,234
IT'S LIKE IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN

1187
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,404
TO HER AGE AND 22 IS NOT THAT

1188
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,071
YOUNG.

1189
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,239
IS THIS WHOLE TRIBAL COUNCIL

1190
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:58,906
ABOUT ME?

1191
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,701
LIKE, I HAD NO IDEA THIS IS...

1192
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:05,580
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

1193
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,081
Jeff: TARZAN, YOU'RE AN

1194
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,708
OLDER MAN WHO'S HAD LIFE

1195
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,417
EXPERIENCE.

1196
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,251
WHERE DO YOU WEIGH IN ON THIS?

1197
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,252
I KNOW SHE WANTED TO HAVE FUN

1198
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,461
WITH THE GIRLS.

1199
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,380
I'M AN OLD MAN.

1200
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,631
SHE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT MY

1201
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,258
CIRCUMSTANCE OR ABOUT MY WIFE.

1202
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,259
SHE'S 22.

1203
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,427
AND SO THINGS LIKE THIS DON'T

1204
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,761
HIT HER YET BECAUSE SHE'S TOO

1205
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,972
YOUNG TO HAVE EXPERIENCED ENOUGH

1206
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:23,764
THINGS IN LIFE.

1207
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,685
SO IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL.

1208
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,519
Jeff: ALICIA, LET'S TALK

1209
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,230
ABOUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE FOR

1210
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:31,772
IMMUNITY.

1211
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,440
SABRINA'S FIRST OUT.

1212
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,984
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME IS

1213
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,611
THAT GOOD NEWS THAT SHE'S OUT

1214
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,446
EARLY AND NOT SEEN AS THE A

1215
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,155
THREAT?

1216
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,740
IS IT BAD NEWS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

1217
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,449
HANG IN THERE, MAN, YOU DON'T

1218
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,492
DESERVE TO GO TO THE END.

1219
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,119
I WAS SURPRISED SABRINA GOT

1220
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:45,786
OUT FIRST.

1221
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,455
MY VOTE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR

1222
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:47,997
TARZAN, YOU KNOW?

1223
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,623
(LAUGHS)

1224
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,916
I'M SORRY.

1225
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:55,671
MAYBE IT'S HER GAME TO NOT SHOW
HERSELF AS A PHYSICAL THREAT.

1226
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,547
Jeff: GO TO THE OTHER END.

1227
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,257
KAT AND KIM DUKE IT OUT TO THE

1228
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,467
END.

1229
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,593
I EXPECT THAT FROM KIM, SHE

1230
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,595
BRINGS IT.

1231
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,804
CAT I WAS VERY SHOCKED.

1232
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,140
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE HAD IT IN

1233
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:08,142
HER.

1234
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:08,976
Jeff: DOES KAT EARN RESPECT

1235
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,936
FOR HANGING IN THE CHALLENGE

1236
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:10,519
THAT LONG?

1237
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,941
DEFINITELY.

1238
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,275
HOWEVER I WAS A LITTLE BAFFLED

1239
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,985
HOW SHE REACTED BECAUSE SHE WAS

1240
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,569
SO UPSET WITH KIM.

1241
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,988
Jeff: I WASN'T UPSET WITH

1242
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,156
KIM, I WAS UPSET WITH MYSELF

1243
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,783
THAT MY BAD I DO GAVE OUT.

1244
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,284
KIM WENT TO GIVE YOU A HIGH

1245
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,994
FIVE AND YOU KIND OF SNUFFED

1246
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:27,536
HERE.

1247
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,163
DUDE, WHAT IS THIS?

1248
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,498
Jeff: SABRINA, WHAT'S THE

1249
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,332
VIBE AROUND CAMP?

1250
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,210
YOU PRETTY MUCH DECIMATED THE

1251
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:34,919
GUYS.

1252
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,087
NOW WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO IT.

1253
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,631
IT'S GETTING A LITTLE TESTY.

1254
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,383
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I

1255
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,550
APPRECIATE HONESTY.

1256
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,553
TO ME THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE GET

1257
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,179
RESPECT.

1258
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,223
Jeff: KIM, DO YOU THINK

1259
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:47,890
BEING TOO HONEST IF YOU GET TO

1260
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,184
THE END CAN BE AN ASSET AND

1261
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,060
THEREFORE MAKE YOU A THREAT?

1262
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:51,852
YEAH.

1263
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,980
I MEAN, TO ME IT'S BAD NEWS.

1264
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,189
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WIN THIS GAME

1265
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,190
THAT SHOOT STRAIGHT AND

1266
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:57,984
EVERYBODY LOVES THEM AND IT'S

1267
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,068
LIKE AN ENDEARING QUALITY IN

1268
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,737
THIS GAME WHICH ALSO MAKES ME

1269
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,363
NERVOUS.

1270
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,322
Jeff: SABRINA, WORRIED AT

1271
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,740
ALL THAT YOU MAY NOT GET TO THE

1272
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,200
END BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK "SHE IS

1273
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,410
TOO WELL SPOKEN AND SHE HASN'T

1274
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,035
LIED?"

1275
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,870
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PEOPLE

1276
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,538
VALUE.

1277
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,039
LIKE, TO BE HONEST, I WILL GO

1278
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,000
STRAIGHT UP MY EMOTIONS.

1279
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,376
SO THE PERSON THAT MAY HAVE

1280
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,211
PISSED ME OFF, THEY DON'T GET MY

1281
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,587
VOTE AND THEY COULD BE THE BEST

1282
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,881
PLAYER IN THIS GAME.

1283
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,217
Jeff: SO, KAT, SABRINA VERY

1284
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,926
BLACK-AND-WHITE IS SAYING

1285
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,553
LISTEN, IF I END UP ON THE JURY,

1286
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,430
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW

1287
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,056
YOU MAY NOT LIKE HOW I VOTE

1288
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,724
BECAUSE I MAY JUST BE IN A BAD

1289
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,351
MOOD SO IF YOU BLIND SIDE ME,

1290
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,227
HELLO, WATCH OUT.

1291
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,395
UM, IF IT IS GOING TO BE A

1292
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,231
BLIND SIDE, IT'S GOING TO BE

1293
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,899
PRETTY FUNNY AND PRETTY, LIKE,

1294
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,567
EXCITING.

1295
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,401
Jeff: WHY WOULD BIT FUN AND

1296
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:40,860
EXCITING?

1297
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:41,610
I DON'T KNOW.

1298
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,612
BECAUSE BLIND SIDES ARE ALWAYS

1299
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,114
FUN AND EXCITING.

1300
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,282
YOU'RE LIKE... YOU KNOW?

1301
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,242
I ALWAYS GET EXCITED IF

1302
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:48,909
SOMETHING LIKE THAT GOES DOWN

1303
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,704
AND IF IT DOES, COOL BEANS.

1304
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,914
IF IT DOESN'T, TOUCHE.

1305
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,790
WHATEVER.

1306
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,044
(LAUGHS)

1307

IT'S TIME TO GET TO THE VOTE.

1309
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:01,756
KIM HAS IMMUNITY.

1310
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,632
YOU CAN NOT VOTE FOR KIM.

1311
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,259
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:36,290
BUT IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1316
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,666
KAT, YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT UNTAMED

1317
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,959
TO TAKE TO THE TOP.

1318
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:39,668
I'M SURE YOU'LL LEARN THIS LIFE

1319
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,546

HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

1324
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:06,821

KAT'S REACTION, THAT WAS A BIG

1349
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,896

STANDING IS LOSING IT.

1361
