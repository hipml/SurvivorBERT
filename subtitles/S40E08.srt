that first night,

nobody to kind of give you a hug

I try to find humor
in everything,

72
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,505
but it's not always because
it's humorous.

73
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,174
It's...

74
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,383
(voice breaking):
maybe a mask or a wall.

75
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,136

Is maybe the reason

76
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:44,265
you're feeling the emotion
connected to Extinction?

77
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,934
Yeah, I think so.

78
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,936
And when you look at the mast--

79
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,480
and I have two little daughters
at home-- and I think

80
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,442
giving up the pursuit
of a cash prize for your family

81
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,944
is maybe even more paramount

82
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,320
than sticking it out
for a cash prize.

83
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,824

struggle I'm having.

on an island.

this beautiful family.

once again,

if you set aside the game--

all these people

That wasn't there yesterday.

691
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,098
That was definitely
not there yesterday.

692
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,392
Yes, it was.

693
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,228
<i>SOPHIE:</i>
<i>My sense of what's happening</i>

694
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,064
is that a bunch
of the "big guys,"

695
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:20,235
<i>Jeremy, Tony, Tyson and Ben,</i>
<i>all got together and said,</i>

696
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,110
"Maybe Wendell, maybe Nick."

697
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,030
<i>But a lot of power</i>
<i>in this tribe</i>

698
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,032
<i>is coming from Jeremy,</i>

699
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,909
and I think
Wendell is Jeremy's man.

700
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,911
-I'm down for Wendell.
-Okay. Okay.

701
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,579
-Okay.
-Kind of don't mind
cutting Jeremy

702
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,665
-off at the knees
a little bit, you know?
-Oh, really?

703
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,082
I don't know.

704
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,126

aren't they?

<i>I don't know, man.</i>
<i>See, that's what I don't know.</i>

706
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,051
So it's shifting to Wendell now?
Not...?

707
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,637
But can we get Jeremy
to go along with that?

708
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,307
It's like...

709
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,183
So, the group
is wanting Wendell.

710
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,310
I'll just come out and say it.

711
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,604
I know. I know. I know.

712
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,690
And I knew you weren't
gonna be happy about it.

713
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,401
Like, if Wendell's here,
he's another shield for us.

714
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,612
-That's our thing.
-I know. It is our thing.

715

it's a bad decision.

-I do.

And that's why...

722
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,750

-It's Adam.

<i>So, as long as Wendell's safe,</i>

729
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,263

-Yeah.

734
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,106
If you're that adamant...
Listen, I don't want

735
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,816
Wendell to go, either,
and if we want

736
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:44,110
to change it,
it's gonna be a lot of work.

737
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,822

it's the right move.

-SARAH: Wendell.

739
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,869
I mean, I'll change
the last minute if we have to.

740
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,330
-My trust level

-KIM: Yeah. Same.

741
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,165

Adam, is it as tricky
as literally walking

854
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,101
past somebody
as you're gathering wood,

855
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,769
going, "Plan 'A'"?

856
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,897
Yeah, absolutely.
Some of the conversations

857
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,608
that I've had here
have been like... that.

858
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,610
They happen,
and then they're over,

859
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,737
and you don't even know if you
just had a conversation or not.

860
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,949
And I'm the type of person
that wants to have

861
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,534
that conversation
with everybody.

862
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,620
PROBST:
Nick, is there a risk

863
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,290
that you can go back too many
times to say, "Are we sure"?

864
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,833
And at some point,
people might just say,

865
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,960
"Hey, you know what?
Let's just make it him.

866
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,629
-Keeps asking if we're sure."
-It's tough

867
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,964
because I want
to double-check, too.

868
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,591
I mean, that's the way
I've always played.

869
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,425
But, yeah,
you don't want to look like

870
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,761
the guy that's paranoid
or the guy

871
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:02,470
that's questioning
all your allies.

872
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,972
SOPHIE:
You know, Jeff,

873
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,600
I feel like the hardest thing
on<i> Survivor</i> is

874
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,435
being okay not being
in every conversation,

875
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,520
being a little bit
out of the loop.

876
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,481
I mean, in my head,
I turn into a 12-year-old girl

877
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,441
in high school who wants
to follow every single group.

878
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,027
But instead, I have to prove

879
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,196
to people who are
in my alliance, in those groups,

880
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,322
that I trust them
and that I don't

881
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,448
have to be
in every conversation.

882
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,367
PROBST:
So, Sarah,

883
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,953
if it's impossible to have
a conversation with everybody,

884
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,663
how fast can you tell
if a name's

885
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,831
gathering steam,
getting traction?

886
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,833
It takes a while to figure out

887
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,502
if that name
is actually the name.

888
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,631
Like, in past seasons,
you would see the punch coming.

889
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,967
This season,
people are gonna get sniped.

890
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,010
Everybody's holding
their cards so close.

891
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,680
Nobody really believes that name

892
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,599
even up until the last
few minutes we're at camp.

893
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,851
PROBST:
So, Jeremy, that sounds

894
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,812
like people don't want
to throw the name out,

895
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,480
but they'll gladly listen
to a name.

896
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,692
Jeff, we're all playing a
little sparring match right now.

897
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,068
We're testing people out.

898
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,112
We don't want to give them
the whole thing yet,

899
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,863
so we're just getting our reach.

900
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,365
PROBST:
And yet, Adam, somehow,

901
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,868
moves get made,
blindside after blindside.

902
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,871
I... I'm still not sure
how-how things

903
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,708
may or may not have-have
come together tonight.

904
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,836
I mean, people did not
want to talk.

905
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,504
Tony, with the cagey level
of gameplay,

906
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,842
is the easy thing just to say,
"As long as it's not me"?

907
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,012
Well, that-that's how I think
we're all looking at it.

908
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:26,929
Like, this is a body
of water right here.

909
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,389
This is the ocean,
and you just got to stay

910
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,058
with the flow,
and if you want to swim

911
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,227

putting yourself in danger.

912
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,062

913
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,606

to go with the current.
