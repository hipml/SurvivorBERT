>> YOU WANT SOME FISH?

15
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,943
IT'S NOT A CHARITY NOW.

>> AFTER JON LEFT, I SAW SUCH A

17
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,821
DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THEY

18
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,655
TREATED ME.

19
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,824
>> Jeff: AT EXILE ISLAND, JON

00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,660
FOUND A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

21
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,202

36
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,598
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH

37
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:56,806

38
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,348

00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,946
JOSH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,356
>> I'M FURIOUS THAT JOSH IS

49
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:46,523

ABOUT ME NOW.

58
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,037
SO I NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

59
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,289
MOVEED FOR BEING IN THE

60
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,083
MINORITY.

61
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,223
>> I KNOW, BUT THAT'S PART OF

62
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:20,390
IT.

63
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:20,890
THAT'S PART OF THE GAME.

64
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,684
GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

65
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,226
>> THE BROTHER I NEVER HAD.

00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,228
>> THE THING THAT REALLY PUSHED

67
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,397
ME OVER THE EDGE TO JOIN THE

68
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,483
ALLIANCE WITH JEREMY, WAS WHEN

69
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,902
JACLYN FELT LIKE SHE WAS BEING

70
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,611
DISRESPECTED BY EVERYBODY IN THE

71
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,654
JOSH AND REED ALLIANCE.

72
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,406
I WASN'T SURE WHY, BUT MY

73
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:36,990
INSTINCTS WERE TELLING ME THAT

74
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,575
WAS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

75
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,034
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I GOT

76
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:40,285
YOUR BACK.

77
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,703
>> IF THERE'S ANYTHING I LEARNED

78
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,289
FROM WATCHING PAST "SURVIVOR,"

79
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,374
IT'S TRUST YOUR INSTINCT.

80
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,836
>> YOU TWO JUMPED SHIP QUICK.

81
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,421
JOSH HAS BEEN LYING TO ME FOR 15

82
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:51,588
DAYS.

83
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,298

>> MISSY HAS BEEN LYING TO ME 17

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:57,886

86
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,429
IT DIDN'T GO OUR WAY TONIGHT.

87
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,972
JON AND JACLYN FLIPPED OVER

88
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,181
THERE AGAIN WITH THEM, AND WE'RE

89
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,266
IN A BAD PLACE.

90
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,351
THEY CAN PICK US OFF ONE AT A

91
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:05,560
TIME.

92
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,603
AS SOON AS YOU STEP BACK HERE

93
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,187
THE COUPLES DEAL WAS OVER

94
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:08,771
BECAUSE THAT DIDN'T LAST LONG

95
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,898
WITH YOU.

96
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,232
REMEMBER THE WORD "COUPLES?

97

>> MY SON IS MY COUPLE.

100
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,780
I HAVE THE IDOL.

101
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,032
THE THING ABOUT THAT IS PLAYING

102
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,450
IT AT THE RIGHT TIME, TO MAYBE

103
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,409
GET ONE OF THEM OIT.

104
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,744

105
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,287
IT ON ME WHEN IT'S REALLY ABOUT

106
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:24,454
YOU.

107
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,580

108
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,164
AFTER THE MERGE.

109
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,874
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL THAT.

110
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,167
MAYBE I CAN TELL THEM TO VOTE ME

111
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,335
OFF, THEY ALL PUT MY NAME DOWN,

112
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,379

WITH JON.

114
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,341
I'VE HAD IT WITH MISSY.

115
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,760
THAT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA.

116
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,347

00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,259
TEAM AND SWITCH?

381
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,343
>> Jeff:YOU CAN GIVE IT TO

382
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,136
WHOEVER YOU WANT TO.

383
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,387
>> I WANT TO GIVE MY POSITION UP

384
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:01,971
FOR JON.

385
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,514
>> Jeff: SWITCH.

386
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,140
>> I WANT TO GIVE MY POSITION

387
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,306
UP.

388
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,724
>> Jeff: TO WHO?

389
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,267
>> TO JACK.

390
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,269
>> ARE YOU GUYS KIDDING ME.

391
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,270
>> MY GOSH!

392
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:09,979
>> Jeff: JACLYN, COME ON OVER.

393
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,981
JON, COME ON OVER.

394
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:12,940
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, JEREMY.

395
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,192
>> Jeff: WOW!

396
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,235
CRAZY TRADE!

397
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,653
>> OH, MY GOSH.

398
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,028
I'M GOING TO CRY.

399
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:22,116
>> I'M, LIKE, HOLDING BACK TEARS

400
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:22,366
RIGHT NOW.

401
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,492
>> I KNOW.

402
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,827

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,413
SPOT OVER HERE ON THE WINNING

404
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:27,955
TEAM'S PLATFORM.

405
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:28,581
JOIN THE WINNERS.

406
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,834
>> I LOVE YOU GUYS!

407
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,335
>> Jeff: NATALIE, EXPLAIN THIS

408
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,587
TO ME.

409
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,796
THAT'S A MASSIVE TRADE ON DAY 22

410
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,842
WHEN FOOD IS SO HARD TO COME BY.

411
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,926
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, I WAS

412
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,887
REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT WAS

413
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,180
GOING TO GO DOWN, AND WHEN

414
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,139
SOMEBODY SHOWS YOU THAT THEY'RE

415
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,684
LOYAL TO YOU, I FEEL LIKE THE

416
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,268
ONLY THING TO DO IS SHOW BACK

417
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,936
SOME LOVE AND RESPECT.

418
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,980
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

419
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,482
>> Jeff: NATALIE AND JEREMY,

420
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,484
IN GIVING UP YOUR SPOT, BEFORE

421
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,568
DECIDING ON EXILE, YOU ALSO GAVE

422
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,194
THE POWER TO DECIDE WHO IS GOING

423
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,528
TO EXILE.

424
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,363
IT CAN BE ANYBODY IN THIS GAME.

425
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,909
BUT YOU FIVE HAVE TO DECIDE.

426
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,244
>> WE'RE GOING TO CHOOSE JEREMY.

427
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,580
>> Jeff: JEREMY'S GOING TO

428
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:09,788
EXILE.

429
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,331
YOU GO WITH NA?

430
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,333
>> I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

431
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:12,958
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JEREMY,

432
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,418
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

433
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,920
>> JEREMY, THANK YOU SO MUCH,

434
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,296
DUDE.

435
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:17,880
>> Jeff: I CAN'T REMEMBER WILL

436
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,048
RETURN IN TIME FOR THE NEXT

437
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,926
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

438
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:22,885
TWO MINUTES AGO HE WAS ON A

439
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,720
YACHT.

440
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,432
BAYLOR, ALEC, REED, JON, JACLYN,

441
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,017
NICE AFTERNOON.

442
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,893
ENJOY IT.

443
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,227
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

444
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,019
HEAD DOWN TO THE BEACH.

445
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,063
THE BOAT WILL PICK YOU UP.

446
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,147
>> LOVE YOU GUYS.

447
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:35,439
>> HAVE FUN.

448
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,942
>> Jeff: KEITH, WES, MISSY,

449
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,985
NATALIE, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

450
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,778
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

451
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,946
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

452
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,156
>> WE CHOSE JEREMY TO GO TO

453
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,159
EXILE JUST BECAUSE I'M POSITIVE

454
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,869
THAT THERE IS AN IDOL ON EXILE,

455
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,579
AND IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR OUR

456
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,164
ALLIANCE TO FIND IT.

457
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,727
>> OH, MY GOSH.

458
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,896
WE ENDED UP GETTING THE "W" BUT

459
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,982
I DECIDED I WOULD GIVE UP MY

460
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,192
SPOT TO JON.

461
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:20,609
>> JON NEEDS FOOD.

462
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,694
>> LET'S DO IT.

463
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,028
>> I JUST WANTED TO DO THIS SO

464
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,989
HE KNEW I APPRECIATED HIM SIDING

465
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,533
WITH US LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL.

466
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,368
BUT ALSO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT

467
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,412
MOVINGED FOR, I COULD ALWAYS

468
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,122
COUNT ON JACLYN AND JON TO TRUST

469
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:33,914
ME AND JEREMY AND, YOU KNOW,

470
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,749
THIS IS GOING TO BE LEVERAGE FOR

471
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,336
ME DOWN THE ROAD.

472
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,337
>> HE WAS ALMOST CRYING.

473
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,130
>> HE WAS.

474
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,091
>> HIM AND JACLYN BOTH.

475
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,593
>> NATALIE AND JEREMY TRADED

476
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,094
PLACES FOR THE REWARD WAS A

477
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,095
BIG-TIME STRATEGIC MOVE.

478
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,014
I MEAN, JON AND JACKIE AIN'T

479
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,933
GOING TO FLIP NOW.

480
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,645
I CONGRATULATE HER FOR IT.

481
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,315
TOUCHE FOR THEM.

482
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,692
>> IF ME OR HE IS GOING HOME,

483
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,319
LET US KNOW.

484
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,154
I DON'T WANT TO GET BLIND SIDED.

485
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,865
>> I WANT TO SEND REED NEXT.

486
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,326
>> I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET

487
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,452
HASHTAG BLINDSIDED.

488
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,911
>> WESLEY WAS LETTING NAT KNOW

489
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,955
THAT HE DEPARTMENT WANT TO BE

490
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,289
BLINDDECIDED.

491
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:19,168
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TOOK THAT

492
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:19,335
HINT.

493
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,211
IT WAS A SMALL HINT, REALLY.

494
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,212
ALL RIGHT, I'M OVER IT.

495
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:22,504
>> ME, TOO.

496
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,505
>> ARE YOU?

497
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,340
>> YEAH.

498
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,090
>> THAT WAY WE GET A LITTLE

499
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,885
HEADS UP ON PLAYING THE IDOL OR

500
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:38,312
PASSING THE IDOL BETWEEN US TWO.

501
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,109
>> JON AND JACLYN JOINED OUR

502
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,819
ALLIANCE, AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

503
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,864
SO GIVING UP OUR REWARD FOR

504
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,199
THEM, IT'S THE LEAST THAT I

505
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,367
COULD DO.

506
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,535
"THE PATH TO VICTORY IS A ROCKY

507
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:53,911
ONE.

508
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,954
IT'S HARD CLIMBING THE LADDER OF

509
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,289
SUCCESS, BUT WITH IMMUNITY IN

510
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,042
YOUR POCKET, YOU MIGHT FEEL A

511
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,794
BIT LESS STRESS."

512
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,087
I CAME TO EXILE BECAUSE I WANT

513
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,215
TO FIND THE IDOL SO I CAN

514
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:06,799
PROTECT MYSELF AND I CAN BRING

515
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,801
IT BACK TO MY ALLIANCE AND SAY

516
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,968
LOOK WHAT WE HAVE.

517
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,429
AND THEN NOW EVERYBODY FEELS

518
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,639
LIKE WE CAN TRUST HIM.

519
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,225
SO WHEN I MAKE A MOVE, THEY

520
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,935
DON'T EXPECT IT.

521
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,978
BUT AT FIRST, I NEED TO FIND

522
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:20,688
THIS IDOL.

523
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,271
THAT LOOKS LIKE THE YACHT THAT

524
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,400
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ON RIGHT NOW.

525
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,070
EATING SANDWICHES AND DRINKING

526
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,614
BEER.

527
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,491
>> LOOK AT THAT!

528
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,868
>> GUYS, LOOK AT THE DOLPHIN!

529
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,620
<i>( CHEERS )</i>

530
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,247
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT!

531
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,206
>> THERE THEY ARE!

532
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:43,001
>> GOING ON A YACHT, SEEING

533
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,378
DOLPHINS JUMP IN, IT WAS REALLY

534
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:44,586
COOL.

535
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,170
BEING ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH

536
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,339
JACLYN WAS INCREDIBLE.

537
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,007
>> THESE CHIPS AAMAZING.

538
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,466
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

539
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,217
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

540
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,469
>> IT WAS A GOOD WAY FOR JEREMY

541
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,263
AND NATALIE TO SHOW THEIR

542
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:54,513
GRATITUDE.

543
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,266
WE WERE VERY THANKFUL FOR IT.

544
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,308
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO REALIZE THIS

545
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,102
IS A SOCIAL GAME, AND THAT WAS A

546
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,604
VERY BIG PLAY ON THEIR PART.

547
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,733
TO THE BEST TEAM "SURVIVOR'S"

548
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,025
EVER SEEN.

549
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,276
CHEERS!

550
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,653
>> I LOVE FOOD AND I LOVE

551
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,863
REWARDS BUT JON AND JACLYN WERE

552
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,322
NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE

553
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:12,573
REWARD.

554
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,241
>> THANK YOU, JEREMY AND

555
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:14,450
NATALIE!

556
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,368
>> I KNOW, THANK YOU, JEREMY AND

557
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:16,744
NATALIE.

558
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,746
>> NATALIE IS JUST TRYING TO

559
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,913
INGRAISHATE HERSELF TO EVERYONE

560
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,999
BY "OH, I'M GOING TO GIVE UP MY

561
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:22,875
SPOT FOR THIS.

562
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,668
AND I LOVE YOU, SO I'M GOING TO

563
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,336
GIVE UP MY SPOT FOR THAT."

564
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,588
IT MAKES MEANTIME TO HURL

565
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,130
BECAUSE IT'S SO TRANSPARENT.

566
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,341
YES, IT CEMENTS JON AND JACLYN

567
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,010
IN THE ALLIANCE BUT IN THE END

568
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,554
DOES IT REALLY MEAN ANYTHING?

569
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,723
NOT IF I CAN HELP THAT.

570
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,016
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE

571
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:39,475
RIGHT NOW.

572
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,310
I MAY HAVE TO STIR UP A LITTLE

573
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,936
CHAOS TO STAY IN THE GAME RIGHT

574
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,103
NOW.

575
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,354
IT MAY END UP BEING THE LAST

576
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,190
NAIL IN MY COFFIN BUT IT'S A

577
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,610
RISK I'M WILLING TO TAKE AT THIS

578
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:49,902
POINT.

579
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,666
IT'S JUST A LONG NIGHT.

580
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,959
THERE'S NO SHELTER.

581
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,336
YOU'RE SLEEPING ON ROCKS NEXT TO

582
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:07,961
THE FIRE.

583
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:15,469
IT'S JUST NOT FUN.

584
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,850
I STAYED UP MOST OF THE NIGHT,

585
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,604
AND NOW I'M FEEL REAL LETHARGIC

586
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,230
THIS MORNING, LIKE I GOT HIT BY

587
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,689
A TRAIN.

588
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,857
NOT FUN.

589
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,360
THIS TIME I WANTED TO FIND THE

590
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,236
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AND I

591
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,611
DIDN'T FIND IT.

592
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,571
LET ME GO CHECK THAT OUT ONE

593
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:40,911
MORE TIME.

594
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,996
I CLIMBED THIS ALL DAY

595
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,373
YESTERDAY, AND I CAN'T FIND IT.

596
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,250
THE ONLY THING I'M THINKING IS

597
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,210
JON ALREADY FOUND IT.

598
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,630
IF JON CAME OUT AND FOUND IT,

599
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,422
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

600
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,675
BUT HE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME HE IT

601
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,300
AND THEN I WOULDN'T BE OUT HERE

602
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,886
FOR TWO DAYS YOU KNOW.

603
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,679
I'M DYING OVER HERE.

604
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:05,727
I'M TIRED.

605
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,521
I'M THINKING ABOUT WHEN JEREMY

606
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,188
COMES BACK, HE'S GOING TO

607
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,066
PROBABLY HAVE GOTTEN A MORE

608
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,609
SPECIFIC CLUE.

609
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,404
AND IF IT SAYS, LIKE, ANYTHING

610
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,574
ABOUT IT BEING ON THE ISLAND,

611
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,450
THEN HE KNOWS I FOUND THE IDOL.

612
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,870
>> YEAH.

613
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,538
>> SO EITHER PEOPLE ARE ANYTHING

614
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,542
TO THINK HE'S EXTREMELY STUPID

615
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,418
AND IS TRYING TO PULL OFF THAT

616
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,838
HE COULDN'T FIND IT, OR THEY'RE

617
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,006
GOING TO THINK I WAS LYING THIS

618
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,340
WHOLE TIME.

619
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,510
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHERE

620
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,386
I HADN'T REALLY CONSIDERED

621
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,180
WHAT'S GOINGS TO HAPPEN WHEN

622
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,182
JEREMY DOES COME BACK AND SAYS

623
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,516
HE CAN'T FIND THE IDOL.

624
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,518
THANE HE'S NOT DUMB.

625
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,855
MY ENTIRE COVER WOULD BE BLOWN,

626
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,523
AND THEN I COULD BE IN VERY BIG

627
00:19:51,607 --> 00:20:04,620
TROUBLE.

628
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:15,255
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

629
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,466
WE'LL NOW BRING IN JEREMY,

630
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,008
RETURNING FROM EXILE ISLAND.

631
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:28,393
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

632
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:28,560
WOW.

00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,104
EXILE KICKED YOUR BUTT?

635
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,190
>> IT WAS A TOUGH TWO NIGHTS, A

636
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:33,941
LOT OF BUGS.

637
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,402
THE CRABS WERE REAL SHAKY AND

638
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:37,611
SCARY.

639
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,864
TOUGH TO DO.

640
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,074
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS

641
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,867

JEREMY, TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.

WES HAS HIS PIECES AND THEY GO

683
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:18,712
EVERYWHERE.

684
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,172
IF A PIECE DROPS AT ANY POINT,

685
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,590
YOU CAN PICK IT UP WITH YOUR

686
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,549
HAND TO PUT IT BACK IN THE

706
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,386

00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:43,893

SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

822
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,527
>> ZAPPED ME.

823
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,696
IF I WAS 100%, THAT WOULD MAKE A

824
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:54,988
DIFFERENCE.

825
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,614
I ALWAYS WANT TO WIN, BUT AS

826
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,198
LONG AS ONE OF OUR ALLIANCE

827
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,950
MEMBERS WON, I'M HAPPY HOW IT

828
00:26:59,034 --> 00:26:59,326
TURNED OUT.

829
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,728
I WAS CLOSE TO.

830
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,647
I'M A LITTLE BUMMED ABOUT THAT.

831
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,025
I FELT THAT WAS A CUSTOM-MADE

832
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:32,776
CHANCES FOR ME AND I FEEL MY

833
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,819
CHANCES OF BEING HERE TOMORROW

834
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,195
ARE PRETTY SLIM.

835
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,031
I MAY BE GOING HOME TONIGHT SO I

836
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,616
MAY LIGHT THIS CAMP ON FIRE ON

837
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,827
MY WAY OUT.

838
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,581
SO I WAS, LIKE, I WANT TO SEE

839
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,375
WHAT KEITH HAS IN HIS BACK BAG.

840
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:53,421
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THIS OLD COOT

841
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,841
IS SITTING ON.

842
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,219
SO I'M GOING THROUGH HIS BAG,

843
00:27:59,302 --> 00:27:59,886
AND I'M LOOKING AND HE'S GOT THE

844
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,639
PIECE OF PAPER THAT WAS FOLDED

845
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,598
UP AND CREASED OVER THERE.

846
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,557
IT IS THE DIRECTIONS ON WHAT TO

847
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:09,270
DO WITH THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

848
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:09,479
IDOL.

849
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,438
KEITH LEFT A PAPER TRAIL.

850
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,773
AND I WAS LIKE IT'S A BIG ROOKIE

851
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,857
MISTAKE.

852
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,733
DON'T LEAVE STUFF IN YOUR BAG

853
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,859
THAT YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO

854
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,068
FIND.

855
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,070
SO I DID IT.

856
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:17,862
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT I HATE WHEN

857
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,532
PEOPLE GO THROUGH PEOPLE'S STUFF

858
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,908
BUT DESPERATE TIMES CALL FOR

859
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:22,826
DESPERATE MEASURES.

860
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,579
SO HERE'S THE THING, I KIND OF

861
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,456
STUMBLED ACROSS SOMETHING TODAY

862
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,708
THAT WASN'T-- IT WAS KIND OF

863
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,000
FORTUITOUS.

864
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,045
I WENT TO GRAB WHAT I THOUGHT

865
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:34,838
WAS JULIA'S BAG, AND IT WAS

866
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,089
KEITH'S BAG.

867
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,883
AND IT HAD THE CLUE TO THE

868
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:39,926
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IN IT.

869
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,429
IT'S THE NOTE THAT SAYS, "THIS

870
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,681
IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL."

871
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,348
>> SERIOUSLY.

872
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,225
ON A PIECE OF PAPER.

873
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,477
>> "IMMUNITY IDOL RULES."

874
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,353
>> OH, MY GOD.

875
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,813
>> THAT MEANS WE KNOW WHERE THE

876
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,730
IDOL IS.

877
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,148
KEITH HAS IT.

878
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,483
>> I KNOW REED'S SCRAMBLING, BUT

879
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,025
IF KEITH REALLY HAS AN IDOL,

880
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,944
IT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL.

881
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,279
QUITE FRANKLY, IT MAY BE

882
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,405
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD THINK

883
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:00,613
ABOUT.

884
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,573
>> YOU GUYS STILL HAVE THE

885
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,866
NUMBERS AND THEN ME, BECAUSE I'M

886
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,324
VOTING WITH YOU GUYS.

887
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,869
SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT

888
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:06,077
THERE.

889
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,871
>> KEITH HAS AN IDOL?

890
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,746
>> YEAH.

891
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,664
>> WHEN IS THAT?

892
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:10,874
WHEN DID HE FIND IT?

893
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,835
IF WHAT REED SAYS IS TRUE,

894
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,170
FREAKING KEITH, OUT OF ALL

895
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,380
PEOPLE, HAS AN IDOL, WHICH IS

896
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:17,672
BAFFLING.

897
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,215
I WOULD NEVER THINK KEITH WOULD

898
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:19,799
BE THE ONE TO FIND IT.

899
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,594
AND BE ABLE TO HIDE IT THIS

900
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,094
LONG.

901
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,471
WHONS HOW LONG HE'S HAD IT?

902
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:30,852
SO IT'S ABOUT TO GET CRAZY.

903
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,604
>> SOMEBODY BROKE INTO MY BAG.

904
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,272
I'VE GOT THE IDOL, BUT NOW

905
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,982
EVERYBODY KNOWS I HAVE THE IDOL.

906
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,317
THE CLUE AND EVERYTHING WAS

907
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,693
WRAPPED UP WITH THE IDOL.

908
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:42,280
THE IDOL WAS IN MY BLUE JEANS

909
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:42,489
PANTS.

910
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,073
THE CLUES AND EVERYTHING WAS IN

911
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:44,407
THAT BLUE BAG.

912
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,368
AND IT'S NOW GONE.

913
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,538
>> THERE'S A THIEF OUT HERE

914
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:50,788
SOMEWHERE.

915
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,372
>> I MEAN, THAT'S MY STUFF.

916
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,916
I DON'T LIKE-- I DON'T GO

917
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,666
THROUGH YOUR STUFF.

918
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,209
I DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO GO

919
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,877
THROUGH MY STUFF, BUT DIFFERENT

920
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,505
PEOPLE GOT DIFFERENT VALUES, I

921
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:58,713
GUESS.

922
00:29:58,796 --> 00:29:59,923
WE'RE UP-- WE'RE UP A CREEK.

923
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,800
SO WORD MIGHT BE OUT THAT

924
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,637
KEITH'S GOT THE IDOL, AND IT

925
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,722
MIGHT COME IN PLAY SOONER THAN

926
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:07,931
LATER.

927
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,642
>> KEITH HAS AN IDOL REED FOUND

928
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:10,808
IT.

929
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,059
>> WHAT?

930
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:11,851
>> IN HIS BAG.

931
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,228
HE FOUND THE PAPERS THAT SAYS,

932
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,729
"THIS IS AN IDOL."

933
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:15,939
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH YOURS?

934
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,482
>> I BURNED THEM.

935
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,608
>> THEY'RE DEFINITELY HIS AND HE

936
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:18,858
HAS ONE.

937
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,152
>> A LOT GOING ON.

938
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,196
TOTAL MAYHEM NOW AT CAMP.

939
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,989
KEITH HAS AN IDOL, SO HE'S GOT A

940
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,325
VERY GOOD PLAY IN HIS POCKET.

941
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:27,909
DEFINITELY COMPLICATES THINGS.

942
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,579
>> I'M TELLING YOU, JON GOT THAT

943
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:31,746
IDOL.

944
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:32,372
I'M TELLING YOU.

945
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,374
NAT, I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

946
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,041
HE DEFINITELY HAS IT.

947
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,377
>> JON IS TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL

948
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:37,710
OF EVERYTHING.

949
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,337
>> YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST

950
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,380
HERE,UN WHAT I MEAN?

951
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,632
>> YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I 100%

952
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:42,840
TRUST.

953
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,592
>> DON'T TRUST NOBODY ELSE.

954
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,553
JON IS TRYING TO SET IT UP RIGHT

955
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:46,719
NOW.

956
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,971
I THINK JON HAS THE IDOL SO MY

957
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,138
PLAN IS I WANT TO TRY TO CATCH

958
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:49,931
HIM IN A LIE BECAUSE JON'S,

959
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,976
LIKE, THE WORST LIAR.

960
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,519
>> THIS IS THE CLUE.

961
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,937
I WANT YOU TO READ IT.

962
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,564
AND YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU THINK

963
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,607
IT WOULD BE ON EXILE.

964
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,525
>> ON THE ISLAND, RIGHT?

965
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,403
>> I WENT UP BOTH OF THEM.

966
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:03,611
DIGGING.

967
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,612
NOTHING THERE.

968
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,989
SO THAT'S WHY I'M, LIKE, JON HAD

969
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,492
TO HAVE FOUND IT.

970
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,035
BECAUSE I'M, LIKE, " WHY O, IF

971
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,495
YOU FOUND IT, WE DON'T NEED TO

972
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:12,745
GO BACK.

973
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,037
>> I KNOW.

974
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,707
>> WE COULD SEND THEM, AND THEY

975
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,499
COULD DIE OUT THERE.

976
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,125
>> JEREMY, I WOULD--

977
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,379
>> DANG!

978
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,547
HE'S GOT TO BE LYING BUT I HAVE

979
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,089
TO TRUST HIM A LITTLE BIT.

980
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,966
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

981
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,175
WE'RE TRYING TO GO TO THE FINAL

982
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,885
SIX, AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT

983
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:28,136
HAPPENS.

984
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,305
>> SOMEBODY GOT THE IDOL.

985
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,348
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

986
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,225
>> SENDING JEREMY TO EXILE WAS A

987
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,059
GREAT THING AT FIRST, BUT I

988
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,645
THINK RIGHT NOW JEREMY ACTUALLY

989
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,688
DOES BELIEVE THAT I HAVE THE

990
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,981
IDOL AND JUST ISN'T SAYING THAT,

991
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,399
SO I NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND

992
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,360
CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE GAME.

993
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,528
AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT AND

994
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,905
TALKING TO JACLYN, WE BOTH

995
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,906
REALIZED HOW MUCH WE TRUST YOU.

996
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,157
>> OKAY.

997
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,075
>> SO I-- I FOUND THE IDOL.

998
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,619
>> DID YOU?

999
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,411
>> YUP.

1000
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,162
>> TODAY?

1001
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:54,370
>> NO.

1002
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,580
ON EXILE.

1003
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,205
>> YES!

1004
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:56,998
>> I HOPE YOU'RE NOT OFFENDED.

1005
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:01,628
I WOULD LIKE JEREMY OUT THIS

1006
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,211
TIME OR NEXT TIME, BECAUSE I'M

1007
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,005
THINKING IF HE SAYS HE DOESN'T

1008
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:04,881
HAVE THE IDOL--

1009
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,842
>> YOU HE WILL START TELLING

1010
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:08,885
PEOPLE DO YOU AND EVERYONE WILL

1011
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,260
START GETTING--

1012
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:09,510
>> YEAH.

1013
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,136
>> I JUST GOT THIS INFORMATION

1014
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,680
ABOUT THE IDOL, AND I'M VERY

1015
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,223
PLEASED TO KNOW THAT JON IS

1016
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,350
SUPER ALIGNED WITH ME.

1017
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,894
BUT HE'S GOT THIS LOOK IN HIS

1018
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:18,061
EYE.

1019
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,647
JON IS SAYING JEREMY'S A THREAT.

1020
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,064
JEREMY'S A THREAT.

1021
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,441
NOW MAY BE THE TIME TO TAKE OUT

1022
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:23,691
JEREMY.

1023
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,610
I WATCH JON AND JACLYN BARREL

1024
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:26,653
THROUGH PEOPLE SO FAR AND THEY

1025
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,154
HAVE NO PROBLEM PISSING PEOPLE

1026
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,572
OFF, AND SINCE I STARTED THIS

1027
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,740
GAME, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN

1028
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,742
ALIGNED WITH JEREMY AND NATALIE

1029
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,159
FROM MY OLD TRIBE.

1030
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,536
JEREMY AND I INITIALLY WERE

1031
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,079
TOGETHER FULL-FLEDGED.

1032
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:39,624
SO FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT'S,

1033
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,167
LIKE, A LITTLE BIT CLOUDY.

1034
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,752
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S,

1035
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,420
LIKE, OKAY, ARE WE MAKING THE

1036
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,046
RIGHT DECISION?

1037
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,255
I JUST THINK MAYBE A BETTER WAY

1038
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:51,511
TO DO IT IS TRY TO FLUSH THE

1039
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,930
IDOL, TAKE TOGETHER SIX STRONG,

1040
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,098
AND JUST BECAUSE WE ROCK THE

1041
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,516
BOAT TOO HARD, ONE OF US IS

1042
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:12,281
GOING TO FALL OUT.

1043
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,160
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1044
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,872
THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1045
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,082
JOSH, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1046
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:27,422
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1047
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,007
SO, JEREMY, HOW BIG OF A FACTOR

1048
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,676
IS TRUST RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU HAVE

1049
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,260
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A GROUP OF

1050
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,595
SIX VERSUS A GROUP OF FOUR?

1051
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,972
>> MEAN, TRUST IS HUGE.

1052
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,224
IN THIS GAME, IT DOESN'T EVEN

1053
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,684
HAVE TO BE SIX VERSUS FOUR.

1054
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,519
TRUST IS HUGE WITHIN AN

1055
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:41,769
ALLIANCE.

1056
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,437
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN BUILDING

1057
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,354
ALL SEASON.

1058
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,398
AND HOPEFULLY, IT LASTS ALL THE

1059
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,358
WAY TO THE END.

1060
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,609
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU DO TO

1061
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,235
ENSURE THAT IT DOES?

1062
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,946
>> I MEAN, IT'S LITTLE THINGS.

1063
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:53,197
FOR INSTANCE, JACLYN AND JON

1064
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,284
JOINED OUR ALLIANCE.

1065
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,077
AFTER THE REWARD NAT AND MYSELF

1066
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,287
WON WE GAVE DID TO THEM AND

1067
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,874
SAID, LISTEN, YOU GUYS GO ENJOY

1068
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,124
YOURSELF.

1069
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:03,958
THIS IS THE LEAST WE COULD DO

1070
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,460
FOR YOU HAVING TRUSTED US AND

1071
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,002
JOINING US.

1072
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,545
>> Jeff: JACLYN, THAT WAS A

1073
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,255
PRETTY BIG GESTURE TO GIVE UP A

1074
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,089
BIG REWARD TO YOU AND JON.

1075
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,175
DOES THAT COMPLICATE THE GAME?

1076
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,844
>> YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, IT

1077
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,094
DOESN'T.

1078
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,597
IT JUST REASSURED TO ME THAT

1079
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,306
THEY'RE BOTH WITH US, AS MUCH AS

1080
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,891
WE'RE WITH THEM.

1081
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,975
AND THINKING BACK ON THE

1082
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:21,934
DECISION WE MADE, I THINK WE

1083
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,812
MADE THE RIGHT ONE BECAUSE IF WE

1084
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,647
WENT WITH THE OTHER ALLIANCE I'M

1085
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,273
NOT SURE ANYBODY WOULD HAVE DONE

1086
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,442
THAT FOR ME AND JON.

1087
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,401
>> Jeff: JEREMY, THEN AFTER

1088
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,153
WINNING A REWARD, GIVING IT UP,

1089
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,780
YOU GET SENT TO EXILE ISLAND.

1090
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,741
>> DA-DA-DUH!

1091
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,159
>> Jeff: YOU'RE MISTER DPIFG.

1092
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:42,038
>> BUT, JEFF, IT'S NOT EXACTLY

1093
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:42,663
SELFLESS.

1094
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,915
IT DEFINITELY SERVEAISE PURPOSE.

1095
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,041
IT CEMENTS IN TRUST.

1096
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,125
IT'S, "HEY, YOU SCRATCH MY BARK

1097
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,126
I'LL SCRATCH YOURSELF."

1098
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,213
SO IT'S SELF-SERVING IN BEING

1099
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:50,505
SELFLESS.

1100
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:50,713
>> TRUE.

1101
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,965
>> Jeff: WHICH IS ONE OF THE

1102
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:53,591
GREATEST MOVES YOU CAN MAKE THIS

1103
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,884
THIS GAME.

1104
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,635
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1105
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,677
>> Jeff: IT'S A WIN-WIN.

1106
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,138
>> TOTALLY.

1107
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,348
>> Jeff: SO, JEREMY, WHAT WAS

1108
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,099
EXILE LIKE THIS TIME.

1109
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:02,850
>> OH, MAN.

1110
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,018
>> Jeff: BECAUSE YOU WERE OUT

1111
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:04,519
THERE A LONG TIME.

1112
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,228
>> IN THIS GAME I'VE BEEN

1113
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,188
FEELING ALL RIGHT, AND I'LL TELL

1114
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,356
YOU I WAS SPENT.

1115
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,483
SLEEPING ON ROCKS WITH NO

1116
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:10,691
SHELTER.

1117
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,734
IT KICKED MY BUTT.

1118
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,694
I WAS EXHAUSTED WHEN I CAME

1119
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,070
BACK.

1120
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,196
>> Jeff: MISSY, WHEN HE CAME

1121
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,532
BACK, DID YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE

1122
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:17,865
IN THE ENERGY?

1123
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,658
>> OH, YEAH.

1124
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,576
I MEAN, HE USUALLY CRUISES IN

1125
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,244
WITH A HUGE SMILE ON HIS FACE.

1126
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,372
AND TODAY, HE WAS COMPLETELY

1127
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:24,622
FATIGUED.

1128
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,916
HE DEFINITELY LOOKED LIKE HE HAD

1129
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:27,583
BEEN IN A BATTLE.

1130
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,376
IT WAS A DIFFERENT JEREMY.

1131
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,294
>> Jeff: HAS THERE BEEN ANY

1132
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,379
TALK ABOUT IDOLS, MISSY?

1133
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,465
BECAUSE WE'RE ON DAY 24, AND WE

1134
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,343
HAVE NOT HAD AN IDOL PLAYED YET.

1135
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,886
>> THERE'S CERTAINLY SPECULATION

1136
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,470
OF WHO POSSIBLY COULD HAVE IT.

1137
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,264
BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY

1138
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:41,556
COMFORTABLE.

1139
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,306
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU

1140
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,267
SHOULDN'T BE THAT COMFORTABLE IN

1141
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,060
YOUR SKIN THIS ENTIRE GAME.

1142
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:46,853
YOU SHOULDN'T.

1143
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,479
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

1144
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,107
IT CAN SWITCH ON A DIME.

1145
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,649
>> Jeff: JON, DO YOU THINK

1146
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,984
SOMEBODY HERE HAS ONE?

1147
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,277
>> I FEEL EXTREMELY CONFIDENT

1148
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,154
THAT SOMEBODY HERE HAS ONE.

1149
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,447
>> Jeff: WHICH, NATALIE, IF

1150
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,741
ONE OF THOSE FOUR-- REED, KEITH,

1151
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,159
WES, OR ALEC--

1152
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:02,660
ALEC-- HAS AN IDOL, AND

1153
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,453
THEY PLAY IT TONIGHT, THE GAME

1154
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:04,912
COULD FLIP LIKE THAT.

1155
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,205
>> YEAH, IT IS SCARY THAT MAYBE

1156
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,415
THEY HAVE ONE.

1157
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,500
AND, YOU KNOW, IN TURN, IT IS

1158
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,127
KIND OF SCARY ONE OF YOUR

1159
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:11,752
ALLIANCE MEMBERS ARE HIDING ONE

1160
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,838
WITH YOU AS WELL.

1161
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,006
>> CAN I JUST THROW SOMETHING

1162
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,424
OUT THERE?

1163
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,676
SO THE FOUR ON THE OTHER

1164
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,303
ALLIANCE, TWO OF THEM, ALEC AND

1165
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,513
REED, HAVE BEEN REALLY

1166
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,682
FORTHCOMING IN TALKING TO ALL OF

1167
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,392
US, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WES

1168
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,810
AND KEITH HAVEN'T TALKED TO ME

1169
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,228
OR JON ABOUT ANYTHING.

1170
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,230
SO THAT SHOWS ME CONFIDENCE.

1171
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,732
SO IF I WERE TO TAKE A WILD

1172
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,276
GUESS AND SAY WHO HAS AN IDOL, I

1173
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,569
WOULD SAY WES OR KEITH BECAUSE

1174
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,945
THEY'RE NOT REALLY SCRAMBLING.

1175
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,907
>> I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU ABOUT

1176
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,241
STRATEGY THIS WHOLE GAME AT ALL.

1177
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,492
AND YOU HAVEN'T CAME TO ME,

1178
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:43,993
EITHER.

1179
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,368
>> NO.

1180
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:44,994
>> EITHER.

1181
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,662
>> BUT WHEN YOU GUYS WERE TRYING

1182
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,288
TO RECRUIT US TO BE ON YOUR

1183
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,290
SIDE, IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE

1184
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,750
HELPED YOU.

1185
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,793
>> YOU TOLD ME MY LOYALTY WITH

1186
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,170
WAS WITH YOU.

1187
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,213
>> I COME BACK FROM EXILE AND I

1188
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,465
HEAR YOU'RE NOT EVEN TALKING

1189
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:57,632
TO--

1190
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,134
>> AND WHY WOULD WE JOIN YOU

1191
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,970
GUYS WHEN YOU DON'T TAKE

1192
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,512
CONSIDERATION OF HALF OF US.

1193
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,430
>> SHE DIDN'T COME TO ME.

1194
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,642
>> YOU WERE TRYING FOR US.

1195
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,392
WHY SHOULD SHE COME TO YOU.

1196
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,645
COULD YOU PLEASE VOTE WITH US?

1197
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,396
BY THE WAY, WE DON'T CARE ABOUT

1198
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,772
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

1199
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,315
WHEN KEITH IS TALK, HE SAYS JON,

1200
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,442
HE DOESN'T SAY JON AND JACLYN.

1201
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,360
>> WE TRIED EARLY TORE GET THEM

1202
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,488
COME OVER HERE, BUT ONCE JON

1203
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:20,696
DECIDE--

1204
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,489
>> WHY DON'T YOU GUYS TALK TO

1205
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,116
THE GIRLS MORE I THINK IS WHAT

1206
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,617
SHE'S SAYING.

1207
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,369
>> I TALK TO YOUR MOM ALL THE

1208
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:26,577
TIME.

1209
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:26,994
>> HEY!

1210
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:27,453
I'M A GIRL.

1211
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,037
SHE'S A GIRL.

1212
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,955
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1213
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,456
I JUST DON'T GO AROUND TALKING

1214
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,874
TO ALL THE GIRLS, I GUESS TALK

1215
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,460
WHEN I PASS THEM OR SOMETHING.

1216
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,128
>> Jeff: REED, GREAT NEWS FOR

1217
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:36,295
YOU.

1218
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,088
>> YAY!

1219
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,839
>> Jeff: ANY TIME SOMEBODY IS

1220
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,423
YELLING AT SOMEBODY ELSE AT

1221
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:43,552
TRIBAL AND IT'S NOT YOU,

1222
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:43,844
WHOO-HOO.

1223
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,346
>> YOU HAVE THOSE MOMENT WHERE'S

1224
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,764
YOU'RE LIKE KEEP GFIGHT WITH

1225
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,056
EACH OTHER.

1226
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,766
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE

1227
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,309
FROM SECOND TO SECOND, THINGS

1228
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:50,518
CHANGE.

1229
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,353
IF YOU CAN MAKE IT INTO THE NEXT

1230
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,314
SECOND YOU MAY HAVE A WHOLE NEW

1231
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,108
WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF

1232
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:57,274
YOU.

1233
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,776
>> Jeff: JEREMY, SO MUCH OF

1234
00:37:58,859 --> 00:37:59,527
TONIGHT'S CONVERSATION IS

1235
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,319
CENTERED AROUND TIMING.

1236
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,320
WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO MAKE

1237
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,406
THE RIGHT MOVE?

1238
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,031
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK

1239
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,741
ABOUT ALL THE TIME OUT HERE?

1240
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,660
>> WHEN WE KNEW THAT JACLYN AND

1241
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,371
JON WERE ON THE FENCE, I THOUGHT

1242
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,206
TIMING IS EVERYTHING, ESPECIALLY

1243
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,666
WHEN JON WAS AT EXILE.

1244
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,418
I SAID LET ME MAKE SURE THAT

1245
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,212
JACLYN IS ALL RIGHT.

1246
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:21,173
AND PROVE THAT-- I HAVE A WIFE.

1247
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,883
IF SOMEONE TAKES CARE OF MY

1248
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,093
WIFE, LIKE, THAT'S ALL THAT

1249
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:24,510
MATTERS TO ME.

1250
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:28,306
I GOT YOUR BACK.

1251
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,016
>> Jeff: NATALIE, WHAT HAS TO

1252
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:30,558
HAPPEN TONIGHT FOR YOU?

1253
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,727
>> WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN FOR ME IS

1254
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,646
THAT MY ALLIANCE STICKS ON TOWER

1255
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,981
PLAN, AND DON'T LET ANYTHING

1256
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,483
HAPPEN THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BE

1257
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,776
DISTRACTED FROM OUR LONG-TERM

1258
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,444
DPOALZ, ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE

1259
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,196
ARE DESPERATE AND THEY WILL SAY

1260
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,242
ANYTHING TO YOU TO GET WHAT THEY

1261
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:48,409
WANT.

1262
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,663
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1263
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,749
TO VOTE.

1264
00:38:54,832 --> 00:39:00,463
MISSY, YOU'RE UP.

1265
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:10,848
>> HAPPY RETIREMENT, BUDDY.

1266
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,879
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1267
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:51,222
VOTE.

1268
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,224
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1269
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:53,808
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1270
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,309
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1271
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,688
TO DO SO.

1272
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,652
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1273
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,653
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1274
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,779
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1275
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:07,780
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1276
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,614
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1277
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:12,034
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

1295
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:06,380
JEREMY.

1296
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:12,928
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1297
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,689
>> Jeff: JEREMY, THE TRIBE HAS

1298
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,609
SPOKEN.

1299
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:30,112
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1300
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,667
TONIGHT'S VOTE IS BOTH A BRUTAL

1301
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,754
AND BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF WHY YOU

1302
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,758
SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP.

1303
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,175
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

1304
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,344
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:53,928

1311
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:21,622
>> YEAH.

1312
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,957
>> Jeff: WITH JEREMY GONE,

1313
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,333
NATALIE IS OUT FOR REVENGE.

>> I WANT TO GIVE JON A TASTE OF

1315
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,210
HIS OWN MEDICINE.

00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,879
>> AND JON BECOMES PUBLIC ENEMY

1317
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:29,380
NUMBER ONE.

1318
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,673
>> SOMEBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE.

1319
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,590
>> HE'S GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1320
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,592

1321
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:33,968
>> I'M 100% DOWN.

1323
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,597
GAME.

00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,473
>> THEY GOT ME.

1325
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,225
THEY PULLED A FAST ONE ON ME.

1326
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,310
I DID NOT SEE THAT ONE COMING AT

1327
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:43,477
ALL.

1328
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,396
I WAS SO FORTHCOMING WITH

1329
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:45,980
EVERYTHING WITH MY ALLIANCE.

1330
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,899
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL SET.

1331
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,359
IF I KNEW WE WERE GOING TO GO

1332
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:50,985
LOBBY THIS, I WOULD HAVE TAKEN

1333
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,569
THAT LAST AWARD.

1334
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,488
I DON'T HAVE AN ALLIANCE,

1335
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:54,738
OBVIOUSLY.

1336
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,572
I'M JUST SHOCKED.

1337
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,073
THAT'S ALL.

1338
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:56,949
TOO BAD.

1339
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:57,950
GOOD GUY LOST THIS TIME.
