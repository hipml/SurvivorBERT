00:00:02,517 --> 00:00:04,896
Welcome to Survivor45.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,310
[cheering and whooping]

00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,482
PROBST:
Previously onSurvivor...

4
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:12,172
What I have for advantage
is essentially done.

5
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:14,413
I'll push back against Bruce.
He's literally

6
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:16,206
instructing us
on how to play the game,

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,862
so, a little contradictory.

8
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:21,551
"Until you've taken possession
of the idol,

9
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,275
"you cannot vote
at Tribal Council.

10
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:24,965
"Your first task: decipher

11
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,482
the coded message
on your tribe flag."

12
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:28,034
And inside of it

13
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,206
is this.

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,827
EMILY:
It doesn't take a genius

15
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,241
to look at this group of people

16
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:34,862
and pull out
the strongest alliance.

17
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,793
-Who are we talking about?
-Sabiyah and Kaleb.

18
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:38,758
SABIYAH:
Because you look at us that way,

19
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:41,413
you have kind of
isolated yourself.

20
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:44,586
Everything in my body
is like, "I'm not

21
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:46,000
going back to that camp."

22
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,241
The tribe has spoken.

23
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:54,655
♪ ♪

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,655
But I have a ton of respect
for Hannah and her decision.

25
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:15,448
I knew Hannah had been
having struggles,

26
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,655
but not to that extent.
So, she was like,

27
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:19,758
"Send me home, please."

28
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:22,103
And part of me can see why
she would do that because

29
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:24,862
I'm feeling like
a Lululemon right now.

30
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:27,517
We are going
through the wringer.

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,137
I mean, the fact that we didn't
get a machete and pot

32
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:33,103
for a few days, and now
we're still without flint

33
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:37,378
and fire is
literal life out here.

34
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:39,206
EMILY:
For what it's worth,
tonight, for me, you know,

35
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,068
I realize as it's coming
out of my mouth, it sounds like

36
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:42,551
I am attacking you guys,

37
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:44,620
and that's not what
my intention was. I... I just...

38
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:48,103
It's been hard for me
to make inroads with people.

39
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:51,551
It doesn't necessarily give you
the right to point guns at us.

40
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:54,033
I was kind of offended,
I'm not gonna lie...

41
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,965
Like we have this,
like, secret alliance.

42
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,000
Like, you called him
"Number One"

43
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:03,137
and Sean's "Number Three"
and all this stuff.

44
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:04,931
I feel like I'm kind of
being gaslit here because

45
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:06,965
y'all are coming for me.

46
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:08,586
That's genuinely how I felt.

47
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,172
SABIYAH:
'Cause, like, you kind of

48
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:14,000
already see yourself in a way,
and it makes it hard

49
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:17,448
for us to even get to know you
because you're so adamant

50
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,241
about being somebody
that's not liked.

51
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:22,758
EMILY:
Well, my game blew up tonight,
that's for sure.

52
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:25,655
Um, it's hard
to even know where to begin.

53
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:28,689
Um, I definitely knew that my
name was on the chopping block.

54
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:31,793
My thought process was "Okay,
well, let's point out, Sabiyah,

55
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:35,137
Kaleb and Sean
have gotten really close."

56
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,965
I did not expect for Sabiyah
to react the way that she did.

57
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,862
She took it
extremely personally.

58
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,344
Is there anything
I said in particular

59
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:43,758
that I can apologize for
that will make you feel better?

60
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:45,344
I mean, I can't help how I feel,

61
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:47,793
just like how you can't help
how you say things.

62
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:50,724
But do you understand that
I knew it was do or die for me?

63
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:54,206
I had a choice to make, and
I wanted to stay in this game,

64
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,758
and excuse me for trying

65
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:58,067
to do something to, like,
you know, better that situation.

66
00:02:58,172 --> 00:02:59,827
If that's how you feel,
then that's okay.

67
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,034
-Like I said, you feel
how you feel, I feel how I feel.
-Yeah.

68
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:05,379
Hannah quit,
and we're stuck with Emily.

69
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:07,379
Oh, my goodness.

70
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:11,413
I don't feel like
she's as aware of herself

71
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:12,758
and how she comes across.

72
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:14,620
Do you think
she wants to be alone?

73
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:19,655
SABIYAH:
I feel like she's blaming us
but then not trying

74
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:20,896
to change her behavior at all.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,758
I'm having a tough time
with Emily.

76
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:24,758
Emily, like, it matters
what you say to people.

77
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:26,689
Like, I don't care
if you mean it or not.

78
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:29,103
It matters.
Like, tact is a thing.

79
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:31,103
If Emily wants to be Emily,

80
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:33,310
there's no way
I could work with her.

81
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,275
I mean, as you can see
at Tribal tonight,

82
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,067
she doesn't really mesh well
with the group.

83
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:39,448
EMILY:
I didn't know
that she was so sensitive.

84
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:40,655
SABIYAH:
Obviously,

85
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:42,896
she's bad news,
and I know she is.

91
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,344
We're actually a winning tribe.

92
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,862
I feel like a kid
in a candy shop.

93
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:08,551
This is the islands of Fiji.

94
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:10,793
Like, this is amazing,
a place to be.

95
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,827
I want to have fun for my soul,

And I'm enjoying

98

That's something
really weird, Austin,

99
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:23,689
is I can punch things
really hard with this hand,

100
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:25,586
and I don't really feel it.

101
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,827
But I used to punch trees as a
kid like it was practice for...

102
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:36,000
SIFU:
Yes!

103
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:38,655
-You okay?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

104
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:41,068
J. MAYA: I get that we have
a really good thing going,

105
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,413
but at some point, we're gonna
lose an immunity challenge.

106
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,586
So I just want an advantage
so desperately,

107
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:49,344
and I truly believe
that there is a code

108
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:50,655
hidden in that flag.

109
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:53,413
The first word, so to speak,

110
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:55,310
if we take this pattern
to be true, is

111
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:58,931
one letter, which could
only hypothetically be "A."

112
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,000
It makes sense.
It's exactly the kind of thing

113
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:03,034
thatSurvivor would do, is put

114
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:05,310
a language on the flag
that we have to decode.

115
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:08,689
If we can just figure out
which letters form words,

116
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,448
we can maybe
reverse-engineer the cipher.

117
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:13,000
I've always maintained

118
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:14,931
that visual puzzles
are kind of my specialty,

119
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,344
but I could be just
completely overthinking this.

120
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:18,931
But this is the kind of game
where you do feel like

121
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:20,448
you have to overthink things.

122
00:06:20,551 --> 00:06:23,344
There's two lines and then
there's another two lines,

123
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,931
but then the lines get weird,
but there's...

124
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:26,931
-It does...
-Returns here.

125
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:29,068
Yeah, I don't... That's why
I don't really think that...

126
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,896
DREW: Yeah.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,448
AUSTIN:
We're all superfans.
We are very smart,

128
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:35,137
very perceptive.

129
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,103
Everyone's looking
at these weird symbols,

130
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,758
trying to figure out
how to crack it.

131
00:06:38,862 --> 00:06:43,103
Little do they know, on day two,
I found a Beware Advantage, and

132
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:44,931
I have this message here

133
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:48,103
that I can use to decode
the message on the flag.

134
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:51,068
Finally, I'm by myself at camp,

135
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:53,551
and in my head I know I have

136
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:55,862
maybe, like, 15, 20,
30 seconds, maybe.

137
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:58,206
So I got up,
grabbed this note, ran.

138
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,896
My mind was racing.

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,241
My adrenaline was pumping.

140
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:03,034
I put it on the symbols

141
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:04,758
and just slid it around,
trying to find anything

142
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,689
that I could match it with.

143
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,965
No luck.

144
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:10,965
Until I realized the spacing

145
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:12,724
was what was important.

146
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:14,172
And once I was able
to figure that out,

147
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:15,965
I'm 99% sure that it says,

148
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,172
"Dig in the fallen palm tree X."

149
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,758
Now I have to find

150
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:22,965
a fallen palm tree,
I have to find an X

151
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,034
or I have to find fallen palm
trees in the shape of an X.

152
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:27,724
Finding this idol is proving

153
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:30,655
to be so much more difficult
than I thought it would be.

154
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:32,172
And right now, I have no vote,

155
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,068
which is terrifying.

156
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,655
JAKE: Bruce, you want
to give this a shot, man?

157
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:46,896
Flint. I need it.
I'm ready to go.

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,310

your ass off, man.

Yes, dude. Yes.

165

We got a pot and machete now
and flint.

166
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:03,482
It makes our lives
a whole lot easier.

167

In fact,

168
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,758
we were able to get
the fire going immediately.

169
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,275
Bruce is killing
that fire thing.

170
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,344
We call him Uncle Bruce
because you know what,

171
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,931
he's taking care of us.

00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:15,689
JAKE:
But more importantly,

174
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:17,517
Bruce is hilarious, man.

175
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,000
Ah! [laughs]

176
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,931
JAKE: He is always coming up
with a joke.

177
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,551
He's always making a face,
making a funny sound.

178
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,689
[speaking gibberish]

179
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,517
[laughs]

180
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,586
JAKE:
Reminds me of a lot of people
from Boston.

181
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,551
Like, that's kind of why
I vibe with Bruce.

182
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:35,758
-Little dunce cap.
-KENDRA: It's terrifying.
That's right.

183
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:38,172
BRUCE: The plan
of being crazy Uncle Bruce

184
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:40,309
seems to be working out
very well.

185
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:44,034
I put on that smiling face,
I laugh and giggle, but

186
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:46,275
we have things
that need to get done.

187
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,000
They're working
at a snail's pace.

188
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:51,586
You know, in the back
of my head, I'm like, "Aah!"

189
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:55,000
I feel like you're gonna
uncle me right now.

190
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:56,517
-Yup. He's got the uncle face.
-He's got his uncle face on.

191
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,034
[Jake laughs]

192
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,551
BRUCE:
I want to say,

193
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:01,344
"Go get it done,
and once it's done,

194
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,586
go do what you want."

195
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:05,413
But I can't do that to them.

196
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:07,758
Do I do it to my own kids?
Hell, yeah, I do.

197
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:10,689
We can have the pot, so put it,
like, right in the...

198
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,689
Middle. Right there.
That's good. Right there.

199
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:15,931
KATURAH: Every five minutes,

200
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,103
Bruce is
explaining you something,

201
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:19,551
telling you how to do something.

202
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:21,724
I used to navigate
via the stars,

203
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,482
and I know that right now,
it's about 12:00.

204
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:25,724
KATURAH:
He's like, "Don't call me dad,
call me uncle."

205
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:27,413
But you're acting like dad.

206
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,862
Bro, I'm gonna need you to do
me a favor. Focus on one thing.

207
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:31,517
KATURAH:
But the whole tribe--

208
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,620
they're, like, hungry for him,
and, oh, he eats it up.

209
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,896
It's, like, it feeds his soul.
I can see him happy.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,793
"Let me show you how to do it."

211
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:42,241
Oh, there were so many, so many
videos that were made online.

212
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:43,758
-JAKE: Yeah.
-Like...

213
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,758
KATURAH:
And then secondly,

214
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:50,724
Bruce became a little bit
of a celebrity

215
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:53,034
after his episode aired, and

216
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:55,793
he will keep
reminding you of it.

217
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,275
And what's the most
annoying thing

218
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,448
people can do? Name-drop.

219
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:04,827
And now, I've talked to him
a bunch of times. Coolest dude.

220
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:06,000
He's a threat, and he's trying

221
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:07,862
to play it down,

222
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:09,758
and nobody sees it.

223
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:13,137
I'm like, "What the hell?!"
Is everybody blind here?

224
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:24,379
EMILY:
There has to be something hidden
in this camp somewhere.

225
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,275
I feel like my game--
it's do-or-die right now.

226
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,827
I can't just sit around
and do nothing.

227
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,413
So I need to do something
to at least

228
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:31,965
make myself feel better,
and I need to just keep looking

229
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:34,310
to the extent that I can
without it being suspicious.

230
00:10:36,275 --> 00:10:37,758
Yeah.

231
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:39,275
BRANDON:
I think one of you guys have
to go with her.

232
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:41,379
KALEB:
So our option would be

233
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:44,310
-to do an idol search
in pairs or in teams...
-SEAN: Yeah.

234
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:46,275
so that way there's somebody
who has an eye on her.

235
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,482
-BRANDON: Yeah.
-KALEB: Seriously.
Emily's, like...

236
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:51,068
She's already searching,
so we might as well... find her.

237
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:58,551
BRANDON:
Emily is desperate,
and she's looking for the idol.

238
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:00,586
That's not good.

239
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,551
She is now
public enemy number one.

240
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:06,344
BRANDON:
We were kind of running around

241
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:08,034
like chickens
with our heads cut off

242
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:11,241
searching for Emily,
but really, I would love

243
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,931
to go find that idol.

244
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:14,586
I know how to find these idols.

245
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:16,413
I've watched people find these
idols. I know the strategies.

246
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:18,344
Not only did I want to get it.
I just

247
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:20,482
didn't want Emily to get it.

248
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:23,000
Emily?

249
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,620
Hey. Just had a talk
with everybody.

250
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:28,620
We all agreed
we're all splitting up.

251
00:11:28,724 --> 00:11:30,000
It's me and you,
and then the boys are going.

252
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:32,482
This was our way
of including you.

253
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:33,965
-See? You know what I mean?
-Yeah. I mean, I can read

254
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,448
between the lines on this,
though, which is

255
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,379
that y'all don't want me
to find the idol independently.

256
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:38,724
-Yeah, if you...
-Um, so...

257
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:44,551
Okay. I mean,
that's your prerogative.

258
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:45,931
EMILY:
I think it was
a little bit obvious to say,

259
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:47,241
"Hey, Emily,
pair up with Sabiyah

260
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:48,758
so you guys
can go look together."

261
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:50,379
So, I kind of had to speak up,
but I realized

262
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:52,620
that probably put a bad taste
in the tribe's mouth,

263
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:54,103
but I think the tribe
already has a bad taste

264
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:56,068
in their mouth about me,
so I have very little to lose.

265
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:57,551
Where are you gonna head to?

266
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,103
I'm just gonna follow this path,
see where it leads me.

267
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:00,482
KALEB:
Cool.

268
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,000
EMILY:
There's a scramble right now.

269
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:03,827
We're all looking for idols, so,

270
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,896
I prefer to search on my own.

271
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,206
But the problem is that
everybody won't leave me alone.

272
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,172
I'm doing everything in my power
to kind of separate.

273
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:11,620
If I don't find this idol,

274
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:13,137
and if the rest
of the tribe finds it, then,

275
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,241
I'm 100% the person
being voted out

276
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:16,758
the next time
we go to Tribal Council.

277
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:18,310
It's gonna be somewhere
we've looked at this point.

278
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:19,655
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

279
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:21,655
We just got to look better.
I would love

280
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:23,413
-to know where this thing
is at today.
-Shut the ...

281
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:25,344
Wait, wait. And...

282
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:27,482
Holy ... dude. Holy...

283
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:33,068
[Brandon speaks
high-pitched gibberish]

284
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:34,448
Okay, okay.

285
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,172
BRANDON:
I found an idol inSurvivor,

286
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:37,758
and I freaked out.

287
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh!

288
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:45,965
Okay, so here's my thing
with these.

289
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:47,379
I don't want to open it.

290
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:48,965
It's the Beware Advantage.

291
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,517
I know that
you're not allowed to vote

292
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,241
if you have the Beware Advantage
in your possession

293
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:53,965
and you don't complete the task.

294
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:56,034
Do you want to open it?
Like, I don't...

295
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,793
I am adamantly saying
I don't want to open it.

296
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:02,206
BRANDON:
My vote is integral
in this game.

297
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,724
I didn't want to risk it.

298
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:06,413
And giving that advantage
to Sabiyah solidifies us.

299
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:07,965
We're bonded to each other.

300
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:12,862
"Retrieve it..."

301
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:24,482
Oh, my God. All right.

302
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:34,034
SABIYAH:
Fortunately, Brandon, he's like,

303
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,000
"Uh, Sabiyah,
I don't want to open it."

304
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:37,862
And I'm like,

305
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:39,655
"Yeah, buddy, bring it on!"

306
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:42,034
'Cause I... I want to...
I'm here to play.

307
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:43,724
Give me that Beware Advantage.

308
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,103
Oh.

309
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:57,689
So, if you line up
the corners...

310
00:13:57,793 --> 00:14:01,103
like that, it perfectly aligns

311
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,896
with that tree right there.

312
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:13,689
SABIYAH:
I was on the move.

313
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:15,034
Come on.

314
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:16,482
I knew exactly
where I was going.

315
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:18,241
I hadn't been there,
but it was almost like a call.

316
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,689
Mm-hmm.

317
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,241
You think you can give me,
like, a little tabletop?

318
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:32,482
One, two, three.

319
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,827
-All right.
-Okay.

320
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:41,482
SABIYAH:
I'm looking high and low

321
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:43,000
for something that sticks out,

322
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,482
something
that's not quite right.

323
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:45,965
God, this is killing me.

324
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,241
But this seems like
it's about to be

325
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,206
a scavenger hunt from hell.

326
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,965
God, I feel like
we've been gone too long.

327
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:54,586
Yeah, man. I might have
to ask Sean what he thinks.

328
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,586
The next step was to tell Sean
and to tell Kaleb, 'cause

329
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,275
if I have it, they...
they got to know about it.

330
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:03,862
This is the note.
I don't have a vote.

331
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:05,310
Dude, you keep
pulling out more paper.

332
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:06,931
[laughing]

333
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:08,413
SABIYAH:
I know that that would cement

334
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:11,241
our alliance going forward.

335
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:14,517
-You think it's this one?
-For sure.

336
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,379
-Are you... are you okay?
-I'm good.

337
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,275
SABIYAH:
I could feel the presence
of the idol,

338
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:21,275
you know, and I start getting
that tingly feeling.

339
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,965
And we walked all around that
tree, and we couldn't find it.

340
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:27,896
Dang, Jeff, for real.

341
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,620
All right.

342
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,655
I need my vote.
I need to think this through

343
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:38,551
and then come back
at a later time.

344
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:39,965
If it's in this tree,
I don't care if we have

345
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:41,862
to lift it out of its roots,
it's here.

346
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:57,586
-DEE: It looks worse
in the sock.
-[laughing]

347
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,000
DEE: So, my toes are pretty.
It's just that

348
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:03,137
my big toe is just abnormally
longer than my other toes,

349
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,931
'cause it's usually
like this, right?

350
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:08,344
But then this toe is like this.
[laughs]

351
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,620
I think it looks worse
with the sock on.

352
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:11,965
Can you take my sock off?

353
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:13,931
SIFU:
I don't know, man.

354
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:15,482
Ooh. Ooh.

355
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,931
-Oh, my God.
-[Dee laughs]

356
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:18,586
SIFU:
Dang!

357
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:20,482
DEE:
Is that, like, really long?

358
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:22,206
[laughing]

359
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,241
DEE: But you know what, guys?

360
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,793
SIFU: Great grip. Yes.

361
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:28,724
-DEE: You want me to pinch you?
-SIFU: Yeah. Do it, do it.

362
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,275
-Ow!
-[laughing]

363
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:35,448
DEE:
Everybody's laughing now,
but they won't laugh later

364
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:38,103
when I win
based off a balance challenge.

365
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:41,379
AUSTIN:
Oh, my God.
Well, you could, like,

366
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:44,275
-pick up, like, a backpack.
-[laughing]

367
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,965
DEE:
That big toe, baby.
Let's go. Big toe energy.

368
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,103
[whoops] Let's go! [laughs]

369
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:54,724
SIFU:
This is such a weird thing
to say, but do you honestly

370
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:56,206
think, we're walking
down the street,

371
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,586
any of us would be friends?

372
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:58,931
Like, you know
what I mean? Like,

373
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:00,724
you would just look at me
and be like,

374
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,379
-"I would just want
to talk to Nick." You know?
-Not like...

375
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:03,931
I mean, only if, like, y'all
were, like, my kids' friends.

376
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:05,517
Yeah. Yeah.

377
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,550
-Right? Right.
-DEE: I guess it depends
on the situation.

378
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:09,068
JULIE: I've taken on

379
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:11,792
the role of Mama. I am Mama J.

380
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,034
And I'm kind of
leaning into that.

381
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:16,000
I was, like, super paranoid
the first two days.

382
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:19,000
-That's all I was.
-Yeah.

383
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,723
JULIE:
Dee is my closest ally.

384
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:23,205
I feel like she's gonna play
a loyal game, but I have

385
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,827
to have other alliances.

386
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:26,655
You know what, Drew?
You said that you

387
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,310
try to work hard
to listen to people?

388
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:31,724
-Yeah.
-I feel like you do that.

389
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,413
-I really try to.
-I feel it.

390
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,931
-Yeah, I...
-No, I feel like
you're engaged in that.

391
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:37,655
I really like Drew.

392
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,413
He's my son's age.

393
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,000
Drew needs a mom out here,
so I need to make him think

394
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,655
he can get through another day
because I'm here.

395
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,896
-You know?
-That's what I'm saying.

396
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,793
-I'm starving too much
to like, "Ooh, ooh."
-I know it.

397
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:55,551
But see,
I feel "loyal game" with you.

398
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:57,241
Oh, my God. I'm...

399
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,965
Literally, I could give you
a hug. I'm so happy.

400
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:00,827
Okay. Here's the other thing.
I work...

401
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:04,551
DREW: Yeah. Okay.

402
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:07,689
DREW: I love Austin.

403
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:09,103
-Yeah.
-Like, do you...?

404
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:11,482
Oh, Julie,
I can literally cry, man.

405
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:12,862
DREW:
Oh, I've been so nervous.

406
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:14,896
Julie wants to go
with the same four

407
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,724
I had already been planning.

408
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:20,241
Myself, Austin, Dee and Julie.

409
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:25,517
-I'm so glad, dude. So glad.
-All right, good, good, good.

410
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,103
DREW:
This is gonna
be the solid group.

411
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,758
So, I have

412
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:30,965
a lot of allies at this point,
which is a nice feeling.

413
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,241
AUSTIN:
Us four, 100%.

414
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:34,586
Okay, cool.
You feel good with us four?

415
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,275
-Like, 100%.
-Me too.

416
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,827
There is a part of me
that wants to be the king,

417
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:41,379
that wants
to domineer the tribe,

418
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:43,689
and I have
to tone that down now.

419
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:45,724
But I do envision a time

420
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:47,965
when my realm will stretch
to the whole beach.

421
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:50,586
Right now,
I am marshaling my troops

422
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:52,034
and making my feudal alliances

423
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:54,689
to bring this kingdom
into fruition.

424
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:02,862
♪ ♪

425
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:31,206
KALEB: I think I'm really
starting to get Emily.

426
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,344
She is somebody who likes to go
by facts and the numbers.

427
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:36,586
The problem with Emily
is she has a big mouth

428
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,103
and she can't get out
of her own way.

429
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:40,034
You know, I don't have
very many cards at this point.

430
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,172
What can I do
to build that trust?

431
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:44,586
-I think just try
and keep the strategizing lower.
-Yeah?

432
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,344
KALEB:
People are hating on her, but

433
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:49,689
all I'm thinking to myself is,
"How can I possibly help?"

434
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:53,172
Maybe I can nurse her back
to health,

435
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,379
nurse her as a stronger,
better player.

436
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:58,068
-I want to look out for you.
-Okay.

437
00:19:58,172 --> 00:20:00,000
But for now, just be helpful,
be positive.

438
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:01,827
-Mm-hmm.
-You know? And, um,

439
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,551
-like, sharing stories
about yourself.
-Mm-hmm.

440
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:05,448
-Like, it's gonna really help.
You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

441
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,068
But I just feel like
it's just, like...

442
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,620
It's what the tribe needs
right now.

443
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,758
I think I brought a bazooka
go to a tea party.

444
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:13,448
-Mm-hmm.
-Um, and I need
to put the bazooka down.

445
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:14,931
KALEB:
A bad player is gonna want

446
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:17,413
to continue to isolate her,
continue

447
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,448
to make sure that she knows
that she's on the outs,

448
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,068
and, "Don't even try
and talk to me."

449
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:23,310
I want to play with you, and I
hope you can see me as an asset.

450
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:25,551
You're the only person
who's talked to me, really.

451
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:28,620
KALEB:
A good player is probably
gonna realize that

452
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:32,000
everyone needs an ally,
and Emily doesn't have anybody,

453
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,413
and I'm the person who's being
the most up-front with her.

454
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:36,482
And I think that I'm making
really good inroads.

455
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:42,000
-Hmm?
-You're very kind.

456
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,000
EMILY:
We had a good conversation.

457
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:45,448
Kaleb actually showed me

458
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:46,758
there's definitely
a lesson for the game

459
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,103
moving forward, right?

460
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,793
But there's also a lesson
for life,

461
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:52,000
which is, you know, when things
get stressful, what do you do?

462
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:55,862
In my job-- analyzing stocks--

463
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:57,655
it's analytical at nature,

464
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,206
but this is an emotional game.

465
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,068
I'm discovering that.
These people are not stocks.

466
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:04,517
Uh, people have feelings
and emotions.

467
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,586
Yeah.

468
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:08,586
I was being defensive,

469
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:10,482
-and I apologize for that. Yeah.
-I was being defensive.

470
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,103
-And I wasbeing defensive.
-I apologize
for being defensive.

471
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:13,793
EMILY:
You can't brute-force
things in life,

472
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:16,793
and I tried to brute-force
this game. And now I'm taking

473
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:18,517
some of these lessons
to heart, right?

474
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,758
Learning to be more calm,
learning to be less aggressive.

475
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:24,344
Yeah.

476
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:26,620
I-I can't wait
for you to eventually see it.

477
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:28,413
-It is stunning.
-[laughs]

478
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:30,758
EMILY:
But it's hard,
you know, for a tiger

479
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:32,310
to change its stripes
in some sense,

480
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:34,965
and so I need-I need
to try more than I am.

481
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:39,379
...and further kind of
irritating people.

482
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:40,827
But I also don't want it
to be like,

483
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,413
"Oh, Emily's not even, like,
trying to talk with us."

484
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:43,896
-I know.
-It feels like a weird situation

485
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,241
where I don't even know, like,
what the right thing

486
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,758
-to do is, kind of.
-Right.

487
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:49,034
EMILY:
I worry about playing too hard.

488
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:50,689
I feel like so much
of the issues

489
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:52,689
that I've had here
has been attitude.

490
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:55,689
And that's so hard to change.

491
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:58,000
Because attitude is so ingrained
in who you are.

492
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:00,482
And I've always been
this anxious,

493
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,827
nervous pessimist,
this-this...

494
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:04,413
It sounds good
to say "go-getter,"

495
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:06,000
and I mean that
in the worst way possible.

496
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:09,275
This go-getter that can't know
when to just kind of stop.

497
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:11,137
You all right?

498
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,206
Emotional day for me
for some reason.

499
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,620
-Don't worry.
-Don't worry.

500
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,724
Wow, the tide's really gone out.

501
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:22,586
I'm so sorry. I don't know why
I'm getting emotional.

502
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:24,206
It's that I feel like all these
emotions are just bubbling up.

503
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,482
But I have to remind myself

on the back of them.

you get your advantage.

00:29:57,551 --> 00:29:59,000
God, I'm choking.

671
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:01,103
Let's just calm down.

672
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:07,310
Oh, my God.

673
00:30:09,862 --> 00:30:11,689
Oh, yes!

674
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:15,241
Come on! Let's go!

675
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:16,862
Ah!

676
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:19,206
I want to vomit.

677
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:23,379
Oh, my God. How?
How is this happening?

678
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,655
This is a comedy of errors.

679
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:28,310
No.

680
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:30,724
Did I screw up a tile?

681
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,689
That's the same.

682
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,241
My matching was bad. My...

683
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:37,482
I was not good at matching.

684
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,551
Oh, my God.

685
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:40,137
I thought I had low points,

686
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:43,034
but this is the challenge
that was made for me!

687
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:44,344
A matching game that you would
give a kid in day care

688
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:46,000
to keep them occupied
for 20 minutes.

689
00:30:46,103 --> 00:30:50,517
Well, I get to go back to camp
with no vote, so that's good.

690
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,827
I didn't want
the Beware Advantage

691
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:52,862
'cause I didn't want
to not have a vote.

692
00:30:52,965 --> 00:30:53,965
Now I don't have a vote.

693
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:55,586
Great!

694
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,275
Luckily, if we lose the
immunity challenge coming up,

695
00:30:57,379 --> 00:30:59,655
I feel good going
into the next Tribal Council.

696
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,655
I know that Emily is going
to leave once we get there,

697
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:03,655
but this is my low point.

698
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:05,689
Heck, yes.

699
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:23,689
I'm so happy.
I could have fallen to my knees.

700
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:25,482
It's the Safety without Power
Advantage.

701
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:27,137
It is
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

702
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:28,689
I have power in the game.

703
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:30,448
You know, a guy like me
is very ambitious.

704
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:32,862
You know,
he's always looking for more.

705
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:34,206
I have the Survivoritch,

706
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,620
and the only thing
that's gonna scratch it

707
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:38,103
is more firepower,
more ammunition.

708
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,413
[whooping, yelling]

709
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:51,689
Welcome home, buddy!

710
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:53,862
SABIYAH:
Yeah!

711
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:55,862
-That feels like a win.
-Yeah.

712
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:58,137
-That feels like a win
if there ever was one.
-Oh, sure.

713
00:31:58,241 --> 00:31:59,793
EMILY:
I'm so excited
to hear what happened.

714
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:03,103
-How'd it go?
-Um,

715
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:06,620
so we get there,
we walk up a mountain, and

716
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,137
we get to the game
where we can risk the vote...

717
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:10,586
-EMILY: Oh.
-and play the game,

718
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:13,000
-which I did, and I-I...
-SABIYAH: Mm-hmm.

719
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:15,206
You had three minutes to do it.
I didn't do it.

720
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,517
-SABIYAH: Oh.
-So I have no vote.

721
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,034
-Okay.
-BRANDON: So...

722
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:21,482
SEAN:
In the first immunity challenge,

723
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:24,620
Brandon really struggled
with the puzzle.

724
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:28,896
Now he goes to this journey,
was unsuccessful.

725
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,517
You told us
you're the puzzle guy.

726
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,034
And so,
it makes you wonder, like,

727
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:35,137
"Where are your strengths?"

728
00:32:36,896 --> 00:32:38,931
DREW:
Hello?

729
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:41,310
Huh.

730
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:44,068
Hello?

731
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:53,758
-Hello?
-ALL: Surprise!

732
00:32:55,137 --> 00:32:57,206
DREW:
Oh, my God. My tribemates--

733
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,172
they all run right out
from behind the shelter,

734
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:01,137
and they all start
rubbing my head.

735
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:02,793
I don't know why
that is a thing,

736
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,586
but they are all
rubbing my head.

737
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:06,586
All right, do you want
the best bits first, or just,

738
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:08,206
like, the dollar score in order?

739
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,586
DREW:
It's such a warm welcome
that I know

740
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:14,068
the right route is to tell the
truth, to tell the full truth.

741
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:16,482
All right, so here's the story.

742
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:18,172
Walked up this long beach,

743
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:20,000
and on the island is,
like, a puzzle.

744
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:21,344
If I solve the puzzle
in three minutes,

745
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:22,827
I'll get, like, an advantage.

746
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,655
And I did well. I solved it.

747
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:25,862
-Nice.
-And so...

748
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:27,344
-Whoa!
-[gasping]

749
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:28,724
DREW:
The advantage is
a Safety without Power.

750
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:30,241
"It allows you
to leave Tribal Council

751
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:32,551
"just before the votes are cast
and return to camp.

752
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:33,724
"You will not cast a vote,
but more importantly,

753
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:34,827
you cannot be voted out."

754
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,000
AUSTIN: So Drew comes back

755
00:33:37,103 --> 00:33:39,000
and straight-up shows us
the note saying,

756
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:40,655
"I have a Safety without Power."

757
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:42,724
I feel that he's really trying
to play a loyal game.

758
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:45,137
The real utility is gonna happen
come the merge.

759
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:48,758
So my hope is that if one of us
is, like, in real danger...

760
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,344
-You give it to us.
-Yeah, we can just give this

761
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,034
to the Reba member
who is in trouble.

762
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:53,482
AUSTIN:
Drew came very clean

763
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:55,724
about his journey,
and I feel like

764
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:59,103
he is someone who wants to truly
play with somebody like me.

765
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:01,000
-Yo.
-Yeah.

766
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:02,862
I found a Beware Advantage.

767
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:04,241
-You're kidding.
-No.

768
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,724
-Okay.
-I found it.

769
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,655
I was gathering wood
right by the beach over there.

770
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:09,344
DREW:
Austin shared
his Beware Advantage with me.

771
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,896
There are, like,

772
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,413
explosions in my head, there are
fireworks. I'm so excited.

773
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:17,620
It spelled out,
"Dig at the fallen palm tree X."

774
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,862
DREW:
The best partnerships
inSurvivor are ones

775
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,310
that complement one another.

776
00:34:21,413 --> 00:34:22,724
He has the physicality,

777
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,275
he has the good looks,
he has the charm,

778
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:26,206
and I have the brains.

779
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,793
I came into this game saying
I wanted, like,

780
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:29,620
-a J.T. to my Stephen, you know?
-I know!

781
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:32,862
Like, and you're the guy, so
I'm willing to go all the way.

782
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:35,206
Austin right now
is my ride or die.

783
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,034
I am committed to him
to the moon and back.

784
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,413
[laughing]

785
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:43,931
KENDRA: Oh, God. I knew

786
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:46,344
-I was gonna suffocate myself.
-Oh, my God.

787
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:48,688
KELLIE:
It doesn't stretch that much.

788
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:50,793
-Oh, yours looks pretty good.
-No.

789
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:54,068
-I'm going for it.
-Yeah, I was gonna...

790
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:55,827
-Oh, my God!
-Yas, queen!

791
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:57,344
[laughing]

792
00:34:57,448 --> 00:34:59,344
Don't know how you do this
on regular basis.

793
00:34:59,448 --> 00:35:00,620
-Not easy.
-No. Just...

794
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,689
[yelling, indistinct chatter]

795
00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:05,689
KELLIE:
Doesn't stop, he doesn't stop.

796
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:07,206
BRANDO: Coming into this game,

797
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,965
I was really worried
that as a 22-year-old, young,

798
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,310
scrawny, Asian guy, no one would
really want to work with me.

799
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:15,000
But being out here and being out
of my comfort zone

800
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:17,413
is what makes it exciting, and

801
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:18,689
I'm kind of killing it
right now.

802
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:20,482
KATURAH: Come on, Brando.

803
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:21,862
KATURAH: You got it. You got it.

804
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:24,034
-Hilarious.
-[laughing]

805
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:25,620
BRANDO:
Putting on my own Buff
as a top--

806
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,172
Uh, I don't think
it's the most common thing

807
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:28,448
for guys inSurvivor to do.

808
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:30,655
But, you know, honestly, I feel

809
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:32,206
really comfortable
in that situation

810
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,758
'cause I've never been someone
who, you know,

811
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:35,379
bros out with the big guys.

812
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:37,724
I really like the idea
of working with you,

813
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:39,103
-KELLIE: Yeah.
-and I just wanted to say that.

814
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:40,551
Well, that's a good thing
to hear.

815
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:42,172
-Yeah, we love you.
-No. And I wanted to, like,

816
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:44,034
pull you aside
and just say that to you.

817
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:46,206
You always see like, "Oh, the
weakest woman goes home first."

818
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,896
And I really did not want that
to happen.

819
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,965
KENDRA:
I would love
to work with Brando.

820
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,620
And right now, the girls

821
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:53,482
are three strong, and you're not
gonna break us up.

822
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:54,931
So, I think he sees the numbers.

823
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:56,551
He's a smart dude.
He knows percentages.

824
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,896
So better

825
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,379
join us than be against us.

826
00:35:59,482 --> 00:36:00,965
I want to go far

827
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:03,344
in this game with people
that I admire and I trust.

828
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:05,482
The only thing we can have is,
like, trust in people.

829
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:06,793
Right. Right.

830
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:07,862
KELLIE:
I don't know. Right now, so...

831
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,586
Yeah. I'm sure
they're talking right now.

832
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:14,034
-Can I just tell you how I think
it's gonna go down?
-Yeah.

833
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,413
You definitely
hit it on the head saying

834
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:20,172
that they're gonna
go after the guys.

835
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:22,034
I would 100% bet it was me.

836
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:24,413
-I think this time...
-They're gonna come at me first.

837
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:25,827
-It is what it is.
-You're very social, dude.

838
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:28,344
You have the charisma

my strengths coming out here was

that I can bro out with dudes,
and I can, you know, be besties

00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:35,965
Come on, vote. I need you.

1174
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:37,620
[gasping]

1175
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,551
[laughs]

1176
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:41,413
SEAN:
Shut.

1177
00:50:41,517 --> 00:50:43,862
-Ah!
-KALEB: What?!
-[Sabiyah exclaims]

1178
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:47,689
Yo...

1179
00:50:48,827 --> 00:50:51,034
Oh, holy...

1180
00:50:51,137 --> 00:50:52,310
KALEB:
All right.

1181
00:51:01,068 --> 00:51:03,000
-[laughing]
-No!

1182
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,931
The note says,

1183
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:09,724
"You must melt the candle
to get the idol."

1184
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:14,448
Thanks, Jeff, 'cause Lulu
hasn't had fire this whole time.

1185
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:17,482
So I don't have a vote
and I don't have my idol.

1186
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:20,034
My heart drops.

1187
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:21,620
[Brandon whistles]

1188
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:23,724
Yeah.

1189
00:51:24,724 --> 00:51:26,000
Shut up.

1190
00:51:26,103 --> 00:51:27,965
But it's in a candle.

1191
00:51:28,068 --> 00:51:30,310
I have to burn it
but we have no flint.

1192
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:33,655
I will not even
be voting tonight.

1193
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:40,103
That's what I was thinking, but
I'm worried about everything.

1194
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:42,137
BRANDON:
I hate this.
Sabiyah doesn't have a vote

1195
00:51:42,241 --> 00:51:43,482
and nor do I.

1196
00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:45,586
This is now
a three-vote Tribal Council.

1197
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:46,655
I'm very nervous, but listen,

1198
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:49,034
I know how good I am socially.

1199
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:50,689
Socially, I am the bomb.

1200
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:53,793
My pitch is that, you know,
I will be loyal.

1201
00:51:53,896 --> 00:51:55,620
If we hit any kind of situation

1202
00:51:55,724 --> 00:51:57,655
where we have to split up,
I'm Lulu strong.

1203
00:51:57,758 --> 00:52:00,103
-I'm with y'all.
-Totally.
-SEAN: And we trust you.

1204
00:52:00,206 --> 00:52:02,068
BRANDON:
It's gonna be me or Emily,
but one of us

1205
00:52:02,172 --> 00:52:03,551
is gonna be here tomorrow.

1206
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:05,310
We don't know who it's gonna be,
but whoever it is has

1207
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,758
got to fight, and Emily has
made people angry. I haven't.

1208
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,862
I don't know if this...
I want to help solidify trust.

1209
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:11,275
-SABIYAH: Yeah.
-I don't have a lot of options

1210
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:13,344
-right now
to help solidify trust.
-Okay.

1211
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:21,931
-Wow.
-You guys have my trust.

1212
00:52:22,034 --> 00:52:24,241
This is getting on the same page
at Tribal Council knowing

1213
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,482
that we can trust each other
and move forward as a team.

1214
00:52:26,586 --> 00:52:28,310
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Of course.

1215
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:30,275
Yeah.

1216
00:52:30,379 --> 00:52:32,620
EMILY:
I am at the stage
of desperation, so,

1217
00:52:32,724 --> 00:52:34,379
I gave Sabiyah the
Shot in the Dark to build trust.

1218
00:52:34,482 --> 00:52:35,862
I'm trying to buy myself

1219
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:38,965
enough time to permanently
change my position,

1220
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:41,034
instead of treading water
like I am right now.

1221
00:52:41,137 --> 00:52:43,241
I gave Sabiyah
my Shot in the Dark just

1222
00:52:43,344 --> 00:52:45,103
-to show, you know, like,
I'm not gonna play it.
-Trust.

1223
00:52:45,206 --> 00:52:46,448
Yeah. Trust me.

1224
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:47,793
I'm just praying

1225
00:52:47,896 --> 00:52:50,103
the tribe truly wants
to vote out Brandon.

1226
00:52:50,206 --> 00:52:51,931
And I hope
I can turn this around,

1227
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:55,206
and I think if it does turn
around, it's all on Kaleb.

1228
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,827
When we started this momentum

1229
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:58,137
of working together,
this has just...

1230
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,310
It's been great so far, okay?

1231
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:03,206
Emily's playing it smart,
and I'm standing there being

1232
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,103
like, "You're doing
a great job." You know?

1233
00:53:05,206 --> 00:53:07,379
Like... she's listening.
It's working.

1234
00:53:07,482 --> 00:53:09,689
And I think having Emily
as an asset is gonna

1235
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:11,413
be a very valuable thing
for me.

1236
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:13,034
-And we'll have
each other's back, okay?
-Awesome.

1237
00:53:13,137 --> 00:53:15,103
KALEB:
And I hope
Sean and Sabiyah realize

1238
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:17,655
we can actually work with Emily
deeper into this game.

1239
00:53:17,758 --> 00:53:19,482
SABIYAH:
Emily just makes me feel like

1240
00:53:19,586 --> 00:53:21,862
she will just cut my throat
in the night.

1241
00:53:24,448 --> 00:53:26,000
Brandon is just... I love him...

1242
00:53:28,448 --> 00:53:30,275
-It's true. It's true.
-I have it.

1243
00:53:33,275 --> 00:53:34,862
SABIYAH:
Emily has given me her word

1244
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:37,068
and her Shot in the Dark, but

1245
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,827
she's someone
that's a snake in the grass,

1246
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:41,206
and that's scary
to keep that around.

1247
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,793
You really want
to play with us or what?

1248
00:53:42,896 --> 00:53:45,724
Yes. Yes, more than anything.

1249
00:53:45,827 --> 00:53:47,241
-Seriously?
-More than anything.

1250
00:53:47,344 --> 00:53:50,517
And I hope you can see
that I bring a bit of vitality

1251
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,241
to this tribe in a way
that Brandon doesn't.

1252
00:53:53,344 --> 00:53:55,000
SABIYAH:
I have friends like Brandon.

1253
00:53:55,103 --> 00:53:57,689
I know I can
trust Brandon to the end.

1254
00:53:57,793 --> 00:53:59,482
If we vote Brandon tonight,

1255
00:53:59,586 --> 00:54:02,310
do we win with Emily?
Realistically?

1256
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:06,965
It can go either way.

1257
00:54:07,068 --> 00:54:09,206
But I don't trust Emily.

1258
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:12,689
I don't have a vote,
but in a way, I do.

1259
00:54:12,793 --> 00:54:14,275
Kaleb and Sean--

1260
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:16,655
they basically have said,
"Well, who do you want?"

1261
00:54:17,724 --> 00:54:19,275
I haven't considered

1262
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:22,000
myself being in control
of this tribe,

1263
00:54:22,103 --> 00:54:24,931
but it's kind of been that way,
and I like it.

1264
00:54:36,379 --> 00:54:38,379
♪ ♪

1265
00:54:58,448 --> 00:55:02,275
All right.
Welcome back to Tribal Council.

1266
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:05,551
So, Sabiyah,
what I'm most curious about

1267
00:55:05,655 --> 00:55:08,413
is what happened last Tribal

1268
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:10,827
in what was clearly
a heated Tribal

1269
00:55:10,931 --> 00:55:12,965
that then took a left turn
as Hannah pleaded

1270
00:55:13,068 --> 00:55:15,275
-to go home and you let her.
-Right.

1271
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:17,448
I thought that all that heat
was gonna get resolved

1272
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:19,275
with a snuff, you know?

1273
00:55:19,379 --> 00:55:20,620
So let me just interrupt.

1274
00:55:20,724 --> 00:55:22,068
Does that mean that it was Emily

1275
00:55:22,172 --> 00:55:25,310
going home because
the heat was between you two?

1276
00:55:25,413 --> 00:55:27,793
Either it meant it was her
or it was gonna

1277
00:55:27,896 --> 00:55:30,137
be a snuff to kind of
shut her up a little bit.

1278
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:31,896
-You know?
-PROBST: So, Brandon,

1279
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,724
what do you read into that,
because somebody was going home?

1280
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:37,241
Yeah. I knew Emily and I
were on the bottom.

1281
00:55:37,344 --> 00:55:39,586
I went in not wanting it
to be me. I was gonna do what

1282
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:41,620
I thought the most people were
gonna do, so I was voting Emily.

1283
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:44,137
PROBST:
So, Sean, give me
the tribe dynamic here.

1284
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:45,862
SEAN:
You know, coming back

1285
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:48,206
from the challenge today,

1286
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:51,275
both Emily and Brandon said,

1287
00:55:51,379 --> 00:55:52,586
"Sabiyah, Kaleb, Sean,

1288
00:55:52,689 --> 00:55:54,551
why don't the three of you
go off and talk?"

1289
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:58,379
So that's where
the alliance right now stands.

1290
00:55:58,482 --> 00:56:01,724
So, are all five of you
in agreement that

1291
00:56:01,827 --> 00:56:04,068
it's Emily or Brandon tonight?

1292
00:56:05,103 --> 00:56:07,379
-Yes.
-Yeah.
PROBST: Okay. So,

1293
00:56:07,482 --> 00:56:10,793
we rarely have this, where it's
so clearly between two people.

1294
00:56:10,896 --> 00:56:12,586
Brandon, let's start with you.

1295
00:56:12,689 --> 00:56:14,517
What case do you make
to remind everybody

1296
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,137
what qualities
you bring to the tribe?

1297
00:56:16,241 --> 00:56:19,275
So, Jeff, this is something
I'm certainly not used to.

1298
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:21,655
Like, this is my first team.
Right? I don't play sports.

1299
00:56:21,758 --> 00:56:24,793
I'm not used to losing because
I'm not used to playing, right?

1300
00:56:24,896 --> 00:56:26,758
I came back from the challenge
very defeated.

1301
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:28,379
This is my second puzzle
that I did not do.

1302
00:56:28,482 --> 00:56:31,310
And the puzzle at the journey--
I lost that one, too.

1303
00:56:31,413 --> 00:56:32,965
So maybe it's just,
puzzles aren't my thing, but

1304
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:34,413
it's a situation where...

1305
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:36,000
-But you told us that they were.
-Well...

1306
00:56:36,103 --> 00:56:38,000
And that's-that's really
my caveat.

1307
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,931
We just really,
as a tribe, need him

1308
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:42,862
to be like, "This is
what I can do," and it be true.

1309
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:44,551
BRANDON:
I do maintain that the puzzles

1310
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:46,793
that I do were just bad day.

1311
00:56:46,896 --> 00:56:48,241
But I am loyal to you guys.

1312
00:56:48,344 --> 00:56:49,793
You know, Emily has had issues
with these people,

1313
00:56:49,896 --> 00:56:52,000
and these people know
that I'm Lulu strong.

1314
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:56,172
Kaleb, Brandon's saying,
"I'm loyal, I'm with you."

1315
00:56:56,275 --> 00:56:59,103
That also is a valuable quality
in this game.

1316
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:01,000
KALEB:
Yeah. You know, his ability

1317
00:57:01,103 --> 00:57:03,586
to be vulnerable, to bring
people in, to tell a story--

1318
00:57:03,689 --> 00:57:05,620
it is really valuable.

1319
00:57:05,724 --> 00:57:07,206
Emily, you know,
was trying to play

1320
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,172
all 26 days of Survivor
in the first, you know, week.

1321
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:12,448
But, you know, what does
an open mind at least look like?

1322
00:57:12,551 --> 00:57:14,862
Maybe it would be
taking a chance with Emily

1323
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:17,896
or it would be knowing we
already have that with Brandon.

1324
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,517
Now, I will say,
to Emily's credit,

1325
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,034
after our last Tribal Council,

1326
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:24,068
a few of us gave her
some feedback, and

1327
00:57:24,172 --> 00:57:25,758
Emily's taken that to heart.

1328
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:27,827
And she's shown
a good faith effort

1329
00:57:27,931 --> 00:57:30,793
to be the sweet Emily
that we know she is.

1330
00:57:30,896 --> 00:57:35,137
PROBST:
So, Brandon, what do you do now
in this moment

1331
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:37,310
when you're hearing the three--
who seem to be in charge--

1332
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:40,034
saying that they are weighing,
and it's not a slam dunk?

1333
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:42,551
BRANDON:
It's a gigantic decision, but

1334
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,137
there's gonna be a challenge
that I know

1335
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:46,000
that I will be able
to compete, physically.

1336
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:48,068
-I've gotten unlucky.
-PROBST: It's interesting to me

1337
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:50,758
that you just pitched yourself
physically again.

1338
00:57:50,862 --> 00:57:53,206
-Yeah.
-And this is not to liken

1339
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:56,965
my story to yours, but
when I was a kid in junior high,

1340
00:57:57,068 --> 00:57:59,620
tried out
for the basketball team,

1341
00:57:59,724 --> 00:58:01,275
didn't have a left-handed layup.

1342
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:02,931
I didn't make the team.

1343
00:58:03,034 --> 00:58:05,275
But you know what
they asked me to be?

1344
00:58:05,379 --> 00:58:06,344
The water boy.

1345
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:08,172
-Yeah.
-Because I was fun

1346
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:10,000
to be around,
and I wanted them to win.

1347
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:12,137
And what I felt like
these three just said is,

1348
00:58:12,241 --> 00:58:13,655
"You're the water boy.

1349
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:16,068
"You're not gonna help us
in the challenges,

1350
00:58:16,172 --> 00:58:17,517
but you've got
a secret weapon."

1351
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,068
-BRANDON: For sure.
-You're likable.

1352
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:21,310
I will happily
be this team's water boy.

1353
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:22,896
I'm more than happy to do that.

1354
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,137
PROBST:
So, Emily, what case do you make

1355
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:28,206
in terms of "I could do better"?

1356
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,172
It's more like learning
from my mistakes.

1357
00:58:30,275 --> 00:58:32,379
And a lot of that is learning

1358
00:58:32,482 --> 00:58:34,448
to tone down
the more harsh qualities,

1359
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:36,344
um, for people
that I'm living with 24/7

1360
00:58:36,448 --> 00:58:38,793
and rebuilding trust.

1361
00:58:38,896 --> 00:58:40,344
You know, one of the things
that I did to rebuild trust

1362
00:58:40,448 --> 00:58:42,137
was I gave Sabiyah
my Shot in the Dark tonight.

1363
00:58:42,241 --> 00:58:43,827
And Sabiyah
was very kind and said,

1364
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:45,965
"I'll give it back to you
after Tribal."

1365
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:47,448
Now, that could be,
"Because you're not coming back

1366
00:58:47,551 --> 00:58:48,965
"to camp after Tribal,

1367
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:50,724
so it doesn't really matter,"
or that could also be

1368
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,379
Sabiyah saying,
"Look, Emily, I trust you, too."

1369
00:58:53,482 --> 00:58:56,896
PROBST:
So, Emily, if this is it,

1370
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,689
what's it been about?

1371
00:58:58,793 --> 00:59:01,275
EMILY:
Well, it's certainly not
gone the way I expected,

1372
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:02,620
and I can tell you right now
that I've learned

1373
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:04,103
a lot about myself,
I can tell you

1374
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:06,034
right now that I think I've made
friends for life. I never

1375
00:59:06,137 --> 00:59:08,068
thought I'd say that
after spending five days

1376
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:09,517
with strangers.
You know,

1377
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,379
I was told coming into this
that I can be

1378
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:14,034
a little bit aggressive,
uh, but all of those things

1379
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:15,931
in my everyday life,
I think, are very muted.

1380
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:17,931
I mean, I live a very
normal life, believe it or not.

1381
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:19,931
I have friends,
believe it or not. I mean...

1382
00:59:20,034 --> 00:59:22,931
And so, coming into
this scenario and seeing all

1383
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:24,517
of these things on hyperdrive
and then potentially

1384
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,482
re-watching them on TV,
I think that is going to be

1385
00:59:27,586 --> 00:59:29,068
a somewhat
traumatic experience.

1386
00:59:29,172 --> 00:59:31,068
You know, it's interesting
what you just said,

1387
00:59:31,172 --> 00:59:33,413
that, "I have friends,
believe it or not."

1388
00:59:33,517 --> 00:59:35,413
-I wouldn't doubt
you have friends.
-No.

1389
00:59:35,517 --> 00:59:37,413
What I think is interesting
about Survivoris

1390
00:59:37,517 --> 00:59:39,689
that they aren'tyour friends.

1391
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:41,655
Our friends don't always
tell us the truth,

1392
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:44,379
but out here,
people will tell you.

1393
00:59:44,482 --> 00:59:46,586
And if you take that,
you can shift how

1394
00:59:46,689 --> 00:59:49,137
you interact with the world.
That's what I feel like

1395
00:59:49,241 --> 00:59:51,413
is happening tonight.
All right, Brandon,

1396
00:59:51,517 --> 00:59:53,413
if this is it for you,
what's it been about?

1397
00:59:54,482 --> 00:59:57,275
My journey started
in September of 2008.

1398
00:59:57,379 --> 00:59:59,482
You know, my sixth grade teacher
mentioned Survivor.

1399
00:59:59,586 --> 01:00:01,000
I didn't think she liked me,
so I watched it

1400
01:00:01,103 --> 01:00:02,827
'cause I'm a kiss-ass,
'cause I wanted her to like me

1401
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:03,931
so I could talk
about it with her.

1402
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,103
And every day since that night,

1403
01:00:05,206 --> 01:00:06,241
I wanted to be here.

1404
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:07,448
I pictured myself here.

1405
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,689
This is everything that I'm not.

1406
01:00:09,793 --> 01:00:11,827
I don't like the outside.
I hate the beach.

1407
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:15,517
These challenges are so out
of my realm, and if this is it,

1408
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,517
I hope I learn
why I needed to come here.

1409
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,103
And I think that
it's not for this game.

1410
01:00:19,206 --> 01:00:20,448
It's outside of it.

1411
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:21,793
I'm so anxious, Jeff.

1412
01:00:21,896 --> 01:00:23,206
I am wildly anxious.

1413
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:26,068
I... My whole five days here
have been ruled

1414
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:28,344
by my anxiety and my neuroses
and worrying.

1415
01:00:28,448 --> 01:00:30,344
But being on the beach
with these guys,

1416
01:00:30,448 --> 01:00:32,689
with these Buffs--
it's incredible, man.

1417
01:00:32,793 --> 01:00:34,793
This is the most fun
five days I've ever had.

1418
01:00:34,896 --> 01:00:37,862
This is what I waited for.
And if this is how it ends,

1419
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:39,965
I would have waited 40
more years to do Survivor45

1420
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:42,379
with these guys, no doubt.

1421
01:00:42,482 --> 01:00:44,379
PROBST:
Well, the two of you remind me

1422
01:00:44,482 --> 01:00:49,413
tonight that Survivor
is always a unique experience

1423
01:00:49,517 --> 01:00:51,517
for every single person
who plays.

1424
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,448
Sadly, that adventure
is going to come to an end

1425
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:57,275
for one of you
'cause it is time to vote.

I'll go tally the votes.

1429
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:02,379
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol

1430
01:02:02,482 --> 01:02:05,655
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:09,862
Okay, I'll read the votes.

1432

That's two. That's enough.

1436
01:02:28,862 --> 01:02:30,551
Need to bring me your torch.

1437
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,103
All right, I want hugs.

1438
01:02:35,206 --> 01:02:37,310
-Come on. Hug, please.
-Yeah, of course.

1439

-BRANDON: Before
I get out of here,

01:02:39,206 --> 01:02:41,413
I just want to thank you

1441
01:02:41,517 --> 01:02:43,034
to meet amazing people,

1442
01:02:43,137 --> 01:02:45,448
play this game,

1443
01:02:49,344 --> 01:02:51,689
Brandon, the tribe has spoken.

1444
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,275
Oh.

1445
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:55,517
This is cool. It's really cool.

I might have lost Survivor,
but I did it. I didn't give up.
