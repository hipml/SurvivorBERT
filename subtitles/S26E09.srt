FACT THAT I'M GOING TO BE FLUNG

334
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,263
DOWN SOME WATERFALL ON A ROPE, I

335
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:21,889
DON'T EVEN KNOW THE MECHANICS OF

00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,056
IT.

337
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,808
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,486
LIFE SO I KIND OF THREW CAUTION

345
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,904

00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,199
JUMP DOWN THE THING LIKE JAMES

347
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:40,408
BOND.

348
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,576
IT WORKED OUT KIND OF WELL FOR

349
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:42,743
ME.

350
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,328

352
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,998
DOWN THE WATERFALL.

353
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,125
IT WASN'T MUCH CONSOLATION

354
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,376
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY

355
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,503
WERE DOING BUT I'M LEARNING TO

356
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:52,795
EMBRACE IT.

357
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,296
THIS IS THE SAME GUY THAT WAS

358
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,881
AFRAID TO TAKE OFF HIS SHIRT THE

359
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,591
LAST TIME I PLAYED "SURVIVOR."

360
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,302
NOW I'M FLYING DOWN A WATERFALL

361
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,470
AFTER WINNING A CHALLENGE.

362
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,263
IT WAS FANTASTIC.

363
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,223

NERVE-WRACKING.

365
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,808
I KIND OF SLID ON SOME MOSSY

367
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,020

(BELCHING)

380
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,301
IT'S JUST SIMPLE, IT'S PURE.

381
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,802
EVERYTHING'S GOTTEN SO

382
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,555
COMPLICATED OUT HERE IT WAS A

383
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,514
GREAT REPRIEVE FOR ALL OF US.

384
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,975
>> THE LAST FANS VERSUS FAVORITE

385
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,393
WAS DOMINATED BY WOMEN IN THE

386
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:49,560
END.

387
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,895
HOW COOL WOULD IT BE IF IT WAS

388
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,188
DOMINATED BY GUYS.

389
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,399
>> HOPE'S GONE SO THERE'S NOBODY

390
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,650
WORTH (BLEEP)ING ANYWAYS.

00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,406
WE'RE A UNITED BLOCK.

THE PITCH TO COCHRAN WAS LET'S

395
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,409
TAKE THE MUSCLE TO THE END.

396

LET DEESE THIS ALL GUY'S

397
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:07,703
ALLIANCE.

00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,038
LET'S BRO DOWN, GET THE SCHEMING

399
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,331
CRAZY GIRLS THAT KEEP FLIRTING

00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,166
WITH ALL OF US OUT OF HERE AND

401
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,626
TAKE THE STRONG GUYS TO THE END.

402
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,044
>> "SURVIVOR" IS ALL ABOUT WHO'S

403
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,588
-- YOU KNOW, A HANDFUL OF

404
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,631
LEGENDARY MOVES PEOPLE HAVE

405
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,298
NEVER FORGOTTEN.

406
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,674
YOU WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM.

407
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,967
>> "SURVIVOR" BIG MOMENTS.

408
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,802
I LIKE THAT.

409
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,929
>> REYNOLD, EDDIE AND MICHAEL

410
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,848
MUST NOT KNOW ME IF THEY THINK

411
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,099
THAT EMPHASIZING THE

412
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:29,850
TESTOSTERONE UNITY BETWEEN US

413
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,353
AND WE'RE MEN, WE'RE MEN AND WE

414
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,979
WAIT WOMEN AND WE'RE GOING TO

415
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,689
SLAP EACH OTHER WITH TOWELS IN

416
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,233
THE LOCKER ROOM AND CHUG BEERS.

417
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,400
THAT DOESN'T WORK WITH ME.

418
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,069
THAT DOESN'T APPEAL TO ME AT

419
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:40,236
ALL.

420
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,448
>> ALL RIGHT US!

421
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,369
I WON'T BE ENGAGING IN ANY

422
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,870
MASCULINE TOM FOOLERY WITH THESE

423
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:57,002
NUMSKULLS.

424
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:02,591
>> WELL, WE TRIED.

425
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,009
>> WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE,

426
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,511
WE DON'T NEED A PARANOIA DAY.

427
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,263
>> WE LOSE THE REWARD-- SAW IT

428
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,139
COMING A MILE AWAY, GOT OVER

429
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,099
PRETTY QUICK BECAUSE WHILE I

430
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,767
DIDN'T GET TO GO ON A REWARD I

431
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,393
WAS WITH THE PEOPLE I NEEDED TO

432
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,477
BE AROUND.

433
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,145
I NEED NUMBERS AND IT'S EASIEST

434
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,522
TO SCOOP UP THE PEOPLE ON THE

435
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,147
BOTTOM AND SHERRI AND DAWN SEEM

436
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,275
LIKE THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATES

437
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,860
TO ME.

438
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,612
WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM.

439
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,449
BEST CASE IF WE STAY IS THAT

440
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,077
MIKE, REYNOLD AND EDEDLY GO

441
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,286
FIRST.

442
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,621
IF WE DO IT WE DON'T REALLY NEED

443
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:32,955
MORE THAN FIVE.

444
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,625
IF THEY THINK WE'RE IN ON IT

445
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,670
THEY'LL SPLIT THE VOTE: FOUR

446
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,338
REYNOLD; FOUR EDDIE AND THEN

447
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,923
WE'RE GUARANTEED FINAL FIVE.

448
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:43,465
>> FAVORITES THINK THEY HAVE

449
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,383
EIGHT PEOPLE.

450
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,884
THEY THINK IT'S THE SEVEN

451
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:46,510
REMAINING FAVORITES AND THEY'VE

452
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,928
BROUGHT IN SHERRI FOR EIGHT

453
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,639
AGAINST THREE WHICH WOULD BE

454
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,099
MIKE, REYNOLD AND EDDIE.

455
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,810
I'M OEUPBG TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

456
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:55,352
THAT BECAUSE IF THEY GO WITH

457
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,646
THAT AND I CAN PULL IN A

458
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,480
FIVE-PERSON ALLIANCE THAT'S

459
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,107
ENOUGH TO TAKE OVER THE GAME.

460
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,442
WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM.

461
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:01,900
>> RIGHT.

462
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,943
>> IF WE ARE GOING TO DO

463
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,903
SOMETHING IT HAS TO BE NOW.

464
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,697
>> YEAH, BUT HOW?

465
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,950
>> THERE'S SIX PEOPLE IF YOU'RE

466
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:10,117
IN.

467
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,163
>> YOU'RE SAYING USE THE FOUR

468
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:14,371
FANS --

469
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,165
>> THEY'RE ALREADY IN, SHERRI

470
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,833
JUST AGREED.

471
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,334
BUT WE ALL HAVE TO DO IT.

472
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,085
>> RIGHT.

473
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,504
MALCOLM'S COME TO ME AND SAID

474
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,839
HERE'S HOW I WANT TO VOTE.

475
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:24,340
HERE'S WHO I'LL WORK WITH.

476
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,342
DO YOU WANT TO COME ON BOARD?

477
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,468
AND I'M THINKING HE'S GOING TO

478
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,969
BE A PROBLEM.

479
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,763
LET ME TALK TO SHERRI, LET ME

480
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,181
THINK AND THEN TALK TO YOU.

481
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,265
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I COULD

482
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,850
GIVE HIM THE IMPRESSION I WAS

483
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,185
VOTING WITH HIM AND WE COULD ALL

484
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,606
JUST TAKE HIM OUT.

485
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,190
MALCOLM APPROACHED ME AND SAID

486
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,234
HE HAS FOUR GUYS AND ME, THAT'S

487
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:44,985
WHAT THEY NEED.

488
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,986
AND THE WAY THEY WOULD WANT TO

489
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,030
DO IT WOULD BE THAT YOU GUYS

490
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,115
WOULD SPLIT THE VOTES FOR EDDIE

491
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,534
AND REYNOLD AND THAT WE WOULD

492
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:52,826
HAVE FIVE.

493
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,745
>> HE'S TRYING TO FLIP IT.

494
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,205
>> DID HE SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?

495
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,873
>> YEAH, HE WANTS ME TO FLIP

496
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:58,374
WITH SHERRI.

497
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:58,582
>> WHAT?

498
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,416
>> YUP.

499
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,125
>> I THINK WE TELL HIM WE'RE

500
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,544
SPLITTING THE VOTES, WE MAKE HIM

501
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,713
THINK THAT HE'S PULLING THIS

502
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,339
GREAT BLIND SIDE, HE'S GOING TO

503
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,007
THINK HE'S AMAZING.

504
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,218
>> WHICH MEANS SHERRI AND I HAVE

505
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:09,635
TO GO ALONG.

506
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,762
>> YOU TELL HIM WE'RE GOING

507
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,472
ALONG WITH IT, WE ALL JUST VOTE

508
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:13,764
MALCOLM OUT.

509
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,474
>> MALCOLM HAS BEEN TRYING TO

510
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,392
PLAY DOUBLE DUTY.

511
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,060
HE'S BEEN TRYING TO PLAY ME AS

512
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,019
IF HE WAS STILL PART OF THE CORE

513
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:19,269
ALLIANCE.

514
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,814
ME, THE SPECIALIST.

515
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,731
>> WHAT'S THE WORD?

516
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,109
>> WE'RE GOING TO DO A SPLIT FOR

517
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,110
EDDIE AND REYNOLD.

518
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,069
HE'S GOING TO BE THINKING WE'RE

519
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,780
VOTING FOR REYNOLD AND EDDIE

520
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,115
WHEN, IN FACT, WE'RE GOING TO BE

521
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,200
VOTING FOR HIM.

522
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,769
NOTHING TO DO IT'S KIND OF NICE

523
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,148
TO GET AWAY AND I FELT LIKE I

524
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,065
WAS A LITTLE KID SNEAKING OUT

525
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,526
FROM MY PARENTS' HOUSE AGAIN

526
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,570
WHEN EDDIE AND I WENT TO THE

527
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,655
LAGOON AND EDDIE'S REALLY HOT

528
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,323
SO, LIKE, MAYBE WE'RE DATING, I

529
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,241
DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ISLAND

530
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,159
DATING, I'M NOT SURE.

531
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,494
BUT THE MORE I PLAY UP THIS

532
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,329
POSSIBLE EDDIE RELATIONSHIP THE

533
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,414
MORE LIKELY HE IS TO MAYBE VOTE

534
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,376
FOR ME IN THE END OR GIVE ME

535
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:24,668
INFORMATION.

536
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,878
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING.

537
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,545
>> ABOUT WHAT?

538
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,797
>> I MEAN, I'LL DO WHATEVER I

539
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,299
NEED TO DO, I GUESS, IS WHAT I'M

540
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,675
SAYING.

541
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,677
WELL, EXCEPT FOR VOTE OUT

542
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:33,927
REYNOLD.

543
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:34,511
>> YOU PROMISE?

544
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,345
>> PROMISE WHAT?

545
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,138
>> YOU'LL VOTE THE WAY I SAY?

546
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:44,563
>> YEAH.

547
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:44,772
WHAT?

548
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,147
>> I DON'T KNOW.

549
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,647
>> I'M NOT PLAYING YOU.

550
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,482
>> YEAH.

551
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,442

GET RID OF THE THREE FANS.

WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER

555
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,031
THAT WITH YOU?

556
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,073
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

557
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,283
>> UH-HUH.

558
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,578
I TRUST YOU BUT I DON'T TRUST

559

THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE WITH

560
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,163
YOU.

561
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,289
>> I'M SAYING I COULD BE AN

562
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,248

568
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:10,714
WHAT'S TROUBLING TO ME IS I

569
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,549
DON'T THINK ANDREA WANTS TO VOTE

570
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,175

571
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,760
I THINK SHE WANTS TO KEEP ME

572
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:14,968

573
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,678
I THINK SHE LIKES ME AND I THINK

574
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,304
SHE REALLY DOES WANT TO DRAG ME

575
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,223
ALONG IN THIS GAME AND I JUST

576
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,516
NEED TO BE DRAGGED TWO OR THREE

577
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,141
MORE VOTES BEFORE I CAN GET UP

578
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,519
ON MY OWN FEET AND START

579
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:23,852
PUNCHING PEOPLE.

580

>> I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING

581
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,021
ABOUT IDOLS.

00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,357
>> HONESTLY?

584
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,066

585
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:29,525

SUGGESTING AND JUST TO ME I CAN

588
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,197
AT LEAST GUARANTEE THAT NEXT

589
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,990
VOTE WON'T BE YOU AND THEN WE

590
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,450
CAN WORK VOTE TO VOTE AND I CAN

591
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,202
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SNEAK

592
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,413
YOU BY.

593
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,289
I'D VOTE FOR YOU IF YOU'RE IN

FOR.

598
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,545
>> SERIOUSLY, YOU DON'T KNOW.

599
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,254
I DON'T KNOW WHO GOES OUT HERE

600
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,548
AND ACTUALLY FALLS FOR SOMEONE.

601
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,925
THAT'S REALLY RARE.

602
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:55,551
NORMALLY THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF

603
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,718
PLAYING SOMEBODY.

604
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,554

>> YOU HAD ONE LEG THROUGH.

772
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,870
YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU WAS ON A

773
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,162
VACATION.

774
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:21,788
I'M JUST KICKING BACK HERE,

775
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,331

TURNING POINT IN THE GAME THAT

00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:26,751
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

779
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,462
IT'S THE LAST TIME THAT I

780
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,338
DEFINITELY CAN'T HAVE THE

781
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,298
NUMBERS ON MY SIDE.

782
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,466
I WAIT ANY LONGER, REYNOLD,

783
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,759
EDDIE, MIKE ARE GOING TO BE

784
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:34,968
GONE.

785
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,303
THEY'RE EASY PICKINGS FOR VOTES

786
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:36,553
RIGHT NOW.

787
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,471
THE FAVORITES HAVE TO THINK I'M

788
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,055
100% WITH THEM OR THEY'RE NOT

789
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,598
GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTE.

790
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,725
SO I'VE SAT ON THE BOTTOM FOR 25

791
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,185
DAYS AND I'M GOING TO MAKE MY

00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:44,477

793
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,687
>> SO IT'S FOUR GIRLS AND

794
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,814
REYNOLD, FOUR GUYS AND EDDIE AND

00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:48,732
WE GET REYNOLD.

796
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,317
>> BUT ON THE SECOND VOTE --

797
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,152
>> IT'S REYNOLD NO MATTER WHAT.

798
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,361
>> REYNOLD NO MATTER WHAT.

799
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:57,365
>> I'M SO TIRED.

800
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:57,782
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

801
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,533
>> WE'RE GOOD.

802
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,618
>> RAN OFF, HAD A CHAT WITH

803
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:00,869
ANDREA.

804
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,330
SHE'S CALLING THE SHOTS, I NEED

805
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,332
HER TO THINK I'M ON BOARD WITH

806
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,416
HER PLAN AND HER TRUSTING ME

807
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,543
WITH THAT PLAN MEANS SHE DOESN'T

808
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,044
SUSPECT WHAT'S GOING ON.

809
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,879
WHAT I HAVE UP MY SLEEVE.

810
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,796
>> MALCOLM'S A GOOD LIAR.

811
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,882
I'M LYING TO HIM; HE'S LYING TO

812
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,049
ME.

813
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,843
JUST THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC OF IT IS

814
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,218
PRETTY HILARIOUS.

815
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,347
NOW HE'S TRYING TO PULL DAWN

816
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,765
OVER AND DAWN IS WORKING IT.

817
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,767
DAWN IS THE M.V.P. OF THE -- I

818
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,352
DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS DAWN CAME

819
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:25,560
FROM.

820
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,936
AFTER NEW DAWN IS -- SHE'S GOOD

821
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,437
AT THIS.

822
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,231
>> OKAY, YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT

823
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:30,482
FILL TRIP?

824
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:30,982
>> NO.

825
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,400
>> WHO DO YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT?

826
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,360
>> ANDREA.

827
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:33,777
>> OKAY.

828
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,862
>> ANDREA IS THE LEADER OUT

829
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:36,071
HERE.

830
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,322
AS MUCH AS PHILLIP HAS BLUSTER

831
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,698
AND AS MUCH AS THESE GUYS ARE

832
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,783
UPSET WITH HIM, HE'S NOT RUNNING

833
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,743
THINGS, HE'S KIND OF A JOKE.

834
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,371
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO STIR A POT

835
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:44,954
INSIDE A REBELLION, YOU DON'T

836
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,540
KILL THE PRINCE, YOU KILL THE

837
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,166
PERSON ACTUALLY RUNNING THE SHOW

838
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,709
WHICH IS ANDREA.

839
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,044
I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME TO THE

840
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:51,211
END.

841
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,171
IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW WE DON'T

842
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:53,880
HAVE THE CHANCE AND REYNOLD HAS

843
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,006
AN IDOL.

844
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,425
>> IF YOU SHOW ME THE IDOL THEN

845
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,760
I'LL DO IT.

846
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,053
BUT I'M NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE

847
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,096
TO LOOK IN THE EYE AGAIN.

848
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,931
>> I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU

849
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,264
TONIGHT.

850
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,099
>> OKAY, OKAY.

851
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,517
IT'S NUT IT IS FACT THAT I'M

852
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,851
COMING BACK AFTER CORRINE'S VOTE

853
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,811
AND MALCOLM IS STILL TRUSTING ME

854
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,937
WHEN I'M THE PERSON THAT GAVE

855
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,564
THE INFORMATION ON CORRINE TELLS

856
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,150
ME THAT HE'S NOT DIALED IN.

857
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,860
>> WE'RE GOOD.

858
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,533
>> AND THEN DO WE KNOW IF

859
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,534
THEY'RE GOING SPLIT THE VOTE?

860
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,993
>> THEY'RE DEFINITELY SPLITTING

861
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:24,494
THE VOTE.

862
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,662
>> BETWEEN WHO?

863
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,079
>> YOU AND EDDIE.

864
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,872
DOESN'T MATTER, THOUGH, THEY

865
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,793
HAVE FOUR ME AND DAWN WITH WITH

866
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,336
YOU, DONE, NO IDOL HAS TO BE

867
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,629
PLAYED SHE JUST WANTS TO KNOW

868
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,630
THAT WE HAVE IT BECAUSE THE NEXT

869
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,548
VOTE WILL BE HARRY.

870
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,799
>> WHO ARE WE VOTING?

871
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,967
>> ANDREA.

872
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,260
>> YES!

873
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,594
ANDREA.

874
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:41,803
OKAY.

875
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,804
>> GIVE ME A HAND SHAKE ON IT.

876
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:48,810
>> ALL RIGHT.

877
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:59,446
>> THERE'S ROOM FOR ONE MORE.

878
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,698
I JUST HAVE LESS ABILITY TO MOVE

879
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:01,906
OVER.

880
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,157
>> YEAH.

881
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,495
>> OH, MY GOSH, I'M SO BEAT.

882
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,832
ALL RIGHT, COOL.

883
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,252
YOU'RE AMAZING.

884
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,964
>> IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH I

885
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:22,594
GO HOME TONIGHT.

886
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,136
SO DON'T SCREW ME.

887
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:23,845
>> I KNOW THAT.

888
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,638
>> IF I HAVE REASON TO DOUBT YOU

889
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,098
I'M GOING TO PLAY IT FOR MYSELF

890
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:27,348
TONIGHT.

891
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,016
>> RIGHT.

892
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:34,689
NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

893
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:35,982
I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE THAT

894
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:36,900
INTIMIDATE OTHER PEOPLE AND I

895
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,777
THINK REYNOLD IS USED TO BEING

896
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,987
IN CONTROL AND GETTING WHAT HE

897
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,905
WANT BUT HE DID SHOW ME THE

898
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,531
IDOL, WHICH IS HUGE.

899
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,158
I MEAN NOW I HAVE MORE

900
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,367
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO VOTE

901
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,660
AND WHAT TO DO.

902
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,995
BUT, I MEAN, HE LOOKED OVER AND

903
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,247
SAID "IF YOU BURN ME YOU'LL HAVE

904
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,040
HELL TO PAY."

905
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:52,832
AND I FEEL LIKE SHAME ON YOU,

906
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,210
SHOULD HAVEN'T SHOWN ME YOUR

907
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,128
IDOL.

908
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,421
SHAME ON YOU, MALCOLM.

909
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,215
YOU SHOULD HAVEN'T BROUGHT ME

910
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:00,673
IN.

911
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,634
>> SHE SAT DOWN -- I SAT DOWN

912
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,010
NEXT TO HER, I SHOWED HER THE

913
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:04,219
IDOL.

914
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:04,844
>> OH, OKAY.

915
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,097
>> AND SHE SAID "OKAY."

916
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,807
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M NERVOUS

917
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,016
ABOUT.

918
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,185
>> YEAH, OF COURSE.

919
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,895
>> NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH

920
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,062
IT.

921
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:14,604
>> RIGHT.

922
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,064
>> I'M GOING TO TALK TO ANDREA.

923
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,608
>> DUDE SHE CHANGES HER MIND

924
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,067
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

925
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,692
>> I KNOW.

926
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,152
>> SHE PROMISES YOU THE WORLD.

927
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,403
SHE'S DANGEROUS, DUDE.

928
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,071
YOU'RE GOING TO FALL INTO A TRAP

929
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:23,321
WITH HER.

930
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,739
>> I KNOW.

931
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,533
>> LET'S JUST GET HER OUT OF

932
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,075
HERE AND THEN COCHRAN WILL

933
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,786
PROBABLY WARM UP TO US AND BRO

934
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:35,250
DOWN WITH THE GUYS TO THE END.

935
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,626
>> ALL RIGHT.

936
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,505
>> IS THAT HAPPENING?

937
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:40,755
>> MAYBE.

938
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,131
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

939
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,550
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SPLITTING FOR

940
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,426
ME AND REYNOLD ONE OF US IS

941
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,760
GOING HOME.

942
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:46,886
>> I CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT YOU

943
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,346
AND REYNOLD.

944
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:48,596
>> WHY?

945
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,807
>> BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING WITH

946
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,808
REYNOLD I'M WORKING WITH YOU.

947
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,892
>> REYNOLD IS WORKING WITH ME.

948
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,727
>> I'M JUST SAYING IT'S NOT YOU.

949
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,312
>> WHO ARE YOU VOTING FOR?

950
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:56,688
I DON'T GET IT.

951
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,106
ARE YOU VOTING FOR MIKE?

952
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,523
>> MAYBE.

953
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,400
>> IF YOU TELL ME I'LL VOTE THAT

954
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,609
WAY AND I PROMISE YOU I WON'T

955
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,151
MAKE A MOVE.

956
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,070
>> 100% I CAN'T.

957
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,780
100% YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.

958
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,907
>> CAN YOU TELL ME IT'S MIKE OR

959
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,116
MALCOLM?

960
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,117
>> IT'S NOT MALCOLM.

961
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,993
>> IT IS REYNOLD?

962
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:10,952
>> DO YOU WANT TO BE SAFE OR

963
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:11,119
NOT?

964
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,121
>> I WANT TO BE SAFE BUT I DON'T

965
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,081
WANT TO LOSE REYNOLD.

966
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:15,290
WHAT?

967
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,791
>> JUST TRUST ME.

968
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,418
>> IF REYNOLD PLAYS AN IDOL

969
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,794
TONIGHT I GO HOME.

970
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:21,588
>> IS HE GOING TO PLAY AN IDOL.

971
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,714
>> I DON'T KNOW.

972
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,799
>> DOES HE HAVE AN IDOL.

973
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,050
>> SOMEBODY HERE DOES.

974
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,135
>> YOU SAID YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T

975
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,678
HAVE AN IDOL.

976
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,387
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

977
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,597
AS OF RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW

978
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:30,805
ANYMORE.

979
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,057
>> WELL IF MALCOLM REALLY IS

980
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,517
BETRAYING ME AND THINKS HE HAS

981
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,769
FIVE OR SIX IT COULD BE ME, I I

982
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:36,978
GUESS.

983
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,395
>> IT COULD BE YOU.

984
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,646
>> OR WHOEVER.

985
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,397
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

986
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,064
SO WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME IN?

987
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,109
>> IF MY NAME COMES UP LET ME

988
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:43,318
KNOW.

989
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,402
RIGHT NOW IT'S FINE.

990
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,528
>> IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT.

991
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:45,737
>> ME?

992
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,070
>> YEAH!

993
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,282
AND THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO RUN

994
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,325
AROUND WITH REYNOLD, WE'RE

995
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,160
TRYING TO AVOID THAT.

996
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,705
>> I'M GOING HOME TONIGHT!

997
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:59,000
THIS IS, LIKE, MALCOLM'S

998
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,501
TARGETING ME AND NOW I HAVE TO

999
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,463
THINK OF A WAY TO -- THERE'S AN

1000
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,841
IDOL SO I HAVE TO COME UP WITH A

1001
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,134
WAY TO CHANGE EVERYTHING UP AND

1002
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,511
I DON'T -- UGH.

1003
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,554
I MAY BE GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1004
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,014
>> OKAY, WHAT ARE WE CHANGING?

1005
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,391
>> WE HAVE TO GO WITH THE SAFE

1006
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,559
VOTE AND GO WITH MICHAEL.

1007
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,728
>> OKAY, IF YOU'RE IN DANGER,

1008
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:18,936
YEAH.

1009
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,104
I'M FINE DOING MICHAEL.

1010
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,439
FRANKLY, I WAS A LITTLE BIT

1011
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,107
TURNED OFF THAT ANDREA WAS SO

1012
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,108
WILLING TO ABANDON WHAT I THINK

1013
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,444
WAS THE SMARTEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE

1014
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,945
IN TAKING OUT MALCOLM TONIGHT.

1015
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,656
>> I MEAN, THE SAFEST BET EVER

1016
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,031
WOULD BE MICHAEL.

1017
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,574
>> I STILL LIKE MALCOLM.

1018
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,576
>> I KNOW BUT YOU'RE NOT -- I

1019
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,744
THINK I'M BEING TARGETED.

1020
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,412
>> SHE'S COMPLETELY CHANGED HER

1021
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,955
MIND NOW SUDDENLY WE HAVE TO GO

1022
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,581
FOR THE SAFE VOTE WHICH WOULD BE

1023
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,958
TO VOTE OUT MICHAEL BECAUSE

1024
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:41,959
MICHAEL, UNLIKE ANYBODY ELSE,

1025
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:42,543
HAS PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN

1026
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,796
IN TRIBAL COUNCIL NOT TO HAVE AN

1027
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,004
IDOL.

1028
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,214
>> WE ARE ABSOLUTELY -- ALL THE

1029
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,549
WORK I DID TODAY IS COMPLETELY

1030
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,175
DOWN THE DRAIN.

1031
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,010
ALL OF IT'S GOING TO BE GONE.

1032
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,220
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

1033
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,763
>> I PROMISE YOU MALCOLM DOESN'T

1034
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,430
HAVE THE IDOL.

1035
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,098
I FEEL LIKE IT'S OUR CHANCE TO

1036
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,183
TAKE MALCOLM OUT!

1037
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,686
LIKE WE HAD A CHANCE, WE HAD A

1038
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,561
PLAN, WE COULD HAVE TOLD

1039
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,979
EVERYBODY AND JUST DONE IT!

1040
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:02,480
>> I KNOW BUT IT WAS --

1041
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,858
>> I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE WORRIED

1042
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:06,442
BECAUSE EDDIE GOT INVOLVED AND

1043
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,236
MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE

1044
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,779
GOING HOME AND I'M TELLING YOU

1045
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,072
HE WASN'T IN CHARGE OF THAT

1046
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,074
VOTE, IT WAS HAPPENING!

1047
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,202
I FELT FEEL LIKE MY WHOLE GAME

1048
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:16,619
IS LOST NOW.

1049
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,663
>> IF YOU REALLY HONESTLY THINK

1050
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,206
THAT -- IF YOU HONESTLY -- IF

1051
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,167
YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT

1052
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,836
MALCOLM'S NOT GOING TO HAVE AN

1053
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,087
IDOL PLAYED ON HIM, IF WE'RE

1054
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,339
CHANGING THE PLAN TEN MINUTES TO

1055
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,091
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND IT'S JUST YOU

1056
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:30,591
AND ME DOING EVERYTHING --

1057
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,343
>> I FEEL LIKE THE THREE GUYS

1058
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,262
DON'T HAVE IMMUNITY TONIGHT WITH

1059
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,597
THAT ONE IDOL AND WE'RE THINKING

1060
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:36,973
MICHAEL.

1061
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:37,515
>> HONESTLY --

1062
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,267
>> I HAD SOMEONE SHOW ME AN IDOL

1063
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,643
TODAY.

1064
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,230
JUST TO PROVE THAT WE WERE SAFE.

1065
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,815
YOU KNOW?

1066
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,234
>> YEAH.

1067
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:53,448
I MEAN -- I MEAN, I CAN CHANGE

1068
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,533
IT.

1069
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,134
IT AS A GLIMMER OF HOPE THAT AT

1070
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,093
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL IT

1071
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,804
WASN'T A FAN THAT WAS VOTED OUT?

1072
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,722
IT WAS A FAVORITE?

1073
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,474
>> YES, I MEAN, I WAS A LITTLE

1074
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,517
IN SHOCK BUT ALSO I WAS, LIKE,

1075
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,144
OH, WELL, THIS IS WHAT I HAD

1076
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,605
HOPED WOULD HAPPEN, SOME OF THE

1077
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,898
FAVORITES WOULD START TO SEE

1078
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,858
EACH OTHER AS THREATS AND START

1079
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,945
TO USE SOME OF THE FANS

1080
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:33,571
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DIDN'T USE ME

1081
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,323
FOR THAT VOTE BUT THEY CAN USE

1082
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:42,121
ME FOR OTHER VOTES.

1083
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:42,747
>> BUG.

1084
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,916
>> THANK YOU.

1085
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,334
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, WHAT DO YOU

1086
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,251
SEE GOING ON AT CAMP?

1087
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,212
>> WELL, FROM THE BEGINNING

1088
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,213
FAVORITES GOT TOGETHER AND WE

1089
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,048
DECIDED THAT WE WOULD DEVELOP A

1090
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,759
STRATEGY AND THAT STRATEGY

1091
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,135
INCORPORATED STEALTH "R" US.

1092
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,762
A VERY EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION,

1093
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,890
SOMETHING THAT I INTRODUCED IN

1094
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:05,311
SEASON 22 "SURVIVOR" REDEMPTION

1095
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:05,520
ISLAND.

1096
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,313
AND WE HAVE A NEWER MEMBER, A

1097
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,149
VERY, VERY EFFECTIVE DOUBLE

1098
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,859
AGENT WHO'S ABLE TO SHARE A

1099
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,485
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OPERATIVE

1100
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,529
INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF

1101
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,280
SHERRI AND HER NAME IS TENACITY.

1102
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,281
I GAVE HER THAT NAME BECAUSE SHE

1103
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,575
HAS A UNIQUE CAPABILITY OF

1104
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,160
HOLDING ON IN THIS GAME, MOST

1105
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,328
LIKELY MUCH FURTHER THAN ANY OF

1106
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,330
THE OTHER FANS.

1107
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,915
>> Jeff: MICHAEL, SO IT'S

1108
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,292
REALLY YOU, REYNOLD, AND EDDIE.

1109
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,335
SHERRI IS CLEARLY NOW A MEMBER

1110
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:29,710
OF STEALTH "R" US.

1111
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,128
>> YEAH.

1112
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,630
>> YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THEY ALL

1113
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,383
VOTED FOR ME, ALL MY T FANS

1114
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,134
WROTE MY NAME DOWN.

1115
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,304
PAYBACK'S A BITCH.

1116
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,556
>> Jeff: EDDIE, CONCERN YOU?

1117
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,307
>> IT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME

1118
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,767
THAT MUCH NOW TO BE HONEST.

1119
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,393
I'M ONE OF THREE TO GO ANYWAY

1120
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,479
AND I'D RATHER PLAY MY OWN GAME

1121
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,064
THAN BE SOMEBODY ELSE'S PUPPET

1122
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:52,567
OR IN THEIR LITTLE LEAGUE OF

1123
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:52,859
OPERATIVES.

1124
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:53,985
>> Jeff: REYNOLD, LITTLE

1125
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,278
CONCERNED ABOUT PHILLIP AND HIS

1126
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:55,570
OPERATIVES?

1127
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,948
>> IT'S EIGHT OPERATIVES AGAINST

1128
00:35:59,031 --> 00:35:59,574
THREE NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK THAT

1129
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,451
CAME IN TO THEIR HOME CAMP.

1130
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,995
>> Jeff: BUT IF SOMEBODY HAS

1131
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,580
AN IDOL ON THE ENEMY SIDE AND

1132
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,456
THINGS WORK OUT AND THEY PLAY IT

1133
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,416
AT THE RIGHT TIME IT COULD FLIP

1134
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,876
THE GAME.

1135
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,376
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

1136
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,336
>> EXCUSE ME, JEFF, WE ALREADY

1137
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,213
KNOW FROM MY PRIOR SEASON THAT I

1138
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,507
DISCUSSED THAT IF WE THINK YOU

1139
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,344
HAVE AN IDOL YOU WILL BE VOTED

1140
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:20,511
FOR.

1141
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,304
>> Jeff: MICHAEL, LITTLE

1142
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:21,596
CONCERNED?

1143
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,306
>> AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW, I'M

1144
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,975
READY TO PLAY WITH SOMEBODY WHO

1145
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,809
ACTUALLY WANTS TO PLAY.

1146
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,227
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE SAYING IF

1147
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,438
AND WHEN THIS STEALTH "R" US

1148
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,273
BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN I'LL BE

1149
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:32,857
HERE SO --

1150
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,067
>> IT ALREADY HAS BEGUN TO BREAK

1151
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:35,276
DOWN.

1152
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,402
THEY VOTED OUT CORRINE BEFORE

1153
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,445
THEY VOTED OUT A FAN.

1154
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,280
>> WELL WE ALSO KNOW THAT FROM

1155
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,281
AGAIN -- I HATE TO KEEP

1156
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,409
REPEATING MYSELF, SEASON 22,

1157
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,368
REDEMPTION ISLAND THAT, IN FACT,

1158
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,203
A COALITION THAT STICKS TOGETHER

1159
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,455
ACTUALLY GETS TO THE END

1160
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:47,705
TOGETHER.

1161
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,749
>> Jeff: ANDREA, IS THAT THE

1162
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,291
BIG QUESTION?

1163
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,584
THAT, YEAH, WE CAN STEUG

1164
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,502
TOGETHER BUT WE CAN'T ALL GO TO

1165
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:53,753
THE END.

1166
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,255
SO AT SOME POINT SOMEONE WILL

1167
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,506
MAKE A MOVE AND WIN.

1168
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,634
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE

1169
00:36:59,717 --> 00:36:59,926
DILEMMA IS.

1170
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,427
FROM MY SEASON I WAS ON THE

1171
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,763
BOTTOM OF MY ALLIANCE, I DIDN'T

1172
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,723
KNOW IT AT THE TIME BUT IF YOU

1173
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,600
HAVE A SENSE THAT YOU'RE ON THE

1174
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,185
BOTTOM THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

1175
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,062
FLIP BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE THREE

1176
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,605
FANS AND MAYBE OTHERS AMONG THE

1177
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,898
STEALTH "R" US ORGANIZATION AS

1178
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,483
WELL THAT ARE READY TO MAKE

1179
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:21,489
MOVES AND TOTALLY CHANGE THE

1180
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:21,822
GAME.

1181
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,990
>> Jeff: SO WHEN ANDREA SAYS

1182
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,784
IF THE RIGHT PERSON GETS THE

1183
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,701
RIGHT NUMBERS AT THE RIGHT TIME

1184
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,786
THEY CAN CHANGE THE GAME.

1185
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,205
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, I FULLY

1186
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,539
EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN.

1187
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,374
BUT I BELIEVE AT THIS TIME IF

1188
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,584
SOMEONE WERE TO OPERATE RIGHT

1189
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,670
NOW WITH IMPUNITY AND DECIDE,

1190
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,796
WELL, THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME

1191
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,339
BECAUSE OF WHATEVER THEIR REASON

1192
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,423
IS I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO FIND

1193
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,883
THAT THEY ACTUALLY ERRED IN

1194
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:41,509
THEIR JUDGMENT BECAUSE THERE'S

1195
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,302
ENOUGH NUMBERS STILL LESS AND

1196
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,471
ENOUGH SMART PEOPLE STILL HERE

1197
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,889
THEY'LL FIGURE THAT OUT.

1198
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,183
SO WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS A BRAVE

1199
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,644
MOVE, YOU'LL GET FLUSHED OUT,

1200
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,771
GOOD-BYE.

1201
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,438
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1202
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,899
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1203
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:01,487
PHILLIP, YOU'RE UP.

1204
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,385
>> THIS IDEA WAS THIS WAS A

1205
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:24,760
THROWAWAY VOTE.

1206
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,386
AFTER PHILLIP'S LITTLE SPEECH I

1207
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,264
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

1208
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:28,514
ANYMORE.

1209
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,600
HOPEFULLY THINGS GO ACCORDING TO

1210
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:43,571
PLAN.

1211
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,415
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1212
00:38:54,498 --> 00:39:05,843
VOTES.

1213
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,012
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1214
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:08,637
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW

1215
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:16,270
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1216
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:21,275
>> HOLD UP.

1217
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,693
THEY ALL VOTED FOR ME.

1218
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,905
YOU CAN TELL, THAT WHOLE STORY

1219
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,823
WAS ABOUT, GIVE IT TO ME, I'M IN

1220
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:32,411
GOOD SHAPE.

1221
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,747
I'M BEING DEAD SERIOUS RIGHT

1222
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:34,914
NOW.

1223
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:49,762
>> YEAH.

1224
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,263
>> Jeff: SO REYNOLD GAVE HIS

1225
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:51,639
IDOL TO MALCOLM.

1226
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,974
ANY VOTES CAST FOR MALCOLM WILL

1227
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,725
NOT COUNT.

1228
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:59,105
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1229
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,484
FIRST VOTE, ANDREA.

1230
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,821

00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,783
ENOUGH, YOU NEED TO BRING ME

1246
00:40:52,867 --> 00:41:03,711
YOUR TORCH.

1247
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:08,299
MICHAEL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1248
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,049
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1249
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:18,684
>> YOU TURKEYS.

1250
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,060
>> Jeff: WELL, THERE ARE TEN

1251
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,730
VERY SALVERY PLAYERS LEFT AND

1252
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,400
ONLY ONE THING YOU CAN RELY ON,

1253
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:27,234
YOUR GUT.

1254
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,986
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

1255
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:29,195
CAMP.

1256
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,739
GOOD NIGHT.

"SURVIVOR."

>> Jeff: AS THE END GETS

1264
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,639
CLOSER, THE PRESSURE BUILDS.

1265
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,892
AND SOMEONE'S GOING TO BREAK.

1266
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,560
>> IT'S BAFFLING TO ME.

1267
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,020
SHE'S ACTING LIKE A LUNATIC.

1268
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,939
>> I'LL PULL MYSELF FROM THE

1269
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:09,985
GAME, I'M NOT KIDDING.

1270
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,697
>> IT HAS BEEN A LONG, STRANGE,

1271
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,990
WEIRD, DIFFICULT JOURNEY.

1272
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:15,616
IT'S OVER, WHAT CAN I SAY.

1273
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,910
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.

1274
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,037
I WANTED TO GO FAR AND DEEP INTO

1275
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,288
THE GAME AND I THOUGHT I COULD

1276
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,916
BUT THE FAVORITES ARE GREAT

1277
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:24,959
PLAYERS, THEY'RE TIGHT AND

1278
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,961
THEY'RE PLAYING HARD AND STRONG.

1279
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,255
I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BUST UP

1280
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,297
EVENTUALLY BUT HERE I AM.

1281
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,257
IT'S BUMMER.
