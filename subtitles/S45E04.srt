what he told us,

00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:02,379
But Katurah is on edge,
a little bit.

343
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:04,758
In that conversation
that we had,

344
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,655
in regards
to Brandon being voted out,

345
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:08,655
Katurah went like this to me,

346
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:11,586
and she said she wanted to hear
it from Kaleb, thinking that,

347
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:14,172
at some point in time,
I was lying to them.

348
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,275
I was already not
seeing eye to eye with Katurah,

349
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,413
but that was the final straw.

350
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,965
That's the foot
that you put in your own ass,

351
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,137
if you will,
and boot yourself out the door.

352
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:31,862
JAKE:
Day one on Sweat and Savvy,
I met Kaleb.

353
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,413
And he brought up,
when we hit the merge,

354
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,965
"Let's get something going."

355
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,068
[clicks tongue]

356
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:38,620
It's a little pre-baked,

357
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:40,103
but let's get
something going now, Kaleb.

358
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,344
But I got to be careful
of what Kaleb will do

359
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:43,896
with any information I give him.

360
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,103
I'd like to help him,

361
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:47,068
but I also don't
want him to bite my hand.

362
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:48,551
How are you feeling
with this group,

363
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:50,034
the four that you're with?

364
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:51,655
I feel good about Bruce.

365
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,586
-Like, I don't think
he's gonna come for me.
-Okay.

366
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:54,689
-You know what I mean?
-So that'd be somebody
you're good to, like...

367
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:56,275
That's... Yeah.

368
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:58,724
I mean, definitely, like,
I don't want to say a name yet.

369
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,758
-Like, I want to get a little
more comfortable with you.
-That's okay.

370
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:02,000
But, like, also...

371
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,793
You're locked or something
like that. Yeah, yeah...

372
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:08,310
-Yeah.
-That's fine.

373
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,034
Like, if you come back and say,
"Jake, maybe Kellie,

374
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,862
maybe Katurah," like,
I want me and you to be good.

375
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah.

376
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:15,586
I don't think that Jake overly

377
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,827
trusts me right now, but I think
he's open to a relationship.

378
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:20,068
He wanted me to know
that anybody was on the table,

379
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:21,896
which is, of course,
music to my ears.

380
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,413
If you do have conversations
with people that you know

381
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,000
more than I do, if you could,
like, please, obviously,

382
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,689
like, look out for me
or let me know if anyone...

383
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:29,896
-Yeah. That would be...
I'd really appreciate it.
-I want you at the merge.

384
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,206
Yeah.

385
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,103
Appreciate it, man.

JAKE:
You got to feel bad for Kaleb,
coming over here.

387
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:36,103
It's a tribe of five.

388
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:38,655
He's outnumbered four to one,
and now he's saying,

389
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,137
"Jake, I need you
to help me out."

390
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,931
And I'm like, "Yeah, you do."

391
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,482
This is an opportunity for me
to secure some more connections

392
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,862

more opportunities for myself.

We've got two Reba,

And then we found, like,
a really good

a lot of fish tonight.

I've been alone in this game,

it feels like
since the beginning.

420
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,517
So this feeling
of being on the outs,

421
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,413
it's not entirely new to me.

422
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:00,655
So my strategy coming
into this tribe is to play it

genuinely get to know people,

It's easy to say it,

fire represents life,

so it's breathing new life
back into my game. And it's

440
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,655
a little sigh of relief
for me, thinking this

441
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:39,689
could be me turning a new
chapter in the game of Emily.

442
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:43,655
So, I've been
on the outs of my tribe.

-Okay.
-Lulu camp was Sabiyah's camp.
[chuckles softly]

444
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,655
There's a lot of strategy
behind how I present myself

445
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:51,586
to this tribe. Kaleb
taught me a lot of lessons.

446
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:53,413
The main one being,
you know, take some time,

447
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:55,586
learn to get to know people
before you start taking actions.

448
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:59,068
And I get to start fresh
with entirely new people,

449
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,896
people who aren't familiar
with my previous game,

450
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,172
for the most part,

451
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,965
aren't familiar
with how I acted on Lulu,

452
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:05,241
and can kind of give me

453
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,931
a clean slate
to move forward with.

454
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:09,620
As we're going down
this mess that was yesterday--

455
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:11,137
-Yeah.
-everybody scrambling,
trying to figure out

456
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:12,620
where the votes are going.

457
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:14,103
Sabiyah pulls me aside
and she pulls out this giant

458
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,931
wax figure and she says,
"Emily, I have an idol.

459
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,034
My idol's in here,
and I have to burn it."

460
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,034
I'm afraid that sharing
this information could paint me

461
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:24,206
a bit as an easy target, but
I want the tribe to perceive me

462
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,724
as genuine, honest and truthful.
"She has

463
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:28,310
"no secrets, so moving forward,

464
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:30,862

trust and put our faith in."

different than I thought.

built up as this, like, mean...

469
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:44,206
...cruel, browbeating lady,

470
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,931
and she's pretty normal,
you know?

471
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:48,310

the other side of the story.

-DREW: Wow.

-You're not bad. Yeah.

-You're a natural.
-DREW: The new Belo tribe

475
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,034

because it is the only tribe

476

from all three previous tribes.

477
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,068

that I can
wiggle my little way into?

510
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:18,689
Uh, so when there was a swap
today, I literally was, like,

511
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:20,931
thinking to myself,

512
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:24,103
the best thing that can happen
for me at this point is a swap.

513
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:25,413
Wow.

514
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,034
-And look what happened.
-And look what happened.

515
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:28,241
Manifest.

516
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:29,793
-JULIE: Wow.
-SIFU: You sure have.

517
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:31,068
-We're big
on manifestation, okay?
-SEAN: Yes.

518
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:32,379
J. MAYA:
I don't know what it is.

519
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:33,827
Sometimes you read
people's energy,

520
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:35,482
and you're like, "I like you."

521
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,034
And I'm ecstatic
to have Sean on Reba.

522
00:21:38,137 --> 00:21:41,137
I feel like he brings
this amazing positive energy.

523
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,310
So, Sean is fresh potential.

524
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:46,655
Maybe he will prove to be
a really loyal ally

525
00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:48,000
and be a great contender

526
00:21:48,103 --> 00:21:49,310
for someone to add
to our merge numbers.

527
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:55,241

00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:04,379
Do we think he really
doesn't have an idol?

533
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,586
If we have
to go through his bag,

534
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:08,000
we might have to do that.

535
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:10,827

Put this away. Go get it.

539
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:18,137
I like Sean,
and I do think that him and I,

540
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:20,000
the more that we get together,
I do think we're gonna click.

541

But right now,

542
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,413
Sean could potentially
have an advantage or an idol.

543
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,758
So we go to open his bag,
but we notice that the strings

544
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:33,344
in his bag are tied tight

545
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:34,413
and in a weird position.

546
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:35,896
They're all like this.

547
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,655

00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:38,758
"That means
he has to have something,

we got one of our red bags,

00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:51,655

how he tied it, and then we tied

He knows that he's
at the bottom of the tribe.

597
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:54,620
He's gonna play the idol

598
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:56,034
and then he's gonna
put one of our names down

599

00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,586
We wanted to work with,
because we thought that...

679
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:06,586
Literally,
the first time I saw...

680
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:08,206
the first time I saw y'all...
Okay, so,

681
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,620
-I don't want
to get ahead of myself,
-DREW: Okay.

682
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:10,793
but as somebody
who's been through the scramble

683
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:12,206
55 million times,

684
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,655
it's good to have a plan
before everything happens.

685
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:14,931
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Um...

686
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:16,482
If y'all are with me,
I'm with you.

687
00:28:16,586 --> 00:28:18,068
We've been playing a loyal game.
We have been.

688
00:28:18,172 --> 00:28:19,586
-Yeah.
-We are pretty
straight shooters, okay?

689
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:21,000
-We're not...
-EMILY: I'm 100%
a straight shooter.

690
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:23,137
-Okay. Oh...
-EMILY: I mean...

691
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:25,448
Stop, stop, stop.
Don't. No, stop.

692
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,344
Oh, I'm so happy.

693
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:34,482
EMILY:
Austin and Drew approached me
about, "This could be a thing.

694
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,000
"This could be an alliance,

695
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:37,689
"and we could be strong.
The three of us

696
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:39,034
could go to the end together."

697
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:41,586
And, I mean,
that's music to a girl's ears.

698
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,310
-We're just so happy.
-EMILY: No, no, no, no, no.

699
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:48,620
I feel like a commodity,
all of a sudden.

700
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:50,068
I feel like people
want to work with me

701
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:52,034
and actually making alliances

702
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:54,068
and voting together.
And they're not just

703
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:55,379
telling me what to do,
they're actually

704
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:56,862
including me
as part of the conversation.

705
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:59,068
So all of a sudden,
I feel this sense of autonomy

706
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:01,344
in this game of Survivor
that I've never felt before.

707
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,724
Literally,
the first time I met y'all,

708
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:04,000
I was just, like,
the vibes were good.

709
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:05,103
I wanted to work with you.

710
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:06,379
AUSTIN:
One hundred percent.

711
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:08,241
DREW:
Emily is a very rational person.

712
00:29:08,344 --> 00:29:11,241
She picks stocks for a living.
She analyzes.

713
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:14,689
And the rational decision
is to work with Austin and I.

714
00:29:14,793 --> 00:29:17,068
So we're hoping to win

715
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,551
the power struggle
against old Belo,

716
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:21,137
take charge with the core four

717
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:25,000
of Austin, myself,
Julie and Dee,

718
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:28,000
with probably the addition
of Emily, who we like a lot.

719
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:29,931
So I'm very hopeful.

720
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:31,965
Shut the front door.

721
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:34,068
♪ ♪

722
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,758
KELLIE:
Looking at the three new tribes,

723
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:50,206
I am extremely grateful
that I was playing the middle,

724
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,137
because if I got
swapped with all the girls,

725
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:53,517
I would be okay.

726
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,344
If I got swapped with the guys,
I would be okay.

727
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:57,793
I feel like I got
to keep my eye on Bruce,

728
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,896
but at this point,
I have to work with what I have,

729
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,034
and what I have right now
is Jake and Bruce.

730
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,206
You know what I'm saying?
So, because...

731
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,655
I'm gonna... We're gonna...

732
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:17,758
KELLIE:
Bruce wants to pull Kaleb in.

733
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:21,344
Bruce also just told me
that I'm his number one.

734
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,862
Do I fully believe that?
I don't know.

735
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:25,896
But it's good to hear.

736
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,448
So nice to finally
hang out with you guys, eh?

737
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:29,827
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

738
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:32,000
-Happy to see you, man.
-Yeah.

739
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:38,034
KALEB: Yeah.

740
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:40,137
It is kind of obviously
scary being on the bottom

741
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,413
-when the numbers are four-one.
-Yeah.

742
00:30:41,517 --> 00:30:43,551
Of course.
Can't blame you on that one.

743
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:45,517
KALEB:
My hope is that...

744
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:53,034
KATURAH:
OnSurvivor, I have to
think about every single angle.

745
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:54,896
And when I see Kaleb

746
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,344
going away with Kellie
and Bruce, that tells you

747
00:30:58,448 --> 00:31:01,551
where we are
in terms of connection.

748
00:31:01,655 --> 00:31:04,758
So my plan
was to get Kaleb alone

749
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:08,344
and give him some information
on Bruce so that he sees Bruce

750
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:10,068
as a bigger threat
than what he is.

751
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,655
It was cool getting
to know everybody,

752
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:13,137
like, as a group, and, like,

753
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:16,241
you guys seem so, like, kumbaya.
You know what I mean?

754
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,965
-Yeah. I was like...
-No, I mean, the thing is...

755
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:31,551
KATURAH:
Bruce is annoying.

756
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,655
I mean, I made an alliance
with Bruce on day one.

757
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,344
I liked him.
I thought he was cool.

758
00:31:35,448 --> 00:31:36,965
Then, the more
he opened his mouth,

759
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:39,482
the more I was like, I just,
"This guy gets under my skin."

760
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:41,413
All of us can go back
and be like, "Yo, I was on TV.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:42,862
I was a big thing."

762
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:44,206
[high-pitched voice]:
"Now you weren't."

763
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,000
[regular voice]:
"Yeah, I was.

764
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:48,275
You can't even do your ABCs.
Look what I did." [laughs]

765
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:50,517
KATURAH:
You know, and it's like,

766
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,068
"Oh, Bruce, you're so lovable.

767
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:53,689
"You cracked your head
and we all got sad,

768
00:31:53,793 --> 00:31:55,275
and, yay, your head's fixed."

769
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,931
He only played Survivor
for 12 hours. Not a big deal.

770
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:00,482
He makes all these random
little faces and gestures.

771
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,758
"Bwee" and "Aah." "Blah."

772
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:04,724
Every time he talks to us
he calls us kids.

773
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:06,275
"When I was in the Navy SEALs,

774
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:09,241
and this is how we did it,
and this is my training, and..."

775
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,310
I don't know.
I'm annoyed by it.

776
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:14,172
I can see right through it.
I'm ready for him to go.

777
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:17,103
But I have to be realistic
that I was just on a tribe

778
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:19,172
with people
who didn't see that at all.

779
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:22,206
For me,
thinking about your safety,

780
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,068
unless you see
any bigger threat,

781
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:26,758
that might be the best way
for you to go.

782
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,000
KALEB:
The conversation with Katurah

783
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:31,000
was fast and very insightful.

784
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:32,931
I'm looking for somebody
that I can be like,

785
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,689
"All right,
we got the common goal.

786
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:36,241
Let's get to the merge."

787
00:32:36,344 --> 00:32:37,896
If we need to do something,

788
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,965
-we're gonna have
to make a move at some point.
-Yeah.

789
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:43,172
And I honestly believe
if we don't move against Bruce,

790
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,862
Bruce will move against us.

791
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,241
KALEB:
We were at the water well,

792
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:47,655
but I was no longer thirsty.

793
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,344
I was finally quenched.

794
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:51,034
Somebody was finally telling me
what's going on around here.

795
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:53,689
Knowing that Katurah and Bruce
might be at odds

796
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:55,896
tells me already where
some of the divisions might lie.

797
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,620
And I feel like
I finally am seeing

798
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,413
how this forest is shaping,

799
00:32:59,517 --> 00:33:01,206
and now it's time for me

800
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,103
to build the trail
that I'm gonna walk down.

801
00:33:03,206 --> 00:33:05,103
-[laughs]
-Look, I mean...

802
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:23,551
Come on in.

803
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:40,137
All right.

804
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,724
Shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

805
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:45,448
-[all voicing assent]
-PROBST: First things first:

806
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:48,034
got to take back the idols.
Thank you, Dee.

807
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:50,103
Thank you, Kendra.

808
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:57,931
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

809
00:33:58,034 --> 00:34:00,655
For today's challenge,
you're gonna swim out to a cage,

810
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:04,379
climb up and leap in.

811
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:07,034
You will then carry that cage

812
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:08,688
up the beach
where one tribe member

813
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:11,137
will have to dig out from under.

814
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,172
That person will be
your rebounder

815
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:15,310
as the rest of the tribe
attempts to shoot balls

816
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:17,620
into very tall baskets.

817
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:20,344
First two tribes
to get one ball in each

818
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,000
of their three baskets...

819
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:27,241
...wins immunity,
safe from the vote,

820
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:28,757
you're not going home.

821
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:30,896
Losers, Tribal Council where

822
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,551
somebody will be the fourth
person voted out of Survivor45.

823
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,447
And as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint,

824
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:38,793
sorry for you.

825
00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:42,068
Lulu, you are still fighting
to get yours

826
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:45,862
for the first time this season.

827
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:48,793
All right, give you a minute
to strategize, we'll get it on.

828
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:51,516
-Let's do it!
-Yeah!
-Let's go!

829
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:00,689
All right, here we go.

830
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:02,344
For immunity.

831
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:04,724
Survivors ready?

832
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,379
Go!

833
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:13,241
First, you got to get everybody
to the cage.

834
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:16,241
You can't start
getting into the cage until

835
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:17,965
all five tribe members

836
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:20,586
are at the cage.

837
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:23,482
Jake gets there quickly
for Lulu,

838
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:26,482
but you got
to get everybody there.

839
00:35:26,586 --> 00:35:27,896
-You're good, Reba!
-There you go then.

840
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,896
-PROBST: You're good, Belo!
-Go!

841
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,379
-PROBST: You're good, Lulu!
-[Katurah gasping]

842
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:34,551
Now it's up and over.

843
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:36,379
You've got to release two poles.

844
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:38,379
You need those poles

845
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:39,689
-to lift the cage.

This is what you dreamed about

00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:01,724
when you thought
about playing Survivor.

881
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:05,310
These kind of moments,
where you got to dig.

PROBST:
Lulu has not won an
immunity challenge this season.

Will a new set

00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:27,862
Big lead for Lulu right now.

Lulu digging now.
Everybody can dig.

904

Only one person needs
to go through.

Can you go on my other side?
It's stuck on that side.

Kellie goes to the second pole
for another ball.

925
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:49,241
Takes a lot of work just to get
somebody out of that cage.

926
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,689
Then they're gonna have to chase
down balls.

You want somebody
with some energy.

for Lulu.

Sifu scores for Reba.
That's one.

the Lulu tribe wins immunity.

992
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:35,965
Kaleb, I'm not sure
it's apples to apples

993
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:37,862
because it's not
the same tribe members,

994
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:39,862
but it is the same tribe color,
and that is all

995
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,862
you five care about.

996
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:45,034
There it is.
Immunity for Lulu, and...

997
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:46,724
Unbelievable.

998
00:41:46,827 --> 00:41:48,068
-...you've earned your flint
-JAKE: How you like that?

999
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,620
-after nine days.
-Finally got it.

00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,137
Once again, nobody going home.

1003
00:41:57,241 --> 00:42:00,620
Emily, what does that feel like?

1004
00:42:00,724 --> 00:42:03,103
Um, well, I tell you what,
I didn't earn it as much

1005
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:05,586
as these four did, but it still
feels great, nonetheless.

1006
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,586
Nobody going home from Belo.

1007
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:11,517
Lulu, grab your stuff, head out.
Enjoy the night off.

1008
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,931
-Well earned.
-KALEB: Wow. Wow.

1009
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:17,482
-Kaleb won't know
what to do with himself.
-[laughter]

1010
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:19,551
Belo, grab your stuff,
head out. No Tribal Council,

1011
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:22,000
nobody going home.

1012
00:42:24,344 --> 00:42:26,034
So, Reba,
obviously, for everyone

1013
00:42:26,137 --> 00:42:28,448
except Sean,
a new experience tonight.

1014
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:31,379
Dee, is there
any weird excitement

1015
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,413
about getting to go to Tribal?

1016
00:42:34,482 --> 00:42:36,689
There is no excitement
gonna Tribal.

1017
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:38,655
There's never excitement, but

1018
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:40,758
it is Survivor,and this is
what we signed up for.

1019
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:43,206
We expect to fail,
and, you know,

1020
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,758
we don't have as much muscle
as the other tribes,

1021
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:47,448
but we still were pretty close.

1022
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:49,448
So, no matter what happens
tonight,

1023
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:51,655
we put up a good fight,
and that's all that matters.

1024
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:53,689
All right, Reba,
Tribal Council tonight

1025
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:56,413
and as a penalty for losing,
I will take your flint.

1026
00:42:56,517 --> 00:42:59,172
Sorry for you.
Thank you, Sifu.

1027
00:42:59,275 --> 00:43:02,379
You'll get a chance to earn it
back at the next challenge.

1028
00:43:02,482 --> 00:43:05,034
All right, Reba, grab your
stuff, head out. See you tonight

1029
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:06,551
at Tribal Council,
where somebody will be

1030
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:10,241
the fourth person
voted out of Survivor45.

1031
00:43:10,344 --> 00:43:12,586
J. MAYA: This loss gives me
an opportunity

1032
00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:15,000
to make a big, beautiful,
bold move.

1033
00:43:15,103 --> 00:43:17,448
The second I step on the beach
after the challenge,

1034
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:20,551
it's my mission to convince
the girls to blindside Sifu

1035
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:22,965
and get him out tonight.

1036
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:34,931
-KALEB: Let's go! Come on!
-[cheering]

1037
00:43:35,034 --> 00:43:36,413
[whooping]

1038
00:43:36,517 --> 00:43:39,344
We reversed the Lulu curse!

1039
00:43:39,448 --> 00:43:41,000
-Yay!
-Let's go!

1040
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:42,620
BRUCE:
Didn't expect any less.

1041
00:43:42,724 --> 00:43:44,724
KALEB:
I can't believe
we won a challenge.

1042
00:43:44,827 --> 00:43:46,931
This is how I feel on the
inside. You know what I mean?

1043
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:48,689
A little... Right?

1044
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,241
And we finally had some
competent people on my tribe.

1045
00:43:51,344 --> 00:43:53,000
I don't need
to be on the Warriors, you know?

1046
00:43:53,103 --> 00:43:55,000
I can be Kawhi Leonard.
Just put me on the Raptors.

1047
00:43:55,103 --> 00:43:56,655
Put me on a halfway decent
organization,

1048
00:43:56,758 --> 00:43:58,103
and I know we can win games.

1049
00:43:58,206 --> 00:43:59,551
And so,

1050
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:01,344
I finally have some players
who know how

1051
00:44:01,448 --> 00:44:03,241
to win a team challenge,
and it just felt great

1052
00:44:03,344 --> 00:44:05,965
to do what I knew I could do
and not feel like a crazy person

1053
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:08,000
continuously losing.

1054
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,103
We have fire.

1055
00:44:11,137 --> 00:44:14,413
Take a look at that bad boy.
Let's take a look at it.

1056
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:17,275
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

1057
00:44:19,965 --> 00:44:21,827
I don't have it.
My pocket's empty.

1058
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:24,068
Do I have a hole in my pocket?

1059
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:29,862
Ah! [laughs]

1060
00:44:29,965 --> 00:44:31,862
Bruce, never again.

1061
00:44:31,965 --> 00:44:33,000
-Ah.
-[laughter]

1062
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,586
Is this it?

1063
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:44,517
Some Lulu magic.

1064
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,620
It's going now!

1065
00:44:47,724 --> 00:44:49,103
[whoops]

1066
00:44:49,206 --> 00:44:51,275
Lulu has officially gotten fire.

1067
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:53,310
Right? Nice work.

1068
00:44:53,413 --> 00:44:55,172
Not having fire
until night nine

1069
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,862
is unprecedented.

1070
00:44:56,965 --> 00:44:59,862
I was excited to burn away
all of those bad juju vibes.

1071
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:02,206
It's almost like
sage was burnt at my camp,

1072
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,206
and now I can start
to look forward

1073
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,931
like a regular player
in this game.

1074
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:07,137
What a day.
This is my favorite day

1075
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:08,551
on Survivor,
I swear to you guys.

1076
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:11,965
And right now, I'm just so glad
I'm not Sean.

1077
00:45:19,896 --> 00:45:24,000
SEAN: I cannot believe
we lost the challenge.

1078
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:25,689
I mean,

1079
00:45:25,793 --> 00:45:28,517
coming out of Lulu into Reba,

1080
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,310
I was feeling so good

1081
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:34,310
because Reba had been
on this winning streak.

1082
00:45:34,413 --> 00:45:37,344
They've got this momentum going
that I can just

1083
00:45:37,448 --> 00:45:39,034
slip myself into.

1084
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:41,586
So I had every reason to believe

1085
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:45,965
that Reba would win today,
and then

1086
00:45:46,068 --> 00:45:48,758
we lost, and I'm just, like...

1087
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:51,000
Ugh. Like, deflated.

1088
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:55,896
DEE: Yeah.

1089
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:59,862
Honestly, though,
I'm the only person

1090
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,965
-to go to Tribal
-Just saying. Just saying.

1091
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:05,241
every single time.

1092
00:46:05,344 --> 00:46:07,275
-I didn't want to say anything.
-Like, why

1093
00:46:07,379 --> 00:46:09,000
-is this happening?
-DEE: I know everyone's
thinking it, so I just...

1094
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:10,448
SEAN:
These Reba members--

1095
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:13,137
they've been together
since day one.

1096
00:46:13,241 --> 00:46:15,068
And so, they've really been able

1097
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,379
to bond and build connections,
get to know one another,

1098
00:46:17,482 --> 00:46:19,517
and then, here I come.

1099
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,586
It's definitely daunting
to feel like

1100
00:46:21,689 --> 00:46:26,241
I'm stepping into a world that's
very, you know, just not my own.

1101
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:28,448
How are you feeling
about things over here?

1102
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:30,413
[Sifu sighs]

1103
00:46:30,517 --> 00:46:33,275
-I think Reba is pretty strong.
-Yeah.

1104
00:46:33,379 --> 00:46:35,034
I will say, the three of them
do seem really close.

1105
00:46:35,137 --> 00:46:37,172
SIFU:
Yeah.

1106
00:46:37,275 --> 00:46:39,310
-It's dangerous.
-I know.

1107
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:41,275
-I mean,
if I'm with you, I'm loyal.
-Okay.

1108
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:45,137
So, I'll be a number to
whoever wants to bring me along.

1109
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:47,379
-Like, I am loyal.
-Right.

1110
00:46:47,482 --> 00:46:50,689
I think Sean is awesome.
He's just got that good energy.

1111
00:46:50,793 --> 00:46:53,413
But it's Reba strong,
and that's his bad luck there.

1112
00:46:53,517 --> 00:46:54,551
I know you don't want
to leave this game.

1113
00:46:54,655 --> 00:46:55,758
-I know.
-Right?

1114
00:46:55,862 --> 00:46:57,931
-I know!
-[laughs]

1115
00:46:58,034 --> 00:46:59,275
SIFU:
I mean, it's horrible

1116
00:46:59,379 --> 00:47:01,413
because of what
he's already been through--

1117
00:47:01,517 --> 00:47:03,241
being badgered and beaten
every single day.

1118
00:47:03,344 --> 00:47:05,034
But I do have to think

1119
00:47:05,137 --> 00:47:07,068
that if Sean stays in this game,
that means

1120
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:11,517
everybody be pointing at Sifu,
and I really don't have an idol.

1121
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,137
That means Sifu would have
to fight his way out,

1122
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:14,620
and it would not look so great.

1123
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:15,931
So I don't even want
to go that route.

1124
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:17,793
I'd rather just
go the Sean route

1125
00:47:17,896 --> 00:47:20,862
and vote him out tonight.

1126
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:26,068
Yeah, it has to be us for sure.

1127
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:27,413
If we vote out Sean,

1128
00:47:27,517 --> 00:47:30,137
we actually have a chance
at a challenge tomorrow.

1129
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:32,137
At this point, it doesn't matter
to me as much as...

1130
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:34,034
-Yeah, it doesn't
matter, either.
-If Sifu plays an idol

1131
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:36,206
with the three of us,
one of us goes home.

1132
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,724
-So tonight's our best bet
at getting him out.
-Okay.

1133
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:40,896
J. MAYA:
I'm not thinking about

1134
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,413
"Reba strong" right now.

1135
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:43,827
Maybe in the merge,
I'll start thinking that,

1136
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:45,034
but what I'm thinking about is,

1137
00:47:45,137 --> 00:47:46,896
what is going to improve
my chances

1138
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,551
of being successful
come the merge?

1139
00:47:49,655 --> 00:47:52,827
I don't think Sifu coming
into the merge with us is going

1140
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:54,793
to be good for my game, and so,

1141
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:56,551
to be honest,
I'm taking this opportunity

1142
00:47:56,655 --> 00:47:59,586
to try to take out Sifu
before it's too late.

1143
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:01,931
He'll get antsy.
He won't believe us.

1144
00:48:02,034 --> 00:48:03,413
He'll play his idol,
he'll put one name down.

1145
00:48:03,517 --> 00:48:05,655
Yeah. He's too erratic.
Like, at least we can...

1146
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,655
We have an alliance, and
at least we can pull Sean in.

1147
00:48:08,758 --> 00:48:11,137
-This is how I see it.
-Mm-hmm.

1148
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:13,379
Sifu's first, then Sean.
Three, we merge.

1149
00:48:13,482 --> 00:48:15,931
But we've been saying
"Reba strong, Reba strong."

1150
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:17,310
But now that the swap is here,

1151
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:19,379
we got to pivot
and we got to adapt

1152
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:21,620
and we got to take people out
that we don't trust.

1153
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:23,758
And that's the game.
We have to play now.

1154
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:25,172
Y'all don't even want to try
to win tomorrow?

1155
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:27,034
J. MAYA:
It doesn't matter.

1156
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,310
JULIE:
The challenge today
was so physical.

1157
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:32,344
If we didn't have Sifu,
we'd still be in the water.

1158
00:48:32,448 --> 00:48:35,068
We would literally still
be in a cage in the water,

1159
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:36,655
just waving.

1160
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:40,310
But the girls, especially J.,

1161
00:48:40,413 --> 00:48:43,137
just want to go ahead
and get Sifu out now.

1162
00:48:43,241 --> 00:48:46,034
I hate that attitude.

1163
00:48:46,137 --> 00:48:49,344
The best way to not go home
is to not go to Tribal.

1164
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:52,137
The best way to not go to Tribal
is to win a challenge.

1165
00:48:52,241 --> 00:48:54,137
But I feel like
my hands are tied.

1166
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:56,137
I'm doing whatever... I want
to make sure we're strong.

1167
00:48:56,241 --> 00:48:58,137
-DEE: Yeah, yeah, same. Okay.
-J. MAYA: Hundred percent.

1168
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:00,206
JULIE:
Because, as of now, the best way

1169
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,482
I don't go home
is to keep the numbers.

1170
00:49:04,413 --> 00:49:06,965
DEE: So here's what
we're thinking tonight.
-SEAN: Yeah.

1171
00:49:09,137 --> 00:49:10,896
-Okay?
-Please. Please.

1172
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,448
-But you're gonna live
to see another day.
-Please.

1173
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,758
-SEAN: Done.
Done, done, done, done.
-JULIE: Yeah?

1174
00:49:18,862 --> 00:49:20,206
So, unfortunately, we're gonna

1175
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,862
-tell him you're out.
-Okay.
-DEE: Yeah.

1176
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:23,172
-Yeah.
-Because you're new.

1177
00:49:23,275 --> 00:49:24,758
It's the only decoy,
if that makes sense.

1178
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:27,068
It's the only thing, 'cause
if we keep saying, "Reba strong,

1179
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,448
-Reba strong, Reba strong,"
-Yeah.
-Right.

1180
00:49:28,551 --> 00:49:30,931
-he will believe.
-Right.

1181
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,965
-And we don't want him
to play anything.
-Right.

1182
00:49:33,068 --> 00:49:34,344
SEAN:
I hope they're being genuine

1183
00:49:34,448 --> 00:49:35,724
about wanting to get Sifu out.

1184
00:49:35,827 --> 00:49:37,413
They might not be.

1185
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,517
Maybe they're just trying
to make me feel comfortable

1186
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,689
so that I don't play
a Shot in the Dark.

1187
00:49:41,793 --> 00:49:45,413
And honestly, in this game,
where I'm at right now,

1188
00:49:45,517 --> 00:49:47,586
I don't have very many options

1189
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:50,068
but to trust
what I'm being told.

1190
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:51,241
JULIE:
Here's the other thing.

1191
00:49:51,344 --> 00:49:52,724
At Tribal-- I'm sorry--

1192
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:54,034
we're gonna be talking
Reba strong.

1193
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:55,482
-DEE: Yeah.
-SEAN: Yeah.

1194
00:49:56,655 --> 00:49:58,379
Yeah. Yeah.

1195
00:49:58,482 --> 00:50:00,586
SEAN:
Trustis a tricky thing
onSurvivor.

1196
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:03,827
I was blindsided last time
at Tribal Council

1197
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:07,206
and so, I want to come in, give
them the benefit of the doubt.

1198
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,172
Maybe that's absolutely insane
of me to be doing,

1199
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,827
given what I've been through,

1200
00:50:12,931 --> 00:50:15,896
but I feel like,
what other options do I have?

1201
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,862
♪ We're all a little paranoid♪

1202
00:50:19,965 --> 00:50:21,344
♪ It's okay♪

1203
00:50:22,344 --> 00:50:26,000
♪ We got to vote that way.♪

1204
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:37,068
-Yes.
-He didn't get to you guys?

1205
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:38,931
No.

1206
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:40,689
-Positive?
-Hundred percent.

1207
00:50:40,793 --> 00:50:45,034
SIFU:
So the plan tonight
is to vote Sean off, but

1208
00:50:45,137 --> 00:50:46,931
what's to say that
Sean hasn't gotten to them

1209
00:50:47,034 --> 00:50:49,172
and they're playing me,
they're playing Sifu,

1210
00:50:49,275 --> 00:50:50,586
and then I'm gone?

1211
00:50:50,689 --> 00:50:51,931
That is a possibility.

1212
00:50:52,034 --> 00:50:53,965
It's gonna take a lot of trust,

1213
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:57,310
but I believe that we can
remain Reba strong, and

1214
00:50:57,413 --> 00:51:00,068
if not, I am the fool.

1215
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,172
SEAN:
I did not expect

1216
00:51:04,275 --> 00:51:07,206
the SeanSurvivor story to be

1217
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:11,137
going to Tribal Council
every single time.

1218
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:14,931
And so, for me,
this particular Tribal Council

1219
00:51:15,034 --> 00:51:17,172
is about, will Sean

1220
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:20,517
be in the game
ofSurvivor any longer?

1221
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,896
That is literally what this
Tribal Council is about for me.

1222
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,310
♪ ♪

1223
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:41,206
-Oh, my God.
-Oh.

1224
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,103
-JULIE: Oh, my God.
-SIFU: Oh, my God.

1225
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:53,068
For everyone exceptSean,

1226
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:55,965
grab a torch, dip it in,
and get fire.

1227
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:11,896
PROBST:
This is part of the ritual

1228
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,103
at Tribal Council because

1229
00:52:14,206 --> 00:52:15,931
in this game,
fire represents your life,

1230
00:52:16,034 --> 00:52:18,862
and when your fire's gone,
so are you.

1231
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:22,965
All right, J.,
let's get to the switch.

1232
00:52:23,068 --> 00:52:25,206
For four of you,
nothing changed.

1233
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,862
-Yeah.
-The odds that four Rebas stay
on the same tribe--

1234
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:31,413
it's-it's mind-blowing
to think about.

1235
00:52:31,517 --> 00:52:33,965
We have a family dynamic
firmly established,

1236
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:37,206
and Sean has to find a way
to kind of slip in

1237
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,551
in under a day, it turns out,

1238
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,551
because
we lost the challenge today.

1239
00:52:40,655 --> 00:52:42,965
PROBST:
Well, and Sean, at the beginning
of the switch, I said,

1240
00:52:43,068 --> 00:52:44,931
"Getting to the end
on Survivorrequires

1241
00:52:45,034 --> 00:52:46,655
at least a little bit of luck."

1242
00:52:46,758 --> 00:52:48,275
SEAN:
Totally. I would say,

1243
00:52:48,379 --> 00:52:50,000
"good luck" in that,

1244
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:51,965
at the last Tribal Council
I was at,

1245
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,931
I was on the wrong side
of the vote.

1246
00:52:54,034 --> 00:52:57,724
I felt like I had new life
in this game with the switch.

1247
00:52:57,827 --> 00:53:00,586
And you can also argue that
it could have been a bad thing

1248
00:53:00,689 --> 00:53:03,551
because I don't know
these people.

1249
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:05,068
But I viewed it as a positive.

1250
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:07,517
PROBST:
Julie, the obvious vote is easy.

1251
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,103
If the four of you
just want to stay together,

1252
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:11,344
there's nothing Sean can do
to stop it.

1253
00:53:11,448 --> 00:53:13,344
Yes. I mean, respect.

1254
00:53:13,448 --> 00:53:16,724
His-his experience
on Survivor

1255
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:19,137
is nothing compared
to what we have.

1256
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:21,965
And we like you as a person,
we wanted

1257
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:24,724
to welcome him,
but yet, we've got four.

1258
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:28,482
So, it felt
a little play-pretend.

1259
00:53:28,586 --> 00:53:32,655
I don't think he could have
done anything more than he did.

1260
00:53:32,758 --> 00:53:34,551
So, Sean, what do you do?

1261
00:53:34,655 --> 00:53:36,034
I'm just myself.

1262
00:53:36,137 --> 00:53:38,379
That's all I cando,
is just be me.

1263
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:41,689
And I've expressed
that I want to connect

1264
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:43,517
and bond and get to know them.

1265
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,896
I feel like we have,

1266
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,689
even in the little bit
that we've been together.

1267
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:49,827
So, J., what is
the value system

1268
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:52,655
that the four Reba have
in terms of a tribe right now?

1269
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:55,344
You know, something
that I think about is,

1270
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:58,793
how to get a tribe down
to its best

1271
00:53:58,896 --> 00:54:00,137
challenge strength formation.

1272
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:01,965
I mean, look at Lulu.
What happened

1273
00:54:02,068 --> 00:54:03,862
when they decided
to vote Brandon?

1274
00:54:03,965 --> 00:54:05,448
They won the next challenge.

1275
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:07,965
Like, this is what can happen
when you talk about

1276
00:54:08,068 --> 00:54:10,068
what your strengths are
as a tribe in this moment.

1277
00:54:10,172 --> 00:54:12,482
Sean, did you pick up on that

1278
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:15,172
possible crack
that J.'s talking about?

1279
00:54:15,275 --> 00:54:16,793
Totally, because I know

1280
00:54:16,896 --> 00:54:19,724
Reba wants to continue
that winning momentum,

1281
00:54:19,827 --> 00:54:22,827
and I give my absolute all
in challenges.

1282
00:54:22,931 --> 00:54:27,103
Not only that.
I am extremely loyal.

1283
00:54:27,206 --> 00:54:29,931
I'm someone
that will align with you,

1284
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:32,172
that you want
to bring with you, because

1285
00:54:32,275 --> 00:54:34,000
I'm a number for you,
and you need to be

1286
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:36,689
on the right side of the numbers
when you go into the merge.

1287
00:54:36,793 --> 00:54:39,517
Dee, he's basically saying,

1288
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,965
"If there's anybody here
that you doubt, I'm loyal."

1289
00:54:43,068 --> 00:54:45,103
Yeah, I can definitely
feel for him.

1290
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:47,965
He wants to be on
the right side of the numbers.

1291
00:54:48,068 --> 00:54:50,206
But then, there's also a part
of me that's like,

1292
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,275
"We don't know Sean.
It's only been 24 hours

1293
00:54:53,379 --> 00:54:54,965
"and I've spent eight days
with these other people

1294
00:54:55,068 --> 00:54:56,965
that I've built
such great relationships with."

1295
00:54:57,068 --> 00:54:59,862
And that, for me, is where
I struggle, but it is something

1296
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:01,689
that we have to weigh.

1297
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:04,068
Sifu, Sean was
very straight-up.

1298
00:55:04,172 --> 00:55:07,413
He's saying, "If there is
anyone in this group

1299
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:10,448
"whose word you question
come a merge,

1300
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:11,896
I'm your guy."

1301
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,241
You know, I read energy
in my day-to-day life.

1302
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,620
I mean, Sifu
is a master instructor,

1303
00:55:16,724 --> 00:55:18,379
and I've been doing tai chi
since I was six

1304
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:21,551
and it's just integrated
in my-in my blood.

1305
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:23,931
And as soon as I met Sean,
I felt a really positive energy.

1306
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:26,068
-JULIE: Mm-hmm.
-You know what I'm saying?

1307
00:55:26,172 --> 00:55:29,655
It is very enticing, and I have
to take it for what it is,

1308
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:31,689
but it's not the burger I want.

1309
00:55:31,793 --> 00:55:33,344
You know what I'm saying?

1310
00:55:33,448 --> 00:55:34,896
Do you want a pizza?
What do you want?

1311
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,517
-[laughs]
-Jeff, come on!

1312
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,068
-I'll take a pizza.
-DEE: We all do.
We all want pizza.

1313
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,965
-I know. I'll be your pizza.
-SIFU: I might

1314
00:55:41,068 --> 00:55:42,517
cut somebody out if...
you start bringing pizza.

1315
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,000
-Right? Right?
-Can you be a veggie burger,
Sean?

1316
00:55:45,103 --> 00:55:46,413
There you go. I'll be...

1317
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:47,827
Girl, I'll be whatever you want.

1318
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,827
Um, I mean,

1319
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,172
Sifu's comment makes me
feel great that, you know,

1320
00:55:53,275 --> 00:55:55,482
that he sees my energy
as authentic and genuine,

1321
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:57,931
and that's exactly what it is.

1322
00:55:58,034 --> 00:56:01,275
That's what I bring
to the tribe.

1323
00:56:01,379 --> 00:56:02,862
PROBST:
So, Sean, if

1324
00:56:02,965 --> 00:56:05,172
what everybody is saying
is authentic,

1325
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:07,068
you're in trouble.

1326
00:56:07,172 --> 00:56:08,758
So what has Survivor
been for you?

1327
00:56:08,862 --> 00:56:10,965
What'd you get out of it,
if this is it?

1328
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:15,137
Oh, Jeff,
you opened up the gate.

1329
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,931
Okay, so,
in the game of Survivor,

1330
00:56:17,034 --> 00:56:20,206
I have experienced
a ton of failure,

1331
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,689
but it reminds me
of what I learned

1332
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:24,965
from my first grade teacher.

1333
00:56:25,068 --> 00:56:27,482
She said, "Failure is good.

1334
00:56:27,586 --> 00:56:29,137
"It helps us grow.

1335
00:56:29,241 --> 00:56:31,689
It teaches us
what we need to know."

1336
00:56:31,793 --> 00:56:34,551
And so, I've decided,
intentionally,

1337
00:56:34,655 --> 00:56:36,862
to embrace that failure.

1338
00:56:36,965 --> 00:56:39,689
And, Jeff,
if I'm being completely honest

1339
00:56:39,793 --> 00:56:41,586
with you, and with my tribe,

1340
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:44,137
