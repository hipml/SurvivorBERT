<i>threw it in,
locked it back up nice,</i>

175
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,863
looking like
nothing's been touched in there.

176
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:23,034
Who should we have
try to find it?

177
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,655
I don't know yet. [laughs]

178
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:29,000
<i>I took the key, I wrapped it
in a nice green bow.</i>

179
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:31,068
I think it looks pretty good.

180
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:32,689
This is better
than the fake idol.

181
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:35,758
<i>I've now re-hid the key
that I found.</i>

182
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,482
<i>Hopefully, the opposition
takes the bait.</i>

183
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:40,379
<i>That way,
any rumors, any kind of</i>

184
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,379
shadow of a doubt
that maybe Danny has it...

185
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:43,793
<i>That's the end of it.</i>

186
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,616
All right. Who do you guys
got your bets on?

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
YAM YAM:
When I wake up from this

188
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:57,034
two-minute nap,
I'm gonna go get wood.

189
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:59,137
CAROLYN:
I'm getting so tired, too.

190
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,310
You've been snoring
like a monster at night, too.

191
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:03,586
- YAM YAM: Me?
- Oh, my... Yes.

192
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:07,344
[snoring]

193
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:09,137
<i>CAROLYNN:
It sucks.</i>

194
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:12,655
- [laughing]
- It's horrible, and I just
get so pissed at you.

195
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,448
And then, you'll get up and...
from the fire, and be like...

196
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:19,758
If I see that you're smiling, I
get really mad 'cause I'm, like,

197
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:23,551
you don't
have to deal with this.

198
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:25,931
<i>YAM YAM:
Nobody have ever said anything
about my snoring.</i>

199
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:28,482
I know I snore.
My husband tells me.

200
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:30,068
Like, he's super annoyed
I snore.

201
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:33,517
<i>But for some reason,
I thought I wasn't snoring here.</i>

202
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,275
People get voted off
because of snoring.

203
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,482
I don't want to get voted off
because of snoring.

204
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:40,068
I would never vote you out
because you snore.

205
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:41,827
[laughing]

206
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:43,771
<i>SARAH:
I love it when
the tribe's getting along.</i>

207
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:45,620
<i>I think it does
feel good to laugh,</i>

208
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,793
<i>which is, honestly,
so healthy out here.</i>

209
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:50,862
Yes! <i>Baywatch,</i> baby!

210
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:54,275
Yes! You look stunning.

211
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:58,172
<i>But I am laughing slightly less
hard than everyone else because</i>

212
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:00,337
I have a lot more weighing on me
than the three of them.

213
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:03,413
CARSON:
I just want us to go far and not

214
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:05,310
have to worry about
going to Tribal anymore.

215
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:09,206
I sure hope that, too,
but I feel like

216
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,310
- odds are, in the next three...
- Yes, three.

217
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:12,793
We're going at least once.

218
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:16,310
<i>Our team is so weak.</i>

219
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:17,517
<i>In order to win,</i>

220
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,034
we need it to be
some challenge that

221
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:22,896
perfectly caters
to sweet little Tika's skills.

222
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,344
<i>And I am clearly at the bottom
of a very small group,</i>

223
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:29,551
<i>so unless a miracle happens,</i>

224
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:31,241
I'm the one that's gonna go.

225
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:48,275
Ay-ay-ay.

226
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,793
<i>We were all scrambling,
looking for some sort of key</i>

227
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:54,275
<i>to open the lock for the cage.</i>

228
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,758
I don't know yet.
I'm going crazy with ideas.

229
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,448
I sat in front of the cage.

230
00:09:58,551 --> 00:09:59,793
I'm running out of ideas.

231
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:01,164
And are you just
sitting here pondering?

232
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,509
You're just sitting here,
staring at it?

233
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,034
It's, like,
what-what are we missing?

234
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,682
<i>I haven't found it,
so I don't have it yet, but</i>

235
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:07,716
hopefully it comes to me
before someone else finds it.

236
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,689
You should be
reaching your hands

237
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:11,241
into each one
of these guys, bro.

238
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,164
Do snakes, like, live in there?
You know what I mean?

239
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:15,482
- Yeah.
- Like... Or-or rats.

240
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:18,068
<i>DANNY:
Group search parties?
Group search parties?</i>

241
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:20,379
<i>Dude, this is perfect,
but it turns out</i>

242
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:21,896
<i>they're not good lookers.</i>

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,406
<i>Like, you don't just look
at a tree and go,</i>

244
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:26,000
"Check, that tree's done."
No, dude, get in there.

245
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:29,413
No. No. [groans]

246
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:31,448
<i>DANNY:
The key, I put</i>

247
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,034
<i>in the most obvious spot.</i>

248
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:35,275
<i>This is baffling to me.
Come on.</i>

249
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:36,751
Move some leaves around.
This is <i>Survivor.</i>

250
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:38,172
You've watched the show.

251
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:46,827
DANNY:
No. You?

252
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:48,896
No.

253
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:53,931
<i>MATT: This is the key that</i>

254
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:55,551
everyone has been looking for.

255
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,751
This is the key that has been
taunting us the entire time.

256
00:10:57,793 --> 00:10:59,034
<i>Danny goes off.</i>

257
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,103
<i>I'm feeling like
I'm in the clear.</i>

258
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:03,103
Come to Papa.

259
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,068
"Congratulations. You have found
a hidden immunity idol."

260
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:11,724
Yes. Let's go.

261
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:13,068
<i>My heart starts pounding.</i>

262
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,068
<i>The hidden immunity idol
right here.</i>

263
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:18,448
Mwah. This is power.

264
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:20,655
<i>I need this.</i>

265
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:23,413
<i>Everything in this game
has gone wrong for me so far.</i>

266
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:29,482
You sneaky little snake, you.
You sneaky little snake.

267
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:32,827
Phew. All right, now it's time
to tell everybody I...

268
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:35,241
I saw Matt putting something
in his pocket.

269
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:38,068
Yeah, yeah.

270
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:40,310
What'd you put in your pocket?

271
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,137
I... I swear
I didn't find anything.

272
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,137
I swear I didn't find anything.

273
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:50,034
- Okay. I don't believe you.
- [Matt laughs]

274
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:52,068
I-I, like, swear it.

275
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:54,034
Okay, so...

276
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,724
Okay.

277
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:58,068
<i>MATT:
I'm, like, being outed</i>

278
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:00,965
<i>in front of Josh by Danny.</i>

279
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:04,103
Oh, no. Heart sink.

280
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:08,379
Like, this clean idol that was,
like, my hope in this game,

281
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:12,344
<i>and it's just been
bathed in mud.</i>

282
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:15,275
The jig is up, at this point.
My hand is forced.

283
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,379
[Matt laughs]

284
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,896
Okay. All right.

285
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,406
<i>JOSH:
Matt showed me that
he had an immunity idol.</i>

286
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:26,896
Let's go. Let's go.

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,586
<i>JOSH: So that's great for me</i>

288
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:30,344
and his relationship.

289
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,344
Um, so because of that,
things have changed.

290
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:33,716
Now that
he has an immunity idol,

291
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:35,517
<i>Matt and Frannie</i>

292
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,344
<i>are no longer easy targets, so,</i>

293
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:39,896
it's a good and bad thing.

294
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,896
Yes. We have an immunity idol.

295
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,862
Yes. Okay. That's good.

296
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:46,413
- We've got it. We're in good...
- Really good. Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,413
<i>FRANNIE:
The good news is
that Matt has an idol.</i>

298
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,758
<i>The bad news is that</i>

299
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:51,102
the worst people know about it.

300
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:52,413
Danny knows about it.

301
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,241
<i>And Josh knows about it.</i>

302
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,095
<i>I would have loved
if this idol was something</i>

303
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:57,551
<i>just between Matt and I, but</i>

304
00:12:57,655 --> 00:12:59,344
that throws a wrench
into things.

305
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:01,793
I'm-I'm telling you
because I-I got you.

306
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,965
I feel really confident,
me and you.

307
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,137
<i>The epicenter
of this mission was</i>

308
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:11,068
get people off my tail.

309
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,310
<i>Now everybody has
a false perception</i>

310
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:14,896
<i>that Matt found the idol,</i>

311
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,931
which works out
splendidly for me.

312
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:18,613
<i>I don't have to worry
about people being on my case</i>

313
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:19,862
<i>about having the idol.</i>

314
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,689
[chortling]

315
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:24,931
<i>So, as of now, everything's
looking really good.</i>

316
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:30,206
<i>JAIME: I found a big one.</i>

317
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,551
- I'm gonna eat it raw.
- MATTHEW: You are?

318
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:34,517
Is that the only way
to eat it, right?

319
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,103
That's not. I mean, I... Yeah.

320
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,130
Is everybody gonna eat a worm
or am I the only one?

321
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:42,862
If you eat that raw worm,
I'll eat a raw worm.

322
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:44,820
- What's the worst
that can happen?
- MATTHEW: Not much.

323
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:47,137
That's 70% protein right there.

324
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:51,000
- It is.
- [Lauren gasping]

325
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:53,827
- Oh.
- LAUREN: Oh, my God!

326
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,620
- Yes!
- [laughing]

327
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:58,862
<i>LAUREN:
Me and Jaime
are not exactly the same.</i>

328
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:02,379
She's definitely
on a high at all times,

329
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:04,827
<i>which kind of
boosts the morale for us.</i>

330
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,475
This thing is still
moving in its water,

331
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,620
- flipping and flopping.
- Ugh.
- JAIME: It will die

332
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,206
as soon
as it hits your stomach acid.

333
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,710
Well, I don't have any acid.
I don't have anything inside me.

334
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:14,793
<i>You come out here to the islands</i>

335
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,068
of Fiji, like,
you got to try new things.

336
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,532
<i>The biggest thing for me was
to show my kids and my students</i>

337
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,931
<i>that you can
take on any challenge,</i>

338
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:25,379
and you can overcome it.

339
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:28,655
- Three, two, one.
- Two, one.

340
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,344

00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:29,923
<i>it was supposed to be Matt
or Frannie to go home.</i>

675
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:32,344
<i>But it's not in my best interest</i>

676
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,517
to go against the tribe at this
point in time 'cause it's gonna

677
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,137
<i>put a bigger target on my back.</i>

678
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,758
<i>So, I don't want to rock
the boat. Yeah, Claire can go.</i>

679
00:30:39,862 --> 00:30:42,206
But if we can get everyone else
on board with this,

680
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,923
then you can save your idol
so you don't have to use it.

681
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:45,344
Yeah.

682
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:48,862
We do need
to put our heads together,

683
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:51,275
whether we do
the slightly easier thing,

684
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:53,448
which is just taking Matt out.

685
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,379
If he truly doesn't have a vote,
he cannot Shot in the Dark.

686
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,068
You see what I'm saying?
So I think...

687
00:30:58,172 --> 00:30:59,440
<i>FRANNIE:
Claire thinks
that Matt is the person</i>

688
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,896
<i>that we're voting off,</i>

689
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,275
<i>but Danny and Josh
are firmly against Claire.</i>

690
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:08,689
<i>And Claire is somebody that I
want to work with strategically.</i>

691
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:11,310
I don't want to just vote out
Claire, and then be,

692
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,896
you know, up a creek without
a paddle after she's gone.

693
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,965
<i>So I want to keep
her and Matt in this game.</i>

694
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:18,103
<i>I think that</i>

695
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:19,793
Matt is predictable

696
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:22,655
and very malleable
to whatever you or I see.

697
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:24,758
Yeah.

698
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:27,689
I actually do feel like,
for this first vote,

699
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:29,793
Josh is better because Josh,

700
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:33,034
I think, is just
so unpredictable.

701
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:34,992
<i>I don't feel like I have
an open relationship with Josh.</i>

702
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:38,862
<i>I think that
Josh is pretty cagey.</i>

703
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:41,517
In my perfect world,
I would love Claire, Heidi and I

704
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,241
to vote together
to get Josh out of this game.

705
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:49,000
Danny and Josh both told me
that it was you.

706
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:52,137
<i>CLAIRE: I am fuming,
baffled, insulted</i>

707
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,310
<i>that Josh and Danny think</i>

708
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,758
that they are smart enough
to pull one over on me.

709
00:31:57,862 --> 00:31:59,172
Like, are you kidding me?

710
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:01,896
<i>Danny, I actually
am now thinking,</i>

711
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,586
<i>he doesn't have brains
in his head,</i>

712
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,586
<i>so he's not a threat to me.</i>

713
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:07,578
<i>But I do not trust Josh
as far as I can throw him.</i>

714
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,700
<i>Now that I know he's gunning
for me, I want him gone.</i>

715
00:32:12,655 --> 00:32:13,965
- We need...
- We need Heidi.

716
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,862
- We need Heidi...
- with you two...

717
00:32:15,965 --> 00:32:17,275
To vote Josh.

718
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:19,099
- CLAIRE: We need... Heidi.
- We need Heidi.

719
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:22,448
DANNY: Yeah.

720
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:24,130
- All he takes is three,
by the way.
- DANNY: Yeah.

721
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:26,931
<i>MATT:
Heidi is the linchpin in it.</i>

722
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:28,337
- That's our first step.
- MATT: Yeah.

723
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,819
'Cause if Heidi will flip,
it's easy.

724
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:34,137
My life in this game is
going to be 100% in your hands.

725
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:36,522
- Frannie is locked in.
Frannie will vote for Josh.
- Okay.

726
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:40,068
And they're gonna pull you in
and try to get me.

727
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:42,620
- I...
- I have to think
about this so much. Like...

728
00:32:42,724 --> 00:32:44,965
- Think about what?
- Uh, like...

729
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:47,000
The decision
you're making is me or...

730
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:50,068
- Yeah, and I will tell you.
- So, you're thinking...

731
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:52,655
If-if... if I cannot convince,
I don't think it's on me only.

732
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:55,551
<i>CLAIRE:
I am so nervous about my life
in the game right now.</i>

733
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:57,172
<i>I am hanging on by a thread.</i>

734
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,965
It's going to be
a game-time decision

735
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:00,958
whether or not I play
my Shot in the Dark tonight.

736
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,896
It's really coming down
to how good I feel about Heidi.

737
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:12,820
<i>HEIDI: It's very hard
because it seems like</i>

738
00:33:12,862 --> 00:33:16,241
<i>everyone wants Josh out,
except Danny, but I feel</i>

739
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:19,275
like Danny is probably
my number one.

740
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:23,758
This game is about necessity.
We don't need Claire now.

741
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:27,793
I understand, logically,
the strength argument, but...

742
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:31,758
Yeah.

743
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:34,620
But I'm still undecided.

744
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:37,724
- Yeah.
- DANNY: So...

745
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,482
FRANNIE:
I won't go against you, either.

746
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:41,620
<i>HEIDI:
I'm trying to decide
what's best for my game.</i>

747
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:44,655
<i>My relationship
with Josh is not that great.</i>

748
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:47,379
He hasn't quite talked
that much strategy with me.

749
00:33:47,482 --> 00:33:49,413
- I love you. Can I have a hug?
- Aw.

750
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:53,310
<i>HEIDI:
Claire and I are
a little bit more aligned, but</i>

751
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:55,620
with Claire, we may not be able
to win more challenges,

752
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:57,655
so, yeah, I'm conflicted.

753
00:33:57,758 --> 00:33:59,475
<i>No matter what,
it's gonna be heartbreaking.</i>

754
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:01,620
<i>But in here, it's cutthroat,</i>

755
00:34:01,724 --> 00:34:03,524
<i>and I'm in it to win it,
and I'm in it for me,</i>

756
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,620
I'm in it for my family,
not for them.

757
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:21,172
♪ ♪

758
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:33,137
Behind each of you is a torch.
Go ahead and grab a torch,

759
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:35,586
dip it in the fire
and get flame.

760
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:45,586
This is part of the ritual
of Tribal Council

761
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:48,689
because in this game,
fire represents your life.

762
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:51,379
When the fire is gone,
so are you.

763
00:34:51,482 --> 00:34:53,689
Frannie, you're smiling.
Is it because

764
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:55,620
the ritual of even saying that

765
00:34:55,724 --> 00:34:57,344
heightens the feeling
of being here?

766
00:34:57,448 --> 00:35:01,310
Oh, yeah. It all felt imaginary
as we were walking in.

767
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:04,137
And then you hear those words,
your magic words,

768
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:07,862
and we know that we're here,
and we're playing.

769
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:11,551
Josh, for all of the
Tribal Council "ooh" and "ah,"

770
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:14,896
it's that gargoyle.
That's Tribal.

771
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:18,931
"I'm coming." For somebody.
Did you feel that back at camp?

772
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,689
JOSH:
You know, Jeff,
when we got back today,

773
00:35:21,793 --> 00:35:24,137
the tension was on. You could
tell Tribal was looming.

774
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:26,379
You know, people were starting
to scramble and go off

775
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:28,448
on their own
and start talking strategy.

776
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:30,551
So, this was
a completely different feeling

777
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:31,931
that we weren't used to.

778
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:34,206
Claire, what's the smile for?

779
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,551
Today was not the first day
they were playing.

780
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:38,482
I just don't want to lie and say

781
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:40,620
that this is the first time
we've ever decided

782
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,275
to look towards each other
and think about it, right?

783
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:45,275
It's become clear to me
that people have already

784
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:47,586
been thinking about it
for a while.

785
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,172
PROBST:
Frannie, do you understand

786
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:51,448
what Claire's talking about
when she says, "Come on,

787
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:52,911
people have been
playing the game"?

788
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,517
Yeah. We can all
pretend, you know,

789
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,034
for the past however many days

790
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,551
that we've been
a big, happy family but

791
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:01,206
none of us forgets
for a second why we're here

792
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,482
and what we're here to do.
And so,

793
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:05,095
people have been talking,
but it's like

794
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:06,551
a sick merry-go-round, you know?

795
00:36:06,655 --> 00:36:08,164
Every name is gonna be said
at some point.

796
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:11,000
You just don't want it
to land on yours.

797
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:12,931
PROBST:
And Heidi, did it
really feel like

798
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:15,413
it could be anybody
or did it feel like,

799
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:17,477
"No, there are certain names
that keep coming up"?

800
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,310
HEIDI:
I think it could be anybody.

801
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:21,965
And I think we would be foolish
not to look through

802
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:24,896
all the options to see what's
best for each of our games.

803
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,724
PROBST:
So that's
the big question, Matt.

804
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:30,068
What's best for everybody's game
is to never come back to Tribal.

805
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:33,965
But what's best for somebody's
individual game could be, "Well,

806
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:35,655
"we do have
to get rid of somebody,

807
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:37,827
and this is
who <i>I</i> want to get rid of."

808
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:40,103
I know for myself,
I have played through

809
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:42,241
so many scenarios.

810
00:36:42,344 --> 00:36:46,137
Like, "Can I trust this person,
can I trust that person?"

811
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:48,827
That is the balance
that we are all walking.

812
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:52,551
Claire, you've sat out
of every immunity challenge,

813
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:56,551
and the tribe always concurs
that this is a tribe decision.

814
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:58,482
But is there any concern

815
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:00,206
that that tribe decision

816
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,793
may actually
just be fingers going,

817
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:03,785
"You don't even contribute
at the challenges anyway"?

818
00:37:03,827 --> 00:37:06,206
There's a ton of concern
for me because,

819
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,820
to be completely honest,
you know, I love this game.

820
00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:11,103
I came to play everything,
but every single time,

821
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:15,551
swallowed my pride, put down
that urge to try and test myself

822
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:17,448
and fight and play with you all

823
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:19,793
because I was putting the team
before myself.

824
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:22,379
And so I sat out.
But in the moment,

825
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:24,034
I trusted you all.

826
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:27,689
So it stinks to hear that people
are valuing tribe strength when

827
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:30,275
they didn't even give me a
chance to show what I'm made of.

828
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:31,931
PROBST:
Danny, you were nodding.

829
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:33,889
DANNY:
Yeah, I definitely think
our concerns are accurate.

830
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:37,137
And, you know, conversations
were had about that.

831
00:37:37,241 --> 00:37:38,751
CLAIRE:
But I think it's just
easy to say, you know,

832
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:41,068
"Those people who step up,
put their neck on the line

833
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:42,689
are doing it."

834
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,992
But is brute force strength
really what tribe strength is?

835
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:46,793
What is tribe strength
other than

836
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:48,620
trusting each other
and working together

837
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,206
and not doing things
that could harm

838
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,000
Soka making it further
in the game?

839
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:54,716
PROBST:
Heidi, it's a pretty
compelling argument.

840
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:57,448
I agree 100% with what she said.

841
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:59,103
Yeah, absolutely.
What is strength?

842
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:02,724
Is it really just being
the strongest, the best swimmer?

843
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,551
- Maybe, maybe not.
- FRANNIE: To Claire,

844
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:06,724
I just want to say I'm confident

845
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:08,095
that you would have
crushed any challenge

846
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:09,344
you would have been in.

847
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:11,241
So this is
a lot more complicated than

848
00:38:11,344 --> 00:38:12,793
"Claire's on the chopping block

849
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:15,000
because Claire
sat out of challenges."

850
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:17,689
You can't think quite
so myopically in this game

851
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:19,724
about this one vote.

852
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:22,241
We all kind of need
to zoom out of it and realize

853
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:24,413
that this is a longer game
than just tonight.

854
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:26,931
PROBST:
So, Matt, what's the criteria

855
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:30,034
at your first vote
when there's only six people?

856
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:32,000
<i>Survivor</i> is a game of trust,
and so,

857
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:34,758
not so much, like,
challenges or whatever.

858
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:36,586
It's all about trust.

859
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,310
Claire, you still
look concerned.

860
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:41,931
CLAIRE:
Yeah, I don't feel good at all.

861
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:44,482
I mean, uh, I'm just
gonna be brazen.

862
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:47,000
Like, have you...
have you thought at all more?

863
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,448
Are you still at the place
you were before?

864
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,931
- I think so.
- Okay.

865
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:56,758
That sounded coded, but it...
you know what it means?

866
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:59,000
I think I know what it means.
Heidi's, like,

867
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:02,517
- figuring it out, but...
- PROBST: Heidi, this is

868
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,689
- a tough time
to be figuring it out.
- Absolutely.

869
00:39:04,793 --> 00:39:06,689
And in all honesty,
this is our dream.

870
00:39:06,793 --> 00:39:08,931
All of us dreamt to be here.

871
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:11,034
Unfortunately, it's gonna be

872
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:12,655
the last day for someone,

873
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:16,275
so one of the dreams
is coming to an end.

874
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:24,000
All right, it is time to vote.
