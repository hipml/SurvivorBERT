1
00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:03,066
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:05,906
In the Tavua tribe,

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:08,183
Troyzan was in the minority.

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,344
I'm sure Troyzan feels on the fringe,

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,520
because he is.

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,113
In the Mana tribe,

7
00:00:13,238 --> 00:00:15,132
Tai found a clue leading to an idol.

8
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:16,258
Oh my God!

9
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,952
"You will have to wet a wooden board."

10
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:21,864
And Debbie lost her mind.

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,435
I was totally loyal to you.

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,951
And you broke my heart!

13
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:26,093
It's frustrating,

14
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:27,369
and I'm pissed!

15
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:29,062
In the Nuku tribe,

16
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:32,535
Aubry and JT attempted to rally the troops.

17
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,134
We'd be better off without Michaela.

18
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:37,412
But Sandra was leading the charge.

19
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,814
with you, me

20
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,007
and Michaela,

21
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:41,341
we can take out JT.

22
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,020
At the council,

23
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,581
Sandra got what she wanted. Again.

24
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:50,058
JT, the tribe has spoken.

25
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,190
And Aubry was kept in the dark.

26
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:56,418
There are 15 left.

27
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,499
Who will be eliminated tonight?

28
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:09,936
Nice shot, friends.

29
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,140
You are there to play. I am impressed.

30
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:14,770
Really.

31
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:17,886
I thought at the council, Michaela was going to leave.

32
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,855
And they eliminated JT.

33
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:22,891
I'm always at the bottom of the ladder.

34
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:27,129
I think I put a lot of effort into building relationships

35
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,269
with these people.

36
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:29,956
But it blows my mind.

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,030
Why did you keep me instead of him?

38
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:34,728
It was because of betrayal.

39
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,405
When Malcolm left,

40
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,940
I took it very badly.

41
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,775
We lost someone because of him.

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,177
He had to answer for his actions.

43
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,478
Clearly,

44
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,303
Sandra is in charge.

45
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,750
And it's as if she sawed off my legs, like a slow death.

46
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,814
It was quite a blow.

47
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,221
Bravo.

48
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:55,457
Without a doubt, Sandra is the best here.

49
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,513
She is the queen of this game.

50
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,919
I have a thing or two to learn from her.

51
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,920
I found a clue just now.

52
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,409
"Look for a board."

53
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:18,207
I racked my brains, and I thought, the well.

54
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,730
It must be over there.

55
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:21,975
So I have to act.

56
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,977
I have to go get this idol.

57
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,252
But I have to hurry, before they wake up.

58
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:35,792
The clue says to wet the board.

59
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,855
Once you find the board with the tribe's logo,

60
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,332
you have to dig underneath, the idol is there.

61
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:05,423
At the last board that I wet, that's it!

62
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:07,054
White and shiny,

63
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:08,455
the anchor symbol.

64
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,566
This is so cool!

65
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,098
Oui.

66
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,529
I'm the king of the lucky guys.

67
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:16,930
I found the idol, the second in three days!

68
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,041
The last time I played one,

69
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,577
I changed the course of the game.

70
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,154
Malcolm is gone. Power has changed sides.

71
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:28,417
This one, I don't think I'll use it anytime soon.

72
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,415
We'll see. For now, I'm playing.

73
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,688
I am the game changer.

74
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:35,057
I couldn't be happier.

75
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:39,761
Survivor Game Changers Season 34 Episode 05 Stuff the Ballot Box

76
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,354
Over here, everyone!

77
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:52,474
Mana et Stavua,

78
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,226
discover the new Nuku tribe.

79
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:56,737
JT was eliminated

80
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,380
at the last tip.

81
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,631
Shit.

82
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,879
Glad to see that both tribes brought their idols.

83
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:07,314
I take them back.

84
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:11,685
Merci.

85
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,255
What the hell will happen? I do not know.

86
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:17,057
What's on the table, Jeff?

87
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:19,656
Glad to have them back.

88
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,828
even if they will not be used today.

89
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:27,075
Throw away your bandanas!

90
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,320
We are changing things again.

91
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:33,874
Goodbye, Mana!

92
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,756
Good. On s'y met?

93
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,024
Yeah! Go for it!

94
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,083
Yes sir!

95
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,651
Without opening it, take one.

96
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,589
What a crazy game!

97
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:51,602
My God, Jeff! Which is the correct one?

98
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:55,427
I don't know, but I'll have the one no one wanted!

99
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,364
I'm afraid.

100
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,881
Reveal your bandanas!

101
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:08,584
If you have orange, take a seat on the Mana mat.

102
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:09,848
Orange.

103
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:13,355
If you have blue, take a seat on the Nuku mat.

104
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,187
Debbie...

105
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:17,313
Debbie!

106
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:19,196
Debbie... ...has nothing.

107
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:20,696
...has no bandana,

108
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,965
because Debbie is without a tribe.

109
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:25,901
Debbie, take a seat in the middle.

110
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:29,938
I am Zeke. Nice to meet you.

111
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:31,873
Delighted. Enchanted, my friend.

112
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,645
Cirie! Nice to meet you!

113
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:35,726
Oh my God!

114
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,206
Three homos together!

115
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,719
We are very happy, on both sides.

116
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,235
The New Mana Tribe,

117
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,452
Troyzan,

118
00:05:46,577 --> 00:05:47,589
Michaela,

119
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,840
Sierra,

120
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:49,966
Hali,

121
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:51,092
Aubry,

122
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,977
Cirie and Culpepper.

123
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,788
The new Nuku tribe,

124
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,064
Sandra,

125
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,190
Sarah,

126
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,229
Warns,

127
00:05:58,354 --> 00:05:59,259
Andrea,

128
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,385
that,

129
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,503
Zeke

130
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,629
et Ozzy.

131
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,998
The game changes so fast!

132
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:06,466
Sandra and Varner

133
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,068
are now in the minority.

134
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,638
Sandra. You're in the back, hands in your pockets,

135
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:13,415
not very talkative.

136
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,841
What do you think?

137
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,451
I'm optimistic.

138
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,561
I hope they will get to know me

139
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:23,629
before deciding that if it goes one way, I'll finish the other.

140
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,829
Stuck in the middle, homeless, Debbie.

141
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,058
Let me explain to you.

142
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:32,893
You won't go anywhere

143
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,136
except...

144
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,495
on Exile Island.

145
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:40,776
You will depart from here for the island of Exile,

146
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,602
where you will live alone.

147
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,146
You will come back in the game

148
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,114
at the next council,

149
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,275
where you will join the tribe

150
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,177
which will lose one of its members.

151
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:51,980
The good news is obvious.

152
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:54,423
You cannot be eliminated on the next board.

153
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,226
The bad news is just as obvious.

154
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,819
You cannot bind.

155
00:06:58,944 --> 00:06:59,953
With nobody.

156
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:01,388
It sucks.

157
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,132
What are you thinking right now?

158
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,435
What are you focusing your thoughts on?

159
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:09,271
When I was young, I often left alone,

160
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:10,522
with a pony.

161
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:13,408
I'm sure there aren't any on Exile Island.

162
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,088
But I'll get through this, alone.

163
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:18,565
And I will be optimistic about my future tribe.

164
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,074
Good, Debbie. Take your things,

165
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,651
head out to the ocean.

166
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,012
The boat is waiting to take you to the island.

167
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,560
Good. Mana, Nuku.

168
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,185
Take your things, return to camp.

169
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:36,598
The game has changed again.

170
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:39,310
I went from bottom to top in a split second.

171
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:40,903
I don't know how it happened,

172
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,672
but I'll go head first. I am not afraid.

173
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,647
But first I have to overcome the trauma.

174
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:02,229
Welcome back! Yes, welcome back!

175
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,424
It's changed a bit, but it still looks great.

176
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:07,451
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

177
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:10,323
Here we go, buddy!

178
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,465
"Throw away your bandanas!",

179
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,577
"Well, luck should turn for me."

180
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:19,104
Being 5 against 1 in Tavua,

181
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:21,841
it was rough, even though I have an idol.

182
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,908
I've been on my toes these past few days.

183
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:25,419
So I said to myself

184
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:27,725
that whatever happens now would be fine.

185
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,623
We live on coconuts,

186
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:32,485
but it keeps it going. That's all, just coconuts?

187
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,611
That's all.

188
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:36,456
Jeff has some surprises in store for us this season. Here's another one.

189
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:39,050
I fail in a tribe where I hardly know anyone.

190
00:08:39,175 --> 00:08:41,625
I have Sierra, I've had her all along.

191
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:44,303
But when we were in the same tribe as Hali,

192
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:45,824
we weren't very close.

193
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,001
And I never had a connection with Cirie.

194
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:49,536
I don't know Aubry

195
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:50,761
is Michaela.

196
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:54,399
But there's Troyzan, who played with my wife Monica.

197
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:56,634
It should help bond.

198
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,159
And he's a man.

199
00:08:58,591 --> 00:08:59,650
Like me.

200
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:01,481
We're the only two in the tribe.

201
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:06,344
Troy!

202
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,421
How do you see things?

203
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:11,644
I do not know. It's as if I was on my own.

204
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:12,917
But you are not.

205
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:15,552
I've been with Sierra since the beginning.

206
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:16,964
So you are...

207
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,815
Yeah. Friends.

208
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,552
You must stay with us.

209
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:23,195
Brad looks blunt to me from the necklace.

210
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:25,359
I also feel we are connected,

211
00:09:25,484 --> 00:09:29,376
because we're the only two guys with five wives.

212
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:32,579
It brings me back to my season, One World.

213
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,873
The last thing I want is to get me

214
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:36,633
again bamboozled by women.

215
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:38,043
I tell you, look at me.

216
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:40,220
Don't be nervous with me.

217
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,495
Neither do I.

218
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,621
Neither do I.

219
00:09:42,746 --> 00:09:43,747
Tope is!

220
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:45,258
I see Troy

221
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:47,627
as an ally for the future.

222
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:50,566
I feel good with Sierra and Troy.

223
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,165
But that's only three.

224
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,267
And I need a majority of four.

225
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:56,292
So I still have work.

226
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,666
Do you have any coffee left?

227
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,378
Yes, but just coffee.

228
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:07,939
How many chickens are there left? Just three.

229
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:10,650
Where do you come from? I grew up in Oklahoma City.

230
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,785
I live in Brooklyn now.

231
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:14,654
Oh yeah? I lived in Manhattan.

232
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:15,980
Ah, super.

233
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:17,916
Sandra and I are on the fringes.

234
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,099
We find ourselves in the minority

235
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:24,264
because Andrea, Zeke, Sarah and Ozzy were together in Tavua.

236
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,267
And Tai was in old Nuku with them.

237
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:29,327
It is obvious that they are together.

238
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:32,959
It's weird to suddenly be at the bottom of the ladder, isn't it?

239
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,063
I'm not even afraid.

240
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:38,762
Varner and I are in trouble.

241
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:42,266
But when I find myself in the minority,

242
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,450
I stay calm and focused

243
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,191
because when I'm in the bath,

244
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:48,788
give me 1 or 2 days

245
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:50,815
and I will be in charge here too.

246
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,993
The queen remains queen.

247
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:57,255
So I think, uh...

248
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:59,457
To be clear, I want Sandra gone.

249
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:00,583
Me too.

250
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,834
She terrifies me.

251
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:05,440
We need to get Sandra out before the merge.

252
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,374
Otherwise, she will beat us.

253
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:10,154
"We can take it out whenever we want."

254
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,432
But what happened to everyone who said that?

255
00:11:12,557 --> 00:11:15,315
They lost a million dollars to Sandra Diaz-Twine.

256
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,901
How do you want to play it with Sandra and Varner?

257
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:21,286
They have to be made to believe that they are safe.

258
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,808
Clearly, they have to be taken by surprise.

259
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,660
In case they have an idol.

260
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:28,833
You have to find a story to tell them.

261
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,097
It is to achieve the impossible.

262
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:33,658
No one ever took Sandra out. So it will be very hard.

263
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:35,460
We have to tell them a story.

264
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,436
Let them feel safe.

265
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:39,672
Then take Sandra out by surprise.

266
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:41,232
But I don't know what.

267
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:43,065
Us against Tai?

268
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,936
Tai is the perfect lure,

269
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:46,538
because it is dangerous.

270
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:48,507
He is very good at finding idols,

271
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:49,983
and he is very sneaky.

272
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:51,480
He goes in all directions.

273
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,678
Working with a guy like that makes me nervous.

274
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:56,823
So even if we're actually targeting Sandra,

275
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:59,584
dating Tai may seem plausible.

276
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,731
Sandra gives me the chips.

277
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:06,581
Oh, she scares me.

278
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:08,998
She should be the first to go.

279
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:10,195
Do not you think?

280
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,263
We are in a precarious situation.

281
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:14,174
On the one hand,

282
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,243
we give the name of Tai to Sandra and Varner,

283
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,278
so that Sandra feels safe.

284
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:19,404
However,

285
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,736
if Tai found out that his name was being mentioned,

286
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:25,005
it could blow us in the face.

287
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,974
Because Tai is known to switch sides.

288
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:28,255
So it's tricky.

289
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,875
If we merge, I don't want to deal with her.

290
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,517
If she leaves, I'm happy.

291
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:35,587
In the past, I found idols, changed sides.

292
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:38,456
I'm afraid they'll think I'm the most dangerous.

293
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:41,034
They say the plan is to get Sandra out,

294
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,836
but there is always a risk

295
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:45,505
let them surprise me first.

296
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:47,859
So I wanna go get another idol,

297
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,928
in case I'm the target.

298
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:56,092
I found the idol on the Mana camp,

299
00:12:56,217 --> 00:12:58,043
"On my new camp,

300
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,544
we have the same well."

301
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:01,164
Then the same index

302
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,547
could walk here.

303
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:27,451
The cow! I know he's an idol.

304
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:28,982
I didn't even open it.

305
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:32,210
Survivor's god is really watching over me this season.

306
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,594
Having two idols, immense power.

307
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,629
Lots of flexibility.

308
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:43,888
It's crazy.

309
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,393
Come, chickens, chickens!

310
00:13:45,518 --> 00:13:46,690
With two idols,

311
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:49,187
I'm actually more paranoid.

312
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:53,240
All these different levels, the complexity, the options...

313
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,046
Chickens, chickens!

314
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:56,801
I'm really, really nervous.

315
00:13:57,098 --> 00:13:58,477
What to do with them?

316
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:09,133
Today I was at rock bottom.

317
00:14:09,258 --> 00:14:12,050
"Debbie, you're going into exile."

318
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:15,428
My position couldn't be worse.

319
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:19,061
I'm going to be exiled on a ship?!

320
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:27,226
Oh my God!

321
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,772
What's going on?

322
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:32,946
"Welcome to exile"!

323
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:36,949
Exile is not a hell where I will freeze tonight

324
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:38,372
and starve to death.

325
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:40,987
It is a sumptuous yacht.

326
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,433
I play on velvet.

327
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:44,553
I have incredible luck!

328
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,856
Lord God, thank you!

329
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:50,722
"Enjoy your stay in exile!"

330
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:51,897
Count it!

331
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:55,103
"This ship's holds are full of meat,

332
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,536
salad, snacks,

333
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:59,277
sodas, liquor, wine and desserts."

334
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:00,674
Oh my God!

335
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,800
My God!

336
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:03,335
No one saw this coming.

337
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,314
A totally unexpected reversal in my favor.

338
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,440
Oh my God!

339
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,935
Never, ever,

340
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,649
they will only imagine this

341
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:19,525
is what happens to me.

342
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:21,895
They will all take pity on me,

343
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,189
because I would have endured that, I would have frozen.

344
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,867
Miam miam miam!

345
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:32,038
No one expects me to be treated like a queen.

346
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,407
I can do with that.

347
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:36,795
No tribe, it's true!

348
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,778
It's Debbie's tribe.

349
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:51,735
What happens now?

350
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,654
Can I join you?

351
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:57,831
Cochran?!

352
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,190
Oh my God!

353
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:05,726
Cochran?!

354
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:07,284
Oh my God!

355
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:08,776
It is perilous.

356
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,560
What are you doing here?

357
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:14,543
In addition to this most unexpected exile,

358
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:16,311
here comes Cochran!

359
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,711
I have met presidents, prime ministers,

360
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:21,261
it takes a lot to shake me up.

361
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:23,790
But meeting one of my favorite winners

362
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:25,602
was an honor and a privilege.

363
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:26,755
Literally,

364
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,192
I couldn't stop laughing, smiling, freaking out.

365
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:32,585
I am part of your exile experience.

366
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,720
Oh my God!

367
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,258
I'm here to help you think, talk strategy,

368
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:39,669
discuss the rest of the game.

369
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,097
It helps to have an outside perspective.

370
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:44,373
My God, this is the best of exiles!

371
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:45,908
We will never do better!

372
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:48,002
When I saw it was Debbie, I thought,

373
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,140
"Okay, if I'm here to advise her,

374
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:51,830
it's going to be hard."

375
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:53,875
Because what I saw of his 1st participation,

376
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,653
it's that she claims to be an expert in everything.

377
00:16:56,778 --> 00:16:58,312
So I had my work cut out.

378
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:00,089
It must be a little scary

379
00:17:00,214 --> 00:17:01,883
to be separated from the tribes

380
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:03,889
and ignore what is happening on the camp.

381
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,428
Actually no.

382
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:07,430
I am extremely confident.

383
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:09,666
From my perspective, if I were you...

384
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,669
You don't know what's going on. The game changes from day to day.

385
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:14,044
Hour by hour!

386
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,507
Yes, and you cannot participate in these changes.

387
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:20,410
Do you have fears, reservations about people?

388
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:22,945
Uh no.

389
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,480
At first sight,

390
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:26,862
it was obvious that one of his main faults

391
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:28,576
was overconfidence.

392
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:32,288
She seemed convinced that everything would be fine for her.

393
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:35,632
Overconfidence and sense of security

394
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:38,328
are poisons in this game.

395
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,024
For me, it's jumping off my couch into the TV,

396
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:43,691
"No, no, Debbie, don't say you're super good!

397
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:46,169
No, no, we are never in such a good position!"

398
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:48,638
Is there tension with anyone?

399
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:51,507
Only with Brad Culpepper. Really?

400
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:54,002
I ended up exploding on him.

401
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:55,778
It really screwed him up.

402
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:57,279
I saw its first season.

403
00:17:57,404 --> 00:17:58,939
He looked like a hothead

404
00:17:59,064 --> 00:18:01,048
who would perhaps internalize his annoyances.

405
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:04,227
So you blew up on her right before you cut them off

406
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:07,122
and he can now calmly sit down and say to himself,

407
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,470
"What is Debbie...? I'm Brad Culpepper!"

408
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:11,232
"They don't call me a wanker!"

409
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,987
"They don't call me a wanker!"

410
00:18:13,112 --> 00:18:15,757
So that would worry me.

411
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:19,058
I would try to fix things, not to overdo it.

412
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:23,527
You have to know how to swallow your pride and flatter people's egos.

413
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,241
That in itself is a strategy.

414
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:26,634
It will make you win.

415
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:29,181
Flatter his ego. I will follow your advice.

416
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:31,314
I'm talking with a guy

417
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:34,809
who has not only played 2 times. He went all the way, the 2nd time.

418
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:36,044
Cochran won.

419
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:37,921
I could tell her anything

420
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:40,114
and he really supported me.

421
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,590
That may well have been the greatest benefit

422
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:44,794
of this experience.

423
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,763
There is one last thing.

424
00:18:46,888 --> 00:18:49,290
I have one last surprise for you.

425
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:51,436
Oh my God! In the context of your exile.

426
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,094
In this bag. Oh my God!

427
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:56,777
I present this to you. Oh my God!

428
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,942
A choice of advantages.

429
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:02,082
Oh my God! My turn to say it!

430
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,552
It's been a really tough two weeks, mate.

431
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,607
I understand.

432
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:09,621
I have to get up. Cochran, you know what it is.

433
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,603
What state are you in! You are going to be in a great place.

434
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:13,968
Everything will be alright.

435
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:17,518
You might be in the best position now, Debbie.

436
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,731
This may be the turning point for you.

437
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:25,134
I cry, because I impregnate you with my pestilence.

438
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,909
Do not worry. I will burn these clothes.

439
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,043
My God.

440
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:33,937
So I offer you this.

441
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:36,537
“You will soon join a new tribe.

442
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:40,131
Choose the perk you find most useful."

443
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,919
Just when I think it couldn't be better,

444
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,855
I can choose from this box a benefit

445
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,857
among three.

446
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:50,307
"Fake Immunity Idol Kit.

447
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:55,398
Everything needed to make a splendid, but false idol."

448
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:57,198
"Additional vote.

449
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,737
An extra vote can come in very handy."

450
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:03,767
"Advantage for the tribe in a test.

451
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:05,041
Your new tribe

452
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,316
will have an advantage at the next immunity test."

453
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:10,547
It's a big decision.

454
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:12,607
I take the extra vote. Good.

455
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,552
Go for the extra vote.

456
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:16,720
The additional vote is a certainty.

457
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:20,122
It's like having someone 100% reliable

458
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:22,692
who will vote for sure like me.

459
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:25,061
We're going to stuff the ballot box!

460
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:27,962
It has been an honor, a privilege and a pleasure.

461
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:29,532
And a pleasure for me too.

462
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:31,190
I'm excited to see the sequel.

463
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,536
It seems to me... You have this advantage,

464
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,424
you are determined, you are well placed,

465
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:37,765
you're going to go back and tear everything up. You will ensure.

466
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,495
If Debbie gets hold of what we talked about

467
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,638
and move forward with this new mindset,

468
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:46,713
I think she has the potential to go far.

469
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:55,714
Zeke...

470
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,828
When I pulled the minority bandana, yesterday,

471
00:20:57,953 --> 00:20:59,651
I got a little over it.

472
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:02,463
I know it's scary. I experienced that.

473
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:05,908
Especially having played twice without ever reaching the jury.

474
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,906
It's the storm rumbling above my head.

475
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:11,169
I readily admit it,

476
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:12,673
I like Jeff.

477
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:14,133
I love her so much.

478
00:21:14,258 --> 00:21:16,235
We got quite close.

479
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:19,413
And even if we're going to take Sandra out without him knowing,

480
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:21,006
I see in Jeff Varner

481
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:23,284
a potentially desperate person

482
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:26,820
whom I could trust and save.

483
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,595
But first, I have to convince him that Tai is leaving.

484
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,139
I'm all the way down

485
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:34,399
So I play dead hoping for the best.

486
00:21:34,524 --> 00:21:36,732
I don't think you're all the way down, Varner.

487
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:37,858
Really?

488
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:39,792
I'll tell you.

489
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:42,049
If it was up to me,

490
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:43,722
Tai would leave.

491
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:46,408
I don't trust him.

492
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:50,010
You can't imagine my relief when I hear that.

493
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,978
He's too dangerous. Far too dangerous.

494
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,539
As soon as he finds one,

495
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:55,714
It's finish.

496
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:58,385
Zeke and I are going to lay down on the beach.

497
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,288
And within five minutes, Sandra and I,

498
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:03,015
we are no longer at the bottom of the scale.

499
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,814
Zeke is afraid of Tai,

500
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:07,494
for he would find an idol while sleeping.

501
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,855
We need to get rid of this as soon as possible.

502
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,765
I'm in 1000%.

503
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,891
Good, cool.

504
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,905
I didn't think it would be so easy.

505
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,597
And I'm still not sure I trust him fully.

506
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,541
But at this point,

507
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,014
I do not have a choice.

508
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:23,744
Good, see you later.

509
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,977
What did you talk about with Zeke?

510
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,552
We got closer.

511
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:36,457
And he said he wanted Tai out.

512
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:39,159
"I want to fire Tai now."

513
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:40,410
So...

514
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:41,929
We are calm.

515
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:43,497
warn me this

516
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:45,566
that they want to target Tai.

517
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:48,685
And as long as it's not me, I'll vote for Tai without batting an eyelid.

518
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,728
Most...

519
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:51,705
Inside me, I say to myself

520
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,079
that it doesn't stick.

521
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:55,801
They'd be stupid not to fire Varner or me.

522
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:57,269
Winning is the only way

523
00:22:57,394 --> 00:23:01,348
to make sure that we are not being filled with slack.

524
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:03,751
We'll see what happens in the test.

525
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,699
But if they think I won't take control,

526
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:08,246
they don't know the queen.

527
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:20,768
Over here, everyone!

528
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:36,784
Ready for today's immunity test?

529
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,537
I have the idols, let's go.

530
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:40,713
Today,

531
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,523
you will dive into the water,

532
00:23:42,648 --> 00:23:44,688
pass through a squirrel cage.

533
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,496
Then you will place heavy puzzle pieces in a sled.

534
00:23:48,745 --> 00:23:52,233
You'll pull it down to the finish.

535
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:56,235
Three people will then solve a puzzle of barrels.

536
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:59,640
The first tribe to finish wins immunity,

537
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:01,075
is out of the vote.

538
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,712
The losers, on the board, someone will be the sixth person

539
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,205
removed from the game,

540
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,482
and his tribe

541
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:08,941
will host Debbie

542
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,752
as a new member.

543
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:11,953
Big stakes.

544
00:24:12,078 --> 00:24:13,420
A minute of organization

545
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:14,795
and we start.

546
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,263
Well, on and go.

547
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:24,390
For immunity. Survivors, ready?

548
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:27,501
Go!

549
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,505
Ozzy is waiting for the end

550
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,165
to take a deep dive.

551
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,267
Everybody

552
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,279
must reach the platform.

553
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:40,300
Then, one by one, you will cross the squirrel cage.

554
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:41,499
Come on, friends!

555
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:42,842
The Nuku help each other.

556
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,118
Go on! Ahead!

557
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:45,611
The Mana help each other.

558
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,789
Culpepper takes off.

559
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:49,589
Mana takes the lead.

560
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:52,975
Culpepper quickly reaches the other end.

561
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:54,554
Go ahead, Sierra!

562
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:56,196
Like that.

563
00:24:57,714 --> 00:24:58,765
This is Ozzy.

564
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:00,368
Its good!

565
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:02,169
Sierra passed.

566
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,504
Ozzy is in the water. Varner rushes forward.

567
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:07,174
Mana are very effective.

568
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:09,176
Here is Troyzan for Mana.

569
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:10,469
It passed quickly.

570
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:14,233
Sandra takes a lot of time for Nuku.

571
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:15,841
Come on, Sandra, it's good!

572
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:18,544
Hali crosses quickly.

573
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:22,256
There are many Nuku members left.

574
00:25:22,506 --> 00:25:24,574
Mana still leads.

575
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:26,597
This is Michaela.

576
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:29,564
The Mana passed the squirrel cage.

577
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,058
Come on, friends!

578
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:34,201
Tai catches up quite a bit of time.

579
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:37,739
Culpepper et Sierra

580
00:25:37,864 --> 00:25:39,529
are going to raise the coins for Mana.

581
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:40,933
Ready? One. Two...

582
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,379
Zeke is nearing the finish.

583
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,114
The gap is closing.

584
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,569
Brad, we have to go back up!

585
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:50,042
The Mana have their pieces.

586
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,086
Its good! Pull and push!

587
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,855
These parts are heavy.

588
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,981
Here, here!

589
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:58,459
The Mana are on the second set of coins.

590
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,527
The Nuku on the first.

591
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:01,961
Get ready to push!

592
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:04,364
Nukus are very fast

593
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:05,524
and efficient.

594
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,335
Get ready to push!

595
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,160
More than one for the Mana.

596
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:12,939
The Nuku are getting closer,

597
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:14,567
on the way to the 2nd series.

598
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:16,677
The advance evaporates.

599
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:18,470
We stick to them!

600
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:21,315
The Mana have all their pieces.

601
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:25,211
Nuku is hot on their heels.

602
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:26,812
Watch out for his foot!

603
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:28,655
Now you have to use

604
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,891
the logs

605
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,692
to move the sled

606
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:32,918
until arrival.

607
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:34,495
The sand is too hard

608
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,866
to move forward otherwise.

609
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,799
The Nuku have all their puzzle pieces.

610
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:40,735
Can they get there?

611
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,071
Can they go up?

612
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:43,829
I shoot, but it does not advance.

613
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:47,541
Nice teamwork of the Mana with the logs.

614
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:48,810
Carry on!

615
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:50,503
The Nuku close the gap.

616
00:26:53,198 --> 00:26:54,707
We need the back log.

617
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:58,380
Nothing easy there!

618
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:01,804
This sled and these parts weigh their weight.

619
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:05,092
Good job!

620
00:27:05,764 --> 00:27:07,118
We hurry, come on!

621
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:10,022
Oh my God!

622
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:11,062
Carry on!

623
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:13,092
Want it? This is where you deserve it!

624
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:14,218
Same here!

625
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,471
Nobody wants to go to the council.

626
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:19,507
1, 2, 3!

627
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:24,887
At the top of the slope, you may be able to pull it through the sand.

628
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:26,079
Let's go!

629
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:27,280
Oh, hisse!

630
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:28,574
Go on!

631
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:29,751
On continue!

632
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:30,984
Go on! Go on!

633
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:34,354
The Mana did the hardest part,

634
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:35,580
the steep part.

635
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:41,195
Its good!

636
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,622
Unload the parts!

637
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:45,832
On and go! On and go!

638
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,566
...three, come on!

639
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:49,302
The Nuku continue

640
00:27:49,427 --> 00:27:51,029
to strive to reach the finish.

641
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:52,330
The council is watching.

642
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:53,640
PUSH!

643
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,622
Sierra, Cirie and Aubry

644
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:58,345
are going to solve the puzzle for Mana.

645
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,138
I need a back room here.

646
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:01,874
We are almost there!

647
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:04,261
This one goes here.

648
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:05,545
Oui.

649
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:09,156
It's good, Nuku! Unload the puzzle pieces!

650
00:28:10,507 --> 00:28:12,627
Here, everything will be played on the puzzle.

651
00:28:12,752 --> 00:28:13,786
Quick quick!

652
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:15,888
Yes yes!

653
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:18,257
Which trio will collaborate best?

654
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:19,759
Let's remove a few.

655
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:23,069
Yes! Jeff! Jeff!

656
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,039
The Mana think they are done.

657
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:27,575
It would be one of the quickest resolutions

658
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,044
of Survivor story puzzle.

659
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,211
And it's good!

660
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,900
Mana wins immunity!

661
00:28:34,025 --> 00:28:35,650
Safe from the council.

662
00:28:35,775 --> 00:28:36,943
What happened?

663
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:44,358
Mana, congratulations.

664
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:46,052
Immunity is yours.

665
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:47,829
Thanks, Jeff.

666
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:49,749
Good job.

667
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:52,358
Take your things, return to camp. Enjoy your free evening.

668
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:54,334
No one will leave Mana.

669
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:57,962
Move.

670
00:28:58,087 --> 00:28:59,373
Advice.

671
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:02,227
Someone will be the sixth person eliminated from the game.

672
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:05,038
And immediately after, Debbie will join your tribe

673
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:06,739
and will return to camp with you.

674
00:29:06,864 --> 00:29:09,342
Take your things, return to camp. See you tonight at the council.

675
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,519
I hated this test.

676
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:12,852
End to end.

677
00:29:13,102 --> 00:29:14,487
But I'm not moving from here.

678
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:16,290
Tai is leaving tonight.

679
00:29:16,415 --> 00:29:17,750
Unless he releases an idol.

680
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,693
I hope that will not be the case.

681
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:48,377
It was pretty bad.

682
00:29:48,502 --> 00:29:50,679
The immunity test has knocked us down.

683
00:29:50,804 --> 00:29:53,157
We got our asses kicked.

684
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:54,992
My only consolation,

685
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:58,596
is that we have an opportunity to eliminate Sandra.

686
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:02,558
She is perhaps the most dangerous player in Survivor history.

687
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:04,834
So she has to go.

688
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:07,271
And as long as Varner and her

689
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:09,940
think Tai is going out, everything should be fine.

690
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:15,767
We did well.

691
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:19,735
I will release it without hesitation.

692
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:22,953
In three participations,

693
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:26,355
This is the first time I feel like it could go wrong.

694
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,625
warn me this

695
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,026
that Tai is going to sort out.

696
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:30,741
But I do not believe it.

697
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:33,898
So I can't just hope for the best.

698
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:36,801
I have to assess the situation and work my magic.

699
00:30:37,163 --> 00:30:38,869
You're smart, you know the game.

700
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,399
You know the game.

701
00:30:40,524 --> 00:30:41,472
At the merger,

702
00:30:41,597 --> 00:30:44,041
the last thing you'll need,

703
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,610
it's having Debbie, Tai and Aubry together.

704
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:50,114
I advanced the scenario of the trio of Kaôh Rông.

705
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,555
Aubry is still there,

706
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,991
Debbie is still there, Tai is still there.

707
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:56,326
You could say that they are not great friends,

708
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:57,955
but in the end,

709
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,692
these people have a unique bond. They were in the same season.

710
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:05,087
And when we participate in such a game, generally,

711
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:06,956
we stick to what we know.

712
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:08,319
I do not like it.

713
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:10,426
You are a very strong woman.

714
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:12,136
Sarah too.

715
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:13,694
You are a very strong man.

716
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:16,795
And if you need help, protection,

717
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,910
I keep my eyes open, I'll let you know what's going on,

718
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:22,004
where is the group, who is after you,

719
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:24,248
who says what about you.

720
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:25,608
Can I help you.

721
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:28,352
For now, everyone loves you.

722
00:31:28,602 --> 00:31:31,455
But when it goes into a spin, it's every man for himself,

723
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,624
it is you who will jump.

724
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:35,359
It's always the same.

725
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:37,461
You know that. You lived it.

726
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:40,734
If Sandra won twice,

727
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,167
is that it does not appear

728
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,169
as the most dangerous.

729
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:48,566
It almost seems to me that by talking to people like this,

730
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:50,140
she coaxes us.

731
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:52,720
She doesn't pressure you

732
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:54,573
never raise your voice,

733
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:56,113
she is calm,

734
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:59,116
and little by little, it draws you in.

735
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:01,285
Sandra is so good

736
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,269
I was seriously considering it.

737
00:32:03,394 --> 00:32:05,394
But we vote for Sandra. Sure.

738
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:08,058
Everyone votes for Sandra. OK.

739
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:10,461
Even Varner? No. He doesn't suspect a thing.

740
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,714
He thinks it's Tai.

741
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:16,233
I don't want her to go any further in the game,

742
00:32:16,483 --> 00:32:19,036
but I agree with much of what he said.

743
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:21,259
Sur... Le trio de Kaoh Rong.

744
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:23,312
That they go too far is very...

745
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:26,844
We all know Tai is sneaky and unpredictable.

746
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,593
I'm starting to get very nervous.

747
00:32:42,718 --> 00:32:45,362
I believe I am left out of certain discussions.

748
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,631
I'm not very smart

749
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:49,533
compared to all these dangerous people,

750
00:32:49,658 --> 00:32:50,668
like Ozzy

751
00:32:50,793 --> 00:32:51,843
and Sandra.

752
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,355
They are very good at plotting and scheming.

753
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,655
It's not my way of thinking.

754
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,834
So I get nervous when they walk away.

755
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,035
The friends...

756
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,900
I'm freaking out a bit. Why?

757
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:04,217
Everyone has disappeared. Don't worry.

758
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:05,975
I mean, easy voting.

759
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:07,284
It's easy.

760
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,911
Sandra.

761
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:11,947
You are not leaving. For sure.

762
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:14,683
That's what we decided.

763
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:16,714
She charms everyone.

764
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,787
I don't want her to merge.

765
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:21,799
Tai has put his foot in the dish.

766
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:24,358
He just told Varner that we all voted for Sandra.

767
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:26,470
"What the fuck is he doing?"

768
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,965
It was stupid.

769
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,222
It was useless.

770
00:33:29,347 --> 00:33:30,599
It didn't make any sense.

771
00:33:30,724 --> 00:33:32,643
Did you tell Varner we were voting for Sandra?

772
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:35,871
I didn't mention any of your names.

773
00:33:36,462 --> 00:33:37,782
Everything is fine.

774
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:39,975
I have full faith in you.

775
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,986
But it's still a little stressful.

776
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:43,946
Sandra has won twice.

777
00:33:44,071 --> 00:33:46,207
So we have to eliminate it.

778
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:49,118
But I feel that I run a risk.

779
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,695
But I can't get paranoid.

780
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,289
I have two idols,

781
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:54,857
then I should get away with it.

782
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:57,192
Did he say why he wanted me out?

783
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:58,607
Or just "Sandra"?

784
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,560
Queen Sandra.

785
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:02,440
Arriving,

786
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:04,633
I knew I was the biggest target.

787
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:07,678
And now Tai says they're after me.

788
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:09,805
I'm going to act like I'm going to leave.

789
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,240
At tonight's council,

790
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:13,117
it's about making Tai

791
00:34:13,242 --> 00:34:14,610
or public enemy number one.

792
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:17,121
I'm going to trap him in the wide widths.

793
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:20,146
I will turn the situation around and he will leave.

794
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:38,133
If this is your first advice, take a torch,

795
00:34:38,258 --> 00:34:40,010
immerse it in the fire

796
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:41,512
and turn it on.

797
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,986
Now here's Debbie,

798
00:34:49,111 --> 00:34:50,713
who returns from the island of Exile.

799
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:53,157
She will join your tribe

800
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:54,858
after this advice.

801
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,561
Andrea.

802
00:34:57,686 --> 00:34:59,255
Sixteenth day of Game Changers.

803
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,023
What is the state of the game?

804
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:02,317
so far,

805
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:04,493
it is above all a question of taking out the most dangerous.

806
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:07,413
"Well, that's how this season is going.

807
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,504
Let's find the next threat to come out."

808
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:10,775
And yet, Ozzy,

809
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,502
there aren't really any people here who aren't dangerous.

810
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,479
So are there people

811
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:16,879
who are you hesitating between?

812
00:35:17,004 --> 00:35:19,308
Every day, I hesitate between people.

813
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,719
In the end, we can fit in

814
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:23,445
with a huge target, like me,

815
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,658
because others can jump before me.

816
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:31,572
The hesitation is permanent.

817
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,564
Sandra, he was watching your back.

818
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,334
It's been a great 16 days, Jeff.

819
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:39,437
But that's the end of the road for me.

820
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:40,771
Really?

821
00:35:40,896 --> 00:35:43,040
I arrived in the new Nuku tribe

822
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:45,300
at the bottom of the ladder, and in three days,

823
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:47,744
nobody talked to me about strategy.

824
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:51,982
So you haven't heard any names, nothing at all?

825
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:53,630
I didn't hear any names.

826
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:56,411
I assumed they saw me as a big player.

827
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,222
This.

828
00:35:58,347 --> 00:35:59,757
You were staring at Sandra

829
00:35:59,882 --> 00:36:01,558
while she was talking.

830
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,355
What she said is pretty accurate.

831
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,733
So you think she's going to leave tonight.

832
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:12,236
I wouldn't say that,

833
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:15,039
because I'm also worried tonight.

834
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:16,232
Why?

835
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,342
I blew up Malcolm,

836
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,578
I did a big game changer.

837
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:21,994
So...

838
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,513
Yes I...

839
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:29,511
Tai. You seem lost in thought.

840
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:31,155
I am paranoid.

841
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,080
These are names of weight,

842
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:35,384
like Sandra and Ozzy.

843
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:36,959
And I'm nervous.

844
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:38,854
What was the question?

845
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:39,964
Sorry.

846
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:42,491
I believe you answered it. I do not know.

847
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:43,759
Everything is possible.

848
00:36:43,884 --> 00:36:45,594
I just hope to be safe.

849
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,937
So Sarah.

850
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:49,440
Sandra says no one talks to her.

851
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:51,498
Didn't you hear any names either?

852
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:53,410
Yes, a few.

853
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:55,846
And I believe

854
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:57,372
that on arriving at the council,

855
00:36:57,497 --> 00:36:59,393
some of us are undecided.

856
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,592
Tai, hence your nervousness.

857
00:37:02,202 --> 00:37:05,055
I thought, only one name, Sandra.

858
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:08,124
But Sarah says others have been brought up

859
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:10,227
which I am not aware of.

860
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:13,597
So I don't know what's going on. I thought we were all together.

861
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:14,723
Now...

862
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:15,849
Who knows?

863
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:17,868
Sandra. That's what you want to hear.

864
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:19,970
If Tai wants to give a name,

865
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,740
as long as it's not me, I'll vote with you, Tai!

866
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:27,429
Can I do it secretly?

867
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:29,413
Whisper in my ear!

868
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,215
OK.

869
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:34,552
As long as it's not me. Don't whisper my name!

870
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,297
OK?

871
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:48,733
Yeah. I will do it.

872
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:49,859
Ozzy.

873
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,393
Ozzy.

874
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:55,079
But we need one more person.

875
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:56,365
How to proceed?

876
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,642
We are only three.

877
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,702
We must be four. I need one more.

878
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:00,936
Wow.

879
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:03,672
Want to tell us? I am going to tell you.

880
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,286
I named Ozzy.

881
00:38:13,282 --> 00:38:16,594
I remain in the tradition of coming out the strongest.

882
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:19,063
I am no match for him. It's a god!

883
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:21,866
He does everything so well. He knows how to dive

884
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:23,567
hold your breath, swim...

885
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,469
He knows how to do everything, so well!

886
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,339
I can't beat him in the test.

887
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:31,303
And the merger is coming soon.

888
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:32,735
In two votes, maybe.

889
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,910
This.

890
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:35,646
So it's time and...

891
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,378
Now everyone is talking.

892
00:38:37,503 --> 00:38:39,174
Well, why not?

893
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:40,887
Do you agree to vote Tai?

894
00:38:41,012 --> 00:38:43,799
We are small. He's a tough guy.

895
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:46,624
Let's act!

896
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:48,225
Finally, it's up to you.

897
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,518
You know me loyal.

898
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:51,387
Tai, I have a question for you.

899
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:53,055
Who do you trust?

900
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,357
'Cause you keep telling me you trust me

901
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:57,001
and Sarah,

902
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,602
in Andrea

903
00:38:58,727 --> 00:38:59,728
and an Ozzy.

904
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:01,418
I may want to vote with you.

905
00:39:01,543 --> 00:39:03,164
But how to trust you

906
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,768
if I don't know who you trust?

907
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:10,523
And I also know that you are always looking for idols.

908
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,950
It's not me looking for idols all the time.

909
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:22,927
I don't know Tai.

910
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,821
Can we just vote?

911
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:28,123
I am ready. I'm ready.

912
00:39:28,248 --> 00:39:30,515
Looks like I'm ready. I am ready.

913
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:33,938
Good. It's time to vote.

914
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:35,397
Andrea, over to you.

915
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:45,149
For the love of God, what a tragedy!

916
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,545
Tai. You are an idiot.

917
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,220
You mentioned my name.

918
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:53,958
But to attack me is to sign his death warrant.

919
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,258
The queen remains queen. Bye!

920
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:15,538
I will count the votes.

921
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:24,989
If anyone has an immunity idol and wants to play it,

922
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:26,749
now is the time to do it.

923
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,564
Good. Once the votes have been read, the decision is final.

924
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:36,634
The eliminated person will leave the board immediately.

925
00:40:36,759 --> 00:40:38,093
I will read the votes.

926
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,263
Premier vote,

927
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:43,432
This.

928
00:40:46,035 --> 00:40:47,436
Tai. Two Tai votes.

929
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:51,772
Sandra.

930
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:59,348
Sandra. Equality. Two Tai votes,

931
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:00,716
two votes Sandra.

932
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:06,764
Sandra. That's three Sandra votes.

933
00:41:10,997 --> 00:41:13,003
Sixth person eliminated...

934
00:41:13,128 --> 00:41:15,865
Sandra. Four is enough. Bring me your torch.

935
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,377
I wish you good luck.

936
00:41:20,627 --> 00:41:22,479
It doesn't matter. Tear it all up!

937
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:29,286
Sandra,

938
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:32,757
for the first time in 94 days of Survivor...

939
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:34,025
The tribe has spoken.

940
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,393
Don't, Jeff, don't!

941
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:44,426
Good luck! The Queen!

942
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,813
It's time to go. Okay.

943
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:48,939
Goodbye.

944
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:51,033
Goodbye, Sandra! Goodbye, Sandra!

945
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:57,348
One more time,

946
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,049
I have not got the faintest idea

947
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:00,759
of what just happened.

948
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:03,521
I'm starting to get used to this feeling.

949
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,647
Debbie.

950
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,018
A torch and a Nuku bandana will be waiting for you at the camp.

951
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:09,126
Others,

952
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:11,086
take your torches, return to the camp.

953
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:12,290
Good night.

954
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:26,510
Stay with us, to see a preview of the next episode.

955
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:29,048
Next time in Survivor...

956
00:42:29,718 --> 00:42:31,851
The Mana are reaching their breaking point.

957
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:33,409
This game...

958
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:34,797
is hard.

959
00:42:35,145 --> 00:42:36,654
Alliances implode.

960
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:39,058
I am furious. It might not be you.

961
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:40,732
And Varner sees an opening.

962
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:42,885
I have to shift the focus to someone else.

963
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,386
I want to take Ozzy out.

964
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:46,497
Maybe it's time to be done with Ozzy.

965
00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:48,765
Jeff was finally able to extinguish my torch.

966
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,111
But I did fine during those 16 days,

967
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,191
considering I'm a double winner.

968
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:54,964
I owe a lot to Survivor.

969
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,329
I love Survivor, from the bottom of my heart.

970
00:42:57,454 --> 00:42:58,702
I don't want to cry,

971
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:01,552
but I know why I have the life that I have.

972
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:02,970
It's thanks to Survivor.

973
00:43:03,095 --> 00:43:05,045
There will never be another double winner,

974
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,517
only the queen.
