<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,631
Although there were only five

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,049
Heroes left, they appeared to be

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,634
a tight-knit group.

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,677
>> Best team on<i> Survivor</i>

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,177
right here.

8
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,429
>> PROBST: But their unity was

9
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,513
only an illusion because when

10
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,056
J.T. found a hidden immunity

11
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,559
idol, Amanda and Candice decided

12
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,060
he wasn't as trustworthy as

13
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:19,811
they thought.

14
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:20,270
>> J.T.'s the slimiest

15
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,938
guy out here.

16
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,981
>> PROBST: The Heroes had also

17
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:23,606
convinced themselves that the

18
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,692
Villains tribe was completely

19
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,651
controlled by women.

20
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,235
>> Sure looks like they got

21
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,111
a woman's alliance.

22
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,196
>> PROBST: But there was no

23
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,030
women's alliance.

24
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,699
>> The Hero tribe thinks this is

25
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,616
an all-girl alliance.

26
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,118
They think I'm on the outside,

27
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,536
when I'm the leader.

28
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,996
>> PROBST: In fact, two of the

29
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,414
women, Sandra and Courtney, were

30
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,582
in the greatest danger.

31
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,166
>> We're the ones on the outs.

32
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,001
>> PROBST: When the Villains

33
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:43,877
lost their fourth challenge

34
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,669
in a row...

35
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,546
Heroes win immunity!

36
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,380
(Heroes cheer)

37
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,131
...Courtney was the next to go.

38
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,508
But Sandra made a brilliant move

39
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,551
to save her friend.

40
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,969
She convinced Russell that Coach

41
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,306
had turned on him.

42
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,474
>> Russell's so stupid.

43
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,685
He ate that crap up.

44
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,562
>> PROBST: Her plan worked.

45
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,313
Courtney was spared,

46
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,939
and Coach was voted out...

47
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,191
Coach, the tribe has spoken.

48
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,358
...leaving Jerri without

49
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,318
her closest ally.

50
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,152
11 are left.

51
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,363
Who will be voted out tonight?

52
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,126
We went to Tribal Council and

53
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,295
we went ahead and voted out

54
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,380
Coach because I told Russell

55
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,007
that Coach was going to vote

56
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,342
for him.

57
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,053
And that's why Coach is probably

58
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,221
now out there looking into the

59
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,430
sky wondering where everything

60
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,306
went wrong.

61
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,183
>> I didn't see that coming

62
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,643
at all.

63
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,269
I had no idea that Coach was

64
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:43,686
gonna go tonight.

65
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,313
Not a clue.

66
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,149
I'm not next, am I?

67
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,651
>> No way, no way, no way.

68
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,401
>> Oh, God.

69
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,361
>> You have my word.

70
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,112
I will not write your name down,

71
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:53,530
I promise you that.

72
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,031
Obviously, it was last-minute,

73
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,574
and I didn't want to tell you

74
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,867
'cause I didn't want to freak

75
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,868
you out.

76
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,869
>> Okay.

77
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,954
>> Don't worry.

78
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:01,538
>> Yeah... I don't want to be

79
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,247
next.

80
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,248
>> You're not going to.

81
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,249
(Jerri laughs)

82
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,709
>> Coach was my one and only

83
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,670
serious alliance.

84
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,337
I mean, he's the only person

85
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,090
out here I trusted, so I'm still

86
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,675
going to stick true to the

87
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,801
alliance that I created with

88
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,927
Russell, Parvati and Danielle,

89
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,512
but at this point, that's all I

90
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:22,433
got.

91
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,476
>> So, what happened?

92
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,769
>> You didn't know it was going

93
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,020
to happen?

94
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,313
>> I had a strong feeling that I

95
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,648
wasn't going to write his name

96
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,649
down.

97
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,818
Coach betrayed me by telling

98
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,528
Sandra that he was trying to

99
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,529
blindside me tonight.

100
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,989
>> I just wanted to make sure

101
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,115
that I wasn't next...

102
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,199
>> No, I... I promise you, you

103
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,200
ain't next.

104
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,286
>> Okay.

105
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,829
>> You see, we got five girls

106
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,997
on my tribe now.

107
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,248
I feel great about it, because

108
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,167
I trust three of them.

109
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,586
But I don't trust Sandra and

110
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,296
Courtney, so they'll be the next

111
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,547
to go.

112
00:02:52,630 --> 00:03:00,388

00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,254
statement.

195
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:50,224
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

196
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,309
Heroes getting your first look

197
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,436
at the new Villain tribe.

198
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,813
>> PROBST: Coach voted out at

199
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,023
the last Tribal Council, and

200
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:57,648
Coach became the first member of

201
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,819
our jury.

202
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,279
Rupert, what's the reaction to

203
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,447
seeing it's Coach that is now

204
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,448
gone from the game?

205
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,449
>> Phew!

206
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,867
Cannot believe Coach is gone,

207
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,868
you know.

208
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,036
But that women's alliance looks

209
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,204
very strong.

210
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,205
It's kind of obvious.

211
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,790
>> PROBST: J.T., obvious to you

212
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,832
guys it's a woman's alliance?

213
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,125
>> I would have bet my life

214
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:16,751
Russell or Coach-- one was going

215
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,460
to be gone.

216
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,503
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

217
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,629
ready to get to today's reward

218
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,630
challenge?

219
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,631
(all voicing assent)

220
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,050
For today's challenge, you will

221
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,469
use your arms to brace yourself

222
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,346
between two walls while your

223
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,639
bare feet are perched on very

224
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,725
narrow footholds.

225
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,477
Every ten minutes, you will move

226
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,270
to an even smaller foothold.

227
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,772
Once you reach the third and

228
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,065
final foothold, you will stay

229
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,900
there for as long as you can.

230
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,735
Each person will be matched up

231
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,028
against someone from the

232
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,238
opposite tribe.

233
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,031
All you have to do to score a

234
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,616
point-- outlast your opponent.

235
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,535
First tribe to score three

236
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,662
points wins reward.

237
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,082
>> PROBST: Want to know what

238
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,083
your playing for?

239
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,084
(all voicing assent)

240
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,877
Well, it's clear you all like to

241
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,045
live adventurously, so let me

242
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,338
tell you what is at stake.

243
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,173
The winning tribe will receive

244
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,386
a feast from Outback Steakhouse.

245
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,263
>> ALL: Oh!

246
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:10,763
>> Bloomin' onion, baby!

247
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,514
>> PROBST: Steak, shrimp on the

248
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,515
barbie...

249
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,516
>> Oh!

250
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,517
>> PROBST: ...loaded baked

251
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,063
potato with all the fixings.

252
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,398
So much food from Outback

253
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,858
Steakhouse, you will not be able

254
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,859
to eat it all.

255
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,193
(Rupert laughs)

256
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,070
This morning in your treemail,

257
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,446
you were asked to rank your

258
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,157
tribe to determine our matchups,

259
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,740
and in doing so, Villains, you

260
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,616
decided who you were sitting

261
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,617
out.

262
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,618
Russell sitting out this

263
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,619
challenge.

264
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,663
Take a spot on the bench.

265
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,747
Everybody else, take your

266
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,748
positions, and we'll get

267
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,877
started.

268
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,717
Some interesting match-ups.

269
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,178
Danielle and Candice.

270
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,179
>> Yeah.

271
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,346
>> PROBST: Courtney taking on

272
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,347
Amanda.

273
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,558
Parvati taking on J.T., who won

274
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,934
this in the Tocantins.

275
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:57,935
>> Hey, Colby.

276
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:58,936
>> Hi, Jerri.

277
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,937
>> PROBST: A rematch-- Jerri

278
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,190
Manthey, Colby Donaldson-- going

279
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,568
all the way back to season two.

280
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,320
And another rematch-- Sandra and

281
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,614
Rupert going back to the Pearl

282
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,866
Islands, our seventh season.

283
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,867
>> Love you.

284
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,202
>> PROBST: Go ahead and head on

285
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,244
up.

286
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:15,786
First round is ten minutes.

287
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,789
You can't use your back, your

288
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,833
butt, your hips, your shoulders.

289
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,460
Forearms are totally fine.

290
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,836
If you want to lean your head

291
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,879
against it, if that helps,

292
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:25,880
that's okay.

293
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,881
Everybody's looking good right

294
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,882
now.

295
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:28,883
(Jerri exhales loudly)

296
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,386
This challenge is officially on.

297
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,387
Both ranked your tribe,

298
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,848
theoretically, from strongest to

299
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,476
weakest, but judging from the

300
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,353
fact that J.T. is in the middle,

301
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,479
I'm guessing there was some

302
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,063
strategy about who the other

303
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,106
tribe was going to put up, and

304
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:44,732
that affected the positions you

305
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,609
chose.

306
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,694
Since you're resting comfortably

307
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,696
early on in this challenge, we

308
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,115
have a little bit of a

309
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:53,616
celebration to note.

310
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,661
Today marks the one hundredth

311
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,788
day that Amanda has played

312
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,789
<i>Survivor.</i>

313
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,250
First person to get to 100 days.

314
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,543
>> Yay!

315
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,671
>> You go, girl.

316
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,515
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

317
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,976
move down to the next smaller

318
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,811
foothold.

319
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,647
Five, four...

320
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,650
three, two, one.

321
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,362
Everybody looks good.

322
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,822
All you have to do is outlast

323
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,323
your opponent, and you score a

324
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,324
point.

325
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,159
First to three wins the Outback

326
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,160
Steakhouse reward.

327
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,662
>> I love Outback Steakhouse.

328
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,331
Before my husband left to

329
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,292
Afghanistan, that whole week,

330
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,293
twice we went there.

331
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,294
>> PROBST: Really?

332
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,295
>> That's his spot.

333
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:47,878
>> PROBST: So if you win, not

334
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,839
only are you going to get a full

335
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,840
belly, you got some emotional

336
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,968
attachment there.

337
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,977
>> The fact that J.T. thinks

338
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,353
this is an all-girl alliance

339
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,147
gives me a perfect opportunity,

340
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,773
once we merge, to make him think

341
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,774
I'm flipping.

342
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,817
I done planted that little

343
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,110
Russell seed in their mind, and

344
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,486
it's taken root, and they

345
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,615
believe it.

346
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,623
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

347
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,083
to move down to the third and

348
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,085
final foothold.

349
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,628
If you fall off during this

350
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,838
time, you are out of the

351
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,298
challenge.

352
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,591
We could lose somebody right

353
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,676
here.

354
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,886
>> This peg is little.

355
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,806
>> PROBST: Three, two, one.

356
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,975
Everybody's in position.

357
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,310
This is where you're going to

358
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,603
stay for the rest of the

359
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:45,895
challenge.

360
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,064
Your feet are now perched on a

361
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,357
foothold that is about a

362
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,816
quarter-inch wide.

363
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,651
Now, it's going to get a little

364
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,652
tougher.

365
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,112
It'll start to hurt a little

366
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,405
bit.

367
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,533
Everybody's got to dig deep.

368
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,829
(Colby panting)

369
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,790
Colby readjusting, trying to

370
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,792
find a sweet spot, somewhere

371
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,794
that doesn't hurt.

372
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,712
Once it starts to hurt, it's

373
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:18,552
tough to get rid of the pain.

374
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,429
Colby drops out.

375
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,306
Jerri scores the first point for

376
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,765
the Villains.

377
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,183
Jerri can step down.

378
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,518
>> Hells yeah.

379
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,268
>> PROBST: Don't lose your

380
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,019
concentration.

381
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,978
>> Come on, girls.

382
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:28,938
>> PROBST: Jerri scores for the

383
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:29,230
Villains.

384
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,191
Villains now have one point.

385
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,776
You only need three.

386
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,903
Parvati readjusting now.

387
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,904
(exhales)

388
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,198
Rupert fighting through the

389
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,449
pain.

390
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,743
Rupert with a broken toe.

391
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,203
Trying to hold on.

392
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:44,745
>> Hang on Sandra.

393
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,039
You popped out some babies; this

394
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,165
ain't nothing.

395
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,500
>> Two of them-- didn't even get

396
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:49,834
a aspirin.

397
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,335
(laughs)

398
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,170
Two natural births.

399
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,296
>> Yeah, you got it.

400
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,132
>> Be strong, Rupe.

401
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,133
>> PROBST: Beads of sweat

402
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,843
pouring off of Rupert's face.

403
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,301
>> You got it, Rupe.

404
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,762
You got it, buddy.

405
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,138
Get in the zone.

406
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,098
>> PROBST: Rupert slobbering

407
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,434
now, he's struggling so hard.

408
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,185
Rupert is out of the challenge.

409
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,520
Sandra can step down.

410
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,646
>> One more minute.

411
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,981
>> PROBST: Villains now have two

412
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:12,731
points.

413
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,107
(laughs)

414
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,024
>> Sorry, guys.

415
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:14,942
>> PROBST: The Villains need

416
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,403
just one more point.

417
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,866
If J.T., Amanda or Candice fall

418
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,242
out of this challenge before

419
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,327
their opponent, it's over for

420
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,705
the Heroes.

421
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,998
Parvati readjusting again,

422
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,002
trying to find some way to ease

423
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,378
the pain.

424
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,088
Amanda struggling a bit.

425
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,047
>> Courtney, yep.

426
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,299
She's shaking, Courtney, she's

427
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:38,924
shaking.

428
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,134
>> PROBST: It could come down to

429
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,720
this: Courtney versus Amanda.

430
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,096
They played this game together

431
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,346
in China.

432
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,474
>> Courtney, hold on, Courtney.

433
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,057
>> PROBST: Amanda needs to dig

434
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,977
deep right now.

435
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,694
Amanda drops out.

436
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,987
Villains win reward!

437
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,362
(excited shouting)

438
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,239
>> Oh, my God, oh, my God!

439
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,324
Are you crying?

440
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,619
(laughs)

441
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,037
Nice work.

442
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,164
(laughs)

443
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,917
>> PROBST: Heroes, after four

444
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,335
straight wins, got nothing for

445
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:14,502
you.

446
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,085
Grab your stuff, head back to

447
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,670
camp.

448
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,796
>> Bye, guys.

449
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,714
(laughs)

450
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,382
>> Wah-mbulance.

451
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,217
>> PROBST: All right, Villains,

452
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,884
congratulations.

453
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,135
Grab your stuff, head out and

454
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,178
enjoy it.

455
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,305
>> Thank you.

456
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,610
(ice rattling)

457
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,611
>> Cheers.

458
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,237
>> To winning.

459
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,238
>> Yay!

460
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,113
>> Cheers, Villains.

461
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,114
>> Cheers.

462
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,533
>> Oh, my God, that's so good.

463
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,033
>> Villains forever.

464
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,034
>> Whoo-hoo!

465
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,537
>> This is delicious.

466
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,996
(sucking air through straw)

467
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,164
>> You're ready for another one,

468
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,290
Sandra.

469
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,083
>> Sandra, is that their cue?

470
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,084
>> You were drinking it?

471
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,877
Sandra put one down.

472
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,878
>> Come here, homie.

473
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,922
Give me that, homie.

474
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,465
>> Yeah!

475
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,758
>> My husband is a soldier in

476
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,926
the army, and I kind of felt bad

477
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,886
I was without my husband because

478
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,264
I'm sure he wishes he was at

479
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,391
Outback Steakhouse, too, because

480
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,475
we just love Outback.

481
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,727
We always go to Outback, but,

482
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,271
you know, he's got to do his job

483
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,730
and I got to do what I have to

484
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,773
do out here on<i> Survivor.</i>

485
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,482
>> Oh, my God.

486
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,191
>> Thank you, Lord, for this

487
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,192
meal.

488
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:20,901
>> Thank you so much, Lord.

489
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:21,235
>> Thank you.

490
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,027
>> Wow.

491
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,028
>> Yay.

492
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:23,946
>> I've been wanting a salad for

493
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,947
ages.

494
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,199
>> Oh, my God, I'm using a

495
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,075
napkin.

496
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,704
(overlapping chatter)

497
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,372
So after the drinks, we go and

498
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,083
our table is set and, you know,

499
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,668
everyone is just diving into

500
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,253
their salads, and I picked up

501
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,005
the napkin and, like, flicked it

502
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:41,964
open, and this little, tiny

503
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,008
rolled up clue was inside my

504
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,092
napkin, and I was like, "Oh, my

505
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,094
gosh, I hope no one saw that."

506
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,012
I, like, stuffed it in my

507
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,055
underwear as fast as I could.

508
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,974
>> Oh, my stomach just said

509
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,226
thank you.

510
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,436
>> Wow.

511
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,437
>> This is so good.

512
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,730
You know, I knew it was a clue

513
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,647
to a hidden immunity idol.

514
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,649
I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I am

515
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,151
crazy lucky because I sat in the

516
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,278
corner next to Danielle and I'm

517
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,238
super lucky that it was in my

518
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,239
napkin."

519
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,282
>> If and when the merge

520
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,284
happens, all those guys over

521
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,577
there think that it's a girl

522
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,162
alliance.

523
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,455
It's just so funny that they

524
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,289
assume that.

525
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,957
>> Rupert, too, all the time,

526
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,958
he's like, "That all-female

527
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:18,542
alliance looks really strong."

528
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,793
>> He's like, "It's pretty

529
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:20,878
obvious.

530
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,297
It's so obvious.

531
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,090
I'd stake me pirate life on it."

532
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,091
>> Arr!

533
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,384
(laughter)

534
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,385
>> Perfect.

535
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,470
All the Heroes see is an all-

536
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,472
women's alliance.

537
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,514
First of all, there's no all-

538
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,892
girl alliance, and second of

539
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,894
all, Russell's running the show.

540
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,519
They have no idea what's going

541
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,315
on over here, and it's awesome.

542
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,568
(laughs)

543
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,028
>> Mmm.

544
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,279
>> There you go.

545
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,280
Look at that.

546
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:48,530
Thank you.

547
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,114
>> Yeah.

548
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,116
>> Thank you.

549
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,035
Anything you wanted, the Outback

550
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,036
way.

551
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,037
>> Wow.

552
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,622
>> More shrimp and salad.

553
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,623
>> We're happy now.

554
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,916
>> I'm gonna eat enough food for

555
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,958
everybody.

556
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,959
>> This is good.

557
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:01,627
>> It's really good.

558
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,211
>> Oh, my God.

559
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,879
>> Mmm.

560
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:04,463
>> The best steak and potatoes

561
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,091
I've ever had in my whole life.

562
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,092
>> I'm definitely finishing it.

563
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,301
>> Yeah.

564
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,511
Guys, I'm full already.

565
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,512
>> You're full?

566
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,179
>> I'm full.

567
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:12,429
>> Oh, no.

568
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,806
>> I have to pee, though.

569
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,099
I'm gonna get out.

570
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:25,651
<i>Pardon moi.</i>

571
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,778
Danielle.

572
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,659
My napkin.

573
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,952
>> How did nobody else see you

574
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:35,536
get that?

575
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,620
>> I don't know, I just, like,

576
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,830
found it in my napkin and it

577
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,872
fell into my lap and I just

578
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,415
shoved it in my underwear.

579
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,292
>> Oh, my God.

580
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,547
>> "Another immunity idol is

581
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,089
hidden at your camp.

582
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,133
You want it in your possession,

583
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,551
but it does you no good if you

584
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,885
don't know when to use it."

585
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,595
I shared the clue with Danielle

586
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,263
just so Danielle knows, like,

587
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,264
I'm on her side.

588
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,307
I want Danielle to feel tighter

589
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,517
with me than she does with

590
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,101
anyone else.

591
00:16:59,184 --> 00:16:59,685
>> You don't have a pocket or

592
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,269
anything?

593
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,646
>> No, but I can put it in my

594
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,647
boobs.

595
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,190
>> It was kind of a part of my

596
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,025
plan to make Danielle feel

597
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,986
really connected to me, so that

598
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,279
at the end of the game, she

599
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,947
feels more loyal to me so that

600
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,240
she'll protect me over Russell.

601
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,241
>> All right, perfect.

602
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,242
>> All right, potty break.

603
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,410
>> I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

604
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,202
>> We'll fill Russell in on a

605
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,997
need-to-know basis, and right

606
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,581
now Russell doesn't need to

607
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:25,377
know, so he's not going to know.

608
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,756
>> You know what?

609
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,425
I don't give a damn about steak.

610
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,093
I've eaten at least a thousand

611
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,137
steaks in my time.

612
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,097
(chuckles)

613
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,640
So I'm not gonna worry about a

614
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,308
damn steak when we got a game to

615
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,852
play, you know?

616
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,478
To hear that there were steaks

617
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,481
up for grabs was tough because,

618
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,774
you know, I live off steaks.

619
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,357
I raise cattle.

620
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,442
I cut my own steaks up, you

621
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,443
know.

622
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,360
We eat black angus beef right

623
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,362
off the farm.

624
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,614
But we didn't come out here to

625
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,198
win steaks.

626
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,491
We came out here to win the big

627
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,492
prize.

628
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,868
If we win this next immunity

629
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:02,080
challenge...

630
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,665
I got a plan.

631
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,292
>> Uh-oh, J.T.'s got a plan.

632
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,252
>> Let's hear it.

633
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,504
>> The next immunity challenge

634
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,964
guarantees us the finals.

635
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,674
>> Let's hear the plan.

636
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,967
>> But we're relying on the

637
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:14,968
merge.

638
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,762
I bet my life in this game on it

639
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,222
that we're going to merge.

640
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,141
Russell knows he's going next.

641
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,269
So, granted I get a chance to

642
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,688
talk to Russell at the next

643
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:31,652
immunity challenge and we win, I

644
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,070
give him the hidden immunity

645
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,280
idol, he votes out Parvati...

646
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,992
bam, done.

647
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,285
>> How are you gonna give it to

648
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,119
him, though?

649
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:41,703
>> Hand it to him.

650
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,621
>> Wrapped up with a sheet of

651
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,247
paper with instructions on what

652
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,500
to do with it.

653
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,126
Parvati's gone.

654
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,336
>> Then pick the girls off.

655
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,379
>> Pick 'em off like sitting

656
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,381
ducks, then vote Russell's ass

657
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,091
out sixth.

658
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:54,716
>> I think it's really crazy to

659
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,385
give Russell the idol.

660
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,428
You don't know what's going on

661
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,429
over there.

662
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,973
He could be in with the girls

663
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:01,640
for all we know.

664
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,642
Like, we don't know.

665
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,935
What do you think about this

666
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,770
idea?

667
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,313
I mean, it could give us the

668
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,191
numbers and it gets the idol

669
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,819
away from him.

670
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:43,265
He just gives it up.

671
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,267
>> "Cross over the bridge to the

672
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,103
dancing trees."

673
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,563
Dancing trees?

674
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,106
>> Let's go look and see if any

675
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,233
look like they're dancing.

676
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,526
Danielle and I woke up this

677
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,777
morning and we're like quiet

678
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,237
little mice running around

679
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,280
because there's an immunity

680
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,281
idol hidden at our camp and we

681
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,242
didn't want Russell to see us.

682
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,494
>> Dancing... tree.

683
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,079
>> It's those right there, right

684
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,331
there.

685
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,332
You think?

686
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,292
>> Yeah.

687
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,293
Yeah.

688
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,920
>> They look like they're

689
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:13,921
dancing.

690
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,005
All right, so I guess look right

691
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,006
here.

692
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,425
>> Yeah.

693
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,558
It could be behind this.

694
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,728
It could be over here, too.

695
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,407
>> (laughing): Oh, my God.

696
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,617
>> What?

697
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,910
>> Oh, my God, we just found

698
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,411
that in, like, four seconds.

699
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,955
Here, hold this so I can cover

700
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:48,413
it up.

701
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,750
>> Nice.

702
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,460
>> We found the idol.

703
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,754
I am the happiest girl in the

704
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,089
world that I found that idol

705
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,091
because it gives me control of

706
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,468
the game right now.

707
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,637
This is a big deal.

708
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,180
Oh, my God, I can't believe we

709
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:06,181
have that.

710
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,265
And I'm not going to tell

711
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:07,975
Russell about the idol right

712
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:08,976
now.

713
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,269
I want Russell to be out of the

714
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:10,727
loop for a little bit.

715
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,353
I don't see anything wrong with

716
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,938
making him wait.

717
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:13,522
I really don't.

718
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,439
It doesn't mean I don't trust

719
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,440
him.

720
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,358
It's just...

721
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,651
I kind of want to see him squirm

722
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,360
a little bit.

723
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,697
It's fun.

724
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,699
(both laugh)

725
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,033
It's not all Russell running the

726
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,034
show around here.

727
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,286
He is not the king of<i> Survivor.</i>

728
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,621
I'm the queen.

729
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,872
(laughs)

730
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,165
And usually the king does what

731
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,002
the queen says anyway, so I'm

732
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,420
cool.

733
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,860
>> You're writing your letter to

734
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,153
Russell, buddy?

735
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,530
>> Yep.

736
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,118
"Russell, this is a huge turning

737
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:08,577
point in this game.

738
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,578
This is not fake.

739
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,496
I wouldn't waste your time

740
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:11,747
or mine.

741
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,082
Just by competing against you

742
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,208
and the few handshakes we've

743
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,126
had, I feel like I can

744
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,127
trust you.

745
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,295
Play the idol tonight and

746
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,296
save yourself.

747
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:19,921
All the girls should be writing

748
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,923
your name down, so act like you

749
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,133
know you're going home.

750
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,593
I think you should write

751
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,802
Parvati's name down to send

752
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,887
her home.

753
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,430
We will most likely merge at

754
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,765
ten people, and then you will

755
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,349
be completely safe with us.

756
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,559
Our five plus you will remain

757
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,769
strong until the girls are

758
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,853
done with.

759
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:35,604
We can then work on getting

760
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,482
ourselves into the final three."

761
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,025
>> This is your chance to show

762
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,026
you're not a villain.

763
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,027
>> I'll put that at the end

764
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,028
right here.

765
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,405
>> Good.

766
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,615
Oh, my gosh.

767
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,116
>> It could work, y'all.

768
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,909
If that works, it would be

769
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,826
incredible.

770
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,994
I'm really nervous.

771
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,162
I mean, I'm always nervous, but

772
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:52,788
I'm really nervous today because

773
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,538
I'm going to try the big

774
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,456
plan today.

775
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,042
>> If it all works, it's a

776
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,543
great plan.

777
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,545
>> If we win, I'm going to try

778
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,506
to give Russell my hidden

779
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,508
immunity idol, based on me

780
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,803
guessing that he's on the outs,

781
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,888
which I really feel like he is.

782
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,348
All right, this is our chance.

783
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,516
That will give us the numbers

784
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,059
going into the merge.

785
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:14,643
So, it's all up to us.

786
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,522
We have to win.

787
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,780
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

788
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,457
You guys ready to get to today's

789
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,667
immunity challenge?

790
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,668
>> Oh, yes.

791
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,669
>> PROBST: First things first.

792
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,004
Candice-- give it up.

793
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,383
(Jeff chuckles)

794
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,676
Once again, immunity is back up

795
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,636
for grabs.

796
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,138
For today's challenge, both

797
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,848
tribes will start on a platform

798
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,266
floating in the water.

799
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,143
On my go, one member at a time

800
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,353
must move a bag of puzzle pieces

801
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,021
along a rope and through a

802
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,064
series of obstacles to your

803
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,274
finish mat.

804
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,067
Once you have all five bags, you

805
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:04,693
will use those puzzle pieces to

806
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,028
build a totem pole.

807
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,780
The first tribe to assemble it

808
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,699
correctly wins immunity, and

809
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,575
everybody on that tribe is

810
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:15,203
guaranteed a one-in-ten shot at

811
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,746
winning a million bucks.

812
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,956
Losers go to Tribal Council

813
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,999
where somebody's shot at that

814
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,292
million will come to an end.

815
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,334
Villains, you have one extra

816
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,335
person.

817
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,461
You sat out Russell last time.

818
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,629
Who is going to sit out this

819
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,756
challenge?

820
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,843
>> PROBST: Sandra, take a spot

821
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,844
on the bench.

822
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:31,845
Everybody else, take your spots.

823
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,973
We'll get started.

824
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,020
Here we go, for immunity!

825
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,063
Survivors ready?

826
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,401
Go!

827
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,986
Jerri for the Villains, and

828
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,905
Rupert for the Heroes.

829
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,448
Little different from some of

830
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,699
the other challenges in that you

831
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,743
are not attached to the rope,

832
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,328
just a bag of puzzle pieces.

833
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,329
(indistinct shouting)

834
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,997
Jerri now with a bit of a lead

835
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,498
for the Villains.

836
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,500
Just barely.

837
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:01,917
>> Come on, Rupert!

838
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,626
>> PROBST: Those bags take on

839
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,711
some water, they get a little

840
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,712
heavier.

841
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,255
Rupert now in the lead for the

842
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,256
Heroes.

843
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,257
>> There you go!

844
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,426
(indistinct shouting)

845
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,427
>> Come on, Rupert!

846
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,428
(whooping)

847
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,804
>> PROBST: Rupert flying through

848
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,805
this course now.

849
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,806
Jerri slowing down.

850
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,807
>> That's okay, Jerri!

851
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,808
Keep going!

852
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:19,726
>> PROBST: You don't want to

853
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,727
lose your lead early.

854
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,728
(indistinct shouting)

855
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:25,690
You may never catch up.

856
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,235
>> Come on, Rupert!

857
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:28,860
>> PROBST: Rupert heading to the

858
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,820
finish with that first bag for

859
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,821
the Heroes.

860
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,822
>> Run, Rupert! Run!

861
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,823
>> Go, Rupe!

862
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,824
Go, Rupert!

863
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,619
>> PROBST: Go, Heroes!

864
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,621
J.T. in the water for the Heroes

865
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,123
with that second bag.

866
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,124
>> Go, Jerri!

867
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,167
>> PROBST: Jerri now heading to

868
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,460
the finish for the Villains with

00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,544
their first bag.

870
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,545
Go, Villains!

Danielle in the water for the

872
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,924
Villains.

873
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,758
J.T. going to be hard to catch

874
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,219
right now.

875
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,929
Danielle doing a nice job for

876
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:56,930
the Villains.

877
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:57,639
She's definitely made up some of

878
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,641
the time that Jerri lost.

879
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,727
>> Come on, Danielle!

880
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,813

00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,878
end for the Villains with her

899
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:29,879

908
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,267

(thunder crackling)

928
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,786
Rain starting to come down now

929
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,704
in the middle of this challenge.

930
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,207

(indistinct shouting)

941
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,888
Russell is going to have to be

942
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,889
Superman out there.

943
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,016

Start working on your puzzle.

Russell doing his best to make

949
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,401

954
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,406
>> Get it up, man.

955
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,157
>> PROBST: Heroes making quick

956
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,325
work of this puzzle.

957
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:22,784
>> Go, Russell!

958
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,414
>> PROBST: Heroes very close.

959
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,415
(thunder rumbling)

960
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,416
Heroes win immunity!

961
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,417
>> Yeah!

962
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,838
(whooping)

963
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:35,839
>> Good job, Russell.

964
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:36,840
>> Good job, guys.

965
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,841
>> Would you like your dinner?

966
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,842
>> Cocktails...

967
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,970
(overlapping chatter)

968
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,897
>> PROBST: Heroes,

969
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:53,898
congratulations once again.

970
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:54,899
>> Yeah, baby!

971
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,900
>> Yes!

972
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,901
>> Good job.

973
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,902
>> No problem.

974
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,903
>> PROBST: For the third

975
00:28:58,987 --> 00:28:59,904
straight time, Heroes win

976
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,905
immunity.

977
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,990
No tribal Council.

978
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,032
Everybody's safe.

979
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,534
Villains, after 24 days, one of

980
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,869
you going home tonight.

981
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,162
You have the afternoon to figure

982
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,455
out who it's going to be.

983
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,622
Grab your stuff, head back to

984
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,623
camp.

985
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,624
I will see you tonight at

986
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,625
Tribal.

987
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,168
>> Now, I don't even have to

988
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,003
find idols.

989
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,087
People are actually giving me

990
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,339
idols.

991
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,717
You don't hand the enemy the

992
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,969
idol, especially when his name

993
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,220
is Russell Hantz.

994
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,555
You don't do that.

995
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:29,184
That's a no-no.

996
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,691
(bird squawking)

997
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:37,984
>> Damn, we did it, and we got

998
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,903
the idol out to Russell, and we

999
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,780
know he's going to be on our

1000
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,115
side.

1001
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,325
(sighing)

1002
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:49,662
Serves them damn Villains right.

1003
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,830
We'll make<i> Survivor</i> history with

1004
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,831
this one today, guys.

1005
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,832
>> I think so.

1006
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,833
>> Yeah.

1007
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,834
(Rupert laughing)

1008
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,461
>> With Russell getting that

1009
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,003
hidden immunity idol, he's

1010
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,880
probably beaming with

1011
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,382
excitement.

1012
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,552
Russell is probably having

1013
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,970
trouble containing himself right

1014
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,014
now.

1015
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,015
(Parvati laughing)

1016
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,226
>> "Russell, read in complete

1017
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,227
privacy."

1018
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,896
(Parvati laughing)

1019
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,190
"This is a huge turning point in

1020
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,191
this game.

1021
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:18,942
This is not fake.

1022
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,194
I wouldn't waste your time or

1023
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,195
mine.

1024
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,696
Hopefully, we are on the same

1025
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,739
page.

1026
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:25,740
Play the idol tonight."

1027
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:26,741
>> For sure.

1028
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:27,742
>> "To save yourself..."

1029
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:28,743
>> Save myself?

1030
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,786
>> Because clearly, you're on

1031
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,120
the outside of an all-devouring

1032
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,247
female alliance.

1033
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,248
>> Right.

1034
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,041
>> I put that part in myself.

1035
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,252
"All the girls should be writing

1036
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,795
your name down, so act like you

1037
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:39,796
know you're going home."

1038
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,421
I can't believe he's writing all

1039
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,089
this, like...

1040
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,132
>> He's telling me what to do.

1041
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,133
He's-He's giving me pointers.

1042
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,135
How do you give the idol king an

1043
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,136
idol?

1044
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,304
"Here, Mr. Russell.

1045
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,305
Here's an idol.

1046
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,348
This one's just for you."

1047
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,349
Well, thank you.

1048
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,350
You know what?

1049
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,185
I think J.T. just handed me one

1050
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,520
million dollars.

1051
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,104
Hey, I guess he can afford it.

1052
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,897
>> "I think you should write

1053
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,940
Parvati's name down and send

1054
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,941
her home."

1055
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:00,942
(Parvati laughs)

1056
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,068
Why is everyone throwing me

1057
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,236
under the bus?

1058
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,654
They don't even know what's

1059
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,655
going on over here.

1060
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,656
Okay.

1061
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,282
"Our five plus you will remain

1062
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,200
strong till the girls are done

1063
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,201
with."

1064
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,202
>> "We can..."

1065
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,662
>> "We can then work on getting

1066
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,705
ourselves in the final three."

1067
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,707
>> Wow, wonder what that means.

1068
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,708
>> Big promises, J.T.

1069
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,709
>> Yeah.

1070
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,918
>> "Hopefully, I can trust you,

1071
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,338
and you're not truly a villain."

1072
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,339
>> Yes, I am.

1073
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,340
>> "Let's do this together.

1074
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,049
See you soon."

1075
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,050
B.F.F., forever.

1076
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,051
(both giggling)

1077
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,052
X.O.X.O.

1078
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,053
>> Love you.

1079
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,096
>> "J.T.

1080
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,139
Destroy this right when you

1081
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,349
finish reading."

1082
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,350
(laughter)

1083
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,351
Oh, my God.

1084
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,478
Oh, my God, I can't believe he

1085
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,689
wrote you a letter.

1086
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,734
Why would you hand a villain

1087
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,735
your heart?

1088
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,278
J.T. gave Russell his heart

1089
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,739
today, and Russell is just going

1090
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:51,576
to stab it a million times, a

1091
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,910
million times over, and hand it

1092
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,537
to me, and I'm going to eat it.

1093
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,538
(laughing)

1094
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,831
What are we, in fifth grade?

1095
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:57,832
He's passing notes?

1096
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:58,833
>> Wrote me a letter.

1097
00:31:58,916 --> 00:31:59,876
>> What is wrong with him?

1098
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,210
Like, I cannot believe that kid

1099
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,171
won.

1100
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,467
>> Whatever. Ignore them.

1101
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,843
There's nothing we can do now.

1102
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:09,844
Well, this sucks, Sandra.

1103
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:10,845
I'm sorry.

1104
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:11,929
They're all in control, and

1105
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:12,930
we're now scrambling like

1106
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:13,931
cockroaches.

1107
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,224
>> Look, that's how I was in my

1108
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,225
season.

1109
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,226
I was al... We were always in

1110
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,227
control of everything.

1111
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,228
>> So was I on mine.

1112
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,229
And you know what?

1113
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,230
Tables turn.

1114
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,482
>> This is what we get for being

1115
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,484
bitches.

1116
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,027
Me and Courtney-- you know,

1117
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,571
our morale is really low 'cause

1118
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,031
it's inevitable that me or

1119
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,491
Courtney are going home, and I'm

1120
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,494
really sad, because me without

1121
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,371
Courtney-- that's like rice

1122
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,038
without beans, you know?

1123
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,207
So it's up to Danielle, Parvati

1124
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,500
and Russell who they're going to

1125
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,169
vote out.

1126
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,422
>> Yeah, Courtney.

1127
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,423
>> Simple?

1128
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,424
>> Simple.

1129
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,425
>> Parv?

1130
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,636
>> Yeah?

1131
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,429
>> Done deal.

1132
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,430
>> Done deal.

1133
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,807
Now that we lost the challenge

1134
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,808
today, we can get rid of

1135
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,475
Courtney.

1136
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,518
I don't trust Courtney or

1137
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,602
Sandra.

1138
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,144
But I don't like Courtney,

1139
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,146
'cause I think she'll flip.

1140
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,440
>> So are they gonna vote for me

1141
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,358
or Sandra?

1142
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,359
>> I don't know.

1143
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,902
I don't know what to do, because

1144
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,986
I wanted to keep you forever.

1145
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,987
You know?

1146
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:10,988
>> I know.

1147
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,490
I mean, the only thing I can say

1148
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,199
to you is that if we have five,

1149
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,451
and if I'm there, Amanda is more

1150
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,452
likely to come with us.

1151
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,453
>> Yeah.

1152
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,454
>> Because she trusts me.

1153
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,455
Do you know what I mean?

1154
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,456
>> Mm-hmm.

1155
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,457
>> That's my only perk.

1156
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,458
'Cause I would stay with you.

1157
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,459
Well, whatever.

1158
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,460
That's my argument for me.

1159
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,461
I'm not going to throw Sandra

1160
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,462
under the bus.

1161
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,463
I wouldn't vote for her, either.

1162
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,464
So I'm just going to vote for

1163
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,173
Jerri, I guess, and whatever

1164
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,968
happens, happens.

1165
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:32,969
>> Look, you would definitely

1166
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:33,302
stay with me?

1167
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,054
>> Yeah.

1168
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,181
>> Things are going to go crazy

1169
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,559
as soon as we merge, because

1170
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,727
it's five-five.

1171
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,145
As long as I know you'll stick

1172
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,021
with me, then I'll do what I can

1173
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,022
do to keep you.

1174
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:45,398
>> I'm... I'm...

1175
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,274
>> But you have to be with me.

1176
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,275
(laughter)

1177
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,276
Courtney and I have become

1178
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,277
really close, and, uh, I don't

1179
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,278
know.

1180
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,196
I want to keep Courtney here,

1181
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,489
because I feel like, once

1182
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,115
there's a merge, she would stay

1183
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,074
more loyal to me than to

1184
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,202
Russell.

1185
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,790
I want to keep myself kind of

1186
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,208
lower key on this one, because

1187
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,211
if I try to save her too much,

1188
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,129
people are going to think, "Oh,

1189
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,381
she has something on the side

1190
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,508
with Courtney."

1191
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,509
(Parvati laughs)

1192
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,635
>> They gave him their idol.

1193
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,304
>> J.T. gave me their idol to

1194
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,305
save me tonight.

1195
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,306
>> Shut up!

1196
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,307
>> Oh, my God!

1197
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,559
>> Oh, my God!

1198
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,560
>> Are you dying?

1199
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,561
Are you dying?

1200
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,562
>> Shut up.

1201
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,563
>> Save yourself.

1202
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,731
>> He did not do that.

1203
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,315
>> They just think this girl

1204
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,107
thing is way too strong.

1205
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,276
>> They are so set on the girl

1206
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,028
thing, which is why I want to

1207
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,029
talk to you about Courtney,

1208
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,030
because I think we need to keep

1209
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,157
Courtney tonight.

1210
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,158
>> Yeah.

1211
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,159
>> I just think, Courtney would

1212
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,160
be more likely to stick with us

1213
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,161
than Sandra.

1214
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,162
Do you trust that you have

1215
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,163
Sandra's loyalty?

1216
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,164
>> I don't trust Courtney at

1217
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,165
all.

1218
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,166
I-I think she'll flip, and then

1219
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,167
all of a sudden...

1220
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,002
>> I-I think Sandra will flip

1221
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,003
way before Courtney.

1222
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:49,796
>> All of a sudden, they have,

1223
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,797
uh...

1224
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,589
>> And she's more strategic.

1225
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,715
>> I think they'll both flip, so

1226
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,508
it just comes down to who's more

1227
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,509
threatening...

1228
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,301
>> All of a sudden, you got

1229
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:55,760
Amanda talking to you.

1230
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,344
>> ...as far as who can talk

1231
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,929
better-- Sandra or Courtney?

1232
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,721
>> Sandra, and who makes up lies

1233
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,722
for no reason?

1234
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,098
>> I just think Courtney is

1235
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,099
way more likely to go flip-flop.

1236
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:02,725
>> But then you have to look at,

1237
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,351
like, if she gets to the end,

1238
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,185
Sandra would be harder to beat

1239
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,186
than Courtney.

1240
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,187
>> Courtney would be easier

1241
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,188
to stick to...

1242
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,189
>> To keep track of.

1243
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,191
>> To keep track of.

1244
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,903
>> For me.

1245
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,364
>> I mean, it really doesn't

1246
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,615
matter one way or the other with

1247
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,616
me.

1248
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,784
>> I feel like I can keep

1249
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,868
Courtney in check more than I

1250
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,163
can keep Sandra.

1251
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,472
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1252
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,725
the first member of our jury...

1253
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,060
Coach, voted out at the last

1254
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:49,188
Tribal Council.

1255
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,276
Sandra, at the last Tribal

1256
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,029
Council, trust was once again

1257
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,281
the big theme.

1258
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,907
Is that going to be the case

1259
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,075
again tonight?

1260
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,285
>> To me, it's like when I'm

1261
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,661
sitting in the living room in

1262
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,412
my house, whoever Jeff asks the

1263
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,205
trust question to-- that's the

1264
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,248
last person that should be

1265
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,249
answering that question.

1266
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,250
I'm in trouble.

1267
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,793
I know I am, because Tyson was

1268
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,794
in my alliance.

1269
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,795
He's gone.

1270
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,796
Boston Rob was in my alliance.

1271
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,797
He's gone.

1272
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:15,798
And today, it's between me and

1273
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,799
Courtney.

1274
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,800
One of us two is going.

1275
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,801
>> PROBST: Is that right,

1276
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,802
Courtney?

1277
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,803
Is that what you think, as well?

1278
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,804
It's you or Sandra?

1279
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,097
>> Yes.

1280
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,140
>> PROBST: Russell, is there any

1281
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,641
correlation to the fact that

1282
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,976
Sandra and Courtney are also the

1283
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,228
people who sit out, by far, the

1284
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,105
most often in challenges?

1285
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,523
>> No, not to me.

1286
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,358
It's always that same question--

1287
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,402
who can I trust the most?

1288
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,696
>> PROBST: Danielle, what is it

1289
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,697
about Sandra and her

1290
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,282
trustworthiness or lack thereof

1291
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,575
that has her name coming up

1292
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,618
tonight?

1293
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,578
>> That she's not in my

1294
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,370
alliance, and I've seen how

1295
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,624
she's playing the game, and

1296
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,417
she's able to manipulate people.

1297
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,544
>> PROBST: Give me an example.

1298
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,879
>> Yeah, me, too.

1299
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,213
Give me an example.

1300
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,007
>> Okay, um, I've seen you put

1301
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,216
into people's minds different

1302
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,260
things that maybe weren't true

1303
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,262
just to stir the pot up.

1304
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,513
>> PROBST: But Danielle, the

1305
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,890
question was trustworthiness,

1306
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,432
not big mouth.

1307
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,392
>> Well, that's kind of...

1308
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:12,021
She's just not been on my side.

1309
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,314
>> PROBST: That's just not doing

1310
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,690
what you want her to do.

1311
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,733
>> Me and Boston Rob were

1312
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,276
together from the beginning,

1313
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,861
but then it comes down to me,

1314
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:19,862
because now I'm the one left.

1315
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,863
>> No, no, no.

1316
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:21,489
Rob and you decided to not talk

1317
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,491
to me and pull in Courtney and

1318
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,785
Tyson, and I had nowhere to go.

1319
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,369
So, what was I supposed to do?

1320
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,370
>> That didn't have nothing to

1321
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,371
do with Sandra.

1322
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,372
>> Yeah, but you were a part of

1323
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,373
it, and you didn't make me

1324
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,374
feel like...

1325
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,375
>> Make you feel how, if you're

1326
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,376
running off with Parvati and

1327
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,377
Russell?

1328
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,378
Make you feel how?

1329
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,171
>> Well, you were running off...

1330
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:37,964
>> Why should I come to you and

1331
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:38,756
say hello when you don't come

1332
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,757
and say hello to me?

1333
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,758
>> You were Rob's, like,

1334
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,759
sidekick.

1335
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:42,551
Whatever Rob said to do, you

1336
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,344
went and did, and he said to

1337
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,345
watch...

1338
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:44,929
>> And that's exactly what you

1339
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,388
do with Parvati.

1340
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,181
She's the boss, and you do

1341
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,182
whatever she...

1342
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:48,975
>> But I trust them. I don't...

1343
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:49,767
>> Okay, so there's no

1344
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,768
difference.

1345
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,560
>> She doesn't tell me to do

1346
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,436
anything.

1347
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:52,853
I'm my own person.

1348
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,271
>> And I'm my own person.

1349
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,189
Rob doesn't tell me what to do.

1350
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:55,731
>> Well, it sure didn't look

1351
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,399
like it.

1352
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,193
>> PROBST: So, Parvati, are you

1353
00:37:59,277 --> 00:37:59,527
the boss?

1354
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,529
>> Of course.

1355
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,863
If you ask the Heroes, I'm the

1356
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,156
boss.

1357
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,825
I'm running a crazy women's

1358
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,411
alliance over here.

1359
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,912
>> PROBST: Parvati, what about

1360
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,414
Courtney is not trustworthy?

1361
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,498
>> For me, it's not about

1362
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,708
trustworthiness.

1363
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,209
It's about alliances.

1364
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,669
I mean, in the beginning of this

1365
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,712
game, there was a strong

1366
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,422
division-- Boston Rob's girls

1367
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,756
versus Russell's girls-- and

1368
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,008
Rob's gone.

1369
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:22,717
>> I'll tell you what trust<i> will</i>

1370
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,593
do.

1371
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,095
We had a group of ten.

1372
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,596
We had three people that really

1373
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,724
trust each other-- me, Parvati

1374
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,766
and Danielle-- and we're still

1375
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,767
sitting here.

1376
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,060
That's what trust can do for

1377
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,061
you.

1378
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:34,687
If you really believe it, and if

1379
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,856
it's really true, you can make

1380
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,482
it all the way to the end in

1381
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,608
this game.

1382
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,609
>> PROBST: Courtney, that ring

1383
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,736
true to you?

1384
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,737
>> Yeah, there's a tight

1385
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,155
alliance that formed, and you

1386
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,157
can't hate on the three of them.

1387
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,491
But you know, I stuck with Rob

1388
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,576
when I knew he was going to go,

1389
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,661
and so that was, like, the

1390
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,246
beginning of the end for me and

1391
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:52,872
Sandra's side, which Jerri was a

1392
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,082
part of and Coach was a part of,

1393
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,083
too, in the beginning and then

1394
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,084
it all went...

1395
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,085
>> No, I never asked to be a

1396
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,086
part of that group, not once,

1397
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,087
so...

1398
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,881
>> You didn't vote for Parvati?

1399
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:02,548
>> I was never in anybody's

1400
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,549
alliance, is my point...

1401
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,384
>> All right, well you voted

1402
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,469
against the alliance you're a

1403
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,137
part of now, but you flipped

1404
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,889
just in time to save your butt,

1405
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:10,890
so awesome for you.

1406
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,183
I didn't flip quick enough, I

1407
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,476
guess, and so, that's why me and

1408
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,772
Sandra are in trouble.

1409
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,814
>> PROBST: Well, the stakes are

1410
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:19,815
clearly high.

1411
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,108
Now, it's time to make your

1412
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,109
decision.

1413
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,527
It is time to vote.

1414
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,947
Sandra, you're up.

1415
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,272
I'll go tally the votes.

1416
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,280
Once the votes are read, the

1417
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,281
decision is final.

1418
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:09,865
Person voted out will be asked

1419
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,658
to leave the Tribal Council

1420
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,659
area immediately.

1421
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,704
I'll read the votes.

1422
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,164
First vote...

1423
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,334
Jerri.

1424
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:21,502
Courtney.

1425
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,879
One vote-- Jerri, one vote--

1426
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,882
Courtney.

1427
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,010
Courtney.

1428
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:32,888
Courtney.

1429
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:33,514
That's three votes-- Courtney,

1430
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:37,852
one vote-- Jerri.

1431
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,812
Tenth person voted out and the

1432
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,855
second member of our jury--

1433
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,856
Courtney.

1434
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,857
That's four. That's enough.

1435
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,108
You need to bring me your

1436
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,235
torch.

1437
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,121
Courtney, the tribe has spoken.

1438
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,122
>> Good luck, bitches.

1439
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,123
See you later.

1440
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,124
>> Bye.

1441
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,417
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.

1442
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,418
>> Bye, Courtney.

1443
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,670
>> Bye.

1444
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:10,009
>> PROBST: Well, time will tell

1445
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,719
if you made the right vote

1446
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,803
tonight, but here's one thing

1447
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,597
for sure-- we are now even.

1448
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,224
Five Villains, five Heroes.

1449
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,976
One other note-- congratulations

1450
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:19,977
to Parvati.

1451
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,437
Tomorrow, you will join Amanda

1452
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,688
as the only people to have

1453
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,481
played 100 days in the game of

1454
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,900
<i>Survivor.</i>

1455
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:26,984
>> Thank you, Jeff.

1456
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:27,985
>> PROBST: Grab your torches,

1457
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:28,986
head back to camp.

1458
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,156
Good night.

1459
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,500
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1460
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,667
from our next episode.

1461
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,839
>> PROBST: Next time on

1462
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,840
<i>Survivor.</i>

1463
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,841
>> This ought to be interesting.

1464
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,967
>> PROBST: Five Heroes and Five

1465
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,470
Villains...

1466
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,471
>> PROBST: ...will collide.

1467
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,598
This is where I stand.

1468
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,683
>> They think they have the game

1469
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,726
right now.

1470
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:01,769
>> Whatever Russell says, he's

1471
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,604
lying if he says that the women

1472
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,605
are running the show.

1473
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,606
>> This is where the game gets

1474
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,733
crazy.

1475
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,989
>> I have to say that I am very

1476
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,074
proud of myself.

1477
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,367
This is pretty good for the

1478
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:16,951
little skinny chick to get all

1479
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:17,701
the way to the jury.

1480
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,702
Good for me.

1481
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,746
It's actually one of my<i> Survivor</i>

1482
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,498
dreams to be on the jury and get

1483
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,082
all pretty and make all the

1484
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:23,624
bitches jealous as they sit

1485
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,751
there in their dirty rags.

1486
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,044
I've been really lucky in both

1487
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,045
my<i> Survivor</i> experiences, and

1488
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,880
there's nobody I intensely hate.

1489
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,007
So, good luck everybody.
