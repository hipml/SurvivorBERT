<i>ROMEO:</i>
<i>I just want to say</i>

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,878
I have no hard feelings.
This is a game.

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,446
I'm glad I'm still here.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,948
-Good job, Romeo.
-Thank you for keeping me,

5
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,282
and I still like all of you.

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,751
<i>At Tribal,</i>

7
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,386
three votes were thrown on me

8
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,988
just in case
Chanelle played an idol.

9
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:25,725
So, obviously, I was lied to.

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,995
<i>All these people are fake.</i>
<i>I don't like any of 'em, so</i>

11
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,097
<i>I have</i>
<i>to put on a fake happy smile</i>

12
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,966
<i>and pretend</i>
<i>that it's all good.</i>

13
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,401
"It's all good
if you voted for me."

14
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:37,070
You know, when in reality
I want to, like,

15
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,938
kick 'em in the face.

16
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,740
<i>But that's not smart.</i>

17
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,308
What?

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,843
What's up?

19
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,178
No, I have no idea
who that is.

20
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,180
-I thought so, baby. I-I got it.
-No, I voted for Chanelle.

21
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,283
-I-I know who it is. Thank you.
-Okay.

22
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,219
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>I have not received</i>
<i>a single vote until this Tribal.</i>

23
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:57,023
And then, all of a sudden,
I receive a hinky vote, which...

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,025
Whatever. It's fine.

25
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,829
<i>But now I'm kind of,</i>
<i>like, upset about it,</i>

26
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,799
and I have an inkling
that it came from Romeo.

27
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,601
He, you know, swore
that he's a God-fearing man,

28
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,036
he wouldn't write my name down,
and...

29
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,005
-ROMEO: Hai...
-...there it was.

30
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:15,442
So if you didn't vote for me,
who voted for me?

31
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,210
I don't know. It wasn't me.
I voted for Chanelle.

32
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:21,347
Even if this is my last vote,
I just want to see you squirm.

33
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,284
Does anyone want
to admit to my name?

34
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:29,189
Right. It-it was Romeo.

35
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,459
<i>ROMEO:</i>
<i>Hai is the person who's</i>
<i>instigating everything on cam.</i>

36
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,895
<i>And people are too dumb</i>
<i>to realize it.</i>

37
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,698
And so I threw a vote
his direction

38
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,000
because even though I knew
he wasn't going home,

39
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,470
<i>I knew</i>
<i>that it would make him squir.</i>

40
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,144
<i>I wanted him to freak out,</i>
<i>and I was successful</i>

41
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,147
because now people see
that this man is not all there,

42
00:01:54,214 --> 00:02:00,153
and whoever is aligned
with him is... is... is dumb.

43
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,922
<i>If I get voted off next, fine,</i>
<i>but I'm not getting voted out</i>

44
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,792
<i>without trying</i>
<i>and creating a little chaos.</i>

45
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,995
You have to play this game, and
I'm-I'm going to play this game.

<i>Hey.</i>

47

Okay. Okay, but...

48
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,944
-Well, you asked my opinion.
Can I finish?
-Yes. Go.

49
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,947
Not only
is he creating paranoia.

50
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,949
He can look me in the eye and

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,186
straight-up lie to me.
That's personal.

52
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,489

I mean, yes,
Romeo is an easy gone,

53

-She's first out.
Rocksroy's out.
-(groans)

166
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,940
Omar's out. Mike's out.

167
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,175
Just like that, four are out.

168
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,944
We're down to Hai and Romeo

169
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,779
fighting for immunity
for orange.

170
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,315
Hang in there, Romeo!
Find that balance point.

171
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,784
It is a very rough day
on the water

172
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,085
-here in Fiji.
-I'm out.

173
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,221
Drea's out.
This is going so fast.

174
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,555
Tori's out.

175
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,091
Now it is Lindsay
and Jonathan

176
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,627
fighting for immunity for blue.

177
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,762
Not even a minute yet.

178
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,465
Unprecedented swells

179
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,468
and wind on an already
difficult challenge.

180
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,575
Romeo, you touched. You're out.

181
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,978
Hai, you're good,
but keep fighting.

182
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,012
Hai has immunity.

183
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,681
You want to stay in it now.
Remember,

184
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,416
the last person standing
also wins food.

185
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,822
Lindsay and Jonathan fighting
for immunity and food.

186
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,924
Keep fighting, Hai!

187
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,993
Lindsay, stay in it!

188
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,429
Jonathan hunched over.

189
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,765
You've been out there
only two minutes.

190
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,867
OMAR:
Good job, Hai!

191
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,103
Your life in the game is
on the line right now.

192
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,338
Keep fighting.

193
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,708
Lindsay With a nice recovery.

194
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,377
Hai with a nice recovery.

195
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,017
Jonathan with a nice recovery.

196
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:17,089
Lindsay with another nice save.

197
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,024
Great balance.

198
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,994
That's how you do it!

199
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,933
You want to make the final
eight, you win right here,

200
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,334
and you've done it.

201
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,936
Hai is already in eight.

202
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,004
Who will join him?

203
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,973
Hai is now fighting
for food for his team.

204
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,474
OMAR:
Hai, stay in it.

205
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,976
-(overlapping shouting)
-Hai,

206
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,978
-nice recovery!
-Yeah, Hai!

207
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,015
PROBST:
The wind continues to move

208
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,319
bodies and platforms
all over the place.

209
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,522
Very difficult to do
this challenge on a flat sea.

210
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,300
MARYANNE:
Whoa!

211
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,703
Lindsay can't do it.
Lindsay's out.

212
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,706
Now it's Jonathan
who has won immunity,

213
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,909
and we have a showdown--
Hai and Jonathan.

214
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,386
Hai's out. Jonathan wins
immunity and food for his team.

215
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,723
-(cheering)
-PROBST: Wow!

216
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,957
MIKE:
Great job, Hai.

217
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,393
Amazing effort by everybody in

218
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,261
a very difficult challenge.

219
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,301
All right, two winners.

220
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,869
Hai, come on over.

221
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,170
-(cheering)
-MIKE: Yeah, Hai!

222
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,039
-Come on, Hai.
-(whooping)

223
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,675
-MARYANNE: Yeah!
-ROCKSROY: My man.

224
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,210
And it looks good on you, bro.

225
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,012
You are safe, cannot
be voted out tonight.

226
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,047
Head back to orange.

227
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,049
-Yeah!
-Jonathan, come on over.

228
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,285
-(whooping)
-Yeah, Jonathan, swag, swag!

229
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,255
-MARYANNE: Oh, yeah!
-You've been waiting for this.

230
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,057
I've been waiting.
Come on, Mr. Jeff.

231
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,558
Yeah!

232
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,428
Jonathan also safe tonight
at Tribal Council,

233
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,663
guaranteed a spot
in the final eight.

234
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,599
Head back over. In addition...

235
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,434
-I'm proud of you.
-Jonathan earned

236
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,269
-for his team of five...
-Thank you.

237
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,040
kebabs waiting for you
back at camp, you can cook up

238
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,208
while you go back
to the old Taku camp,

239
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,977
where you will spend
the afternoon.

240
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,478
You will go
to Tribal Council first.

241
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,180
Then you'll go
to Tribal Council second,

242
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,848
and you will
have the advantage

243
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,116
of seeing what just happened.

244
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,185
Big night.
Two people going home.

245
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,354
-I'll see everybody
at Tribal Council.
-JONATHAN: Thank you.

246
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,356
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Hai got the immunity necklac.</i>

247
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,658
I don't have to even worry
about anything today.

248
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,027
<i>I got me, Omar and Rocks,</i>
<i>and Romeo is out.</i>

249
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,029
<i>That's easy.</i>
<i>We got the numbers.</i>

250
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,464
Four to one, we go home.

251
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,811
This is your camp, huh?

252
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,045
HAI:
This isn't that bad.

253
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,980
-It's kind of cute.
-Oh, it got old

254
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,816
-after a while.
-Huh?

255
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,151
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>I never thought I would</i>
<i>ever come back to Taku,</i>

256
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,923
<i>but here I am with Hai,</i>
<i>Rocksroy, Romeo and Mike.</i>

257
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,158
-Wow.
-HAI: Wow. They really
separated our group

258
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,060
-so there's no discussion.
-MIKE: Yeah.

259
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,062
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>And what's interesting about</i>

260
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,064
this configuration is,
Rocksroy boy,

261
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,966
you got your final five
of men.

262
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,135
<i>But who's gonna be</i>
<i>the one out now?</i>

263
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,904
HAI:
So we probably have about

264
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,840
-three to four hours. Yeah?
-MIKE: Yup.

265
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,475
-OMAR: Sure.
-Uh, food-wise,

266
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,976
-you want to take a look?
-Yeah, sure, let's go.

267
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,044
Yeah, let's go.

268
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,412
<i>ROMEO:</i>
<i>This is my worst nightmare.</i>

269
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,080
<i>I mean, I never had anything</i>

270
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,549
<i>in common with Rocksroy,</i>
<i>even though we were aligned.</i>

271
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,184
<i>I have nothing in common</i>
<i>with Mike.</i>

272
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,787
<i>He's like a hundred years old.</i>

273
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,124
<i>And Hai-- we got into</i>
<i>an argument last night, so,</i>

274
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,025
I'm going home.
There's no questions about it.

275
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,727
There's nothing really
that I can do.

276
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,597
Think it's kind of
a no-brainer, but...

277
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,465
Dude, nobody's
getting squirrely,

278
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,634
-so I think it's...
-Yeah.

279
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,103
<i>ROCKSROY:</i>
<i>Fortunately,</i>
<i>I have three of the guys</i>

280
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,139
<i>that I brought together waiting</i>

281
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,940
<i>to go to Tribal right now.</i>

282
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:59,211
Now, during the wait,
is where the dynamics come in.

283
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,946
You ask anybody that's been
with me since the beginning,

284
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,815
-what I say, I mean.
-I'm not voting
for you tonight, so...

285
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,083
And I'm not
voting for you tonight.

286
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,317
<i>ROCKSROY:</i>
<i>I think, personally,</i>

287
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,919
when it comes to guys,

288
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,890
<i>guys are more rigid</i>
<i>in making a decision,</i>

289
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,259
so I'm banking on that.

290
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,867
<i>OMAR:</i>
<i>Going into tonight,</i>

291
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,335
<i>Romeo was a dead man walking,</i>

292
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,204
<i>but in the long term,</i>

293
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,841
he's loyal to me right now,
whereas Rocksroy--

294
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,844
<i>I feel like there's less room</i>
<i>to maneuver with him.</i>

295
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,113
<i>He's immovable, he's unshakable.</i>

296
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,882
I'm trying to eliminate people
at this stage of the game that

297
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,585
<i>I can't shape or mold</i>
<i>to what I want.</i>

298
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,631
And so, they are coming
for you tonight.

299
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,700
I need to talk to Hai
to confirm the plan,

300
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,101
but I think
we should go for Rocks.

301
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,937
Hai will be the swing vote
tonight.

302
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,438
Yeah, but the problem is,
I don't trust him.

303
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,073
He wants me out.

304
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,975
I know you're feeling that way,
but you have to trust me.

305
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,977
So just be
as calm as possible.

306
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,545
<i>ROMEO:</i>
<i>The irony is,</i>

307
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:10,749
<i>the person that I wanted to</i>
<i>vote out tonight is the persn</i>

308
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:15,020
my<i> Survivor</i> life depends on
at tonight's Tribal Council.

309
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,223
<i>It's terrifying.</i>

310
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,191
I'm going to have to trust the
one person that I don't trust.

311
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,093
OMAR:
I know.

312
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,029
<i>ROMEO:</i>
<i>Let's just say</i>
<i>I'm not too confident because</i>

313
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,933
Hai is the sneakiest...

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,104
weasel that<i> Survivor 42</i> has.

315
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,074
OMAR:
I feel like you might be
on the same page

316
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,575
-with me about Rocks.
-HAI: Yes.

317
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,378
-He's getting exceedingly
difficult to work with.
-Yes.

318
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,114
If we wanted to blindside Rocks,

319
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:46,018
-I would be with you
a thousand percent.
-Tonight?

320
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,787
-Here's the concern.
-Yeah.

321
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,290
-HAI: Mike still considers me
his number one.
-Right, right.

322
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,891
If we vote Rocks tonight,

323
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,127
and I don't tell Mike,

324
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,696
-I lose his trust forever.
-Right.

325
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,198
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>Tonight's vote could be</i>
<i>very simple.</i>

326
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,100
If I wanted
to make an emotional move,

327
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,168
I would take out Romeo.

328
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,336
But for me,

329
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,071
<i>tonight's vote is not emotional.</i>

330
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,174
<i>It's strategic.</i>
<i>But I don't want</i>

331
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,843
to make this move
without Mike's blessing

332
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,112
because I don't want

I'm saying we need
a backup plan.

494
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,462
You're not listening.
You're getting really worked up,

495
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,797
and it's hard
to communicate with you

-Watching this on TV
is amazing,

but being

529
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,935
OMAR:
But, Jeff,
when you get through it,

530
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,138
you learn that there's
part of in you that can

531
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:29,007
push further than you would have
ever been pushed in real life.

532
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,610
And while it sucks now,
the lifelong lesson

533
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,178
is greater
than the sucky moment.

534
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,783
So, Mike, you go back
to the old Taku camp,

535
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,117
and you only have five people.

536
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,887
It's a new dynamic again.

537
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,188
Well, here's the deal, Jeff.

538
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,723
You-you go to sleep at night

539
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,057
and, quite frankly,
you're not comfortable here.

540
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,793
So you wake up,
and what you do is,

541
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,528
you start going through
the different evolutions

542
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,229
of this game
that you want to play.

543
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,731
And you do it over
and over and over again.

544
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,466
You put everybody there,
you think about everybody,

545
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,867
what... who they are,
what they do.

546
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,303
Then you get out there
and you go to a challenge

547
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,406
and you realize all the things
that you calculated...

548
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,775
...gets thrown out the door.

549
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:07,179
And then we only have
maybe two to three hours

550
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,613
before we're back here,
voting on somebody.

551
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,282

Hai, that was a great summation
what a, what a day can be like.

554
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,691
You wake up with plan A,
and then you get plan B.

555
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,494
Yeah, especially on this season,

556
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,130
where luck and your destiny

557
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,166
are completely
out of your control sometimes.

558
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,835
You know, we all woke up
with an idea

559
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,604
of what we wanted to do
at this Tribal,

560
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,273
but everyone had to adapt
and be flexible.

561
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,778
So, Rocksroy, how fast is
the game shifting for you?

562
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,013
Uh, I think today
we were actually

563
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,316
a little bit more mellow, Jeff,
to be quite honest.

564
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,984
-PROBST: Really?
-ROCKSROY: Uh, we were...

565
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,118
-But we were...
-With only five people?

566
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,119
ROCKSROY:
With only five people.

567
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,223
We spent a lot of time
just eating coconuts,

568
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,191
not even really
trying to strategize

569
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,492
as much as you would think.

570
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,696
PROBST:
Do you think that's a little bit
like a game of chicken?

571
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,998
ROCKSROY:
It could be, or it could be that

572
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,602
some of us have an understanding
on what's gonna happen tonight.

573
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,103
PROBST:
Mike, there it is.

574
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,340
Everybody has to believe
they have an understanding,

575
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,242
because otherwise,
now with the Shot in the Dark,

576
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,077
everybody
could screw the game up.

577
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,180
So the lying has to be so good.

578
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,648
MIKE:
Yeah, and it's tough.

579
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:17,849
We don't know,
'cause he's right.

580
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,084
We didn't scatter today.

581
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,318
We just played it safe.

582
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,920
And then-- you're right,
it may be a game of chicken.

583
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,521
I only know what I'm gonna do.

584
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,856
PROBST:
So, Romeo,

585
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:29,361
if you had to categorize
or give a flavor

586
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,162
to this afternoon,
how would you label it?

587
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,031
ROMEO:
Well, I just
found it interesting,

588
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,600
you know,
that it's an all-male tribe.

589
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,103
And, like, everyone just did
the whole male thing, and...

590
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,105
"Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. All right."

591
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,339
And then just went back
to talking about life.

592
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,507
It was very interesting.

593
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,644
Very different dynamic
with no women on this tribe.

594
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,146
PROBST:
So, Rocksroy,
when you hear Romeo say that,

595
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,049
all of you guys kind of did the
"What's up? What's up?"

596
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,385
-(laughter)
-Is that in your wheelhouse?

597
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,720
ROCKSROY:
As Romeo said, we kind
of acted like guys today.

598
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,957
We kind of, like,
dismissed that we really

599
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,226
had a big decision to make,
and we weren't gonna go off

600
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,460
and-and talk to each other.

601
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:05,630
But from what I saw today,
I didn't see anything

602
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,099
that changed my mind
to think that

603
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:12,170

tonight would be would change.

LINDSAY:
Yeah, it just threw us off guard

648
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,672
from what our plan was
for the five of us here,

649
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,041
because we kind of
all had an assumption

650

of where that five was going.

651
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,913
So I think it's
lingering a little longer.

652
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,517

So, Drea, what do you have to do

653
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,386
when you're forced to adapt
with this small of a group,

654
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,388

you may have an alliance with,

655
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,524
some of whom you may not?

656
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,093
You have to go back
to the drawing board

657
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,428
and basically see, like,
where you fit in.

658
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,031
And now, as I look and I see

659
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,034
two people over there
that I really

660
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,404
did not think would be
over there so soon,

661
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,306
it changes your mindset.

662
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,308
From what?
Conservative to aggressive?

663
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,010
From trusting to not trusting?

664
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,712
I don't know yet.

665
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,415
PROBST:
And, Tori, that could be
good news or bad news,

666
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,250
depending on which side
of the vote

667
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,219
you were on
when you walked in.

668
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,321
Right. I actually, I see this
whole twist as good news,

669
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,756
because it, like,
frees people up.

670
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,891
And now, like, you get a chance
to work with people

671
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,793
that might not have
worked with you before

672
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,328
because there was
this bigger majority.

673
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,596
It's terrifying. Don't get me
wrong, it's terrifying,

674
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,765
'cause our odds are now
one-in-four of going home.

675
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,066
Like, that is terrifying.

676
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,268
And, Jeff,
<i>Survivor</i> players who are gret

677
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,269
need to look a step ahead.

678
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,438
Just because we're
isolated in the five

679
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,307
doesn't mean that
we're always going to be

680
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,675
isolated in the five.

681
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,977
So what's the best vote
moving forward,

682
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,513
in addition to what happened
at the previous Tribal?

683
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,316
Because we have
that information now.

684
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:55,286
So, Drea, the Rocksroy vote
could influence this vote.

685
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,188
DREA:
Yeah, definitely.

686
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,123
And I was so proud because,
you know, like,

687
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,359
we have four Black contestants
in<i> Survivor.</i>

688
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,195
And then it always
happens where, at one point,

689
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,764
the Black contestants get
booted out, boom, boom, boom.

690
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:10,134
And then it's exactly
what this is right now.

691
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,569
So, yeah, I'm pissed.

692
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,439
So, do you think
it's race-related?

693
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,609
I think it's just subconsciously
a little bit of that,

694
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,143
unfortunately, but...

695
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,047
I see now I have to play
the game a little harder now.

696
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,418
I can tell you right now
I'm playing my idol tonight

697
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,953
so that I can stay in this game.

698
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,559
I'm not gonna let that happen
to another one of us--

699
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,127
point-blank.

700
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,497
It's a reset for me.
This was a game changer.

701
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,435
Wow. Tori, this Tribal is alive.

702
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,671
People are changing their minds.

703
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,673
People are declaring,
"I'm gonna play an idol."

704
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,341
The rain is starting
to pick up even more.

705
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,943
Now we got a conversation going.

706
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,646
Yeah, I mean, I support Drea
wanting to play her idol

707
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,080
if she feels like
she's making a stand.

708
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,615
I don't think it's necessary,
but...

709
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,450
That's because
she's not in my shoes.

710
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,918
-But that's okay.
-TORI: No, I know,

711
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,453
but it doesn't change my vote,
so...

712
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,455
DREA:
I'm playing it
so I can stay in the game,

713
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,890
and then I'm gonna
strategically play the game

714
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:06,891
how it should be played.

715
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,426
PROBST:
And, Tori,

716
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,229
so far, you're the only one
not in this conversation.

717
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,230
Yeah.

718
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,197
PROBST:
Is that okay?

719
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,532
TORI: I've learned
to adapt and be flexible.

720
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,468
If I'm paranoid,
emotional, crazy,

721
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,771
people aren't gonna
trust me, so...

722
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,606
I can only do what I can do.

723
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:22,840
(laughs)

724
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,444
Okay.

725
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,122
Mm-hmm.

726
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,657
MARYANNE:
I cannot write her name down,

727
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,125
-and I'm so sorry.
-It's okay, it's very emotional.

728
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,327
MARYANNE:
No, no, I literally can't.

729
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,796
'Cause it's, like,
you know what, everyone can hear

730
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,597
what I'm saying. Okay,
I'll just say it out loud.

731
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,299
It's, like, look,
Chanelle goes out.

732
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,834
Okay, that's fine,
that's one thing.

733
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,769
Rocksroy goes out,
that's another person.

734
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,405
I write Drea's name out, that's
three Black people in a row.

735
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,407
Okay? And<i> Survivor</i>

736
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,409
isn't just about s-strategy--
it's not.

737
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,078
<i>Survivor</i> is also about

738
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,513
bringing the social world,
big, into a small thing.

739
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,349
If I write Drea's name
right now,

740
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,051
that means that I'm a part of
a perpetuating problem, so...

741
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,387
It's like the same thing
over and over again

742
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,222
-in this game, and it sucks.
-Again and again and again.

743
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,357
-I can't do it.
-DREA: I'm over it.

744
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,926
So, like, we can figure
something else out,

745
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:17,061
but I, morally,
cannot write her name down.

746
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,363
-That is my line.
-I'm playing my idol,

747
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,897
-so you have to figure
something else out.
-I hear you.

748
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,367
I knew it was coming for me,
so ... that.

749
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,268
Let's play.

750
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,375
JONATHAN:
I don't feel like this is right,
because y'all

751
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,543
-are coming at this
as like we're racist.
-Well, obviously my name...

752
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,245
-No one ever said that.
-(overlapping chatter)

753
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,880
-JONATHAN: Hold on.
Let me... Hold on...
-No one ever said that.

754
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,716
But obviously it was
gonna be me today, right?

755
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,151
-Was it going to be me today?
-JONATHAN: There's nothing...

756
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,153
It doesn't mean that that's
any... has anything to do

757
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,755
-with race, guys.
This is a game.
-No one ever said that.

758
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,590
-MARYANNE: But the thing is...
-JONATHAN: Yes, y'all are.
-DREA: No.

759
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,624
Y'all just said that.

760
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,760
Don't make it seem
like I'm being aggressive.

761
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,762
You are being aggressive.

762
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,930
-Let's calm down.
This is the game, guys.
-This is what always happens...

763
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,899
-JONATHAN: It has nothing
to do with race.
-MARYANNE: Jonathan,

764
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,801
but the thing is, yes,
it is a game,

765
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,404
but there are subconscious bias
that I might have

766
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,272
that you don't know,
because it is subconscious.

767
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,907
-And that plays a part
of the game as well, too.
-No, that's-that's saying

768
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,342
that I'm subconsciously racist,
and that's not true.

769
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,711
DREA:
We never said it was you.
We're saying how we feel.

770
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,380
Just because I'm saying
how I feel, at this moment,

771
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,416
does not mean that you can
make that your problem.

772
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,851
This is my situation, my issue.

773
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,187
I'm addressing it the way
I wanted to address it,

774
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,724
and the reason I wanted to play
was for representation--

775
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,026
because people like me
weren't represented.

776
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,295
That just is a fact.
A lot of times,

777
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,064
minorities get kicked off first
in this game.

778
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,400
And I was hoping that
it wouldn't be the cycle,

779
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,136
and it is, unfortunately.

780
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,371
You are not that person.

781
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,872
I love you.
I adore you.

782
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,474
I... We get along
and stuff like that.

783
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,409
This happens all the time,

784
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,645
where we speak
and then we get shut down

785
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,314
as if, like, we're calling
everyone racist, and I'm not.

786
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,722
PROBST:
Drea, just to make sure
I heard you right,

787
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,825
you're just saying,
"Right now, I'm stepping

788
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,060
"outside of the game
to stand up for something

789
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,128
"that means something to me.

790
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,063
"And within the game,
I have the power to do it,

791
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,231
'cause I have an idol."

792
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,234
DREA:
I came into this game
knowing...

793
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,269
(cries)

794
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,676
...I would have to think
about how I speak,

795
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,278
how I act.

796
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,783
And when we say representation,

797
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,786
it's because people like us
understand each other

798
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,088
and can help others
understand us, right?

799
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,556
So, like, if we go back,

800
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,026
and this is gonna get out
that maybe

801
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,528
they made it into,
like, a racial thing.

802
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,597
And then maybe they're like,
"Oh, well, I don't want that."

803
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,032
I could be there
tomorrow anyway, so...

804
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,133
MARYANNE:
And then, now,

805
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,969
let's say that
we get to the vote,

806
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,704
and both of us are still here,

807
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,172
and no idols are played.

808
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,174
Because I have an idol, too.

809
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,010
I bring it to every Tribal.

810
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:50,548
I don't think there's any votes
which are going to me tonight,

811
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,518
but I need to play this
so that people who are watching

812
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:57,188
will know that I didn't make it
another day because of race.

813
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,657
That it wouldn't be fair
if you could hold that,

814
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,060
-believing you wouldn't get
votes because of the topic.
-DREA: You wouldn't be able to.

815
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,263
I, a thousand percent, Jeff,

816
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,465
with a thousand percent
certainty, can tell you

817
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,234
that if both of us don't
play our idols tonight,

818
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,237
there will be someone watching
and saying they used race.

819
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,273
-Nothing is...
off-limits in<i> Survivor...</i>
-Off-limits.

820
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,142
And that's what I'm thinking.
Like, it just sucks.

821
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,777
Like, now it's gonna
become this.

822
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,179
-And it's like...
-LINDSAY: I never
took it that way.

823
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,248
I respect what
both of you are saying.

824
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,616
I respect
this whole conversation.

825
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,319
Like, I've never sat
in their shoes that way,

826
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:32,189
but I can empathize with them
for having to deal with that

827
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,191
day in and day out with things.

828
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,927
Like, it hurts me that they're
both getting so emotional

829
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,129
and that that vote

830
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:41,098
brought something
outside of the game into this.

831
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,767
And, Drea, I don't feel like
you were being aggressive.

832
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,436
I think it was absolutely fair
for you to say that.

833
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:49,507
And it's just, I'm sorry
that they're hurting for that.

834
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,210
MARYANNE:
Like, Jeff, coming to this game,
my biggest fear

835
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,614
wasn't going and, like, using
an advantage or idol correctly.

836
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,617
My biggest fear was that I would
see some sort of injustice

837
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,652
and I would sit down
and do nothing.

838
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,554
And, like, I'm not saying
that it's an injustice

839
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,289
for Chanelle and Rocksroy
to be voted out,

840
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,958
because, like,
I don't know the full story.

841
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,226
But if I let
that pattern continue,

842
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,964
that's an injustice for me and
my experience as a Black woman.

843
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,399
And especially coming on, like,
<i>Survivor,</i> where it's, like,

844
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,001
you know millions of people
will be watching,

845
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:21,238
it feels like I have to do it,
because who else will?

846
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,574
It's, like, so frustrating
how I have to then

847
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,110
incorporate that to
the way that I play the game.

848
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:29,280
Even talking to Omar previously,

849
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,250
there's never been a Muslim
person who has made the merge.

850
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,518
And that changes his gameplay--
maybe for the better,

851
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,121
maybe for the worse--
but that changes it.

852
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,257
And some people don't have
to experience that burden

853
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,759
when they go
and they enter the game.

854
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:46,163
Yes, we all technically have a
one-in-18 shot for the million,

855
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,032
but because we all come
with our burdens,

856
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,500
and we all come
with our privileges,

857
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:53,170
that one-in-18 might be bigger
or smaller for some people.

858
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,605
And that sucks.

859
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,708
-Wow. That was amazing.
-DREA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

860
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,713
PROBST:
Jonathan,
how are you feeling now?

861
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,749
JONATHAN:
Um...

862
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,117
(sniffles)

863
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:09,420
I'm glad that it's cleared up
that it's not the tribe

864
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,589
that has
made them feel this way.

865
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,892
If I could, I would love
to let 'em know that I love 'em.

866
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,894
This isn't about me
hating you or anything.

867
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,562
This isn't about me
hating any of you.

868
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,798
-'Cause you know
that I love all of you guys.
-I know that. I know that.

869
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,300
This is a moment
bigger than the game.

870
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,635
Yeah.

871
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,138
And seeing their emotion
is, like, hard for me

872
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,072
to just look past that
and be like,

873
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,273
"Okay, let's get back
to game mode."

874
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,242
I feel like that would minimize
their experience

875
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,277
that they're feeling to be like,
"Oh, hey, by the way,

876
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,178
can we talk?" I don't know.

877
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,646
That's why it just feels wrong.

878
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,682
Yeah, I hear you on that, too.

879
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,749
Yeah.

880
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,585
Is part of what
makes it hard to transition

881
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,854
is that we're now gonna
go through the formality

882
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,289
of walking up these stairs

883
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,793
and in private writing a name
down? Is that part of it?

884
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,295
-Yes.
-Because the other option is,

885
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,798
we can skip
that pomp and circumstance

886
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,800
and keep it here,

887
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,101
meaning it would be
talking about it.

888
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,536
So, would
they turn in their idols

889
00:38:58,602 --> 00:38:59,704
and then we go from there?

890
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,273
Well, I mean,
that's their call, what they do.

891
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,046
Wow.

892
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,081
Good job, guys.

893
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,549
-Good job, y'all.
-MARYANNE: Thank you.

894
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,918
PROBST:
I can settle this quickly.

895
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,287
These are both
hidden immunity idols.

896
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,289
Drea's not going home.

897
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:20,257
Maryanne is not going home.

898
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,326
So, Lindsay,
what does that mean?

899
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,128
Because Jonathan is also safe.

900
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,663
Sounds like it's me or Tori.

901
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,965
And all I can hope for is that

902
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,801
they want to trust me and
want to go forward with me

903
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,103
and feel like
I'm gonna be a good player

904
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,704
to be alongside them.

905
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,242
Tori, that was
a long look back to me.

906
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,144
Well, I can feel
maybe you guys are

907
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,246
leaning more towards Lindsay.
Is that the vibe I'm getting?

908
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,949
-Yeah, I'm gonna vote for you.
Yeah.
-Is that the vibe I'm getting?

909
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,650
Well, actually
I'd like to know why.

910
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,285
Why would you like
to get rid of me?

911
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,488
'Cause you've been
gunning for me since Ika.

912
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,523
Not true, but okay.

913
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,691
You've lied to me.

914
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:54,759
Okay, yes.

915
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,094
I don't have as good of
a relationship with you.

916
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,796
Uh-huh. Than with her?

917
00:39:58,863 --> 00:39:59,797
Right.

918
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,432
TORI:
Okay. What are your thoughts?

919
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,101
The game is still on, and
I don't want to vote you out,

920
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,138
but part of the game's that
I have to vote someone out,

921
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,440
and in this moment right now,
this is the best step for me.

922
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,508
Which sucks.

923
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,043
Well, I want to do this,
and I'm gonna go

924
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,278
play my Shot in the Dark.

925
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,113
And we can go from there.

926
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:20,217
Okay, so you formally
are telling me

927
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,952
that your votes
will be for Tori?

928
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,387
-JONATHAN: Right.
-LINDSAY: Yeah.

929
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,156
PROBST:
Okay. And, Tori, you're saying

930
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,190
you're gonna go play
your Shot in the Dark?

931
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,025

at this point. (scoffs)
