00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,545
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:03,837
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,255
AFTER THE MERGE, MALCOLM,

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,339
REYNOLD, AND EDDIE FOUND

5
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,091
THEMSELVES ON THE OUTSIDE OF

00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,885
STEALTH "R" US,AN UNBREAKABLE

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,595
ALLIANCE OF SEVEN LED BY

8
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:12,804
PHILLIP.

9
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,139
BUT THEY WERE GAINING CONFIDENCE

10
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,056
AND WERE READY TO MAKE A BIG

11
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,309
MOVE.

12
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,769
>> I STILL HAVE AN IDOL.

13
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,105
I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT SOME

14
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:22,355
FIREWORKS.

15
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,857
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, THE LEADER

16
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,024
OF STEALTH "R" US, WAS ALSO

17
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:25,275
CONFIDENT.

18
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,568
>> I FEEL LIKE I JUST MIGHT HAVE

19
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,528
A SHOT OF WINNING.

20
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,070
>> Jeff: HE HAD A STRONG

21
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,989
ALLIANCE AND BELIEVED NOTHING

22
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:31,823
COULD GET IN THEIR WAY.

23
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,867
>> ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF BEING

24
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,452
THE NUMBERS 7-3 IS THAT IT

25
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,035
DOESN'T MATTER.

26
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,537
ONE OF THOSE THREE ARE GOING TO

27
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:37,787
GO HOME.

28
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,164
>> STEALTH!

29
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,791
>> Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

30
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,459
CHALLENGE, REYNOLD FOUND THE

31
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,918
STRENGTH TO WIN.

32
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,503
REYNOLD WINS IMMUNITY!

33
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,254
>> Jeff: AND BACK AT CAMP

34
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,882
MALCOLM FOUND ANOTHER HIDDEN

35
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:49,215
IMMUNITY IDOL.

36
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,550
>> MALCOLM JUST FOUND THE IDOL.

37
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,217
>> WHO CARES?

38
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,596
WE GOT THE NUMBERS, BABE.

39
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,221
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

40
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,515
STEALTH "R" US THOUGHT THEY HAD

41
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:57,849
AN EASY VOTE.

42
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,517
>> EVERYONE'S LOOKING AT EDDIE

43
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,227
BECAUSE MALCOLM HAPPENED UPON

44
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,146
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

45
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,689
>> Jeff: BUT IT QUICKLY TURNED

46
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,315
INTO ONE OF THE CRAZIEST TRIBAL

47
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,232
COUNCIL IT IS GAME HAS EVER

48
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,275
SEEN.

49
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,234
>> THIS IS THE OTHER IMMUNITY

50
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,529
IDOL I'VE BEEN HANGING ON TO.

51
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,655
I'M GIVING IT TO EDDIE.

52
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,200
I HAD THAT ONE FOR A WHILE.

53
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,701
I JUST FOUND THE OTHER ONE

54
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:16,910
TODAY.

55
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,827
ONE OF THE SEVEN OF THIS VERY

56
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,996
TIGHT GROUP ARE GOING HOME.

57
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,414
>> Jeff: WITH THE THREE AMIGOS

58
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,332
NOW IN CONTROL, THEY TRIED TO

59
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,250
CONVINCE PHILIP'S ALLIANCE TO

60
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:24,918
TURN ON HIM.

61
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,419
>> WE'LL JUST THROW IT OUT

62
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:26,628
THERE.

63
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,129
THE THREE OF US ARE VOTING FOR

64
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:28,338
PHILLIP.

65
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,799
PHILLIP IS THE FUN SPONGE, HE

66
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,550
SUCKS IT OUT OF THE GROUP.

67
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,176
>> Jeff: IN THE END, THE ONLY

68
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,553
MEMBER OF THE STEALTH "R" US

69
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,304
ALLIANCE TO CHANGE THEIR VOTE

70
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,973
WAS ERIC, BUT IT WAS ENOUGH.

71
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,642
PHILLIP, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

72
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:40,975
>> THANK YOU.

73
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,560
>> Jeff: LEAVING STEALTH "R"

74
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,728
US WITHOUT ITS LEADER.

75
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,562
NINE ARE LEFT.

76
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:59,577
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

77
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,578
>> THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

78
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,372
>> IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY

79
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,623
HI AND TALK TO YOU GUYS.

80
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,290
>> WOW, YEAH.

81
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,501
>> GOING INTO IT I WAS LIKE THIS

82
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,335
MIGHT NOT WORK OUT.

83
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,670
>> YOU GUYS THOUGHT WE WERE

84
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,295
TRYING TO PULL ONE OVER ON YOU.

85
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,298
WE WERE JUST LIKE IT IS WORTH

86
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:12,799
THREE IMMUNITIES TO US.

87
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,218
>> I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE

88
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:15,426
GENUINE.

89
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,345
>> WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE

90
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,179
SPECIALIST PHILLIP SHEPHERD, I

91
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,390
THINK STEALTH "R" US HOPEFULLY

92
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,599
IS GOING TO FRACTURE.

93
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,560
>> NOW I NEVER HAVE TO USE THE

94
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,227
PHRASE STEALTH "R" US EVER

95
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:24,435
AGAIN.

96
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,063
>> THANK GOODNESS!

97
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:27,313
(LAUGHTER)

98
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,982
>> IF THOSE SIX PEOPLE STICK

99
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,567
TOGETHER, I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE

100
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:30,900
IN THIS GAME.

101
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,902
IF I KNOCK OFF THEIR LEADER,

102
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,528
MAYBE ONE TWO WILL FRACTURE AND

103
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,321
COME TO THE DARK SIDE WITH ME

104
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,531
AND THE THREE AMIGOS.

105
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,658
>> THERE'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING I

106
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,242
DISLIKE ABOUT PHILLIP IN THIS

107
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,201
GAME EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT HE

108
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,203
CAN'T FIT HIS HEAD AND EGO

109
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,789
UNDERNEATH THE SHELTER.

110
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,748
THE STABILITY HAS BEEN ROCKED

111
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,210
OUT OF THE GAME.

112
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,587
LIKE, THE LEGS HAVE BEEN KICKED

113
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,212
OUT UNDER THE CHAIR OF STEALTH

114
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,215
"R" US AND IT OPENS ME UP TO

115
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,885
TALKING WITH PEOPLE THAT PHILLIP

116
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:57,927
DIDN'T WANT KNOW TALK TO.

117
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,804
>> HE WAS HIS OWN DOWNFALL.

118
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,430
>> I KNOW.

119
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,515
>> THE TRICK KEY PART NOW IS

120
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,933
DECIDING WHEN TO VOTE WITH THE

121
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,810
THREE BOYS AND WHEN TO VOTE WITH

122
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,145
THE REMAINING FAVORITES.

123
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,563
AND I ENJOY THAT POSITION

124
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,148
BECAUSE I CAN CHOOSE AT THE LAST

125
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,649
MINUTE WHICH OPTION IS BETTER

126
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:30,084
FOR ERIC.

127
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,131
>> I FEEL BEAT.

128
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,175
>> I FEEL WHOOPED.

129
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,509
I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS TIRED

130
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,428
BEFORE.

131
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:40,637
DAY 29.

132
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,471
>> I'VE PARTICIPATED IN AND

133
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,640
CERTAINLY VIEWED HUNDREDS OF

134
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,307
TRIBAL COUNCILS.

135
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,350
NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN

136
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,101
ANYTHING QUITE LIKE WHAT

137
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,353
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL

138
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:48,603
COUNCIL.

139
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,730
IT LEFT ME BREATHLESS, IT LEFT

140
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,192
ME TERRIFIED.

141
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,485
TODAY'S BEEN A PRETTY ROUGH DAY

142
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,027
AROUND CAMP.

143
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,946
PEOPLE ARE REALLY HUNGRY AND

144
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:58,571
SPIRITS HAVE BEEN LOW AND IT WAS

145
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,408
DRIVING EVERYBODY CRAZY.

146
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,284
THERE AREN'T TOO MANY DAYS OF

147
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:07,455
THIS LEFT, OR DAYS LIKE THIS.

148
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:12,543
>> YOU OKAY?

149
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:17,257
YOU WANT SOME WATER?

150
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,343
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

151
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,053
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

152
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,305
THE BRANDON DAYS, THE SWAPS, THE

153
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,350
MERGE, THE VOTING PEOPLE OUT.

154
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,309
>> HUGE SURPRISES LIKE LAST

155
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,561
NIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

156
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,313
STUFF LIKE THAT SCARES ME

157
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,649
BECAUSE FOR THE THREE GUYS TO

158
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,442
STAY AND THEN FOR US SEVEN TO

159
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,152
LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND BE LIKE

160
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,738
ONE OF US IS GOING HOME IT -- IT

161
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,032
THREW A BIG THING IN MY PLAN.

162
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,326
SO LOSING CONTROL OF THE GAME,

163
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,327
IT'S TERRIFYING.

164
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,621
IT'S JUST WHEN YOUR BODY IS LIKE

165
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:48,746
--

166
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,872
>> I KNOW.

167
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,624
YOU'VE LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT,

168
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:51,791
TOO.

169
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,583
KEEP DRINKING.

170
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,004
WE'VE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY

171
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:56,254
DRINKING.

172
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,380
>> REALLY, HOW CAN WE LIVE OFF

173
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:57,630
OF WATER.

174
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,965
>> YOU CAN.

175
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,427
>> IT'S SO DEPRESSING, YOU KNOW?

176
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,386
IT'S JUST A LITTLE HARD WITH THE

177
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,388
EMOTIONS, THE FOOD SITUATION,

178
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,347
THE LOW ENERGY AND WITH THAT

179
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,432
UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT THESE BOYS

180
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:11,519
ARE CAPABLE OF.

181
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:39,422
>> GUYS, WE GOT SOME TREEMAIL.

182
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,299
>> I KNEW IT!

183
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:41,591
I KNEW IT!

184
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,718
>> YAY!

185
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:43,926
COME ON!

186
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,430
>> WHAT DO WE HAVE?

187
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,139
(ULULATING)

188
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,932
>> 500 BUCKS IN CASH!

189
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,143
>> OH, MY GOD!

190

>> IT'S ALL GOOD, HUH?

564
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:44,586
GOOD.

565
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,630
>> THIS IS WHY I'M OUT HERE.

566
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,798
FOR THESE PEOPLE.

567
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,050
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR THEM.

568
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,553
>> YOU OKAY OVER THERE, COCHRAN.

569
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,805
>> YEAH, I'M GOOD.

570
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:55,347
>> YOU'RE JUST EMOTIONAL.

571
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,975
>> YEAH, WHICH IS SURPRISING FOR

572
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:58,142
ME.

573
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,102
>> I KNOW, I REMEMBER LAST TIME.

574
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,689
>> I'VE BEEN TRYING HARD TO PLAY

575
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,316
THIS EMOTIONLESS GAME THIS TIME,

576
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,110
JUST BE A GAME BOT WHO RUNS

577
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,903
THROUGH STRATEGY.

578
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,071
AND GETTING LETTERS FROM HOME

579
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,656
MAKES YOU REALIZE THERE IS LIFE

580
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,367
OUTSIDE THE GAME AND THING I

581
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,827
HAVE MORE THAN THIS GAME.

582
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,328
AND PART OF ME IS A LITTLE BIT

583
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,621
HAPPY THAT I'M STILL THE PERSON

584
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,206
WHO VALUES FAMILY AND LOVE AND I

585
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,207
GUESS THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY

586
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:22,458
IMPORTANT.

587
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,753
I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT, THOUGH.

588
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,129
>> JeffWHY?

589
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:27,963
>> I DON'T KNOW.

590
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,214
>> OH, MY GOSH, STOP.

591
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,924
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

592
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,509
28 DAYS WITHOUT HEARING FROM

593
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,093
YOUR FAMILY.

594
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,471
>> IT'S GOOD, MAN, IT MEANS

595
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:35,804
YOU'RE HUMAN.

596
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,890
>> YOU'RE HANGING TOUGH THERE,

597
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,098
GIRL.

598
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:38,640
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYTHING

599
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,685
DECENT TO EAT OF SUBSTANCE IN --

600
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,269
>> 29 DAYS.

601
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,521
>> THAT'S INSANE.

602
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,356
KEEP HANGING TOUGH, AND STICK

603
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,191
WITH US.

604
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,526
>> YOU BETTER PUT SOMETHING OUT

605
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,110
YOUR BUTT, GOOD.

606
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,197
>> IF WE HAVE ERIK AND WE HAD

607
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,785
YOU, THAT'S A MAJORITY.

608
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:02,539
>> IT'S GUARANTEE TO THE FINAL

609
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:02,748
FIVE.

610
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,000
>> MALCOLM HAS THE CLUE FOR THE

611
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,043
HIDDEN IMMUNITY AND EVERYBODY'S

612
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,211
PARANOID BECAUSE IF THEY'RE

613
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,170
CONSTANTLY WINNING AND HAVE

614
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,422
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS YOU START

615
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,882
FEELING THEY'RE UNBEATABLE.

616
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,926
SO IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM, JOIN

617
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:14,134
THEM.

618
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,719
>> WE'RE GOING TO WIN PERSONAL

619
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,762
IMMUNITIES AND HAVE THE IDOLS.

620
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,388
>> I KNOW.

621
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:18,680
I KNOW THIS.

622
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,183
>> SO WE COULD GUARANTEE YOU

623
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,602
WORST CASE FIFTH AND WE WANT

624
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:23,769
YOU.

625
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,771
>> FIRST ROUND DRAFT PICK.

626
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,188
>> WE NEED TO TALK.

627
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,273
>> NOT RIGHT NOW, THOUGH.

628
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:28,524
>> UH-HUH.

629
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,235
>> THEY STILL HAVE US

630
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,778
OUTNUMBERED 6-3.

631
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,531
BUT IF WE HAVE ERIK AND SHERRI,

632
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,198
WE ARE THE MAJORITY.

633
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,117
>> THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET

634
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:39,326
THEM?

635
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,410
>> YEAH, LET ME DEAL WITH IT.

636
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,371
YOU DEAL WITH ERIK, I'LL DEAL

637
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,038
WITH SHERRI.

638
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:44,706
>> WE NEED TO KNOCK OUT COCHRAN.

639
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,458
IF WE KNOCK OUT STRATEGIC POWER

640
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,126
PLAYERS THAT ALLIANCE IS

641
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:58,011
COMPLETELY BUSTED.

642
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,984
>> I'M STILL TRYING TO STICK

643
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,234
AROUND.

644
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:12,776
MAKING IT JUST A COUPLE MORE

645
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,779
DAYS IN THIS GAME CAN CHANGE THE

646
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,196
GAME.

647
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,782
THE IDOL CLUE SAID IF YOU WALK

648
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,701
TOWARD THE WATER-- WHICH I'M

649
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,827
ASSUMING MEANS THE WELL-- YOU

650
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,245
HAVE TO LOOK TO YOUR LEFT AND

651
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,246
THERE'S GOING TO BE A TREE

652
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,581
GROWING OUT OF THE ROCKS AND

653
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,832
SOMEWHERE AROUND THE BASE SIX

654
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,042
INCHES DEEP IS A BURIED HIDDEN

655
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:29,376
IMMUNITY IDOL.

656
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,961
SO I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF

657
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,046
DIGGING TO DO AND HOPEFULLY I'LL

658
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,840
HAVE MY THIRD IDOL IN THIS GAME.

659
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,424
AT THIS POINT ANY POWER THAT I

660
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,718
CAN GET IN MY CORNER IS GOING TO

661
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:43,056
BE NECESSARY TO ENSURING I STICK

662
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,265
AROUND.

663
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:43,515
MORNING.

664
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,434
>> OH, HEY.

665
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,436
I LOVE THE SMELL OF FRESH DIRT.

666
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,105
>> YEAH, ME, TOO.

667
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,523
>> WENT OVER AND STARTED DIGGING

668
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,484
FOR THE IDOL AND GOT BUSTED BY

669
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:54,902
ANDREA.

670
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,112
SHE SAW ME CHECKING OUT A FEW

671
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,822
OTHER CONSPICUOUS ROCKS AND

672
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,490
LARGE TREES.

673
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:06,496
IT'S A WEIRD SITUATION.

674
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,999
>> I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

675
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,291
I'M SORRY.

676
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,085
>> THAT'S OKAY.

677
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,588
I'M JUST GOING TO RELAX.

678
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:21,303
>> I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

679
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,972
>> THIS MORNING I WOKE UP AND

680
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:24,598
MALCOLM IS ALREADY STIRRING AND

681
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,433
IT'S STILL DARK AND I FOLLOWED

682
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,309
THEM TO THE WELL AND I FIND HIM

683
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,395
DIGGING AT THIS TREE AND THEN I

684
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,064
DECIDED TO JUST SIT HERE BECAUSE

685
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,398
I KNOW THAT IF F THERE'S AN IDOL

686
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,609
IT'S PROBABLY ME GOING HOME

687
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,319
BECAUSE MY NAME HAS COME ALREADY

688
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,613
AND SO IT WAS A SHOWDOWN.

689
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,698
IS THIS A STANDOFF?

690
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,285
>> YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SIT

691
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:45,494
HERE?

692
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,329
>> I'M JUST GOING TO COME BACK

693
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:47,496
LATER.

694
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,413
ARE YOU GOING TO FOLLOW ME

695
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,415
AROUND ALL DAY?

696
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,376
ARE YOU NOT LEAVING?

697
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,377
>> I WAS GOING TO STAY HERE.

698
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,837
I MEAN, YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU NEED

699
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,423
TO DO, LIKE, I'M NOT GOING TO

700
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:07,224
DISTURB ANYTHING.

701
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,981
>> IF I LEAVE, ARE YOU LEAVING

702
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:14,189
WITH ME?

703
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,774
>> I'LL GO BACK WITH YOU.

704
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,358
>> RIGHT NOW?

705
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,360
>> WELL I CAN'T -- YEAH.

706
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,736
YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE SISTER I

707
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,154
CAN'T GET RID OF.

708
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,448
>> (LAUGHS)

709
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:28,370
>> OKAY, LET'S GO.

710
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:28,912
SAME TIME TOMORROW MORNING.

711
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,957
>> YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU HERE.

712
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,207
HOPEFULLY.

713
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,583
ANDREA, SHE'S A SMART GIRL,

714
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,918
SHE'S NOT GOING TO GIVE ME A

715
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:35,627
SECOND TO DIG.

716
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,338
I FEEL LIKE A BIT OF AN IDIOT.

717
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,589
$480 DOWN THE DRAIN.

718
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,424
A MILLION DOLLARS DOWN THE

719
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,634
DRAIN, MAYBE.

720
00:21:50,434 --> 00:22:00,444
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

721
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,528
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

722
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:01,945

>> YES.

724
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,282
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.

725
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,533
REYNOLD, GOT TO TAKE IT BACK.

726
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,077
>> ALL RIGHT.

727
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,372
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

728
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,292
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

729
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:15,584
FOR GRABS.

730
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,753
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

731
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,755
GOING TO HOLD ON TO A ROPE THAT

732
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,466
IS CONNECTED TO A VERY HEAVY

733
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,632
LOG.

734
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,136
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU WILL

735
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,013
MOVE ONE KNOT LOWER ON THE ROPE,

736
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,098
MAKING THE WEIGHT MORE DIFFICULT

737
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:30,557
TO BEAR.

738
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,976
WHEN YOU DROP YOUR ROPE, YOU'RE

739
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,062
OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

740
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,355

TONIGHT.

747

EVERYBODY ELSE IS HOLDING A LOT

792
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,265
MORE WEIGHT THAN HE IS.

793
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,642
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP DROPPING

794
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,105
DOWN EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

795
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,273

THIS IS THE LAST KNOT YOU HAVE

804
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,006
TO HOLD ON TO.

805
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:08,673
AFTER THIS ROUND IT WILL JUST BE

806
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,718
A LITTLE PIECE OF ROPE.

807
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:22,938
NOW IT'S GETTING VERY HEAVY.

YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO HOME

818
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,419
TONIGHT.

819
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,504
DAWN'S STRUGGLING TO STAY IN IT.

820
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,631
KEEP DIGGING, DAWN.

821
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:55,387

THERE WILL BE NO KNOT UNDERNEATH

829
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,068

830
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,737
NOW IT'S JUST ROPE-- EXCEPT FOR

831

SHERRI CAN'T DO IT.

835
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,039

WE ARE NOW DOWN TO FIVE.

00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,833
PAID $480 FOR A CLUE TO AND I

936
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,293
CAN'T GO LOOK FOR IT BECAUSE

937
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,003
I'LL JUST BE HOUNDED BY THE

938
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:57,212
GIRLS.

939
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:57,879
THEY'LL START DIGGING AROUND ME

940
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,047
LITERALLY.

941
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,381
I'VE JUST GOT TO BLUFF MY WAY

942
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,049
THROUGH THIS BASICALLY.

943
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,092
>> WE NEED THEM TO THINK WE'RE

944
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:03,468
PLAYING AN IDOL.

945
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:03,968
>> DID YOU GET IT.

946
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,137
>> NO.

947
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,014
>> WE CAN'T LET THEM VOTE SIX.

948
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,474
THEY HAVE TO BE CONVINCED WE'RE

949
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,892
GOING TO PLAY THE IDOL TODAY.

950
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,393
>> IF THE FAVORITES GO A SPLIT

951
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,521
VOTE, THAT'S THE BEST-CASE

952
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,271
SCENARIO BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE'VE

953
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:15,939
GOT SHERRI AND IF I HAVE SHERRI

954
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,024
AND THEY SPLIT THE VOTE NO

955
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,943
MATTER HOW THEY PLAY IT, 3-3,

956
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:24,030
WE'RE GOOD WITH FOUR VOTES.

957
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,536
I TRUST YOU AND I LIKE YOU SO

958
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,078
THEY HAVE TO SPLIT THE VOTE

959
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,913
BECAUSE I GOT THE IDOL.

960
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,625
>> YOU HAVE ONE IDOL?

961
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,251
>> SO NO MATTER WHAT THEY HAVE

962
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,836
TO SPLIT THE VOTE OR ELSE I CAN

963
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,837
PLAY THAT THING.

964
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,922
ARE WE GOING TO MAKE A DEAL OR

965
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,801
NOT, SORRY?

966
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,385
I'LL GO TO THE END WITH YOU

967
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,511
RIGHT NOW.

968
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:46,970
I'M TELLING YOU.

969
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,012
>> BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

970
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,097
GET RID OF ONE OF THEM.

971
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,682
>> I KNOW.

972
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,849
>> I THINK I WANT TO PLAY WITH

973
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,475
THE MUSCLE HEADS BECAUSE I THINK

974
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,101
THE MUSCLE HEADS ARE GOING TO

975
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,102
KEEP WINNING THE CHALLENGES.

976
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,772
BUT THEN I FLIP AND I GO, BUT

977
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:58,481
COCHRAN WON ONE TODAY.

978
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:02,735
BUT COCHRAN WON ONE BECAUSE HE

979
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,528
HAS AN ADVANTAGE.

980
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:03,778
>> ERIK?

981
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,613
>> HE'S OVER THERE TALKING.

982
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,741
>> NO BUT HE'S GOING TO BE FIVE.

983
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,160
>> IF YOU'RE WITH US THAT'S GOOD

984
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,036
AS LONG AS THEY KNOW I HAVE AN

985
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,245
IDOL.

986
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,789
>> WHO ARE WE GOING TO GO FOR?

987
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,040
I NEED TO KNOW THE NAME.

988
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,166
>> ANDREA.

989
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,127
>> SWEAR TO ME.

990
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:27,051
>> PINKIE?

991
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,597
>> IF WE'RE FOUR WITH YOU, WE'RE

992
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:30,930
ON OUR WAY.

993
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,057
>> YOU CAN TAKE DOWN ANYBODY YOU

994
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:33,266
WANT.

995
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,268
>> I MEAN, I DON'T CARE WHO IT

996
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,477
IS AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ONE OF

997
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,103
THE FOUR OF US.

998
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,314
>> IF THEY'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE

999
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,441
VOTE 3-3, ASSUMING 3-3, ME BEING

1000
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,817
ONE OF THE THREE IN THAT.

1001
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,109
>> RIGHT.

1002
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,027
>> I'LL VOTE WITH YOU GUYS.

1003
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,361
>> OKAY.

1004
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,446
>> AND IT WILL BE FOUR.

1005
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:46,988
>> COOL.

1006
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,406
>> THERE ARE TWO ALLIANCES WHICH

1007
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,325
ARE THE THREE BOYS OF MALCOLM,

1008
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,618
EDDIE AND REYNOLD AND THEN THE

1009
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,244
FIVE FAVORITES AND SHERRI ON THE

1010
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:53,745
OTHER SIDE.

1011
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,163
I NEED TO KNOW AS MUCH

1012
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,414
INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE.

1013
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,458
SO I HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING BOTH

1014
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,584
SIDES WHICH I'M EXCITED ABOUT

1015
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,711
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M

1016
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:02,003
TERRIFIED.

1017
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:02,337
>> I TRUST YOU.

1018
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,005
IT'S JUST A BIG VOTE.

1019
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,548
>> I KNOW IT'S A BIG VOTE.

1020
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,716
>> BECAUSE IF SOMEONE SWINGS.

1021
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,134
>> BUT WE'VE NOT GOING TO FLIP

1022
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,177
BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S SOLID.

1023
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,928
>> I PUT ALL MY TRUST IN YOU.

1024
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,013
>> I KNOW.

1025
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:12,513
WE ALL ARE.

1026
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,514
>> I KNOW.

1027
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:13,848
I KNOW.

1028
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,225
>> IF I DIDN'T HAVE DIARRHEA I

1029
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,769
WOULDN'T BE SO NERVOUS.

1030
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,437
IT'S JUST THAT I'M PUTTING MY

1031
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,064
WHOLE GAME IN WITH YOU.

1032
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,148
>> DAWN, I KNOW!

1033
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,691
THIS IS THE BIGGEST DECISION FOR

1034
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,233
ME TODAY.

1035
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,026
THERE'S A FORK IN THE ROAD, YOU

1036
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,070
CAN'T GO BACK AFTER THIS.

1037
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,072
I HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING LIKE I'M

1038
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,031
GOING BOTH WAYS AT THE SAME TIME

1039
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,158
ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THE VOTE.

1040
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,034
ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL I KNOW THE

1041
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,203
NAME I'M ABOUT TO WRITE DOWN AND

1042
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,204
IT MIGHT EVEN CHANGE AT TRIBAL

1043
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:36,412
COUNCIL.

1044
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,207
>> WHAT'S THE VOTE TONIGHT?

1045
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,376
GUYS AND YOU VOTE FOR MALCOLM.

1046
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,045
>> GIRLS VOTE REYNOLD.

1047
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,380
NO IDOLS PLAYED.

1048
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:45,797
MALCOLM GOES HOME.

1049
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,757
>> I'D LOVE FOR MALCOLM TO GO

1050
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:47,965
HOME.

1051
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,592
>> YOU GUYS ARE ALL REALLY

1052
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,176
COMFORTABLE WITH SPLITTING?

1053
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,971
>> PART OF ME THINKS THAT WHY

1054
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,390
WOULDN'T YOU JUST DO A STRAIGHT

1055
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,516
VOTE ON SOMEBODY?

1056
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,017
>> WHY WOULD WE?

1057
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:58,893
MALCOLM HAS THE --

1058
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,104
>> YEAH, BUT THEY'LL STILL PLAY

1059
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,772
IT IF WE'RE DOING A STRAIGHT

1060
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:02,980
VOTE.

1061
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:03,398
>> THAT'S MY POINT.

1062
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,441
>> IT'S SAFE IF IT'S SPLIT.

1063
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,234
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1064
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,778
>> WELL, IT'S DISASTROUS IF IT'S

1065
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,404
SPLIT AND SOMETHING GOES WRONG

1066
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,655
WITH THE SPLIT.

1067
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:10,905
>> RIGHT.

1068
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,031
>> THE ONLY SUSPICIOUS IS THAT

1069
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,534
MAYBE ERIK CASTING THE PHILLIP

1070
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:14,742
VOTE.

1071
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,285
BUT WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT OF

1072
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:16,577
DOING THAT.

1073
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,537
>> YEAH.

1074
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,580
>> IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED MY

1075
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,040
ALLIANCE IS GOING TO VOTE WITH

1076
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:21,207
ME.

1077
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,126
BUT ALL IT TAKES IS ONE PERSON

1078
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,293
TO FLIP.

1079
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:24,585
IT'S HARD!

1080
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,212
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, PUTTING YOUR

1081
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,089
FAITH INTO THESE PEOPLE THAT,

1082
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,716
YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS I THINK

1083
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,466
THAT ERIK'S TELLING THE TRUTH I

1084
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,510
DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS A DIFFERENT

1085
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:32,760
AGENDA.

1086
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,761
LIKE, IF HE WANTS TO COME TO

1087
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,179
THIS GAME AND SAY "I GOT FOOLED

1088
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,848
BY A GIRL THE FIRST TIME, WHY

1089
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,225
DON'T I JUST FLIP WITH THE

1090
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:39,434
GUYS?"

1091
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,768
I THINK ERIK'S WITH US.

1092
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,310
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK ERIK'S

1093
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,897
DUMB ENOUGH TO SWITCH OVER RIGHT

1094
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:45,064
NOW.

1095
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,691
YOU KNOW, HOW DUMB WOULD YOU BE

1096
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,235
TO DO THAT?

1097
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,405
>> SIX FAVORITES, THREE AMIGOS.

1098
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,031
NEITHER SIDE REALIZES THIS IS MY

1099
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,450
GAME RIGHT NOW.

1100
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,201
I'M THE ONE CALLING THE SHOTS.

1101
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,745
THEY DON'T GET IT.

1102
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,913
>> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU FOR A

1103
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,122
SECOND.

1104
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:01,456
>> OKAY.

1105
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,459
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

1106
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,377
I KIND OF WANT HIM TO THINK I

1107
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,837
DON'T REALIZE I HAVE THIS MUCH

1108
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,045
POWER.

1109
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,714
AS OF THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW I'M

1110
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:26,272
TORN OF WHO I'M GOING WITH.

1111
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,234
>> I'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS

1112
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,319
OF OUR JURY.

1113
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,904
MICHAEL AND PHILLIP VOTED OUT AT

1114
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:41,162
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1115
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,205
LOTS TO TALK ABOUT, REYNOLD, DID

1116
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,164
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL AND

1117
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,332
EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON SHAKE

1118
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,500
ANYTHING UP?

1119
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,710
>> I THINK PHILLIP'S DEPARTURE

1120
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,295
MARKED A NEW CHAPTER IN THE GAME

1121
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,965
AND I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE 6-3

1122
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:53,925
ANYMORE BECAUSE IN THIS GAME IF

1123
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,176
YOU DON'T MAKE MOVES YOU MIGHT

1124
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,803
BE DOOMED TO BE GOING HOME

1125
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,262
SOONER THAN YOU THOUGHT.

1126
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,263
>> Jeff: ANDREA, A LITTLE

1127
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,307
UNNERVING WHEN YOU HEAR ONE OF

1128
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,267
THE THREE GUYS WHO'VE BEEN ON

1129
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,603
THE OUTS SAY "NOT SO SURE IT'S

1130
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:05,937
6-3 ANYMORE."

1131
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,605
>> THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAKES

1132
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:07,897
ME NERVOUS.

1133
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,398
BUT ANYBODY FLIPPING AT THIS

1134
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,858
POINT WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH

1135
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,609
DOOMING THEIR GAME.

1136
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,444
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT EDDIE,

1137
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,195
MALCOLM, AND REYNOLD WHO ARE

1138
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,114
GOING TO DOMINATE EVERY

1139
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:17,406
CHALLENGE --

1140
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,158
>> Jeff: SO FAR COCHRAN'S WON

1141
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:19,325
50%.

1142
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:24,539
>> OKAY, BESIDES COCHRAN.

1143
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,040
THEY'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT

1144
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:26,582
THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER.

1145
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,584
>> Jeff: BUT SHERRI, THE

1146
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,126
RATIONALE COULD BE I'M NOT

1147
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,461
GETTING TO THE END WITH THE SIX

1148
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,921
BECAUSE I ALREADY FEEL LIKE I'M

1149
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:32,463
ON THE BOTTOM.

1150
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,423
>> ABSOLUTELY THAT'S CROSSED MY

1151
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:34,715
MIND.

1152
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,010
WHO KNOWS WHERE I SIT WITH THE

1153
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:38,261
FAVORITES?

1154
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:38,886
>> Jeff: DAWN, DOES THAT

1155
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,178
CONCERN YOU?

1156
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,347
>> YEAH, I WAS ACTUALLY LIKE,

1157
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,682
OH, SHERRI!

1158
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,933
I THINK THAT EVERYBODY FEELS

1159
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,476
VULNERABLE AND A LOT OF TIMES

1160
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,686
YOU'RE MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE

1161
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,105
YOU'RE THINKING "IT'S ME ON THE

1162
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:49,355
BOTTOM.

1163
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,606
IT'S ME ON THE BOTTOM."

1164
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,899
AND I THINK IN SHERRI'S CASE I

1165
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,901
HOPE SHE'S NOT THINKING SHE'S ON

1166
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,193
THE BOTTOM.

1167
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,611
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, AT THE

1168
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,321
AUCTION YOU BOUGHT WHAT WAS

1169
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,990
LABELED INFORMATION IN THE GAME.

1170
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,533
DID YOU FEEL OTHERS WONDERING

1171
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,701
WHAT THAT INFORMATION WAS?

1172
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,995
>> YEAH, IT WAS A LITTLE CRAZY

1173
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:04,453
AROUND CAMP, YOU KNOW?

1174
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,456
IT WAS MY EYES ONLY BUT EVERYONE

1175
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:07,999
HERE'S CURIOUS.

1176
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,166
IT WAS A FUN DAY.

1177
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,209
>> Jeff: ANDREA, WHAT WAS THE

1178
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:10,501
SPECULATION?

1179
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,295
>> I THINK MOST OF US THOUGHT

1180
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,547
THIS WAS A CLUE TO THE HIDDEN

1181
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,339
IMMUNITY IDOL AND I'M 80% SURE

1182
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,925
HE HAS IT.

1183
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,844
>> Jeff: DAWN, WHY SO MUCH

1184
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,345
CONCERN AND FEAR AROUND THE

1185
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:21,554
IDOL?

1186
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,513
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING

1187
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,015
PLAYED SO OFTEN!

1188
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,059
I THINK IT'S JUST THIS

1189
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:27,435
REINTRODUCTION.

1190
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,519
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THEM.

1191
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,061
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING THEM.

1192
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,855
>> WE'RE MAKING IT RAIN.

1193
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:34,775
>> THEY'RE WORKING!

1194
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,818
>> Jeff: HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU

1195
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,111
THAT SOMEBODY WITHIN THE SIX

1196
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:38,154
MIGHT BE FLIPPING TONIGHT?

1197
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,071
>> OH, YEAH.

1198
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,948
I MEAN, IT'S TEMPTING, OH, IF I

1199
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:41,532
FEEL LIKE I'M WORRIED I SHOULD

1200
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,409
TRADE UP FOR A NEW ALLIANCE.

1201
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,786
WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN IN OTHER

1202
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,038
SEASONS OF "SURVIVOR."

1203
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,414
>> Jeff: SO, COCHRAN, ANOTHER

1204
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,749
OPTION IS SOMEBODY FROM THIS

1205
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,460
GROUP FLIPS AND JOINS EDDIE,

1206
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:52,960
MALCOLM, AND REYNOLD.

1207
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,256
>> YEAH, I MEAN, JUST HYPE

1208
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,508
HYPOTHETICALLY THREE VOTES

1209
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,801
EDDIE, THREE VOTES MALL COMM.

1210
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,928
THOSE GUYS ARE VOTING TOGETHER

1211
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,221
AS A THREESOME.

1212
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,347
THAT MEANS ALL IT TAKES IS ONE

1213
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,890
OF THE THREE OF THE SIX TO JUMP

1214
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,350
OVER TO THAT THREESOME AND

1215
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,809
SUDDENLY THEY'RE A FOURSOME,

1216
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,393
THAT'S WHERE THINGS GET

1217
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,853
EXCITING.

1218
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:11,395
AND THEN THEY CAN KICK OUT

1219
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:11,812
WHOEVER THEY WANT.

1220
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,981
AND IF THAT PERSON WHO FLIPPED

1221
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,900
OVER TO THE THREE, SIX OF THOSE

1222
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,152
THREE, THEN IT'S 4-4 AND IT'S A

1223
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:19,362
WHOLE NEW GAME.

1224
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,155
>> Jeff: SO ANDREA, HOW MUCH

1225
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,949
FEAR DOES IT PUT INTO YOU AS YOU

1226
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:23,741
GET READY TO VOTE?

1227
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,034
>> I'M NERVOUS.

1228
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,285
I'M SURE I'M BEING TARGETED

1229
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:26,869
TONIGHT SO THERE WILL PROBABLY

1230
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,371
BE VOTES GOING MY WAY BUT I

1231
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,288
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO

1232
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,124
TRUST THE GROUP OF PEOPLE YOU'RE

1233
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:36,087
WITH.

1234
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,714
>> Jeff: IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

1235
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:55,356
BRENDA, YOU'RE UP.

1236
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,692
>> I'M JUST HOPING ONE OF YOU

1237
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:07,994
THREE GUYS GOES HOME.

1238
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,453
>> I REALLY HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE

1239
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,664
THAT IDOL BECAUSE VOTING YOU OFF

1240
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,332
WOULD JUST BE SO DELICIOUS IT

1241
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,376
WOULD BE INDESCRIBABLY

1242
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:15,626
DELICIOUS.

1243
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:33,310
IT WOULD JUST BE --

1244
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,938
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1245
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:41,902
VOTES.

1246
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,904
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1247
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,031
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW

1248
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:57,126
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1249
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:57,710
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ THE

1250
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,836
DECISION IS FINAL.

1251
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,129
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1252
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:00,671
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1253
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,673
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1254
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,467
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1255
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,553

1258
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:17,063
ONE VOTE EACH, REYNOLD, MALCOLM,

1259
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,399

WE HAVE A THREE-WAY TIE.

1271
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,604
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO

1272
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:58,813
RELOAD.

1273
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,232
REYNOLD, MALCOLM AND ANDREA, YOU

1274
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,858
WON'T VOTE.

1275
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,692
EVERYONE ELSE YOU CAN ONLY VOTE

1276
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,444
FOR ONE OF THOSE THREE.

1277
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:22,503
ERIK, COME GRAB THIS.

1278
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:33,556
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1280
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:44,066

MALCOLM, THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S

1286
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:53,534
ENOUGH.

1287
00:40:53,617 --> 00:41:01,584
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1288
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,543
>> OH, DAMN IT.

1289
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,337
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, THE TRIBE

1290
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,630
HAS SPOKEN.

1291
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,548
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1292
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,176
>> BEST OF LUCK, GUYS.

1293
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,635
>> BYE, MALCOLM!

1294
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,136

00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,145
EDDIE, YOU'VE BEEN ON THE

1299
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,938
OUTSIDE OF THIS GAME SINCE DAY

1300
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:23,647
ONE AND 30 DAYS LATER NOTHING

1301
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,482
HAS CHANGED.

1302
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,109
BUT YOU'RE STILL ALIVE AND

1303
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,320
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS FOR

1304
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:29,695
ANYBODY TONIGHT.

1305
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,572
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

1306
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:31,739
CAMP.

1307
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:37,661
GOOD NIGHT.

"SURVIVOR" -- ONE PERSON IS

1315
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,674
WALKING OUT OF HERE WITH

1316
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:50,925
IMMUNITY.

1317
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,927
REYNOLD, THE BIGGEST THREAT IN

1318
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,552
THE GAME TRIES TO HOLD ON FOR

1319
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,512
DEAR LIFE.

1320
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,972
REYNOLD, ANOTHER INCREDIBLE

1321
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:57,264
RECOVERY!

1322
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,557
BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE IN

1323
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:58,766
TROUBLE.

1324
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,101
>> WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD GO

1325
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:01,477
FIRST?

1326
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:01,936
BRENDA OR DAWN?

1327
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,686
>> I THINK TODAY IS THE

1328
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,605
BEGINNING OF THE END FOR THE

1329
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,690
ALLIANCE OF SIX.

1330
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,613
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

1331
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,990
IT'S BEEN A GREAT RIDE.

1332
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,868
I SPENT $480 ON AN IDOL CLUE AND

1333
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,744
DIDN'T FIND THE IDOL.

1334
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,037
I FOUND TWO WITHOUT PAYING AND

1335
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,705
CAN'T FIND THE ONE I PAY FOR.

1336
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,289
PROBABLY GOING GET A LITTLE

1337
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:22,790
MOCKING AFTER THIS BUT I

1338
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,541
WOULDN'T HAVE PLAYED IT TONIGHT

1339
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:24,792
ANYWAYS.

1340
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,251
I THOUGHT I WAS SAFE.

1341
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,585
IT JUST SHOWS YOU AS SOON AS YOU

1342
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,586
THINK YOU'VE FIGURED IT OUT

1343
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,170
YOU'RE GOING HOME AND TONIGHT

1344
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,505
WAS MY TIME.

1345
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,590
I GOT BURNED PRETTY BAD.
