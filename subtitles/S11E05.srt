>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:03,753
<i>Survivor...</i> Yaxha dodged deadly

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,338
visitors.

4
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,090
>> Wow.

5
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,091
>> It ate something.

6
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:08,675
That could have been one of us

7
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,427
if we were swimming across its

8
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,428
path.

9
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,429
>> What?

10
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,471
>> A fish got me.

11
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,389
>> PROBST: Then everything

12
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,015
changed when the tribes were

13
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:16,474
unexpectedly switched.

14
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,058
Drop your buffs.

15
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,102
>> Oh, my God!

16
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,145
>> PROBST: Danni, Brandon,

17
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,480
Bobby Jon and Blake were the new

18
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,149
members of Yaxha, and Jamie,

19
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,859
Lydia, Rafe and Stephenie

20
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,152
joined Nakum.

21
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,987
At the new Nakum tribe,

22
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,196
Stephenie and Jamie approached

23
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,991
Judd about turning on his old

24
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,242
tribe mate Brooke.

25
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,660
>> Then we'll get rid of Brooke.

26
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,995
>> Like I said, man, I'm all

27
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:37,454
with you guys, man.

28
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,289
I'm all for that, man.

29
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,498
>> PROBST: And Margaret felt

30
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,124
uneasy about Judd's loyalties.

31
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,460
>> With this switch-up today, I

32
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,461
don't feel safe at all.

33
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,004
>> I know I'm the big gun around

34
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,005
here.

35
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,006
You feel like you're King Kong,

36
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:48,256
man.

37
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,634
(<i> deep, raspy hooting</i> )

38
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,052
>> PROBST: At Yaxha, Brian, Amy

39
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,888
and Gary felt the pressure of

40
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,264
being outnumbered by their new

41
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,140
tribe mates, three to four.

42
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,768
>> We're decimated here.

43
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,351
>> PROBST: Blake and Bobby Jon

44
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,103
shared a private moment to

45
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:07,192
confirm their game plan.

46
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,193
>> Bobby and I, you know, had a

47
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,194
little bathroom break and a

48
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,111
little pep talk.

49
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:10,653
We already picked the order.

50
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,321
It's Amy, Brian and Gary out the

51
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,989
door.

52
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:13,990
>> PROBST: At the immunity

53
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:14,365
challenge...

54
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,200
>> Come on, Brian, keep on

55
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:15,658
popping them, Brandon.

56
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,035
>> PROBST: Yaxha threw their way

57
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:17,327
to victory.

58
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,747
Yaxha wins immunity!

59
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,499
Back at Nakum, Margaret

60
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,375
pressured Judd to vote off Lydia

61
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,127
and keep the four former Nakum

62
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,796
members united.

63
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,005
>> They're going to be four,

64
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,089
we'll be three.

65
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:30,715
They can pick us off one by one.

66
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,341
>> PROBST: And Judd doubted his

67
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,301
new alliance.

68
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,431
>> My biggest concern right now,

69
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,182
of course, is Jamie and

70
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,226
Stephenie not being as loyal as

71
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,685
they say they are.

72
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,686
So, when I go to Tribal Council,

73
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,813
I don't know who I'm going to

74
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,272
choose.

75
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,066
>> PROBST: But in the end, Judd

76
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,150
turned his back on his former

77
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,610
tribe mates and helped vote out

78
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,319
Brooke.

79
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,197
Brooke, the tribe has spoken.

80
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,491
14 are left.

81
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,453

Judd flipped the very first day

00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,952
the new tribe came to be, and he

119
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,495
didn't bother to look back.

120
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,122
He's a traitor.

121
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,919
>> Now that is an inappropriate

122
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,170
statement.

125
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,589
playing the game I'm playing.

126
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,925
It's a tough game, man.

127
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:19,884
As long as my wife and my

128
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,510
daughter and my family love me,

129
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,303
that's all that matters to me,

me.

133
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,725
I want to see how it plays out.

134
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,185
I hope my alliance stays the way

135
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:29,394
it is.

136
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,478
Margaret, she's probably not too

137
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,480
happy with it, but I really

138
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,606
don't care whether she's happy

139
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,607
or not.

140
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,609
I can't wait until she goes,

141
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,653
too.

142
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,639
>> This morning I'm sitting here

143
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,515
thinking about, you know, how am

144
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,143
I sitting in this game right now

145
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,519
and what chances do I have at

146
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,478
this point?

147
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,604
I think I've got a pretty good

148
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,397
chance.

149
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,606
The group I have over here, with

150
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,108
Yaxha, there's seven of us and

151
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,359
four of us from the original

152
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,319
Nakum: Bobby Jon, Brandon, Danni

153
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,363
and I.

154
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,865
I don't think it could have

155
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,991
worked out better.

156
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,284
We came over here with the new

157
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,243
Yaxha tribe.

158
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,327
We have the odds.

159
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,412
Gary and Brian and Amy are

160
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,330
amazing, but they've got to know

161
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,041
they got a target on their back

162
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:33,708
if we lose.

163
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,586
So I'm liking my odds right now.

164
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,047
>> Aah! What is that?

165
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,006
>> It's a beetle.

166
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,340
>> Get it out of here.

167
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,842
Get it the ... out of here!

168
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,885
I don't want it near me.

169
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,886
>> It's chasing you.

170
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,887
>> Whoa, it landed right on your

171
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,596
shoulder.

172
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,097
>> Get it off, get it off!

173
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,681
>> I'm just joking with you.

174
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,976
>> I didn't know beetles could

175
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,519
fly.

176
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,354
>> They're magical beetles here.

177
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,522
>> It sounded like a helicopter.

178
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,982
I was like, what is that?

179
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,817
>> Amy, she lived her whole life

180
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,109
in the city.

181
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,444
She said she's never been

182
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,030
camping or anything.

183
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,699
I don't know. I'm from Kansas.

184
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,868
The great state of Kansas.

185
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,495
And I don't know, I'm used to

186
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,830
more farming type of people--

187
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,791
maybe the rednecks, the hicks,

188
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,168
you know, that kind of people.

189
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,878
>> What do you farm?

190
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,214
>> Wheat, milo, soybeans.

191
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,799
>> So then, when you go and it's

192
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,467
done, you go and pull it out?

193
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,096
With my new Yaxha tribe, a lot

194
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:28,721
of people are constantly talking

195
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,306
about farm stuff.

196
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:30,640
I have no idea.

197
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,767
Wheat, what do you do with it?

198
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,935
>> Wheat?

199
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,811
Wheat's used for bread...

200
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,978
>> No, I know what it's used

201
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,146
for, but how do you...

202
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,315
Tell me about the process.

203
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:39,982
>> If you go out there and get a

204
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,651
planter and you put a bunch of

205
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,568
seed in your planter...

206
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,528
>> I'm like from the city, so,

207
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,405
when they talk about farming and

208
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,448
stuff, I definitely am the odd

209
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,741
man out.

210
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,659
>> You got little plows in front

211
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,576
of it and you got seed bins in

212
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,914
the back.

213
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:55,832
>> We prefer John Deere.

214
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,165
>> John Deere.

215
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,459
>> Most of these people I

216
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,044
probably wouldn't be friends

217
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,170
with outside of the game.

218
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,171
They come from different parts

219
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,005
of the country, you know.

220
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,631
I'm very New England, I'm very

221
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,674
blue state, and they're very

222
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,677
Texas and, you know, they're

223
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,762
from Tulsa, Oklahoma, or...

224
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,057
it's just not my style.

225
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,312
>> Wow.

226
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,313
You know, they're good people,

227
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,356
so I don't dislike them at all.

228
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,899
But they're just not the kind of

229
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,900
people I'm used to hanging out

230
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,651
with.

231
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,485
>> Dear Heavenly Father, in

232
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,779
Jesus' name, Lord, we thank You

233
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,364
for this day, thank You for

234
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,324
every day out here, Lord.

235
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,325
>> Our tribe is a very religious

236
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:31,784
tribe.

237
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,411
We say grace before every meal.

238
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,829
We pray before every challenge.

239
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,706
We thank Jesus for everything.

240
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,124
You know, and I'm not a

241
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,458
religious person at all.

242
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,751
But I'm not going to object to

243
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,586
it, that would be stupid.

244
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,503
You'd be stupid to say, like,

245
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,630
you know what, guys?

246
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,631
I don't want to thank Jesus for

247
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,048
this meal, thanks.

248
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,632
Because then they'd vote me

249
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,633
right out-- that's dumb.

250
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,635
Even if I object to something,

251
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,636
you have to grin and bear it.

252
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,637
That's the strategy out here.

253
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,555
>> Amen.

254
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,807
>> Amen.

255
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,851
>> Thank you.

256
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:07,570
>> PROBST: Yaxha, come on in.

257
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,281
Nakum, come on in.

258
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,534
Yaxha, getting your first look

259
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,120
at the new Nakum tribe.

260
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,455
Brooke voted out at the last

261
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,498
Tribal Council.

262
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:24,754
Tell me about life at Nakum.

263
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,340
Steph, what's the water

264
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,883
situation?

265
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,176
>> We can't go in the water.

266
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,344
The water is very muddy and

267
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:31,886
murky, so we just dump the

268
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,596
bucket over our heads to try to

269
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,597
stay cool.

270
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,598
>> PROBST: It's been over 100

271
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,599
degrees every single day we've

272
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,600
been out here.

273
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,601
The only relief you have is that

274
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,602
water.

275
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,603
>> It's miserable heat out here,

276
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,229
Jeff.

277
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,230
I mean, it sucks life out of

278
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:42,396
you.

279
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:42,980
Not to be able to just dive in

280
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:43,731
and swim around in that pretty

281
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,025
green water is a bummer.

282
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,777
We float in, we sit in waist

283
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,320
deep and splash water on

284
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:49,946
ourselves and just kind of enjoy

285
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,738
the beach.

286
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,865
>> There was a croc five feet

287
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,325
from our dock, so I'm always

288
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,409
like bitching for them to get

289
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,369
back in.

290
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,286
>> PROBST: Wait, this is news to

291
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,329
me. You've seen a croc?

292
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,205
>> I saw one this morning.

293
00:08:59,288 --> 00:08:59,872
>> PROBST: You saw one this

294
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,790
morning?

295
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,791
>> I got up this morning to

296
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,792
watch the sunrise and one swam

297
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,626
right on the shoreline.

298
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,877
He came out.

299
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,254
I just watched the five, six-

300
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:06,837
foot crocodile swim out to the

301
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,965
big part of the lake.

302
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,508
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

303
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,509
to today's challenge.

304
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:11,926
It is for reward.

305
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:12,677
Here's how it works.

306
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,845
On my go, both tribes will race

307
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,638
to the first station where one

308
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,557
tribe member will cut through a

309
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,519
rope using a sharp stone, just

310
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,103
like the ancient Maya would

311
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:22,812
have.

312
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,855
Once you cut through the rope,

313
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,148
you'll release two hammers.

314
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,400
Untie them, take them with you

315
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,776
to the second station where

316
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,444
a different tribe member will

317
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,280
chop through a log to a second

318
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,030
rope.

319
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:33,781
Once you've chopped through the

320
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,075
log and the rope, you'll release

321
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,910
two more handles.

322
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,661
You now have four handles.

323
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,955
Take those with you, race up the

324
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,165
platform, where four different

325
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:43,749
tribe members will take the

326
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,377
handles and put them in a

327
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,546
turnstile and begin cranking it.

328
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,047
As you crank that turnstile, you

329
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,799
will bring a cart up the hill,

330
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,344
closer and closer toward you.

331
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:55,970
Once that cart reaches the top,

332
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,472
all six tribe members who have

333
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,807
participated thus far get in the

334
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,350
cart.

335
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,727
That leaves one tribe member

336
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,853
left.

337
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,979
Their sole responsibility, take

338
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,564
a machete, chop the final rope;

339
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,982
that will release the cart and

340
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,568
send it screaming down the hill.

341
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,569
>> Oh, my gosh.

342
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,570
>> PROBST: First tribe to the

343
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,571
finish wins reward.

344
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,572
Want to know what you're playing

345
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:14,739
for?

346
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,781
>> Yes, sir!

347
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,284
>> PROBST: Very few things can

348
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,660
take the edge off of an

349
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,786
unbearably hot day.

350
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,123
This is certainly one of them.

351
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,418
For the winners, margaritas,

352
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,254
chip and dip with guacamole.

353
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:30,880
Granted, it would be nice if you

354
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,923
could go back to a refreshing

355
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,300
body of water, as if there

356
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,885
weren't crocs-- make it a little

357
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,011
better, wouldn't it?

358
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,304
>> Yeah.

359
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,139
>> PROBST: Second part of the

360
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,724
reward for the winning tribe, a

361
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,809
floating, crocodile-proof swim

362
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,186
cage.

363
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,896
>> Yes!

364
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,189
>> PROBST: Delivered to your

365
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,273
camp, complete with decking,

366
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,735
lounge chairs and an umbrella.

367
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,779
>> Oh, my gosh.

368
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,405
>> Just for today?

369
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,282
>> PROBST: Stays at your camp.

370
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,201
Give you a minute to strategize

371
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,328
and we'll get started.

372
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,124
Here we go.

373
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,334
For reward.

374
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:08,751
Survivors ready?

375
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,253
Go!

376
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,380
>> Let Jamie go.

377
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,547
>> PROBST: Strategy critical in

378
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:13,923
this.

379
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,675
Jamie and Brandon getting to

380
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,218
work on the rope using the

381
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:17,802
stones.

382
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,970
>> Go, Jamie!

383
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,180
>> PROBST: Brandon kind of

384
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,223
hacking at it.

385
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,224
He's through the first rope very

386
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,725
quickly.

387
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,893
Brandon's got a strategy, using

388
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,395
some leverage.

389
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,354
Jamie's still working on that

390
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,730
first rope.

391
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,856
Time is critical at this first

392
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,982
station.

393
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:32,900
Lose it and it's hard to make

394
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,235
up.

395
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,194

404
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:52,753
Yaxha with a big lead.

405
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,922
Jamie's still back on the first

406
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,715
rope, losing a lot of time for

407
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:56,924
Nakum.

408
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:57,883

418
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,648
Jamie still struggling.

419
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,650

closer for Yaxha.

Jamie not giving up, but not

447
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,450
anywhere close to finishing.

nice, refreshing afternoon.

Jamie, it falls on you.

494
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,829
Head on back to camp.

Today, Yaxha, we're superstars.

>> This is amazing.

502
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,480
The reward was spectacular.

503
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,609
Look at this setup, man!

504
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,610
Oh, my God!

505
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,612
>> No crocodiles in that water.

506
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,614
>> Oh, man!

507
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,197
I'm so excited about the dang

508
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,158
thing.

509
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,075
It's a huge pool with, like,

510
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,369
lounge chairs.

511
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,621
The whole thing is caged in.

512
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,788
I thought it was going to be

513
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,831
like one cage for one person.

514
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:16,957
We all fit in there.

515
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,583
I didn't imagine it was going to

516
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,126
be that good.

517
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,294
>> Jackpot, baby!

518
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,003
>> Take everything on it and

519
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,087
enjoy.

520
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:22,963
>> Cheers.

521
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,006
>> Cheers.

522
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,549
>> God.

523
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,550
>> Brandon, you kick butt.

524
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,551
>> He made that contest not even

525
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:27,718
fun.

526
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,344
>> Man, I was hacking at that

527
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,470
rope.

528
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,721
I was just practically bashing

529
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,473
it apart.

530
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,474
You could say that I won it for

531
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,099
Yaxha.

532
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,435
I mean, I'm not trying to take

533
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,520
all the credit or anything.

534
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,814
But gotta go in there and give

535
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,107
it 110 percent, you know...

536
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,069
Give it your all.

537
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,612
>> Why didn't anybody on the

538
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,988
other team tell Jamie to chop?

539
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,281
>> I don't know.

540
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,449
>> Not one of them said "chop."

541
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,617
Brandon used that rock like

542
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,826
an ax on that rope.

543
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,827
We've got a new superhero on our

544
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,912
team.

545
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:55,996
I know Kansas is loving him and

546
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,997
so am I.

547
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:57,998
>> This is to kicking ass and

548
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,541
staying...

(<i> all whooping, shouting</i> )

550
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,880
>> Yaxha, baby!

551
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:07,591
>> There you go, Brian.

552
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,010
>> Oh, my God.

553
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,345
God, to just, like, sink into

554
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,055
the water... no, but I got to

555
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:13,347
keep eating.

556
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,057
I can't go in yet.

557
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,059
We are having an amazing day.

558
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,811
Yaxha is on cloud nine right

559
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,311
now.

560
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,898
>> Oh, man, Gary goes all in!

561
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:23,899
How deep is that?

562
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,402
>> Oh, my God, this is the best.

563
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,613
(<i> all laughing, shouting</i> )

564
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,158
>> The Guatemalan sun, 120

565

degrees, it's a killer out here.

566
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,244
We've been wanting to swim for

567
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,246
the longest time.

568
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,414
I'm a fish back home.

569
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,457
I love the water.

570
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,960
So to be able to swim, even in

571
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:47,464
a tiny square... is heaven.

572
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,175
>> One, two, three, Yaxha!

573
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,219
(<i> all whooping</i> )

574
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,100
>> There was no way in hell you

575
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,643
were going to bang it with that

576
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,436
little rock, so...

577
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,521
>> I could, like, I tried to

578
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:02,771
bang it.

579
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,313
It wouldn't bang, you know.

580
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,148
>> Don't worry about it.

581
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,149
>> That kid was an animal though

582
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,150
with that thing.

583
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,151
It was a hard challenge, you

584
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,694
know?

585
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,695
I just feel bad to lose, you

586
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:09,903
know?

587
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,446
That was a good reward and I

588
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,780
lost it.

589
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,698
But no one could cut rope as

590
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,949
quick as Brandon can.

591
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,410
I take all of the blame.

592
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,745
>> You did the best you could

593
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,288
and that's all the tribe asks.

594
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:19,747
>> That's it, brother.

595
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,122
That's it, Jamie.

596
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,624
>> You did a great job.

597
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,834
>> Jamie apologized to

598
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,377
everybody, but I can see in

599
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,212
people's faces that they...

600
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,173
it's just like, man, what the

601
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,424
hell, what the hell did he do,

602
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,175
man?

603
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,343
We just got our asses kicked.

604
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,181
You know, we're a team, man.

605
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,223
You can't fall apart.

606
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,850
You can't blame anybody.

607
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,185
A team doesn't work like that.

608
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,770
Jamie, he tried every freakin'

609
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,187
thing he could do.

610
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,229
What are you gonna do, man?

611
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,189
>> None of us could have done

612
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,860
anything more.

613
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,241
>> I just thought it was going

614
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,242
to take... I knew the technique,

615
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,285
but I thought...

616
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,995
>> Well, if you know the

617
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,038
technique, then you got to step

618
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:01,955
up, man.

619
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,748
>> No, but I don't have the

620
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,791
shoulder and upper body strength

621
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,708
that you or Jamie would have.

622
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,751
>> I'm just saying, by all

623
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,835
means, if you and Margaret ever

624
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,795
want to step up to the plate,

625
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,588
man, be my guest, man.

626
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,255
You step up to the damn plate

627
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,174
and you do what you gotta do and

628
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,635
get one of us out of the spot...

629
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,552
>> I understand.

630
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,470
If you think you can do better,

631
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:16,887
then do it-- right.

632
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,763
>> You go at it, man.

633
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,680
>> I understand that.

634
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,765
>> Get us out of the spotlight

635
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,891
for a little bit and shine like

636
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:21,892
the star that you think you are.

637
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:22,684
That's it, man.

638
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,686
That's all I'm saying.

639
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,646
>> When we got back from the

640
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,605
challenge, Judd was mouthing

641
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,648
off about if you think you can

642
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,690
do something better, it's time

643
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,733
to step up, don't put all the

644
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,026
weight on all the guys.

645
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:31,527
So it made me really mad.

646
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,487
Some of these people are just

647
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,822
going out of their way to

648
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:35,364
irritate the other ones, and

649
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,324
I just don't think that's a very

650
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,368
smart thing.

651
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,120
>> Bobby Jon's in the cart

652
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,247
kicking his legs, cheering like

653
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,373
a frickin' girl.

654
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,916
I wanted to knock him out.

655
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,167
I'm happy for Bobby Jon, that

656
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,669
he's winning, because I know how

657
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,212
it is to lose, and it sucks.

658
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,505
But it annoys me when I watch

659
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,256
him win.

660
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,591
He cheers like a freakin' girl.

661
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,342
So, I think it's obnoxious.

662
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,094
And I think...

663
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,889
I'm jealous, basically.

664
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,306
He's so gay.

665
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,642
He gets so gay.

666
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,102
I can't stand it.

667
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,144
>> He's overly dramatic.

668
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,312
>> Right, like, get over it.

669
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,567
>> I didn't know how to cut that

670
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:11,900
rope that way.

671
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,444
>> Can't do it all, kid.

672
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,740
>> No, no way.

673
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,741
>> Jamie is a very cocky kind of

674
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,034
guy.

675
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:21,660
He's, like, "I can cut rope with

676
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,704
a rock, no problem.

677
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,080
I can fly right through that."

678
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,206
And he gets in there and gets

679
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,749
his ass beat by a 22-year-old

680
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,835
farm boy who basically saws

681
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,336
through the rope in, like, 30

682
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,546
seconds.

683
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,964
They get the whole challenge

684
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,173
done and frickin' Jamie can't

685
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,174
even cut the second rope.

686
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,175
You don't have to make it that

687
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:37,718
thin.

688
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,635
I'm just pissed.

689
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,219
I mean, I'm sick of losing.

690
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,306
I can't do this again, but I am

691
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,307
just trying really hard, when

692
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,308
I'm up in camp, to keep my mouth

693
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,475
shut.

694
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,268
I'm never going to cry in front

695
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,353
of any of them, ever.

696
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,314
I'm never going to tell them how

697
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,482
I really feel, but deep down in

698
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,651
me, my heart is breaking.

699
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,403
I mean, inside, I'm like

700
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,905
collapsing really.

701
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,491
Whew!

702
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,951
I just feel like I'm a really

703
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,036
bad...

704
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,663
I'm in a really bad dream and I

705
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,707
can't get out, no matter what.

706
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,843
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

707
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,387
>> Whoa!

708
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,098
>> Oh, my God.

709
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,308
>> I do not want to relive what

710
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,269
I just went through on Palau.

711
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,604
And the same thing is happening

712
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,480
over again.

713
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,357
For some reason, the group I'm

714
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,819
always in is the less able

715
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,237
group, and the group that

716
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,366
basically... sucks.

717
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,975
>> It's been raining for a

718
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,643
couple hours, maybe an hour

719
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,853
or something like that.

720
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,146
We're huddled under a frickin'

721
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,190
umbrella and it sucks.

722
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,449
>> Somehow, Brian and Blake are

723
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,576
still sleeping, man, under the

724
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,203
shelter that we've got, and we

725
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,496
couldn't sleep under it worth a

726
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,831
damn, and somehow, those guys

727
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,082
haven't come out yet.

728
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,834
Either they found a dry spot or

729
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,627
they're just beefing through the

730
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,671
wetness and the rain.

731
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,174
>> Golden boy.

732
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,259
>> Golden boy.

733
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,261
>> It's like, ♪ ahh... ♪

734
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,178
I came up with the name Golden

735
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,221
Boy for Blake 'cause he always

736
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,681
comes up smelling like roses.

737
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,057
He's going to make out great in

738
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:49,891
life, you know?

739
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,434
That's just him.

740
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,311
Plus, he also has the greatest

741
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,438
stories.

742
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,564
>> I started skydiving...

743
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,481
>> Really?

744
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,399
>> Yeah, I've got about 70

745
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,985
skydives in.

State champion tennis player

747
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,195
in high school...

748
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,488
Now I'm 24 and not married.

749
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,490
I was dating a lot and now

750
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,616
I have a girlfriend, a pretty

751
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,242
amazing girl.

752
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:07,868
I see a lot of older women, and

753
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,494
that kind of got me in trouble

754
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:09,786
for a while.

755
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,412
So it was like, I slowed that

756
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,414
down and...

757
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,332
>> Blake talks about himself all

758
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,083
the time.

759
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:15,667
All this, you know, he seems

760
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,586
like Captain America.

761
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,879
He's always talking himself up.

762
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,672
It's like, you know, God.

763
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,883
>> My girlfriend, she's got

764
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,968
double D.

765
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:25,510
She's got big boobs.

766
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,512
>> Really?

767
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,722
>> But then she got the pill and

768
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,058
they get bigger.

769
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,059
Geez, they just keep growing.

770
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,060
They were D's and now, they're

771
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:33,894
like almost double D's.

772
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:34,686
>> Man, that's too big.

773
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,104
That's gross.

774
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,189
>> I'm not even a boob man.

775
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,231
Bobby Jon and I were talking.

776
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,357
We're legs and ass kind of guys.

777
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,152
Brandon?

778
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,779
>> Novelty-size boobs, I don't

779
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,697
know about that.

780
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,698
>> Anyway, we went to Victoria's

781
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:46,948
Secret...

782
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,242
>> Blake is such an idiot.

783
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,452
He has to make himself look like

784
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,703
such a pretty boy, frat boy,

785
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,788
wealthy boy-- it's great.

786
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,164
I have a new favorite game out

787
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,248
here.

788
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,250
It's called "Bait Blake."

789
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:57,793
Blake, what is your absolute

790
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,086
best drunk story?

791
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,130
>> Oh, God.

792
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:02,714
My roommate-- we were all gone

793
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,549
all summer at camp, I thought

794
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,884
I'd have a party at my place.

795
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,635
We're doing shots, everybody's

796
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,428
getting hammered...

797
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,138
>> I'm trying to make sure he

798
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:10,680
tells all his stories around

799
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,766
people like Danni and Bobby Jon

800
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,767
so they see what a moron Blake

801
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:13,934
is.

802
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,477
This is awesome.

803
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,978
>> So what you're saying, Blake,

804
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,021
is that I wouldn't want one of

805
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,272
my three daughters to date you?

806
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,774
>> No, no.

807
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,359
I'm pretty feisty, Gary.

808
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,401
You wouldn't want 'em anywhere

809
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:23,985
near me.

810
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,986
>> He's just digging himself

811
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,446
into a hole, and I am gonna do

812
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,447
everything I can to make sure

813
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,448
he has a shovel.

814
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,741
>> Yeah.

815
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,798
>> Uh-oh, tree mail.

816
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,801
>> Oh, geez.

817
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,885
>> Look like something Hercules

818
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,178
would throw over the head.

819
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,888

820

Work together, this could be

825
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,692
fun.

826
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,277
Race around, push and shove,

827
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,528
Will old friends be respected?

828
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,364
Fail to catch immunity, you may

829
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,075
be the next one here ejected."

830
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,202
We just got tree mail.

831
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,412
It looks like it's going to be

832
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:15,787
very strenuous.

833
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,123
I have unfortunately seemed to

834
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:18,748
have been on one tribe that was

835
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,584
on a losing streak, and now I

836
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,419

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,338

Here's how today's challenge

920
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,899
will work.

921
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,817
Each tribe will divide into two

922
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,236
groups of three.

923
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,862
Those groups will take a spot

924
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,573
downfield and you'll be holding

925
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,991
a Maya catch net.

926
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,117
That leaves one tribe member

927
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,368
from each tribe.

928
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:00,952
They will alternate launching

929
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,581
balls from a catapult downfield

930
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,206
while the groups maneuver to try

931
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,833
to catch the ball.

932
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,252
You can catch any ball from

933
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,338
either tribe member at any time.

934
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:11,880
The first tribe with five

935
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,798
catches wins immunity.

936
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,092
Losers, Tribal Council, somebody

Give you a minute to strategize.

939
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,307

Brian's up first.

943
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,780
Makes his selection.

944
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,906
Places the ball in the trough.

945
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,867
He is locked and loaded.

946
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,369
Once the ball is in the air, you

947
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,079
can leave your mat.

948
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:48,458
Brian takes his aim far right.

949
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,418
And he launches.

950
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,337
Heading towards Bobby Jon, Gary

951
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,005
and Danni.

952
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,173
>> Yes!

953
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,758
>> PROBST: Score for Yaxha.

954
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,343
>> Good job, Yaxha.

955
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,469
>> PROBST: Yaxha leads.

956
00:27:59,552 --> 00:27:59,844
One, zip.

957
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,847
Lydia takes her first shot.

958
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,432
>> Come on, Lydia!

959
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,517
>> PROBST: Lydia takes a spot at

960
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,935
the catapult, takes a little

961
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,853
aim.

962
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,481
Her first shot and it's

963
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,608
launched.

964
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,026
It's deep.

965
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,236
>> Right, right, right.

966
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,404
>> PROBST: Oh, Yaxha had a shot

967
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,196
at it, couldn't do it.

968
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,197
>> You guys, we gotta be a

969
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,781
little faster.

970
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,782
Yeah, but I got to box it, too,

971
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,408
man.

972
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,659
>> I know, but listen to me,

973
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,159
because it's going deep.

974
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:23,743
They'll never get near us.

975
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,953
>> PROBST: Steph, Judd and Rafe

976
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,996
talking it through.

977
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,542
Brian's up.

978
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:34,379
Brian takes his aim.

979
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,423
And he launches high and short.

980
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,049
>> Got it, got it, got it!

981
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,093
Got it, got it, got it!

982
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,553
>> PROBST: Nakum steals one.

983
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,138
Judd, Rafe and Steph!

984
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,765
We're tied, one-one.

985
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,559
Playing to five.

986
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,643
Lydia.

987
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:49,811
>> All the way, Lydia.

988
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,104
>> PROBST: Lydia going right

989
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,899
back to the same spot.

990
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,984
And it's in the air.

991
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,986
The tribes moving.

992
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,779
Brandon hits the deck.

993
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,906
Nobody gets it.

994
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,949
Good defense by Yaxha.

995
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,826
>> It's all right.

996
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,244
>> PROBST: Still tied.

997
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,245
Brian up.

998
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,163
>> Turn it as much as you can,

999
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,247
Bri.

1000
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,165
>> I got it.

1001
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,249
>> You guys, get ready to back

1002
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,542
up, they're on the left.

1003
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,085
>> PROBST: Brian takes his aim,

1004
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,712
far right.

1005
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,505
He launches it quickly towards

1006
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,132
Gary, Danni and Bobby Jon.

1007
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,259
But they can't connect.

1008
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,179
Stephenie plowed into Bobby Jon.

1009
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,680
>> They didn't catch it.

1010
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:26,973
>> PROBST: Lydia going back to

1011
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,767
the same spot.

1012
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,144
Lydia launches one deep toward

1013
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,314
Rafe, Judd and Steph...

1014
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,815
and they connect!

1015
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,024
>> Yes!

1016
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,026
Nakum leads, two-one.

1017
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,362
Brian up for Yaxha.

1018
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,666
Yaxha connects.

1019
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,918
Yaxha ties it up.

1020
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:55,210
Two, two.

1021
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,420
>> Good job, Bri.

1022
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,798
>> PROBST: Lydia, quick aim.

1023
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,592
She launches.

1024
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:02,967
It's deep.

1025
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,886
Nakum could get it.

1026
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,721
And they do.

1027
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:08,181
>> Whoo! Yeah!

1028
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:08,598
>> Good shot, Lydia!

1029
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,350
>> PROBST: Nakum back in the

1030
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,726
lead, three, two.

1031
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,977
Brian up.

1032
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,772
Immunity on the line.

1033
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,814
>> I'm not looking, I'm just

1034
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,734
going straight back, you guys.

1035
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,528
>> PROBST: He launches.

1036
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,029
>> Got it, got it, got it.

1037
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,156
Nakum steals one.

1038
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,907
>> Wow!

1039
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,409
>> Yeah!

1040
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,536
>> PROBST: Nakum leads.

1041
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,579
Four, two.

1042
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:31,955
Lydia.

1043
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,997
>> This is it, Nakum.

1044
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,916
>> PROBST: Nakum could win it

1045
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:35,959
here.

1046
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,835
>> Yaxha, knock 'em down.

1047
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,087
>> PROBST: Yaxha needs to steal

1048
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,047
one.

1049
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,881
Launches it.

1050
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,634
For the win if Nakum gets it...

1051
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,929
And they do!

1052
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,807
Nakum wins immunity!

1053
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,892
>> Who's smiling now?

1054
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,061
Who's smiling now?

1055
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,312
>> Whoo!

1056
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,022
>> Yes! Lydia!

1057
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,941
Come here! You!

1058
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,734
You did it!

1059
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,571
(<i> whooping, shouting</i> )

1060
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,197
>> Go get that...

1061
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,827
>> PROBST: Nakum... immunity.

1062
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,996
A break from Tribal Council.

1063
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,247
Hopefully that will lift the

1064
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,207
spirits a little bit.

1065
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,543
Yaxha-- other end of the

1066
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,295
spectrum, somebody going home.

1067
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,504
You have the afternoon to figure

1068
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,255
out who it's going to be.

1069
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,256
See you at Tribal.

1070
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,300
Head on back.

1071
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,362
>> It was our time to lose.

1072
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,281
>> This doesn't feel very good.

1073
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,282
>> No, it don't.

1074
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,158
>> Jamie's like, "Who's the

1075
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,701
baller now?

1076
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,160
Who's the baller now?"

1077
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,161
>> I didn't even hear him say

1078
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,495
that.

1079
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,872
>> I'm like, "Jamie, why don't

1080
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,956
you just shut up and go cut a

1081
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,373
rope or something?"

1082
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,000
>> All that frustration on that

1083
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,918
rope came out.

1084
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:01,502
>> Uh-huh.

1085
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,629
>> Oh, that burns me up.

1086
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,254
There's a way to win and there's

1087
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,714
a way to lose.

1088
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,132
He's from Georgia, too.

1089
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,092
Alabama, Georgia kind of have

1090
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:08,718
rivals.

1091
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,469
>> Really?

1092
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,470
>> Yeah.

1093
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,221
>> We lost immunity, which was

1094
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,681
disappointing.

1095
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,849
The Yaxha tribe is going into

1096
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,559
Tribal Council tonight with four

1097
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,186
old Nakum members and three old

1098
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:18,519
Yaxha members.

1099
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,563
So the math is right there.

1100
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,731
It's four to three.

1101
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,483
So you would think that it would

1102
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,484
be either me, Gary or Amy going

1103
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,777
tonight, and it very well may

1104
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,487
be.

1105
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,488
What have you been hearing?

1106
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,489
>> Nobody is talking to me.

1107
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,490
They don't talk about

1108
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,449
alliances...

1109
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,575
I know that Blake's driving

1110
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,868
everybody crazy.

1111
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,244
>> So, hopefully...

1112
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,121
>> So, I know Danni and Brandon

1113
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,332
and Bobby Jon are pretty tight

1114
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,667
>> Yeah. We are at risk.

1115
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,293
I don't know what they're going

1116
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:42,752
to do.

1117
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,212
But would you be okay voting for

1118
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,546
Blake?

1119
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,506
>> Oh, in a second.

1120
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,173
He's driving everybody crazy.

1121
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,175
>> I really feel like Danni

1122
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,219
would vote for Blake before

1123
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,096
she'd vote for me or you.

1124
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,597
>> Yeah, yeah.

1125
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:54,889
>> I hope.

1126
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,349
>> We've just got to make sure

1127
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,517
that one of them votes for

1128
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:57,809
Blake, yeah.

1129
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,643
>> Okay.

1130
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,060
>> Good, good, good.

1131
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,896
>> This Blake thing, driving

1132
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,064
everybody crazy has been really

1133
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,775
good for us Yaxha members.

1134
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,735
Our only hope in the game is to

1135
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,570
get somebody to turn from the

1136
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,447
original Nakum against Blake.

1137
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,156
I just want to see somebody

1138
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,867
that's hard-working that has a

1139
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,326
good attitude win it.

1140
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,120
>> Mm-hmm, I feel the same way.

1141
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,121
>> You know?

1142
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,122
You hate to see somebody get

1143
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,123
to the final four that doesn't

1144
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,124
deserve it.

1145
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,125
We just can't let that happen

1146
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:28,214
this time.

1147
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,132
You know, I do agree that's

1148
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,759
best, though if that needs

1149
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,343
to happen.

1150
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,137
I just don't want to start, you

1151
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,013
know, going back on words and

1152
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:36,472
all that.

1153
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,433
I've given Blake my word that,

1154
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,351
you know, I wouldn't vote for

1155
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:40,685
him.

1156
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,937
But I listen to Gary a lot

1157
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,523
because he's smart and he knows

1158
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,107
about team unity.

1159
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,526
I do know there's going to be

1160
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,277
some times where I am going to

1161
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,904
have to switch my vote, and I

1162
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,614
feel like right now is not one

1163
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,658
of those times.

1164
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,540
>> Uh-huh.

1165
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,833
>> I know you're with him from

1166
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:04,292
the beginning.

1167
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,251
>> I feel the same way.

1168
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,294
>> I talked to Bobby Jon.

1169
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,128
>> What did he say?

1170
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,588
>> He wants to vote for Brian.

1171
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,964
>> I think maybe Bobby Jon

1172
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,257
thinks we all have an alliance,

1173
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:11,632
which we do not.

1174
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,216
None of us were aligned

1175
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,134
originally.

1176
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,135
>> No. At this point in the

1177
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,180
game, I want good people to go

1178
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:17,764
forward.

1179
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:18,264
>> Yeah.

1180
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,141
>> I want Blake gone first.

1181
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,518
>> Gary came up to me to talk

1182
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,520
about Blake.

1183
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,271
And Gary just said he couldn't

1184
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,648
vote for somebody who didn't

1185
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,233
deserve to go any further, so I

1186
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,109
said I felt is same way and I

1187
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,779
just needed to go talk to the

1188
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:33,821
rest of the team.

1189
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,323
>> Gary swears he's with us.

1190
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,324
>> You've talked to him about

1191
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,158
it?

1192
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,453
>> I've talked to him about it.

1193
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,083
>> I'm going to tell you right

1194
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,835
now, I'm not going to vote for

1195
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,044
Blake.

1196
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:48,669
You know, because we're strong.

1197
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,295
We got 'em... right now.

1198
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,172
I'm probably going to vote

1199
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,174
for... I don't know, Amy or

1200
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,260
Brian.

1201
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,229
>> Lights come on, pull

1202
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,188
over, gives us both a warning

1203
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,106
for not having proper signal

1204
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,565
devices and whistles.

1205
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,358
I'm like, dude, we rented these

1206
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,943
for two hours.

1207
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:12,860
We don't live here.

1208
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,861
We live in south, downtown

1209
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,403
Dallas.

1210
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,154
>> You know, the whole Blake

1211
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:15,780
situation, we're not sure what's

1212
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,073
going to happen with that.

1213
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,282
Everybody is getting a little

1214
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:18,658
fed up with him.

1215
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,660
I like the guy, he's a good guy.

1216
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:21,244
He's just young and it's just

1217
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,287
typical frat boy stuff.

1218
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,330
I don't like that frat boy stuff

1219
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,623
at all.

1220
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,208
>> Yeah, the girl I almost lost

1221
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:27,542
my virginity to.

1222
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,001
So they're...

1223
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,419
>> But he's really valuable

1224
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,004
because he's so athletic.

1225
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,006
He's great in challenges.

1226
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,425
Brandon and Bobby Jon said they

1227
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,177
wouldn't vote for him.

1228
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,097
And so it kind of comes down to

1229
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,764
my vote.

1230
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,058
And I hate being the swing vote.

1231
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,351
I mean, it's just... that's a

1232
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,936
part of the game I just don't

1233
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,311
like.

1234
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,563
Because it's going to hurt

1235
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,147
peoples' feelings, but it has to

1236
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:50,398
happen.

1237
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,858
Unfortunately it's just the way

1238
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,068
it goes sometimes.

1239
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,386
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal

1240
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,596
Council.

1241
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,388
Before we get started, how bad

1242
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,016
was the storm last night, Gary?

1243
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:25,558
>> The storm was terrible.

1244
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,894
It was definitely a character-

1245
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:28,644
building night.

1246
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,979
Two of us slept through the

1247
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:30,605
whole thing, so they got some

1248
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,648
sleep, but everybody else was

1249
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,441
out at the fire trying to keep

1250
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,192
the fire going.

1251
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:35,651
>> PROBST: Who slept?

1252
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,236
>> Brian and Blake.

1253
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,404
>> In my defense, I woke up and

1254
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,489
took the late shift.

1255
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,657
>> I just figured, they're

1256
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,950
standing by the fire, trying

1257
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,409
to stay warm.

1258
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,410
They're just cold, wet and

1259
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,161
miserable.

1260
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,162
I was like, I'm getting lucky in

1261
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:46,370
here.

1262
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:46,871
I'm ridin' the rain out.

1263
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:47,455
I thought everybody would come

1264
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,956
back in and join me.

1265
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,957
I didn't think it would be an

1266
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,667
entire night out there.

1267
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,711
>> Golden boy.

1268
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,712
>> PROBST: Is that your

1269
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,171
nickname?

1270
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,213
>> She did give me a nickname.

1271
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,340
>> PROBST: Golden Boy?

1272
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,300
>> Golden Boy, no matter what,

1273
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,551
comes out shining.

1274
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,637
He's the Golden Boy with the

1275
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,014
golden flag-- ah!-- and that

1276
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:05,681
sparkle in his tooth.

1277
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,308
>> PROBST: Blake, you're a guy

1278
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,018
that was gasping for air.

1279
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,020
You had your arms on your chest

1280
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,396
going... and now you're Golden

1281
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,397
Boy?

1282
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,398
>> I crashed and now, you know,

1283
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,399
I have perked up.

1284
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,400
I've got my wind back in my

1285
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,653
sails.

1286
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,946
I just think it was something

1287
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,113
my body had to go through.

1288
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,865
Luckily, I'm feeling better and

1289
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,533
now I think I'm ready to ride

1290
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,409
out to the end.

1291
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,287
>> PROBST: Brandon, day 14.

1292
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,206
The social aspect of this game

1293
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,415
is starting to pick up.

1294
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,917
It's a lot more than just

1295
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,085
physical challenges.

1296
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,628
Are you seeing that increase?

1297
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,212
>> Yeah.

1298
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,880
I'd say it is starting to ramp

1299
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,506
up a little.

1300
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,423
I mean, getting to know these

1301
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,926
people a little bit more.

1302
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,552
You start to like people a

1303
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,346
little bit more than others.

1304
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,974
>> PROBST: Gary, two tribes

1305
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:48,641
merged.

1306
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,351
There's four former Nakum, three

1307
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,268
former Yaxha.

1308
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,520
What were those first few

1309
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,312
moments like and how are they

1310
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,064
different now?

1311
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,399
>> The first few moments were

1312
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,025
pretty scary because you don't

1313
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,151
know where you stand.

1314
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,820
The numbers are against you.

1315
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,822
And trying to get to know

1316
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,407
everybody was just like they won

1317
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:04,699
over again.

1318
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,784
>> PROBST: Amy, do you feel like

1319
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,577
this is two groups of people

1320
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,620
living together?

1321
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,747
>> Well, I'm thinking we're one

1322
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,833
group and forget what happened

1323
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,041
before.

1324
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,002
This is my tribe and this is who

1325
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:16,585
I'm loyal to.

1326
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,670
Obviously we're at a

1327
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,755
disadvantage, but you just try

1328
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,506
to do the best you can.

1329
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,341
>> PROBST: Blake, is that the

1330
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,009
same for you?

1331
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,010
Are you guys one tribe and to

1332
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,011
heck with what happened before

1333
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:25,469
this?

1334
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,846
>> We've all come together as

1335
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,180
seven in the last few days,

1336
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:28,723
but, yeah, I mean, there's

1337
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,473
definitely bonds that I've

1338
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,642
formed with Danni and Bobby

1339
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,019
and Brandon that I haven't

1340
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,020
gotten to experience with these

1341
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:34,603
guys.

1342
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,105
That'll certainly influence me

1343
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:36,731
to some extent.

1344
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,398
>> PROBST: Brian, what do you

1345
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,817
guys have to do to encourage

1346
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,569
this group to think as a group

1347
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,945
and not down tribal lines?

1348
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:43,571
>> If that's their game plan,

1349
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,865
just to pick us off, I'm sorry

1350
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,490
that it is, because we're good

1351
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,492
people and we should take the

1352
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,869
time to get to know one another

1353
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:50,995
before you make such a snap

1354
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:51,245
judgment.

1355
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,455
So, if it's me tonight, I'm

1356
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,166
afraid I'm a victim of a

1357
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:55,750
minority.

1358
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,127
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, tonight's

1359
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,379
vote tough, easy, indifferent?

1360
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,881
>> Every Tribal Council is a

1361
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:02,882
tough vote for me.

1362
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,300
Everybody in their own way

1363
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,551
fought to get here, and

1364
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,427
somebody's about to go home

1365
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,803
tonight.

1366
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,221
Their journey is about to end.

1367
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:09,764
So, you know, I don't like

1368
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,514
ending somebody's dream.

1369
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,475
I like to keep the dream alive.

1370
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,435
>> PROBST: Okay.

1371
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,187
It is time to vote.

1372
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,938
Bobby Jon, you're up.

1373
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,161
>> You may be the Golden Boy,

1374
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,204
but I'm platinum.

1375
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,164
I hope it's you.

1376
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,060
>> You know, I think of the

1377
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:56,644
three people on the original

1378
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,729
Yaxha team, you're the weakest

1379
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,773
right now.

1380
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:12,660
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1381
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,703
votes.

1382
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:21,627
Once the votes are read, the

1383
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,545
decision is final.

1384
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,880
The person voted out will be

1385
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,298
asked to leave the Tribal

1386
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,466
Council area immediately.

1387
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,718
I'll read the votes.

1388
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,388
First vote...

1389
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,431
Blake.

1390
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,184
Brian.

1391
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,062
One vote Blake, one vote Brian.

1392
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:42,523
Brian.

1393
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,360
Two votes Brian, one vote Blake.

1394
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,196
Blake.

1395
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,656
Two votes Blake, two votes

1396
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,700
Brian.

1397
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,162
Blake.

1398
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,414
Three votes Blake, two votes

1399
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,457
Brian.

1400
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,129
The fifth person voted out of

1401
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,797
<i>Survivor: Guatemala,</i> Blake.

1402
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,090
That's four, that's enough.

1403
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,134
You need to bring me your torch.

1404
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,518
Blake, the tribe has spoken.

1405
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,979
It's time for you to go.

1406
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,023
>> Bye, guys.

1407
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,032
>> PROBST: Well, I'd say based

1408
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,491
on tonight's vote, this game

1409
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,659
just took a big shift.

1410
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,828
Grab your torches and head back

1411
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:38,829
to camp.

1412
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:39,788
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i> At Nakum, Margaret

1423
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,265
and Judd just can't get along.

1424
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:58,724
>> Judd is irritating.

1425
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,393
>> She just can't grasp the fact

1426
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,229
that the old tribe ain't coming

1427
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:03,437
back.

1429
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,564
blow.

1430
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,815
Amy's down.

1431
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,858
Amy is hurt.

1432
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,945
And Bobby Jon and Jamie square

1433
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:11,612
off.

1434
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,245
>> I didn't see it coming.

1435
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,246
I don't understand the reason

1436
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,332
for why, and that's why I'm

1437
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:23,916
kind of perplexed right now,

1438
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:24,667
and I'm kind of angry.

1439
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,585
You know, I've stepped it up in

1440
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,836
a few challenges, and I think

1441
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,004
that they were just trying

1442
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:29,630
to get out somebody strong.

1443
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,089
Why would you do that?

1444
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,382
That makes no sense.

1445
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,549
But, you know, you don't want

1446
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,175
all the strong players, I guess,

1447
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:33,801
but again, playing the odds, I

1448
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,885
don't understand why it
