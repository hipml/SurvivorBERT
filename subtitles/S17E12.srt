00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:03,712
on<i> Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,256
(gorilla grunting)

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,007
>> Obviously, Bob and I know

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,092
that our numbers are up.

6
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,218
>> PROBST: Outnumbered five to

7
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,970
two, Bob and Corinne hatched a

8
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,138
plan.

9
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,265
Step one: Bob made another fake

10
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,850
hidden immunity idol.

11
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,851
>> That would fool me.

12
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:18,435
>> PROBST: In fact, it looked

13
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,520
almost as good as the real idol

14
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,771
Sugar has had for most of the

15
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,355
game.

16
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,232
>> Thank God.

17
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,066
>> PROBST: Step two: Corinne

18
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,651
told Kenny she had an idol and

19
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,652
convinced him to flip.

20
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,278
>> Who are you guys gonna take

21
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,571
out?

22
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:30,613
>> We're taking out Matty.

23
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,614
>> PROBST: Step three: Bob

24
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,032
showed the idol to Crystal, and

25
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,616
together, they also agreed to

26
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,163
vote out Matty.

27
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,623
Then Kenny changed the plan by

28
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,041
ordering Crystal to vote for

29
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:42,417
Corinne.

30
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,710
>> You have to vote for Corinne.

31
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,087
>> Okay.

32
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:50,592
>> If this plan works out, I'll

33
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,217
be the biggest strategist in

34
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,802
<i>Survivor</i> history.

35
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,636
>> PROBST: Kenny's new plan

36
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,220
hinged on Corinne playing the

37
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,556
idol, but she couldn't because

38
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,599
it was fake.

39
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,518
So Corinne got the boot.

40
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,144
Matty received three votes and

41
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,145
was fuming.

42
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,522
Will Kenny's latest strategic

43
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,524
move come back to bite him?

44
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,442
Six are left.

45
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,528
Who will be voted out tonight?

46
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,169
>> The vote tonight was four

47
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,837
votes for Corinne and three

48
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,588
votes for me.

49
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,214
And I believe that tonight I got

50
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,466
a vote from Kenny, and he wants

51
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,634
me out of the game.

52
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,593
You were voting out Corinne

53
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,761
tonight.

54
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,553
Why did you put down my name?

55
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,554
>> Because they had the immunity

56
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,138
idol.

57
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,681
I thought it was the real one.

58
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,349
>> Don't lie, bro.

59
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,267
That's what you're doing.

60
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,477
>> Once I got back from camp,

61
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,978
Matty was super mad at me.

62
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,313
I voted for him, and that was

63
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,147
strategically a move to gain me

64
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,817
jury votes in the final three.

65
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,567
I<i> have</i> been calling the shots

66
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,569
since day one out here, you

67
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:51,778
know?

68
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,154
I<i> am</i> the mastermind behind

69
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,322
everything going on.

70
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,990
Both of you, just listen to my

71
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,283
story.

72
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,618
>> I started getting an earload

73
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,911
of crap from Kenny, you know,

74
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,496
why he did what he did, and I

75
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,247
didn't even want to hear it from

76
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,248
him, you know?

77
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,290
Don't lie, Kenny.

78
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,543
Kenny's playing a game.

79
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,502
He's a mastermind.

80
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,170
And I'm on to him.

81
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,257
>> Don't worry. Don't worry.

82
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,218
I really like Matty, but he's a

83
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,595
huge physical threat.

84
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,055
I have a strong alliance with

85
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,390
Kenny and Crystal, and that's

86
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,724
the best alliance I've had in

87
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,270
the whole entire game.

88
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,813
>> He's put your name down.

89
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,814
>> Yeah, exactly.

90
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,398
And I still ain't put his name

91
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,190
down yet.

92
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,568
I owe him, and I'm letting both

93
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,360
y'all know, I owe him.

94
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,904
I'm really regretting not

95
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,864
writing Matty's name down

96
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,448
tonight, which is probably the

97
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,534
stupidest move that I've made in

98
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,119
this game so far.

99
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,453
Hopefully, Matty doesn't win

100
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,290
immunity at the next challenge,

101
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,293
and Matty needs to go.

125
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,116

you can head back out.

00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,427

Kenny heading back out.

00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,365
All three guys have hit their

194
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,074
shots.

195
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,617
The women have yet to make one.

196
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,538
>> Damn!

197
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,958
>> PROBST: Matty taking aim.

198
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,210
Just misses.

199
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,837
Kenny now back with his second

200
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,840
ball.

201
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,593
Bob not panicking, not rushing.

202
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,100
Matty drills his second one.

203
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,560
Bob, with one shot, drills his

204
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:02,607
second ball.

205
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,317
Kenny hits his second one.

206
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,734
He's heading out.

207
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,695
It is Matty, Bob, Kenny heading

208
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,739
out for their third and final

209
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,824
ball.

210
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,041
Matty with a big advantage in

211
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,126
time.

212
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,674
Bob now getting in on it.

213
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,844
It is Matty, Bob, and Kenny.

214
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,429
First one to get their ball in

215
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:36,641
the net wins reward.

216
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,561
Kenny just misses.

217
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,941
Matty just misses.

218
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,026
Bob scores!

219
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,736
Bob wins reward!

220
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,197
>> Good going, Bob.

221
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,032
>> Oh, it's all good.

222
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,867
(indistinct chatter)

223
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,618
>> (grunts)

224
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,495
(laughter)

225
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,622
>> PROBST: Bob, come on over.

226
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,582
Your reward is pretty nice.

227
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,252
Do a little gorilla watching,

228
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,462
nice meal, good night's sleep in

229
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,380
a bed.

230
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,423
An adventure like this is always

231
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,133
more fun if you can share it.

232
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,718
Choose one person to go with you

233
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:18,057
on this reward.

234
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,558
Crystal.

235
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,768
>> Oh, thank you!

236
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,727
>> PROBST: Crystal gonna join

237
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,438
Bob for a nice reward.

238
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:24,981
Two's fun; three's a party.

239
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,483
Pick one other person to go with

240
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:27,942
you.

241
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,235
>> Kenny.

242
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,736
>> PROBST: Without hesitating,

243
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,572
Bob chooses Kenny.

244
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,906
>> The way I'm playing the game

245
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,824
right now is, I need Crystal and

246
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,827
Kenny to work with me.

247
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,787
Because I<i> am</i> trying to play for

248
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,706
all the marbles in the pot.

249
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,873
>> PROBST: All right, Bob, one

250
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:43,916
more big decision.

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,501
You have three people left.

252
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,253
One of them is going to Exile

253
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,087
Island.

254
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,629
>> Miss Q can go.

255
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,506
Susie Q.

256
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:51,757
>> PROBST: Susie Q, Exile Island

257
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,758
awaits you.

258
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,510
Grab your stuff.

259
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,094
>> I'm right here.

260
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,137
>> PROBST: You will return in

261
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,221
time for the next immunity

262
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:57,847
challenge.

263
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,181
Straight out this way.

264
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,808
(indistinct talking)

265
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,143
Sugar, Matty, got nothing for

266
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,102
you.

267
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,478
Grab your stuff.

268
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,062
Head back to camp.

269
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,230
>> Bye. Have fun.

270
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,898
>> Bye, guys.

271
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,400
>> Crystal and Kenny drive me

272
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:09,859
nuts.

273
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,693
They've spent way too long in

274
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,528
this game.

275
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,238
My goal with Sugar is to get her

276
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:14,864
to align with me and vote Kenny

277
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,782
and Crystal out.

278
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,868
>> PROBST: Bob, Crystal, Kenny,

279
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,036
helicopter coming in.

280
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,329
Have a great time.

281
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,913
Head on out.

282
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,000
♪ ♪

283
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:42,975
♪ ♪

284
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,810
(trumpets)

285
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,771
>> Oh, my God, this is my first

286
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,856
time in a helicopter, and, yeah,

287
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,191
I was enjoying it.

288
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,068
Looking down you see nothing but

289
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,570
pure jungle and savanna.

290
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,154
It's-it's... it really is Eden

291
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,157
out here.

292
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,291
(speaking in native language)

293
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,251
>> Oh, my God.

294
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,420
>> We walk into this hut and the

295
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,297
first thing, of course, we see

296
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,801
on the table is food.

297
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,011
You have your fresh mango, your

298
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:19,929
fresh watermelon, your salami,

299
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,306
your cheese, your olives, your

300
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,932
tomatoes.

301
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,893
>> Ooh, ooh!

302
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,852
>> These are good.

303
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,354
>> Thank you, guys, for joining

304
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,438
me.

305
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:29,939
>> Thank you.

306
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,773
>> Thank you.

307
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,818
>> Cheers.

308
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:34,735
>> I wish I could have brought

309
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,821
everybody.

310
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,659
>> I think if Matty doesn't win

311
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,911
tomorrow, you know, that would

312
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,286
be a good thing.

313
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,830
>> I hope the next move is

314
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,123
Matty because if it's not

315
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,582
Matty, it's going to be one of

316
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,292
us.

317
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,419
>> Can we get Sugar on board

318
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,129
with that?

319
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,338
It would be nice if we could

320
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,715
take Matty out, and it's nice

321
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,510
that I think I have won the

322
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,887
confidence of Crystal and Kenny.

323
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,222
And I think my integrity has

324
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,932
stepped in here and is working.

325
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,142
Kenny believes I will give him

326
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:06,976
the immunity if I win it, and

327
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,853
the reason he believes me, I

328
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,187
think, is, because I do have

329
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:10,938
integrity.

330
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,398
>> I mean, if you win immunity,

331
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,942
I could take a risk.

332
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,110
You don't have to give it to me

333
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:16,902
the first time.

334
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,156
But...

335
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,323
>> If I don't give it to you

336
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:21,907
the first time, I'm not a man

337
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:22,867
of my word, right?

338
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,035
>> Yeah, that's true.

339
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,830
>> Uh, but if you want to...

340
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,873
You want to analyze and get me

341
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,206
off the hook.

342
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:29,957
Originally, I told you, I would

343
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,875
give it to you right away.

344
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,252
I think the best thing is for

345
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,378
you to make the decision.

346
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,546
>> Yeah, and I'll be like,

347
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,173
"I think you should keep it

348
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,174
tonight, Bob."

349
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,259
Or I'll say, "I think that I'm

350
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,677
in danger."

351
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,721
>> This is the plan: at the

352
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,681
next Tribal, I'll be wearing

353
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,683
the necklace I haven't won yet,

354
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,893
and if Kenny feels that he

355
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,854
needs it, and if he wants it,

356
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,313
I will give it to him.

357
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,315
If he thinks it's better off

358
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,442
protecting me, he'll say,

359
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,526
"No, keep it."

360
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,069
>> I think all of us look so

361
00:12:59,153 --> 00:12:59,987
dirty.

362
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,988
I hope they're going to let us

363
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,781
take a shower and get cleaned

364
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,866
up before we go.

365
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,283
>> See the gorillas?

366
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,495
>> Mmm.

367
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,705
>> I'm so excited.

368
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,915
To take a shower was

369
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:11,874
invigorating.

370
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,959
We had soap and towels and

371
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,002
washcloths.

372
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,379
And put on some fresh clothes,

373
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,089
and we were just like, "Wow,

374
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,382
you smell so good."

375
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,551
>> Oh, man!

376
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,220
>> It was pretty cool.

377
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,012
>> Wow, Bob.

378
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:25,888
>> A big improvement.

379
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,056
>> I know.

380
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,640
>> The green does kind of look

381
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,807
good on you, too.

382
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,975
>> It does.

383
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,729
>> It's even got pockets.

384
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,188
>> Hey, guys.

385
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:34,396
>> Hi.

386
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,022
>> Welcome to Mbenge, the

387
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,609
Gorilla Project.

388
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,235
>> Nice to meet you.

389
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:39,485
I'm Bob.

390
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,569
>> Nice to meet you.

391
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,570
>> Nice to meet you.

392
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,112
>> After we cleaned up, some

393
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,072
rangers came in and spoke to us

394
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,533
about the Gorilla Project.

395
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,951
It's called Africa's Eden.

396
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,786
>> So, we're a sanctuary and

397
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,162
a rehabilitation center.

398
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,043
>> So, the rangers explained

399
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,002
everything about gorillas.

400
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:57,962
They said they were really in

401
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:58,921
danger because of people

402
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,549
poaching them in Africa, getting

403
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,925
gorilla meat, and what's left

404
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,885
is baby orphaned gorillas, and

405
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,971
they have nowhere to go.

406
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:10,891
>> We walked down to an

407
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,936
observation platform, and we

408
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,895
sat there for quite some time,

409
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,189
just sort of getting them used

410
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,275
to us.

411
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,036
And then Mbakai, the large

412
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,789
silverback gorilla, stepped out.

413
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,045
His head is enormous.

414
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,046
We were 25 feet from him.

415
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,842
He was right there.

416
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm not usually spiritual, but

417
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,597
there was a feeling like there

418
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,098
was a connection between these

419
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:55,436
great apes and myself, how they

420
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,895
were looking at us, and we were

421
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:57,980
looking at them.

422
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,064
And it just...

423
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,233
It did sort of rock my soul.

424
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,008
>> Coming to Exile, I know that

425
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,053
Sugar has the idol, so I went

426
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,262
ahead and took my chances and

427
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,639
just enjoyed the comfort and the

428
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,306
fruit just to get away from the

429
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,391
whole game.

430
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,104
People back at Nobag have

431
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,524
no idea what they're missing.

432
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,984
It was pretty easy choosing the

433
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,527
comfort, actually.

434
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,529
But the one great thing about

435
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,822
being at Exile is it takes you

436
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,199
away from the game.

437
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,825
You can just step away and say,

438
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,701
"I don't have to think about

439
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,952
anything right now."

440
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:54,828
I think I'm going to have to

441
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,747
change it from "Sugar Shack" to

442
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,541
"Susie Shack."

443
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,849
>> Well, we went on a cool

444
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,475
reward and they didn't get to do

445
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,059
anything.

446
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,102
>> I've been gunning for

447
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,229
Crystal and Kenny this entire

448
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:20,979
game.

449
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:21,897
>> Really?

450
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,272
>> Yeah, really.

451
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,817
>> Well, I'll tell you what.

452
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,734
You better win that thing

453
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,027
tomorrow because you're the

454
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:27,444
biggest threat now.

455
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,863
I wouldn't want to be Matty

456
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,406
right now because he knows

457
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,865
he's next.

458
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,408
If it's not Bob, who is it?

459
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,953
In my alliance with Kenny and

460
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:36,245
Crystal...

461
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,079
>> It is your alliance.

462
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:37,913
>> It's me and Kenny and

463
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:38,997
Crystal.

464
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:39,998
>> So now you're choosing them

465
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:40,416
as your alliance?

466
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,334
Brilliant thinking.

467
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,794
You're the evil three.

468
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,628
>> We're not the evil three,

469
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:44,837
dude.

470
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,796
>> I don't know, man.

471
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,005
>> It's mostly with me and

472
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:47,423
Kenny.

473
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,924
Unless, you know, he could

474
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:49,591
totally be taking me for a ride.

475
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,301
>> He is taking you for a ride

476
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,177
because his main alliance is

477
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,011
Crystal.

478
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:53,429
I know for 1,000%.

479
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,138
>> I'm sure Kenny is probably

480
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,558
lying to me, but Matty is the

481
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,476
stronger physical threat, so

482
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,894
I don't know who to believe.

483
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,938
I don't know who to turn to.

484
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,273
I'm pretty sure you and Bob

485
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:04,523
will win.

486
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,233
>> Well, you have the idol.

487
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,197
>> Nobody's going to vote for

488
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,073
you.

489
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,533
>> We'll see.

490
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,244
>> Not with having the idol.

491
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,370
>> Oh, Matty.

492
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,455
I'm certainly not going to

493
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,873
give Matty my idol.

494
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:21,248
Screw that.

495
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,291
At this point, I'm using my

496
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,333
idol to make sure I'm in the

497
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,418
final five.

498
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,169
>> If Bob takes the next

499
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:25,753
immunity challenge, they're

500
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,004
voting for me.

501
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,213
>> I would say that's accurate.

502
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,507
>> My status now is I'm

503
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,800
basically on my own.

504
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,801
And I'm not getting any help

505
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,553
from anybody, and if I don't win

506
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,512
the next immunity challenge,

507
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,930
I think I'm packing up my bags

508
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,266
and going home.

509
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,496
>> Yay!

510
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,705
Was it the best ever?

511
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,456
>> Yes.

512
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,499
>> All right, tell us about it.

513
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,333
>> Look at this.

514
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,584
>> Your shirt is clean?

515
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,502
>> Yes.

516
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,169
>> Oh, my God.

517
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,170
Let me wear it.

518
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,505
>> This is...

519
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,881
The green is a lot.

520
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:11,882
>> It's cool that Bob went on

521
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,383
the experience, but he chose

522
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,676
Kenny and Crystal, which was

523
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,136
so annoying and frustrating to

524
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,223
me because those two just...

525
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,265
I don't know.

526
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:20,849
I'm having a hard time with

527
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,477
those two still.

528
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,770
>> I can feel it, Matty, that

529
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,604
you're, like, mad at me.

530
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,396
So, I don't know why you're

531
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,147
trying to hide it.

532
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,398
>> I never voted for you.

533
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,233
You said we were going to the

534
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,317
end together, Kenny.

535
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,859
>> There's no reason to be

536
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,985
upset.

537
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:32,861
>> I have good reason.

538
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,612
My name was written down three

539
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:33,904
times here.

540
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,030
>> My name's been written down

541
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,782
eight, one of them by you.

542
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,991
You still, to this day, say

543
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:38,534
"Crystal, thank you for not

544
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,952
writing my name down."

545
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:40,786
>> My name has been written

546
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,412
down seven times already.

547
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,247
>> I don't care.

548
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,373
>> Think about that.

549
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,457
>> Hey, Kenny, don't talk about

550
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,708
it anymore, okay, bro?

551
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,168
>> No, I'm mad.

552
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,754
Matty is super paranoid.

553
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,672
Ever since his name was written

554
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:51,880
down.

555
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,423
It was a strategic move on my

556
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:53,715
part, but...

557
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,134
It's a game.

558
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,093
People write down names.

559
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:56,552
>> Let him be scared.

560
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,887
Karma's a bitch in this game.

561
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,513
Right now I'm throwing the stink

562
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,348
on Matty, so everybody else can

563
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,599
smell it and write his name

564
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,643
down.

565
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,860
>> Mm-hmm.

566
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:15,696
>> Because you and Sue are like

567
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,322
that.

568
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,740
>> I am like that with Sue.

569
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,741
I like Sue.

570
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,868
I like spending time with Sue

571
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,326
out here.

572
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:21,743
I don't trust her.

573
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,495
>> You can look me in the eye

574
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,496
and say you don't trust Sue.

575
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:24,955
>> I don't trust Sue.

576
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,957
>> You're lying.

577
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,249
>> What?

578
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,751
>> You've changed, and it's not

579
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,460
for the good.

580
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,336
But if you (blip) me and Kenny

581
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,087
over, karma is a bitch.

582
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:32,713
>> Why are you getting mad at

583
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:32,880
me?

584
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,881
I didn't do anything.

585
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,464
>> Because me and Kenny have

586
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,465
been there for you from day

587
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,049
one.

588
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:36,550
>> What do you mean?

589
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,676
What do you want from me?

590
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,635
>> I don't want anything from

591
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:38,802
you.

592
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,679
I don't want anything from you.

593
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,764
>> I have no idea what's

594
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,640
happening right now.

595
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,350
Crystal is going off on Matty

596
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,310
for no reason, and I've already

597
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,687
seen Kenny go off on Matty, and

598
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,188
Matty doesn't deserve to be

599
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,650
yelled at.

600
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,651
>> What am I doing wrong,

601
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:54,902
Crystal?

602
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,278
>> Keep doing what you're doing.

603
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,779
But where did this come from?

604
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,197
>> Matty is right, I think,

605
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,407
that Crystal and Kenny have

606
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,700
been in this together from the

607
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,993
beginning and they just take

608
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,952
out whoever they want.

609
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,704
Kenny acts like he's this weak,

610
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,040
little meager guy, and he spins

611
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,417
all these lies, and Crystal is

612
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,335
just a big bully.

613
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,795
This is the thing.

614
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,922
They're not good people.

615
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,757
I'm starting to see that about

616
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,966
Kenny, and I know that about

617
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,383
Crystal.

618
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,304
>> Do you really, or you just...

619
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,263
I don't know what's going on.

620
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,390
>> I don't, either, but now I

621
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,808
see that they're not, like...

622
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,143
Why would they kick you when

623
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:28,894
you're down?

624
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,978
It feels like they're just

625
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,939
going off on you when you know

626
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,606
you're going.

627
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,316
But you're not going.

628
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,276
>> Why don't I just...

629
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,362
>> You're not going to go.

630
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,908
Okay?

631
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,034
>> Well, what do we do?

632
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,036
>> You, me, Bob, and Sue.

633
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,663
I have to talk to Bob because

634
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,455
I know Bob better than anybody

635
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,331
else.

636
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,291
At this point.

637
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,960
>> Sugar, are you truthful?

638
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,044
>> I am not...

639
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,671
>> If Sugar really is telling

640
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,591
me the truth, I have hope, and I

641
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,050
could play this game.

642
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:00,676
I might have to go to the end

643
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,426
with Bob, and Bob will

644
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,346
dominate, but least good will

645
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:04,596
prevail.

646
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,223
>> It's either me and you

647
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,015
guys or you guys and Sue.

648
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:07,599
>> Who do we take out first,

649
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,475
then, if you're being serious?

650
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:08,767
>> Crystal.

651
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,477
Crystal goes first.

652
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,813
>> This is just intense.

653
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm just praying that I can

654
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,734
find the strength to...

655
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,820
finish.

656
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:42,718
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

657
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,385
We'll now bring in Susie,

658
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,471
returning from Exile Island.

659
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,434
>> It was a good time.

660
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:50,892
It was a good time.

661
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,476
>> PROBST: Welcome back.

662
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,978
>> Thank you.

663
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:53,562
>> PROBST: You guys ready to

664
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,354
get to today's immunity

665
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,022
challenge?

666
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:55,230
>> Yes.

667
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,106
>> PROBST: First things first.

668
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:56,648
Bob, I will take back the

669
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,818
necklace.

670
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,447
Thank you.

671
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,907
Once again, immunity is back up

672
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,783
for grabs.

673
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,078
For today's challenge, on my

674
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,329
"go," you will study the

675
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,414
features of a Gabonese mask.

676
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,541
You will then grab a bag of mask

677
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,002
pieces and make your way

678
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,336
through a series of obstacles

679
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:18,920
to a station where you will

680
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,174
find a second blank mask.

681
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,800
You will then use those pieces

682
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,677
to fill in the missing features.

683
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,263
One more thing: you will be

684
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,599
blindfolded.

685
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,225
First person to collect all

686
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,894
three bags and successfully

687
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,104
recreate the mask wins

688
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,690
immunity-- guaranteed a one in

689
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,649
what, Kenny?

690
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,401
>> One in five chance of

691
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,652
winning a million dollars.

692
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,653
>> PROBST: There you go.

693
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,489
Losers, Tribal Council, where

694
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,240
somebody will be voted out of

695
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,116
this game.

696
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,076
Worth playing for?

697
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:49,618
>> Yes.

698
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,829
All right, we'll get started.

699
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,708
Here we go.

700
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,294
Other side, Sugar, other side.

701
00:22:59,377 --> 00:22:59,628
Here we go.

702
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,254
For immunity.

703
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,423
Survivors ready?

704
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,260
Go!

705
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,221
You will use your hands to study

706
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,555
that mask.

707
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,307
Or, if you decide to, you can

708
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,350
head out right away.

709
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,353
It is up to you.

710
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,028
Matty quickly out to a lead.

711
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,743
Matty at his station first, got

712
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,120
his first bag, and he's heading

713
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:33,912
back.

714
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:34,538
Not going to work on it one bag

715
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,414
at a time.

716
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,541
Kenny back with his first bag

717
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,000
of pieces.

718
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,877
Bob is back.

719
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,754
Sugar, Bob, Kenny are all going

720
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,423
to start working on recreating

721
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,507
the mask.

722
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,175
Matty's going to go get all of

723
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,512
his pieces at once.

724
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,346
Crystal.

725
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:51,721
>> Yes?

726
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,514
>> PROBST: You are off the

727
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:52,973
course.

728
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:53,306
>> Oh, shoot.

729
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,932
>> PROBST: You are in the wrong

730
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:54,891
lane.

731
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,643
You're completely off track.

732
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,853
You got to get back on the

733
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,773
course and find your lane.

734
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,233
Matty coming back with his

735
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,901
second bag of pieces, while

736
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,612
Kenny, Bob, Sugar, and Susie

737
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,197
start working with their first

738
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,575
bag of facial features.

739
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,410
Crystal, up over a hitching

740
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,537
post, heading the right way.

741
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,748
In the wrong lane.

742
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,083
Matty heading back for his

743
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,835
third and final bag.

744
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,211
Bob is heading back, looking

745
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,213
for his second bag.

746
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:25,714
Crystal once again off the

747
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,757
course.

748
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,593
Crystal back on the course.

749
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,219
Matty coming back with that

750
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:31,845
third bag.

751
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,514
Everybody else so close and

752
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,850
yet so far away when you cannot

753
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:37,559
see.

754
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,477
Matty now back with all three

755
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,562
bags of the facial features.

756
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,563
Matty now going to start

757
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,232
working on his mask.

758
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,525
Kenny heading back now, looking

759
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,860
for that second bag.

760
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,821
Bob is back with his second bag.

761
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,572
Crystal, miraculously, is

762
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,617
almost there.

763
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,285
Crystal has arrived with her

764
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,537
first bag.

765
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,789
Kenny takes a header into a

766
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,749
pole.

767
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,125
Even the king can get injured

768
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,419
in this challenge.

769
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,921
Everybody working on their mask

770
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,631
now.

771
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,050
Bob now heading back for his

772
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,509
third and final bag.

773
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,636
Susie heading back for her

774
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,639
second bag.

775
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,640
(Bob groans, chuckles)

776
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,017
Bob took a header into a

777
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,726
station.

778
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,772
Susie is off the course.

779
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,106
Bob heading back with that

780
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,109
third and final bag.

781
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,659
Matty going to head back to

782
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,161
check his mask again, while Bob

783
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:38,787
is back with that third and

784
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,290
final bag.

785
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,504
>> I think I have it.

786
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,839
>> PROBST: Bob thinks he has it.

787
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,011
Bob does not have it.

788
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:55,595
Matty now coming back after

789
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,266
checking that mask.

790
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,309
Bob making a lot of changes.

791
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,144
Kenny still working on his mask.

792
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:03,603
He has all three bags.

793
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,648
The question now is, "Do I have

794
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,942
the right pieces?"

795
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:09,651
Crystal not giving up,

796
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,945
continues to fight in this

797
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,238
challenge.

798
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,698
Susie trying to find the course.

799
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,246
>> I think I have it, Jeff.

800
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,330
>> PROBST: Kenny thinks he has

801
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,124
it.

802
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,750
Kenny is wrong.

803
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,085
Kenny going to head back to

804
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,753
check his mask again.

805
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,838
Matty very close.

806
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,424
Bob is almost there.

807
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,134
Big immunity on the line.

808
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:37,846
>> I'll just try that.

809
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,639
>> PROBST: Bob thinks he has it.

810
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,851
Bob is right!

811
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,020
Bob wins immunity!

812
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:45,937
Four straight challenges.

813
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,944
>> Wow.

814
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,863
>> PROBST: Bob, come on over.

815
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,449
Once again, immunity is yours.

816
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,825
Turn around, brother.

817
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,202
Once again, Bob is safe at

818
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:01,703
Tribal Council.

819
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,623
After 36 long days, Tribal

820
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,416
Council tonight.

821
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,709
One of you will be going home.

822
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,043
Grab your stuff.

823
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,377
Head back to camp.

824
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,129
I will see you at Tribal.

825
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,630
>> Four challenges in a row.

826
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,965
I'm 57 years old.

827
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,091
It felt real good.

828
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,259
Been a good run at four.

829
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,928
I never would have guessed that.

830
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,388
>> Bob promised me that if he

831
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:20,972
won the immunity necklace that

832
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,640
he'll give it to me.

833
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,808
Now, it's up to Bob, you know.

834
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,101
Actions do speak louder than

835
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:25,727
words, and I can only wait to

836
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,064
see what he does tonight.

837
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,337
>> I know you want to get rid

838
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,421
of Matty.

839
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,632
But we get rid of Matty tonight,

840
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,384
there's a chance Bob lied to me

841
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,426
and won't give me the necklace

842
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:58,968
next time.

843
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,303
So I'm going to tell Bob to

844
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,429
give me the necklace tonight.

845
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:01,971
And we got to vote for Bob.

846
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:02,847
>> Okay, sounds good.

847
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,765
>> Is that okay?

848
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,642
>> I'm cool with that.

849
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,601
>> Who would've thought Bob

850
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,102
would be winning all these

851
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:07,977
challenges?

852
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:08,353
But he has been.

853
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,771
We should have got rid of him

854
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,939
when we had the chance, but we

855
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,065
kept him in because everybody

856
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:12,816
hated Randy.

857
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,734
And now we're paying for it.

858
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,944
He's too dangerous at this

859
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,778
point.

860
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,946
None of us has the chance to

861
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,280
make it to the final three.

862
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,365
>> Okay.

863
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,574
In all honesty, I would like

864
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,701
to take out Matty, but if it's

865
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,285
Bob's name we're going with

866
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:24,911
tonight, Bob it is.

867
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,746
As long as it's not Crystal,

868
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,873
I'm fine.

869
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,798
>> Hmm?

870
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,842
Why?

871
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,927
Why would you be scared?

872
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,928
>> I don't know.

873
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,179
Bob made a deal with me, you

874
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:43,638
know.

875
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,639
He's going to give me that

876
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:45,598
immunity necklace if he wins.

877
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,766
If he doesn't, he'll look

878
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,767
really bad in front of

879
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,435
everybody.

880
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,145
If he does, he'll look good in

881
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,229
front of everybody, and he'll go

882
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:51,438
home.

883
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,566
So lose-lose situation for him.

884
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,861
>> Why would they blindside you?

885
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,904
We're going to take Matty out.

886
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,326
Why would you feel nervous?

887
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,911
>> 'Cause I'm with you.

888
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,746
There might be the four still.

889
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,622
>> Okay, okay.

890
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,915
We'll talk... we'll talk.

891
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,708
We'll talk about it.

892
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,292
Let's find out who's voting

893
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:12,876
for who?

894
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,807
>> What?

895
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,526
>> Hey, guys.

896
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:49,913
>> Kenny has come up with this

897
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,249
elaborate plan to hoax Bob out

898
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,209
of his necklace.

899
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,627
If Bob were to give Kenny the

900
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,753
necklace, then everybody would

901
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,962
vote for Bob because they want

902
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:58,922
to keep their five alliance.

903
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,007
I don't want to be aligned with

904
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,758
all those guys.

905
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,383
I want to be aligned with the

906
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,135
good guys.

907
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,183
Crystal and Kenny, I've been,

908
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,017
like, in an alliance with them.

909
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,393
>> Mm-hmm.

910
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,729
>> But just something, something

911
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,648
is really striking me weird

912
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,108
right now that, that I didn't

913
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,527
feel before.

914
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,446
And, um, they told me that if

915
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,448
you give Kenny the, uh, the

916
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,824
necklace, then he's going to...

917
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,909
they're going to blindside you.

918
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,245
That's the plan.

919
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,079
And, uh, see, I wouldn't know

920
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,248
that unless they told me that.

921
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,876
So... I think that you shouldn't

922
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,879
do everything that they say.

923
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,257
I think we need to take them

924
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,008
out.

925
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,469
I mean, I just wanted to talk

926
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,178
to you about it.

927
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,221
You don't have to make any

928
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:48,471
decisions.

929
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,889
You can vote for whoever you

930
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:50,348
want.

931
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,432
>> So where's Susie stand in

932
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:51,933
all this?

933
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,561
>> I-I really don't know what

934
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,353
Susie's doing.

935
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,729
I'm sure she's going to vote

936
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,189
for whoever Matty votes for.

937
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,483
And I think we should vote for

938
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,027
Crystal.

939
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,487
>> Sugar said to me that it was

940
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,531
a blindside coming, which is an

941
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,740
interesting thing because she

942
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,992
hasn't done anything to show me

943
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:09,867
I can trust her.

944
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,160
She has not done anything that

945
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,996
shows me I can't trust her.

946
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,416
So I want to believe, but she's,

947
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,210
um, she-she's playing the game.

948
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,259
>> I appreciate that.

949
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,886
Um...

950
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,471
>> I mean, it's-it's a big

951
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,514
decision for you, and I

952
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,098
understand that.

953
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,516
But I just want you to look out

954
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,102
for yourself.

955
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,104
I will not vote for you.

956
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,063
I know you're the biggest

957
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,149
threat, but I don't care.

958
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,233
I just think the good guys

959
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,235
should win in the end.

960
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,366
>> What are we going to do if

961
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,035
he doesn't give me the idol?

962
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:56,914
>> I'm going home, obviously.

963
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,418
>> Hmm?

964
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,127
>> I think he might do it.

965
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,795
>> Why? What happened?

966
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,379
>> I just talked to him for a

967
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,007
little bit, and I was like...

968
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,050
I hate lying to Bob because I

969
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,092
really, really like Bob.

970
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,927
But it is a game.

971
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,012
I just told him that Kenny's

972
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,347
next.

973
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,349
I think. We'll see.

974
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,815
>> Bob thinks that I'm on the

975
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,108
outskirts with him, and, um,

976
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,777
I've made him think that.

977
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,402
Hopefully, he will give me that

978
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,071
immunity necklace, and Bob goes

979
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,364
home tonight.

980
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,948
But if not, then Matty will be

981
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,076
going home instead.

982
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,121
>> Yeah.

983
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:06,442
>> I'm definitely playing my

984
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,778
idol at Tribal because it's my

985
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,237
last day to do it.

986
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,531
Maybe I should give it to Matty

987
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,366
and save Matty, but I don't

988
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,660
want anybody to blindside me.

989
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,078
Just as long as Matty listens

990
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,914
to me, and Bob knows to trust

991
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:20,456
me, everything's going to be

992
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,292
fine.

993
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,102
>> PROBST: Now bring in

994
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,355
the members of our jury.

995
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,151
Marcus, Charlie, Randy...

996
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,740
and Corinne, voted out at the

997
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,784
last Tribal Council.

998
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,327
So, Bob, let's start with you.

999
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,706
Four challenges in a row.

1000
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,374
There's no hiding; you're a

1001
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,960
legitimate threat in this game.

1002
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:06,502
>> You hit the nail right on

1003
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,879
the head.

1004
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,505
It's a huge target on my back.

1005
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,799
And if I don't win, I could be

1006
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,843
joining the jury.

1007
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,761
>> PROBST: Kenny, you start

1008
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,344
seeing a guy like Bob bring it

1009
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,639
on strong, he could win his way

1010
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,141
to the final Tribal Council.

1011
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,142
>> Yeah, he amazes me, you

1012
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,186
know, for being as old as he is.

1013
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,228
He's strong.

1014
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,229
He's smart.

1015
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,398
He's agile.

1016
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,274
He's, he's Bob.

1017
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,193
>> PROBST: Matty, when you see

1018
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,694
Bob win challenge after

1019
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,279
challenge, what starts going

1020
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,530
through your head?

1021
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,782
>> You know, if anybody is

1022
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,366
going to dominate at this game,

1023
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,284
I'm really happy that it's this

1024
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,870
man next to me, Bob, because

1025
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,455
it's a lot better him having

1026
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,831
that necklace around his neck

1027
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,292
than somebody of a little less

1028
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,460
caliber.

1029
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,045
>> PROBST: Susie, a lot going

1030
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,421
on these last few days.

1031
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,089
Hard to be away on Exile?

1032
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:52,673
>> Yeah, when you're away like

1033
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,592
that and you come back into the

1034
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,343
game, it's like, wow.

1035
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,929
You just miss bits and pieces.

1036
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,305
And then I have to rely on my

1037
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,431
own gut instincts, so...

1038
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,392
Even now, I'm still not certain.

1039
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,685
>> PROBST: Kenny, with only six

1040
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,020
people left, why do you think

1041
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,605
Bob chose you as one of the

1042
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,981
people to go on the gorilla

1043
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,024
reward?

1044
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:11,859
>> Um, basically, at the last

1045
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,153
Tribal Council, uh, I-I flopped.

1046
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,907
I believed in Bob, and once I

1047
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,491
got back to camp, everybody

1048
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,618
noticed that I was the one who

1049
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,285
flopped.

1050
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,370
And I was very frustrated, and I

1051
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,413
asked him, "Why did you lie to

1052
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:24,705
me, Bob?"

1053
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,373
And Bob promised me something.

1054
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,792
He-he told me that he would try

1055
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,835
his best to win the next

1056
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,503
immunity challenge, and he would

1057
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,254
give me the immunity necklace if

1058
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,256
he did win it.

1059
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,007
>> PROBST: Bob, is that true?

1060
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:35,550
>> That's-that's what I told

1061
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,968
him.

1062
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,177
Uh, we have since then sort of

1063
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,763
renegotiated things.

1064
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,640
Uh, I told him that if I feel

1065
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,307
that he is going to go home

1066
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,184
tonight, that I'd give him

1067
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,727
the necklace.

1068
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,312
And after we discuss all this,

1069
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,689
I'll make that decision.

1070
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,648
>> PROBST: And, Kenny, you're

1071
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,732
making the case tonight that

1072
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,859
you feel you're in danger.

1073
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:53,359
>> I was at such a great

1074
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,319
position, and now I'm on the

1075
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,237
outcast.

1076
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,405
You know, I turned on my

1077
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,115
alliance.

1078
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,200
Bob has the necklace, and where

1079
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,910
am I?

1080
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,078
>> PROBST: Crystal, got to make

1081
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:04,620
you feel a little good that

1082
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,915
Bob, who clearly has some power

1083
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,417
in this game, picked you as one

1084
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,960
of the people to go on a big

1085
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,711
reward.

1086
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,630
>> Um, I feel that he chose me

1087
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,965
because I haven't been on a

1088
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,758
reward in the 36 days that

1089
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,843
we've been here.

1090
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,720
And I feel honored to at least

1091
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,179
get some kind of culture from

1092
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,056
being here in Africa.

1093
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,974
>> PROBST: Matty, do you think

1094
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,225
that's all it was... Bob just

1095
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:26,767
wanted somebody to have a

1096
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,186
cultural experience, nothing to

1097
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,438
do with an opportunity to bond

1098
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,648
with two people who could help

1099
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,399
you get further in the game?

1100
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,234
>> I believe Bob knows that

1101
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,444
Kenny and Crystal are the

1102
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,030
tightest alliance since day one

1103
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:39,614
in this game, and they have

1104
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,450
honestly dominated this game.

1105
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,242
>> PROBST: Kenny, you're

1106
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:43,618
shaking your head.

1107
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,244
>> I think that everybody

1108
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,412
thinks that me and Crystal are

1109
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,331
very tight, but I jumped from

1110
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,916
my really good position in the

1111
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,250
five alliance that I had, and I

1112
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,878
feel like I could be the next

1113
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:54,879
to go.

1114
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:55,880
>> PROBST: So, based on what

1115
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,298
you're saying then, how much

1116
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,424
more important is the deal you

1117
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,676
may or may not have made with

1118
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,886
Bob tonight?

1119
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,304
>> It makes the deal even more

1120
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,348
important to me because I've

1121
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,474
had a feeling all day that it

1122
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,310
might be me.

1123
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,062
>> PROBST: Matty, how you

1124
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:11,437
feeling tonight?

1125
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,773
>> Uh, very vulnerable.

1126
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,315
And, uh, I don't have that

1127
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,734
necklace on me, so that puts me

1128
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,778
on the chopping block next.

1129
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,737
>> PROBST: Let's talk about the

1130
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,322
hidden immunity idol.

1131
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,490
I just want to remind everybody

1132
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,493
that tonight is the last night

1133
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,911
you can play...

1134
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,329
>> The hidden immunity idol?

1135
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,248
(Sugar laughs)

1136
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,040
>> PROBST: You're claiming

1137
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,458
that's a hidden immunity idol?

1138
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,459
>> Oh, yeah.

1139
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,627
>> PROBST: I guess if you play

1140
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,878
it, we'll find out that if it

1141
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:36,295
is.

1142
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:36,837
Wouldn't be the first time

1143
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,048
somebody's played an idol that

1144
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,049
wasn't the idol.

1145
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,425
(Sugar laughs)

1146
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,677
>> I didn't make that one.

1147
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,430
(Bob chuckles)

1148
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,640
>> PROBST: Bob, it's time to

1149
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,307
vote.

1150
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,017
You have the individual

1151
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:50,393
immunity necklace.

1152
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,520
You can keep it for yourself.

1153
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,646
You can give it to somebody

1154
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,772
else, including Kenny, if you

1155
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,314
want to.

1156
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,649
It is up to you.

1157
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,441
>> I told Kenny if I thought he

1158
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,236
was going home tonight, I would

1159
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:00,611
give it to him.

1160
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,280
And...

1161
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,994
I'm going to keep it because

1162
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,203
I don't think he's going home

1163
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,330
tonight.

1164
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,627
>> PROBST: All right, so, you

1165
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,962
cannot vote for Bob.

1166
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,006
Everybody else is fair game.

1167
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,340
It is time to vote.

1168
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,592
Crystal, you're up.

1169
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,645
>> You were once part of my

1170
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,604
alliance.

1171
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,315
You wrote my name down one

1172
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,691
time, and it's time for me to

1173
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,443
pay you back.

1174
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,868
>> Crystal, I've been waiting

1175
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:49,577
for this day for a long time,

1176
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,829
and I'm very happy that it's

1177
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,622
finally arrived.

1178
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,426
>> Dude, you don't know how to

1179
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,344
talk or deal with people.

1180
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,221
So, good luck with that jury

1181
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,307
over there.

1182
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,944
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1183
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,030
votes.

1184
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,627
>> If anybody has the hidden

1185
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,836
immunity idol and you want to

1186
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,587
play it, now would be the time

1187
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,132
to do so.

1188
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,121
>> PROBST: Thank you.

1189
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,375
The rules of<i> Survivor</i> state that

1190
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,417
if somebody plays a hidden

1191
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,752
immunity idol, then any votes

1192
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,420
cast against that person will

1193
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:23,754
not count.

1194
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,672
The person with the next

1195
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,006
highest number of votes will be

1196
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,091
voted out.

1197
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,676
This is indeed the hidden

1198
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,178
immunity idol.

1199
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,972
Any votes cast for Matty will

1200
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,767
not count.

1201
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,062
I'll now read the votes.

1202
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,484
First vote: Matty.

1203
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,528
Does not count.

1204
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:51,949
Matty.

1205
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,910
Does not count.

1206
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,372
Next vote: Crystal.

1207
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:01,208
One vote for Crystal.

1208
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,254
Crystal.

1209
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,631
Two votes Crystal.

1210
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,431
13th person voted out and the

1211
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,557
fifth member of our jury:

1212
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,266
Crystal.

1213
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,142
That's three votes.

1214
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:18,559
That's enough.

1215
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,395
Need to bring me your torch.

1216
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,280
Crystal, the tribe has spoken.

1217
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,163
Time for you to go.

1218
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,423
>> PROBST: Well, we are down to

1219
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,341
five.

1220
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,509
The million dollars is within

1221
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,719
sight.

1222
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,512
The question is, which one of

1223
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,681
the five of you will win it.

1224
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,807
Grab your stuff.

1225
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,225
Head back to camp.

1226
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,061
Good night.

in a season filled with

1237

blindsides, fake idols...

1238

1242
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:29,797
>> PROBST: ...and more

1243
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,548
surprises than ever before.

1244
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,050
>> New tribes.

1245
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:33,759
>> PROBST: Find out in a special

1246
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:36,512
two-hour season finale, where

1247
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,305
one of these five people will

1248
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,933
become the sole<i> Survivor.</i>

1249
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,480
>> Wow.

1250
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:48,524
I did not know that Sugar

1251
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,567
turned on me.

1252
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,609
I don't know what for.

1253
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,819
It kind of hurts with three

1254
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,695
days left in the game, but when

1255
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,863
I yelled at Matty, I don't think

1256
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:55,155
it helped.

1257
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,824
It's been a great run, 36 days.

1258
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,493
Tried to play a fair game, and

1259
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:00,619
hopefully I made my friends and

1260
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,704
family proud.
