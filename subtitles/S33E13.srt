1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Previously on Survivor.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Zeke's Alliance had a numbers advantage.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is my five.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Over David's coalition.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The five is just going to pick us off one by one.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But Will was ready to graduate from high school student to power player.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Zeke needs to go. Tonight's the night.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I came here to play.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
At Tribal Council, Adam played his idol.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm playing this for Hannah.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But his move proved unnecessary when Will flipped to David's side.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Zeke, the tribe has spoken.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Leaving Jay with the only idol left in the game.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're playing great moves, Will.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I came into this game a kid, and I feel like I'm leaving this tribal the man.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Filled up your resume, young man.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I opened up every door possible for me.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Everybody needs me in this game.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I believe I can start flip-flopping back and forth enough times to win this game.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Making big moves, huh?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's what it is. Everyone's going to attack at big moves.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How about get to the three? It's a million dollar prize.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Get to the last three. Why would you vote Zeke before David?

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, I don't know.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm used to tribal council not going my way, and again it didn't go my way.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Will flipped and voted out Zeke.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He said, you know, I want to make some big moves in this game.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to check it off in my checklist.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm like, this kid wants everyone to think he's not just a high school kid,

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
but he's thinking like a high school kid.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, I got to do all my homework. I got to check off all these boxes.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Give me a break.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They're all insane.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is getting to be a crazy game, and there's a lot of people really playing it.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So there's got to be a way for me to stay alive in this game.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Listen, Zeke was a huge threat. You don't think we knew that?

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We just knew it was a threat that was on our side.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Right.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now there's a couple more threats left in this game.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Jay, I'm talking about Will, I'm talking about Dave.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Dave. Dave's a huge threat.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If those three people make it to the final three and not win it,

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I might as well go back and eat cake right now.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Brett and Sunday come up to me this morning,

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and they say Dave, Jay, and Will are the three biggest threats in the game.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Those three need to be the next to go, and it's music to my ears.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The question is, who do you take out first?

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know. Who's more important to take out?

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't know.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Us three are very equal. We could go five and get to the end.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If they want to put themselves in a position where they're left with myself,

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hannah and Ken, I love that.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You have our vote.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Those two got to go.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Are we going over?

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Those have to be the next three.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All right. Deal.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Deal.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's go.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Come on in, guys.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This looks involved.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right. Shall we get to today's immunity challenge?

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
First things first, Adam.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Got to take it back.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yep. You can grab it. I'm not going to give it up.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Fair enough.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
For today's challenge, you're going to race out to a group of disks.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You'll stack them and then transport them over a balance beam and through a wire maze.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Once you have all 10 disks out to finish, you'll attempt to roll them into a target.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
First to finish wins immunity.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Safe from the vote.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Guaranteed a one in seven shot.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You'll be the sixth member of the jury.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You'll be the second person to win this game.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Losers, tribal council, somebody will become the sixth member of our jury.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We're going to draw for spots.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We'll get started.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
All right. Here we go.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
For immunity.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Survivors ready?

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Go!

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Start that pull.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Start stacking your disks.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can take one or 10.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The fewer trips, the better.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But if you drop, you got to come back and start again.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Brett quickly out of the gate.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
David heading out.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Everybody heading out now.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sunday immediately drops and got to come back.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now you've got to get across the balance beam.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Takes a lot of coordination to balance on a beam, carrying that stack.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
David quickly over the balance beam.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Brett is over the balance beam.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He's going to drop and head back for more.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ken is over the balance beam.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Jay is clear.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Will drops. He's got to go back.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Add him back with his first four.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Sunday and Hannah moving slowly.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's now David, Ken, Brett and Jay all with their remaining disks.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
David whipping over that beam quickly.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Brett falls off.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He's got to go all the way back.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
David is back.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ken drops. He's good.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now you're moving into the second phase where you will use a staff

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and have to get through a wire maze.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How many can you put on each side and feel safe?

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
David heading out through the second phase.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Not only do you have to navigate the wires, you also have to step over the rope.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Very difficult to maintain your balance during this.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Adam is good. He can start on this second phase.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It is now Will, the only person who cannot get through that first phase.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Everybody else working on the second phase.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Nobody took all 10 disks at once, so everybody's going to have to make at least two runs.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Brett is the first one through. He's got four.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're good. Get him on there and head back.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It is now Brett in the lead.

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Here comes Jay with his first six.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
David near the end of the wire maze.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Jay's good. He can head back for his last four.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It is now Brett and Jay in the lead.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
David is back with his first six disks.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Ken is back.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Adam heading back.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Zunde and Hannah falling out of this quickly.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And Will still back at the beginning of this challenge.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, thanks, Jeff.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Jay is the first one through.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Here comes David. He's through now.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Jay has all 10 disks.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He's in the final phase, rolling them into a target.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He's got one. He's got to get all 10 in there.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
David, he can start rolling.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Brett is finished. He can start rolling.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It is now Jay, Brett, and David.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
David has one. David has another.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
There's another one for Jay.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Jay getting hot. He's got four.

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Brett gets one. Jay with another.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's five for Jay. Make it six for Jay.

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Just misses.

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Jay, Brett, Jay, all rolling disks now.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There's another for Brett. It is six for Jay.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Two for Brett. Two for David.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There's a seven, eight, nine.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
One left for Jay for the win right here.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And he does it. Jay wins.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Individual immunity. Safe from tribal council.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Huge effort.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Jay, come on over.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Jay, safe from the vote tonight, cannot be voted out of this game.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Will live to see day 35.

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
As for the rest of you, somebody going home tonight will become the sixth member of our jury.

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Thank you, sir.

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It felt phenomenal to win, you know?

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've already won two individual challenges, but anytime Jeff says, Jay wins immunity, I'm like, damn right I want immunity.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Put that thing around my neck. Let me go back to camp and I'll go spearfishing if I want to.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't even need to talk to any of these fools.

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And plus, I still have my idol and I'm going to hold on to this baby until I really have to use it.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Good job, Jay.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Thank you.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That was fun. Nice job, Jay.

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Thank you, thank you.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Good job.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Good fight.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Jay, again, you know, three of the last four challenges, he's won.

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He got the immunity challenge today.

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And we would have probably targeted Jay tonight had he not won.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But now we don't know what's going on.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's how the game goes.

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We're going to have to go through the whole process.

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The whole process.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The whole process.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The whole process.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The whole process.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The whole process.

190
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The whole process.

191
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The whole process.

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The whole process.

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The whole process.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The whole process.

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The whole process.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The whole process.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What's going on.

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's how this game is being played right now.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You never know from one day to the next.

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So tonight's completely up in the air.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You see how, um, David's kind of like dying.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Basically, yep, he can't win a challenge.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Can, can.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But David is a weasel.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That'll be the salt at the end of Ken somehow gets to the end.

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Not even a contest.

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay.

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm down.

209
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So you want to take David out for Ken.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,800
I have a working relationship with every single person left in the game.

212
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,600
People want my vote, people want my input.

213
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,300
It's David.

214
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, that's what you told me.

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm done being afraid, you know, let's just get the hell off the safe.

216
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,800
Oh, but you good?

217
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,300
Okay, I'm good with that.

218
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,200
So I have to talk to people and get people to realize that David's the kind of guy where

219
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,300
if he gets to the end, he will beat anybody, and that includes me.

220
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,200
Which means to me, I need him out of this game.

221
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,600
I think we just go for David.

222
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,000
I agree. Let's just cut the head off this thing, I'm on you.

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,500
Yeah.

224
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,200
I need them to feel like, hey, I'm an equal contributor here.

225
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,700
At the end of the day, they're not.

226
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,300
I'm the one calling the shots.

227
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,700
So many conversations are happening.

228
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,900
Unfortunately, because Jay is now safe tonight at Tribal,

229
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:28,200
there is so much scrambling going around, and the most insecurity I've ever felt is right now.

230
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,200
You know, dude, I just hope I survive tonight.

231
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
That's my goal too.

232
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
At the last Tribal, Will voted with us.

233
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
It was great.

234
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But the thing is, Will is looking to pad his resume a little bit more.

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,800
So if Will is smart, the thing to do is to follow up a big move with yet another big move.

236
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,700
And there's this perception in the Tribe that I'm the biggest threat in the game.

237
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,400
And so, yeah, why wouldn't you want to get rid of me tonight?

238
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,900
Hannah just filled me in.

239
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,400
Yeah.

240
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Oh, David.

241
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,900
Are you threatening somebody?

242
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Yeah, we're threatening somebody.

243
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Oh, David.

244
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,400
I'm with you guys.

245
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
I told you, last vote, I'm not voting your name.

246
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
This vote, I'm working with you.

247
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,100
Will's preference right off the bat is obviously to vote out Dave next.

248
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,600
Will thinks now he has a degree of power and he is in control.

249
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,100
And that makes him more dangerous.

250
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,600
So to me, Will is a bigger threat.

251
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,600
And I do not want to put myself in a position where Will is, you know, controlling my fate in this game.

252
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,100
Will, I think, genuinely wants to go far with me.

253
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,600
But I'm not interested in that.

254
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,600
And I don't want to work with someone who's going to flip back and forth.

255
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,600
So the plan is I'm voting Will tonight.

256
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Okay.

257
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,600
I think Adam's been smart about how he's been playing this.

258
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
And we have some common goals that we're looking to make.

259
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
So me and Sunday agree.

260
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
We'll go with Adam and vote together.

261
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Tommy, what's your name?

262
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm voting off me.

263
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Brett and Sunday, I think, are actually willing to vote out Will.

264
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Do you feel like this is the right move against someone who just rescued us from a really bad situation?

265
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Because we were screwed.

266
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Like in his mob alliance, we're going to take us all out.

267
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Yes.

268
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
And I was going home.

269
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I get that Will did it for his own game.

270
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
But, you know.

271
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm torn up as I always am emotionally because Will saved my butt in the game.

272
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
So it's like I do owe Will in a sense, but I also feel like I owe David in a sense.

273
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,600
I mean, David pulled a rock for me and we have always been allies.

274
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
So, you know, you end up owing more than one person.

275
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Dave could flip because he knows that we're not going to want to sit next to him in the end.

276
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Right.

277
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Because he knows we're not.

278
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
He's going to have to keep moving in order to stay in this game.

279
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Right.

280
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
You know what I mean?

281
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
So we may have to actually do David next.

282
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
So what do you want to do?

283
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Right now, Hannah and I are in power positions.

284
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,600
We can decide who goes home next.

285
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
It's a really tough choice.

286
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Brett and Sunday are in a weak position.

287
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
They're going to vote the way that I want them to vote.

288
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:22,600
So the question is, blindside Will and take out someone who I do believe is loyal to me at this point.

289
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Or try to blindside Dave and take out potentially the biggest threat in this game.

290
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,600
So we have a huge decision to make tonight.

291
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:54,600
This is the moment where I start making the moves that I need to make to win this game.

292
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Now bring in the members of our jury.

293
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Michelle, Taylor, Chris, Jessica, and Zeke voted out at the Last Tribal Council.

294
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,600
So Will, Last Tribal Council, everything centered around you.

295
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
You were the swing vote.

296
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
You wanted to show your playing.

297
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
You made a big move, took out Zeke.

298
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
What was the reaction when you got back to camp?

299
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Yeah, I wrote Zeke's name down.

300
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
And then Adam also played an idol when he didn't have to.

301
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,600
And that caused a lot of stir around camp, for sure.

302
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Jay, how did Will's move shake out when you guys got back to camp?

303
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,600
I mean, I was proud of him as a fan, but as a player, it sucked.

304
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
So David, Will makes a big move.

305
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
It was 4-4.

306
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
What does it do to the game?

307
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Well, I have deep concerns that it might be me.

308
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Jay, should David be worried?

309
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I mean, considering the last vote, Will went with that side of the two alliances.

310
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,600
So if they trust in Will, then Will should be sticking with them, shouldn't he?

311
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Hannah, what was your takeaway from Will's move in terms of what it does to the game and the numbers and the alliances?

312
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,600
The fascinating thing to me is almost everyone up here has both worked with people up here and also worked against people up here.

313
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,600
And I think you want to play with people who want to play with you and take out those threats left in the game.

314
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Adam, it's really tricky.

315
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
It all comes down to how do I get to the end and who do I take with me?

316
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,600
I mean, you think about who you want to sit next to at the end, but you also think about what's my best way to get there.

317
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,600
And a lot of the jury members made some really good moves in this game, and it probably contributed to them getting voted out.

318
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
So you have to weigh both options.

319
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,600
So the double-edged sword is you make a big move, great. Now you're a bigger threat. Watch out.

320
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Yeah.

321
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,600
David, that does really sum up where this season is.

322
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
It's going to be very hard to win this game if you don't have a resume.

323
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Just being a nice person will not get it done.

324
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,600
And yet every time you make a move, you also have everybody else going, yeah, that might be one too many.

325
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,600
It's a complicated game, and the thing is if you don't make big moves, then you're just a goat.

326
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,600
And then maybe you make it to final tribal, but you're not going to get the million dollars.

327
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,600
So it's really essential to make big moves as much as it does put a gigantic target on your back.

328
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Jay, what do you think is going to happen tonight?

329
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Because if I'm watching at home, I have no idea with this group who is going home tonight.

330
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,600
You know, considering, Jeff, everyone here is a player, I honestly am wondering who could it be?

331
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,600
They could go with an easy vote or someone could be trying to make a big move again.

332
00:17:43,600 --> 00:18:06,600
All right, it is time to vote. Will, you're up.

333
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I'll go tally the votes.

334
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,600
If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.

335
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
OK, once the votes are read, the decision is final.

336
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.

337
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,600
I'll read the votes.

338
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
First vote.

339
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
David.

340
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
David. Two votes, David.

341
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Will.

342
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Will. We're tied. Two votes, David. Two votes, Will.

343
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Will. That's three votes, Will. Two votes, David.

344
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Will. That's four votes, Will. Two votes, David.

345
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Thirteenth person voted out and the sixth member of our jury.

346
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Will, that's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.

347
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Will, the tribe has spoken.

348
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:55,600
How to bless, guys. Good luck to all of you.

349
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Well, with the game being played at this level, the natural instinct is to want to hide.

350
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,600
But in order to win this season, you must be seen.

351
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Grab your torch, let's head back to camp. Good night.

352
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Getting voted off as survivor is not something I wanted on my survivor resume,

353
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,600
but I am the youngest person to ever play survivor.

354
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:43,600
And to be able to experience this is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me so far in my life.

355
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Thanks a lot, guys. That worked.

356
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Dude, anytime that someone tries to make a plan with me, they end up going home.

357
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,600
I'm like the black plague right now. You know what I'm saying?

358
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,600
I am all alone. I have no alliance.

359
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,600
But tribal council has been a complete chaotic mess every single time.

360
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,600
You never know what's going to happen. So it's time for the underdog to keep fighting because I'm not going down without a fight.

361
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I still have an idol and there's still more immunities on the way and I'm not going down.

362
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm sorry that I lied to you again. I respect you fully. You and I have been.

363
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Like, it's like it's honestly crazy. It's like a yin-yang. You know what I'm saying? It's sick.

364
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:46,600
It's a sick relationship. Me and Adam have this. It's kind of like a yin-yang relationship where we love each other, but we hate each other.

365
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,600
And that's how it's been. What is your game, Adam? To take David to the end? Because he's going to take you out, dude.

366
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Well, I hope not. He will. He's not taking you to the end. And you can't beat David.

367
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,600
I'm not planning on taking David to the end. I'm trying to make Jay feel as comfortable as possible with me.

368
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:15,600
And so I tell Jay that the next move is to get rid of Dave. But to me, Jay has to go home.

369
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:23,600
You have an idol. Yeah. I'm not going home. I know. I'll take you to the end if I win.

370
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,600
He has a hidden immunity idol and we have to take every opportunity we can to take a stab at the guy.

371
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,600
If he doesn't have immunity, he needs to go home.

372
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Come on in, guys.

373
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,600
I like it. Oh, my goodness.

374
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Guys, ready to get to today's immunity challenge? Yeah. Yeah.

375
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
First things first, Jay, it's becoming familiar. Yes, sir.

376
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Take it back.

377
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs for today's challenge. You're going to solve a block puzzle.

378
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,600
There's a twist. You will have a timer in the form of a survivor pinball table.

379
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Here's how it works. You're going to roll your ball.

380
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,600
As long as the ball is making its way down the table, you can work on solving the puzzle.

381
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,600
When the ball reaches the bottom, you catch it, roll it again, go back to your puzzle.

382
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:51,600
If, however, the ball drops before you catch it, there is a time penalty as the ball slowly makes its way to the bottom, during which you cannot work on your puzzle.

383
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Oh, my God. So it becomes a challenge of split focus.

384
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:00,600
You have to focus on the puzzle in order to solve it, but you also have to focus on where the ball is on the table.

385
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
First to finish their puzzle.

386
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Wins immunity, guaranteed a one in six shot.

387
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Winning this game, losers travel council where somebody will become the seventh member of our jury.

388
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Big stakes, fun challenge. Let's do it. Drop the spots. Get started.

389
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,600
All right, here we go. Four immunity, one in six shot.

390
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Survivors ready. Go.

391
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,600
You got to roll the ball. And while the ball is in play, you can start working on your puzzle.

392
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Brett having trouble just getting the ball up there.

393
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,600
It's going to take a bit of a learning curve. Jay is the first to fill the time penalty.

394
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
He now cannot work on his puzzle until that ball stops.

395
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Slowly makes its way to the bottom. And I mean slowly.

396
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Just happened to David. He's got to wait.

397
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:12,600
A puzzle that would normally take a fair amount of time is going to take a lot of time because your focus is split.

398
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
So you can only think about this puzzle a little bit.

399
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,600
While part of your brain is thinking about where that ball is. Oh my God.

400
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Hannah just misses her ball. It drops. She's got to wait.

401
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,600
If your ball drops, you got to make use of the time Adam just misses.

402
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
He can't get to his ball. Ken drops. He's got to wait.

403
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Oh, it's so slow. How that ball makes its way down that track.

404
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
This is so hard.

405
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:48,600
All you can do while your ball is out of play is study your puzzle. See if you can figure out your next move.

406
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,600
David's starting to make some progress on his puzzle.

407
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Hannah making some progress. Jay doing a nice job with his puzzle.

408
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Jay drops again. Cannot work. Ken now back at it.

409
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,600
He's got something going. David with some nice work.

410
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Hannah with a nice save. Ken is very close.

411
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,600
David working on his puzzle again. It's now David in the lead.

412
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not.

413
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Ken out of nowhere. Ken thinks he has it.

414
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Ken is wrong. Keep going.

415
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,600
What is wrong? We've been counting on you.

416
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Ken is wrong. Keep going. What is wrong? We've been playing with this logo all season.

417
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Ken now making a change. That opens the door for David and Jay.

418
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Ken, I'm going to tell you when your ball is dropping. You've got to come back.

419
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Everybody trying to catch Ken. David drops.

420
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Keep working. Ken is still wrong. Ken going to try again to change it.

421
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Ken, come back. Ken, come back. Ken, come back.

422
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Whoa, nice save by Ken. Really, Adam?

423
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Does he have it this time?

424
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Come on. Yes.

425
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Ken wins. Individual immunity. Safe from the vote.

426
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,600
We'll make it to the final six.

427
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,600
That was fun, but that was crazy.

428
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Good job.

429
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Ken, come on over. Good job, Ken.

430
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Apparently when you haven't eaten for 35 days, you can't spill.

431
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,600
You got it right the second time. Ken, safe from the vote.

432
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,600
You will make it to the final six. Live to see day 36. As for the rest of you,

433
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,600
after 35 very tough days in this game, it will come to an end for one of you.

434
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Tribal council tonight, somebody going home. It won't be you.

435
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats.

436
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Jay is one of the strongest contenders in this game, and it's definitely a struggle to sit there

437
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,600
and watch someone who's a younger version of myself doing what I would have been doing

438
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,600
10 years ago. So I felt good about wearing the idol around my neck as opposed to Jay.

439
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Great job, Ken. Nice job, Ken. Unbelievable. Good work, buddy.

440
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,600
I thought you weren't a puzzle guy. Simple puzzles like that, yeah.

441
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Slide puzzles and all those, definitely not. My biggest fear going into the challenge

442
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,600
was that Jay or Dave would win immunity. Of course, I would have preferred to win

443
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,600
myself, but if I couldn't win, I was glad it was Ken. I need firewood so I can cook.

444
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,600
I'll go with you. Yeah.

445
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,600
He's so poor. Adam helped him. He didn't win that thing.

446
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
I didn't want Dave to win. He was right behind him.

447
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Yeah, I wanted to do everything I could to help Ken, because the most important thing

448
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,600
about the challenge is Jay did not win and Dave did not win.

449
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,600
I swear to God, you guys, I'm voting David tonight. If you want to take me out later,

450
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,600
take me out later, but just let me stay over these two, please, God.

451
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,600
My plan tonight is in the case that Jay does play his idol, Dave would go home.

452
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Look, I want Jay to go home tonight, but the safest thing to do, especially to keep me around...

453
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Is to take Brett home. Yeah.

454
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,600
I don't feel great about the state of my game at all, especially since Jay will be afraid

455
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,600
that we're throwing votes towards his way, and if he does have an idol and he does play it,

456
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,600
I automatically go home. Can we just tell you our plan?

457
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Can I really? Okay, tell me your plan. Okay, so, ostensibly, we are a voting block of four.

458
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Okay. You, me, Ken, Adam. Yeah, that's true.

459
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Okay, we throw three votes at Brett, one vote to Jay, and then Sunday, Brett and Jay will throw

460
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,600
three votes at me. Jay will, if he has an idol, will play it, he'll be safe. Yeah.

461
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Then there's a tie between Brett and myself, and there'll be a re-vote, and then we flip all the votes

462
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,600
to a Brett vote, and Brett goes home. This is my only question. So, we're throwing three votes Brett.

463
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Why not Sunday, and here's why. Sunday, at this point, is such an enticing goat, and the longer

464
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,600
she's in the game, the scarier I feel that someone like Adam, who's playing really hard,

465
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,600
will flip on one of us to try to go with Sunday. Okay. I mean, can you get behind that, Ken?

466
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Okay. All right, all right, well, let's get with that.

467
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,600
It is important at some point to split up Brett and Sunday.

468
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Sunday's extremely dangerous because she's sort of made herself into a tenting goat,

469
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,600
and people could want to sit next to her, and I'm very scared that someone who worked less hard

470
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,600
will get a spot that I've worked really hard for.

471
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Let's talk about tonight. Yeah. Jay is two immunity wins away from winning this game.

472
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Yeah. All I know is that I need to vote for Jay tonight.

473
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,600
He's gonna play his idol. And then if he does, who do the other three go to?

474
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Dave. I definitely want to be walking back here after tribal council with David,

475
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,600
who has been my closest ally and my closest friend, but Adam's afraid of David,

476
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,600
doesn't want to play against David. We need to vote for Jay. We need to get rid of his idol.

477
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,600
I had a long conversation with Ken and Hannah, and throughout the entire conversation,

478
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,600
I knew what I wanted to do. We have to put enough votes on Jay that if he doesn't play his idol,

479
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:11,600
he goes home, and we have to put enough votes on Dave that if he does play his idol, Dave goes home.

480
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,600
The only way around it is if the four of us vote for Sunday, but that risks Jay moving forward

481
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,600
with an idol in his pocket. And if Jay were to win again, we'd be in big trouble.

482
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:28,600
If we vote for Sunday, it would leave both Jay and Dave in the game, and they're two strong strategic players,

483
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
so we have to make sure that one of them goes home.

484
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Do you feel good? Yeah. I mean, as sad as it is, these are the two biggest risks.

485
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,600
If Jay goes home tonight, that's huge. He could win every immunity going.

486
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:46,600
There are so many moving parts to tonight's vote, and the worst thing that we can have is tomorrow morning,

487
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Jay is still in this game with an idol in his pocket.

488
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
You're going to have to play your idol.

489
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Why that big of a threat to you that you have to strip me of everything?

490
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Yeah.

491
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,600
That's the only way that I'd beat you. I hate you.

492
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,600
It's Adam telling me, I know you have the idol, I'm going to force you to play it.

493
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,600
But Adam always lies to me, so in all honesty, my name might not even come up tonight,

494
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,600
and if I feel like not playing the idol, then I might just do it.

495
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
You're forcing my hand. I'm not forcing it.

496
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Yes, you are. I'm not going home, Adam. It's me and you until the end.

497
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Just get me there, man. Please. I need to.

498
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
I know. I know it means a lot to you.

499
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,600
It means a lot to me, too, that I'm in the same boat.

500
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
And that's why I came with it.

501
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I can't waste my opportunity.

502
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Can I tell you something that I haven't told anyone in this game?

503
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
What?

504
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
My mom has stage four lung cancer.

505
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,600
And she's already been through three treatments.

506
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,600
And I found out when my brother came in the third one, it isn't working either.

507
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,600
That's why this has been so much to me, I'm doing it for her.

508
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,600
She wants to watch me get to the end.

509
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
That's why I can't waste this opportunity.

510
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,600
I've been scared for the past nine years, and my mom's going to die, bro.

511
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
I'm so scared.

512
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
I love my mom just like he does.

513
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,600
And it's crazy because, like, my mom's got brain aneurysms.

514
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Me and Adam are both out here for our families, for our moms.

515
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,600
He's not a Weasel in my book anymore. He's a good freaking dude. He's a warrior.

516
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
I think I might vote for Sunday.

517
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Oh, I hate you.

518
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Okay, here's why. Even if Jay gets through with an adult, if Sunday goes home, then we've just saved David's ass and we have a more loyal four.

519
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I don't want to do that.

520
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Why not?

521
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Because I think one of the two of them has to go home tonight.

522
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Why?

523
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Because there are huge threats in this game.

524
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Adam's reluctance to vote out Sunday is my reluctance, too, because it leaves a visible threat in the game, which is David.

525
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:38,600
The problem is, if Jay plays his idol and David goes home, I lose David, who I freaking love.

526
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
So I don't know the right choice.

527
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:52,600
But the kind of person that makes a decision and convinces other people of that decision is the kind of person that wins Survivor.

528
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Now bring in the members of our jury.

529
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Michelle, Taylor, Chris, Jessica, Zeke, and Will voted out at the last travel council.

530
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:25,600
So David, right now in the game, do friendships and alliances really matter or is it everybody for themselves and all bets are off?

531
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:31,600
I actually think you have to lean on friendships and bonds even more than at the beginning or middle of the game.

532
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
I think they're incredibly important.

533
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Jay, do you agree with that? Do bonds have currency?

534
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Yeah, you are relying on alliances, which, you know, I don't see any of mine sitting here anymore.

535
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:50,600
But Jay, is that where you feel a little pressure is that you're clearly a threat and tonight you don't have the protection of the necklace.

536
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Honestly, Jeff, a challenge threat is a big deal. But if you have a challenge threat who's sitting up here with a necklace on his neck, who has an alliance, what's bigger?

537
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,600
The guy who's alone or the guy that has friends that have his back?

538
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Brett, what is Jay saying?

539
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Jay's saying he wishes he had that necklace around his neck because he's very scared tonight.

540
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,600
David, Jay's saying I'm just one guy, but that all depends on perspective.

541
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Yeah, you know, another term you could use would be a free agent. And so if there are people looking to make a move, you can exploit someone like a free agent.

542
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
You've taken a lot of heat, David.

543
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
I have.

544
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:34,600
For several Tribals, people have said you're a legitimate threat to win this game and we've got to take you out. And yet, here you still sit.

545
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I do. I don't know that that'll be true after tonight. But yes, I've relied heavily on friendships and alliances to still be sitting here.

546
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Adam, you seem to have a reaction to that. Is David right or wrong?

547
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Yeah, Dave's in the majority pretty much every vote, has impressed people with his work around camp, with his transformation, and that's what juries love to root for.

548
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Hannah, we keep coming back to this whole conundrum. Who to get rid of, who to take, based on what we think the jury's going to think.

549
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Yeah, a lot of discussion has been around who are the threats to win at the end, because I think every single person here has already written their final speech, and that's been a main point of discussion for all of us.

550
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Sunday, what do you think is thought of you right now? Are you somebody that they should take to the end or are you a threat to get rid of tonight?

551
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:34,600
You know, obviously I'm not a physical threat, and so I think I'm a person that people are thinking, oh, I'll just take her to the end.

552
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Meaning, you can't get any votes?

553
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:43,600
I think I can get votes, but I think there are people that think that I can't get votes, and so I think I'm a little bit underestimated.

554
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Adam, if the perception of Sunday is true, it works to Sunday's advantage.

555
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Suddenly it's like, maybe you should take me to the end, and maybe I can still beat you even though you clearly have no confidence in me.

556
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Yeah, I mean the reality is everyone in this group right now has been playing their own game.

557
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:07,600
It's just a matter of what is the perception of the jury, and that's what you have to take into account when deciding who you want to sit next to at the end.

558
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Alright, it is time to vote. Sunday, you're up.

559
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,600
I'll go tally the votes.

560
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,600
If anybody has a hidden immunity addle and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.

561
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Alright.

562
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,600
I'd rather be safe than sorry, Jeff.

563
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,600
You guys get to play with me some more.

564
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,600
This is a hidden immunity addle. Any votes cast for Jay will not count.

565
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
I read the votes.

566
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:32,600
First vote, Jay does not count.

567
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,600
David, one vote David.

568
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,600
David, two votes David.

569
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Sunday, two votes David, one vote Sunday.

570
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Sunday, two votes David, two votes Sunday.

571
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Sunday, that's three votes Sunday, two votes David, one vote left.

572
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,600
I knew it, I didn't have to use it.

573
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,600
Fourteenth person voted out, the seventh member of our jury. Sunday, you need to bring me your torch.

574
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Sunday, the chart was spoke.

575
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Good luck guys, have fun. Thanks Sunday.

576
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Take care.

577
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Dang it.

578
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,600
Well, 35 days ago we began this season, Millennials versus Gen X.

579
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:39,600
So it is only fitting that there are three Millennials, three Gen X, as we begin the battle to the finish.

580
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night.

581
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

582
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:08,600
Next time on Survival, Six are Left, and the game is still up in the air.

583
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,600
If I have to do dirty tricks like this, then so be it.

584
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
An idol can screw everything up.

585
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,600
I have the legacy advantage that you got in store for me.

586
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Who will outlast all the others?

587
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Every person here is a legitimate threat to win this game.

588
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,600
And claim the title of sole survivor.

589
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Join us for the finale.

590
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Having to go home now this close to the end is just gut wrenching because you can see the finish line.

591
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,600
But I know my family is going to be beyond proud of how I played.

592
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,600
I slept in the dirt for 30 days. I did challenges I would have never done.

593
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,600
I jumped off things I never would have jumped off of.

594
00:42:46,600 --> 00:43:07,600
I am honestly leaving feeling so proud of myself and I have zero regrets about it.
