gravitate more towards the older

Eliza tomorrow and see where her

stack it and free wrap it...

131
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,520
the thing that really gets under

132
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,648
my skin is he doesn't do a lot

133
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,859
of, you know, physical work.

134
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,653
He's not a team player.

135
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,946
He's an individualist.

136
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,572
But in a team, you can't be your

137
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,657
own man all the time.

138
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,784
It has to be about the team.

Sarge, if you don't feel that

158
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,314
I'm pulling my weight, then you

159
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,482
come to me and say, "Rory, you

160
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,649

isolating himself from the

00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,643
but who's getting firewood?

193
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,602
Somebody might be doing the

194
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,603
shelter, but who's getting the

195
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,523
palm fronds? So, I...

196
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,524
>> No, honey. Just listen.

197
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,525
>> Last night was ridiculous.

198
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,609
> Am I on your side or what?

199
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,569
>> Now, wait a minute.

200
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,737
We've all asked you all...

201
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,530
>> Twila, we've done a ton of

202
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,157
work.

203
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,491
>> I'm not saying you didn't.

204
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,492
>> You start a fire in the

205
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,285
morning.

206
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,286
We could easily start that fire

207
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,287
in the morning if you were not

208
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,663
here.

209
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,165
You played it up last night, and

210
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,916
it's bull...

211
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,667
It's the card that you're

212
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,085
playing, and it's going to

213
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,587
backfire.

214
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,045
>> I'm not saying that

215
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,173
you all didn't do any work.

216
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,549
I said some do more than others.

217
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,926
>> Because you play the martyr

218
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,761
and you take on that role.

219
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,721
You take the martyr and you play

220
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,015
on that role.

221
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,224
If you were not here, we would

222
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,726
still have fire and shelter and

223
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,852
food.

224
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,353
That's it.

225
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,897
>> You stay here five

226
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,940
minutes, then your asses go

227
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,650
down there in the ocean, so

228
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,735
don't give me no bull, bitch,

229
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,486
because I will whip your butt.

230
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,030
>> It's your only card.

231
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,531
Keep playing it.

232
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,533
Bitch.

233
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,951
Twila and I were fighting about

234
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:14,577
the fact that she threw us all

235
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,703
under the bus last night, the

236
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,039
young'uns in the group, about

237
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,041
being lazy.

238
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,167
We've all pulled our weight

239
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,376
around here and I'm going to

240
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,003
call her out as much as

241
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,296
possible, because I can't stand

242
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,297
Twila-- I want her out.

243
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,298
>> No, you didn't say that.

244
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,007
You're lying.

245
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,008
If it's the damn truth, it would

246
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,009
be different, but you're damn

247
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:30,885
lying!

248
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,636
>> Whatever, Twila.

249
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,596
You play the martyr.

250
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,639
I don't care.

251
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,681
We all do our ... around here.

252
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,184
>> I didn't say everybody...

253
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:38,935
>> Yes, you did.

254
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:39,685
You called our asses out last

255
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,313
night.

256
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,856
>> Mia's mad because she knows I

257
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,440
was right.

258
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,358
Get off your ass and do

259
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:45,608
something.

260
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,817
Quit sitting on the beach and

261
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,069
going swimming when everybody

262
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,238
else's working.

263
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,322
Who was swimming down there...

264
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,365
>> Twila, because we were

265
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:52,907
swimming for ten minutes?

266
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,784
Who built this shelter?

267
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,410
Who got all the bamboo and the

268
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,203
palm fronds?

269
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,496
>> You honestly haven't seen...

270
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,330
>> Don't think you're going

271
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,498
to sit there and talk about me

272
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,123
and then today it's going to be

273
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,293
nice and lovey-dovey and kissy,

274
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,003
because you want to be fake.

275
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,838
>> I'm not going to sit

276
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,173
there and argue with her because

277
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,508
she's mad, but I ain't taking

278
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,801
her crap, I'll tell you that.

279
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,677
I'll whip the little scrawny

280
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,845
bitch's ass because I don't

281
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,680
care.

282
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,806
I ain't in it here to make no

283
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,849
friends.

284
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,780
>> So, what's up with you now?

285
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:33,739
Because everyone thinks you're

286
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,032
sketchy.

287
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:35,700
>> I feel like I am sketchy, but

288
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,659
I didn't ever make an alliance

289
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,910
with them.

290
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,078
I just said, "This time, we've

291
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,288
got to get rid of Dolly."

292
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,706
>> Okay, so there isn't like a

293
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,999
permanent thing going on?

294
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,000
>> No, no, no.

295
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:44,875
Julie and I went to get tree

296
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,794
mail and Julie was like, "Eliza,

297
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,130
are you still with us?"

298
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,256
And I was like, "I did what I

299
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,507
needed to do because, you know,

300
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,550
I didn't trust Dolly and I

301
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,175
thought that she was going to

302
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,719
vote for me."

303
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,722
>> Tree mail!

304
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,265
>> Oh, hey, you two.

305
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,392
Just the people we want to see.

306
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,311
>> Mia and Lisa walk up

307
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,062
to meet Julie and I, who are

308
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,480
coming back from getting tree

309
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:06,731
mail.

310
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:07,815
I'm with you 100%.

311
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,316
>> Okay.

312
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,859
>> I was like, "I'm with you

313
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,443
guys 100%."

314
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,902
>> Let's get rid of Twila.

315
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,321
I can't stand that bitch

316
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,030
anymore.

317
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,823
I'm about to bust ass.

318
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,825
Dude, Eliza, don't switch.

319
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,075
>> Please.

320
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,536
Please.

321
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,287
>> As long as the four of

322
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,705
us are still strong, we'll pull

323
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,080
somebody else in.

324
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,833
>> Well, I'm not so sure

325
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,128
that Eliza is in with us.

326
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:29,962
Even then, I don't know if I

327
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,839
trust her.

328
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,550
But I've got a backup plan, so

329
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,386
we'll see what happens.

330
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,763
>> Okay, ready?

331
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:39,764
"This next challenge is a tough

332
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,473
one.

333
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,057
Both tribes should feel quite

334
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,600
stressed.

335
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,684
The island's aura darkens.

336
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,020
Today, all friendships will be

337
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,480
put to the test.

338
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:47,980
A long day and night for

339
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,440
everyone.

340
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,441
Yes, there is need to worry."

341
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:50,900
>> Oh, no!

342
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,026
>> "With immunity on the

343
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:52,818
line, you better finish in a

344
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,277
hurry."

345
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,320
>> Immunity! Oh, my God!

346
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,237
>> Immunity, again?

347
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,239
Back-to-back ones?

348
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:57,907
>> We went to Tribal Council

349
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,784
last night and we have tree mail

350
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:05,456
talking about immunity.

351
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,874
And that bites because yesterday

352
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,042
sucked big time and I don't want

353
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,543
to go through it again two days

354
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:19,887
in a row.

355
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,847
>> PROBST: What's up, guys?

356
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,015
You look good.

357
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:23,432
>> Feel good, Jeff.

358
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:28,270
>> PROBST: Yasur, come on in!

359
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,147
Guys, get your first look at the

360
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,565
new Yasur tribe, minus one

361
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,567
member.

362
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,819
>> Who's gone, then?

363
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,404
>> PROBST: Dolly, voted out at

364
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,488
the last Tribal Council.

365
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,114
>> Dolly?

366
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,615
>> Dolly, the blonde.

367
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,409
>> Oh, Barbie's gone.

368
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,618
>> PROBST: All right, first

369
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:42,952
things first.

370
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,790
Chad, take back immunity.

371
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,793
Immunity back up for grabs.

372
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,254
Today, you are playing for both

373
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,589
reward and immunity.

374
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,216
(<i> applause</i> )

375
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,009
Here's the twist: both tribes

376
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,553
will vote out one member

377
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,597
tonight.

378
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,641
Separate Tribal Councils, two

379
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,767
people going home.

380
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,227
>> No!

381
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,061
>> PROBST: You'll first compete

382
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,565
tribe versus tribe for reward.

383
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,733
The winning tribe will then move

384
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,569
on and take part in an

385
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,820
individual immunity challenge

386
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,989
where one person will win

387
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,532
immunity.

388
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,451
They will be safe from the vote.

389
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,034
The losing tribe, they will go

390
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,162
to a separate Tribal Council.

391
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,080
They will vote out one member.

392
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:28,914
To be clear: two people going

393
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,876
home by the end of the day.

394
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,502
Okay, let me explain the reward

395
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,337
challenge.

396
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,422
You'll make your way through

397
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,424
three caged walls.

398
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,550
First wall, you're going to

399
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,385
untie a series of planks, get

400
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,554
yourself through a gate.

401
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,222
For the second wall, you'll use

402
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,725
grappling hooks, toss them out,

403
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,143
retrieve three rings with keys

404
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,895
from the sand.

405
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,855
Then open three locks, release

406
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,523
that gate, climb through.

407
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,941
For the third wall, you'll untie

408
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,487
a series of interlocking poles

409
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,029
until you can slide up the

410
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,157
center section, climb through.

411
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,492
First tribe to get all eight

412
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,826
members on their finish mat wins

413
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,329
reward and a shot at individual

414
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:08,996
immunity.

415
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,165
Big enough stakes?

416
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:11,874
>> Roger.

417
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,082
>> Yeah.

418
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,709

>> Yeah!

421
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,631

>> PROBST: ... and sinkers.

426
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,892
And today, what you covet:

427
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,811
Individual immunity for the

428
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,188
winner of the second phase of

429
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,064
the challenge.

430
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,192
Anything not clear?

431
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,568
Take your spots.

432
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,780
Wait for my go.

433
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,365
Here we go, for reward and a

Survivors, ready?

436
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,161
Go!

437
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,668
>> Okay, this knot is important.

438
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,669

439
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,670

>> Here, key!

570
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,365
Right here, right here.

571
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,116
Right here.

572
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:32,533

573
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,200

00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,374
>> Don't! Get off!

580
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,209

>> Lopevi!

592
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,393

immunity!

596
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,481
>> Yeah!

597
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,107
>> PROBST: Yasur, take a seat on

You'll be sitting this next

600
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,695
challenge out.

601
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,571
All right, Lopevi,

602
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,280
congratulations.

603
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,030
>> Yeah!

604
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,407
>> PROBST: You now have a

605
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,825
Hawaiian sling, fishing gear and

606
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,576
a mask.

607
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,827
You're also going to take part

608
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,786
in an individual immunity

609
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,662
challenge.

610
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,246
Here's how it works.

611
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,124
Buried in each of these lanes

612
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,209
are seven ladder rungs.

613
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,294
Your job: to dig up the rungs,

614
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,213
put your ladder together.

615
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,007
Keep in mind, each rung is

616
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,842
unique and will not fit in every

617
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,301
slot.

618
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,594
First person to put their ladder

619
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,178
together correctly and get to

620
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,764
the top wins immunity.

621
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,347
Make sense?

622
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:37,598
>> Yeah.

623
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,974
>> PROBST: Take a spot.

624
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,727
Wait for my go.

625
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,603
Here we go, guys.

626
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,063
At stake: individual immunity,

627
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,148
ensuring your safety at

628
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,067
tonight's Tribal Council.

629
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,777
Survivors, ready?

630
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,070
Go!

631
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,113
Brady trying to figure out how

632
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,406
deep they are.

633
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,533
Sarge has his first piece.

634
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,035
So does Chad.

635
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,370
John, there's his first.

636
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,164
Brady on the board.

637
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,707
Bubba, I don't know what he's

638
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,541
looking for.

639
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,292
(<i> laughter</i> )

640
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,003
Chad has two.

641
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,630
Rory putting his feet to work

642
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,465
digging.

643
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,258
John with another piece.

644
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,551
(<i> cheers</i> )

645
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,135
Bubba finally on the board.

646
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,763
(<i> laughter</i> )

647
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,848
Chad digging into that sand,

648
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,642
finds another one.

649
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,268
John with five.

650
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,437
Chad with six, looking for

651
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,607
seven.

652
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,358
Chris with another piece, up to

653
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,027
five.

654
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,529
Only two shy.

655
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,697
Chad has his seventh piece.

656
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,448
He's got to start putting his

657
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,826
puzzle together.

658
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,160
John has his seventh piece.

659
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,036
Going to start putting his

660
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,329
ladder together.

661
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,747
Remember, guys, this is a

662
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:43,997
puzzle.

663
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,249
Each rung only fits one way into

664
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,459
the ladder.

665
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,670
Chad's got another piece.

666
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,129
John with another piece.

667
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,050
Chad with five.

668
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,176
J.P. with his seventh piece.

669
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,803
He's putting his ladder

670
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,971
together.

671
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,347
Chad trying to find out which

672
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,016
piece is not right.

673
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,144
John working on his last piece.

674
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,981
He's got it.

675
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:13,193
John wins immunity!

676
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,695
>> Good job, John.

677
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,320
>> PROBST: Came from behind.

678
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,822
Nice job.

679
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,322
Congratulations.

680
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,491
You're safe at tonight's Tribal

681
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,450
Council.

682
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,410
There's one other thing.

683
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,202
Come on down.

684
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:26,957
>> One other thing.

685
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,541
>> PROBST: John, you're now

686
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,168
going to leave and go back to

687
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,796
camp with Yasur.

688
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,463
Join them.

689
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,841
(<i> laughter and applause</i> )

690
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,426
>> Whoo!

691
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,135
>> Welcome.

692
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,469
>> PROBST: Now, before you get

693
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,971
too excited, it's not forever.

694
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:41,972
You're going to go back to Camp

695
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:42,723
Yasur.

696
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,516
You'll be gathering information

697
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,267
for a very big decision, because

698
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,436
tonight you will return to

699
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,354
Tribal Council where you will

700
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,355
meet Lopevi.

701
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:50,939
You guys will have your own

702
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,274
Tribal Council.

703
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,525
You'll be safe.

704
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,277
One of these guys is going home.

705
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,279
When your tribal is over, you

706
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,822
will stay behind.

707
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,948
Yasur comes in.

708
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,532
You will give your immunity to

709
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,326
one member from Yasur.

710
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,620
You're not to discuss who you

711
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,413
are giving your immunity to.

712
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,456
You'll keep that a secret until

713
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,707
we get to Tribal Council.

714
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,291
>> All right.

715
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,335
>> PROBST: Head on out, guys.

716
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:34,942
>> Because I won the

717
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,985
immunity challenge, I can't get

718
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,402
voted off tonight.

719
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,445
But, strangely, there was a

720
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,322
little twist and I got a chance

721
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,616
to meet the women, see their

722
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,326
camp, and then pick one that can

723
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,161
have the necklace for their

724
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,246
Tribal Council.

725
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:48,956
So, who knows what's going to

726
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,581
happen tonight with both tribes

727
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,083
voting people off?

728
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:51,625
It could really change the

729
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,585
dynamics of both groups, big

730
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,170
time.

731
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,296
Everyone that voted for Dolly,

732
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,592
raise your hand.

733
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,426
All right.

734
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,681
You guys, this way.

735
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,682
>> When we hit the beach,

736
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,933
John immediately made a stand.

737
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,476
It's like, "Girls who voted for

738
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,144
Dolly over here and girls who

739
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,312
voted for Leann over here,"

740
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,313
which made no sense.

741
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:13,730
What does it matter?

742
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,439
I thought it was completely

743
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,691
ridiculous.

744
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,441
>> All right, guys.

745
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:24,324
Check it out.

746
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,450
>> All right, these four

747
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,410
guys were planning on voting me

748
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,453
out last night.

749
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:28,870
>> Take that back.

750
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,371
>> Wait a minute, wait a

751
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,580
minute.

752
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,748
>> Okay, okay, okay.

753
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,166
I didn't want John thinking that

754
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,251
this was some five-person

755
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,253
alliance, because that's

756
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,587
definitely not what it was.

757
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,338
I felt like I needed to explain

758
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,340
to him that it was because my

759
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,342
head was on the chopping block.

760
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,343
I go, "Dolly, look me in the eye

761
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:43,927
and tell me you're not writing

762
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:44,845
my name down."

763
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,595
She's like, "I don't know.

764
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,388
I don't want to vote with either

765
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:46,847
side.

766
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,597
I'm just going to vote for

767
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,223
someone random."

768
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,057
And I go, "Oh, she's voting

769
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:49,349
against me."

770
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:49,850
And then, it was like...

771
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:50,434
>> She was trying to play both

772
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,727
sides.

773
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,352
>> Yeah, she was.

774
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:52,728
>> It was a few...

775
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,520
>> JOHN: And she got caught.

776
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,813
>> Yeah.

777
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,939
>> It was a few hours

778
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,024
before Tribal Council and Dolly

779
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:57,232
goes...

780
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,442
>> That's all I need to know,

781
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:58,859
yeah.

782
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,318
>> I'm just going to go talk to

783
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:00,527
them.

784
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,695
>> She went up there and she

785
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,154
goes...

786
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,155
>> I'm just going to go talk to

787
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:03,363
them.

788
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:03,822
>> There's no way he's

789
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,573
giving her immunity, you know?

790
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,491
>> He's not going to give

791
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:06,950
any of them immunity.

792
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:07,451
>> Unless he wants to...

793
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,244
>> Good, Eliza, keep

794
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:09,453
talking.

795
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,078
Dig yourself in a hole, Eliza.

796
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,787
Stupid.

797
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,955
>> Yeah, and she won't let

798
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:12,497
anybody else talk.

799
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:12,914
>> I know, please.

800
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,457
>> Yesterday, after we

801
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,417
lost the immunity challenge, if

802
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,585
you would have looked at me, I

803
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:16,877
was crying.

804
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,461
It was so sad.

805
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,921
Like, we all get along so well.

806
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,256
Like, really, it's been amazing.

807
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:21,923
>> Mm-hmm.

808
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,216
Eliza just didn't stop talking.

809
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,217
She just kept talking and

810
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:24,968
talking and talking.

811
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,261
I mean, she seems really sweet.

812
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:26,928
I'm sure she's really nice, but

813
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,638
the bottom line is, "Oh, my God,

814
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,931
would you please stop talking?"

815
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,391
Hi, I'm John.

816
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,185
>> Mia.

817
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:33,894
>> JOHN: Nice to meet you.

818
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:34,436
>> I'm Lisa.

819
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,187
>> Julie.

820
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,396
>> JOHN: Nice to meet you.

821
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,439
All right, here's my question:

822
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,065
flat out, who do you guys think

823
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,316
you need to get off?

824
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,192
>> Just don't give it to

825
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:40,525
Twila, please.

826
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,151
>> JOHN: No, I won't give it to

827
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:41,777
Twila.

828
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,027
>> Please.

829
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,447
>> Or Eliza.

830
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,616
>> JOHN: The girls told me not

831
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,034
to give the immunity necklace to

832
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,660
Eliza and Twila, but I could

833
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,578
care less who gets voted off of

834
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,538
this tribe.

835
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,790
I just want them to not be mad

836
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,749
at me for whoever gets voted

837
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,417
off, because I might merge with

838
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,877
them and it would be nice to

839
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,504
have them on my side later on.

840
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,130
>> Here she comes.

841
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,173
She's going to work us now.

842
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,758
>> Oh, no, tell her to go away.

843
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,717
Whoa, this is our time.

844
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,302
>> Have you guys found any

845
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:07,511
grubs?

846
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,720
>> No.

847
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,181
>> So, what's up with you?

848
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,349
>> Yeah, dude, what's up?

849
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,100
Teetering?

850
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:13,558
>> I am not teetering.

851
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,811
>> You're<i> not</i> voting for me

852
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,061
tonight.

853
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,271
>> No way in hell.

854
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,231
Scout is a detriment in

855
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:19,523
challenges.

856
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,482
>> I don't want to vote for

857
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,066
Scout.

858
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,317
>> She thinks we can't...

859
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,818
>> I don't want to vote

860
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,693
for Scout.

861
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,402
>> I do.

862
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:24,986
>> I don't.

863
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,445
>> I do.

864
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:25,904
If it goes five-three?

865
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,489
>> I would rather vote for

866
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,323
Twila than Scout.

867
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,324
>> Then it would be a tie for

868
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:29,658
me.

869
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,867
>> I don't know what's

870
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,077
going on with them, I just know

871
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,078
they are not too happy with each

872
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:33,286
other.

873
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,621
To see some conflict like that,

874
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,331
it's going to fun to pick a girl

875
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,792
to not get voted off.

876
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,960
>> You just keep saying you

877
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:40,961
don't want there to be a tie,

878
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:41,169
well...

879
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,379
>> I know...

880
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,380
Honestly, I don't trust you,

881
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:43,672
Eliza.

882
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,798
>> Shh, let's not do this

883
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,632
right now.

884
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,133
>> Fine, don't trust me.

885
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:46,758
Fine, fine, because I'm going to

886
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,553
be the first one out anyhow.

887
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,596
You've been mad at me since I

888
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,973
voted for Dolly and I understand

889
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,599
why, but, like...

890
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:54,975
>> I'm over it.

891
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,268
>> Me, too.

892
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,269
>> I just want to know what's up

893
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:57,519
tonight.

894
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,687
>> Eliza, if we can get rid

895
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,771
of one of them tonight, it's us

896
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,189
four strong again, and they're

897
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,899
out.

898
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,234
Eliza seems to be teetering a

899
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,402
little bit, but tonight at

900
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,653
Tribal Council I'm almost

901
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,612
positive it's going to be a tie.

902
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,655
I mean, me and Twila had one of

903
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,158
our famous fights this morning,

904
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,576
so I think that me and Julie and

905
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,412
Lisa and Eliza are going to be

906
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,455
voting for Twila, and I'm pretty

907
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,957
sure that Leann and Ami and

908
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,667
Twila and Scout will be voting

909
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,543
for me tonight.

910
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,128
But, there's still individual

911
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,379
immunity to be given out, too,

912
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,965
so I don't know what's going to

913
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,009
happen.

914
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,263
>> Man, we kicked ass

915
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,598
on those rings, didn't we?

916
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:34,931
Man, oh, man.

917
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,558
We won the reward challenge.

918
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,560
It was a great feeling.

919
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,563
And then, after that, we ran

920
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,565
into the immunity challenge.

921
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,110
Out of most of the other guys, I

922
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,695
needed it the most, so I think

923
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,155
that I'm going to be quite

924
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:50,572
vulnerable tonight.

925
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,574
I would actually like to use the

926
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,659
term "dead man walking."

927
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,952
Brady's in the same boat.

928
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,120
We're the youngest guys there.

929
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,455
We're the strongest there.

930
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,041
And right now, it's five against

931
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:14,679
three.

932
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,555
We've got to plant the seed in

933
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,682
Sarge's head, saying, "Sarge,

934
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,601
ally with us or think about

935
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,854
getting rid of Rory," because

936
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,231
the Sarge and Rory are the last

937
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,899
few days have been having some

938
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:31,321
conflict.

939
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,530
What about this idea of after

940
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,865
the merge?

941
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,159
You need the group of guys that

942
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:36,660
you think, if they hang

943
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,786
together, will be the last

944
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,620
people in the game.

945
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,413
>> Right.

946
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,082
>> If one of the four of us can

947
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,250
win most of the challenges, we

948
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:43,875
just look out for each other and

949
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,709
we make sure we're the last

950
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,919
four.

951
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:46,294
>> It's possible.

952
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,630
It's possible.

953
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,965
>> It's simple.

954
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,050
It's not underhanded.

955
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,551
And we know our four votes are

956
00:25:53,635 --> 00:26:05,438
going in one direction.

957
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,523
>> I don't know.

958
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,400
I got a real bad feeling about

959
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,651
one of our pact, man.

960
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,403
He's just got a sorry attitude.

961
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,696
>> You don't have to

962
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,613
worry about no one in our pact,

963
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,072
I guarantee you that.

964
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:14,614
>> No, I ain't... I'm not

965
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,199
worried about that.

966
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:16,825
I have trouble working next to

967
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,160
him and being around him right

968
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,412
now.

969
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,037
>> Rory?

970
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:21,830
>> Yeah!

971
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,497
I'm like...

972
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,039
I mean...

973
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,165
>> Dude, I understand

974
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,292
what you're saying, and we'll

975
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,501
deal with it, but this just

976
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,712
isn't the time.

977
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,723
>> I hate Tribal Council.

978
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,351
I hate building a team of men or

979
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,353
survivors, building them up to a

980
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,397
fine-tuned team and then tearing

981
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:47,939
them down.

982
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,983
That's not me.

983
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:50,859
But I'm playing this game, and

984
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,571
during this game I have to do

985
00:26:54,654 --> 00:27:23,224
that.

986
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,726
>> PROBST: Bring in John.

987
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,810
He spent the afternoon over at

988
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:30,732
the Yasur camp.

989
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,401
I'm sure you had an interesting

990
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,194
afternoon.

991
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:34,819
>> Yes, I did.

992
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,737
>> PROBST: We'll get to that in

993
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,237
a minute.

994
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,072
First, though, I want to talk

995
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:37,781
about the tribe.

996
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,991
Chad, how have you seen this

997
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,369
tribe change and grow?

998
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:42,869
>> We've had camaraderie

999
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,039
since the very get-go, and I

1000
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,666
think that we've gained a lot of

1001
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,418
confidence by winning some of

1002
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,045
the challenges, and that's

1003
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,214
brought us closer together.

1004
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,006
>> PROBST: Brady, any first

1005
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,549
impressions here that have

1006
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,759
changed?

1007
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,718
>> I don't know if it's

1008
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,344
better or worse, but I certainly

1009
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,887
had a different impression of

1010
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,181
Sarge.

1011
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:03,807
Sarge is kind of a loud, booming

1012
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,310
personality, but Sarge is a much

1013
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:07,936
more personable guy than most

1014
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,979
people would probably give him

1015
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,730
credit for and that most people

1016
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,815
see.

1017
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,525
>> PROBST: So, John, while these

1018
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,068
guys are back at camp, you're

1019
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,278
over with the women.

1020
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,822
How aggressive were the women in

1021
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,990
terms of working you for that

1022
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:21,908
thing around your neck,

1023
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:22,158
immunity?

1024
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:22,742
>> You know what, as

1025
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,744
soon as I went in there, I said,

1026
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,663
"people who voted for Dolly," I

1027
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,831
said, "go over there.

1028
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,373
People who didn't vote for

1029
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,916
Dolly, go over there."

1030
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,209
And as soon as I divided them, I

1031
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,710
figured out what their alliances

1032
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,087
were, and it was really easy

1033
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,213
after I divided them.

1034
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,339
>> Good job.

1035
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:36,923
>> Oh!

1036
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,217
>> PROBST: Who knew young John

1037
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,051
was this bright?

1038
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,010
>> Good job!

1039
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:41,970
>> PROBST: So you feel very

1040
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,139
confident in the decision you're

1041
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:44,931
making?

1042
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,767
>> I feel 150% confident.

1043
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,269
>> PROBST: Now, let's get to

1044
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,353
this vote.

1045
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,855
J. P, what are you basing your

1046
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,439
vote on?

1047
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,148
>> I think you want

1048
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,441
this group as strong as possible

1049
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,067
going into that next challenge.

1050
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,318
Who are those individuals that

1051
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,611
have the particular strengths,

1052
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,195
the skill-sets, the mesh, the

1053
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,864
personality that can move

1054
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,365
forward and prepare for that

1055
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:02,949
merge?

1056
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:03,825
>> PROBST: Sarge, tough vote for

1057
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,119
you, or is this easy because

1058
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,620
friendship isn't part of this

1059
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,538
game?

1060
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:08,955
>> Friendships...

1061
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:09,747
I have

1062
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,832
friendships here, but I'm here

1063
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,958
to play a game.

1064
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,877
The person going home tonight is

1065
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,420
a casualty of war.

1066
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,713
>> PROBST: Okay, it's time to

1067
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:16,963
vote.

1068
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,339
John, you're wearing the

1069
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,466
immunity necklace.

1070
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,008
You're the only person safe.

1071
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,385
Everybody else is fair game.

1072
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,095
John, you're up first.

1073
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,983
>> I'm voting for you.

1074
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:37,525
I might be weaker than you

1075
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,027
physically, but I'm stronger

1076
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,612
than you mentally.

1077
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,656
It's just a game.

1078
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,206
>> Ain't nothing personal, man.

1079
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,042
I'm just being consistent.

1080
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,842
>> I'm voting for Rory

1081
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,594
tonight because you are the

1082
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,263
weakest guy in the tribe.

1083
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,473
Hopefully, there will be four

1084
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:08,932
votes to get you out.

1085
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,101
Or tie with me.

1086
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,321
>> This is our strategy.

1087
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,783
Sorry, my friend.

1088
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,424
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1089
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,468
votes.

1090
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,859
Once the votes are read, the

1091
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,278
decision is final.

1092
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,112
The person voted out will be

1093
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:04,612
asked to leave the Tribal

1094
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,114
Council area immediately.

1095
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,907
I'll read the votes.

1096
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:15,164
First vote: Rory.

1097
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:15,832
J. P.

1098
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:20,128
J. P.

1099
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,007
That's two votes J.P.

1100
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,467
Rory.

1101
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:31,639
Two votes Rory; two votes J.P.

1102
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:31,931
Rory.

1103
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,310
Three votes Rory; two votes

1104
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,937
J.P.

1105
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,648
Tied.

1106
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,733
Three votes J P.

1107
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,986
Three votes Rory.

1108
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,070
Four votes J.P.

1109
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:50,742
Three votes Rory.

1110
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:55,955
Last vote.

1111
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,165
Third person voted out of

1112
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,793
Survivor: Vanuatu, J.P.

1113
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,463
Please bring me your torch.

1114
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:15,183
J. P., the tribe has spoken.

1115
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,227
It's time for you to go.

1116
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,285
Well, both times, you guys have

1117
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,453
been to Tribal Council, the

1118
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,954
consensus has been that the vote

1119
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,456
was based on keeping the tribe

1120
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,749
strong.

1121
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,833
You voted out two of your

1122
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,918
strongest members.

1123
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:42,377
Interesting strategy.

1124
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,045
See if it works.

1125
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,213
John, you'll stay behind for the

1126
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,339
next Tribal Council.

1127
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,382
The rest of you guys take your

1128
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,425
torches with you back to camp.

1129
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,469
Good night.

1130
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,516
>> Well, what can I say?

1131
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,809
I survived seven days.

1132
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,102
I was hoping to stay a little

1133
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,770
bit longer, but there's no way

1134
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,314
that I think I was outwitted,

1135
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,274
outlasted, outplayed.

1136
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,401
Coming to the island and being

1137
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,652
part of something that I

1138
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,320
couldn't even imagine, I'll tell

1139
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,115
you, what an experience.

1140
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,428
>> PROBST: Welcome back to

1141
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,595
Tribal Council.

1142
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,513
Lopevi has already voted

1143
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,764
somebody out.

1144
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,849
John is staying behind because,

1145
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,058
as you know, he's going to award

1146
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,477
one of you his immunity necklace

1147
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,562
which will make you safe from

1148
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,397
the vote tonight.

1149
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,857
You know who you're going to

1150
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,566
give it to?

1151
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,151
>> Yeah.

1152
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,165
>> PROBST: So, Yasur, one of you

1153
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,082
is about to become immune from

1154
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,418
the vote.

1155
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,463
John, give it up.

1156
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,187
Why Ami?

1157
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:24,604
>> Because, out of

1158
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,856
everyone there, she was not

1159
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,982
getting voted off tonight no

1160
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,108
matter what-- and I think you

1161
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,818
guys need to figure out who you

1162
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,945
want to vote out.

1163
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,405
And because I picked her, it's

1164
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,198
probably going to be who it was

1165
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,283
going to be anyway, and you'll

1166
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:37,909
figure out a lot about your own

1167
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,827
tribe, because you guys are two

1168
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,662
sides.

1169
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,497
Grab your torch...

1170
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,122
>> Take it easy, guys.

1171
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,374
>> PROBST: ... find the rest of

1172
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:45,958
your tribe.

1173
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:46,876
>> Bye, John.

1174
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:47,418
>> Bye, John.

1175
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:54,342
>> PROBST: Good night.

1176
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,719
Ami, surprised?

1177
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,221
>> A little surprised, yeah.

1178
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,097
I thought that he would put it

1179
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,182
on someone's head that he

1180
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,683
thought might get voted out

1181
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,142
tonight.

1182
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,269
>> PROBST: Scout, you leave here

1183
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,147
after a very surprising vote to

1184
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,316
a lot of people.

1185
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,317
You go back to camp.

1186
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,276
It's a tough night.

1187
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,277
You get up in the morning, and

1188
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,655
what happens?

1189
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,405
>> It was obvious that

1190
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,573
Mia was a little pissed off at

1191
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,242
the vote, didn't understand it.

1192
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,701
This morning, when they got up,

1193
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,203
Twila and Mia really got into

1194
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:22,370
it.

1195
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,329
>> PROBST: Mia, what's your

1196
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,997
take?

1197
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:25,540
>> It had nothing really to

1198
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,083
do about the vote.

1199
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,376
It just had to do about Twila's

1200
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,461
comments about the young ones

1201
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,212
not doing anything, not pulling

1202
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,213
their weight.

1203
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,882
And it really did upset me, so I

1204
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,424
confronted her about it this

1205
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,343
morning.

1206
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,261
>> PROBST: Twila, did you make a

1207
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,012
comment about workload?

1208
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,931
>> She was offended by

1209
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,766
what I said last night at Tribal

1210
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,600
Council.

1211
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,185
I don't know why I offended her

1212
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,396
so bad, but I just said what I

1213
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:48,563
felt.

1214
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,148
I felt like I was telling the

1215
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:51,774
truth.

1216
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,483
>> PROBST: Julie, what's the

1217
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,651
result of that?

1218
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,527
>> I think it goes a

1219
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,112
little deeper than the comment.

1220
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:56,737
Speaking for myself, I haven't

1221
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,906
felt like Twila's made any

1222
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,284
effort to communicate or build

1223
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,036
anything with me, so, you know,

1224
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,122
without that bridge, it's

1225
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,415
frustrating, and I think Mia got

1226
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,249
frustrated.

1227
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,126
>> They haven't given me

1228
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,002
an opportunity to talk to them.

1229
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:11,961
I mean, why would I want to walk

1230
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,254
up to somebody that rolls their

1231
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,881
eyes at me all the time and acts

1232
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,007
like they can't stand to be

1233
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:16,549
around me?

1234
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,758
Why would I even want to try?

1235
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,801
>> Twila, you talk to me in

1236
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,177
one-word answers.

1237
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:20,928
I'm not going to try to pull a

1238
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:21,721
conversation out of you.

1239
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,221
>> That's just my

1240
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,222
personality, and that's just how

1241
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,056
I am.

1242
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,515
>> You have plenty of

1243
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,350
conversations with everybody

1244
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,894
else except for a couple of us.

1245
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:28,728
>> I just communicate

1246
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,730
better with men than I do women.

1247
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,690
I always have, always will.

1248
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,900
I am the tomboy.

1249
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,650
I do weld.

1250
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,193
I do fix trucks.

1251
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,445
I do those things.

1252
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,821
And it's hard for me to bring up

1253
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,615
conversation with these women

1254
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,741
that I feel I have nothing in

1255
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,950
common with.

1256
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,951
You know, until you walk in

1257
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,036
somebody else's shoes, don't

1258
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:45,620
judge.

1259
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,662
>> Have you taken the time

1260
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,288
to walk in these girls' shoes

1261
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,414
and realize they're just girls?

1262
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,291
They like to play on the beach.

1263
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,335
They like to do girly stuff.

1264
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,836
Like, have you taken that time?

1265
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,463
>> No, I haven't.

1266
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:55,963
I'll be honest with you.

1267
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,881
I haven't.

1268
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,757
>> Do you realize that

1269
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,674
right now is your opportunity

1270
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,176
to, like, find the feminine side

1271
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:00,801
of you and just let go of "this

1272
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,346
is what I am" and realize

1273
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,680
there's so much more to you than

1274
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,681
just that?

1275
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,766
There is a wonderful,

1276
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:07,767
feminine...

1277
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,768
>> Maybe I don't have a

1278
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,769
feminine side to me, I don't

1279
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,186
know.

1280
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,187
>> Yes, you do.

1281
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,188
Just say, "you know what?

1282
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:12,980
Will you guys French-braid my

1283
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,648
hair tomorrow?

1284
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,273
Will one of you French..."

1285
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,107
you know?

1286
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,108
Something silly like that.

1287
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,985
I know, it sounds crazy.

1288
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,694
Give it a go.

1289
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,862
It feels nice to have someone

1290
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,656
else French-braid your hair.

1291
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,282
>> I can try that.

1292
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:23,824
We can start with the hair.

1293
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,242
That'd be working.

1294
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,702
Even do my nails, too, while

1295
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,370
you're at it, would you?

1296
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,497
Yeah, that'd be great.

1297
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,499
That'd be great.

1298
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,291
>> PROBST: Scout, what are you

1299
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,086
basing your vote on tonight?

1300
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,545
>> Maintaining a healthy,

1301
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,424
emotional attitude in camp.

1302
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,343
>> PROBST: Your vote tonight is

1303
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,803
to get rid of somebody that you

1304
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,345
think is causing disharmony,

1305
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,138
chaos, problems.

1306
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,014
>> Yeah, chaos, agitation,

1307
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,808
disharmony, yeah.

1308
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,059
>> PROBST: Mia, you're shaking

1309
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:50,685
your head, rolling your eyes,

1310
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,435
closing your eyes.

1311
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,270
You're like the little doggie in

1312
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,271
the window.

1313
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,856
>> I feel like Scout's

1314
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,108
statement is definitely pointed

1315
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,026
toward me and the disharmony was

1316
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,403
our fight today.

1317
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,404
And I think it was on both

1318
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,072
sides, so I don't see where I'm

1319
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,032
causing emotional distress in

1320
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,993
the tribe at all.

1321
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:07,785
>> PROBST: Eliza, decided who

1322
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,286
you're voting for?

1323
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,413
>> I think Scout's

1324
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,123
statement about disharmony is a

1325
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,874
good one, but if I had the

1326
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,084
choice to keep everyone here I

1327
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,502
definitely would.

1328
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,837
>> PROBST: With that, it is time

1329
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,796
to vote.

1330
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,588
Ami is the only person you

1331
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,589
cannot vote for.

1332
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,174
Everybody else is fair game.

1333
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,845
Mia, you're up.

1334
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,019
>> Twila, I'm voting for you.

1335
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,062
You said you can't relate to

1336
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:35,688
women, and, unfortunately, you

1337
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,440
got stuck on an all women's

1338
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,274
tribe.

1339
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:38,899
I don't want to spend another

1340
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,568
day on the island with you.

1341
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,536
>> Mia, your volcano

1342
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,538
erupts more than I like.

1343
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,874
Good luck in finding a husband

1344
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,917
that will put up with you.

1345
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:09,847
>> I think you're a young

1346
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,474
woman that's got a big chip on

1347
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,725
her shoulder.

1348
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,268
I think that you got a mouth-

1349
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:14,894
and-a-half and I think you need

1350
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,604
to go.

1351
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,647
That's all.

1352
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,115
>> Twila, my vote's for you.

1353
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,408
I think you have an amazing work

1354
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,160
ethic, but you can't be here

1355
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,037
anymore.

1356
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,833
Sorry.

1357
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,460
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1358
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,379
votes.

1359
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,015
Once the votes are read, the

1360
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,225
decision is final.

1361
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,142
The person voted out will be

1362
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:55,810
asked to leave the Tribal

1363
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,394
Council area immediately.

1364
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,731
I'll read the votes.

1365
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:05,319
First vote: Twila.

1366
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,321
Mia.

1367
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:10,991
One vote Twila; one vote Mia.

1368
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,618
Twila.

1369
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:16,497
Two votes Twila; one vote Mia.

1370
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,083
Mia.

1371
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:24,463
Two votes Mia; two votes Twila.

1372
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,798
Mia.

1373
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,507
That's three votes Mia; two

1374
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,553
votes Twila.

1375
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,972
Twila.

1376
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:33,472
You're tied.

1377
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,643
Three votes Twila; three votes

1378
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,271
Mia.

1379
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,605
That's four votes Mia; three

1380
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,773
votes Twila.

1381
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:47,570
One vote left.

1382
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,779
The fourth person voted out of

1383
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:53,242
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu,</i> Mia.

1384
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,287
Bring me your torch.

1385
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,547
Mia, the tribe has spoken.

1386
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,715
>> Thanks.

1387
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,216
Kick ass, ladies.

1388
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,051
>> Bye, Mia.

1389
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,191
>> PROBST: Well, if there was

1390
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:25,774
one clear theme from tonight's

1391
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,360
Tribal Council, it was that the

1392
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,362
seven of you desire to be a

1393
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,906
strong group of women with

1394
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,115
emotional harmony.

1395
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,366
The question is: did tonight's

1396
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,535
vote bring you any closer?

1397
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,161
Ami, you can leave that necklace

1398
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,454
behind.

1399
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,288
Grab your torches.

1400
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,289
Head back to camp.

<i>Survivor,</i>

the tide.

1413

1414
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,901
with the fishing, that may

1415
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,237
change people's minds.

1416

>> Give it a chance to grow up.

>> PROBST: At Yasur, old allies

1418
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,074
become new enemies.

1419
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,075
>> I didn't trust you.

1420
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,076
I had a right, and I changed my

1421
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,619
mind.

1422
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,828
I'm not going to be

1423
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,204
confrontational.

1424
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,789
>> That bitch.

1425
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,295
>> I've met a lot of

1426
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,463
amazing girls and a lot of

1427
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,089
people that I'd like to never

1428
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,091
see again, one of those being

1429
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:32,591
Twila.

1430
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,676
Um, Twila, you have been

1431
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,844
extremely deceiving with all the

1432
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:36,595
girls.

1433
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,596
I thought you were absolutely

1434
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,390
horrendous to me, and I think

1435
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,766
that you did not have the social

1436
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,184
skills to play this game at all,

1437
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,560
and that's going to wear on the

1438
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,561
girls, um, and hopefully you'll

1439
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,647
get voted off next.
