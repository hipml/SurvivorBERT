00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,752
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:03,962
Survivor, Lydia was relieved

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,088
she had been spared at Tribal

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:05,797
Council.

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,257
>> You know, I don't deserve to

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,424
go.

7
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,133
I'm a hard worker.

8
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,635
So, you know, I'm happy that I'm

9
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,636
here.

10
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,595
>> PROBST: At the reward

11
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,722
challenge, the tribes played for

12
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,097
comfort items.

13
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,641
Survivors ready.

14
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,851
Go.

15
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,394
Yaxha started with a solid lead.

16
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,353
Take off your blindfolds!

17
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,479
Start assembling.

18
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,814
>> Girls on tie, boys build.

19
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,815
>> PROBST: But Nakum made up

20
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:24,441
time when they discovered how to

21
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,193
correctly assemble their tent.

22
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,697
Nakum wins reward!

23
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,073
(cheering)

24
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,325
Back at camp, the guys struggled

25
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,286
with how best to use their new

26
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,412
tarp.

27
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,163
So Margaret spoke up.

28
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,415
>> If you're going to slant it,

29
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,624
you got to decide which way you

30
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,625
want to slant it.

31
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,835
>> PROBST: And Bobby Jon and

32
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:44,836
Judd got annoyed.

33
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:45,962
>> I'm 28 years old.

34
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,630
You just can't tell grown men

35
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,256
what to do all the time.

36
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,215
>> She's playing that mother hen

37
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,050
role.

38
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,260
>> PROBST: At Yaxha, Brian

39
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:52,677
pumped up his team.

40
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,303
>> We got it, guys! We need it.

41
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,346
We're the underdogs.

42
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,264
Do it for your family, do it for

43
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,390
whatever, do it for each other.

44
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,099
Just do it!

45
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,392
And win, guys!

46
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,477
>> PROBST: At the immunity

47
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,811
challenge, the tribes competed

48
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,688
in an ancient Maya court ball

49
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,147
game.

50
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,778
Temperature update: 114 degrees.

51
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,278
Yaxha struggled when Amy

52
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,947
sprained her ankle and Brianna

53
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:13,490
and Lydia couldn't pull it

54
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,200
together.

55
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,159
>> Why don't you move it!

56
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,452
I want to see some hustle.

57
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,536
>> PROBST: Nakum won their

58
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,954
second immunity in a row.

59
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,206
Danni scores!

60
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,125
Nakum wins immunity.

61
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,752
Back at Yaxha, Steph was

62
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,544
discouraged.

63
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,295
>> I'm frustrated because we

64
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,631
have Amy, she can't run.

65
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,090
And we have a fish monger.

66
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,091
And we have Brianna, who is a

67
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,009
makeup artist.

68
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,302
Why, just once, can't I just be

69
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,846
on a great tribe?

70
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,472
>> PROBST: With Lydia, Amy and

71
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,141
Brianna all at risk, the tribe

72
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,726
ultimately voted out the one

73
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,603
they considered the weakest.

74
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,397
Brianna, the tribe has spoken.

75
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,565
15 are left.

76
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,275
Who will be voted off tonight?

77
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,446
(theme song playing)

78
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,447
Captioning sponsored by

79
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,448
CBS PARAMOUNT

NETWORK TELEVISION

81
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,601
(birds chirping)

82
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,374
>> Being here is the hottest

83
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,376
conditions I've ever been in in

84
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,419
my life.

85
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,503
Hotter than I could possibly

86
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,505
imagine.

87
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,381
I mean, we're talking triple

88
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,341
digits every day, and it seems

89
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,759
like every day it goes up a

90
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,385
couple of digits more.

91
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,386
Just when you think like 104,

92
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,388
holy crap, that is the hottest

93
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,806
I could possibly imagine,

94
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,558
the next day it's 114.

95
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,106
>> I tell you, you take the heat

96
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,690
and you get near a fire, it's

97
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,274
even worse.

98
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,402
>> Uh-huh.

99
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,322
>> The tribe's pretty tired.

100
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,407
We're weak after yesterday's

101
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,825
challenge.

102
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,619
It was like nothing we had ever

103
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,121
dreamed of.

104
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,456
Heat absolutely wiped us out.

105
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,416
It's brutal.

106
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,668
And you can't do anything.

107
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,128
You're sapped of energy.

108
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,964
And the mosquitoes are

109
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,925
unbelievable.

110
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,096
>> I've never seen anything like

111
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,973
the bugs in my life.

112
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,723
In my entire...

113
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,599
you know what?

114
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,392
They just, it's like you ever

115
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,269
watch<i> The Killer Bees,</i> the

116
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,104
movie?

117
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,522
They're all over you.

118
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,606
I mean, they're literally, if I

119
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,607
didn't have my sweatshirt on,

120
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,901
forget about it.

121
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,527
>> We were smacking and kind of

122
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,363
fight sparring in the wind, man,

123
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,406
just trying to get the

124
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,282
mosquitoes out of there, but it

125
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,283
ain't gonna work, man.

126
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,660
It only works for about maybe a

127
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,369
millimeter of a second.

128
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,371
Then the thing goes and he's

129
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,498
right back at you.

130
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,416
>> I know, man, we have a bunch

131
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,251
of bites.

132
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,129
>> They're brutal today.

133
00:04:56,212 --> 00:05:00,174
>> Yeah, this, this place

134
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,592
changes you out here.

135
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,137
I mean, between starving and the

136
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,638
heat and mosquitoes and bugs,

137
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,724
everything adds up, and it just,

138
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,725
you know, completely wears you

139
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,935
down.

140
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,979
So I find it's just easier to

141
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,690
lay around and do nothing.

142
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,899
I guess, which is kind of

143
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,401
pathetic, but, I don't know,

144
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,778
we're still on top, you know.

145
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,113
We're beating the other team.

146
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,614
I mean, I can't imagine how the

147
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,574
other team feels if we're not

148
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,534
feeling very well.

149
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,244
I mean, God knows what it's like

150
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:32,457
around their place.

151
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,834
>> Now, that's the method we

152
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,544
need to start using.

153
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:36,753
>> Oops.

154
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,420
>> It's going down.

155
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,130
>> Quick, quick, quick.

156
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,256
>> I got him.

157
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:40,590
>> There we go.

158
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,967
>> How many you have total?

159
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,677
>> Four so far.

160
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,346
>> Whoa!

161
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,222
>> There's the ticket right

162
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,224
there.

163
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,517
>> So the method for today was

164
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,020
sit this big pot down in the

165
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,313
water that had all the cornmeal

166
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,315
in it.

167
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,608
And then all the minnows swarm

168
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,442
inside of it in a big circle.

169
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,526
And then you pull it out

170
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,820
really fast and at least a

171
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,988
couple of them are still in

172
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:04,739
there.

173
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,740
>> I saw it, I saw it.

174
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,159
There he is.

175
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:08,659
They hide in the bottom.

176
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,453
>> Basically, we're a finally

177
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,662
tuned fishing machine.

178
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,581
Gary and I, there's no stopping

179
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,832
us.

180
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,918
These minnows are in trouble.

181
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,466
>> Oh, my God!

182
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,927
>> Looks like a croc, if you ask

183
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,928
me.

184
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,637
>> I'd say you're right.

185
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,429
>> I think it probably is.

186
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,431
>> Wow!

187
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,058
>> We were all down

188
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,059
at the dock, and we look out

189
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,854
into the flat lake, and all of a

190
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,940
sudden, we see this huge croc,

191
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,900
and he seemed pretty long.

192
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,734
>> He's coming this way.

193
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,944
>> Oh.

194
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,571
>> Oh, my God!

195
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,242
It's the Loch Ness Monster.

196
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,077
(gasps)

197
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,870
>> Wow!

198
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,913
>> He went and suddenly

199
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,206
he caught a fish and we saw that

200
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,583
big mouth eat it.

201
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,210
We were like, uh-oh, that could

202
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,920
have been one of us if we were

203
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,756
swimming across its path.

204
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,893
>> Ow!

205
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,727
>> What?

206
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,106
>> A fish got me.

207
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:40,168
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

208
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,545
Nakum getting your first look at

209
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,548
the new Yaxha tribe.

210
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,841
Brianna voted out at the last

211
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,551
Tribal Council.

212
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,761
Take a seat on the bench.

213
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,596
Well, it's day nine and you guys

214
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,098
have endured arguably the

215
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,309
toughest<i> Survivor</i> ever.

216
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:56,851
So you've earned a little

217
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,685
relief.

218
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,770
Today we're going to give you a

219
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,522
break from the challenges, and

220
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,565
instead give you a chance to

221
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,234
learn a little bit about what

222
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,611
your tribe mates think about

223
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,570
you.

224
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,613
At the same time, you'll gain a

225
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,031
little insight into the other

226
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:10,823
tribe.

227
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,991
I'm going to ask you a series of

228
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,034
questions about your tribe

229
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,368
mates.

230
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,786
You'll write your answers down,

231
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,038
reveal them to me.

232
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,040
Keep in mind each answer will

233
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,167
have a direct effect on those

234
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,585
tribe mates.

235
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,003
Make sense?

236
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,254
Let's get started.

237
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,381
First question: which tribe

238
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,051
member is most in need of some

239
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:30,635
nourishment?

240
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,221
You cannot vote for yourself.

241
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,639
I know everybody's hungry, but

242
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,807
which tribe member in particular

243
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,643
most needs some nourishment?

244
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,812
All right, reveal.

245
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,814
Yaxha is almost a slam dunk for

246
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,566
Jamie as most in need of some

247
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,151
nourishment.

248
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,028
For Nakum, everybody voting for

249
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,071
Danni.

250
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,198
Danni, Jamie, come on up.

251
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,242
>> Oh.

252
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,704
(all sigh)

253
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,872
>> PROBST: They're yours.

254
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,122
Dig in.

255
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:00,665
Take a bite.

256
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,709
>> Whoo-hoo!

257
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,503
>> PROBST: It's not a race.

258
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,379
It's yours.

259
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,255
>> Mmm.

260
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:07,755
>> Go ahead, Jamie.

261
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,007
You deserve it.

262
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:10,758
>> PROBST: All right.

263
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,343
Next question: which tribe

264
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,638
member is the smelliest?

265
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,473
Who smells the worst on your

266
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,516
tribe?

267
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,892
That's got to be a tough one.

268
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,644
Margaret says, nope, easy.

269
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,437
Let's reveal.

270
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,941
For Yaxha, we have three Jamies

271
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,609
and four Garys.

272
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,819
All right.

273
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,279
Gary gets designated the

274
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,530
smelliest.

275
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,990
And for Nakum, we have four

276
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,074
Bobby Jons.

277
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,117
That's enough.

278
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,576
Bobby Jon and Gary, come

279
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,953
forward.

280
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,246
>> Go get it, Gar.

281
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,622
>> PROBST: What I have for you

282
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:46,752
two is right over there.

283
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,089
Five gallons of fresh water and

284
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,382
a bush shower.

285
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,801
>> Oh, my God!

286
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,012
>> Nice backbones there, guys.

287
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,640
>> PROBST: Gary not wasting any

288
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,725
water.

289
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,350
>> There's shampoo there, Bobby

290
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:01,684
Jon.

291
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,352
>> Use all that soap.

292
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,229
>> Don't romance it, sweetheart.

293
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,230
>> Oh, he's scrubbing.

294
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,273
Look at the lather.

295
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,566
>> Oh, man.

296
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,067
>> Use all that soap.

297
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,152
>> PROBST: Margaret, you got

298
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:11,986
shower envy.

299
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,113
>> Oh, my God, I do.

300
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,031
>> Gary, we're going to

301
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,282
be smelling you all night, just

302
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,576
sniffing.

303
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,535
>> PROBST: I can't say you look

304
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:19,910
a lot different.

305
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,329
>> Thanks, guys.

306
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,583
Yo, baby-- mmm!

307
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,668
>> PROBST: Next question: from

308
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,630
your tribe, which man and which

309
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,258
woman most deserves a picnic

310
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,719
afternoon atop an ancient Maya

311
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,555
pyramid, returning to their camp

312
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,474
later this afternoon?

313
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,101
Put down one woman and one man.

314
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,978
Reveal.

315
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,897
For Yaxha, it looks like it is

316
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,815
Gary.

317
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,983
The man.

318
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,860
And we have Amy, the woman.

319
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,572
For Nakum, we have Margaret.

320
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,865
For the men, it looks like it is

321
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,075
Judd.

322
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,077
>> Yes, thank you, man.

323
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,952

324
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,622
on up.

325
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,498
Amy, you look like you're going

326
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,415
to cry.

327
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:06,957
>> What is it, a tarantula?

328
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,918
>> PROBST: I wouldn't do that to

329
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,879
you.

330
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,713
>> Oh, my God!

331
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,592
(cheering, sobbing)

332
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,470
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

chip cookies, and iced tea.

336
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,686
You guys have been rewarded with

337
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,813
a nice picnic.

338
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,897
Eat it all.

339
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,107
You can't bring it back.

340
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,566
There's no burden on you.

341
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,527
>> Guys, man, I love you,

342
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,028

people remaining, which tribe

345
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,452
member has the most tribe pride?

346
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,371
Who just bleeds Yaxha blue?

347
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,332
Who bleeds Nakum yellow?

348
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,419
Who has the most tribe pride?

349
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,879
Okay, reveal.

350
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,881
Yaxha, it is three votes Brian,

So, Brian, you have the most

358
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,230
tribe pride for Yaxha.

359
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,523
It's only fitting you remain a

360
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:12,982
Yaxha member.

361
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,068
>> Oh, my God.

362
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,111

You are now members of Nakum.

368
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,581
You're switching tribes.

369
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,082
Come on up, get a buff, have a

370
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,627
spot on the Nakum mat.

371
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,421
Cindy, meet your new tribe

372
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:35,921
members.

373
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,840
>> Hey, Cindy.

374
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,924
>> PROBST: Now Nakum, because

375
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,302

of you will remain a Nakum

377
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,012
member.

378
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,598
The other four will join Brian

379
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,641
on the Yaxha tribe.

380
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,268
There are five buffs here.

381
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,270
One of them is Nakum yellow.

382
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,563
You're going to draw to decide

383
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,481
your fate.

384
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,398
You decide who draws and what

385
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,191
order.

386
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,944
It's up to you.

387
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,198
Danni fields blue.

388
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,116
You're now a member of Yaxha.

389
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,201
Who's next?

390
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:10,080
Brooke, choose your fate.

391
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:10,915
You stay with Nakum.

392
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,000
That settles the rest of it.

393
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,170
Bobby Jon, Blake, Brandon,

394
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,963
you're all now members of Yaxha.

395
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,048
Gary and Amy will be returning

396
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,759
to the Yaxha camp later for a

397
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,636
bit of a surprise.

398
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,638
Nakum, Judd and Margaret will be

399
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,431
returning to your tribe, also in

400
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,350
for a bit of a surprise.

401
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,809
Head on back to camp.

402
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,688
Get to know each other.

403
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,452
>> Wow, man!

404
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,621
Top of the world.

405
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,080
>> How about a toast?

406
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,415
Guys, to Guatemala.

407
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,083
>> Yes.

408
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,336
(indistinct chatter)

409
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,337
>> The location of this

410
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,213
picnic was great.

411
00:13:59,296 --> 00:13:59,922
We were above this whole area

412
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,757
here.

413
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,633
We could see everything, the

414
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,467
whole lake.

415
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,677
You could see, I'm going to

416
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,012
guess, 30 miles.

417
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,305
>> Oh, my God!

418
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,306
It's so good.

419
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,100
Oh, wow!

420
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:11,934
>> Where are you from,

421
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,935
Amy?

422
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,478
>> Boston.

423
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,062
>> Are you?

424
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,188
We were trying to guess your

425
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:16,438
accent.

426
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,023
It was either New York or

427
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:18,899
Boston.

428
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,608
>> Boston.

429
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,442
>> That's what we were figuring

430
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:20,609
out.

431
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,944
And we think you're a

432
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,695
policewoman.

433
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,612
And you're an ex-football

434
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,238
player?

435
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,906
>> No, I'm a landscaper.

436
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,032
>> Are you really?

437
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,033
>> Did Danni say something about

438
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,202
being a football player?

439
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,663
>> She said you looked familiar.

440
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,747
>> I wish I was.

441
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,290
>> Margaret was asking Gary

442
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,418
a question about pro football.

443
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,711
Who knows, watch him be retired

444
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,837
and he's like a

445
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,796
multimillionaire.

446
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,423
I'll kill him.

447
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,425
I'll freaking kill him.

448
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,593
>> Oh, that was good.

449
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,051
I needed that, man.

450
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,137
>> I feel so guilty, though.

451
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,606
>> We just got back from

452
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,065
the reward challenge, which

453
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,108
wasn't so much challenge as it

454
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,403
was swap up the tribes.

455
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,780
There's our flag right up there.

456
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,449
>> Hey, we have fruit.

457
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,617
Lookit!

458
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,534
Yeah!

459
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,077
Welcome.

460
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,414
Welcome, Danni.

461
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,126
(indistinct chatter)

462
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:19,501
>> Welcome, man.

463
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,919
Nice to have you guys.

464
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:21,879
You guys are tough.

465
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,130
>> So I was getting the feel,

466
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,214
you know, who they were,

467
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,215
showing them around the new

468
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,216
tribe, playing host, and being

469
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,217
like I'm so glad I have you

470
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,218
guys.

471
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,887
This is great.

472
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,512
Guys who are new to Yaxha, I'm

473
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,056
with you guys.

474
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:32,389
We're awesome.

475
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,516
We're going to win.

476
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,142
>> You like mad dog?

477
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:35,976
>> I haven't been tired yet.

478
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,518
A lot of other people in my

479
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,270
tribe have felt tired.

480
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,146
>> Don't overwork yourself,

481
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,105
though, dude.

482
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,023
We need to save ourselves for

483
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,650
those challenges.

484
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,400
>> No, you're right.

485
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,276
That's why you guys are winning.

486
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,527
>> The thing that sucks is that

487
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,820
there are four Nakum on our new

488
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,989
tribe and three Yaxha.

489
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,157
If it's a numbers game, they

490
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,367
could easily pick us off one by

491
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,368
one.

492
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,994
So I was like, Oh, my God, what

493
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,247
am I doing with four new people?

494
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,958
Is that Amy down there?

495
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,711
Amy, Gary, welcome back, guys.

496
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,630
There's water over here with the

497
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,048
rest of our team.

498
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,091
>> What?

499
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,217
>> Here's Johnny.

500
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,552
>> Hey, hey.

501
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,762
What's going on?

502
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,431
>> Get the ... out of here.

503
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,308
What the ... is going on?

504
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,184
Is this a joke?

505
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,185
>> We're Yaxha.

506
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,853
Thanks for having me.

507
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,521
>> Hey, what's up?

508
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,523
>> They switched us up.

509
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,692
>> I was like completely

510
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,901
blown away.

511
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,862
Hey, what's up, guys?

512
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,988
Hey, nice to meet you.

513
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,990
I'm looking at Gary.

514
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,827
I'm, like, we're decimated here,

515
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,495
decimated!

516
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,996
Gone!

517
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,123
>> Commercial real estate.

518
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,499
Farmer.

519
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,251
Waiter.

520
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,252
What do you do?

521
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,294
>> No football?

522
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,587
>> Landscaper.

523
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,005
Who did you think I was?

524
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:47,631
>> Oh, I thought you played for

525
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,091
Central Michigan.

526
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,134
>> I went to Central Michigan,

527
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,135
but I didn't play there.

528
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,305
>> No? Oh.

529
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,515
>> I thought Gary was gonna die

530
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,725
when he looked at me, because

531
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,934
I called him out right away

532
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,936
on the whole quarterback thing.

533
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:01,478
I don't know, maybe he just

534
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,105
doesn't want anybody to know he

535
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,440
was a former professional

536
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,107
quarterback because, you know,

537
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,066
you think right away, he doesn't

538
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,068
need the money.

539
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,069
>> Where you from?

540
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,614
>> Kansas.

541
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,949
>> I'm totally gonna deny

542
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,242
that I'm Gary Hoogebum until the

543
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,869
end.

544
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,413
I'm not going to blow my

545
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,707
strategy, and that's my cover.

546
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,918
So I'm keeping it.

547
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,716
>> How are you all doing?

548
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,342
>> Hi, guys.

549
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,385
>> What are you guys doing over

550
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,344
here?

551
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,137
>> There's been a little team

552
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,345
mix-up.

553
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,182
>> No way, no way.

554
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,434
No way.

555
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,770
>> Yeah.

556
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,480
>> Oh, my God!

557
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,692
>> Oh, my gosh.

558
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,568
>> Oh, yeah.

559
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,277
>> I thought you guys

560
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,278
were just sitting here for a

561
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,237
picnic.

562
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,238
>> You came over and I was

563
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,449
like why is she so surprised.

564
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,284
>> I'm like, we have company.

565
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,954
(indistinct conversations)

566
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,372
>> It's all we can do, man.

567
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,916
You know what I'm saying?

568
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,126
>> They have more men.

569
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,169
>> With this switch-up today, I

570
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,879
don't feel safe at all.

571
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,006
Not at all.

572
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:13,509
>> Damn, this is the first time

573
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,554
it rained.

574
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,765
>> My head and my stomach

575
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,433
are so mixed up right now,

576
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,268
with everything that's

577
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,938
happened today, I'm trying

578
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,564
frantically to scramble in my

579
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,233
head to see, you know, what

580
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,111
we're going to do.

581
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,572
I think the old Nakum tribe,

582
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,326
myself, Cindy, Brooke, and Judd,

583
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,744
is going to stick together with

584
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,912
the old Nakum tribe.

585
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,206
But who knows what Yaxha can do?

586
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,500
It's still four against four.

587
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,710
So, food is in our belly.

588
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,504
There's been a major turnover,

589
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,672
and game is on.

590
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,467
(thunder rumbling)

591
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,176
>> I thought they were

592
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,219
just visiting.

593
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:57,636
>> I was just like,

594
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,220
whatever, man.

595
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,097
I don't give a crap.

596
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,722
>> I know I was shocked, but my

597
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,224
stomach is like...

598
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,268
>> But honestly, when I first

599
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,602
saw these people back at camp,

600
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,771
I was like, ah, whatever.

601
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,314
Who cares?

602
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,358
Tribes have been switched, man.

603
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,110
It's great, I love it, man.

604
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,278
It didn't bother me at the least

605
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,195
bit.

606
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,280
I know it bothered Margaret, and

607
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,322
Margaret's still walking on

608
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,492
eggshells, man.

609
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,244
I'm just glad that I'm not

610
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,204
involved with all those other

611
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:24,454
guys, man.

612
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,707
I mean, we had Bobby Jon.

613
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,916
We had Blake.

614
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,043
We had Brandon and me, which was

615
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,880
kind of, you know, a male

616
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,338
testosterone thing.

617
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,757
Now over here, man, I know I'm

618
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,925
the big gun around here, man.

619
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,801
I know it.

620
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,011
You feel like you're King Kong,

621
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,346
man.

622
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,640
Ah, feeling good, baby.

623
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:48,478
(roaring)

624
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,443
>> What's her name?

625
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,904
What's that girl...?

626
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,447
>> Brooke.

627
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,781
She's cool and everything, but

628
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,241
she's not an athlete.

629
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,660
Want to get rid of her?

630
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,078
>> We could try to start with

631
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,039
her if we had to.

632
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,916
They're down in numbers.

633
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,417
If we can keep us four tight,

634
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,460
we really need to.

635
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,378
>> I bet Brooke is better than

636
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,589
Lydia is at stuff.

637
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,924
>> I know.

638
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,176
But as soon as we get rid of

639
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,677
Lydia, if we have to, they could

640
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,095
get rid of us one by one.

641
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,096
>> I know.

642
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,014
>> We're going to push for

643
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,599
Brooke so we can keep the old

644
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,934
Yaxha together, just in case,

645
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,186
just to always have the numbers

646
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,437
and keep Lydia around just

647
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,605
because she is a hard worker.

648
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,522
>> Let's just let them approach

649
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,523
us.

650
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,483
>> Okay.

651
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,484
>> Okay? 'Cause you don't want

652
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:35,817
to be too pushy.

653
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,194
Because then people back away.

654
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,362
>> Judd told me, he goes, I'm

655
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,363
with you, man, he goes, I got

656
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,322
your back.

657
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,448
>> Yeah.

658
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,283
And Judd's from Jersey.

659
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,284
We know a lot of the same kind

660
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,327
of things.

661
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,662
>> We connect.

662
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,371
Okay, we'll see what's up.

663
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,289
Yeah.

664
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,208
>> Hey, Judd.

665
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,543
>> Yeah.

666
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,836
>> Jimmy, the first guy

667
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,797
that went out, threw out his

668
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,006
bicep?

669
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,675
He never got to come up here.

670
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,093
>> Oh, really?

671
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,636
>> Yeah, he couldn't make it up

672
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,054
here.

673
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,013
>> Who's the strongest girl?

674
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,515
Margaret, right?

675
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,266
>> Yeah, she's strong.

676
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,019
Cindy's tough.

677
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,561
>> The two weakest we see is

678
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,396
Brooke and Lydia.

679
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,355
>> Who's your strongest?

680
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,439
>> Who are you like tighter

681
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,566
with, Cindy or Margaret?

682
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,401
Like, if we were to like...

683
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,278
>> It's hard to say, you know, I

684
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,864
can see you guys, I'm kind of

685
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,700
more personable already with you

686
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,452
than I am with any of the girls

687
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,412
that I was on my team with.

688
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,454
I don't know.

689
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,498
>> Right.

690
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,457
>> It just didn't kind of click.

691
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,083
>> You know when you have like a

692
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,042
natural click.

693
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,043
>> Yeah, you can feel it.

694
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,669
You can see it.

695
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,795
It's all just natural.

696
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,587
>> That's what I was

697
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,338
saying to Jamie.

698
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,381
I'm obviously sticking with you.

699
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,382
Got to stick with the strongest.

700
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,510
>> I mean, I'm-- like I said,

701
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,970
man, I'm all with you guys, man.

702
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,680
If it goes this way, we get

703
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,182
rid of, uh, we get rid of...

704
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,267
>> We get rid of Brooke

705
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,269
and we get Lydia.

706
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:52,894
Then we can get rid of Margaret

707
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,353
or Cindy.

708
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,147
Then we've got Rafe.

709
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,106
Rafe will vote whatever we say

710
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:56,940
to vote.

711
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,066
>> Yeah, Rafe will do

712
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,734
whatever we do.

713
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,484
>> Yeah.

714
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,485
>> So it's kind of hard,

715
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,069
though, because we're still in

716
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,529
that newlywed type phase.

717
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,865
We're like...

718
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,782
>> Still learning.

719
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,117
>> You don't go a day without

720
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,826
talking.

721
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,244
>> I'm all for that, man.

722
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,412
Like I said, I'm basically, now,

723
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,205
this is the game.

724
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,540
The game's started.

725
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,458
>> Yeah.

726
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,709
>> Here I come, you know?

727
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,586
I mean, I like where I'm sitting

728
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,836
right now.

729
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,797
I feel-- feel very good, man.

730
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,798
Me and Stephenie and Jamie hit

731
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,799
it off already.

732
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,842
I think we got a little alliance

733
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:24,843
going.

734
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,844
We're not eating the peel right

735
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,845
now.

736
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:27,846
>> Yeah, I am.

737
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:28,847
>> Oh, you eat the peel?

738
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,849
I have no problem talking to my

739
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,267
old tribe, man.

740
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,268
I really don't, because I didn't

741
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:33,810
feel the love, man.

742
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,770
I didn't feel the love there at

743
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,771
all.

744
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,480
I felt no love there.

745
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,522
So they got to go, man.

746
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,523
They got to get out of my

747
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,649
jungle, man.

748
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,193
Get out of my jungle right away,

749
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,611
man-- go.

750
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,655
See you later.

751
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,461
>> This new world of mine,

752
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,921
I have some concerns.

753
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:01,797
I really do.

754
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,756
I mean, look at the tribe we

755
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,590
have.

756
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,343
Bobby Jon, Blake, Brandon,

757
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:06,843
Danni.

758
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,888
There's four of them and three

759
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,098
of us.

760
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,140
They're just going to pick us

761
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,810
off, one by one.

762
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:37,916
>> Bobby and I had a

763
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,501
little bathroom break, and a

764
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:39,835
little pep talk.

765
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,669
We were like, you know what, we

766
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,546
have the four on three in this

767
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,672
camp, we have the physical team.

768
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,506
When we do lose, and it is time

769
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,842
to vote, you know, we already

770
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,217
picked the order.

771
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,468
It's Amy, Brian, and Gary out

772
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,304
the door.

773
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:55,350
>> Water's warm.

774
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,519
Let's see.

775
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,603
You got a tweaker.

776
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:58,937
It's swollen.

777
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,606
>> Oh, my God.

778
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,275
I hurt my ankle going

779
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,609
out the first round in that

780
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,610
Mayan ball game.

781
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,528
Everybody knows I have a

782
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,529
sprained ankle.

783
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,780
I'm not sure if they know how

784
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,614
bad it is.

785
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,198
You know, I'm trying not to

786
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:10,699
wince as much around them

787
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,534
with everybody, but, you know,

788
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,162
there's some pain there.

789
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,329
>> You want your ankle taped?

790
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,833
You want it wrapped?

791
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,793
>> It's killing me, but the

792
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,546
fact that I'm not limping, yes,

793
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:24,880
it's on purpose.

794
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,007
I want them to think I can walk.

795
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,632
I just think I'm a major target

796
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,343
right now.

797
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,553
There's no doubt in my mind.

798
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,971
If I don't do well in the next

799
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,808
challenge, I'm gone.

800
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:48,403
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

801
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:48,737
All right.

802
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,738
First things first.

803
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:54,868
Cindy, give up immunity.

804
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,455
So Nakum has decorated the

805
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,456
immunity idol.

806
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,540
Brian, got to be a little

807
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,750
irritating.

808
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,043
>> It's going to be a blue

809
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:03,877
feather tonight.

810
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,753
No problem.

811
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,212
>> PROBST: All right.

812
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:05,795
Let's get to today's immunity

813
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,131
challenge.

814
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,382
Here's how it works.

815
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,884
On my go, both tribes will

816
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,094
paddle out and retrieve three

817
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:13,637
tribe-colored bags.

818
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,638
You will then race back to

819
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,639
shore.

820
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,640
Once you're back on your mat,

821
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,808
untie the bags and empty them

822
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,477
into a basket.

823
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,020
Inside each bag, you'll find

824
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,396
Maya war clubs.

825
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,689
You'll then throw the clubs at

826
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,192
three targets which are 30, 40

827
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,985
and 50 feet away.

828
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,862
First tribe to break all three

829
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,530
tiles wins immunity.

830
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,032
Losers, Tribal Council.

831
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,116
Two rules.

832
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,910
No individual tribe member can

833
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,162
break more than one tile.

834
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:39,704
Second rule: if you're not

835
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,123
having any luck, tag out, let

836
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,291
somebody else take a shot.

837
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,376
Nakum, you have one extra

838
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:44,793
member.

839
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,669
You're sitting somebody out.

840
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,670
Who's it going to be?

841
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,254
>> Lydia.

842
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,338
>> PROBST: Lydia, take a spot on

843
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:48,672
the bench.

844
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,006
Everybody else, take a spot on

845
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,757
the start.

846
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,010
Wait for my go.

847
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:54,803
Here we go, guys.

848
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,639
For immunity, Survivors ready?

849
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:02,352
Go.

850
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,730
>> Push in a little bit.

851
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,400
>> Everybody together.

852
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:08,942
On the count of three, go.

853
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,360
Paddle.

854
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,152
All together.

855
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,028
>> PROBST: Both tribes paddling

856
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,781
very well.

857
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,199
>> Grab it.

858
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,117
>> PROBST: Yaxha at their first

859
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,993

Amy working on it.

861
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:19,786
Nakum at their first bag.

862
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,580
Rafe trying to untie it.

863
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,415
>> Bite it hard.

864
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:23,790
>> Pull, pull.

865
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,583
>> Okay, got it.

866
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,501
>> PROBST: Nakum has their first

867
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:27,294

868

870
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,297

They're back in it.

872
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,091
It's a race to the second bag.

873
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:38,305
>> Ramming speed!

874
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,349
>> Paddle, paddle, paddle.

875
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:41,766
>> Paddle harder.

876
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,809
>> We can't.

877
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,810
>> Rafe, push them out of the

878
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:44,644
way.

879
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,645
>> Paddle, guys, we're so close

880
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,939
to ours.

881
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:48,732
>> PROBST: Nakum is pushing

882
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,942
Yaxha off the course.

883

Yaxha in trouble.

00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,951
Big advantage for Nakum.

887
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,827
>> Come on, guys.

888
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,661

00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,848
>> PROBST: Brian switching out

951
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,599
with Danni.

952
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,809
Judd still trying to connect

953
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,852
with the second target for

954
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:49,769
Nakum.

955
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,895
>> Oh!

956
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:55,024
>> PROBST: Just misses.

957
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,901
>> Keep throwing it, momma.

958
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,571
>> PROBST: Danni very close.

959
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,574
Danni connects.

960
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,159
We're tied 1-1.

961
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,493
Blake now in.

962
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,995
Judd still throwing for Nakum.

963
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,788
>> Judd, do you want to switch

964
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:08,955
out?

965
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,540
Let's switch out.

966
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,374
>> Let me get this middle

967
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,210
one.

968
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,336
>> Yes!

969
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,296
>> PROBST: Second tile for

970
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,297
Yaxha.

971
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,756
Yaxha now in the lead.

972
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,842
Judd still throwing.

973
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,969
Brandon going for the last

974
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:23,928
target.

975
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,472
Judd needs to catch up.

976
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,806
Got to break something.

977
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,641
>> Judd, throw like a tomahawk.

978
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,436
Come on.

979
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,395
>> PROBST: And Judd connects.

980
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:32,979
We're tied 2-2.

981
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,814
Jamie in.

982
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,274
One tile left.

983
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:36,900
It's Brandon and Jamie going for

984
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:41,571
the last deep tile.

985
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,614
Brandon clips it.

986
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,449
No, it's not broken.

987
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,284
>> Come on.

988
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,327
>> PROBST: Next broken tile wins

989
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,495
immunity.

990
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,748
Losers go to Tribal Council.

991
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,082
Brandon just misses again for

992
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,334
Yaxha.

993
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:54,834
>> Oh.

994
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,545
Oh.

995
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,338
>> Come on, Brian.

996
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,631
Keep on popping it, Brandon.

997
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,965
>> PROBST: Brandon connects for

998
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,675
Yaxha.

999
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,219
Yaxha wins immunity.

1000
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:08,890
(cheering)

1001
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,479
Yaxha, immunity is yours.

1002
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,522
I have a feeling the yellow

1003
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,315
feathers will be coming out just

1004
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,316
like that.

1005
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,317
>> Immediately.

1006
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,318
>> PROBST: Saved from Tribal

1007
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,319
Council tonight.

1008
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,320
Guaranteed at least one more day

1009
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,696
out here.

1010
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,949
Nakum, Tribal Council tonight.

1011
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,200
New mixture of members on your

1012
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,284
tribe should make for an

1013
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,410
interesting afternoon.

1014
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,286
I'll see you at Tribal.

1015
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,162
Get in your boats.

1016
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,998
Head on out.

1017
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,849
>> I just don't like losing.

1018
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,767
They think they're a better

1019
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,268
team now and they're not.

1020
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,686
>> I know.

1021
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,311
>> The bottom line is it's still

1022
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,688
going to be 7-7.

1023
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,397
We're still even.

1024
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:57,855
>> Yeah.

1025
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,398
>> No matter what happens.

1026
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,358
>> Someone has to go home now.

1027
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,443
>> I know. It sucks.

1028
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,278
>> Tonight at Tribal Council,

1029
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:03,987
it's this four Nakum, four

1030
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,948
Yaxha, going head-to-head, and

1031
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,700
all we needed to do, our plan

1032
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,076
since we got here was to try

1033
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,869
to flip one of them, so we

1034
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,287
could get a leg up.

1035
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,038
Hopefully, it will be Judd.

1036
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,834
We need Judd to feel comfortable

1037
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,835
with us.

1038
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,420
>> Right. He does, he does.

1039
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,797
>> He can't stand Margaret or...

1040
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,048
it seems like.

1041
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,009
>> I have what I hope, but

1042
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,844
I would not be surprised for one

1043
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,680
second if it was a 4-4 tie.

1044
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,223
>> So what we're thinking is, I

1045
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,393
think it would be wise to keep

1046
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,603
the majority.

1047
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,228
At the same time I feel bad for

1048
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,022
Lydia puts her heart and soul

1049
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:39,272
into it.

1050
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,815
>> But that's all of us,

1051
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:41,524
all of us are going home.

1052
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,233
>> You can't win the game

1053
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,192
worried about people's feeling.

1054
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,027
>> All of us are going to go

1055
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,029
home broken.

1056
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,405
>> We just had an immunity

1057
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,448
challenge that was a really

1058
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,491
close call and unfortunately we

1059
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,576
lost it.

1060
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,077
And everyone at camp seems to be

1061
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,454
under the impression we just got

1062
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,456
to vote the weakest person off.

1063
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,040
>> What are you telling Judd?

1064
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,877
>> That we want Lydia?

1065
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,086
>> That we're voting for Lydia.

1066
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,171
That's what we're doing.

1067
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,089
>> First, Brooke and Cindy and I

1068
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,800
are going to stick together.

1069
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,678
We have to decide where Judd

1070
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,847
stands-- how much, you know,

1071
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,098
loyalty he has to the old Nakum

1072
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:19,771
tribe.

1073
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,022
>> So what's the word down by

1074
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,315
the dock?

1075
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,483
What are they talking about?

1076
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,567
>> I'm kind of thinking that we

1077
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,860
have to vote off whoever is the

1078
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,362
weakest.

1079
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,571
You know? I mean it really

1080
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,822
sucks.

1081
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,157
>> So, give me a name.

1082
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,991
Who are they saying?

1083
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,493
>> We're thinking Lydia.

1084
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,619
Does that seem to be what

1085
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,954
everybody else is?

1086
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,623
>> Sounds fine with me.

1087
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,957
Whatever you all want to do.

1088
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,958
>> You know, I mean, I don't

1089
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:45,254
want to, but...

1090
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,054
>> I'd like old Nakum to stick

1091
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,223
together.

1092
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,265
I really would.

1093
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,475
>> Okay.

1094
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,686
>> But we've got 4-4, right?

1095
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,603
>> Uh-huh.

1096
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,229
>> If they vote one of us, we

1097
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,981
vote one of them.

1098
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,858
>> I mean, at this point, you

1099
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,653
basically want to go for the

1100
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,278
weakest player, I mean, and it's

1101
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,532
I mean, Lydia and Brooke are

1102
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,741
like this.

1103
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,784
I mean, they're both even.

1104
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,203
So, you know, and then what

1105
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,455
happens is then it goes back and

1106
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,039
forth.

1107
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,083
I lose one, we lose one, they

1108
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,584
lose one, we lose one, they lose

1109
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,127
one.

1110
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,838
>> It won't be that.

1111
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,214
It's not going to do that.

1112
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,132
Because they're gonna be four.

1113
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,049
We'll be three.

1114
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,300
They can pick us off one by one

1115
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,927
because they'll always have

1116
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,928
majority.

1117
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,680
Whoever comes out with a

1118
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,640
majority tribe tonight will have

1119
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,683
majority all along.

1120
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,685
>> Yeah, but listen, they don't

1121
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,227
want to lose either, man.

1122
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,062
They're gonna need us.

1123
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:43,438
They need us bad.

1124
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,981
They need me and you.

1125
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,440
>> Absolutely. But...

1126
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,816
>> They're not going to want to

1127
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,483
get rid of me and you.

1128
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,152
>> But they can also-- they can

1129
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,904
also say, first, we'll start

1130
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,031
with Brooke.

1131
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:54,824
Then we'll go Cindy.

1132
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,408
Then we'll go Margaret.

1133
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,701
Then we'll go Judd.

1134
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,994
That gets them into the merger,

1135
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,912
because they can pick us off one

1136
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:00,455
by one and they can use your

1137
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,914
strength.

1138
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,915
Because you're still not voted

1139
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:03,916
off, but you're always in the

1140
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,167
minority.

1141
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,127
>> Well, if that's the case, of

1142
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,003
course.

1143
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,171
I mean, it's four against one.

1144
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,758
>> You're up in the air?

1145
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,176
>> Just, right now, I'm just

1146
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,552
like whoa, you know, but you

1147
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,304
definitely got my wheels

1148
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:16,512
turning.

1149
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:20,850
There's no doubt about that.

1150
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,233
>> My biggest concern right now,

1151
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,777
of course, is Jamie and

1152
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,111
Stephenie not being as loyal

1153
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,613
as they say they are.

1154
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,823
That leaves me vulnerable.

1155
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,574
Now they've got four against my

1156
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:18,866
one here.

1157
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,910
You know, and that's a little

1158
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:21,118
scary.

1159
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,246
>> It's freakin' hot, man.

1160
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,837
>> In this game, you can't

1161
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,880
trust anybody.

1162
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,549
You can't trust anybody.

1163
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,675
Sometimes you can't sleep at

1164
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,926
night thinking about it.

1165
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,010
You know, is it going to come

1166
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:38,553
back and hit me in the face?

1167
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,805
So when I go to Tribal Council,

1168
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,806
I don't know who I'm going to

1169
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,598
choose.

1170
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,016
I mean, I don't know until I get

1171
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,101
there.

1172
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,602
I mean, that's just the way it

1173
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,228
is.

1174
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,815
I mean, I really-- I don't know.

1175
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:14,839
>> PROBST: Welcome back to

1176
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,132
Tribal Council.

1177
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,342
Steph, this season in challenges

1178
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,094
you've participated in, you're

1179
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,637
now one for seven.

1180
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,889
That brings your<i> Survivor</i>

1181
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,433
total to four out of 21.

1182
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,393
Maybe it's not bad luck

1183
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,021
following Steph, but maybe Steph

1184
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,355
is the bad luck.

1185
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:31,606
>> I know.

1186
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,190
I thought that today, too.

1187
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:33,649
I was, like, is it me?

1188
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,610
Do I just have this black cloud

1189
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,111
that follows me around in the

1190
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:38,946
game of<i> Survivor,</i> wherever I go?

1191
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,530
You know, I like to think I'm

1192
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,283
not bad luck, because that would

1193
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:42,450
suck.

1194
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,660
But for some reason, I end up on

1195
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,537
the short side of the stick.

1196
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,455
>> PROBST: Margaret, tell me

1197
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,373
about the new tribe dynamics.

1198
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,292
You guys were divided evenly.

1199
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,544
Did you sense pairing off or

1200
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,462
"we better stick together"?

1201
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,798
>> There wasn't much pairing off

1202
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,926
except on one occasion.

1203
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,011
Judd was with Stephenie and

1204
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,179
Jamie.

1205
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,097
And they were... connected

1206
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,307
pretty quickly.

1207
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,933
>> PROBST: And did you read that

1208
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,267
as something's going on or...

1209
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,144
>> I hoped he was just

1210
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:10,978
socializing.

1211
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,021
And I'm still hoping that he's

1212
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,439
just socializing.

1213
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,440
>> PROBST: Judd, did you know

1214
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,316
people were watching you, and

1215
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,859
were you trying to hide it?

1216
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,777
>> I wasn't hiding nothing.

1217
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,402
We were just out there taking it

1218
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,821
all in, just hanging out, having

1219
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,989
a good time, laughing, getting

1220
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:22,406
to know each other.

1221
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,200
I mean just met them.

1222
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,284
They just came into the tribe.

1223
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,577
I was just kind of shooting the

1224
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:26,994
breeze with them.

1225
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,829
I mean, "Hey, what's up, man?

1226
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,455
I'm Judd.

1227
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,790
How you doing?"

1228
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,457
>> PROBST: Lydia, you've been to

1229
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,292
Tribal Council quite a few

1230
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,251
times.

1231
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,252
>> Three times. Too much.

1232
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,253
>> PROBST: You feel a little

1233
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:36,837
more confident now, with this

1234
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,173
new tribe or just as vulnerable?

1235
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:39,715
>> Well, Jeff, I have to say

1236
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,634
that, you know, I do feel

1237
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:42,593
a little bit vulnerable.

1238
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,552
It's a new tribe.

1239
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,428
They don't know me.

1240
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,680
They don't know my strength yet,

1241
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,472
you know.

1242
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,974
I just have to put faith in them

1243
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:48,975
and see what they think about

1244
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:49,809
me.

1245
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,352
But all in all, you know, I'm

1246
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:51,852
not ready to leave, so...

1247
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,437
>> PROBST: Brooke, what

1248
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,856
specifically worries you

1249
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,983
tonight?

1250
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:57,942
>> I feel like if you have the

1251
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,360
brute strength, you're safe on

1252
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,404
your team, because it's about

1253
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,531
winning the immunity challenges

1254
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,825
right now, and so I feel, in

1255
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,450
some ways, that the women are a

1256
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,744
little bit more vulnerable than

1257
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,288
the men at this point.

1258
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,497
>> PROBST: Judd, in your

1259
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,832
profession, you deal with all

1260
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,792
different kinds of people every

1261
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,960
day.

1262
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,003
How important is that in this

1263
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:17,628
game, to be able to read people,

1264
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,379
make a decision, and be right?

1265
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,339
>> Oh, it's very important.

1266
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,092
I mean, I know who I connect

1267
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,051
with right away.

1268
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:24,552
That's just the way I am.

1269
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,512
Somebody's looking at me, I can

1270
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,972
tell right away, wow, man, I got

1271
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,556
a connection to you, and we

1272
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,683
definitely have something in

1273
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,392
common.

1274
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:31,976
I mean, you know, it's easy.

1275
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:32,560
I can really pick people off

1276
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,271
like that.

1277
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:35,980
>> PROBST: Okay.

1278
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:36,856
It is time to vote.

1279
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,276
Brooke, you're up.

1280
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,534
>> Lydia, I think you're one of

1281
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,453
the hardest workers around camp,

1282
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,912
but I'm just making this vote

1283
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,122
based on the decision that we

1284
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:57,960
need to win immunity challenges.

1285
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:05,926
>> Brooke, you're an awesome

1286
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,261
person, but this vote is for

1287
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:08,763
strategy tonight.

1288
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,430
If you go, I have a chance to go

1289
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,431
a lot further.

1290
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,517
I'm sorry.

1291
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,900
>> Lydia, I have tribe

1292
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,193
loyalties.

1293
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,569
I gave Brooke my word, and I

1294
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,779
won't go back.

1295
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,407
Good luck.

1296
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,723
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1297
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,601
votes.

1298
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,403
Once the votes are read, the

1299
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,279
decision is final.

1300
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,364
Person voted out will be asked

1301
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:08,989
to leave the Tribal Council area

1302
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,491
immediately.

1303
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,660
I'll read the votes.

1304
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:18,874
First vote, Lydia.

1305
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,459
Brooke.

1306
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,671
One vote Brooke, one vote Lydia.

1307
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,464
Lydia.

1308
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,590
Two votes Lydia, one vote

1309
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,553
Brooke.

1310
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,347
Lydia.

1311
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,143
That's three votes Lydia.

1312
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,477
Brooke.

1313
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,521
Two votes Brooke, three votes

1314
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,440
Lydia.

1315
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,192
Brooke.

1316
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:45,943
We're tied.

1317
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,403
Three votes Brooke, three votes

1318
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:51,031
Lydia.

1319
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,658
That's four votes Brooke, three

Survivor: Guatemala, Brooke.

1323
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,668
You need to bring me your torch.

1324
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:16,056
Brooke, the tribe has spoken.

1325
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,767
It's time for you to go.

1326
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,774
Tribal lines and personal

1327
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:26,650
loyalties are going to shift

1328
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,278
throughout this game.

1329
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,363
Just remember, every time you

1330
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,157
shift, you make it harder to

1331
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,491
trust.

1332
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,284
Grab your torches.

1333
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,076
Go back to camp.

1334
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,245
Good night.

We're all here to win a million

>> I'm not a religious person.

1355
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:05,731
But it would be stupid to say,

1356
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,690
you know what, guys, I don't

1357
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,776
want to thank Jesus for this

1359
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,778
>> Lydia gets wacky.

1360
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,821
>> I'm the queen. Whoo! Shut up.

>> Even though I've only gotten

1362
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,579
to be out here for 11 days, I

1363
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,873
did so much stuff that I never

1364
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,749
thought I'd be able to do.

1365
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,834
I think I proved myself going

1366
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:26,794
through the 11-mile jungle trek.

1367
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,088
But I don't think my new team

1368
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,089
members got to see that.

1369
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,090
So I didn't get a longer chance

1370
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,091
out here to prove how strong I

1371
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,384
am. I want to wish the girls

1372
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,009
from my original team good luck.
