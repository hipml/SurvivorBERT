1
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:04,572
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,841
Approaching the board,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,044
Desiree was ready 
to betray her alliance.

4
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:13,581
I'm ready 
to take out Kellyn, Wendell and Dom.

5
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:16,325
But Laurel 
warned Domenick of the mutiny.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,429
Des tries to rally 
the four Malolos against you.

7
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:21,954
Oh my God! 
It's going to go downhill here.

8
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,515
At the council,

9
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,073
Domenick, Wendell et Kellyn

10
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:28,672
struck first.

11
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:30,229
Desiree, the tribe has spoken.

12
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:37,072
There are ten left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

13
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:57,764
The council was one hell of a show.

14
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:02,601
It was quite a challenge to determine 
who was telling the truth and who was lying.

15
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:05,443
Laurel told me 
that the Naviti girls

16
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:08,683
wanted to eliminate 
Kellyn, Wendell and me.

17
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:10,813
Luckily she was there!

18
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:14,850
That damn smoke!

19
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,539
I want...

20
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:21,293
...just kiss you and thank 
you for saving my ass.

21
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,884
Thanks for believing me.

22
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:25,908
Listen...

23
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,752
If you hadn't done 
what you did,

24
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:31,031
she would have jumped, 
then Wendell and me.

25
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:33,496
And I would be alone. 
I wouldn't be here anymore.

26
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,692
I appreciate. 
I am with you.

27
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:40,401
For the first time, I'm really 
happy with my place in the game.

28
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:43,037
I think I've secured protection

29
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:47,182
of Kellyn, Domenick and Wendell 
because I saved them tonight.

30
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,492
My apologies for doubting you.

31
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,097
You had your reasons.

32
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:55,329
Yeah. No, it seems to me 
that even for this vote,

33
00:01:55,454 --> 00:02:00,287
it solidified your position, 
seeing how it went,

34
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,556
with a good group.

35
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:05,269
Even though Laurel saved me,

36
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:08,665
I'm still not sure I 
want to work with her

37
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,010
for the sequel.

38
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:12,502
The good news is that Naviti

39
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:15,544
always has the majority.

40
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,197
And that's how I'll go to the end.

41
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:19,847
With the Naviti welded.

42
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,215
What a day!

43
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,075
If we find another ripe papaya,

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,378
we should make fruit rice.

45
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,551
Eleven days.

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,299
Much remains to be done.

47
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,299
The finish line is in sight,

48
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:43,867
Yeah, that's crazy.

49
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,358
We must not betray ourselves. 
I promise.

50
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,709
I promise. 
Alright, my brother.

51
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,399
It will work for me 
only if we think together.

52
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,505
But we can. We can.

53
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,581
My alliance with Domenick 
is obvious to everyone.

54
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:05,581
It's obvious. It is known, we have already 
been targeted, nothing new.

55
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:09,105
But I don't think people 
realize that Laurel and Donathan

56
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,858
are also with us.

57
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:12,658
So we are discreet.

58
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:15,435
This is our best strategy 
to go to the end.

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,764
Dom. If we take it out on each other,

60
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,709
we will both die. 
Yes.

61
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:24,691
You understand? 
I agree 1000%.

62
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,995
We agree. 
It is unthinkable.

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,561
My relationship with Wendell is crazy.

64
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,135
We are very good friends,

65
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,472
but i am here to earn money 
for my family.

66
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:39,853
So if it means 
breaking that bond with Wendell,

67
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,856
it's a risk I'm 
willing to take when the time comes.

68
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:45,259
I'm going to lie down for a moment. 
Yes.

69
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:47,844
I already have an idol.

70
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,839
But Michael played one 
a few days ago.

71
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,384
So if there's a new one here, 
I plan to find it.

72
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,053
I can't give up.

73
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:59,073
I have to do this, 
for my wife and my children.

74
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,103
I have lived on this camp 
since day one.

75
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:06,783
So I know 
the places on the beach

76
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:10,599
where I can look 
for trees that look suspicious.

77
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:15,141
Or rocks 
that seem to be placed abnormally.

78
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:19,059
This is my advantage 
over some other players.

79
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:22,963
And, passing again next to this grove, 
I lower my eyes...

80
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:27,100
I see this coconut with an emblem.

81
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,410
And I knew I had hit the nail on the head.

82
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:33,427
Its weight suggests that 
it contains something solid.

83
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:36,322
I can't wait 
to open it.

84
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,137
Oh my God!

85
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:44,318
I need to get rid of this quickly!

86
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:51,103
"Congratulations! This might 
empower you,

87
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:53,720
but maybe not 
the one you expect.

88
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:57,740
This is the real fake idol 
David cheated on Jay with

89
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,927
in Season 33, 
Gen Y vs. Gen X."

90
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:04,136
Wow! In fact, this grove

91
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,285
reminded me of season 33.

92
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:09,574
"Having reached the final sextet,

93
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:12,685
Jay did what you just did."

94
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,594
Those idiots didn't see her!

95
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:17,588
"He picked up a coco 
and found David's false idol."

96
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:19,987
Thanks! 
And here's another!

97
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:21,846
"Believing her true..."

98
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,758
You have to be faster! 
"...Jay let his guard down.

99
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,326
A fatal mistake."

100
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,250
This is a work of art.

101
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,198
But... not an immunity idol.

102
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,185
"And Jay was eliminated that night."

103
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,099
Oh my God!

104
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:43,859
"But this tainted idol 
did not become a real one.

105
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:47,520
Since she has no power, 
the curse cannot be reversed.

106
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:49,829
Your chance to gain power

107
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,721
depends on your ability 
to trick another player.

108
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,722
Are you smart enough 
to do this?"

109
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,128
Let's plan this.

110
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:59,244
David cheated on Jay with this,

111
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:01,694
and Jay walked out. Very much.

112
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:04,138
I hope I can do the same.

113
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,632
Am I just gonna hide it somewhere

114
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:11,462
or find 
out how to target a specific person?

115
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:14,208
No one can do that 
better than me.

116
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:28,938
Over here, everyone!

117
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,328
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

118
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,574
First, Chelsea, 
I'm taking the necklace back.

119
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:49,209
Thanks. 
Okay!

120
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:54,748
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

121
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,455
Today 
you will support a bar,

122
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,523
jamming a bullet 
between two jaws.

123
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:04,398
If you release the pressure,

124
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:05,915
the ball will fall

125
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:08,678
and it's lost.

126
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:11,765
And today 
there is a twist.

127
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,018
Because it's not a...

128
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,449
...but two people...

129
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:18,505
My God!

130
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,172
...who will win immunity.

131
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:21,857
and two people

132
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:24,278
will be eliminated tonight.

133
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,343
Because there will be two separate councils.

134
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:34,054
Oh my God! 
My God!

135
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:36,690
Here's how it will work.

136
00:07:36,854 --> 00:07:39,973
We are going to draw lots for 
two provisional tribes.

137
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,443
Five Oranges, five Violets.

138
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:45,540
The last Orange that stands 
wins immunity,

139
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,916
is safe at the council of Oranges.

140
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:51,071
The Last Violet That Holds

141
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:54,274
wins immunity, 
is safe in the council of the Violets.

142
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,968
So two people will leave.

143
00:07:57,348 --> 00:08:00,274
And, further incentive 
to hold on,

144
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,634
the last of you ten to hold

145
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,845
earns the right for his tribe

146
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,081
to go to the council last.

147
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:11,158
This tribe will therefore know 
who left first.

148
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,351
Oh my God!

149
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:16,177
Good. Hit or miss. 
No Ghost Island today.

150
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:19,166
There are enough issues. 
We will draw the tribes by lot.

151
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:20,414
On and go.

152
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:28,308
Well, the two tribes are formed.

153
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:31,211
In one, in orange:

154
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:36,578
not Kelly's.

155
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:38,530
All clash,

156
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,554
one of the five will leave tonight.

157
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:42,015
In the other group:

158
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:47,204
Jenna and Donathan.

159
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:50,233
You too 
only clash with each other.

160
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:53,198
One will win immunity, 
one will leave.

161
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,626
Grasp your handles.

162
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:57,804
Lift.

163
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:02,571
Everyone is in place,

164
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:04,845
the test is launched.

165
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:10,886
New test 
and new twist

166
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,173
for Survivor and its 36th season.

167
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:16,152
Everything rests on your arms.

168
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:19,988
If you release the pressure, 
the handle will go down,

169
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:23,096
your ball will fall 
and you will be on the bench.

170
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,894
Only five people per tribe.

171
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,201
Immunity is key tonight.

172
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,479
Kellyn's first foul.

173
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:37,225
The slightest relaxation 
in the pressure,

174
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,933
that's all it takes.

175
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,243
Kellyn releases again.

176
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:43,950
First eliminated.

177
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:46,980
No immunity for Kellyn tonight.

178
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:49,050
It is a misleading test.

179
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:50,957
As long as you push,

180
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:53,653
you'll hold 
those jaws shut.

181
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:00,067
Michael loses his ball, 
he is eliminated.

182
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:02,419
No immunity for Michael.

183
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:05,939
Michael goes to the bench. 
It can happen as quickly as that.

184
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:10,020
There are three Oranges left.

185
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:13,312
The five Violets are still there 
and seem solid.

186
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:16,662
The pressure is going to intensify.

187
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:20,834
Because if you let go a bit 
and the ball starts to go down,

188
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,091
it becomes all the more difficult 
to maintain it.

189
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:31,899
And suddenly, Donathan, 
a little movement and it's over.

190
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:33,767
More than four Violets

191
00:10:33,936 --> 00:10:35,490
and three Oranges.

192
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:38,340
Laurel loses pressure, 
ball gets closer

193
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:40,685
gradually from the end.

194
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,120
Laurel loses her ball, 
she is eliminated.

195
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:49,149
More than two Oranges.

196
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:55,243
side by side, vying for immunity.

197
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:56,938
You won't beat me. 
Whether.

198
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:58,096
I'm going to win.

199
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,495
It discusses!

200
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:02,164
A little further, in purple:

201
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,060
and Jenna

202
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:08,760
are vying for immunity.

203
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,362
I am in pain. 
Hold on!

204
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,209
Shit! 
Sebastian's first foul.

205
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:20,343
Jenna's first foul.

206
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:22,008
And another.

207
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,585
Sebastian and Jenna, a danger.

208
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,507
Sebastian is eliminated.

209
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:29,655
Jenna tries to adjust.

210
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,725
No, it falls, it is eliminated.

211
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,927
More than two in each tribe.

212
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:38,445
Immunity for Domenick or Wendell,

213
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:41,533
and for Chelsea or Angela.

214
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:44,938
She could 
be worth a million dollars.

215
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:46,804
Damn, yeah!

216
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:53,478
You've been here 15 minutes.

217
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:56,108
Wendell's arms are shaking.

218
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:58,501
Domenick's forearms move.

219
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,889
did not move

220
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:03,891
at all.

221
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,932
Chelsea, all of a sudden, 
his ball starts to move.

222
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:15,372
Chelsea struggles to hold on.

223
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:17,704
She stayed strong for 
a long time.

224
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,345
Her whole body is moving now.

225
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,976
But she's holding on.

226
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,035
Suddenly, Angela loses her ball!

227
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,217
Chelsea 
win individual immunity!

228
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,486
And There you go.

229
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:36,311
Cheer! 
Finished for Chelsea.

230
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,415
In other words, the Violets 
will go to the board first.

231
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,356
No big deal, Chelsea. 
But she is safe.

232
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:44,913
And now 
we have a face-to-face.

233
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:49,569
Not only 
will you gain immunity,

234
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,789
but you will go to the council 
second,

235
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:53,962
with the advantage of information.

236
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,257
I want this necklace!

237
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,562
You'll have 
to last another hour then.

238
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:59,443
No problem. 
We stay.

239
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:00,940
It's nothing. He is stubborn.

240
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:02,486
I am stubborn?!

241
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,185
My schedule is free. 
Mine too, Jeff.

242
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,588
You've been there 
for more than 30 minutes.

243
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:16,896
Wendell moves a lot, 
but his ball doesn't.

244
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,273
Let it go, stop this nonsense!

245
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,642
I will not move.

246
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,469
Domenick tries to impose himself

247
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,056
by a verbal attack.

248
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:25,734
I have eight siblings.

249
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:28,495
We would kill each other 
for the last nugget on the table.

250
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,743
You see?

251
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,551
Oh oh! It begins!

252
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:35,755
I am relaxed.

253
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,043
First start of movement. 
Do not let go!

254
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,889
First movement at Domenick.

255
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,961
Wendell turned his head.

256
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:47,547
Hey! I've been watching the show 
since day one.

257
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,684
I'll put that necklace on tonight. 
He is for me.

258
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,396
My family 
is watching me from that bench over there.

259
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:54,828
I will not lose.

260
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:57,407
Green brings me luck. 
So much the better.

261
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:01,436
Domenick against Wendell, 
to win the bet.

262
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:04,272
It is pure will.

263
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,950
Things are still moving at Wendell.

264
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:12,218
The body trembles, 
the forearms burn.

265
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:15,881
Good luck, Dom!

266
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,400
Wendell laughs!

267
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,604
Domenick 
wins individual immunity!

268
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:22,387
Safe at the council tonight, 
and he earns the right

269
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:25,484
for the Oranges 
to go to the board second

270
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:28,666
and see 
what the Violets will have done before.

271
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,473
Chelsea, come here!

272
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,289
Bravo, Chelsea!

273
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:38,179
For the second time in a row,

274
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:41,162
immunity is yours. 
You are safe tonight.

275
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:42,748
Domenick, come here!

276
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,443
Bravo, Chelsea!

277
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:48,677
Domenick, 
safe at council tonight.

278
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:52,385
Neither Chelsea nor Domenick 
can be eliminated.

279
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,294
Alas, Jenna, Sebastian,

280
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:55,919
Angela, Donathan,

281
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:57,664
you will go to the council first,

282
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:00,372
where one of you four will be eliminated.

283
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:03,737
Ensuite, Kellyn, 
Michael, Laurel, Wendell,

284
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,492
one of you will be eliminated.

285
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:08,575
Two people eliminated tonight, 
two dreams that will end.

286
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,720
Thank you for Chelsea, Domenick.

287
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:13,012
Take your things, leave. 
See you tonight.

288
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:14,849
Cheer. Cheer. 
Thanks.

289
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:19,249
I had to win. 
I don't know what happened.

290
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:22,337
Now 
I'm up against three original Navitis.

291
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:24,582
I have to find something,

292
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,899
because I don't want to leave tonight.

293
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,536
Like a feeling of deja vu!

294
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:48,336
Cheer! 
Thanks.

295
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,135
You are a warrior!

296
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:52,735
You are too kind.

297
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:56,235
Chelsea, Dom, great job! 
Thanks.

298
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:58,336
It was hard 
thanks.

299
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:02,135
For the council tonight 
we have two groups of five.

300
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:04,374
The first is Chelsea,

301
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:07,411
Donathan, Jenna, Sebastian and Angela.

302
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:10,311
I had not anticipated 
this twist.

303
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,010
It was creepy. 
Without a draw at the start...

304
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:14,610
Survivor slapped us!

305
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:17,185
And in my group, apart from me,

306
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,110
Michael and Kelly.

307
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:23,102
Cheer. 
A tiny mistake!

308
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:24,510
Finally I know that!

309
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:28,211
For tonight, 
the plan is to vote out Michael.

310
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:31,836
It should be easy. 
You can turn it off without a problem.

311
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:43,235
What is being said? 
What's going on for you?

312
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:47,749
I would like not to 
play my idol tonight.

313
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,836
I haven't decided 
on that yet.

314
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,311
Coming back to the camp, 
I know that I will probably be targeted.

315
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:57,092
I wanted to speak to Donathan 
as soon as possible,

316
00:16:57,342 --> 00:16:59,628
because he has an idol.

317
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:03,211
And to me, 
that's one of my last options.

318
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,759
Can I ask you a favor? 
What?

319
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:08,236
Since we're going to separate councils,

320
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:12,911
could I borrow 
it for a few hours to show it?

321
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,611
That they believe her mine? 
No.

322
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:15,711
Do not? 
Do not.

323
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:16,728
Why?

324
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:19,425
It could be traced back to me 
and screw up my plans.

325
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,840
But that won't happen. 
No one suspects...

326
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,967
My bag is already made, 
she's in it.

327
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:28,810
Even though we're allies, I can't 
give my idol to Michael.

328
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:32,211
I'm here to win 
a million dollars.

329
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:34,911
I have to 
consider my interest first.

330
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:38,934
I don't want my idol 
to be known before the council.

331
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:40,836
I do my Calimero.

332
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:43,611
I can participate? 
Yes!

333
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:46,942
Donathan 
gave me a clear answer.

334
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:50,252
I would have preferred another.

335
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:54,810
So even though lying is risky, 
if I say I have an idol,

336
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:57,719
I might be able 
to work this in my favor

337
00:17:57,969 --> 00:17:59,810
and save me again.

338
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:02,911
To succeed would be pretty cool.

339
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:06,510
I have to trust you 100%. 
Can I?

340
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,211
I know you won't say anything.

341
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:11,810
I have an idol and I will play it. 
I'm not leaving tonight.

342
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:14,211
The cow! He has an idol!

343
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:16,211
Good blood wood!

344
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:20,508
Things seem 
more dangerous than ever.

345
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:23,711
If it works, tonight 
I'm with you...

346
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,642
And I... 
I'm with you for good.

347
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,663
If it works. I'm super serious.

348
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,488
I think she thinks 
I have the idol.

349
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:34,322
I convinced her 
that I was going to play it tonight.

350
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:37,842
I did my best, I believe.

351
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,068
At this point, it's a last resort.

352
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:43,010
I hope it pays off 
and I stay.

353
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:45,010
You don't tell Laurel about it, huh?

354
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:46,611
But no! 
Good.

355
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:47,810
No problem.

356
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,211
Michael has already found two idols.

357
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:53,010
That there is another is possible.

358
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:57,810
I'm afraid he'll vote for me 
and I'll leave.

359
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:00,935
He says he has an idol. 
He does not have it.

360
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:04,920
Are you sure? 
He wouldn't tell you.

361
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:09,557
Look at me. 
I know when people are trying to trick me.

362
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:12,611
He does not have it. 
He would have found her the next day...

363
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,697
Let him show it to us! 
I do not want to leave.

364
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:19,536
Kellyn might be freaking out a bit, 
because I doubt he has an idol.

365
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:23,411
So it's risky, 
but I'm voting for Michael.

366
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:26,010
This guy refuses to leave! 
We have to fire him.

367
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:27,411
I do not believe it.

368
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:30,484
I'm not... a genius.

369
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:33,010
But I know how to decipher people.

370
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:35,411
I vote Michael 
because I don't believe him.

371
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:38,810
Domenick 
assures me that I risk nothing.

372
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:41,961
But I fear 
that gifted Michael

373
00:19:42,086 --> 00:19:44,392
really have another idol.

374
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,911
Everything is fine? 
I'm afraid.

375
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:50,165
It could be me tonight.

376
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:53,135
Why? 
Michael, the idol finder.

377
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:55,380
I believe he has one.

378
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:58,211
I do not know. It really looks like.

379
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:01,279
So maybe I'll 
vote for Laurel.

380
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:05,864
Voting Laurel seems safest to me,

381
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:08,211
because I doubt she has an idol.

382
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:12,111
So as long as Wendell follows me, 
we can stay between Naviti.

383
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:14,056
He has an idol.

384
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:17,981
And he will play it tonight, 
no matter what.

385
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:20,362
He acts like he has one.

386
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:24,836
It seems believable. 
And I believe it.

387
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:28,935
If he does have the idol, 
are we ready to sacrifice Laurel?

388
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:33,532
Kellyn, who gets super emotional,

389
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:35,810
wants to place votes on Laurel.

390
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,010
She doesn't know 
that Laurel is my ally.

391
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:41,978
I need to talk to Laurel, 
see what she has in mind.

392
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:44,135
Because we need a plan.

393
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:54,736
Today, it looks like Michael 
has given up or has something.

394
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:57,568
If he releases an idol, 
what happens?

395
00:20:58,236 --> 00:21:01,803
If he votes Kellyn, she leaves. 
And if I don't, it's me.

396
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:05,935
Michael has shown to 
be a fierce competitor.

397
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:08,336
So voting for him makes sense.

398
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:11,211
But if he releases an idol, 
I could leave.

399
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,427
It's frustrating to know that my game

400
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:15,650
depends on whether 
he has an idol or not.

401
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:17,010
What should I do?

402
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:19,845
I don't think clearly, 
I'm stressed.

403
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,123
Because you don't want 
Kellyn out.

404
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,441
For me, she can leave 
anytime.

405
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:27,562
Wendell and Domenick 
are among my closest allies.

406
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,411
They have to protect me 
for this next vote

407
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:32,824
you don't vote Kelly

408
00:21:32,949 --> 00:21:35,804
because she might want to target me.

409
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:39,310
I'll probably vote Kellyn, 
it's the safest for me.

410
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:41,611
Tonight should be easy.

411
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:44,010
I would like Michael to leave.

412
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,143
But if I have to vote Kellyn

413
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:48,711
to save Laurel, I'm ready for it.

414
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:51,536
I feel calm. 
I don't even care.

415
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:54,264
The clock is ticking.

416
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:56,524
I've been thinking about it all day.

417
00:21:56,836 --> 00:22:00,528
I have the secret advantage 
gained on Ghost Island.

418
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,010
I have an extra scroll.

419
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:06,267
I can trace Michaela's name 
and write another one.

420
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:11,310
An extra vote 
is immense power.

421
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:13,922
I'll use my extra vote 
tonight

422
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:16,531
and put two votes on Laurel,

423
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,536
in case Michael 
has an idol.

424
00:22:20,736 --> 00:22:23,111
It should be self-explanatory, right?

425
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:25,411
I don't plan on doing anything crazy.

426
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,736
We should just make 
sure our allies understand.

427
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:31,806
The day was lively.

428
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:34,510
Full of discussions, 
of people isolating themselves,

429
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:37,107
because there will be two councils tonight.

430
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:39,741
We have a few people 
in sight.

431
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:43,111
I hope we can 
get them both out at once.

432
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:48,411
But I'm ready to make 
a big move, take risks,

433
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,423
to protect my allies.

434
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:07,321
I like sunny days. 
Yeah.

435
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:10,417
If we want to do it...

436
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:15,632
I don't know what's going on there, 
but we have the majority.

437
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:16,731
Yeah.

438
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:19,493
With me in my tribe, 
there's Chelsea,

439
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,932
Angela, Donathan and Jenna.

440
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:24,531
Deux Rest, trois Navigation.

441
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:27,434
We've had the majority 
since day one.

442
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:29,656
So all is well.

443
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:33,432
Nope? 
Yeah.

444
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:36,332
We'll have to be super convincing.

445
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,431
On va voter Jenna.

446
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:42,175
And we'll tell him we're voting for Donathan.

447
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:46,731
So many things go through my head.

448
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:49,457
What are my chances 
of leaving tonight?

449
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:52,693
I am in the tribe of Donathan, 
which has the idol.

450
00:23:52,874 --> 00:23:54,217
We are in the minority.

451
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:57,432
As Malolo, 
we know we are in danger.

452
00:23:57,557 --> 00:24:00,757
So I guess 
it will be Donathan or me.

453
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:04,892
Ang is also coming?

454
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:07,057
She will come, I believe.

455
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,432
Would you consider voting Donathan?

456
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:12,656
That's what we do. 
We vote for him.

457
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:15,531
It's the pivotal vote 
that no one wants.

458
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,932
This is where personal connections 
come into play.

459
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:21,557
Chelsea and Sebastian seem ready 
to keep me again.

460
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:23,731
Donathan has to 
believe it's me

461
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:26,057
so that he does not play his idol.

462
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:29,337
Because otherwise, I'm the one leaving, 
and I don't want to.

463
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:32,390
Sebastian said:

464
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:40,957
We had to try. 
I say. Finally...

465
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,557
That's the game.

466
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:46,257
It's frustrating, but...

467
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:48,015
Know that I love you.

468
00:24:48,846 --> 00:24:51,684
Me too. 
Glad we played together.

469
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,731
Sebastian says he will vote Jenna out.

470
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:57,656
I have my idol. 
I can feel calm.

471
00:24:57,781 --> 00:25:01,296
But I don't want Jenna to leave. 
Maybe I can save her.

472
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:04,656
How are you? 
Yes.

473
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:06,531
What's wrong?

474
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:10,401
I'm trying to convince Wendell 
or Domenick to take action against Kellyn.

475
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,332
I'm taking my gear tonight,

476
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:14,731
but should I use 
it for me or for Jenna?

477
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:16,932
I do not know. It's stressful.

478
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:21,293
Laurel is my closest ally. 
But she's in the other group.

479
00:25:21,418 --> 00:25:25,085
Apparently, she could 
leave tonight. It terrifies me.

480
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,731
The Malolos 
had to struggle all along.

481
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:30,190
I wouldn't like to 
see Jenna go either.

482
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:33,727
This game, this game. 
I know.

483
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:38,257
Vote Sebastian, tonight.

484
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:39,457
OK.

485
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:41,504
Why?

486
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:43,480
I will play it on you.

487
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,261
Would you play your idol on me?

488
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:52,656
If you are 100% with me. 
Yes, I will vote Sebastian.

489
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:54,932
I will try to save you.

490
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:56,332
I lied well.

491
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:58,531
Donathan would play his idol on me.

492
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:01,008
He's an idiot. 
I am ready to eliminate it.

493
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:04,457
I'll try to look surprised 
when he joins the jury.

494
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:07,394
Great thanks for being willing to do this.

495
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:10,829
I told Jenna 
I'd play the idol on her,

496
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:13,557
but there are so many variables 
in this game.

497
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,132
It will depend on what 
my gut tells me on the board.

498
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:21,010
It's a huge risk. 
But I think back to Tai and Scott.

499
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:24,231
He did not save the friend 
who could have helped him later.

500
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:27,207
I intend to reverse the curse 
for Malolo.

501
00:26:56,596 --> 00:26:58,480
Now here are the members of the jury.

502
00:27:04,547 --> 00:27:07,474
and Desiree, 
eliminated at the last council.

503
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,634
Donathan. 
Big twist today.

504
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,678
Clearly.

505
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:18,263
You have been divided 
into two temporary tribes.

506
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,737
You will eliminate someone, 
then the other five will come.

507
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:24,437
You shake your head, 
you already know my question.

508
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:27,638
Yes, it definitely put 
the animation on the camp.

509
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:30,647
Jenna and I 
are with three Navitis, so...

510
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,138
It's back to square one.

511
00:27:33,263 --> 00:27:36,638
Sebastian. 
Is it a simple enough vote?

512
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:39,838
The Navitis are going to stay together 
and the Malolos are in trouble?

513
00:27:39,963 --> 00:27:44,062
Yes, the Malolos have been on the wrong side 
of the handle from the start.

514
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:47,638
One can only sympathize 
with their impotence.

515
00:27:47,763 --> 00:27:51,038
So yes, it's pretty clear, 
there are three Naviti and two Malolo.

516
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:54,237
And yet, see the jury. 
That was not the case.

517
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:56,437
There are two Naviti and a Malolo.

518
00:27:56,562 --> 00:28:00,210
Jenna. Did it seem like there was a loophole 
for you to step into?

519
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,437
No flaw. 
The Naviti remain united.

520
00:28:03,562 --> 00:28:07,263
And I'm going to leave, 
that's pretty clear, so...

521
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:09,963
I am ready to vote.

522
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:12,362
Wow! Are you giving up?

523
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:15,163
No, but I've 
been at the bottom all along.

524
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:18,638
Today, the prospect 
of both councils excited me.

525
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,884
But we found 
"the welded Naviti".

526
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:23,300
Everyone has been pretty clear.

527
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:26,075
Sebastian. 
Hearing this, do you say to yourself:

528
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,731
"Wow, aren't you fighting anymore? 
We haven't voted yet!"?

529
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:33,937
Yes, her saying that is very 
interesting. In this game, we fight.

530
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:36,862
It's pretty blunt 
to say that out of hand.

531
00:28:37,263 --> 00:28:40,638
Donathan, hearing Jenna say, 
"It's me and I'm ready.",

532
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:44,038
"Well, at least I'm surviving."?

533
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:47,357
Yes, but people always have 
more than one trick up their sleeves.

534
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:51,437
We never know. They might 
tell me that I'll stay,

535
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:54,362
but Jenna would be surprised 
to see me leave.

536
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:58,335
Chelsea. How would that 
make sense, when there are 3 2?

537
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,213
Because of the fear of idols?

538
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,499
Yes. In case of division 3 2,

539
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:04,947
you can't do anything to 
save yourself

540
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:06,992
if one of these two has an idol.

541
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:09,331
Basically, if you vote wrong,

542
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,935
one of the three Navitis 
you thought was safe, leaves.

543
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,457
So, Donathan, 
what did you do this afternoon?

544
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:18,906
to rock the Naviti 
and cause something?

545
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:21,339
I believe 
these three Naviti are scared

546
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:24,328
to make others look bad, 
so...

547
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:28,032
Hence our desperation, 
Jenna and I, tonight.

548
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:30,499
Jenna. It brings us back to you

549
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:33,221
and your feeling that 
you don't have a chance.

550
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:35,543
Yes. It's clearly 
a Malolo tonight,

551
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:39,490
and from the discussions 
I've had, I believe that's me.

552
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:44,784
So is that really 
all we needed?

553
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,065
Are you really ready to vote?

554
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:53,819
Wow. I don't think I've ever asked 
so few questions of the board.

555
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,991
Well, it's time to vote.

556
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:57,614
Angela, over to you.

557
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:25,726
I will count the votes.

558
00:30:34,943 --> 00:30:37,669
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

559
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,637
now is the time to do it.

560
00:30:55,162 --> 00:30:56,587
Oh my God!

561
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,764
So... That's...

562
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:09,106
Kaôh-Rong's super-idol.

563
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,699
That was Scott's.

564
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:13,888
And this, Tai's.

565
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:16,657
They ultimately didn't 
form the super-idol.

566
00:31:16,782 --> 00:31:18,910
I put them together now,

567
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:20,709
which creates...

568
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:22,212
a normal idol.

569
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:24,834
And I will...

570
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:26,471
say that...

571
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:29,281
Sorry, Jenna, I'm playing it for me.

572
00:31:30,544 --> 00:31:32,450
Good. Thank you, Donathan.

573
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:43,083
Combined, these two pieces 
form an idol.

574
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:45,953
Votes against Donathan 
will not count.

575
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,609
I will read the votes.

576
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:53,791
Donathan. Does not count.

577
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:00,885
Sebastian. A vote Sebastian.

578
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:06,770
Jenna. 
One vote Sebastian, one vote Jenna.

579
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:12,881
Jenna. 
Two votes Jenna, one vote Sebastian,

580
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:14,401
one vote remains.

581
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,805
Eleventh person eliminated 
and fourth member of the jury:

582
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,899
Jenna. Bring me your torch.

583
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:35,253
Jenna, the tribe has spoken.

584
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:43,124
Tonight, you can 
immediately join the jury,

585
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:44,488
next to Desiree.

586
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:53,202
Hi! 
It'll be OK.

587
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,600
Alright, you're done. 
Take your torches, return to camp.

588
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,224
The following are coming.

589
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:18,396
Take place.

590
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,607
And we're going to start.

591
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,373
Let 's start 
with the first big news.

592
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:36,081
You find out, 
Jenna has just been eliminated.

593
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:38,227
Laurel, 
what does this tell you?

594
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:40,200
It sucks to see her there,

595
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:43,229
because it shows that Naviti 
is still playing the same game

596
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,648
only from the start.

597
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,571
We are back in the same position.

598
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:49,483
I feel like I'm repeating 
the same story every day here.

599
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:51,005
And still today.

600
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,113
Yet Domenick, 
by coin toss,

601
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:56,037
once again, on paper, 
Naviti has the majority.

602
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:59,628
It was crazy. 
We draw two teams,

603
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:03,193
and once again Naviti 
was in the majority on both sides.

604
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:05,779
That's the whole story 
of this season.

605
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:07,977
Wendell. Is it that simple?

606
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:11,504
It's Michael and Laurel, 
are we doing it right?

607
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:13,164
Yes, it's the easiest.

608
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,335
Kellyn. So is this the right thing to do?

609
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,901
We play Survivor.

610
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:20,226
Is the easy shot ever 
the shot to play?

611
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:21,466
I do not know.

612
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,215
It looks easy.

613
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:27,278
And then you think 
of the king of idols sitting there,

614
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:30,515
you have to redo your calculations, 
and that's scary.

615
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,859
Tonight, here, I am very, very afraid.

616
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:38,163
Wendell. Is it 
like jungle animals?

617
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:39,915
The predator and the prey.

618
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,504
By dint, they come to feel 
that something is wrong.

619
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:45,179
Are you talking about this?

620
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:49,062
The question is whether 
or not you believe that a person has an idol,

621
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:53,196
then you study it to find out 
whether it is telling the truth or not.

622
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:54,553
Absolutely, Jeff.

623
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:57,249
Eyes have been on Michael 
since day 1.

624
00:34:57,374 --> 00:35:01,031
I mean, watch it, first! 
Finally, of course!

625
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:03,856
At least take it! 
Thanks, Kellyn.

626
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:07,206
Domenick. You meant...?

627
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:10,598
I wanted to mention 
to the people I work with

628
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:14,907
that I know Michael is known 
for finding idols, but...

629
00:35:15,686 --> 00:35:17,386
We shouldn't panic.

630
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:19,132
I stick to my plan,

631
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:22,474
because at this point, I haven't seen anything. 
I don't believe he has it.

632
00:35:22,981 --> 00:35:26,245
Michael. What logic would there be 
to show him the idol,

633
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:29,795
knowing that there are five of you and 
the only other choice is Laurel?

634
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,110
I do not know. 
Maybe to influence the vote.

635
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:35,392
Otherwise, it wouldn't make much sense.

636
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:38,401
The prey 
knows when there are predators.

637
00:35:38,526 --> 00:35:41,203
It's something 
I'd rather hide

638
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:43,751
and play to save me 
once again.

639
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,976
It holds.

640
00:35:46,402 --> 00:35:48,861
Laurel. Your position 
becomes very interesting.

641
00:35:48,986 --> 00:35:51,430
Because all eyes 
are on Michael.

642
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,997
There is this question. 
What if he had an idol?

643
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:57,022
You could attempt 
to join Naviti and say:

644
00:35:57,147 --> 00:35:58,447
"I walk with you."

645
00:35:58,572 --> 00:36:00,236
But you might fall prey.

646
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:03,651
First, I'm jealous, 
no one said I was pretty!

647
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:07,350
A few compliments 
would be nice, but...

648
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:10,578
I saw Libby's spell 
when they aimed for it

649
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:11,955
and failed, so...

650
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,569
It's the same.

651
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:17,453
My game hinges 
on their reading of Michael.

652
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,141
Wendell. Do you fear 
that if you are wrong tonight,

653
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,802
is that messing up your game? 
Absolutely.

654
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:27,172
If we aim wrong 
and an innocent onlooker is hit,

655
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:28,470
like a Libby,

656
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:30,181
it has implications

657
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:32,324
and that will have repercussions.

658
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:35,468
So we're trying 
to aim for the best tonight.

659
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:39,136
Kellyn. These are the kind of moments 
we dream of

660
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:41,072
when you dream 
of participating in Survivor.

661
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:42,708
A big question arises.

662
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,088
If we are wrong, we fail.

663
00:36:45,408 --> 00:36:47,902
And now Dom is talking to Wendell!

664
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:49,497
There is no certainty.

665
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:51,680
I hope 
they recite the alphabet to each other,

666
00:36:51,805 --> 00:36:55,746
because I thought everything was over 
before I came here.

667
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:58,437
Does it make you nervous?

668
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:02,254
I was already before! 
Of course I still am!

669
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:04,959
I have a one in four chance of leaving.

670
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:06,243
One in four.

671
00:37:06,368 --> 00:37:09,904
And so far, you're not included 
in the Naviti discussion.

672
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,135
Wow, Laurel, how do you feel?

673
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,241
That's what being Malolo is.

674
00:37:17,372 --> 00:37:20,858
It's the same on the camp, 
they discuss and make asides.

675
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:25,147
I imagine they're debating whether 
to target Michael or not.

676
00:37:25,272 --> 00:37:28,078
For me, they were planning to target him,

677
00:37:28,203 --> 00:37:30,752
they talked and probably 
changed their minds, so...

678
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:33,068
There, I think it's for my apple.

679
00:37:33,193 --> 00:37:35,457
Kellyn. If Survivor 
is a rollercoaster,

680
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:37,309
where are we on the journey?

681
00:37:37,573 --> 00:37:39,947
For me, we are in the loop

682
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:41,914
and I'm hanging upside down!

683
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:43,632
Very unpleasant position!

684
00:37:43,757 --> 00:37:45,224
And as long as no one comes

685
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:47,386
to make us go away,

686
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:49,934
I guess 
we are waiting for this next vote.

687
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,628
Good. It's time to vote.

688
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:53,902
Laurel, over to you.

689
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:43,905
I will count the votes.

690
00:38:52,536 --> 00:38:55,237
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

691
00:38:55,362 --> 00:38:56,994
now is the time to do it.

692
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:06,134
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

693
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:08,896
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

694
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:10,494

00:39:57,032 --> 00:39:59,431
Laurel and Michael, 
you're not voting.

707
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:01,093
Domenick, Wendell, Kellyn,

708
00:40:01,218 --> 00:40:03,436
you can only vote 
for one of them.

709
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:05,654
Domenick, over to you. 
Come and take the ballot box.

710
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:19,516
There were six votes.

711
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:21,599
Someone had an extra vote.

712
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:32,588
I will count the votes.

713
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:43,832

00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,249

Michael. Two is enough. 
Bring me your torch.

717
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,149
My brother. 
You rock, you hear me?

718
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:05,484
I appreciate.

719
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:08,020
I love you.

720
00:41:10,503 --> 00:41:12,257
Nobody kissed me.

721
00:41:16,397 --> 00:41:18,296
Michael, the tribe has spoken.

722
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:23,635
It was exceptional. Vinaka. 
Hello my brother.

723
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:38,618
Well, everyone 
who could receive votes

724
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:40,056
have received them.

725
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:42,980
And with the rest of the tribe 
waiting for you at the camp,

726
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:45,854
the discussions around the fire 
should be interesting.

727
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,568
Take your torches, 
return to the camp. Good night.

728
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:08,513
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

729
00:42:11,537 --> 00:42:13,908
Next time in Survivor...

730
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:16,105
Most are on dangerous ground.

731
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,223
He doesn't care, it annoys me!

732
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:21,289
Naviti's happy family 
is over.

733
00:42:21,442 --> 00:42:23,385
But blood ties take precedence.

734
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,529
If you could share this moment 
with those you play for?

735
00:42:27,654 --> 00:42:28,936
I speak of love!

736
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:36,268
Even if I failed, 
I can be proud of myself.

737
00:42:36,393 --> 00:42:38,420
I am the youngest here.

738
00:42:38,545 --> 00:42:41,813
Unbeknownst to them, they were fooled 
each time by an 18-year-old guy.

739
00:42:41,938 --> 00:42:45,380
At 18, my life is just beginning.

740
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:47,958
I've been watching the show 
for so long.

741
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:50,754
Living such an experience 
is priceless.
