1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Previously on Survivor.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,440
At the Millennial Tribe.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,160
Figgy flirted with the men.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,160
And put together an alliance of four.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,280
But the tribe was catching on.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,280
We need to tear apart that popular group.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,760
At the Gen X tribe, David was scared of everything.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,400
This girl's got more testosterone back at that camp than he's got.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,200
You see the alliance being formed?

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,200
While a majority alliance came together.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
It's either Rachel or David.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
I have six people.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,200
I think we're in good shape.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,200
At tribal council, David pled his case.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
I don't want to go home tonight.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
In the end, he was spared and Rachel was sent home.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Rachel, the tribe was spoken.

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Nineteen are left.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Who will be voted out tonight?

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,060
The

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,200
Alliance.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:07,200
It's not lightning.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
This is getting embarrassing.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
That's crazy, dude.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
Here we are at day five and we still don't have a fire.

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Other than that, everything's going ahead as planned.

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
I got a six-person alliance.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
And I'm going to say it like it is.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
For Cece and David, they don't have a chance.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Cece aligned herself with Rachel, which was a kiss of death.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,200
When you guys get tired, I'm happy to take a whack at it.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Go for it.

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
With David, he just can't handle it out here.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
All right, come on, Dave, man.

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
No pressure.

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Yeah.

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Crazy.

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Here we go.

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Watch makers.

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Right now, I think I'm playing a miserable survivor game.

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
So I really want to be a hero for my tribe and bring them fire

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
because I'm so grateful for them sparing me last night at tribal.

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I really need to prove myself today.

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,200
And it's in line with a Generation X attitude in that you don't ever give up.

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,200
But I'm more of a Cochran than I am an Aussie.

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Why does this fire hate us so much?

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Come on, Dave.

48
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,200
There we go.

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Keep going.

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
I think I got something, guys.

51
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Go, go, go, go.

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Get it, Dave.

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Whoa, baby, get it, man.

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
You are reborn hard, my friend.

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Don't smother it.

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Don't smother it.

57
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Nice, nice.

58
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
That is awesome, dude.

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Well, good work, Dave.

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
You did it, man.

61
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Oddly enough, Dave, out of all of us, got a flame going.

62
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Look at the hell this kid been.

63
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Good job, Dave.

64
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Can you break that in half for me?

65
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
But he's still going home next.

66
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Dave's probably the weakest challenge person we have.

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
I have to cut it.

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
He's like our puppy dog right now.

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,200
We're trying to keep petting him until we get rid of him.

70
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
What do you think, if I collect big rocks that we can like sit on around us?

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
We're just keeping him busy.

72
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,200
If you let him get in his own head, that's when he goes nuts and starts looking for idols

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and getting all paranoid.

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
I would love an idol, but contribute to the tribe first.

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
And while doing that, just kind of be looking around.

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Because looking for rocks and looking for the idol, they both make you dirty.

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
So this is an alibi.

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Here one.

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Attaboy.

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
I guess not.

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Whoa.

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Ants and spiders.

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Oh, Dave, you got another big ride.

84
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:43,200
One more.

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Oh, my God. It's in here, isn't it?

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Oh, my God. I just got to split this open.

89
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Holy, holy crap.

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

91
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Get out of there.

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Yes.

93
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Oh, my God. This is why we come to play Survivor.

94
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Congratulations. You've found the hidden immunity idol.

95
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
If you use an idol and you have the highest ESXs,

96
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
all that's going to be down in this window.

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Same old rules. And now I have the hidden immunity idol.

98
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
I never, ever thought this was going to happen for me,

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
especially on the nadir that I was on.

100
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
And now I'm at a zenith. This is amazing.

101
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
This is so perfect. This is exactly what I need.

102
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,200
To have the confidence to really make big strategic moves right now.

103
00:04:47,200 --> 00:05:02,200
This is like serendipity.

104
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I'll probably never leave the West Coast.

105
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I feel like if I ever move there, I'll never go back east.

106
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Let's move to LA.

107
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Okay. Done.

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I really like Viggs. She's super rad, easy to be around.

109
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,200
I mean, she's really beautiful.

110
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,200
And it's just like, love goggles.

111
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,200
And Viggs is directly in front of me.

112
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
It's like taking shots before.

113
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,200
No, I didn't. I gave him a hockey or something.

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I didn't come here for romance, but oh, my God, those blue eyes,

115
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
they are dangerous.

116
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Getting pretty good at this.

117
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,200
They're just gorgeous. They're so beautiful.

118
00:05:47,200 --> 00:06:09,200
And I get to cuddle up with that. I'm just like, looks fine.

119
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
The middle of the night, I hear a kiss sound.

120
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
And I was like, y'all can't be for real.

121
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
You stink, your mouth is nasty.

122
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,200
You got sand in your drawers and you kissing somebody.

123
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,200
That's disgusting.

124
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I heard y'all kissing.

125
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
You kissed her last night?

126
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Look at her!

127
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
You kissed her.

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,200
My dude kissed her already.

129
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Me and Viggs got called out on Mackin.

130
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,200
And I look at that as a risky move, but millennials are dreamers.

131
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
And I'm dreaming big.

132
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Micaela's like, yeah, I was just like.

133
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
You guys are so pretty.

134
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,200
My tribe doesn't even consider Taylor and myself being a power couple threat.

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
And maybe it's because we're the millennials.

136
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Only people, Kof, Kof, and Micaela are going to try to throw it out there

137
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:18,200
and set a target on our backs. But nobody cares.

138
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Tay and Figgy keep isolating themselves.

139
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Did you see them all like snuggled up last night?

140
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Micaela said that she heard them already kissing.

141
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,200
I think the millennial generation takes hookups a lot less seriously

142
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
than maybe the Gen Xers do.

143
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,200
And I think it's that casual attitude which might be getting Taylor and Figgy into trouble.

144
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Because you need to have the mentality that you're also playing Survivor.

145
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
And I think they might be missing that part.

146
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
They were just like on top of each other.

147
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
It's too tight. Like no one's going to be able to split it up.

148
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
That's not fair.

149
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
What do you think, girls?

150
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Love in paradise.

151
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Figgy and Taylor are freaking stupid, man.

152
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,200
No couple ever lasts on Survivor. Ever.

153
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Me and Michelle are still in alliance with them.

154
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,200
And this power couple can destroy everything that we've created.

155
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Taylor's my boy. I love that kid.

156
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,200
But sometimes women blind you and then you end up stuck with a woman

157
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,200
and you're bailing on your boys when it's bowling night

158
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
and you're stuck at home with your girlfriend.

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,200
You're a dork. Like, wake up.

160
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I'm going to tell you this because I'm your boy.

161
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Power couples don't last.

162
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Imagine something goes down. What's going to happen?

163
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
One by one, we'll get picked off.

164
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Yeah.

165
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm not losing a million dollars. Yeah.

166
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I need that. And I know you need that.

167
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Yeah.

168
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
You want to snowboard and chill?

169
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I thought it all the way through.

170
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
That's how I'm going to play this game.

171
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Taylor is so oblivious to the fact that, dude, it's not going to work

172
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
because he's so just infatuated with Figgy.

173
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,200
But this power couple, it's like a bullseye for a nuclear missile.

174
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
That's how big it is.

175
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:02,200
It's like, yo, this is where we need to blow up because this is not good.

176
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I'm going to get it.

177
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Spear fishing and surviving in this kind of environment,

178
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
it's something I've always done my entire life and something I'm good at.

179
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,200
But in a social game like this, you have to develop connections and bonds.

180
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
And I'm socially shy sometimes.

181
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
It's something that's plagued me my entire life.

182
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Octopus. Nice, man. Awesome score.

183
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
This is octopus prime.

184
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Octopus prime.

185
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Yeah.

186
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I was the kid with the speech impediments and the nervous twitches.

187
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
And so David and I are kind of mirrors of each other.

188
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Socially, we're a little bit awkward. We're a little bit shy.

189
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
What am I doing with this?

190
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Sushi.

191
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
No.

192
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
And as I see him opening it up, it's inspiring me to open it up.

193
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
This is going to be so good, man. Thanks for getting this.

194
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
You're welcome.

195
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
It's hard to know exactly what the divisions are.

196
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I mean, yeah, Paul's obviously...

197
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I see it as Paul's posse.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
It is, yeah. It's Paul's posse, yeah.

199
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
I mean, you're cool enough to be letting the group.

200
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
That's kind of how it feels.

201
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,200
But there's two things that you and I can do.

202
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Stay where we're at on the bottom and just wait to get picked off or...

203
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Decide to make a move of some kind.

204
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Decide to make a move and break the line.

205
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Break the line, yeah.

206
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Right now, right now, it's Paul's party.

207
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Yeah.

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Whatever we can do to just stay strong, the two of us.

209
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Yeah.

210
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Ken and I, we are on opposite sides of the science spectrum.

211
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I don't look like anything like Ken.

212
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
He's built like a super athlete.

213
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
He looks like an Adonis.

214
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Yeah, what girl wouldn't want to date him?

215
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
No girl doesn't want to really date a neurotic bald guy.

216
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
But I like Ken a lot.

217
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,200
And in Survivor, you absolutely need at least one person that you can trust.

218
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
And for me right now, it's Ken.

219
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
And I think for Ken, it's me.

220
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
I'm full of trust. It's got the instructions and everything. This is it.

221
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
And like I said, you're it for me as far as trust.

222
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
But don't, please don't tell anyone.

223
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,200
No, we're golden. We're brothers.

224
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Yeah.

225
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
I believe in Dave and I's alliance. It's real. It's legit.

226
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,200
And Dave as an idol, I think we'll be using that to band together and do something big.

227
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
And for us to move forward, Paul's got to go.

228
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
You know, we're ready for a fight.

229
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
And I don't want to give Paul too much time to come in and try to counter him.

230
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Huh? Huh?

231
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Come on.

232
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Am I making progress on this thing?

233
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
You're making progress.

234
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Okay. It's day six and the Millennials morale is good.

235
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,200
But we didn't realize playing this game would be so hard.

236
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
As Millennials, we grew up with a television screen in front of our faces.

237
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
And it's not reality.

238
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Bring it down hard.

239
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Whoa.

240
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Okay.

241
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
You all right?

242
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Yeah, I'm good.

243
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,200
But nothing that you experience on a television screen can carry the same weight as experiencing it in real life.

244
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
And it is surreal, man.

245
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Oh my God.

246
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
There you go.

247
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
You did it.

248
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I did.

249
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
It's making a surfboard.

250
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,200
We need a piece of wood.

251
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
You're supposed to make me a comb.

252
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
You made me a bracelet, but you're going to make me a comb.

253
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I think he's been a flirt since the boat come up to Fiji.

254
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Like, this girl is dumb.

255
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
You're supposed to kind of blend in a little at the beginning and work your magic behind the scenes.

256
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
But her magic is trying to be all over the place.

257
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
So it's not magic.

258
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Like, you need to pull the bunny out the hat.

259
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
You just can't walk in with the bunny.

260
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,200
The problem is, it's hard to act like I don't know what's going on.

261
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:18,200
If I have something to say and I'm not saying it, my mouth will close, but my eyebrows and this face will talk.

262
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
You ain't going to be nervous with that machete.

263
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Yeah.

264
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Don't worry, it wouldn't be angry, too.

265
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
What was that?

266
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh my God, dude.

267
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Oh.

268
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Wow.

269
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Michelle's safe.

270
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm getting hit by a machete.

271
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
That's good.

272
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
The odds are dwindling.

273
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Oh, it's me.

274
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
What do you do?

275
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm trying to figure that out.

276
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
You got some good amnesia, girl.

277
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
It's only been six days.

278
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I know, but why are you being phony then if you want to keep it real?

279
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Whoa, why am I being phony?

280
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Yeah, if I'm trying to get to know you.

281
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
You have to be quiet, girl.

282
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm just going to whisper to Taylor some more.

283
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Okay, baby.

284
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Just keep eating that sugar cane.

285
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
I will.

286
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Tastes delicious.

287
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Good for you.

288
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Mikaela is being a complete bitch about nothing.

289
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
This girl is crazy.

290
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I want her far away from me as possible.

291
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
This girl's got to go.

292
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
This is what's going to pass here real quick.

293
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Okay.

294
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Now I'm having fun.

295
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Literally, Figgy's put herself in the crosshairs.

296
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Basic laws of survival will tell you don't come blazing out of the gate.

297
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
This is crazy.

298
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Don't get into a cat fight.

299
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm not.

300
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,200
And sure as hell, don't get yourself into a showman's.

301
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
We got this.

302
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,200
We're good.

303
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Any firewood you see, that's going to be our next problem.

304
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Okay.

305
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Anybody walking that sees any dry driftwood that you can physically carry, bring it.

306
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
All right.

307
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Dry.

308
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
With me, it's very simple.

309
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,200
When it comes to taking control of the game, I 100% want to be in control.

310
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
That's where I have to be.

311
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I don't have a choice.

312
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I breathe control.

313
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
It's the ball show in his eyes.

314
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Yeah.

315
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I don't think he's looking out for anyone else.

316
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
We're on the outside.

317
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Me, you and Dave are on the outside.

318
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
For sure.

319
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
And I'm not okay with that.

320
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Yeah, I'm not okay with it either.

321
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
52-year-old legs.

322
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
So I'm curious what you thought.

323
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Cut off the head.

324
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
And that was my first thought.

325
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
You got to get him out.

326
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
And what's the head?

327
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Paul.

328
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Exactly.

329
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Something with guys like Paul, when the ego is really big like that, you got to feed it.

330
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
You need it.

331
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
You need it.

332
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
You need it.

333
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
You need it.

334
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
You got to feed it.

335
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
And they don't make mistakes.

336
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Nothing to touch them.

337
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Want some more water?

338
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Just give me just a second, all right?

339
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,200
I think with this move, we can move from the bottom of our drive to possibly the top of

340
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
this game.

341
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
That would be so great.

342
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm with it.

343
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Paul's down.

344
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Oh, God.

345
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
You ready to go up a little bit?

346
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Oh, yeah.

347
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:57,200
That's right, buddy.

348
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
We got you.

349
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I'm back here.

350
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Yeah, I got you.

351
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Just lean back.

352
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
We're here.

353
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Lean back.

354
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
That's right, buddy.

355
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Christmas.

356
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
You had enough, man.

357
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Keep drinking.

358
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
You want to lay down?

359
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Yeah, we got it.

360
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Try that.

361
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
If he scoots you over, he's going to share with you.

362
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Guys, we want everyone to back up and get you some grills.

363
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Okay.

364
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
We're going to come in now.

365
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
We're going to check your pulse.

366
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Don't try to get up.

367
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
We're here with you.

368
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
We're here with you.

369
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Okay.

370
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Don't worry.

371
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Dr. Joe's on his way.

372
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
I'm scared.

373
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I know you're scared.

374
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I just want you to focus on the breathing right now.

375
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Just here.

376
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
You're in good hands right now.

377
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
I got it.

378
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
The doctor's here shortly.

379
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
My chest.

380
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Hey, Ty, relax.

381
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Relax.

382
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
You got to breathe.

383
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Hey, you got to breathe, buddy.

384
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I got it.

385
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
You got to breathe.

386
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
You got to breathe.

387
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Breathe.

388
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Breathe.

389
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Breathe, pa.

390
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Deep breaths, buddy.

391
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Deep breaths.

392
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
You're doing good, buddy.

393
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
The benefits here.

394
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Come up.

395
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Come up now.

396
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Come up the hill.

397
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Back up.

398
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Okay.

399
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
What's the main thing that's bothering you at the moment?

400
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Just relax for a minute.

401
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
My hands are being numb.

402
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
And it's doing that on both hands.

403
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Right to my elbows.

404
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm like, shit.

405
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Ty, I'm going to die.

406
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Shit, Ty.

407
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
So dizzy.

408
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
So you're still feeling dizzy?

409
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
And the cramps.

410
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Okay.

411
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Nice deep breaths.

412
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
In between these cramps, you need to get as much of that water down here.

413
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Okay.

414
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
So nice little sips.

415
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Okay, you keep going with that.

416
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
We have the chopper coming in.

417
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Give us the update.

418
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
We're going to do a quick tracer's heart.

419
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
It would warn us if there's signs that you might have had a heart attack.

420
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
All right.

421
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Let's do it.

422
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Okay.

423
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Okay.

424
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Okay.

425
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Okay.

426
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Okay.

427
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Okay.

428
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Okay.

429
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Okay.

430
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Okay.

431
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Okay.

432
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Okay.

433
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Okay.

434
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Okay.

435
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Okay.

436
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Okay.

437
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Okay.

438
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Okay.

439
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
I'm not going to lie, I'm a little scared.

440
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
I've never gone down like this.

441
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm not in control, you know.

442
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
I'm always in control.

443
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Try to relax a little.

444
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Okay.

445
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
It's extremely scary.

446
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,200
See him go down makes you think, okay, if that can happen to him, it can happen to anybody.

447
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
And I really, really need Pablo to stay in the game.

448
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Huge key part of our alliance.

449
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,200
But beyond that, I just care about him.

450
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,200
And it's just come through now.

451
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Okay.

452
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,200
And it looks like there's no sign of any damage to your heart therefore.

453
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Okay.

454
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Good.

455
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
You're all right.

456
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
You're all right.

457
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
The story fits with the diagnosis.

458
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Early heat exhaustion and a bit of dehydration, which is now settled.

459
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
So, here's what we're going to do.

460
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Dr. Joe, you're comfortable.

461
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
We're sending the chopper back.

462
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
No need for that.

463
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
All right.

464
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
The game is back on.

465
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Thanks, Doc.

466
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Thanks, guys.

467
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Thank you.

468
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I feel so guilty saying this, and I'm glad Paul didn't have a heart attack.

469
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,200
But honestly, when he went down, I thought this might be a good thing for me.

470
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Because he's the one I want to vote out.

471
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
And he's really calling all the shots.

472
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,200
And being so weak right now, that's going to make it easier to convince people that, you know what, it might be time to get rid of Paul.

473
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
You got any bad news?

474
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Yes.

475
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,200
All right, millennials, getting your first look at the new Gen X tribe.

476
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Rachel voted out at the first tribal council.

477
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Sounds about right.

478
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?

479
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Yeah.

480
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,200
First things first, I need that idol back so, millennials, you can swim it over to me.

481
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Thanks, sir.

482
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs.

483
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:52,200
For today's challenge, one person from each tribe is going to dive in the water, race up the cargo net, leap off a platform, and retrieve a key.

484
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
And the next person goes.

485
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Once you've retrieved all five keys, you'll use them to open a chest containing a mask.

486
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Use that mask to dive down and retrieve five rings.

487
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,200
You'll then attempt to land those rings on a series of targets.

488
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,200
First tribe to finish wins immunity safe from the vote.

489
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,200
In addition, you are playing for reward.

490
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
All know what you're playing for?

491
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Yes.

492
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Winning tribe gets a target.

493
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Woo!

494
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
The point is, you have one extra person going to sit somebody out.

495
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Who's it going to be?

496
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
I'll sit out.

497
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Hannah, you'll be with me.

498
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Everybody else, give me a minute to strategize.

499
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
We'll get started.

500
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
All right, here we go.

501
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
For immunity and reward.

502
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Survivors ready?

503
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Go!

504
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
It's Chris and Michelle out of the gate.

505
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Chris is ripping through the water.

506
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Michelle, you're ripping through the water too.

507
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Gets to the platform first.

508
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
He's up the cargo net.

509
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
You got it, baby.

510
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
And he's got a key.

511
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Michelle jumps.

512
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
She's got a key.

513
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,200
You got to get all the way to your platform and your key on your stand before the next person can go.

514
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Go, Gen X, go Millennials!

515
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,200
It is Paul in the water and Will in the water.

516
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Paul gets through the water very quickly.

517
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Will right on his tail.

518
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Go, Will!

519
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Paul gets a key.

520
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Will gets a key.

521
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
We are still dead even.

522
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,200
You got to get that key on the stand.

523
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Go, Gen X!

524
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Go, Millennials!

525
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,200
It's Sunday in the water for Gen X and Michaela in the water for Millennials.

526
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Three keys left.

527
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Sunday moving quickly.

528
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
She's already up the cargo net.

529
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Michaela right on her tail.

530
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Sunday just gets it.

531
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Michaela gets it.

532
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Got to get it on there.

533
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Go, Gen X!

534
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Go, Millennials!

535
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,200
It's David in the water and Zeke.

536
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
You got this, Zeke!

537
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Zeke is now passing David.

538
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Millennials now in the lead.

539
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Zeke is killing it.

540
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
David's struggling on the cargo net.

541
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Challenge proving very difficult for David.

542
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Taking a lot of time.

543
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
He's got a man.

544
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
And he's got it.

545
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Zeke extending the lead for the Millennials.

546
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Go, Adam!

547
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
David really struggling in the water.

548
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Giving a huge lead to the Millennials.

549
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Adam has the key for the Millennials.

550
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Go, Gen X!

551
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Jessica now in the water for Gen X.

552
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
You're good!

553
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Millennials now opening their chests.

554
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Jessica got her key.

555
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Jessica needs to make up a lot of time for Gen X.

556
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Viggy has the chest open.

557
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
She's got the mask.

558
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Jessica now back.

559
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Go, Gen X!

560
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Viggy's going to go first.

561
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Viggy has the first ring.

562
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Brett has the mask.

563
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,200
It's going to be Cece in the water first for Gen X.

564
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
It is now Jay in the water for the Millennials.

565
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Cece can't get a ring.

566
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
She's coming back.

567
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,200
That's going to cost Gen X even more time.

568
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
And now Lucy in the water for Gen X.

569
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Jay up with the second ring for the Millennials.

570
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Go, it's going to be Mari now for the Millennials.

571
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Lucy finally comes up with that first ring.

572
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Brett now in the water for Gen X.

573
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
And Brett has the second ring.

574
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Gen X is back in this now.

575
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Ken putting on the mask.

576
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Ken in the water now for Gen X.

577
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Mari has been under a long time.

578
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
And here she is.

579
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Mari up with the third ring for the Millennials.

580
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
It is three, two.

581
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Ken up quickly with the third ring for Gen X.

582
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
We are tied.

583
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Taylor going to get in the water for the Millennials now.

584
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Taylor back up with the fourth ring for the Millennials.

585
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Ken back up with the fourth ring for Gen X.

586
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
We are neck and neck.

587
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Here goes Jay with a big dive.

588
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Brett back in the water for Gen X.

589
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Both looking for that fifth and final ring.

590
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:08,200
It is Jay for the Millennials and Brett right behind him for Gen X.

591
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Tossing the rings for the Millennials.

592
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
It is Jay.

593
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Got to get five rings total.

594
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
It is Cece for Gen X.

595
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Cece has the first ring for Gen X.

596
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
They are now in the lead.

597
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Cece with the second ring.

598
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Jay has the first ring for the Millennials.

599
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Jay with the second ring.

600
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
We are tied two, two.

601
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Gen X is back in this.

602
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Ken snags the third ring.

603
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Gen X in the lead, three, two.

604
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,200
The Millennials have given up a huge lead and now trail.

605
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Ken with the fourth ring for Gen X.

606
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Jay snags the third ring.

607
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Gen X down to their last ring.

608
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
They could win it right here.

609
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
And he does it.

610
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Gen X wins immunity and reward.

611
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Sending Millennials to tribal councils.

612
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,200
All right, Gen X, who wants to come get immunity?

613
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Congrats.

614
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Dr. Joe brought this old pirate back from the dead, baby.

615
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Immunity for Gen X.

616
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,200
No tribal council, nobody going home.

617
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
The tarp will be waiting for you back at camp.

618
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Enjoy the night off.

619
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:46,200
All right, Millennials, got nothing for you except to date with me tonight at tribal council where somebody will be the second person voted out of this game.

620
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
See you tonight at tribal.

621
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Tonight, we want Fakie to be really comfortable and we want to blindside her without her even knowing.

622
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,200
When I beat an opponent in a video game, it feels great, but this is a person's dream that we're crushing.

623
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
And I think this is what makes Survivor real.

624
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,200
We lost today's immunity challenge, but you know, I'm a little bit tickled to be going to tribal council.

625
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,200
I came to vote people out and I came to win a million dollars and I want to get started.

626
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Fakie's in the hot seat right now because wherever Fakie goes, her little puppy dog Taylor goes.

627
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Like one person's not allowed to have two votes.

628
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
That's against the spirit of the game.

629
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I don't trust Fakie.

630
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,200
I think Fakie is the source of a lot of the consternation.

631
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Her and Taylor are super close.

632
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
That's dangerous.

633
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Okay, what are the chances that she's going to see blindside coming?

634
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I don't think she will.

635
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
I don't think she will either.

636
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,200
I'm excited we can finally go to tribal council and get it over with.

637
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,200
We just want to make sure we got the idea straight down the unlock, you know what I'm saying?

638
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Everybody vote Fakie.

639
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,200
The couple would be dangerous if Fakie was going to stay around, but I'm just convinced that Fakie's going home.

640
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,200
So get your kisses in because that couple is about to go back down to one real quick.

641
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I think we got to break up this too, so you know.

642
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Now?

643
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Yeah.

644
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Fakie is going home, and it sucks because I had Fakie and Taylor in the trifecta, okay?

645
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
And we were going to make things happen.

646
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Hopefully Fakie being gone will bring Michaela into the group.

647
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Yeah.

648
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
But if she doesn't, then I think like.

649
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Next.

650
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Yeah.

651
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
I'm okay with that.

652
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Unless something happens and things go crazy, which they usually do, my alliance is gone.

653
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm just upset.

654
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Okay, what are you upset about?

655
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
They want to figure out first.

656
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,200
But you realize that we're losing numbers if we vote off Fakie.

657
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
It doesn't make sense to get rid of Fakie right now.

658
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,200
My alliance with Jay, Fakie, and Taylor, we got to keep that number and we got to switch the vote.

659
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I think we take out Mari.

660
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Unless you have a better idea.

661
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
I'm fine with it.

662
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Okay.

663
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Mari is really dangerous because she's smart, but tonight's tribal council is about keeping people who I know will stick with me moving forward.

664
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
We need to figure out Michaela to kiss and make up.

665
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
If possible, we need to because we need to figure out.

666
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Figure you, me too.

667
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
We need to figure out.

668
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I want to tell you both, I like both of you.

669
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Zeke told me they want you gone first.

670
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Wait, what?

671
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
First, we take out Fakie because she's the one running the show.

672
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
That's what he said.

673
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Second, we take out Michaela because that's an easy vote.

674
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
My name is on the chopping block.

675
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,200
It's like hitting you in the chest, you know, with a knife.

676
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Michaela and I have definitely had our differences, but she has to stick with us.

677
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
There's nothing else to it.

678
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
I don't want this, Michaela.

679
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
I want to work with you.

680
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
I don't know where this came from.

681
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
I don't know what I did.

682
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
I really don't.

683
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
This girl's trying to be my friend now.

684
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Figgy was going home, and I was perfectly fine with that.

685
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,200
But if Jay's telling the truth, I could definitely be in trouble.

686
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
So this whole thing is up in the air.

687
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
What we have to do is we have to keep six strong.

688
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Michelle, who are these six?

689
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,200
One, two, three, Michelle, Will, and Tails.

690
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
We need Will.

691
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,200
We both know what Figgy's up to, like, and what she's capable of.

692
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
So it's easy later.

693
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Figgy is the kind of person where if you give her a little bit of momentum,

694
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
she will go all the way to the end.

695
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
You know, I've seen Parity do it.

696
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
I've seen John Cochran do it.

697
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
It's scary.

698
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Who would you want, Dawn?

699
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Mari.

700
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
You do?

701
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,200
She's a strategic player, and she's really strong.

702
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
This is nerve-racking, like, changing the plan, like, a minute, like, hours before.

703
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,200
I know, but Figgy, I think, if we need to, is an easy vote later.

704
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I see what you're saying. You have a lot of very good points, but it's just, it makes me nervous.

705
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
This First Tribal Council is going to draw a line.

706
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Figgy can't go tonight.

707
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
It has to be someone else.

708
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,200
It's scary to me because I'm not sure we have the numbers to really, truly save Figgy.

709
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:39,200
So I might have to try to pull strings at Tribal Council to make sure I have the numbers and get what I want.

710
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Behind each of you is a torch.

711
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Go ahead and grab a torch, dip it in and get fire.

712
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
You're about to see what we have here.

713
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
This is the first Tribal Council meeting.

714
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
First Tribal Council meeting in the next 60 minutes.

715
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Welcome to Tribal Council.

716
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
First Tribal Council meeting.

717
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,200
This is the first Tribal Council meeting in the next 60 minutes.

718
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,200
So we're going to get things going, and it's going to be exciting.

719
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
We're going to get things going.

720
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
We're going to get things going.

721
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,200
This is part of the ritual at tribal council,

722
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,200
because in this game, fire represents your life.

723
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,200
When your fire's gone, so are you.

724
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,200
So Adam, let's talk about this look on your face.

725
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
We haven't even started.

726
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
First of all, this place is unbelievable.

727
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
It's beautiful.

728
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,200
I feel like I'm inside my television right now.

729
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,200
I'm in front of Jeff Probst, and it's a terrible night, right?

730
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Like, this sucks.

731
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Mari, one of the raps on the Millennials

732
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
is that because of technology, you don't call anymore,

733
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
you break up over text.

734
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Does that make a Millennial better at social dynamics?

735
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,200
My world is a two-dimensional world.

736
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,200
I would play a game in my monitor like this where it's easy,

737
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,200
but to do it with real-life people,

738
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
it's a completely different thing.

739
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
I think it's empathy and emotion.

740
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
When you see people's eyeballs

741
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
and you see their soul through them,

742
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,200
you get to know these people and start to care about them.

743
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Zeke, does it surprise you that you're out here

744
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
and you've made a shelter? You have fire.

745
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Oh, my God. I'm like living in a dream world.

746
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Like, I started fire without Flint.

747
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Like, excuse me?

748
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
This is the adventure of a lifetime, right?

749
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,200
And I feel like I'm my best version of myself out here

750
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
because I want to give all of myself out here,

751
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,200
because, like, everything about this experience is incredible.

752
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Michaela, it's very interesting what Zeke just said,

753
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
that because of the experience,

754
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,200
it makes you want to give your best self.

755
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Do you feel that?

756
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
No, not necessarily.

757
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,200
I feel like the situations you're in here

758
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
can bring out the worst things.

759
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Wow, so everything's not rosy.

760
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,200
No, not for me at least.

761
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Adam, are you surprised that Michaela's so forthcoming?

762
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
I mean, I get Michaela, right?

763
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Like, she's a straight shooter.

764
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
That's a great quality to have as a person,

765
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,200
but that's a tough trait to have on day one in the game of Survivor.

766
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,200
But it is my natural reaction to observe,

767
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
and I saw a lot of things.

768
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
I saw little groups forming,

769
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
little whispers in the middle of the night.

770
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,200
People act like just because I wasn't in the circle,

771
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
I couldn't influence any circles.

772
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Wow, game is clearly on at Camp Millennial.

773
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,200
So, Hannah, we talked about who feels like they're on the outside.

774
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Who did you notice instantly bonding?

775
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,200
You know, we all cuddle for warmth in this shelter.

776
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Some people like cuddling a little more than other people.

777
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
I don't blame them. They're both very pretty.

778
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Who are we talking about, Hannah?

779
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
I'm talking about Taylor and Figgy.

780
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
That's not a secret.

781
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,200
If the shelters are rocking, don't come and knock it down.

782
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
So, Taylor, this is out in the open. This is not a secret.

783
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Oh, yeah. We got called out, Macken and the Shack.

784
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Oh, my God.

785
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,200
So you guys are full-on making out.

786
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
No.

787
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,200
I second whatever she says, Jeff.

788
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Yeah, we're learning.

789
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,200
But, Will, it is complicated.

790
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,200
There's an assumption that these two will be voting together,

791
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
and that's two votes.

792
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Yeah, when you're cuddling in the shelter

793
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,200
and maybe or maybe not making out with each other,

794
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
there is definitely an assumption

795
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
that the two of them are working together.

796
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Zeke, what's your take?

797
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Does this tribe mind that they're together?

798
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Uh, it's definitely not good.

799
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Figgy's always gonna be a little bit more loyal to Taylor

800
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
than she would be loyal to me, right?

801
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
No, it's just funny at this point,

802
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
because we kind of all kid around at camp about it.

803
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
You know, I think we're early enough

804
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
to where it shouldn't be a concern in this tribe.

805
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Seriously, yeah.

806
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Michaela, that got a reaction from you.

807
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Yeah, I'm not stupid.

808
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
It's like they're telling you,

809
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
I think you're so dumb that I can lie straight to your face

810
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
and you're not gonna find out.

811
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Wow.

812
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
So, Michaela, there's clearly animosity.

813
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Not to the tribe.

814
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
It flutters with, like, a particular person.

815
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Who's the particular person?

816
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
One in the middle, Miss Cuddleshag.

817
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
What? What about me?

818
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
See how she played dumb?

819
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
No, I was listening to a conversation.

820
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Are we doing this again?

821
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Mm, okay.

822
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

823
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
It's like a peanut gallery over there, man.

824
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Wow, I'm fascinated with this.

825
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Jay, there's another entire conversation

826
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
happening between Michelle and Hannah.

827
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
This is not a surprise at all.

828
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Okay.

829
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Everyone is young, energetic, and paranoid

830
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
to the point where it's just, like, too much.

831
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
So, Hannah?

832
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Yeah, I don't know.

833
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
It's dizzy.

834
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I feel like the more I'm out here, the more I just...

835
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Sorry.

836
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
It's your Jeff Probst.

837
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
We're in tribal council. It's all very confusing.

838
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Did I miss an entire conversation?

839
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Yeah, I've just given you an answer

840
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
you didn't ask for.

841
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Michelle, let's talk about the vote

842
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
because we have a love affair

843
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
and we have a war,

844
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
and then we have ten people playing a game they love.

845
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Yeah, I think you're making a good point

846
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
that we're all trying to play a game

847
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
where we're thinking four people

848
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
and we're all trying to play a game

849
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
where we're thinking forward.

850
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I also think Figgy is in the middle

851
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
of a couple things that are not good for the tribe.

852
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
And so, if I were Figgy, I might be scared.

853
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Figgy, when you hear your name come up

854
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
openly with Taylor

855
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
and openly with Michaela,

856
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
are you feeling a little more uncertain?

857
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
A little bit.

858
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
But my mind's at peace right now

859
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
and I feel good.

860
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Zeke, seconds away from voting,

861
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
these three are still talking.

862
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm curious what's going on.

863
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
I'm curious what's going on.

864
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
I think just Hannah being Hannah.

865
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Sure, they're talking

866
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
and, you know, we could be paranoid

867
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
in seeing what's going on,

868
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
but Hannah is just peachy.

869
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,200
And whatever she's talking about right now

870
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
it's probably about puppies

871
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
or butts or something.

872
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
All right.

873
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
It is time to vote.

874
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Will, you're up.

875
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Ah!

876
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Ah!

877
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Ah!

878
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Ah!

879
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Ah!

880
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Ah!

881
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Ah!

882
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Darling, you're much too dangerous

883
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
to stay in the skin.

884
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Ah!

885
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Ah!

886
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Ah!

887
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I'm really, really, really

888
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
up, I can trust Michaela.

889
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Okay.

890
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
If they're getting me to throw my vote

891
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
then I have to prove my trust in them.

892
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
But I don't understand how the vote

893
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
changed this quite clear.

894
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Zeke, Mari, Michaela.

895
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Wait, Mari.

896
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Mari.

897
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Ah!

898
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
But I don't understand what's going on.

899
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Oh, my God.

900
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Oh, my God.

901
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Ah!

902
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
She doesn't vote.

903
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,200
She doesn't vote.

904
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Ah.

905
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Ah.

906
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Okay.

907
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Ah.

908
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Ah!

909
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Ah!

910
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Ah!

911
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Ah!

912
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Ah!

913
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,200
I'll go tell her the votes.

914
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
If anybody has a hidden immunity

915
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
idol and you want to play it, now would be the time

916
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
to do so.

917
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Okay, once the votes are read, the decision

918
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
is final, person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal

919
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,200
council area immediately. I'll read the votes.

920
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
First vote.

921
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Figgy.

922
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Mari.

923
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Figgy.

924
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Mari. Two votes Figgy, two votes Mari.

925
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Figgy. That's three votes Figgy.

926
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Mari. We'll tie it again. Three votes Figgy, three votes Mari.

927
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Mari. That's four votes Mari, three votes Figgy.

928
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Mari. That's five votes Mari, three votes Figgy.

929
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Second person voted out of Millennials versus Gen X. Mari.

930
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:15,200
That's enough. Need to bring me your torch.

931
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Mari. The tribe has spoken.

932
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Time for you to go.

933
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Salty.

934
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Salty.

935
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Well, it's very clear that the enthusiasm on this tribe

936
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,200
is overshadowed only by the level of gameplay.

937
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Gloves are off and it is on.

938
00:41:51,200 --> 00:42:05,200
The torch has set back to camp. Good night.

939
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

940
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Next time on Survivor.

941
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Zeke and Adam feel betrayed.

942
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
I'm upset right now. I'm really upset.

943
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
No, no, look, look, look.

944
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
My first hashtag blindside.

945
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
But a twist in the game shakes things up.

946
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
It has to be a random draw.

947
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,200
I want to be a part of this twist. I want to experience what Gen X has to offer.

948
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
One, two, three.

949
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,200
I got sniped from a mile away and I never saw it coming.

950
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Survivor is the toughest game I've ever played because it pulls on the heartstrings

951
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,200
and playing with human emotion is completely different from playing on a 2D screen.

952
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,200
And it hurts, man. That's all I can say. It hurts.
