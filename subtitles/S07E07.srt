00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,793
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously, on

2
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:04,921
Survivor: Rupert had some
regrets after his first Tribal

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,590
Council.
I can't believe

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,093
I wrote Michelle's name down
instead of Shawn.

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,095
>> PROBST: And he Morgan Tribe
had a visit from a Panamanian

6
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,263
local.
( bird squawks )

7
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:17,308
>> I think it's hilarious
that Osten is scared of every

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,310
little thing.
>> PROBST: At Drake...

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,312
>> Dude, you do more not to do
work than doing work!

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,314
>> PROBST: ...Shawn had worn
out his welcome.

11
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,608
>> SANDRA: Shawn should get a
clue or he's going home.

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,445
>> PROBST: At the reward
challenge: First part of

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,071
today's reward: steak.
ALL: Oh...

14
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,823
>> PROBST: Drake took aim at
Morgan...

15
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,118
Drake wins reward!
( all cheering ) ...and savored

16
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,745
their victory.
>> This is the bomb.

17
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,456
>> PROBST: At the immunity
challenge, the tribes' minds

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,542
and bodies were pushed to the
limit, and Morgan was the

19
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,960
last tribe standing.
Morgan wins immunity.

20
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,255
Facing Tribal
Council, Shawn was on the

21
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,175
chopping block until Trish
and Jon felt threatened by

22
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,260
Rupert.
>> TRISH: One person has

23
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,012
a hell of a lot of power
right now.

24
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,181
>> JON: There's no way
anyone can go against Rupert

25
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,266
to the final two.
It'd be a freakin' K.O., man.

26
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,102
They're planning on getting
rid of you tonight.

27
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,979
>> PROBST: But Rupert turned the
tables with a plan of his own by

28
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:06,483
going to Shawn for support.
>> I'm with you on that, baby.

29
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,277
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Trish and Jon's plan was

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,654
foiled when Shawn sided with
Rupert.

31
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,866
Sixth person voted out
of the Pearl Island: Trish.

32
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,663
The tribes are now even at
five members each.

33
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,792
Who will be voted out tonight?

for me?

00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,496
Who the hell voted for me?
Jon?

39
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,916
>> Yeah.
>> Who the hell voted for me?

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,585
>> I did.
>> What the ... was that ...

41
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,588
tonight?
>> I was down for Drake, dude,

42
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,048
I would have made a decision...
>> Damn it, look at me!

43
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,092
>> I'm looking at you.
>> What the ... was that ...

44
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,219
>> I made a decision
based on... You're starting

45
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,722
>> You're starting this ... now!
Damn it.

46
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,767
At Tribal Council,
I dodged the biggest

47
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,271
cannonball aimed right at me.
I knew when I saw two

48
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:12,817
"Ruperts" in the vote,
that Trish and Jon were

49
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,528
against me.
I was ready to

50
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,115
kill Jon, literally grab that
little scrawny ass by the neck

51
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,118
and pop his head off him like
a ... chicken.

52
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,954
I'm out there kicking my ass
to get you ... damn fish

53
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,540
and you ... turn the tribe
against me!

54
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,500
>> I didn't turn
the ... tribe against you.

55
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,169
>> Who did?
>> Hey, it wasn't my...

56
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,630
>> Who did?
>> The... the person that's gone

57
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,673
right now is the person that
came up with the idea.

58
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,634
>> Who voted for me?
>> I did.

59
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,930
>> I ... realized it
today that she was lying to me

60
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,099
the whole time-- deceiving the
tribe, telling all kinds of

61
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,435
stories, different versions.
>> She had it in the bag.

62
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,355
She had you guys locked up,
she had Jon locked up.

63
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,690
>> CHRISTA: And Jon's trying to
pass it off right now, like,

64
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,317
"Oh, I wasn't part of the
whole plan." Listen.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,320
>> JON: I want to know why
I wasn't included in the

66
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,655
conversation.
>> Included?

67
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,658
In ... me?
You ... me!

68
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,202
You were included.
>> I didn't...

69
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,329
Hey, I made the decision based
on Drake.

70
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,457
>> Drake made the decision.
You were the odd man out.

71
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,669
>> JON: I've never seen a
guy more mad in my entire

72
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,170
life.
I mean, he's right in

73
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,630
my face.
He's ready to punch me.

74
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,382
But if there were to be a
merge, Rupert's absolutely a

75
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,008
threat.
I mean, he could

76
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,511
switch on a dime.
He says he'd never do it,

77
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,347
but it pissed me off when
he... when he helped Morgan win

78
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,683
that challenge, and, uh, I...
I'm not the kind of guy that

79
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,560
forgives or forgets
You said in your own words,

80
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,982
"If any one of us went over to
Morgan, that they would vote

81
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,318
them off. "However, you did say
if there was one person that

82
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,529
could go over there, they
wouldn't do that to, it would

83
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,281
be you.
>> I never said that in

84
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,741
a ... million years.
>> Well, I was under the

85
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,828
impression that you did.
>> Who the hell would even have

86
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,870
the ... arrogance
to say that?

87
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,206
>> I... I thought that was a
ballsy ass statement.

88
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,000
>> Why... if
I thought that, why wouldn't I

89
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,668
have stayed there and made the
Morgans stronger?

90
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,212
>> Well, I... I don't know.
Well, I have no clue.

91
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,131
That, that makes... that makes
a lot of sense.

92
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,841
>> I would have
stayed there and said, "You

93
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:00,883
Drakes are dead."
>> And I was

94
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,719
scared to death that you were
going to turn on us.

95
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,387
>> I am the
one person that will always

96
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,848
stand true to Drake.
>> I was following some...

97
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,018
>> You were following Trish, who
was telling every one of us

98
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,894
you and me are going to be the
final two.

99
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,230
She was telling
every one of us that.

100
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,690
Let's start fresh.
>> All right.

101
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,277
It sucks, man. I'm sorry.
>> We're all done,

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,654
and we'll be five strong
Drakes, okay?

103
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,531
>> All right.
>> We're to be five strong

104
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,615
Drake.
>> Yep.

105
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,827
>> RUPERT: I'm not saying Jon is
finished yet, but...

106
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,374
( sighs )
I'm not saying that I believe

107
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,918
him at all anymore.
I don't

108
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,254
believe a damn word he says.
>> I'm sorry, man.

109
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:42,050
I don't know why I believed
that, I just did.

110
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,718
>> Jonny Fairplay
is Jonny Pain-In-The-Ass now

111
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:54,270
to me.
(thunder)

112
00:05:54,353 --> 00:06:04,363
(wind whistling)
>> Bull ... rain, go away.

113
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:18,586
(wind whistling)
>> Bull ... rain, go away.

114
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,715
I can't even get out in the
ocean; I get pounded around,

115
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,594
try to get a fish.
>> ANDREW: Day 19.

116
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,638
A little worn out.
I think there's a direct

117
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,974
correlation between lack of
protein in our bodies and

118
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,269
energy, and then Rupert came
over for a couple of days.

119
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,689
We had some fish, dramatic
increase in energy-- I felt

120
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,650
like a new person.
Right now,

121
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,611
we'd probably give anything
to have Rupert over here.

122
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,947
In fact, we definitely would
give anything to have Rupert

123
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,031
over here.
>> Dude, there's a stingray

124
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,284
right there. Dude, dude, dude!
Whoa, he's right there.

125
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,536
You see him?
He's right there.

126
00:06:51,619 --> 00:07:01,629
Yes!
>> He's long gone now, pal.

127
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:07,343
Yes!
>> He's long gone now, pal.

128
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,724
>> It's not that we don't want
the fish, it's that we're

129
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,143
having great difficulty
catching them.

130
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,396
This is the most
I've ever eat beans in my

131
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,897
whole life.
>> You can only eat

132
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,191
so many beans.
>> RYNO: Why's that?

133
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,610
>> 'Cause they suck.
( Tijuana laughs )

134
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,654
>> TIJUANA: We
only have two portions of rice

135
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,698
left.
>> OSTEN: It's imperative

136
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,825
that we merge.
It's imperative.

137
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,871
'Cause, I'm...
I'm bigger than everybody else.

138
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,874
I'm, like, 200 pounds.
I'm probably like 175 right now.

139
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,710
I have no energy to do
anything, and, uh...

140
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:46,048
it's wearing on me.
>> ANDREW: It's so difficult

141
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,886
because we know if we had as
much fish as the Drake Tribe

142
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,221
has, we'd be having parties
every night, dancing and

143
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,265
singing.
I can't imagine

144
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,851
having my own fish.
It just...

145
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,897
it's depressing to think
about, actually; I'd rather

146
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,025
not think about it.
>> RYNO: Think if, uh, Skinny

147
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,904
Ryan were still... still here.
>> He would have perished.

148
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,614
>> ( laughing ): He would
perish.

149
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,074
>> Yeah.
>> So would Lill.

150
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,951
>> TIJUANA: Yeah, I think so,
too.

151
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,287
>> ANDREW: You know, it gets
mentally overwhelming

152
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,041
and draining to think about
all the things we need to do

153
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,710
just to survive out here, and
it's exhausting.

154
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,424
>> I'm tired today.
>> My entire body aches.

155
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:33,429
>> And you can see on my tribe
mates, it's taking their toll.

156
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:36,557
O. T., this morning,
he has good days and he has

157
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,975
bad days; this morning he
checked out-- I could see it

158
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,936
in his eyes, I could read it
a mile away.

159
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,855
He's... he's somewhere.
He's not here.

160
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,318
He didn't sleep at all last
night from what I could see

161
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,904
'cause he kept me up, but
he'll rally if we need him

162
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:59,956
for something... hopefully.
>> SHAWN: I'm curious to see

163
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,044
for something... hopefully.
>> SHAWN: I'm curious to see

164
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,839
what's going on today.
I've got a hunch, baby.

165
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,467
I got more than a hunch.
I know this is the biggest sea

166
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,262
mail we'll ever see.
>> RUPERT: My tribe, they have

167
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,598
it in their heads that we're
going to a new island

168
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,643
and having a big party
and going to go with Morgans

169
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,813
and be in a merge.
>> All right, guys, here we go.

170
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:28,317
>> If it happens, okay, but I'm
not looking forward to it,

171
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,695
because I have a strong
tribe right now, I do not

172
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,323
want to merge yet, and I
cannot plan on a merge yet.

173
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,494
>> All right, here we go. You
ready? This could decide the

174
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:43,124
future. Whoa, wait a second
here. We got a lock and keys.

175
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,834
>> SANDRA: One more challenge.
I'd take a challenge in a

176
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,128
minute.
>> "The most important

177
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,880
reward for which your tribe
"will compete needs you to

178
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,175
work together "and be quick on
your feet. "It's better than

179
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,928
steak and lobster, "will be
the sweetest victory you'll

180
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,390
know, but if the other tribe
gets it, it would seem a

181
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,516
painful blow."
>> I think we're

182
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,685
going to be locked together
and we have to get certain

183
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,936
keys to unlock us.
"It will be

184
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,354
the sweetest victory you'll
know."

185
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,356
>> Well, we shall soon find
out, huh?

186
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,983
>> Make some popcorn
before we go?

187
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,693
>> I would love to
try some of that.

188
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,488
>> SANDRA: On
our way back from, uh, the

189
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,157
tree mail, Jon mentioned,
"Hey, you know what? We

190
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,743
should open up a coconut."
And, uh, Rupert, Christa,

191
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,620
myself and Jon had said,
"Okay, we want the coconut

192
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,706
popcorn." Because once you fry
the coconut, it tastes exactly

193
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,916
like popcorn.
>> SHAWN: I don't

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,586
even... you know what, to be
honest, we're not cooking it.

195
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,046
'Cause, we don't really have
time.

196
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,047
Yeah, we'll cook the
next one.

197
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,132
>> We don't have the
other one. Let's just do it.

198
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,216
That's not...
>> I'll share this

199
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,385
one with them, and then you
can cook that one, Jon.

200
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,887
>> They would want it cooked.
Jon, stop arguing. They've

201
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,764
already said. Everyone said.
>> You argue about everything.

202
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,807
>> Does Rupert want it cooked?
>> Do we have time to sit

203
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,893
here and worry about this ...
right now?

204
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,895
>> We wor... We're doing it.
You're the only one

205
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,314
working against that.
>> Do it.

206
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,567
>> Well, you can help, and that
would speed up the process.

207
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,527
>> I don't want to help...
>> I know you don't, because

208
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,738
that's not your decision.
>> Are you going to make this

209
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,031
a ...
difficult thing every ... day,

210
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,449
already? Come on, now.
>> JON: Yes! Obviously!

211
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,368
>> It's always an argument with
you.

212
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,370
>> Four out of five people
said...

213
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,913
>> You're about to cry again
over a... over a...

214
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,997
>> You're an ass ..., dude.
>> Excuse me?

215
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,708
>> You're an ass ...
>> You want to sit here and call

216
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,918
me an ass ...
We're gonna go

217
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,712
take care of this, 'cause you
are not sitting and calling me

218
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,756
an ass ... anymore, all right?
You're a ... all right?

219
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,257
Enough, all right?
>> Dude, get out of my face.

220
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,884
>> No. Don't even
tell me to get out of your

221
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,594
face.
>> SANDRA: Cut it out.

222
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,554
>> SHAWN: You know what your
problem is, Jon?

223
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,931
You're a little baby.
>> JON: I'm not hiding....

224
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,891
>> Be a man.
>> A man doesn't fight

225
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,434
someone, you ... !
A ... Neanderthal does.

226
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,685
There's a ... difference.
>> We have about 20 minutes.

227
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,771
>> Exactly, we have enough time
to ... make popcorn, you ...

228
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,233
>> Call me a ...
again, Jon, I swear to God...

229
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,151
>> You threaten me with physical
violence one more ... time,

230
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,113
man... Threat... I want you to,
dude! 'Cause I want to see

231
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,614
you ... walk away!
>> Don't cry like a ... baby if

232
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,533
you're...
>> SANDRA: They're

233
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,494
always fighting. I'm glad
it's not me. Let them duke

234
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,621
it out. You know, let them
kill each other, vote each

235
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,707
other off. As long as it ain't
Sandra, I'm happy.

236
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:07,852
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!
19 days you've been out here

237
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,812
in the Pearl Islands.
You have

238
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,649
survived the bugs, the lack of
food, miserable living

239
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,485
conditions, and the
ever-shifting tribal dynamics.

240
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:21,449
Together, you voted six people
out of this game, three from

241
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,410
Morgan, three from Drake.
The reasons you voted these

242
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,536
people out varied.
The only

243
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:29,331
real common trait among the
six people you voted out is

244
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,877
that they're no longer in this
game-- but that may soon

245
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,628
change.
Morgan, Drake, your

246
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,340
past has come back to haunt
you.

247
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:45,431
Come on in, guys.
>> OSTEN: No way.

248
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:51,687
>> SANDRA: What's that?
>> PROBST: The six people you

249
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:58,027
have voted outs
return now as a third tribe.

250
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:05,659
Nicole, Skinny Ryan, Lill,
Burton, Michelle and Trish.

251
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,831
Do you guys have a tribe name?
>> We're the Outcasts.

252
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,210
>> PROBST: The Outcasts.
Not unlike the

253
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,338
pirate days, they got tired of
somebody, felt they were no

254
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,050
longer worthy, they shipped
them out to sea and left them

255
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,051
for dead.
Typically, they died,

256
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,055
but every so often, they
didn't, and when they came

257
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,016
back, they usually had one
thing on their mind.

258
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,726
I'm guessing it's the same with
you. Michelle?

259
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:35,022
>> Revenge, baby.
All about revenge.

260
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,215
>> PROBST: All right, guys.
Let's get to it.

261
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,093
Here's how it will work-- the
Outcasts will compete against

262
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,555
Morgan and Drake in a
three-tribe challenge, and the

263
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,391
stakes are severe.
If Morgan

264
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,895
or Drake lose to the Outcast
tribe, you will go to Tribal

265
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,438
Council tonight and you will
vote somebody out.

266
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,149
The Outcasts will then go to
Tribal Council and vote

267
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,611
somebody in and replace the
member you lost.

268
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,365
If both tribes
lose to the Outcasts, you both

269
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,326
will go to Tribal-- separately.
Both will vote somebody out,

270
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,121
and two Outcasts will come
back into this game.

271
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,082
In addition, if any Outcast
makes it back into this game,

272
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,668
they are immune at the next
Tribal Council to give them

273
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,796
a fair shot at integrating
with their new tribe and

274
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,465
getting back into this game.
If the Outcasts kick your ass,

275
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,262
you may be going home.
On the flip side, if you really

276
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,763
are the ten most worthy
survivors,

277
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,141
this should be no trouble.
Drake, Morgan, just so you

278
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,311
know, the Outcasts have been
living on very limited rations

279
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,272
of rice and fruit and protein,
just like you.

280
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,025
Okay. Want to
know what the challenge is?

281
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,151
ALL: Yeah.
>> PROBST: It's a first.

282
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,321
It is a three-tribe challenge.
It's a series of rescues.

283
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,782
There are three prisons with
three cages in each one.

284
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,452
Your entire tribe will be
locked up, except for one

285
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,495
tribe rescuer.
On my "go,"

286
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,125
rescuers will race to the beach
to retrieve their flag. Each

287
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,669
flag is an equal distance
from the tribe prison.

288
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,381
Using your hands, start digging
under and into the first cage

289
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,009
where you will release your
first tribe mate, who's tied

290
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,137
up. Together, you will dig
into the second cage and

291
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,474
release two more tribe mates
who are also tied up.

292
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,684
On the ground, you'll find
scattered sticks and string.

293
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,021
Use those to build a pole
and reach for two keys in

294
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,191
the third cage, which will
unlock that door. Those keys

295
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,193
will also unlock the rest of
your tribe. Now, everybody's

296
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,029
in the last cage and you
need to get out of that

297
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,824
final door. Use your pole
again to retrieve one last

298
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,370
key from outside the prison.
First tribe, with their flag,

299
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,041
to cross the finish line wins.
For the Outcasts, you're

300
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,876
fighting to get back in this
game.

301
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,419
Drake and Morgan, you're
fighting to stay alive.

302
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:08,384
All right. Select your tribe
rescuers. Wait for my "go."

303
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,846
All right, the rescuers you
chose for your tribes: Burton

304
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,100
for the Outcasts, Andrew for
Morgan, Shawn for Drake.

305
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:24,358
A lot at stake.
Survivors ready?

306
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,860
Go!
( cheering )

307
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,697
Go!
Burton out to an early lead.

308
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:37,037
Savage behind.
Shawn bringing up the rear.

309
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:41,083
Burton has his flag and he's
heading back. Shawn has his

310
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,420
flag. Savage has his flag.
( teams shouting

311
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,213
encouragement )
Burton is

312
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:51,135
first back, puts his flag in
and starts digging.

313
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,429
Shawn digging,
Savage right there.

314
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,474
>> Dig, Burton!
Go! Dig!

315
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,935
You're almost there!
>> PROBST: Burton trying to get

316
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,563
under.
>> Shove yourself!

317
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,564
>> PROBST: Burton,
for the Outcasts,

318
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,400
first through the cage.
Starting to untie Trish.

319
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:10,112
Shawn is through for Drake.
>> Come on.

320
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,281
Forget the flag!
>> Here, get the other one.

321
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,076
>> PROBST: Keep it going,
Savage. He's got it.

322
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,746
Going to get through.
Good job!

326
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:32,009

their tail.

330
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,186
>> Come on, guys!
>> PROBST: All three tribes,

331
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,313
guys, are in the first cage.
It's anybody's game.

332
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:49,359
Ryno untied for Morgan.
Christa through to

333
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,988

for the Outcasts.
>> Get her! Get her! Get her!

335
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,035
>> That's okay. Come here. Come
here, Chris. Come here!

336
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,621
>> PROBST: Shawn through.
Both Drake members now on the

337
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,165
second cage.
Drake with a

338
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,795
slight lead over the Outcasts.
Morgan still struggling.

339
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,631
Burton's under.
Now, both Outcasts are through

340
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,218
to the second cage.
Andrew Savage squeezing under.

341
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,137
Morgan, you're still in last
place. Pick it up, guys.

342
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,516
Burton starting to work on
Michelle.

343
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,727
Rupert'suntied.
He goes to work on a pole.

344
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:28,148
A lot of challenge left.
Keep fighting.

345
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,360
Ryno's through.
All three tribes now in the

346
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,528
second cage.
Drake and the

347
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,323
Outcasts have everybody free.
Morgan still trying to untie

348
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,242
tribe members.
>> Give me another one.

349
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,202
Give me another one.
>> PROBST: T's almost free.

350
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,746
It's now a race.
You got to build a pole

351
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,374
to get those keys that'll get
you in the third cage.

352
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,709
Drake working together.
Outcasts taking their time,

353
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:54,049
building a long, strong pole.
Osten's free.

354
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:57,886
Everybody now free for Morgan.
All three tribes are now working

355
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,388
on their pole.
You got to get those first keys.

356
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:06,061
>> Go.
>> We're fine here.

357
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,063
We're fine here. here.
>> Good.

358
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,690
>> We're fine here.
>> Hold on. Hold on.

359
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,234
>> Hold on.
>> PROBST: Rupert has the first

360
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:19,616
set of keys for Drake.
Burton going for the first set

361
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,705
of keys for the Outcasts.
Drake, first tribe into that

362
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:29,251
last cage.
>> Hold on.

363
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,629
>> There you go. Easy, easy,
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

364
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,048
>> All right.
>> Grab it. Grab it.

365
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,593
>> PROBST: The Outcasts now have
their keys, about to get into

366
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,053
that last cage.
Drake working it,

367
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,681
going for that final key.
This'll get them out

368
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,224
all together.
Morgan with the pole,

369
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,102
but they're still back
working on their first keys.

370
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,605
The Outcasts are into the
final cage.

371
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,400
It's Outcasts and Drake
neck and neck.

372
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:57,279
Osten... working it.
Morgan still struggling.

373
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,282
Pole about to break.
>> Double. Double lock.

374
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,326
>> PROBST: Drake's pole's
falling apart.

375
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:07,289
>> Go! Go! Go!
>> PROBST: Outcasts going for

376
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,292
that final key,
if the pole holds strong.

377
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,462
Morgan into the last cage.
It's now a race-- who can get

378
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,131
that key first?!
Outcasts very close

379
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:19,509
to a major upset.
Somebody could be coming back

380
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:27,517
into this game.
Don't want to drop those keys.

381
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,270
That pole is starting to bend.
>> Easy!

382
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,481
>> Shh! Shh! Shh!
>> Here we are. We got it.

383
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,316
>> Oh!
>> PROBST: The Outcasts dropped

384
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:39,488
their keys.
>> Come on. Hold on.

385
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,198
>> No, no, no, Lill, you gotta
stay in.

386
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,326
>> Hold on.
>> It's okay.

387
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,164
>> PROBST: Morgan and Drake
fighting to stay alive.

388
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,959
>> Come on.
>> Be careful. Be careful!

389
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,127
Be careful!
>> PROBST: Morgan's pole has

390
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,632
just fallen apart.
Outcasts have their keys,

391
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,426
unlocking the last lock.
This could be it.

392
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,388
Drake trying to catch up.
The Outcasts working together

393
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,598
as a tribe, untying the door.
>> BURTON: Go!

394
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:11,520
>> Get it! Come on!
>> PROBST: Everybody's got to

395
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,480
cross the finish line,
got to have the tribe flag.

396
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,190
( yelling and cheering )
Michelle's through,

397
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,526
Burton's through.
Ryan is through!

398
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,696
The Outcasts defeat Morgan and
Drake!

399
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:34,710
This challenge is over.
It's over.

400
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:40,257
It's over.
(cheering, accolades continue)

401
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:51,226
Huge effort by all three tribes.
I know there's a lot going on

402
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,395
emotionally, but for the
Outcasts, clearly a big win,

403
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:58,191
terrific opportunity.
But let's face it,

404
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,903
you guys have had your own
ups and downs in this game.

405
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,739
Burton, how big a victory is
this?

406
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:08,368
>> Revenge is sweet, but...
it's been no walk in the park,

407
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,121
and you want to talk about
being down, man, got kicked

408
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,248
out of a tribe.
Those are the lowest of the

409
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:14,583
lows.
They haven't been there yet.

410
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,960
So, uh, we faced a lot of
adversity and came back

411
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,129
stronger than ever.
>> PROBST: Okay, here's how

412
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,132
it's gonna work:
Drake... you will come to

413
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,551
Tribal Council first tonight,
you'll vote somebody out.

414
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,428
They will be going home.
Morgan...

415
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,973
you will follow them in a
separate Tribal Council.

416
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,143
You will vote somebody out.
They'll be going home.

417
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,064
The Outcasts... you'll come in
last, you'll vote two people

418
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,150
into the game, and they'll
report to their new tribes

419
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,277
immediately.
Make sense?

420
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,530
Head back the way you came.
See you at Tribal Council.

421
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,819
>> ANDREW: The game to end all
games.

422
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,821
It's frustrating,
it's exhilarating, it's

423
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,616
exciting, and it's a pain in
the ass.

424
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,994
Those six in the...
the misfits... have no right

425
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,995
to be here.
>> None. None.

426
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,123
All right? So I want
everyone's word, looking me in

427
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,582
the eye.
Whoever they send

428
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,001
over here is gone the very next
opportunity.

429
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,711
We got that?
>> RYNO: They got immunity on

430
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,923
the first one. The first one.
>> You're kidding.

431
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:49,052
>> It doesn't matter though.
It'll be three on two.

432
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,388
Bye-bye.
>> ANDREW: Well, we need to

433
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,849
strategize.
I don't want any

434
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:59,020
of those misfits getting any
control or authority in our

435
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,689
tribe.
>> No. No way. I don't...

436
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,816
>> I don't care about Drake.
Anybody that left Morgan,

437
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,985
there's a damn good
reason for it.

438
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,571
Skinny Ryan has no business
stepping on this beach again.

439
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,365
Lill-- God bless her-- I love
her... she's got no business

440
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,201
competing in those challenges.
>> TIJUANA: For the most part,

441
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,662
we're all frustrated about
the new dynamic to this game.

442
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,540
And it was very obvious
that Andrew did not want

443
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,251
this new tribe member to
really have a say.

444
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,961
I think that
Andrew's very comfortable

445
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,547
being the leader.
He's got the

446
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,049
best seat in the house, um...
and I think he wants to keep

447
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,634
that.
>> Worst-case scenario,

448
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,721
we'll vote somebody out
tomorrow, and it can't be the

449
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,181
( bleep ) who joined us.
( groans )

450
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,184
>> I'd be the first one voted
off.

451
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,561
Vote me right off, 'cause I
don't deserve to win. Okay?

452
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,064
You guys stuck it out.
Your body could last longer than

453
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,692
mine. Mine couldn't.
I'm out of gas. I'm spent.

454
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,402
I couldn't even move in that
challenge today.

455
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,863
My temple has
got nothing to offer for me.

456
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,908
I'm... I'm a bag of atrophy
right now.

457
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,619
Anybody knows me
knows, when I come to play

458
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,915
at anything, it's 110%.
And, if I can't give that, I'm

459
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,125
out.
I like to win straight

460
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,211
up, and I can't do that.
Number two, I don't really

461
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,545
give a damn what someone else
thinks about me.

462
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,047
If you don't
like what I do or what I say or

463
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,799
what I've done, you can get in
line to kiss my ass.

464
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,053
For me to stay any longer
just makes me look like a fool.

465
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,263
And you can cut your losses.
You know, you're not going to

466
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,932
win everything.
>> You're sure?

467
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,809
I'm positive. Vote me off.
It's been a pleasure.

468
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,395
It's been a pleasure with all
you guys.

469
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,689
I just don't have it
in the tank anymore.

470
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,775
I don't have it in the tank
anymore.

471
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,277
>> TIJUANA: I'm not going to say
anything to Osten to make him

472
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,238
stay.
He had already

473
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,115
initially thought about
quitting quite a while ago.

474
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,159
I had something to say then
because I thought he had

475
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,328
more in him.
This time around, I don't... I

476
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,330
don't have anything to say to
Osten.

477
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,332
>> I can't sleep.
Every bone in my body is so

478
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,334
sore.
It's... it's unbearable, so...

479
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:48,129
You guys been good.
>> ANDREW: I think that O.T.

480
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,756
mentally and physically has
shut down.

481
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,260
He wants out, but
I feel, given any state of

482
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,930
facts, the last thing in the
world I would do is quit.

483
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,932
>> That's something he'll have
to live with for the rest of his

484
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,142
life.
>> And I don't think that

485
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,144
he's going to fully appreciate
it until it... it's obviously

486
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:13,196
too late.
>> SANDRA: That was terrible.

487
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:20,829
too late.
>> SANDRA: That was terrible.

488
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,332
Horrible, horrible, horrible.
Who would have thought

489
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,836
they'd come back to haunt us?
When I first saw the

490
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,672
Outcast tribe, I was, like,
no way!

491
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,175
And then to see
Burton as their leader-- he's

492
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,511
so strong-- and everyone, I
know, was probably full of

493
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:39,681
anger and energy.
Who, do you think, is going to

494
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,182
come back?
>> Burton and Lill.

495
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,810
If those are the two...
You can't assume that, though.

496
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,687
Burton is not going to go down
without a fight.

497
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,355
>> I think it'll
be Michelle and Lill.

498
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,816
>> You wonder why those guys
were so happy about winning,

499
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,110
it's because they're a bunch
of losers that got a second

500
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,655
chance in life.
If you're a winner, you don't

501
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,157
have to go through the second
chance, uh, game.

502
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,701
So, you know, they're used to
that-- their entire lives,

503
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,661
they've been losers.
This is no different.

504
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,539
Well, somebody
has to go home.

505
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,541
Who wants to volunteer?
Raise your hand right now.

506
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:11,880
>> Anybody?
Hey, don't everybody jump up

507
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,591
at the same time.
Did anybody raise their hand?

508
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,343
>> No.
>> RUPERT: I don't feel

509
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,720
vulnerable tonight.
I have my three.

510
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:23,391
I'm not vulnerable tonight.
The two other guys

511
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,728
in the tribe are vulnerable.
Jon wrote my name down last

512
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,689
night, and fair is fair.
I should write Jon's name down

513
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,733
tonight, but I haven't
decided yet.

514
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,944
>> I mean, both of
them I would love to see...

515
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,530
>> RUPERT: Gone. Both of them
are lying their asses off to

516
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,115
us.
>> SANDRA: What if you asked

517
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,285
them to give their reasons why
they feel right now that they

518
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,287
should stay, and see what they
say?

519
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,039
>> They'd both say, "Because
he's a bigger liar.

520
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,707
Because he's telling you this,
he's telling you that."

521
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,751
>> But ask them.
Say, "We can't decide

522
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,379
on which one of you two will
go home, and we want to hear

523
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,589
why you should stay."
And let them fight it amongst

524
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,592
themselves.
>> That would be hilarious.

525
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,929
>> You want to?
You want to?

526
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,724
RUPERT: Hey, Jon.
I have been talking with the

527
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,061
ladies, and I can't decide who
I'm voting for.

528
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,480
I want both of you, if you
would, this is your chance to

529
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,941
sit down and just say why we
should keep you.

530
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,110
>> SANDRA: No fighting.
Two minutes, 'cause we're

531
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,321
leaving in five.
>> The way feel it is, you know,

532
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,450
I feel I've been pretty honest
as much as I could be up to

533
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,078
this point, but, um, Jon, you
know, I feel like I can't trust

534
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,830
him.
With the vote for you

535
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,749
yesterday, with the fact that
if we were to go into a merge

536
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,960
today and Jon didn't feel that
we were all with him, you

537
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,129
know, that that could be
dangerous for us.

538
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,339
>> Jon thought
he had it all in the bag.

539
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,633
He thought he was playing us
all and he had this whole game

540
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,176
figured out.
>> SHAWN: But I'm

541
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,512
going to do everything in my
power to make sure it's game

542
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,638
over for him.
You know, you

543
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,974
can't mess with me long
before I come back and get you.

544
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,935
>> I feel that, uh, I've...
I've shown that I'm loyal to

545
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,814
Drake.
Um, and I also feel that

546
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,151
I'm definitely a much harder
worker, so... and I think

547
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,611
that's important when it comes
to, uh, to everyday living.

548
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,531
>> JON: I know it's between
myself and Shawn.

549
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,533
I'm sure Rupert's not happy
that I wrote his name on a

550
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,535
piece of paper last night.
But, uh, will he forgive and

551
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,580
forget?
I don't know. We'll see.

552
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,143
>> PROBST: Well, I think the
walk in says it all.

553
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,978
I've never seen
you guys this quiet,

554
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:36,524
this separated.
I know you didn't expect to be

555
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,652
here again this soon.
Rupert, you're already shaking

556
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,364
your head.
>> Two days in a row.

557
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,701
Two days in a row.
Never would I

558
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:50,079
have thought we'd be here two
days in a row.

559
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,707
>> PROBST: Christa, what
was your reaction at the

560
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,336
challenge?
>> Oh, it was a little shocking.

561
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,796
I... I wasn't quite
expecting, uh, everybody else

562
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,049
to show back up.
I'm happy

563
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,218
that I really haven't
bad-mouthed anybody from our

564
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,430
own tribe that's over there.
>> PROBST: One of the unique

565
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,225
things about
today's change of events

566
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,228
is, you got to hear from people
who've been voted out.

567
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,689
Burton made a pretty honest
comment about, "You think you're

568
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,691
down?
You don't know down

569
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,569
until you've been voted out."
Sandra, did that hit you at

570
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,155
all as a, "Wow, I never thought
about how these guys have been

571
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,823
feeling"?
>> Definitely.

572
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,619
And with those words, you also
say, "Damn, they're going to

573
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,080
give it their all and they're
going to come back."

574
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:36,251
And now I do feel a little bit
threatened because the way he

575
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,379
sounded, he's ready to come
back today, so I wouldn't be

576
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,590
surprised if he walked back
into camp.

577
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,760
>> PROBST: Burton?
>> Burton.

578
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,930
Burton.
>> PROBST: The guy you couldn't

579
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,432
wait get rid of may be coming
home to roost again.

580
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,103
>> That's right.
>> PROBST: So, what happened

581
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,773
when you went back to camp?
>> Um, when we

582
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:02,402
got back to camp, um,
just before we came out here,

583
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,488
Rupert told the guys, "Okay,
you got two minutes apiece.

584
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,449
Tell us why we should keep you
around." And they said what

585
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,120
they had to say and, um, I
think we won't make our minds

586
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,623
up until we get up there and,
uh, cast our vote, so...

587
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,293
>> PROBST: So, Sandra, is it
safe for me, based

588
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,130
on what I'm hearing, to draw
the conclusion that it is

589
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,923
Shawn or Jon tonight that is
going home?

590
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,552
>> It is Shawn or Jon
that's going home tonight.

591
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,388
>> PROBST: Shawn, why not vote
you out tonight?

592
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,181
What are you going to
bring to this tribe that's

593
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:36,060
crumbling by the moment?
>> I'm dedicated to this tribe,

594
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,981
and I wish we could just wash
the slate from the past and go

595
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,985
forward as strong as we can,
because the only way that this

596
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,655
tribe is going to be powerful
is if we all stick together

597
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,450
and trust each other no matter
what, and I feel that I can be

598
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,202
a good part of that.
>> PROBST: Jon, convince

599
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,330
these guys.
Why not vote you out tonight?

600
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:59,000
>> I feel I care more about
this tribe than I do myself.

601
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,545
Uh, I feel that I know how to
split a coconut five ways as

602
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,006
opposed to Shawn.
I think I have shown

603
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,135
tribe loyalty, which, uh, I
don't know what, uh, Shawn to

604
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:13,014
be loyal to at all.
So, that's pretty much it.

605
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,350
>> PROBST: With that, it is time
to vote.

606
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:25,401
Rupert, you're up.
>> Jon...

607
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:41,209
Rupert, you're up.
>> Jon...

608
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,504
you and I know the truth.
Basically, you've been

609
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,590
backstabbing everyone
including myself.

610
00:32:52,345 --> 00:33:01,729
>> (bleep) you.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

611
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:11,781
votes.
Once the votes are read,

612
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:18,079
votes.
Once the votes are read,

613
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,081
the decision is final.
The person voted out

614
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,083
will be asked to leave the
Tribal Council area immediately.

615
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:33,428
I'll read the votes.
First vote... Shawn.

616
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,601
Jon.
That's one vote Jon,

617
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:46,607
one vote Shawn.
Shawn.

618
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:51,487
That's two votes Shawn, one
vote Jon.

619
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,614
The latest member to
be voted out of the Drake

620
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,617
tribe-- Shawn.
That's three votes, that's

621
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,704
enough. You need to bring me
your torch.

622
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:14,051
Shawn, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

623
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,023
Maybe tonight you
reached your lowest point.

624
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:30,193
If it's any consolation,
Morgan is up next

625
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,945
to vote off one of their own.
And soon, you will both have

626
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,948
new tribe members.
What you do

627
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,786
from this point forward
will define your destiny in

628
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,829
this game.
Grab your torches,

629
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:47,668
head back to camp.
I should have seen this one

630
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,295
coming.
Jon basically went

631
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,715
back on everything he had
told me for the first three

632
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,510
days, um, about our supposed
alliance.

633
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,471
I had hoped that
today would have brought a

634
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,472
merger.
Um, things probably

635
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,016
would have been a lot
different and I might have

636
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,018
been able to go a lot
further. I don't know.

637
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:07,814
What can I say? Game, set,
match.

638
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:23,955
( thunder crashing )
>> PROBST: Well, Drake has been

639
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:42,890
( thunder crashing )
>> PROBST: Well, Drake has been

640
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,518
here and gone.
They were lucky

641
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,562
with the weather.
Unfortunately, you're not.

642
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,231
Been a while since you guys
have been here.

643
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,859
Had a nice run.
Savage,

644
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:57,530
what happened when you guys
got back to camp?

645
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,991
Suddenly you're faced with
an unexpected Tribal Council

646
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,743
and you're going to have to
vote somebody out.

647
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,413
>> As soon as
we get back to camp, Osten

648
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,749
steps forward, says that his
mind and his body have shut

649
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,962
down and that he needs to go.
He can't take it another day,

650
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,923
absolutely insists that we put
his name on the parchment and

651
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,884
vote him out tonight.
>> PROBST: You had

652
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,260
enough, Osten?
>> Uh, going into

653
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,930
this, I was like, "I'll only
go as far as my body will

654
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,057
allow me to go." And right
now, my body's done.

655
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:29,353
Exasperated.
Every bone in my body hurts.

656
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:34,192
I just can't go any further.
I'll be more of a liability

657
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,777
than an asset to my team,and
I refuse to do that.

658
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,779
>> PROBST: Savage,
how much of this experience

659
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,283
is about finding out
what you are made of?

660
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,952
>> It's all about that, Jeff.
It's all mental.

661
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,331
Your mind controls your body.
If your body's shutting down,

662
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,291
it's because, in my opinion,
it's because your mind's

663
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,459
shutting down.
>> PROBST: Okay, so, Osten,

664
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,296
your body, although it appears
to smack anybody's body that's

665
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,799
still left in this game, I
would argue probably your mind

666
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,428
has had enough, as well.
So, when you hear a guy

667
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:07,016
like Burton come back and say
today, "You don't know what

668
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,477
down is until you've been
humiliated by being voted out,"

669
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,981
and yet he still has a burning
desire enough to be back in

670
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,484
this game that he'll risk it
again, is there any part of

671
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,488
you that questions your own
will to go on when your body

672
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,699
may be saying, "I'm tired"?
>> Absolutely not. I equate my

673
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,952
temple to a car.
If it has no gas, it cannot run.

674
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,537
>> PROBST: T,
from what I gathered at that

675
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,332
second Tribal Council, it was
Osten who was the mysterious

676
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,335
person who wanted to quit.
So, this goes back to day five

677
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,963
or six.
What's going on from

678
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,507
your point of view right now
with Osten?

679
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,343
>> Um, I can't dictate
to Osten or understand where

680
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,180
he's coming from.
This experience may not be

681
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:49,850
enough of a sacrifice for him
versus his health.

682
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,520
It is for me.
I'm willing to go until

683
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,022
probably I'm dead here, either
that or I'm voted out, but

684
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,484
that's just me.
>> PROBST: Darrah, I'm

685
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,321
watching your body shrink by
the day, pulling your top up,

686
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,740
nothing's staying on
Do you want out of this game?

687
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,867
>> No, I do not want out of this
game.

688
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,537
Like T said, you know,
I guess you'll have to be

689
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,914
carrying me away because I'm
not going to leave this game

690
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,083
until I have to.
>> PROBST: Ryno, what's

691
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,710
your take on this happening
tonight?

692
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,379
Is it, "You know what?
Fine, Osten. You've wanted to

693
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,257
quit twice. Go home"?
>> As far as I'm concerned, if

694
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,218
it was me, I'd be clawing and
scratching and have to have

695
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:27,263
pneumonia and stuff, but you
know, Osten's going to do his

696
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,556
thing.
That's... that's his

697
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,391
wishes.
I'm going to grant him

698
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,726
his wishes.
>> PROBST: So, I'm going to

699
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,270
go back to you, Osten.
I think you know I'm not

700
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,146
picking on you.
>> Oh, that's

701
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,313
fine if you are.
>> PROBST: So, when you

702
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,942
hear your four other tribe
mates, who obviously adore you,

703
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,779
when you hear them say,
"I wouldn't quit, not for

704
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,908
nothing, Jeff," you can't tell
me somewhere in the back of

705
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,911
your mind, there's not a little
part of you saying, "I am

706
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,871
quitting."
>> It's... take it for

707
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:55,082
whatever you want
I mean, if you want to say

708
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,417
quitting,
you want to say stopping,

709
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,626
yeah, I'm quitting.
My health

710
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,963
to me is more important to me,
um, than the million dollars,

711
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,381
I guess, right now.
Does the

712
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,425
mean justify the ends?
No, it doesn't.

713
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,427
>> PROBST: Let me ask you
something, Osten.

714
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,056
Have you wondered what
the hell you're doing out here?

715
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,932
>> You know what? I'm clearly
out of my element.

716
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,642
As a situation,
I would have thought that,

717
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,896
"Hey, give it a shot."
I can at least say, "Hey, I went

718
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,606
and tried it."
I like to have been

719
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,608
successful.
Apparently, I'm not

720
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,652
going to be, but, you know, I
won't live my life saying,

721
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,404
"What if."
>> PROBST: Savage, you're

722
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,406
shaking your head.
>> If I were to do this,

723
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,326
I would have a
"What if," flat out.

724
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:34,330
What if I went another two days?
What if I went one more day?

725
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,583
I mean, but that's just me.
You know, I... I don't pretend

726
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,752
to-to walk in his shoes, Jeff.
I-I can't understand what

727
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,756
he's going through.
It's his decision.

728
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,343
>> PROBST: Well, Osten,
I don't pretend to know what

729
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,304
you're thinking either, but I
know this-- I've been at about

730
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:54,100
a hundred Tribal Councils, never
ever seen anybody lay down

731
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,311
their torch.
So this is a first for me.

732
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:00,815
Seems unanimous.
I just want to make sure.

733
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,485
Savage, you're going to indulge
Osten, send him home?

734
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,487
>> Yes.
>> PROBST: Darrah?

735
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,239
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Ryno?

736
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,740
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: T?

737
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,451
>> Yes.
>> PROBST: No need to vote and

738
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,496
waste any more time.
Grab your torch.

739
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:28,050
>> PROBST: Osten, per your
wishes...

740
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:38,144
go home.
With all due respect to Osten,

741
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:47,194
go home.
With all due respect to Osten,

742
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,197
people work too damn hard to
get in this game and fight to

743
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,824
stay alive.
If he wants to lay

744
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,744
his torch down, so it shall be.
Who knows?

745
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,081
Maybe this is the best thing
to happen to the Morgan Tribe.

746
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,876
All I know is, you will head
back to camp.

747
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,378
Soon after,
a new tribe member will arrive,

748
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:07,548
and I can promise you this--
that person wants to be in

749
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,217
this game.
Grab your torches,

750
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,220
head on back. Good night.
