00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:04,713
...after the two tribes

5
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:05,422
merged...

00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,464
>> One big, happy family.

7
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,590
>> PROBST: ...James had the only

8
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,467
two hidden immunity idols.

9
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,969
>> James, he's almost guaranteed

10
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:11,594
himself in the top five right

11
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,929
now.

12
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:13,263
>> That's funny.

13
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,223
I'm on<i> Survivor</i> with two idols.

14
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,308
>> PROBST: And the members of

15
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,226
the former Zhan Hu Tribe were on

16
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,270
the chopping block.

17
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,479
>> The plan was to get rid of

18
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,023
Peih-Gee, then Erik and Frosti

19
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,316
after that.

20
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,151
>> PROBST: At the reward

21
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,235
challenge, there was a school-

22
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,695
yard pick where everyone was

23
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,114
chosen to compete except Denise.

24
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,282
>> We're going to go with

25
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,534
Courtney because she's light.

26
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,577
>> PROBST: You will not

27
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,453
participate in this challenge.

28
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,328
You'll not be eligible for the

29
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,371
reward.

30
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,081
Take a spot on the bench.

31
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,374
And back at camp, she was

32
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,584
feeling left out.

33
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,460
>> Are they going to do that

34
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,252
when it comes down to the final

35
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,128
seven?

36
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,254
Am I going to be the one that's

37
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,088
going to go home before JR?

38
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,923
And I going to be the one that

39
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:49,883
goes home before James?

40
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,217
I don't want to be that person.

41
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,093
>> PROBST: And Courtney's

42
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,344
allegiance to the Fei Long

43
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,388
alliance was also wavering.

44
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,306
>> You got to watch Courtney,

45
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,515
because she is a loose cannon.

46
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,058
She does stray off and fall in

47
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,560
love with anybody that floats

48
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,854
and smiles at her.

49
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,480
>> PROBST: So Peih-Gee jumped at

50
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,565
the small opening by trying to

51
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,232
lure Denise and Courtney into

52
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,109
her alliance.

53
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,236
>> There's five of us here.

54
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,279
If we all band together, it'll

55
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,782
be four to five; we can pick

56
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,200
them off one by one.

57
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,284
>> PROBST: At the immunity

58
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,286
challenge, Courtney was the last

59
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,205
one sitting.

60
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,582
Courtney wins immunity!

61
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,083
Facing tribal council, Jean-

62
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,543
Robert discovered that James had

63
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,754
both idols.

64
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,630
>> This is the guy who's favored

65
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,422
to win every challenge from here

66
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,132
out.

67
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,258
>> PROBST: So he came up with a

68
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,593
plan to take out his closest

69
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,011
ally.

70
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:35,845
>> We could blindside him

71
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,429
tonight, because he will not

72
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,348
pull out the idol tonight.

73
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,474
>> PROBST: But Todd turned the

74
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,142
tables on Jean-Robert.

75
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,519
>> I think our best bet is Jean-

76
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,144
Robert.

77
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:43,770
>> Yeah, I don't want... I don't

78
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,896
like breaking the system.

79
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,688
>> You don't want to tell Denise

80
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,314
or no?

81
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,441
>> No, hell no.

82
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,901
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

83
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,528
James took the risk of not using

84
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,654
his idol...

85
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,863
James.

86
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,657
...and almost paid the price.

87
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,199
He received three votes and

88
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,159
Peih-Gee received one.

89
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,246
One vote left.

90
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,289
But in the end, Jean-Robert was

91
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,332
dealt a losing hand.

92
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,668
Jean-Robert, the tribe has

93
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,003
spoken.

94
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:09,879
Eight are left.

95
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:28,815
Who will be voted out tonight?

96
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,149
>> I had a narrow escape last

97
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:30,358
night.

98
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,235
I had three votes.

99
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,403
I mean, now all I have to do is

100
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,904
stay on my Ps and Qs.

101
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,488
But, you know, the odds of me

102
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,240
actually being kicked off with

103
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,200
the two idols are not that hot.

104
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,952
So from now on, I'll have them

105
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:47,375
with me on tribal council.

Camp life without John-Robert is

119
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,276
much nicer, and I think that

120
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,862
everyone else is also kind of

121
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,197
happy to have him gone.

122
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,700
Jean-Robert is such a complainer

123
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,619
and demanding people to fetch

124
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,162

because she was mad.

129
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,562
By blindsiding Jean-Robert, we

130
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,313
had to blindside her too, and it

131
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:55,568
could come back to get us.

132
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,403

former Fei Long, we're going to

134
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,449
vote out the Zhan Hu people.

135
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,368
So last night at tribal council,

136
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,119
I went with the original plan.

137
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:05,703
I voted Peih-Gee, like we were

138
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,121
supposed to.

139
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,873
But I guess at the last moment,

140
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:09,499
everybody changed their minds,

141
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,668
and half the tribe voted for

142
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,170
Jean-Robert.

143
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,171
It kind of makes me feel on the

144
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,422
outside, because I had an

145
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,216
opportunity to switch over to

146
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,426
Zhan Hu, and I decided to stay

147
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,302
with the group that I'm close

148
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,553
to.

149
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,013
And I still get backstabbed.

150
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,889
It's a hard position for me

151
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,932
right now.

00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,643
The thing with last night, I

00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,519
don't know what happened.

155
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,604
Everybody freaked out because...

156
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:35,733
>> But they were supposed to

157
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,484
tell you at the end.

158
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,110

Peih-Gee.

161
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:39,821
At the last second, they should

162
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,530
have told me.

163
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,531

164
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,448
honestly.

167
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,244
Do I feel like I'm the next one

168
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:46,828
to go because I'm an idiot?

169
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,537
>> No, you're still safe.

170
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,789
Just don't... we need to hold

171
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,416

It's smart to stick with him.

>> Oh, my gosh, Jean-Robert was

193
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,843
annoying, and now he's gone, but

194
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,387
all of a sudden Peih-Gee decided

195
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,055
to step in and take his place.

196
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:29,639
>> I'm sorry.

197
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,223
I wasn't trying to micromanage

198
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,517
you.

199
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,986
>> Even though Peih-Gee's not

200
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,613
playing a very smart game, but

201
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,489
the thing is is Courtney, she's

202
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,825
tight with Frosti, and she's

203
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,035
flirting with him.

204
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:51,786
>> I know.

205
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,038
No hot dogs, but pretty close.

206
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:54,789
>> I mean, it's scary.

207
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,498
It really is.

208
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,124
Because you never know if she's

209
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:56,749
going to want to twist or turn,

210
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,668
and that kind of worries me.

211
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,092
>> Tree mail!

212
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,677
And we have a drum.

213
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,553
>> You guys ready?

214
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:08,803
>> Yes.

215
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,555
>> "An experience of a lifetime

216
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,641
in a truly magical place, a

217
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,184
feast of sights to feed your

218
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,894
soul, and you'll also feed your

219
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,229
face.

220
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,188
Again you must divide to

221
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:19,647
conquer.

222
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,191
You better be on the ball.

223
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,819
If you drum up some enthusiasm,

224
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:29,490
you might just win it all."

225
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,742
>> That drum is wicked.

226
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,618
>> I just want to win.

227
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,828
I just hate that, like, I'm the

228
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,454
most losingest survivor left in

229
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:35,872
this game right now.

230
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,582
Like, I've lost the most

231
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,959
challenges out of everybody.

232
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,335
Like, it kind of sucks, and that

233
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,504
makes me want to win even more.

234
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,095
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

235
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,560
You guys ready to get to today's

236
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,603
reward challenge.

237
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,437
>> Yes.

238
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,979
>> Yes, sir.

239
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,355
>> Yeah.

240
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,231
>> PROBST: For today's

241
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,357
challenge, you will be divided

242
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,401
into two teams of four.

243
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,486
Using four different-sized

244
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,031
drums, you must keep a ball in

245
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,866
the air by bouncing it from one

246
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,535
drum to another as you navigate

247
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,662
through a series of obstacles.

248
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,580
Along the way, you'll pass

249
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,582
through two gates.

250
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,709
If you drop the ball, you've got

251
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,668
to return to the start or the

252
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,588
previous gate.

253
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,381
When you reach the end, you must

254
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,675
bounce the ball in a finish bin,

255
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,302
then race back to the start.

256
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:31,928
First team to get three balls in

257
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,555
their bin wins reward.

258
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,307
Want to know what you're playing

259
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,849
for?

260
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,099
>> Yeah.

261
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,517
>> Yes.

262
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,143
>> PROBST: The winning team of

263
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,019
four will be treated to a

264
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,437
spectacular cruise on the Lee

265
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,188
River.

266
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,481
>> Oh, my God!

267
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,315
>> PROBST: One of the most

268
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:44,857
beautiful spots in China.

269
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,943
You'll have a nice dinner, spend

270
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,111
the night on the boat, return to

271
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:49,695
camp in the morning.

272
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,405
Worth playing for?

273
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:51,948
>> Yes.

274
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,823
>> Yeah.

275
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,658
>> PROBST: We're going to

276
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,909
randomly choose captains.

277
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,995
This is a school-yard pick.

278
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,331
Peih-Gee, you're the captain of

279
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,624
the red team.

280
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,250
Erik, you're the captain of the

281
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,168
yellow team.

282
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:04,794
You will rock, paper, scissor to

283
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,421
see who picks first.

284
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,507
>> One, two, three.

285
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,800
>> PROBST: Scissor cuts paper.

286
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,342
Peih-Gee, you get the first

287
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,468
choice.

288
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:12,802
>> James.

289
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,594
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee doesn't even

290
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,265
hesitate.

291
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,350
Peih-Gee selects James.

292
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:19,976
>> PROBST: Erik, your choice.

293
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,020
>> Frosti.

294
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,647
>> PROBST: Erik selects Frosti.

295
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,774
James, your choice.

296
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,235
>> Todd.

297
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,778
>> PROBST: Todd joins James and

298
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,780
Peih-Gee.

299
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,365
Frosti, who you want?

300
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,158
>> I think we'll go with Amanda.

301
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,493
>> PROBST: Amanda coming over to

302
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:41,122
join Erik and Frosti.

303
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:41,914
>> PROBST: Todd you have the

304
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,040
last choice between Courtney and

305
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,792
Denise.

306
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,210
>> Denise.

307
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,712
>> PROBST: Todd takes Denise.

308
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,797
Courtney will join Erik, Frosti,

309
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,591
and Amanda.

310
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,634
We have our two teams.

311
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,261
I'll give you a minute to

312
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:55,886
strategize.

313
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,972
We'll get started.

314
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,935
For a cruise down the Lee River,

315
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,103
a nice meal, and a good night's

316
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:04,812
sleep.

317
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,106
Survivors ready?

318
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,191
Go!

319
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,903
Both groups off to a good,

320
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,864
smooth start.

321
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,866
Todd and Erik taking it all the

322
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,285
way up to the first obstacle.

323
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,202
Going to have to pass sooner or

324
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,247
later.

325
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:27,418
Erik passes to Frosti.

326
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,586
Red team loses it.

327
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,796
You got to go back to the start.

328
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,922
Yellow group's made it through

329
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,299
the first gate.

330
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:33,924
If you drop the ball, that will

331
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,676
be your starting point.

332
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,720
Frosti almost losing it.

333
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,846
Off his head, he does.

334
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,847
Back to this mat here.

335
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,141
There is definitely a learning

336
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,978
curve to this challenge.

337
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,021
James loses it.

338
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,272
Red heads back to the start

339
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,024
again.

340
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,233
Nice pass, Erik keeping it

341
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,402
alive.

342
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,487
They're through the second gate.

343
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,321
>> Okay, guys, don't panic.

344
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,323
Here we go.

345
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,078
>> PROBST: Yellow getting very

346
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,121
close.

347
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,164
>> Erik.

348
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,457
>> PROBST: Frosti back to Erik.

349
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,458
Now they just got to get it in

350
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,043
the finish bin.

351
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:09,919
And they do!

352
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,920
Nice teem teamwork.

353
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,712
Yellow scores one!

354
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,757
You need three to win.

355
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,467
Denise, Peih-Gee, Todd, James,

356
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,551
having a tough time getting the

357
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,762
hang of this.

358
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,722
Whereas Courtney, Erik, Frosti,

359
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,724
and Amanda having much more

360
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,311
success.

361
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:27,937
>> Let me know of any obstacles.

362
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,980
>> Just watch out for the mud,

363
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,273
obstacle.

364
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,149
>> PROBST: Both teams at the

365
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,692
first obstacle.

366
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,986
It's about teamwork.

367
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,279
Todd goes to Peih-Gee.

368
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,031
Peih-Gee keeps it alive.

369
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:39,740
>> You got it, Todd.

370
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,908
>> PROBST: Red doing a good job.

371
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,743
Both teams go through the first

372
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,204
gate.

373
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,332
Frosti passes back to Erik.

374
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,125
>> Toss it to me.

375
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:49,750
>> PROBST: Todd goes to Peih-

376
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,668
Gee.

377
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,168
Peih-Gee keeps it alive.

378
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:51,961
>> Todd, you ready?

379
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,172
Take over.

380
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,426
>> PROBST: Red misses again.

381
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,927
Frosti to Erik, a nice save by

382
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,595
Erik.

383
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,972
Another nice save by Erik.

384
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:08,060
Yellow again very close.

385
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,895
Yellow very close to scoring

386
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,440
their second point.

387
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,900
Yellow leads two-zip!

388
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,778
Red team got to make this one

389
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,114
count.

390
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,241
Peih-Gee keeping it alive.

391
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,326
Todd with a nice save.

392
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,035
>> Get over the line.

393
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,120
Get over the thing.

394
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:26,912
>> PROBST: Red trying to score

395
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,664
their first point.

396
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,750
Todd to Peih-Gee, red very

397
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,419
close.

398
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,670
But they lose it.

399
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,379
>> Grab the ball!

400
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,172
Get back!

401
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,214
Come on!

402
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,591
>> PROBST: Erik leading yellow

403
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,216
up the hill with that third and

404
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,843
final ball.

405
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,927
Red team still on their first,

406
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:47,641
starting to panic.

407
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,809
James, too hard, Peih-Gee can't

408
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,061
get it.

409
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,438
Yellow's making good ground with

410
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,023
that third and final ball.

411
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,860
They've got a good rhythm going.

412
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,492
>> Get it!

413
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,451
Get it!

414
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,619
>> PROBST: Red close, but misses

415
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,579
again.

416
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,205
Red has to go back to the mat.

417
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,582
As yellow heads up the hill with

418
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,417
that third and final ball, they

419
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,504
seem to have figured this out.

420
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,004
Erik to Frosti.

421
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,924
This could be it.

422
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,967
Big reward on the line if they

423
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,385
get it in.

424
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,428
>> Yes!

425
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,304
>> PROBST: And they do!

426
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:25,846
Frosti, Amanda, Erik, and

427
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,056
Courtney cruising down the Lee

428
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,226
River.

429
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,902
Okay, Erik, Frosti, Courtney,

430
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,654
Amanda, you will leave from

431
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,988
here, be taken to the Lee River.

432
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,032
You will return to camp in the

433
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,492
morning.

434
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,953
James, Peih-Gee, Denise, Todd,

435
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,038
your looks say it all.

436
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,081
I got nothing for you.

437
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:52,414
Get your stuff.

438
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,376
Head back to camp.

439
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,752
The reward is waiting.

440
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,336
Head out and have a good time.

441
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,046
>> Thank you.

442
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,692
>> Uh-uh.

443
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,484
I did not see your ass strolling

444
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,193
back to the mat every time we

445
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,445
dropped the ball.

446
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:36,959
>> Uh-huh.

447
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:37,585
I'm the one who was dropping the

448
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,002
ball today?

449
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,546
>> No, I was the only one.

450
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,298
>> I'm not saying it's your

451
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,507
fault, James.

452
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,801
I'm not saying... no... what I'm

453
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,053
saying is... I want...

454
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,180
Can I finish?

455
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,390
Can I please finish?

456
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,266
>> No, you can't, because I

457
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,267
don't care.

458
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,351
Please stop messing with me.

459
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,144
Because every time you bring

460
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,020
something up, I will quickly

461
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,438
blast you back and make you look

462
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:57,980
quite silly.

463
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,607
>> Yeah?

464
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,316
>> Because every time you open

465
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,150
your mouth, you're just speaking

466
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:01,400
nonsense.

467
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,901
That's why you lose.

468
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,777
>> Really?

469
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,403
My ass wasn't strolling back to

470
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,614
the mat after ever time.

471
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,948
I raced back to that damn mat.

472
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,783
You know, I need to take a walk

473
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,412
right now.

474
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,958
>> Peih-Gee, she's just stupid.

475
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,501
I mean, she really came to me

476
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,085
and said that I was the reason

477
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,713
why they didn't... it's all my

478
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,673
fault.

479
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,174
Maybe she's the problem.

480
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,384
She's never won anything.

481
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,094
I mean, maybe that's the sign.

482
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,763
You know, not everybody is

483
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,472
crazy.

484
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,059
You're the crazy one.

485
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,353
>> I'm probably pissed off that

486
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,312
we lost the challenge, and I'm

487
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:38,979
taking it out on James, but I'm

488
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,189
the only person who wasn't won

489
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,024
any reward challenges.

490
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,984
I'm pissed about it.

491
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:44,526
Like, I'd love to go on a

492
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,110
reward, but I don't have a

493
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,112
single ally here.

494
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,197
I don't have anybody.

495
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,198
I'm in, like, a really bad

496
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,241
position.

497
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,701
It's probably not smart to go

498
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,827
around picking fights with

499
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,371
people, but I can't, like, keep

500
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,456
my mouth shut sometimes.

501
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,876
>> Oh, I didn't hear what she

502
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,835
was saying, but I heard her

503
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,628
yelling.

504
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,295
>> She came over to me, saying

505
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,004
it's my fault we lost.

506
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:04,963
>> It's your fault?

507
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,048
>> Yeah, my fault, because I let

508
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,133
the ball drop...

509
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:08,759
>> She dropped the ball a couple

510
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,094
times.

511
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,804
Everybody did.

512
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,638
>> Everybody dropped the ball.

513
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,807
It just wasn't our day.

514
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,561
But that thing... she... ooh.

515
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,146
Is she serious?

516
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,398
Is she serious?

517
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,148
>> I don't like her attitude at

518
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:23,941
all.

519
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:24,608
>> She really came over here and

520
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,442
was blaming me.

521
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,276
That's some nerve.

522
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,652
>> It is nerve.

523
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,111
It's crazy.

524
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,530
>> That's why we need to focus.

525
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,864
We need to keep trying to focus,

526
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,407
and we all need to focus and

527
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,242
just pick them people off.

528
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,201
I'm trying to keep away from

529
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,078
temptation from Zhan Hu.

530
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,871
Them little pretty boys and the

531
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,873
little annoying little girl,

532
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,041
they are still enemies.

533
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:41,542
They're still trying to

534
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,126
infiltrate the force to get

535
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,712
where we already have

536
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,588
predestined ourselves to be.

537
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,424
Amanda is going to be all right.

538
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,717
Courtney, she's flaky, but she's

539
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,427
going to fall in line.

540
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,345
Her... hopefully her and what's

541
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,138
his name don't have a big

542
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,055
romance tonight, which might

543
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,224
happen.

544
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,892
That would hurt.

545
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,518
It makes no sense for us to mess

546
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,228
it up now, but it's so human

547
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,438
nature.

548
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,188
I mean, it's right there in

549
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,356
front of you.

550
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,233
Just don't eat the damn apple.

551
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,235
Be naked and be happy.

552
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,862
Don't eat that damn apple.

553
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,029
I hope that Courtney don't flip.

554
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,156
>> Uh-huh.

555
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:12,740
>> Because Courtney would do

556
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,074
that for love.

557
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,284
>> This is probably the worst

558
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,536
day that I can have out here.

559
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,537
People are freaking out around

560
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,038
camp, and the four people I get

561
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,081
along best with are out having a

562
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,166
good time on a boat somewhere.

563
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,626
Today sucks.

564
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,933
>> All right, everyone, cheers

565
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:40,517
to us.

566
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,393
Cheers!

567
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:41,643
>> Cheers.

568
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,186
>> What great win today.

569
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,145
>> Yeah.

570
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,773
>> What a good win.

571
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,648
I haven't won hardly any

572
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,649
challenges since I've been out

573
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,194
here, so I was amped up to win.

574
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,112
The reward was for this cruise

575
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,574
on the Lee River.

576
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,659
It was spectacular.

577
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,290
I felt like it was a pretty cool

578
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,958
group of people, and you know,

579
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:05,709
of course it was a good

580
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,169
opportunity to just get to know

581
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,837
them a little better and try

582
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,713
and, you know, develop

583
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,591
relationships.

584
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,425
I'm just wondering what it's

585
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,718
like back at camp.

586
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,594
>> I like Peih-Gee.

587
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,720
I just...

588
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,346
>> I wanted to like her.

589
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:17,971
>> She's making me annoyed with

590
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:18,931
her.

591
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:19,723
>> She is cool, like, when she's

592
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,390
relaxing and just kind of

593
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:20,641
hanging.

594
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,725
>> Yeah, but she's...

595
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,309
>> She's totally cool.

596
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:22,935
>> She's too intense right now,

597
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,061
and I don't... I don't like

598
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:24,645
that.

599
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,646
>> She doesn't want to lose, and

600
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,605
I think she feels like she's

601
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,940
powerless, but, like, she's made

602
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,150
a series of poor decisions.

603
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:30,734
>> As much as I'm, like, still

604
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,028
basically on Peih-Gee's side, I

605
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:33,612
don't mind her being talked

606
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,531
about negatively simply because

607
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,157
it means if she's getting talked

608
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,159
about, then I'm not.

609
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,160
>> Here's to us.

610
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:40,369
>> Yeah.

611
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,286
>> Because we're still here.

612
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,329
>> Whoo!

613
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,163
>> Yay!

614
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,957
>> Yay!

615
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,084
>> And on a boat.

616
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,261
>> This is definitely where I

617
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,262
want to be.

618
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,930
>> And the night is young.

619
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,681
>> The night is young.

620
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,515
>> And I'm feeling quite jolly

621
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,307
already.

622
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,475
>> Yay!

623
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,519
Jolly!

624
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,770
I love my Frosti.

625
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,272
I love my Frosti.

626
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,273
I don't really understand my

627
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,691
relationship with Frosti.

628
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,275
He's young.

629
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,693
He's only 20.

630
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,319
And he's kind of cute.

631
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,904
He just wants to play.

632
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,282
I love our reward.

633
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,366
The path of righteousness has

634
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,827
led us in the right direction.

635
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,204
>> I like Courtney a lot.

636
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,249
And I think both of us feel

637
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,209
that, and that's good.

638
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,794
She's a really attractive girl.

639
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,212
She's smart.

640
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,632
She's way out of my league, but

641
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,675
having somebody that you're just

642
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,093
comfortable around is really

643
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,220
nice.

644
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,143
>> Look how high that is

645
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,561
straight up.

646
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,438
>> Oh, my God, unreal.

647
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,355
This is like the greatest

648
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,273
adventure, like, in China

649
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,693
possible.

650
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,569
Oh, my gosh, it's a goat, you

651
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,320
guys!

652
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:56,778
I'm not even kidding.

653
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,030
>> Where?

654
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:58,906
>> That black thing right there.

655
00:19:58,989 --> 00:19:59,406
>> And the white thing.

656
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:03,243
(<i> Erik imitating a goat</i> )

657
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,287
>> That's good.

658
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:05,829
Not only does it sound good.

659
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,581
You do the face.

660
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,208
(<i> Erik imitating a goat</i> )

661
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,543
Erik, stop hitting on the goats.

662
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,086
They're a couple.

663
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,255
(<i> Erik imitating a goat</i> )

664
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:15,839
>> I feel like we had a great

665
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,507
time together.

666
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,300
Maybe it helped me in Courtney

667
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,510
and Amanda's eyes, and maybe

668
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,428
that's enough to at least save

669
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,304
me another round.

670
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:27,142
(<i> Erik imitating a goat</i> )

671
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,560
>> I think that's the greatest

672
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,312
impression I've ever heard.

673
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:30,771
Congratulations, Erik.

674
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,147
>> I do what I can.

675
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,481
I do what I can.

676
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,274
>> I really like Erik.

677
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:34,816
I know he's here to play the

678
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,276
game as well, but I think he's

679
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,819
adorable, and I definitely want

680
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,862
to see him around as long as

681
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,446
possible.

682
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,365
I really like him.

683
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,704
>> Oh, my God!

684
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,247
Is that fried chicken?

685
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,540
Oh, my god!

686
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,917
This is the greatest day of my

687
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,210
life.

688
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,169
What is that?

689
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,046
Mashed potatoes.

690
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:56,463
Thank you!

691
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,298
>> Thank you!

692
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:58,632
>> Oh, my God.

693
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,301
>> Fried chicken!

694
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,637
>> Erik, he is a threat, and

695
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,680
he's been doing a really good

696
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,430
job of getting close to Amanda

697
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,432
and Courtney.

698
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,269
I don't know, it does worry me,

699
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,562
just because... I mean, there's

700
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,897
no reason they couldn't be like,

701
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:14,481
"Oh, well, why don't we just

702
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,900
take Erik instead of Frosti?"

703
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:17,359
It's scary.

704
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,779
I don't want to be replaced.

705
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,339
>> Someone's coming in.

706
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,175
Hey, bitches, welcome home!

707
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,093
>> Hey.

708
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,136
>> We want to hear all about it.

709
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:44,553
>> Juicy details.

710
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,930
>> We had Chinese food, the same

711
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:47,889
thing that we had...

712
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,892
>> Chinese food.

713
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,477
>> Oh, it was so fun.

714
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:52,769
Talk it up.

715
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,438
We need details.

716
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,273
>> We lied to everyone because

717
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,315
if we would have told them we

718
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:57,899
would have had fried chicken,

719
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,525
mashed potatoes, and bread and

720
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,526
butter, everyone would have

721
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,695
hated us for sure.

722
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,904
>> It was a nice cruise though.

723
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,739
>> No, it was really cool.

724
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,531
>> It was nice, and the scenery

725
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,365
was beautiful.

726
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:05,866
>> It was really pretty.

727
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,450
>> It was nice.

728
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,326
>> What's been going on around

729
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:08,952
here, just the same old, trying

730
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,370
to get food and water?

731
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,873
>> Pretty much.

732
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,546
>> Todd, we missed you.

733
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,172
>> It's so nice to have you guys

734
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,256
back, though.

735
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,257
I mean, this is the thing.

736
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,341
Like, you know, believe it or

737
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,551
not, Peih-Gee just lost it and

738
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,636
just started screaming at James.

739
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,179
>> When you guys got back?

740
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,346
>> Yeah.

741
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,723
Screaming at James, like, "You

742
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,434
can't bounce a ball on a drum

743
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,977
and..." da, da, da, da.

744
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,187
She freaked out on him.

745
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,980
>> Oh, my God.

746
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,607
>> He was like, "Bitch, what are

747
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,359
you talking about?"

748
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,069
>> That sounds like a Jean-

749
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:42,944
Robert move.

750
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:43,570
>> Yeah, it is a Jean-Robert

751
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,446
move.

752
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,530
>> Peih-Gee is not necessarily

753
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,115
in most people's good graces

754
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,784
right now, so hopefully I'll be

755
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,202
safe, unless Peih-Gee wins

756
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,453
immunity, and then it's a whole

757
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,747
new story.

758
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,922
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

759
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,473
You guys ready to get to today's

760
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,849
immunity challenge?

761
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,475
>> Yes.

762
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,518
>> Let's do it.

763
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,519
>> PROBST: First thing's first.

764
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,561
Courtney, time to give it up.

765
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,521
>> Oh, and it looked so cute on

766
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,648
her too.

767
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,153
>> PROBST: Once again immunity

768
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,614
is back up for grabs.

769
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,491
Today's immunity challenge will

770
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,036
test your memory.

771
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,454
You will each have a series of

772
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,832
Chinese zodiac symbols in front

773
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,208
of you.

774
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,751
Each round, I will call out a

775
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,921
list of those symbols.

776
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,506
You must then use your knife to

777
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,134
stab them in the correct order.

778
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:47,676
Get it right, you stay in.

779
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,220
Get it wrong, you're out.

780
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,097
Last person left standing wins

781
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,850
immunity, is guaranteed a one-

782
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,644
in-seven shot at winning this

783
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,896
game.

784
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,314
Losers, tribal council tonight,

785
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,691
somebody will be going home.

786
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,317
>> Yeah.

787
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,778
>> PROBST: If you feel so

788
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,530
comfortable you don't think you

789
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,489
need immunity tonight, you can

790
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,658
opt not to play in the challenge

791
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,869
and instead...

792
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,329
>> No.

793
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,164
>> PROBST: ...you can eat.

794
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:17,956
>> Oh, my God!

795
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,665
>> Oh!

796
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,875
>> That's okay.

797
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,667
>> Don't do that.

798
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,252
>> That is so wrong.

799
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,545
>> PROBST: Cheeseburgers.

800
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,338
French fries.

801
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,673
>> Oh, my God!

802
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,632
>> PROBST: Cold drinks.

803
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,427
>> Oh, my God!

804
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,429
>> PROBST: And all the fixings.

805
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,722
>> Oh, my God!

806
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,682
>> That is mean!

807
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,267
>> PROBST: I'm going to give

808
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,893
each of you a white coin and a

809
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,728
black coin.

810
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,688
Black means you want to eat.

811
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,399
White means you want to play.

812
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,400
I'll hand them out.

813
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,943
Don't do anything with them yet.

814
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:47,527
Keep them both together.

815
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,071
Make sure they're separated.

816
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,574
Black means you want to eat.

817
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,658
White means you want to play.

818
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,743
This is a simple case of

819
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,245
temptation.

820
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:57,746
So now I want everybody to

821
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,705
choose one coin, put it in your

822
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,540
right hand, put your right hand

823
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,126
out.

824
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,338
Three, two, one, reveal.

825
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,339
Courtney's decided she wants to

826
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,131
eat.

827
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,507
Todd is going to eat.

828
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,634
Denise is going to eat.

829
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,136
And James is going to eat.

830
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,432
Take a spot at your feast bench.

831
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,435
Peih-Gee, Frosti, Amanda, and

832
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,604
Erik are playing to win this

833
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,397
game.

834
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,315
All right, here's how it will

835
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:25,774
work.

836
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,026
When we start, you guys can

837
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,236
begin eating.

838
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,570
You can eat for as long as the

839
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,030
challenge takes, until we have a

840
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,114
winner.

841
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:33,740
The challenge is now beginning.

842
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:37,410
Dig in.

843
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,918
Here we go, first round.

844
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:49,839
Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog.

845
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,841
Go.

846
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,813
Let's see how we do.

847
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:09,693
Tiger, rat is wrong.

848
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:13,738
Erik, take a spot.

849
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,450
Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog

850
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:17,701
is right.

851
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:23,164
Amanda is still in.

852
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,459
Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog

853
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:26,835
is right.

854
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,381
Peih-Gee is still in.

855
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,883
Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog.

856
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,760
Frosti is still in.

857
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,474
Erik, that has got to be tough

858
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,726
now.

859
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,852
You didn't make it one round,

860
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,769
and you're looking at

861
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,646
cheeseburgers, fries, fixings.

862
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,107
>> Can't do anything about it.

863
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,983
I'm going to make the most of

864
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,569
it, sit here, and smell it.

865
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,320
>> PROBST: Courtney, how's that

866
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:53,820
burger?

867
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,780
>> Great.

868
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,656
>> Probably the best food I've

869
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,867
ever had in my life right now.

870
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,160
>> PROBST: We are down to three.

871
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,371
Next round: rat, ram, dragon,

872
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,915
rooster, ram.

873
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:18,762
Frosti struggling to get that

874
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,721
last one.

875
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,389
You're committed to what you

876
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,892
have.

877
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:24,851
>> Come on, Frosti.

878
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,063
Go, Frosti.

879
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,064
>> PROBST: Frosti makes a

880
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:29,981
choice.

881
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,693
Let's find out if he's right.

882
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:38,531
Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram.

883
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:43,578
Rat, ram, dragon, rat is wrong.

884
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:48,833
Amanda has it wrong.

885
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,712
Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram.

886
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,713
Peih-Gee has it right.

887
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,339
That means Amanda, you can take

888
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,007
a seat.

889
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,759
>> Oh, my God!

890
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,301
>> PROBST: It comes down to

891
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,636
this.

892
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,095
Peih-Gee has it right.

893
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,389
Frosti, if you have it wrong,

894
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,682
Peih-Gee wins immunity.

895
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,184
>> I'm going crazy.

896
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,769
I'm losing my mind.

897
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,229
>> PROBST: Rat, ram, dragon,

898
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,855
rooster, ram is what you need to

899
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,108
have to stay alive.

900
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:17,821
Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram.

901
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,115
You got it right.

902
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,157
>> Yay!

903
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:21,783
>> PROBST: You're still alive.

904
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,911
We are down to two-- immunity

905
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,830
and a guarantee of a one-in-

906
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,332
seven shot of winning this game.

907
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,210
Here we go.

908
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,962
Snake, rat, rabbit, tiger,

909
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,048
rooster, ram.

910
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,687
>> Come on, Frosti.

911
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,320
>> PROBST: Snake, rat, rabbit,

912
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,323
tiger, rooster, ram.

913
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,908
What are you upset about?

914
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:04,284
>> I don't know.

915
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,702
I think I lost my mind with

916
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,787
Frosti.

917
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:12,250
>> PROBST: Snake, rat, rabbit,

918
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,087
tiger, rooster, ram.

919
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,422
I think you got it right.

920
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,006
Peih-Gee has it right again.

921
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,840
>> Oh, my God!

922
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,717
>> PROBST: Frosti, you have to

923
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,468
have it right to stay alive in

924
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,094
this.

925
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,848
Snake, the second one was rat.

926
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,142
You have rabbit.

927
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,101
It's over.

928
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:30,935
Peih-Gee wins immunity.

929
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,270
>> Oh, my God!

930
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,773
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

931
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,693
And with that, stop eating.

932
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:39,652
Whatever you got in your mouth,

933
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,320
you can finish.

934
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,196
What's in your hands you need to

935
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,698
set down.

936
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,534
Give you a minute to swallow.

937
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,328
>> I'm covered in mayonnaise.

938
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,413
>> It's on your leg.

939
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,083
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee, the only

940
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,169
thing on day 27 better than a

00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,879
cheeseburger is this right here.

942
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,631

tribal council, one-in-seven

946
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,344
shot at winning this game.

947
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,930
Frosti, Todd, Amanda, Erik,

948
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,098
Denise, Courtney, and James, one

949
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:09,974
of the seven you are going home

950
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,893
tonight.

951
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,268
See you at tribal.

952
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,230
Head on back.

953
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,286
>> How much did you guys eat?

954
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,412
>> I had two burgers and a ton

955
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,748
of fries and two things of cola.

956
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:34,916
And I hated myself for that.

957
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,001
>> It's hard to know that I took

958
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:41,047
a risk, made a sacrifice, and

959
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,966
nothing really came out of it.

960
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,260
I am upset that James, Denise,

961
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,303
Todd, and Courtney sat out.

962
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,304
Like, we're here for 12 more

963
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,222
days.

964
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,014
You can't wait 12 days for a

965
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:54,352
cheeseburger?

966
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,021
>> Frosti, you fought hard.

967
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,148
I did terrible.

968
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,692
>> Not winning immunity today

969
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,360
and having Peih-Gee win means

970
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,570
that we can't vote her out.

971
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,655
So I think Erik kind of already

972
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,864
knows that he's on the chopping

973
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,116
block.

974
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:08,992
>> Well, if I go tonight, good

975
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,661
luck to you.

976
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,662
>> If I go tonight, good luck to

977
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,164
you.

978
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:15,665
And we still didn't get

979
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,251
cheeseburgers.

980
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,711
>> Since Peih-Gee won immunity,

981
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,336
that means Frosti and I are kind

982
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,172
of the obvious ones to go, you

983
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,299
know, probably going to be one

984
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,717
of us.

985
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,678
And Frosti, I feel like he's...

986
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,887
somehow, you know, he's worked

987
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,513
his way... I think he's in good

988
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,223
with Todd and Amanda and

989
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,100
Courtney.

990
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,435
So it definitely makes it seem

991
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,811
like Frosti might be higher up

992
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,188
the ladder than he once was.

993
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,565
But then again, you know, I'm

994
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,524
tight with that group now.

995
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,734
So maybe that puts me up the

996
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,110
ladder as well.

997
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,030
So we'll see.

998
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,784
>> We have to be careful with

999
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,286
Erik, because he's not like

1000
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,162
Peih-Gee.

1001
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,496
He's not overbearing.

1002
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,080
He's not abrasive.

1003
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,249
But he's really good at

1004
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,793
making... especially the girls.

1005
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,211
>> He's smooth.

1006
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,632
>> They love him.

1007
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,257
>> And he plays up the good old

1008
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,010
country boy from Tennessee.

1009
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,970
>> I mean, he's a great guy.

1010
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,180
And, like, he's awesome to have

1011
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,181
around, but just got to be

1012
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,141
careful.

1013
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,059
>> It's like, "Here you go, have

1014
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,437
a million dollars, Erik."

1015
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,063
Tonight's vote's killer.

1016
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,107
I mean, Erik, if he makes it to

1017
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,150
the end, hands down, he's

1018
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,278
guaranteed a million dollars.

1019
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,865
But Frosti's a big threat.

1020
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:31,908
You watch him perform in any of

1021
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,451
the challenges, and he is great,

1022
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,118
you know.

1023
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,036
And that kind of worries me.

1024
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,871
So I don't know what I'm going

1025
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:37,705
to do.

1026
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,874
It's a toss-up.

1027
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:40,208
Frosti and Erik?

1028
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,001
>> One of them guys is leaving.

1029
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,544
>> Has to go.

1030
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,587
We have to get rid of one of

1031
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,963
those two.

1032
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:46,422
I mean, I love Frosti.

1033
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,841
I'll write his name down.

1034
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,676
Courtney is really tight with

1035
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,009
him.

1036
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,178
If we have to, we pull her in to

1037
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,346
get rid of Frosti.

1038
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,473
She'll vote for Frosti.

1039
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,140
>> I'm not sure you want to

1040
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:56,557
trust her, though.

1041
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,393
I mean, she thinks her Frosti's

1042
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,894
with her.

1043
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:00,853
>> Courtney...

1044
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,896
>> We can convince Courtney.

1045
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,523
>> You sure?

1046
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,357
She's loving the hell out of

1047
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,066
Frosti.

1048
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,192
>> If she can't realize that, if

1049
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,902
she really can't realize that,

1050
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,945
maybe we should turn it around

1051
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,698
and get rid of her.

1052
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,782
>> The last tribal council we

1053
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,283
went to, I thought everybody was

1054
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,493
voting for Peih-Gee.

1055
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,244
It turned out everybody was

1056
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,121
voting for JR.

1057
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,414
Tonight I really don't feel

1058
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,873
paranoid, because at least I

1059
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,416
think I know who everybody's

1060
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,250
voting for.

1061
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,335
It's either going to be Frosti

1062
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,129
or it's going to be Courtney

1063
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,090
that goes tonight.

1064
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,761
>> Obviously, and it sucks, but

1065
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,804
what are we at, eight?

1066
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,223
Get rid of Erik or Frosti.

1067
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,641
>> So Erik or Frosti.

1068
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,184
>> Has to, right?

1069
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,061
James and Denise are scared to

1070
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,396
death that you would not be

1071
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,063
willing to vote against Frosti.

1072
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,857
>> Oh, really?

1073
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,649
>> Yeah.

1074
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,817
Yes.

1075
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,277
And would you?

1076
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,236
>> Frosti is kind of like my

1077
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,447
little Munchkin, and you know,

1078
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,282
everyone's kind of worried about

1079
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,158
me because they know that he's,

1080
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,326
you know, like, my good friend.

1081
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,995
>> You've seen him compete.

1082
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,079
I love the kid, but we don't

1083
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,039
have a choice, right?

1084
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,084
>> We'll see how it goes.

1085
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,085
It really does, like,

1086
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,336
strategically make a difference

1087
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,880
whether or not, you know, I go

1088
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,047
with the group on this one or I

1089
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:10,882
don't go with the group on this

1090
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:11,591
one.

1091
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,258
So I don't know.

1092
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,676
I mean, honestly, I don't know

1093
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,472
who I'll vote for.

1094
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,473
>> James and Denise were very

1095
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,891
worried about Courtney and her

1096
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,642
friendship with Frosti.

1097
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,685
I'm worried.

1098
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,728
I mean, we just don't know what

1099
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,062
to expect.

1100
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,273
She could literally take a sharp

1101
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,941
turn right at any moment.

1102
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:29,901
You know, I may have to vote for

1103
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,236
her.

1104
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,179
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1105
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:02,850
the members of our jury, Jaime

1106
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,352
and Jean-Robert, voted out at

1107
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,438
the last tribal council.

1108
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,442
Let's talk about today's

1109
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,944
immunity challenge.

1110
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,821
James, of all the people that

1111
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,948
would choose to eat over

1112
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,449
fighting for immunity, I have to

1113
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,077
say you surprised me the most.

1114
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,620
When you saw that plate of

1115
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,372
cheeseburgers, what was your

1116
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,708
initial thought?

1117
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,793
>> Attack.

1118
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,544
(<i> laughter</i> )

1119
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,878
I ate seven of them.

1120
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,046
>> PROBST: You ate set of the

1121
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:32,880
12?

1122
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,715
>> I ate seven burgers.

1123
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,383
And I would have eaten that last

1124
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,175
one.

1125
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,093
I'm not playing.

1126
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:37,426
I was hungry.

1127
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,887
Yes, I have a strong ability to

1128
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,055
win, and if I would have

1129
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:41,848
competed, I would have competed

1130
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,390
with my whole heart, but I'm

1131
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:46,561
telling you, it was meat, man.

1132
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,895
>> PROBST: Todd, you have a one-

1133
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,230
in-even shot if you win today's

1134
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,189
challenge, and yet you opted for

1135
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,275
food.

1136
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,484
>> The second you took the lid

1137
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,486
off of those burgers and fries,

1138
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,321
fat kid inside of Todd said,

1139
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,407
"Food, eat, you are so hungry,"

1140
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,367
you know?

1141
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,994
And it's very risky putting

1142
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,954
yourself in that situation,

1143
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,080
especially when you tell

1144
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:07,206
yourself you would never do it.

1145
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,250
>> PROBST: Frosti, why did you

1146
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,503
choose to not eat?

1147
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,630
>> Well, I know that being here,

1148
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,756
there's always a chance that you

1149
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,883
could go home, no matter how

1150
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,634
comfortable you feel, and that's

1151
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,052
a chance that some people

1152
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,637
decided to take.

1153
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,430
But I want to know that I've

1154
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,058
done everything I can to do my

1155
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,186
best, to try my hardest, so that

1156
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,397
if I do go home, I know that

1157
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,273
it's not because I didn't do

1158
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,442
everything I could.

1159
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,443
>> PROBST: Erik, of the four

1160
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,904
people that chose to sit out, do

1161
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,071
you think it's a sign that they

1162
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,406
are comfortable enough with

1163
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,866
their status in the tribe that

1164
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,242
they can eat and still be here

1165
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,952
at the end of this tribal?

1166
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,453
>> I knew I had to do the

1167
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,788
challenge, so that definitely

1168
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,415
draws a distinction between

1169
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,875
where I am and where the people

1170
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,417
that were eating are.

1171
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,169
>> PROBST: Where are you in this

1172
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:53,377
tribe?

1173
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,838
>> I feel like I'm honestly

1174
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,089
somewhere at the bottom, and

1175
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,591
frankly, tonight I feel like I'm

1176
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,343
very far at the bottom.

1177
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,302
There's a chance I could make it

1178
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,428
through tonight, but I'm not

1179
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,388
necessarily planning on it.

1180
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,514
>> PROBST: We're at a point in

1181
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,891
the game where there are two

1182
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:07,725
different types of

1183
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,392
relationships: strategy

1184
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,811
relationships, then

1185
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,479
relationships that might extend

1186
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,773
after the game.

1187
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,857
Amanda, are those two

1188
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,233
relationships starting to butt

1189
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,318
heads yet when it comes to who

1190
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,903
you vote out?

1191
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,487
>> It's a hard thing, having

1192
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,323
friendships and then trying to

1193
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,116
play this game, because they

1194
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,576
don't always follow the same

1195
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,203
path.

1196
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,205
So it's a hard thing to juggle.

1197
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,373
>> PROBST: Denise, if you make a

1198
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,540
friendship with somebody out

1199
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,959
here, do you expect a little

1200
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,335
more loyalty than somebody that

1201
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,170
maybe they don't like?

1202
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:36,754
>> I mean, you would hope that

1203
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,048
the loyalty would be there, but

1204
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:39,674
there is no loyalty in a game

1205
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,383
like this.

1206
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,885
There is no real down-to-the-

1207
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,427
bottom trust.

1208
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,470
I mean, it's a game.

1209
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,429
I mean, you hope that the

1210
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,390
friendships that you make and

1211
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,975
the bonds that you create over

1212
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,434
all this time will last in the

1213
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,645
end.

1214
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,771
>> PROBST: Frosti, what does it

1215
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,564
say about you that you're still

1216
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,566
here after being selected from

1217
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,526
Fei Long presumably with the

1218
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,570
idea to get rid of?

1219
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,322
>> Well, I do believe that

1220
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,533
forming the relationships that I

1221
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,493
did with the whole tribe really

1222
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,036
did help me.

1223
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,621
And yes, sometimes you do have

1224
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,455
to hurt people that you've

1225
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,125
gotten close to.

1226
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,710
But it is a game, and everyone

1227
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,377
understands that.

1228
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,462
And sometimes in games, people

1229
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,340
get hurt.

1230
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,092
>> PROBST: Erik, does it ever

1231
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,510
feel personal?

1232
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,720
>> Yeah.

1233
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,138
I mean, it's hard, because I

1234
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,264
feel like I've meant to make

1235
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,807
friends too, and at some point,

1236
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,433
there's only so much I can do,

1237
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,351
you know, on the chopping block.

1238
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,894
But of course, as far as, like,

1239
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,520
trying to scheme and, like, get

1240
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,397
myself in good with a select

1241
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,274
few, although somewhat

1242
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,567
necessary, also can be very

1243
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,568
detrimental.

1244
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,485
So I've really tried to be

1245
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,237
careful, and you know, I have

1246
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,863
very few options at this point

1247
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:47,116
tonight, but....

1248
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:47,825
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1249
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,701
get to the vote.

1250
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,410
Peih-Gee, I don't even have to

1251
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,202
ask.

1252
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:50,828
I know you're not giving up that

1253
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,413
necklace.

1254
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,289
Peih-Gee is safe.

1255
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:53,914
You cannot vote for Peih-Gee.

1256
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,292
Everybody else is fair game.

1257
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:56,751
It is time to vote.

1258
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,962
Todd, you're up.

1259
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:16,937
>> One of us will be eating

1260
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,564
cheeseburgers before the other.

1261
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,067
Neither of us deserved it.

1262
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,165
>> It's you and me tonight, bro.

1263
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,542
Nothing personal.

1264
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:50,012
>> I think you're an amazing

1265
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:50,930
person.

1266
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:51,597
I'm sorry.

1267
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,307
I hope we can be friends later.

1268
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,393
Bye.

1269
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:04,693
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1270
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,196
votes.

1271
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,373
Once the votes are read, the

1272
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,415
decision is final.

1273
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,291
The person voted out will be

1274
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,167
asked to leave the tribal

1275
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,919
council area immediately.

1276
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:22,670
If anyone has the hidden

1277
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,921
immunity idol, now is the time

1278
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,340
to play it.

1279
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,553
I'll read the votes.

1280
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:39,186
First vote, Frosti.

1281
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,149
Erik.

1282
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,608
Frosti.

1283
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:49,405
Two votes Frosti, one vote Erik.

1284
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,948
Frosti.

1285
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,283
Three votes Frosti, one vote

1286
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:56,078
Erik.

1287
00:40:56,162 --> 00:41:00,583
Frosti, it's four votes Frosti.

1288
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,626
Ninth person voted out and the

1289
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,170
third member of our jury,

1290
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:04,545
Frosti.

1291
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,172
That's five.

1292
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:06,797
That's enough.

1293
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,216
You need to bring me your torch.

1294
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,726
Frosti, the tribe has spoken.

1295
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,477
>> With cheeseburgers still on

1296
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,146
their breath.

1297
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,565
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.

1298
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,825
Well, you've made it a long ways

1299
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,035
in this game, but there are

1300
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,661
still 12 days left.

1301
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,747
Now, more than ever, the ability

1302
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,958
to adapt moment to moment is

1303
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:43,751
what's going to keep you in this

1304
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,710
game.

1305
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,294
We're going to test that right

1306
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,713
now.

1307
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,634
Tonight you will not be heading

1308
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:56,931
directly back to camp.

1309
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,598
We have more business to attend

1310
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,018
to here.

00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,781
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1318
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,866
from our next episode.

1319
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,327
>> PROBST: Next time on

1320
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,538
<i>Survivor,</i> injuries take their

1321
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,538
toll.

1322
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,790
>> My knees are tore up.

1323
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,708
>> PROBST: James is fed up.

1324
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,918
>> You have to help me out.

1325
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:26,752
I'm not doing all this stuff by

1326
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,836
myself anymore.

1327
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,587
They're going to pull the rope

1328
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,213
with me, or they're all going to

1329
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:29,588
die.

1330
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,298
>> PROBST: And Todd takes a

1331
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:31,674
stand.

1332
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,299
>> I have a very, very strong

1333
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:32,925
opinion, and I'm going to knock

1334
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,093
you down if I have to.

1335
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:34,885
You got to watch your mouth,

1336
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,971
dude.

1337
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,851
>> I expected some people to

1338
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,145
kind of backstab, but I didn't

1339
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:45,729
expect it right now.

1340
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,148
I got beat by the tiny flight

1341
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,401
attendant, the sassy New York

1342
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,485
waitress, and the lady with the

1343
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,236
mullet.

1344
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,071
But you know, I wanted to prove

1345
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,990
that somebody who is younger,

1346
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,616
smaller could come out here and

1347
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,784
do the same job that anyone else

1348
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,120
can do, and I have proved that.
