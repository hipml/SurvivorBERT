00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,427
BIG BATTLE.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,220
THIS IS LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

5
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,263
20 WINNERS.

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:13,847
EVERYBODY WANTS IT.

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,308
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:22,939
YOU ARE WITNESSING 16 AMERICANS
BEGIN AN ADVENTURE THAT WILL

9
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,984
FOREVER CHANGE THEIR LIVES.

10
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,279
FOR THE NEXT 39 DAYS, THEY'LL BE
MAROONED, LEFT TO FEND FOR

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,280
THEMSELVES.

12
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,283
THEY MUST LEARN TO ADAPT OR
THEY'RE VOTED OFF.

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,162
IN THE END, ONLY ONE WILL REMAIN
AND WILL LEAVE THE ISLAND WITH

14
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:51,176
$1 MILLION IN CASH AS THEIR
REWARD.

15

"SURVIVOR," BUT SEEING MY

COMPETITORS, I'M LIKE, OH, MAN.

17
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,146
>> FANS IN SUPER BOWL WAIT ALL
YEAR TO SEE THE GAME AT THE END.

18
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,317
FANS OF "SURVIVOR" HAVE BEEN
WAITING 20 YEARS TO SEE "WINNERS

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,169
I HAVE BEEN BUSY BIDDING A
FAMILY, BUT I'M LIKE A PHOENIX

23
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:39,349
RISING FROM THE ASHES READY TO
BURN DOWN YOUR HOUSE.

24
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,352
>> I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH
HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA.

25
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:48,024
I REMEMBER DREAMING AND PRAYING
THAT I'D BE ALIVE LONG ENOUGH TO

26
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,067
PLAY "SURVIVOR" AGAIN.

27
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:59,285
AND SO IT IS A MIRACLE THAT I'M
SITTING HERE TODAY.

28
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,580
>> I WAS A KID THE FIRST TIME I
PLAYED THE GAME.

THE FALL IN LOVE, MEET MY

SEASON 40 ALL WINNERS?

32
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,510
I WANT TO WIN THE GAME.

33
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:19,222
TO COME OUT HERE AND WIN TWO
TIMES AND BEAT MY HUSBAND AGAIN,

34
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:29,399
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

35
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,026
>> Jeff: IT'S THE BIGGEST
BATTLE IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

36
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,237

LAYING IT ALL ON THE LINE.

TAKES TO OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, AND

HERE THEY COME.

>> YOU GOOD?

59
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:54,317
>> Jeff: YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
WHO YOU ARE PLAYING AGAINST AS

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,362
THEY GET THEIR FIRST LOOK AT WHO
THEY ARE PLAYING AGAINST.

61
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,822
>> WELCOME.

62
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,283

YOU GUYS HIT THE OCEAN YET?

66
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:08,957
>> THE QUEEN.

67
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,668
>> I'M SHOCKED TO SEE ROB AND
AMBER.

68
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:17,423
I SPENT 36 DAYS WITH BOSTON ROBB
ON ISLAND OF THE IDOL, AND

69
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,510
BOSTON ROB NEVER TOLD ME THAT HE
WAS POLITICIAN AGAIN.

70
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,178
>> GOT YOU WIFE HERE, HUH?

71
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,388
>> SO I DEFINITELY FEEL
BETRAYED.

72
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,558
>> GOOD JOB.

73
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,393
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

74
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:28,893
WOW.

75
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,521
LET ME TAKE THIS IN.

76
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,483
20 WINNERS, 20 YEARS IN THE
MAKING.

77
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,237
THIS IS AWESOME.

78
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,532
WENDELL, YOU APPLIED MANY TIMES
TO GET ON THIS SHOW, AND THEN

79
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,827
YOU FULFILLED THE DREAM OF EVERY
PLAYER.

80
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,703
YOU ACTUALLY WON.

81
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,745
WHAT'S THE FEELING?

82
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,041
>> IT'S GOT TO BE THE GREATEST
FEELING IN YOUR LIFE.

83
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,543
I'M AMONGST THE GREATS RIGHT
NOW.

84
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,211
I SEE SOME LEGENDS.

85
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,380
A LOT OF LEGENDS.

86
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,840
19 LEGENDS OUT HERE.

87
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,174
IT FEELS GOOD, MAN.

88
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,884
IT'S THE BEST FEELING.

89
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,387
>> Jeff: YUL, YOU PLAYED 14
YEARS AGO.

90
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,221
>> YEP.

91
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:08,516
>> Jeff: THE iPHONE DIDN'T
EVEN EXIST.

92
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,393
[LAUGHTER]
DO YOU SEE THIS GAME TODAY

93
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,938
THROUGH A DIFFERENT PRISM AS A
MORE MATURE HUMAN?

94
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,064
>> YEAH.

95
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,566
I FEEL LIKE A DINOSAUR THAT'S
BEEN TIME BOMBED INTO THE

96
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,067
FUTURE.

97
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,068
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED.

98
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,571
THE PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED.

99
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,363
"SURVIVOR" HAS CHANGED.

100
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,240
I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
CHANGE.

101
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:25,033
>> Jeff: AMBER.

102
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:25,867
>> JEFF.

103
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,454
>> Jeff: YOU FIRST PLAYED 20
YEARS AGO.

104
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,580
LITTLE PERSPECTIVE.

105
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:35,251
NOT ONLY HAD THE iPHONE NOT
BEENEN VETTED, iTUNES DIDN'T

106
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,588
EXIST, TWITTER, FACEBOOK.

107
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,673
YOU WERE THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO
CAME ON THE SHOW.

108
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,924
YOU END UP MEETING ROB.

109
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,595
YOU GET ENGAGED ON THE SHOW, AND
NOW YOU'VE CREATED A FAMILY WITH

110
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,804
FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.

111
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,933
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU THIS
TIME AS A VERY DIFFERENT WOMAN

112
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,227
THAN YOU WERE THE FIRST TIME?

113
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,272
>> IT'S HONESTLY KIND OF LIKE A
NICE VACATION.

114
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,441
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
WHAT'S FOR DINNER.

115
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,484
I'M NOT COOKING IT.

116
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,152
I'M NOT GOING GROCERY SHOPPING.

117
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,572
THIS IS AWESOME, BUT TO BE
HONEST, TO BE A PART OF SEASON

118
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,242
40, IT'S GOING TO BE THE
BIGGEST, MOST EPIC SEASON YET.

119
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,912
HOW COULD YOU PASS UP THIS
OPPORTUNITY?

120
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,121
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

121
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:17,627
BEFORE WE GET TO IT, LET'S HAVE
A LITTLE TOAST TO CELEBRATE.

122
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,295
>> WOW.

123
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:23,174
>> Jeff: COME ON NOW.

124
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,675
>> WHOA.

125
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,552
>> YEAH.

126
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,471
[APPLAUSE]
>> ARE WE PLAYING "SURVIVOR"?

127
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:35,436
>> Jeff: THIS IS A
ONCE-IN-A-TV-SERIES MOMENT.

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,146
WE GOT TO CELEBRATE IT.

129
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,940
[APPLAUSE]
>> DO IT UP.

130
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:45,196
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> MY COMPETITION HERE IS THE

131
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,825
GREATEST OF THE GREAT, AND IT'S
A GOOD FEELING, BECAUSE WE'RE

132
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,785
ALL HERE TO BE PART OF SOMETHING
SPECIAL.

133
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,911
>> THANK YOU, SIR.

134
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:57,667
>> BUT EVERYONE WILL BE GUNS
A-BLAZEIN', EVERYONE WILL BE

135
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,335
SWORDS A-SWINGING.

136
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,711
THERE WILL BE LIMBS AND HEADS
FLYING EVERYWHERE.

137
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,590
>> Jeff: I JUST WANT TO SAY,
WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE YOU HERE AS

138
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,677
REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR 40th
YOU HAVE EARNED IT, BUT THIS IS

139
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,886
STILL "SURVIVOR."

140
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,347
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE ALL
WON, THERE WILL BE TOUGH TIMES.

141
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,931
YOU WILL BE CHALLENGED.

142
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,016
YOU WILL BE VULNERABLE.

143
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,521
WHEN THOSE MOMENTS HAPPEN, JUST
REMEMBER, YOU BELONG.

144
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,690
TO "SURVIVOR," BECAUSE A DRINK
BEFORE WAR IS ALWAYS A GOOD

145
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,694
IDEA.

146
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,529
[CHEERING]
>> CHEERS, GIRLS.

147
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,029
>> CHEERS.

148
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:33,369
>> GET RID OF THAT.

149
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:36,664
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

150
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:40,751
"SURVIVOR" 40, "WINNERS AT WAR."

151
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:45,047
YOU ARE DIVIDED INTO MEN AND
WOMEN, AND THIS IS NOT HOW WE

152
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:50,052
ARE GOING TO PLAY.

153
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,179
>> OH, WOW.

154
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,306
>> Jeff: LET'S REVEAL OUR
TRIBES.

155
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:53,723
FIND YOUR NAME AND TAKE IT.

156
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,392
>> THANKS, SIR.

157
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,770
>> EVEN THOUGH I'M THE MOST
RECENT FEMALE WINNER OUT HERE,

158
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,732
IT'S PRETTY NERVE-RACKING,
BECAUSE I HAVE NINE OF THE MOST

159
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,026
INTIMIDATING WOMEN RIGHT NEXT TO
ME.

160
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,571
I MEAN, "WINNERS AT WAR"?

161
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,864
IT JUST SOUNDS NASTY.

162
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,741
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY OPEN YOUR
BUFF.

163
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,367
LET'S SEE WHAT'S UP.

164
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:13,743

BLUE IS OVER HERE, JEREMY.

170
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,420
ROB, BLUE IS OVER HERE.

171
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,421
AMBER, RED IS THIS WAY.

172
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:34,889
>> SORRY, ROB.

173
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:35,640

00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,145
SHE IS NOT GOING TO BE DETERRED.

349
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:07,234
AMBER CLOSER AND CLOSER.

350
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:12,322
SARAH REACHING.

351
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,073
NO!

352
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,783
NATALIE PULLS IT BACK.

353
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,118
SARAH'S GOT IT.

354
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:22,916
DAKAL WINS IMMUNITY, SENDING
SELE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

355
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,460
EPIC FIRST CHALLENGE.

356
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,628
WOW.

357
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:36,305
EVERYBODY PLAYING FOR KEEPS ON
THIS SEASON.

358
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,807
WELL, FIRST CHALLENGE OF THE
SEASON LIVED UP TO THE TITLE OF

359
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,934
THE SEASON, "WINNERS AT WAR."

360
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,394
DAKAL, YOU PULLED IT OUT.

361
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,605
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

362
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,273
[APPLAUSE]
FIRE IN THE FORM OF FLINT, AND

363
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:50,694
MORE IMPORTANTLY, NOBODY FROM
DAKAL GOING HOME.

364
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:55,324
HERE'S MAP THE YOUR NEW HOME.

365
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,325
NICE CATCH, SOPHIE.

366
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,871
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT, AND
GOOD LUCK.

367
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:01,705
>> GOOD JOB.

368
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,332
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

369
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,501
SELE, HEADING BACK THE CAMP,
YOU'LL HAVE NO FIRE.

370
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,962
YOU WILL ALSO HAVE NO RICE
WAITING FOR YOU.

371
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,840
BIGGER THAN, THAT SOMEBODY FROM
YOUR TRIBE WILL BE THE FIRST

372
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,344
PERSON VOTED OUT OF WINNERS AT
WAR, AND TO COMPLICATE THINGS A

373
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:20,682
LITTLE MORE, TRIBAL COUNCIL WILL
NOT BE TONIGHT.

374
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,893
IT WILL BE TOMORROW NIGHT.

375
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:27,648
YOU ALL CAME TO PLAY, THIS GIVES
YOU PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE

376
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,398
THINGS HAPPEN.

377
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,528
HERE'S MAP TO YOUR HOME.

378
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,072
HEAD OUT, GOOD LUCK.

379
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,075
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
TOMORROW NIGHT.

380
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:43,205
>> THE LOSE THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE ON DAY ONE,S THAT MY

381
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:48,085
WORST FEAR, BECAUSE WE'RE
PLAYING WINNERS AT WAR

382
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,212
"SURVIVOR," WHICH MEANS THERE IS
NO EASY TARGET.

383
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,424
BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO GO.

384
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,234
>> HOME SWEET HOME.

385
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,403
>> YEAH, RIGHT?

386
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,657
>> GOOD JOB.

387
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,077
>> WE GET TO OUR ISLAND, AND I'M
THINKING, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS

388
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,328
IS HAPPENING.

389
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,582
I WAS JUST SUPER HAPPY TO BE ON
"SURVIVOR" AGAIN, ESPECIALLY AN

390
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,251
ALL-WINNERS EDITION, BUT SEEING
ALL THESE PEOPLE AND REALIZING

391
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:34,256
HOW LONG AGO I PLAYED, IT'S DIE
OF OVERWHELMING.

392
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,966
>> CHECK THIS OUT.

393
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,970
>> IT SAYS, "USE YOUR FIRE
TOKENS TO PURCHASE ANY OF THESE

394
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,096
ITEMS.

395
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,225
PRESENT FIRE TOBINS AT ANY
CHALLENGE, COFFEE AND PASTRY,

396
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,562
SMALL BAG OF BEAN, TWO PILLOW,
TWO BLANKETS.

397
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,772
THE ADVANTAGE IN THE CHALLENGE
IS MORE TOKENS."

398
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:55,777
>> WE'RE GIVEN AN IN-GAME
CURRENCY CALLED A FIRE TOKEN.

399
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,780
IN MY OPINION, THESE TOKENS ARE
GOING TO END UP BEING A HUGE

400
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,740
PART OF THE GAME.

401
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,576
>> THIS FIRE TOKEN CANNOT BE
STOLEN FROM YOU.

402
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,288
IF VOTED OUT, YOU MUST BEQUEATH
IT TO ANY PLAYER STILL IN THE

403
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,539
GAME.

404
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,415
>> I THINK THE WINNER OF THIS
SEASON WILL BE THE PERSON WHO IS

405
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:13,837
ABLE TO USE THE CURRENCY
CORRECTLY.

406
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,882
I AM FROM THE NEWER SEASONS
WHERE WE'RE USED TO TWISTS.

407
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:21,303
WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S
UNPREDICTABLE FACETS OF THE

408
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,182
GAME, SO I THINK MY CHANCES TO
WIN THIS GAME GOT MUCH HIGHER.

409
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,644
>> SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR BAMBOO
AND WOOD.

410
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,479
>> YOU COULD DO LOG CABIN STYLE.

411
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,772
IT RAISES IT EASIER.

412
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,316
>> DO YOU WANT US TO FIND
BAMBOO?

413
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,610
>> I WASN'T SIGNING UP FOR THIS.

414
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,030
>> FURNITURE MAKER WENDELL?

415
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:47,329
>> AFTER WINNING "SURVIVOR"
SEASON 36 "GUEST -- GHOST

416
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,456
ISLAND," I THINK PEOPLE KNOW ME
AS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO

417
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,707
BUILD.

418
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,417
THIS SEASON I WAS TRYING TO COME
OUT HERE AND NOT BUILD AS MUCH.

419
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,585
I WANTED TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS.

420
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,339
I DIDN'T NECESSARILY WANT TO
BUILD THE WHOLE SHELTER AGAIN.

421
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,507
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

422
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,383
WE'LL HAMMER A STAKE IN RIGHT
HERE.

423
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,969
THIS ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

424
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,471
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE BUSY
BUILDING, YOU'RE STUCK AT CAMP.

425
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,682
IT'S LIKE BEING STUCK IN A
CORNER AT PARTY.

426
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,017
>> MADE BY WENDELL DESIGN?

427
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,979
>> SOMETHING LIKE THAT
>> BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS TALENT

428
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,604
POOL IS DIFFERENT.

429
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,855
IT'S ALL WINNERS.

430
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,858
SO I'M GOING TO PLAY MY POSITION
AND BE COOL, CHILL OUT A LITTLE

431
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,194
BIT, JUST GET A READ ON
EVERYONE.

432
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,529
>> I DID NOT THINK I'D SEE YOU
OUT HERE.

433
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,530
>> REALLY?

434
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,909
>> WELL, I MEAN, YOU GOT FOUR
LITTLE ONES AT HOME.

435
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:30,706
>> I KNOW.

436
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,668
IT WASN'T -- IT WAS AN EASY
DECISION, BUT IT WASN'T EASY.

437
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:40,215
I GOT THEM ALL CALENDARS
>> I DID THE SAME THING,

438
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,175
EXCEPT --
>> I MADE A DAISY CHAIN?

439
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,844
>> WHAT'S THE DAISY CHAIN?

440
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,723
>> THE PIECES OF PAPER ALL
LOOPED AN YOU PULL ONE LINK OFF

441
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,598
EVERY DAY
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US ALL

442
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,891
THIS?

443
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,395
>> HONESTLY, "SURVIVOR" HAS BEEN
MY PROFESSION THE LAST 12 YEARS.

444
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,899
THE THING THAT HAS MADE WINNING
THE $1 MILLION SO GREAT IS I'M

445
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,777
ABLE TO SPEND TIME WITH MY KIDS
AT HOME EVERY DAY, AND I DON'T

446
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:06,742
WANT THE CRY ON DAY ONE HERE,
BUT IT'S LIKE I KNOW EVERYBODY

447
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:14,416
DOES THE 9:00 UNTIL 5:00, BUT I
CAN'T.

448
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,918
NOT TOO MUCH, GUYS.

449
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,338
>> JUST WHEN I THINK YOU'RE ONLY
HERE FOR GOOD LOOKS AND LAUGHS,

450
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,091
YOU DO THIS
>> I GET TO GET UP EVERY MORNING

451
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,094
WITH MY DURING AND HANG OUT
PRETTY MUCH ALL DAY EVERY DAY.

452
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:32,267
SO EVEN COMING OUT HERE FOR A
WHILE IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE I'VE

453
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,979
NEVER LEFT THEM FOR MORE THAN A
COUPLE DAYS AT TIME.

454
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:36,938
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

455
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,774
>> HOW YOU DOING, QUEEN IN
>> DON'T THIS THAT

456
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,441
>> LOOKING GOOD.

457
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,568
>> DON'T CALL ME "QUEEN."

458
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,945
IT WILL PUT A TARGET ON MY BACK.

459
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,907
YOU ASK ANYBODY THAT'S A
"SURVIVOR" FAN WHO IS THE QUEEN,

460
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,075
AND THEY WILL TELL YOU IT'S ME.

461
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:52,996
I'M THE ONLY PERSON HERE THAT
KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WIN

462
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,164
TWICE.

463
00:22:54,247 --> 00:23:01,088
THE HISTORY OF "GAME CHANGERS"
IS I GOT TONY VOTED OUT AND

464
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:01,588
SARAH.

465
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,130
"WINNERS AT WAR."

466
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,799
>> WELCOME TO SEASON 40.

467
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,509
>> I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO
UP AGAINST TONEY.

468
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,637
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO UP
AGAINST SARAH.

469
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,474
I PLAYED ON GAME CHANGERS WITH
THEM, AN ME AND TONY HAD IT OUT.

470
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:20,732
>> SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GAME CHANGERS," TONY.

471
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,610
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR
PLOTTING AGAINST ME.

472
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,654
AND QUEEN STAYS QUEEN.

473
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,614
I KNOW EVERYONE WANTS A PIECE OF
ME.

474
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,491
>> YOU HAPPY TO BE HERE?

475
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:29,950
>> OH, YEAH.

476
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:30,742
>> EVEN WITH ME?

477
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,536
>> NO HARD FEELINGS, YOU KNOW
THAT?

478
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,496
>> WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE?

479
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,705
>> STILL UNDER THE BRIDGE.

480
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:46,842
>> THEY ALL WANT WHAT I ALREADY
HAVE, WHICH IS MY CROWN.

481
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,302
>> HOW ABOUT IT FOR SEASON 40,
HUH?

482
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,303
>> YEAH.

483
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,305
>> SEASON 40!

484
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,641
>> OBVIOUSLY I HAVE A HUGE
TARGET ON MYSELF.

485
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:59,479
I JUST WAS ON SEASON 39 WHERE
THEY BUILT AN IDOL OF ME.

486
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,690
>> YOU'RE SORT OF OUR SHELTER
EXPERT.

487
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,526
>> RESIDENT BUILDER.

488
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,529
>> BY LOSING IN THE BEGINNING,
I'M ALREADY PUTTING MYSELF AT A

489
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,531
HUGE DISADVANTAGE.

490
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,574
>> IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME WORK.

491
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,993
IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US, BUT WE
CAN DO IT.

492
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,705
WORK AS A TEAM, YOU KNOW.

493
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,541
FORTUNATELY NOW WE HAVE TO BUILT
A SHELTER AND VOTE SOMEBODY OFF.

494
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,793
THE GAME IS ON ALREADY.

495
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,838
>> CONGRATS ON THE BABY.

496
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,922
>> THANK YOU.

497
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:26,840
>> OH, MAN.

498
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:27,674
>> HI, ROB, MICHELE.

499
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:32,721
>> HI.

500
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,724
DON'T MAKE ME TALK ABOUT ITFUL
OR I'LL IMMEDIATELY START

501
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,766
CRYING.

502
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,976
>> IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE
I'VE PLAYED THE GAME.

503
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:43,940
AND IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE TO BE
PLAYING THIS GAME CONNECTING

504
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:44,816
OVER BABIES.

505
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,527
>> YOU HAVE FOUR KIDS.

506
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:54,075
>> I HAVE FOUR, TOO.

507
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,910
ONCE WAS.

508
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,704
THE LAST TWO TIMES I WAS A
SINGLE GIRL.

509
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,705
>> DO YOU WANT A PICKINGY BACK?

510
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,247
>> YEAH.

511
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,750
>> BUT I'M A MOM NOW.

512
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,918
I'M MARRIED.

513
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,754
AND I LEFT MY TEN-MONTH-OLD BABY
AT HOME WITH MY HUSBAND.

514
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:13,386
OH, MY GOSH, IT'S JUST... IT
HITS ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT HER.

515
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,596
I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR SUPPORT.

516
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,599
BEING A MOM IS A NEW LIFE CHANGE
THAT CAN HELP ME TO RELATE THE

517
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,267
PEOPLE IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
WAY.

518
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,436
SO I'M TOTALLY USING THE MOM
CARD.

519
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,437
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

520
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,065
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS HAVE
FOUR CHILDREN.

521
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:37,077
>> SOMEBODY FOUND SOMETHING THEY
WERE GOOD AT.

522
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,161
>> IT'S NICE TO BE HERE.

523
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,955
>> I'M HAPPY HERE, BRO.

524
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,914
YOU LOOK GREAT.

525
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,792
EVERYTHING GOOD IN
>> EVERYTHING'S GOOD, MAN.

526
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,671
GOING THROUGH CANCER, IT'S HARD,
BUT LIFE AFTER CANCER, THAT'S

527
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,298
WHEN IT REALLY GOT TOUGH.

528
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,677
THE FEAR OF RELAPSE, THE FEAR OF
DEATH, IT'S WITH YOU ALL THE

529
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,469
TIME.

530
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,804
IT'S NOT A WAY TO LIVE YOUR
LIFE.

531
00:25:55,887 --> 00:26:01,142
AND BEING HERE, SAYING YES TO AN
ALL-WINNERS EDITION OF

532
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:01,893
"SURVIVOR," THIS IS LIVING.

533
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,146
>> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
PLAYED?

534
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,231
>> 2004.

535
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:10,819
>> OH, WOW
>> AND I WANT THE RESURRECT THAT

536
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:15,198
27 YEAR OLD YOUNG, INNOCENT, GUY
TO COME BACK AND PLAY THIS GAME,

537
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,950
THE GAME THAT I LOVE.

538
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,036
THE GAME THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.

539
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,832
>> NICE, ETHAN.

540
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,377
[GROWLS]
>> I DID PUSH-UPS YESTERDAY.

541
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,586
I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE.

542
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,799
I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW I PLAY IN
THIS NEW ERA OF "SURVIVOR."

543
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:38,054
LIKE WE PLAYED WITH LIKE NO
IDOLS, NO HIDDEN IMMUNITIES, NO

544
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,681
CHANCE TO GET BACK IN THE GAME.

545
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,892
SO I'M BACK AND I'M READY TO
PLAY, AND EVERYONE BETTER WATCH

546
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,688
OUT.

547
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,064
>> IS THAT A TRAIL UP THERE?

548
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,816
>> ARE WE ON THE TRAIL?

549
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,486
THERE'S NO TRAIL THAT GOES THAT
WAY, THOUGH, SO I THINK WE HAVE

550
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,529
TO KEEP GOING THIS WAY.

551
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,238
>> OKAY.

552
00:26:55,322 --> 00:27:01,202
>> AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOT GO.

553
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:05,749
I'M WEARING BLUE AGAIN.

554
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,082
AND...

555
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:06,374
>> I KNOW.

556
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,375
I KNOW.

557
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,835
>> I WAS THINKING --
>> LOSING THAT VERY FIRST

558
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:13,506
CHALLENGE, I WAS LIKE, OH, MY
GOD, HERE WE GO AGAIN.

559
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,886
I HAD FLASHBACKS.

560
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,721
>> MATSING LOSES FOR THE FOURTH
STRAIGHT TIME.

561
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,933
>> WE LOST EVERY CHALLENGE, SO I
WENT TO EVERY TRIBAL COUNCIL.

562
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:28,730
AT LEAST I HAD THAT ALLIANCE
WITH MALCOLM.

563
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,567
>> IF I COULD BE YOUR MALCOLM,
IT WOULD BE MY DREAM COME TRUE.

564
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,444
>> MY JUNGLE BOY NUMBER TWO.

565
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,570
>> CAN THAT HAPPEN?

566
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,906
>> I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ
SOMEBODY AND HAVE THAT GUT

567
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,573
FEELING.

568
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,575
>> DO YOU HAVE THAT WITH ME?

569
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,743
>> I DO.

570
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,579
>> I HAVE THAT WITH YOU, BECAUSE
I LOVED WATCHING YOU ON

571
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,246
TELEVISION, SERIOUSLY.

572
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,039
>> WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

573
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,082
>> LET'S COUNT.

574
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,042
ONE, THE WORK THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

575
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,252
>> WHERE'S ADAM?

576
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,380
>> WHERE'S DENISE?

577
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,964
>> WE'RE MISSING ADAM.

578
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:55,882
>> AND DENISE.

579
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,760
>> DENISE AND ADAM, THEY WALK
OFF.

580
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,597
REALLY COOKIE MOVES FOR WINNERS
TO DO THAT IS UNHEARD OF.

581
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,474
>> EASY TARGET, ADAM.

582
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,810
>> PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING, AND IT'S SO EARLY IN

583
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,978
THE GAME, YOU DON'T WANT THE
ROCK THE BOAT.

584
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:18,071
WHEN YOU ROCK THE BOAT,
SOMETIMES YOU FALL OUT.

585
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:22,951
>> TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK
>> YUL, SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

586
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:27,789
YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN A LOW
PROFILE LIKE MYSELF?

587
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,957
I CAN'T GO NOWHERE.

588
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,918
>> IS THE PRATSLY WANT THE
IMMUNITY IDOL, ESPECIALLY FOR A

589
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,505
SEASON LIKE THIS, AND OH, MY
GOD, IT TOOK EVERYTHING OUT OF

590
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,842
ME NOT TO JUST TAKE OFF RUNNING
AND LOOK FOR AN IDOL.

591
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,845
>> I KNOW YOU WANT TO --
>> NO, NO, NO.

592
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,054
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

593
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,350
>> I SEEN WHAT HAPPENED TO ME ON
"GAME CHANGERS" MY FIRST 30

594
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:51,855
SECONDS I RAN AROUND THE WHOLE
ISLAND THREE TIMES.

595
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,022
HEY, YOU GUYS DO NICE-NICE.

596
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,358
I'M LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.

597
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,986
I NOVI TO STAY HERE BECAUSE I'M
ON PROBATION.

598
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,487
I'M RIGHT HERE.

599
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,823
I GOT A BRACELET ON.

600
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,991
HOUSE ARREST.

601
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,202
BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T WANT TO
PUT A TARGET ON MY BACK BY

602
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,497
SHOWING THEM THAT I'M BACK TO
THE OLD TONY ANTICS.

603
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,127
SO I WANT EVERYBODY TO GET NICE
AND COMFORTABLE WITH ME, BECAUSE

604
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,005
THEIR GUARD IS SLOWLY COMING
DOWN AS THEY SEE TONY AROUND THE

605
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,173
CAMP ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT.

606
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,509
WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO HERE,
THAT'S WHERE THE SUCKER PUNCH

607
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:28,349
COMES IN.

608
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:33,354
>> PEOPLE SEEMED PRETTY
COMFORTABLE WHEN WE GOT HERE.

609
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,064
THEY WANTED TO WORK ON THE
SHELTER AND DO THIS AND DO THAT.

610
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:41,404
I'M THINKING, AM I SUPPOSED TO
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I DO HAVE A

611
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:46,367
BIG TARGET ON MY BACK, THE FACT
THAT ROB AND I ARE BOTH OUT

612
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,202
HERE.

613
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,370
I HAD A HARD TIME AT FIRST
CHALLENGE.

614
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:53,958
I WAS ROOTING AT MY TEAM -- I'M
GETTING EMOTIONAL -- BUT IT WAS

615
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,377
HARD THE ROOT AGAINST MY
HUSBAND.

616
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,587
I'M HIS BIGGEST FAN.

617
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,047
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE THINK WE HAVE
THIS HUGE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE

618
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,051
WE'RE OUT HERE TOGETHER, BUT I
FEEL LIKE IT'S PROBABLY MORE A

619
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,929
DISADVANTAGE THAN IT IS AN
ADVANTAGE.

620
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,140
BUT I LEARNED A LOT FROM MY
HUSBAND.

621
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,225
THIS GAME NEVER STOPS.

622
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,060
AS SOON AS YOU SIT BACK AN
RELAX, THAT'S WHEN SOMETHING

623
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:12,977
GOES WRONG.

624
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,938
SO I'VE GOT THE TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS TIME.

625
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:24,072
I'VE GOT TO DO IT.

626
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,075
>> I'M SUPER GLAD YOU'RE IN MY
TRIBE.

627
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,077
I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU.

628
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,578
>> REALLY?

629
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,080
YOU CAN PUNCTUATE THAT WITH
MORE.

630
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:32,997
>> WHAT?

631
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,708
>> I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN ASKED
OUT ON A DATE.

632
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,126
I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.

633
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,631
>> WHEN I PLAYED COOK ISLAND, I
TRIED TO PLAY A VERY RATIONAL,

634
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,257
STRATEGIC GAME.

635
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,467
I USED A LOT OF GAME THEORY.

636
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,094
>> IT'S SO NICE TALKING TO YOU.

637
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,303
YOU'RE A SANE HUMAN.

638
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,557
>> BUT THIS SEASON I THINK MY
BIGGEST CHALLENGE WILL BE COMING

639
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,558
IN DISCONNECTED.

640
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,434
I HAVEN'T BEEN PART OF THE
"SURVIVOR" COMMUNITY.

641
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,229
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE
PLAYED WITH EACH OTHER, THEY

642
00:30:56,312 --> 00:31:01,276
KNOW EACH OTHER SOME KIM PLAYED
POKER WITH ROB AND TYSON, SO

643
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,944
THERE'S THAT CONNECTION.

644
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,779
SOME PEOPLE PLAY MULTIPLE TIMES.

645
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,613
WE HAVE BOSTON ROB.

646
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,073
YOU HAVE TYSON.

647
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:07,657
THEY PLAYED TOGETHER.

648
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,783
THEY'RE LIKE BEST FRIENDS.

649
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:11,411
AND THEY NOT ONLY PLAYED
"SURVIVOR" TOGETHER, THEY PLAYED

650
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,122
POKER TOGETHER.

651
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,625
THEY ALSO PLAYED WITH KIM AND
JEREMY.

652
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,961
I REMEMBER WATCHING ONE VIDEO
WHERE TYSON ACTUALLY SAID

653
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,756
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF, HEY,
IF WE'RE EVER ON AN ISLAND, THIS

654
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,966
IS GOING TO BE THE POUR
ALLIANCE.

655
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,803
>> IF WE ALL FIND OURSELVES ON
THE ALLIANCE, WE'LL DEFINITELY

656
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,972
WITH THE POWER ALLIANCE.

657
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:31,389
>> DEFINITELY.

658
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,223
>> OBVIOUSLY.

659
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,141
>> DUH
>> BUT I THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH

660
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,144
PEOPLE LIKE US WHO ARE NOT SUPER
CONNECTED.

661
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,814
>> IT'S ALMOST LIKE ME, NICK,
AND WENDELL ARE MORE OF THE FREE

662
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:45,236
AGENTS, AN YOU HAVE SANDRA,
TOBY, -- TONY AND SARAH WHO ALL

663
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,903
PLAYED TOGETHER.

664
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,865
YOU HAVE KIM, TYSON AND AMBER.

665
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,368
RIGHT NOW I THINK YOU HAVE THE
COOL PERSON ALLIANCE OF KIM AND

666
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:57,665
AMBER AND TYSON, WHO ALL ARE
TELLING JOKES ALL THE TIME AND

667
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,916
LOOKING PRETTY.

668
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,169
THEN YOU HAVE ON THE OTHER SIDE,
THE GRITTY GROUP, WHICH IS TONY,

669
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,671
SANDRA, AND SARAH.

670
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,465
THEY HAVE ALL PLAYED TOGETHER IN
THE PAST.

671
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,635
AND THEN YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF US
IN THE MIDDLE.

672
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,012
I WOULD PUT PIETION AND YUL IN
THAT POSITION.

673
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,140
>> EVERYTHING I HEARD ABOUT YOU
FROM OTHER PEOPLE HAS ALL BEEN

674
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:14,974
POSITIVE.

675
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,352
EVERYONE SAYS GREAT THINGS
>> YOU, TOO.

676
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,188
>> PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HAVING
SHIELDS AROUND.

677
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,733
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A NERD SHIELD
IN YUL.

678
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,819
LY NEVER BE THE SMARTEST PERSON
AS LONG AS I HAVE YUL THERE

679
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,488
TALKING ABOUT PHYSICS OR
WHATEVER.

680
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,032
BUT I THINK THE NUMBER-ONE THING
ON MY MIND IS NOT WHO I WANT TO

681
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:42,877
WORK WITH, IT'S WHO I WANT OUT.

682
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,254
>> I GOT AN OCTOPUS AND CRAB,
TWO OF THEM.

683
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:56,182
>> OH, MY GOD.

684
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,267
>> SO DO YOU WANT TO WORK
TOGETHER THIS SEASON IN

685
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,269
>> THAT WOULD BE A CHANGE,
WOULDN'T IT?

686
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,648
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M ASKING YOU TO
PROM.

687
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,567
>> DO YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A
CORSAGE, TAKE SOME TIME AND GET

688
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,860
SOME FLOWERS AND MAKE IT
OFFICIAL.

689
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:12,573
>> I THINK YOU AND I ARE
PROBABLY KNOW THE GAME BETTER

690
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,536
THAN ANYBODY ELSE, AND I THINK
IF WE WORK TOGETHER --

691
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,873
>> ROB AND I HAVE A HISTORY THAT
IS A CHECKERED PAST, TO SAY THE

692
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,582
LEAST.

693
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,253
ROB WENT AFTER ME IN "HEROES V.

694
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,421
VILLAINS."

695
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,632
AND I WAS PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
HIM GETTING OUT PREMERGE.

696
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,885
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW ROB IS GOING
TO WANT THE PLAY WITH ME?

697
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,263
>> WE HAVE AN UPHILL BATTLE.

698
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,307
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LET THE
NEW SCHOOL PEOPLE DICTATE HOW

699
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,185
IT'S GOING TO GO
>> OH, YEAH?

700
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,311
I LIKE ROB.

701
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,230
I THINK HE'S SOMEONE I CAN
TRUST, BECAUSE I DOUBT THAT HE

702
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,274
HAS VERY MANY OTHER OPTIONS.

703
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,444
>> SO LAST TIME YOU WERE COMING
AT ME.

704
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,113
>> BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET ON THE
SAME PAGE FROM THE BEGINNING.

705
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:57,285
SO I SAID THE MYSELF, SEE IF WE
GET ON THE SAME PAGE FROM THE

706
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,161
OUTSET.

707
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:58,619
>> I'M DOWN.

708
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,620
>> LET'S HAVE FUN.

709
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,621
>> LET'S DO IT.

710
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,000
>> THESE KIDS AIN'T GOING TO
KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM.

711
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,168
>> THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

712
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:10,423
WE HAVE TO THINK LONG-TERM TOO,
WHAT CAN BE ESTABLISHED.

713
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,092
>> HE HAD A STATUE BUILT.

714
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,178
WOULD BE YOU LIKE TO HAVE A
STATUE?

715
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,429
>> NOT YET.

716
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:21,309
>> "SURVIVOR: GUATEMALA," IT WAS
A WHOLE DIFFERENT STYLE PLAY.

717
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,604
COMING INTO THIS I WAS A LITTLE
NERVOUS.

718
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,438
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY
CONNECTED.

719
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,150
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ALL ARE,
I'M NOT.

720
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,319
TYSON AND ROB ARE PRETTY CLOSE.

721
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,198
>> I KNOW WE WON'T GET VERY MANY
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET RID OF

722
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,365
MAJOR TARGETS LIKE ROB.

723
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:41,287
WHEN YOU GET THAT OPPORTUNITY --
HE'S WELL LIKED.

724
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,079
HE'S CONNECTED.

725
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,331
AND HE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THIS
GAME.

726
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:47,210
IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
REMOVE THAT FROM YOUR GAME, WHY

727
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:52,089
WOULD WOW NOT TAKE IT?

728
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,675
>> NAMES ARE GETTING THROWN OUT.

729
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,637
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FOUND MYSELF
WITH ALL THESE WINNERS.

730
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,306
IT'S VERY HUMBLING TO BE AROUND
ALL THESE GREATS.

731
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,142
>> WHOSE NAMES HAVE YOU HEARD?

732
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,644
>> I'VE HEARD YOURS.

733
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,895
>> WHO SAID MY NAME?

734
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:09,482
>>S BE ROB IS PHENOMENAL AT WHAT
HE DOES?

735
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:13,194
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME?

736
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,028
WHY ARE YOU NOT TRUSTING ME?

737
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,155
>> I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER WHO
SAID IT

738
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,156
>> COME ON.

739
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,408
>> IT'S JUST INSANE TO SEE HIM
WORK IN REAL LIFE.

740
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,537
RIGHT, YOU WATCH HIM ON TV, OH,
MY GOD, HOW IS THIS GUY DOING

741
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,538
IT.

742
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,872
>> ONE OF THE GIRLS.

743
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,084
>> SEE THIS RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE
NOT TELLING ME, MAKE ME FEEL

744
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,335
LIKE I CAN'T TRUST YOU, BRO.

745
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,713
>> THEN YOU'RE ON THE RECEIVING
END OF BOSTON ROB'S MAGIC, AND

746
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,007
IT'S LIKE, YEAH, YEAH, BLAH.

747
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:35,633
>> DANNI.

748
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,678
>> DANNI THREW OUT MY NAME?

749
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,136
WHY?

750
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,804
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

751
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,180
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE BOSTON ROB.

752
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,056
>> HERE'S MY INFORMATION.

753
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:42,431
THERE YOU GO, BUD.

754
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,349
YOU GOT IT.

755
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,686
>> WHAT DID SHE SAY?

756
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,520
YOU'RE GOOD.

757
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,272
>> I'M JUST ASKING WHAT SHE
SAID, MAN.

758
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:53,234
>> YOU PLAYED FOUR OR FIVE TIMES
>> I WAS STAR STRUCK AND TOLD

759
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:53,901
HIM EVERYTHING.

760
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,863
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

761
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,907
>> SO LET ME ASK YOU, IF I ASK
YOU A QUESTION RIGHT NOW, WILL

762
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,409
YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH?

763
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,453
SOMEBODY CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME
THAT YOU ALREADY THREW MY NAME

764
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:04,829
OUT.

765
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,454
IS IT TRUE?

766
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,540
>> WELL, I THREW EVERYBODY.

767
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,250
EVERYBODY IS A TARGET, YEAH.

768
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:09,876
>> OKAY.

769
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,085
THAT'S COOL.

770
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:13,921
>> BECAUSE ONE OF MY CONCERNS
WOULD BE ALL THE CONNECTIONS.

771
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:14,964
I HAVE NO CONNECTIONS.

772
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,173
I HAVE NONE.

773
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,426
>> I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND IT, AND
I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE COMING

774
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,263
FROM A PLACE OF BEING OUT HERE
AND DON'T HAVE ANYBODY EITHER.

775
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,265
>> I RESPECT THE FACT THAT DANNI
TOLD ME THE TRUTH.

776
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,102
HAD SHE LIED TO ME IN THE
MOMENT, I WOULD KNOW WITHOUT A

777
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,270
SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT I
COULDN'T TRUST HER.

778
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,439
>> I WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK
WITH YOU.

779
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,443
>> THE FACT THAT YOU TOLD ME THE
TRUTH, I RESPECT THAT SO MUMP,

780
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:41,449
AND I'M TOTALLY WILLING TO WORK
WITH YOU, BUT I NEED.

781
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,286
>> IT LOOKS LIKE THERE MIGHT BE
AN OLD-SCHOOL ALLIANCE COMING

782
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,163
TOGETHER, ETHAN, PARVATI, DANNI,
MYSELF.

783
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,958
THE OLD-SCHOOL GUY, WE GOT A
RAPPORT WITH EACH OTHER.

784
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,252
SEE, THIS IS WHAT THEY DON'T DO,
THE NEW SCHOOL PEOPLE.

785
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,128
THEY DON'T HAVE FUN.

786
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,088
THEY DON'T GET TO KNOW ANYBODY,
YOU KNOW.

787
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,507
>> IF WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS
VOTE TOMORROW, IT WOULD BE

788
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:02,428
MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR US TO
WORK TOGETHER, SHOWING THE NEW

789
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:06,557
KIDS THE ROPES.

790
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,871
>> I DID NOT SLEEP ONE WINK LAST
NIGHT.

791
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,499
WE'RE GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.

792
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,168
>> WE HAVE THE MAKE A DECISION
BY TONIGHT.

793
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:37,338
>> I KNOW
>> AND ONE OUT OF THE TEN OF US

794
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,132
IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON
VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME, AND

795
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,510
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LIVE
ALONE ON THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

796
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,887
I AM SCARED
>> I AM SCARED.

797
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,554
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE.

798
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,555
>> PEOPLE ARE PARANOID.

799
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,473
>> INCLUDING ME.

800
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,517
>> OH, YEAH.

801
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,144
>> I FEEL SO PARANOID.

802
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,188
I DON'T KNOW.

803
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:56,691
>> I KNOW
>> PLAYING WITH WINNERS MAKES

804
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,900
EVERYONE MORE PARANOID.

805
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,486
I ALSO THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT FIRST PERSON BEING

806
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,864
VOTED OUT OF THE GAME THAT YOU
JUST DON'T WANT TO BE THAT

807
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,367
PERSON.

808
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,663
>> WE'RE GOING TO PULL SOMEONE
IN TO VOTE AT BOSTON ROB

809
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,498
>> ME, YOU AND NAT HAVE A GOOD
CONNECTION.

810
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,876
>> I'M SO DOWN WITH THAT
>> I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY.

811
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,546
>> THE PACE OF THE GAME IS WARP
SPEED.

812
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,588
I AM SO UNACCUSTOMED TO THIS.

813
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,174
I HAVE NO CLUE THAT'S GOING ON.

814
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,468
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO
THROW UP RIGHT NOW.

815
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,678
AT THIS POINT I'M WITH ROB.

816
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,723
>> I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE MORE TIME
TO GET INTO THE GROOVE, BUT

817
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:36,897
THERE'S IN TIME FOR THAT.

818
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,606
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

819
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,692
>> WHAT DO I THINK?

820
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,736
>> YEAH?

821
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,573
>> MY RELATIONSHIP WITH JEREMY
STARTED BEFORE

822
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,909
>> YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST
HERE.

823
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,870
NOBODY ELSE
>> I CONNECTED WITH HIM RIGHT

824
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,079
AWAY.

825
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,623
HE WAS MY NUMBER ONE UNTIL HE
GOT BLINDSIDED AND THEN I PLAYED

826
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,876
FOR JEREMY THE REST OF MY
SEASON.

827
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,420
SO IT'S NOT BLOOD, BUT IT'S
PRETTY CLOSE WITH JEREMY.

828
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,966
IF I HAD TO PICK ONE NOW, I
THINK ADAM.

829
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,885
>> MORE THAN DENISE?

830
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,428
>> I DON'T KNOW.

831
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,597
>> WHEN ADAM AND DENISE
DISAPPEARED TOGETHER, THAT WAS

832
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,765
STRIKE ONE.

833
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,559
I DON'T NEED A SECOND REASON TO
TRY AND SAY NO, NOT THEM.

834
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,062
PICK ONE, LET'S GET IT DONE.

835
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,272
>> WHO YOU VOTING OFF?

836
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:21,400
>> DENISE AND ADAM ARE THE ONES
THAT WALKED OFF.

837
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,444
>> THEY GOT LOST, BUT THEY HAD
THE MAP.

838
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,612
>> TAKE YOUR PICK.

839
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,821
>> NAMES ARE BEING THROWN OUT.

840
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,116
NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO PIN 'EM
DOWN, BUT LIKE DENISE IS BEING

841
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,950
THROWN OUT.

842
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,786
ADAM IS BEING THROWN OUT.

843
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,495
ONE, NOT ME.

844
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,579
TWO, IT'S NOT ME.

845
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,789
THREE, IT'S NOT ME.

846
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,623
FOUR, IT'S NOT ME.

847
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,375
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO TALK.

848
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,795
BUT MY GUT IS TELLING ME TO KEEP
ADAM SAFE BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE

849
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,422
GAME, AN HE NIGHT KNOW HOW THE
MANEUVER THROUGH THIS.

850
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,507
SO I GOT TO GO WITH MY GUT.

851
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,468
>> YOU AND DENISE WENT OFF
LOOKING FOR --

852
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,013
>> WE DIDN'T GO LOOK FOR AN
IDOL.

853
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:55,017
>> YOU KNOW HOW THIS GAME GOES.

854
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:55,643
THAT'S GROUP CONSENSUS.

855
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:59,522
EVERYBODY NEEDS A TARGET.

856
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,608
THE EASY TARGET FROM THE GET-GO
WAS YOU AND DENISE.

857
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,486
>> I WENT TO LOOK FOR THE WATER
WELL WITH DENISE.

858
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,281
WERE WE HAVING A STRATEGIC
CONVERSATION ALONG THE WAY?

859
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,199
OF COURSE.

860
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,702
THAT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THE END
OF THE WORLD.

861
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,787
>> ADAM OR JEREMY?

862
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,499
>> THEY SHOULD BE WAY MORE
WORRIED ABOUT NATALIE AND

863
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:23,629
JEREMY'S EXISTING RELATIONSHIP
COMING INTO THIS GAME, ROB AND

864
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:28,342
AMBER'S MARRIAGE THAN ME GOING
OFF WITH DENISE.

865
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:31,512
>> THEY SAID YOU AND ME AS THE
POTENTIAL TARGET

866
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,429
>> OH, GREAT.

867
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,473
>> WE'RE GOING TO FIX THAT
PROBLEM TONIGHT.

868
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,724
>> JEREMY AND NATALIE?

869
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,854
>> NOT SURE, WHICH BUT BETWEEN
JEREMY AND NATALIE.

870
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,523
>> OKAY.

871
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,067
>> WOULD YOU BE WILLING THE TAKE
A BIG SHOT?

872
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:45,860
>> AT WHO?

873
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:50,698
>> SPLITTING UP JEREMY AND
NATALIE

874
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,243
>> ADAM CAME UP TO ME AND HE
SAID, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS OF

875
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,538
SPLITTING THE VOTES BETWEEN
JEREMY AND NATALIE.

876
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,709
>> I DON'T MIND, THAT YOU KNOW,
I'M TELLING YOU, HE'S LOYAL.

877
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,001
>> YOU THINK?

878
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,002
>> ADAM?

879
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:06,213
>> I MEAN, BECAUSE WE GOT A LOT
RIDING ON THIS.

880
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:06,589
>> OKAY.

881
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,882
ALL RIGHT.

882
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:12,595
>> ADAM AND DENISE, NEITHER ONE
OF THEM ARE TRUSTWORTHY, RIGHT?

883
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:16,849
WHEN ADAM AN DENISE RAN OFF, IT
PUT TARGET ON THEIR BACK, BUT

884
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,225
NATALIE AND JEREMY ARE LIKE
THIS.

885
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,809
THEY'RE THING AS THIEVES.

886
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,728
THEY'VE PLAYED TOGETHER.

887
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,565
AND I REALIZE THAT'S IRONIC
COMING FROM ME, BECAUSE MY WIFE

888
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,733
IS IN THIS GAME WITH ME.

889
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:31,071
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS SHE'S ON A
WHOLE OTHER ISLAND.

890
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,741
BUT FOR REAL, THE THREE OF US
WORK TOGETHER UNTIL THE END?

891
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,658
>> YEAH.

892
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,701
I'M IN
>> I'M IN A UNIQUE POSITION.

893
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:40,748
I COULD BASICALLY CHOOSE WHICH
WAY I WANT TO GO.

894
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,749
>> ROB DOESN'T CARE?

895
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,710
>> NEW YORK I DON'T THINK ANYONE
CARES.

896
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,213
>> WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT.

897
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,424
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

898
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:52,426
>> I'M THINKING ADAM.

899
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,428
>> OKAY.

900
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,138
WE JUST DECIDING, RIGHT?

901
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,099
>> NO, WE DID NOT.

902
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,478
>> DANNI OR ADAM
>> THERE'S CASES FOR BOTH.

903
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,813
>> NEW YORK WE GOT TO THINK THIS
THROUGH.

904
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,901
>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE VOTING OUT
EITHER ADAM OR DENISE, BUT THERE

905
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,570
IS THIS OTHER PLAN WHERE IT'S
GOING TO BE NATALIE OR JEREMY.

906
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:17,826
>> SO IT'S WHAT?

907
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,746
>> WE'RE LITERALLY ABOUT TO GO
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

908
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,749
THEY STILL HAVEN'T CHOSEN
BETWEEN DENISE OR ADAM.

909
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,460
IS IT ME?

910
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:29,797
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

911
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,631
>> DUDE, EVERYONE IS LOSING
THEIR MINDS.

912
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,757
>> I KNOW THEY ARE.

913
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,010
>> DO YOU THINK EVERYONE IS JUST
DUMB OR REALLY SCARED?

914
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,595
>> I DON'T KNOW.

915
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,641
I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE LIKE LOOK,
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW STUPID THIS

916
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,850
FEELS?

917
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,853
LIKE YOU AND I ARE PROBABLY THE
BIGGEST TARGETS, AND I DON'T

918
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,106
THINK FEEL TOO WORRIED
>> ME EITHER.

919
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:47,982
>> LIKE WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

920
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,442
THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THE%
WAY IT IS.

921
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:56,198
I KNOW, USUALLY WHEN YOU FEEL
>> ROB AND I ARE LIKE, ARE WE

922
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:56,740
BEING PUNKED?

923
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,700
>> THIS IS PRETTY BAD.

924
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,785
WE HAVE THE PLAY "SURVIVOR" FOR
EVERYBODY.

925
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,620
THE TWO OF US ARE PLAYING FOR
TEN PEOPLE.

926
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:05,165
>> WE ARE VERY OBVIOUSLY THE TWO
BGGEST THREATS THIS THIS GAME,

927
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:11,714
AND WHAT IS GOING ON?

928
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:16,844
PEOPLE ARE SO TERRIFIED TO SAY
THE NAME OF SOMEBODY, BUT PAST

929
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,553
CHICKEN.

930
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,346
WE HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

931
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,515
IF YOU DON'T TELL WHITE HOUSE
THE VOTE IS GOING TO BE, THEN

932
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,142
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT
TRIBAL?

933
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:29,648
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A
VERY FULLY BAKED PLAN.

934
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,482
SADDLE UP, KIDS.

935
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:35,571
IT'S GOING TO BE A BUMPY RIDE.

936
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,105
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.

937
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,106
GRAB A TORCH.

938
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,777
DIP IT IN, AND GET FIRE.

939
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,198
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS

940
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,241
GAME, FIRE STILL REPRESENTS YOUR
LIFE.

941
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,743
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

942
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,913
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE FOR
SOMEBODY TONIGHT.

943
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:31,794
SO ETHAN, LET'S START WITH JUST
THE CULTURE SHOCK OF BEING BACK

944
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:37,800
OUT LIVING IN A JUNGLE SLEEPING
ON BAMBOO.

945
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,051
WHAT'S IT BEEN LIKE?

946
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,471
>> I MEAN, THE PACE OF THIS GAME
IS SHOCKING TO ME COMPARED TO

947
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,889
THE LAST TIME I PLAYED.

948
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,016
THAT WAS LIKE GLACIAL SPEED.

949
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,810
>> Jeff: YOU'RE NOT EVEN
TALKING ABOUT SHELTER.

950
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,771
YOU'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT
STRATEGY?

951
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,438
>> OH, YEAH.

952
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,731
WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT SHELTER?

953
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:58,278
>> Jeff: ROB, LIKE ETHAN, IT'S
BEEN A WHILE SINCE YOU PLAYED.

954
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,613
ARE YOU FEELING, THAT AS WELL?

955
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,781
>> ABSOLUTELY.

956
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,865
THE GAME HAS EINVOLVED.

957
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,951
IT'S NOW AT PACE THAT'S
LIGHTNING FAST, AND YOU GET IN

958
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,286
LINE OR GET OUT.

959
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,413
>> Jeff: WOW.

960
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,666
>> JEFF, WE LANDED ON THAT
BEACH, AND THERE WERE PEOPLE

961
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,627
THAT WERE GONE, LITERALLY GONE.

962
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:19,466
>> Jeff: JEREMY, WHO WAS
MISSING?

963
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,136
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.

964
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:26,765
>> Jeff: DENISE, THE TRIBE
LIVES TOGETHER, KNOWS WHAT

965
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,934
HAPPENED, AND THERE'S RELUCTANCE
TO TELL ME.

966
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,311
I JUST WANT TO BE A PART.

967
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:31,854
IT'S ME.

968
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,938
IT'S ME
>> YES.

969
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,148
YES.

970
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,192
WELL, I'LL THROW MYSELF UNDER
THE BUS BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE

971
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:42,322
DUMMIES THAT TOLD -- PULLED THE
WORST "SURVIVOR" MISTAKE.

972
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,615
ADAM AND I HAD THE MAP.

973
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,159
WE TRIED THE FIND THE WATER
WELL.

974
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:45,784
WE GOT LOST.

975
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,119
WE WERE GONE WAY TOO LONG.

976
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,955
AS INNOCENT AS IT MAY HAVE BEEN,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

977
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:50,747
PERCEPTION IS EVERYTHING.

978
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:54,835
SO I'M NOT STARTING ON A GRAND
NOTE.

979
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,297
>> Jeff: ADAM, IN A SEASON OF
WINNERS, IT'S TOUGH TO USE AS

980
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,300
THE EXCUSE, I GOT LOST.

981
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,801
>> DENISE AND I MET YESTERDAY.

982
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,887
AND THIS IS THE RELATIONSHIP
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

983
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,849
THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE WHO GO
BACK YEARS.

984
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,519
WE HAVE ONE PERSON HERE WHO IS
MARRIED TO SOMEBODY ELSE ON THE

985
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,687
CAST.

986
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,565
>> THERE'S A REASON TO VOTE OFF
EVERY SINGLE PERSON UP HERE.

987
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,858
EVERYBODY HERE HAS WON THE GAME.

988
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,194
EVERYBODY HAS A TARGET.

989
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:25,199
>> Jeff: NATALIE, THE FIRST
TRIBAL OF ANY SEASON COMES WITH

990
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:30,078
ONE CLOUD THAT JUST LOOMS OVER,
WHICH IS, OH, JUST PLEASE NOT

991
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,288
FIRST.

992
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,541
DOES THAT GO THROUGH YOUR HEAD,
BECAUSE IN YOUR SEASON, YOUR

993
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,834
SISTER WAS VOTED OUT FIRST.

994
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,044
>> YEAH.

995
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:42,424
I CAN PUT MY FEET IN NADIYA'S
SHOES, BUT I THINK I HAVE IT WAY

996
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,675
WORSE.

997
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:48,013
ONE, I HAVE EDGE OF EXTINCTION
WAITER FOR ME, AND TWO, THIS IS

998
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,181
"WINNERS AT WAR."

999
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,059
THERE'S A LOT MORE PRESSURE ON
ALL OF US SO WHETHER IT'S A

1000
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:57,105
SCAPEGOAT EXCUSE OR NOT, ONCE
THAT SEED HAS BEEN SET, THAT

1001
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,315
PICKS UP SPEED.

1002
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,692
BEFORE THEY KNOW IT, THAT
HAPPENED, THEY WENT OUT

1003
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,944
TOGETHER, AND IF THAT'S THE
REASON I CAN USE, THAT'S PART OF

1004
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,737
THE STRATEGY.

1005
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,696
>> Jeff: ADAM.

1006
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,906
YOU CAN'T BE FEELING ANY BETTER
AT THIS POINT.

1007
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:11,370
>> NO.

1008
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,372
>> WE'RE WINNERS AT WAR, JEFF.

1009
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:17,209
EVERYONE IS HOLDING A LOADED
REVOLVER BEHIND THEIR BACK, SO

1010
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:23,048
NO ONE SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE,
AND PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE DO

1011
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:23,840
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

1012
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,218
>> Jeff: NOBODY SHOULD AND A
LOT DO.

1013
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,302
JEREMY, THERE IT IS.

1014
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,097
>> YEAH, I DON'T LIKE THAT
ANSWER THAT SHE GAVE AT ALL

1015
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,306
ACTUALLY.

1016
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,101
I THINK WHEN YOU COME TO TRIBAL,
THOUGH, THIS IS WHERE YOU FIND

1017
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:38,105
OUT WHO HAS YOUR BACK AND WHO
YOU CAN COUNT ON LATER ON.

1018
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,149
>> Jeff: SO BEN, WHAT DO YOU
DO, KNOWING TRIBAL IS LOOMING

1019
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:45,195
BUT NOBODY WANTS TO SAY WHO THEY
THINK IT SHOULD BE?

1020
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,447
>> MY HEART IS RACING RIGHT NOW.

1021
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,741
IT'S JUST HONESTLY POUNDING.

1022
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,494
I KNOW YOU JUST ASKED THE
QUESTION, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW

1023
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,662
WHAT IT WAS.

1024
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:57,124
>> Jeff: MICHELE, EVEN AS I
ASK BEN, YOU PUT YOUR HANDS IN

1025
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,001
YOU FACE.

1026
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:04,089
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M A CALM PERSON
IN MY REGULAR LIFE, THAT'S HOW I

1027
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:08,302
PLAYED THE LAST GAME, BUT EVERY
WORD CAN BE SKEWED AND TWISTED.

1028
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,761
MY HEAD IS ON A SPINNER.

1029
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,305
I FEEL LIKE I'M TRYING TO HOLD
ON.

1030
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,057
>> JEFF, I'M NOT THE CALMEST
PERSON ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE

1031
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,811
GAME, AND YOU PUT ME IN HERE AND
IT'S WAR OF THE WORLDS GOING ON.

1032
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:18,979
YOU'RE JUST FREAKING OUT.

1033
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,189
I THINK THERE ARE PLANS IN
PLACE, PEOPLE THAT WERE OUT HERE

1034
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:26,153
TELLING ME, BUT NOW WHEN PEOPLE
ARE LIKE, MICHELE'S DROPPING

1035
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,989
BOMBS LIKE ANXIOUS PEOPLE, NOW
IT'S ALL IN MY HEAD.

1036
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:29,990
IT'S PARALYZING.

1037
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,825
>> Jeff: THAT'S A FASCINATING
THING.

1038
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,995
SO EVERYBODY HERE HAS WON THIS
GAME, AND EVERYBODY HERE IS

1039
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:35,829
SAYING THEY'RE PANICKED.

1040
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:40,167
>> BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS
NERVOUS

1041
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,002
>> THAT'S COMFORTING.

1042
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,503
>> MY ENTIRE SEASON.

1043
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,422
>> NOT TO MENTION IT'S $2
MILLION.

1044
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,633
WE DIDN'T BRING THAT UP FOR
CONVERSATION.

1045
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,968
LIKE THE BIGGEST PRIZE EVER IN
THE HISTORY OF "SURVIVOR."

1046
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:54,222
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING
THROUGH PEOPLE'S MINDS, AS WELL.

1047
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:54,723
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1048
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,516
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1049
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:05,192
ADAM, YOU'RE UP.

1050
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:05,942
>> OKAY.

1051
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:13,200
PLEASE LET THIS NOT BE ME
TONIGHT.

1052
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:21,875
>> IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

1053
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:40,018
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

1054
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,037
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

1055
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:04,459
WANT THE PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

1056
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,628
OKAY.

1057
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:13,260
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1058
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:18,932
FIRST VOTE DENISE.

1059
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,643
ADAM.

1060
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,144
DENISE.

1061
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:29,276
TWO VOTES DENISE.

1062
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:34,281
NATALIE.

1063
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,449
NATALIE.

1064
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,076
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES DENISE,
TWO VOTES NATALIE, ONE VOTE

1065
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,164
ADAM.

1066
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:47,794
NATALIE.

1067
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,962
NATALIE.

1068
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:56,261
THAT'S FOUR VOTES NATALIE, TWO
VOTES DENISE, ONE VOTE ADAM.

1069
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:59,264
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: WINNERS AT WAR,"

1070
00:50:59,347 --> 00:50:59,639
NATALIE.

1071
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,015
THAT'S FIVE.

1072
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:00,724
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1073
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:11,318
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1074
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:15,322
NATALIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1075
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,408
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1076
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:54,778
>> BEQUEATH YOUR FIRE TOKEN TO
ANY PLAYER STILL IN THE GAME.

1077
00:51:54,861 --> 00:52:31,398
>> BEQUEATH YOUR FIRE TOKEN TO
ANY PLAYER STILL IN THE GAME.

1078
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:36,278
I DON'T THINK IT'S HIT ME THAT I
JUST GOT VOTED OFF FIRST.

1079
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:39,239
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

1080
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,742
HOLDING MY OWN TORCH, I HAVE
NEVER PICKED UP A TORCH AT

1081
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,952
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1082
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:47,789
I HAVE NEVER GOT VOTED OFF, BUT
AFTER SO MUCH EXPECTATIONS FOR

1083
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,376
MYSELF HERE ON EDGE OF
EXTINCTION, I THOUGHT I WOULD BE

1084
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:57,591
CRYING, BUT I'M JUST MAD.

1085
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,426
THIS IS THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

1086
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:04,306
YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK HARD FOR
EVERYTHING.

1087
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:08,101
IF LONLINESS SETS IN, YOU MUST
FIND RESOLVE TO OVERCOME.

1088
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:12,480
IF YOU ARE INDUSTRIOUS, YOU CAN
EARN FIRE TOKENS TO HELP YOU GET

1089
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,773
BACK IN THE GAME.

1090
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:18,278
IF AT ANY POINT YOU WISH TO END
YOUR ADVENTURE, RAISE YOUR SAIL

1091
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,615
AND THE BOAT WILL PICK YOU UP.

1092
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,908
THE TOKENS ARE COOL.

1093
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,784
THE SIGN SAYS "BACK IN THE
GAME."

1094
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,330
THAT MIGHT BE IN LIMBO FOR NOW,
BUT THERE IS STILL A CHANCE FOR

1095
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:39,466
ME.

1096
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,467
>> SO YUL, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

1097
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,469
ARE YOU A FREE AGENT?

1098
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,179
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY.

1099
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,806
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO WORK WITH

1100
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,975
ME.

1101
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,226
>> THAT'S MY PHILOSOPHY.

1102
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,355
>> ME, TOO, ESPECIALLY IF PEOPLE
ARE ALREADY LIKE FAMILY OUTSIDE

1103
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,441
THE GAME.

1104
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,151
HOW DO YOU INFILTRATE THAT?

1105
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,153
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M MOSTLY
WORRIED ABOUT.

1106
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:00,779
>> WHAT?

1107
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:01,321
>> FAMILY.

1108
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,156
>> THEY ARE.

1109
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:06,993
>> IT'S VERY RARE FOR ME THE
TAKE SOMETHING SO PERSONAL, AND

1110
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,330
TO FEEL SO HURT ABOUT IT, BUT
BACK ON ISLANDS OF THE IDOL,

1111
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:14,501
BOSTON ROB TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD
NEVER COME OUT HERE.

1112
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,295
AFTER SPENDING 36 DAYS WITH
BOSTON ROB AND LISTENING TO HIM

1113
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,131
SAY THAT HE WOULD NOT COME OUT
HERE --

1114
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:24,511
>> WAIT, HE FLAT OUT SAID "I
WON'T PLAY?

1115
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,514
>> FTS
>> HE SAID, "I WILL NOT PLAY.

1116
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,016
>> HE LIED TO YOU FOR 36 DAYS.

1117
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,477
>> I SAID I DIDN'T WANT THE PLAY
WITH MY EMOTIONS.

1118
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,980
I WANTED TO PLAY A STRATEGIC
GAME.

1119
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:38,024
BUT IT'S JUST THAT EVERY TIME I
SEE AMBER, WHICH IS ALL DAY, I

1120
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,192
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

1121
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:43,029
SO IF THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES,
AMBER WOULD BE THE AMONG THE

1122
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,365
FIRST TO GO IF I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

1123
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,367
>> WE HAVE THE STICK TOGETHER.

1124
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,370
>> I AGREE.

1125
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:54,082
I THINK WE SHOULD GROUP THE ODD
ONES OUT.

1126
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,166
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE ODD ONE OUT.

1127
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,877
>> SO WOULD YOU HAVE ANY
PROBLEMS TRYING THE BREAK UP

1128
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,589
THAT WHOLE THING, THAT POKER
THING?

1129
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:06,052
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO RECRUIT
SOLDIERS INTO THEIR ALLIANCES.

1130
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,389
SARAH AND SANDRA, THEY'RE TRYING
TO ALIGN ALL THE UNCONNECTED

1131
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,350
PEOPLE, BUT THAT ALLIANCE, WHICH
IS BASICALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE

1132
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,728
ONE-TIM PLAYERS AND FAIRLY
DISCONNECTED FROM OTHER WINNERS,

1133
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,856
IS ACTUALLY THE ALLIANCE THAT
I'VE BEEN ORGANIZING, AND THAT

1134
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,443
IS ME, NICK, WENDELL, AND
SOPHIE.

1135
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,570
WENDELL, SO ARE YOU TOTALLY ON
BOARD WITH US?

1136
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,697
>> 100%.

1137
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,240
I'M LOCKED AND LOADED.

1138
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,868
>> WE'RE IN A WAY BETTER
POSITION THAN I EVER THAWING WE

1139
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,119
WOULD BE COMING INTO THIS GAME.

1140
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,748
THE FACT THAT I WAS WORRIED THAT
BEING UNCONNECTED WE WOULD BE AT

1141
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,041
A DISADVANTAGE.

1142
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,418
THE FACT THAT WE ARE UNCONNECTED
AN WE'RE IN THE CENTER GIVES US

1143
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,087
ALL THE LEVERAGE, SO THAT'S
HELPFUL.

1144
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,590
I THINK SANDRA REALLY IS GUNNING
FOR ROB.

1145
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:49,095
>> I BELIEVE THAT AMBER AND ROB
SHOULD DEFINITELY GET TO THE

1146
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:49,637
EDGE OF EXTINCTION AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE

1147
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,513
>> YEAH.

1148
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,766
>> I AM LOCKED AND LOADED WITH
OUR FOUR.

1149
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,767
>> YEAH.

1150
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,726
>> OKAY.

1151
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,603
I AM WARY ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE
OUT OF OUR FOUR.

1152
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,814
>> THE GREAT THING IS I DON'T
THINK PEOPLE EVEN KNOW THIS

1153
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:00,982
ALLIANCES EXISTS.

1154
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:05,278
WITH SANDRA AS WELL AS WITH
SARAH, WE'LL HAVE THE NUMBERS.

1155
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,405
IN FACT, WE'LL CONTROL THE GAME.

1156
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,498
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1157
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,792
>> ALL RIGHT.

1158
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,627
BETTER THAN I WAS LAST NIGHT I
SUPPOSE.

1159
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,961
>> ALL RIGHT.

1160
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,255
TRIBAL PROBABLY COULDN'T HAVE
GONE WORSE.

1161
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,800
IT SUCKED THAT NATALIE WENT
HOME, BUT IT SUCKED MORE THAT I

1162
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,135
WAS LEFT OUT OF THE VOTE.

1163
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,097
I WENT INTO THIS FEELING LIKE SO
MUCH PRESSURE, BECAUSE I FEEL

1164
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,016
LIKE I HAD SOMETHING TO PROVE.

1165
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,394
PEOPLE WERE A BIT SURPRISED BY
MY WIN WHEN I WAS UP AGAINST

1166
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,605
PEOPLE WHO PLAYED BIGGER,
TRASHIER GAMES THAN ME.

1167
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,650
>> THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR,"
MICHELE.

1168
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:47,612
>> AND NOW TO NOT HAVE THE
NUMBERS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE

1169
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,322
CASE SCENARIO.

1170
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:53,451
>> ROB AND PARVATI ARE PULLING
THE WOOL OVER OUR EYES

1171
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,412
>> ROB IS PRETENDING HE'S NOT
RUNNING THE SHOW, AND HE'S

1172
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,539
RUNNING THE SHOW.

1173
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,499
>> THIS OLE-SCHOOL CAMP IS
INTIMIDATING.

1174
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,127
THEY'RE GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO.

1175
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,713
SO MYSELF, MICHELE, JEREMY, AND
ADAM, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW

1176
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,050
TO STOP THIS LEASH LEADING,
BECAUSE WE'RE LIKE A BUNCH OF

1177
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,678
GOATS.

1178
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:15,515
WE CAN TAKE CONTROL OF THIS PART
OF THE GAME.

1179
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,432
>> OKAY.

1180
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:16,724
COOL.

1181
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:20,311
>> OKAY.

1182
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:25,150
>> IT REALLY SUCKED LOSEING.

1183
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,528
BUT THIS SEASON WHEN SOMEBODY
GETS VOTED OUT, THEY CAN

1184
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,405
BEQUEATH A FIRE STOKEN WITH
ANYONE IN THE GAME.

1185
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,656
WE ALL STARTED OFF WITH ONE FIRE
TOKEN.

1186
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,868
THIS MORNING I SEE A FIRE TOKEN.

1187
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:35,410
YEAH, NAT.

1188
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,870
I KNEW YOU HAD MY BACK.

1189
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,205
I'M GOING TO GET 'EM FOR YOU,
THOUGH.

1190
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,040
SO NOW I GOT TWO FIRE TOKENS.

1191
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,333
TWO IS BETTER THAN ONE.

1192
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,043
I HAVE THE MOST OUT OF ANYBODY
HERE.

1193
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,712
SO I'M THE RICHEST ON THIS
ISLAND.

1194
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,631
NOBODY KNOWS HOW VALUABLE THEY
ARE, SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE TWO OF

1195
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,883
THEM.

1196
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,386
AND LET'S JUST WAIT ON IT AND
SEE WHERE THIS GAME STARTS GOING

1197
00:57:53,469 --> 00:58:03,479
TO SEE HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE.

1198
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:07,692
TO SEE HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE.

1199
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:13,781
>> WHAT IS THIS?

1200
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,581
EDGE OF EXTINCTION KIT.

1201
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:25,752
USE FIRE TOKENS TO PURCHASE ANY
OF THE FOLLOWING.

1202
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,838
IDOL WITH FULL POWER THREE
TOKENS.

1203
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:34,844
ONE PIZZA, PEANUT BUTTER, BOTTLE
OF WINE, SIX PACK OF COLD BEER.

1204
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,055
ALL RIGHT.

1205
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,264
I HAD ONE TOKEN.

1206
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,601
I HAD TO GIVE IT UP BEFORE I GET
HERE, SO I'M THINKING ABOUT

1207
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,103
WHAT'S THE KEY TO ME
ACCUMULATING ENOUGH TO EITHER

1208
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,732
GET AN IDOL OR GET AN ADVANTAGE
IN THE CHALLENGE?

1209
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:53,238
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW THE
BOTTLE.

1210
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,741
THIS IS YOUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY
TO GET BACK IN THE GAME BY

1211
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,452
EARNING A FIRE TOKEN.

1212
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:04,332
JOURNEY TO THE LAST SPOT YOU CAN
SEE THE SUN SET.

1213
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:07,794
IT DID MAKE ME EXCITED THAT I
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET BACK INTO

1214
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,296
THE GAME AND HAVE A SHOT AT THAT
$2 MILLION.

1215
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:15,468
THAT'S STILL UP ON THE TABLE FOR
ME.

1216
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:17,178
RISES IN THE EAST, SETS IN THE
WEST.

1217
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,846
I'M NOT GOOD AT RIDDLES.

1218
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:23,476
MY NIZ CAL STRENGTH IS SOMETHING
I ALWAYS RELY ON, BUT I'M

1219
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:24,978
EMBRACING TESTING MY MENTAL
STRENGTH.

1220
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,146
I REMEMBER THE SUN RISING IN ONE
SPOT.

1221
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:37,198
SO I THOUGHT IF I GET HIGHER I
WOULD SEE THE SUN SET.

1222
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:42,870
SO I THOUGHT IF I GET HIGHER I
WOULD SEE THE SUN SET.

1223
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:47,000
OH, MY GOD.

1224
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,793
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS LIKE A MILE.

1225
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:52,505
AT THE TOP OF THE ISLAND, MY
QUADS ARE JUST BURNING.

1226
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:55,300
IT SAID THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO
WORK HARD FOR EVERYTHING, BUT

1227
00:59:55,383 --> 01:00:00,471
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH HARDER IT
CAN GET OUT HERE TO GET TOKENS.

1228
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,349
KEEP GOING UNTIL THE LAST PLACE
I CAN SEE THE SUN SET.

1229
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,769
MY FIRST TIME AROUND PLAYING IN
NICARAGUA, NADIYA, MY TWIN

1230
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,980
SISTER WAS THE FIRST VOTED OFF.

1231
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,692
THAT FORCED ME TO GRIND UNTIL I
WON THAT SEASON.

1232
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:26,706
>> Jeff: THE WINNER OF
"SURVIVOR: SAN JUAN."

1233
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,915
>> THAT FORCED ME TO WORE HARD.

1234
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:35,506
I DIDN'T COME HERE.

1235
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,552
>> YOU CAN SELL THIS TO ANY
PLAYER FROM A LOSING TRIBE FOR

1236
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:40,845
ONE FIRE TOKEN.

1237
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:43,389
>> ON THE PLAQUE WAS
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW I COULD GET

1238
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,850
MY FIRST TOKEN ALONG WITH THIS
LITTLE POUCH.

1239
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,769
THE POUCH WAS AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1240
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:51,272
EVEN THOUGH I WANT THE KEEP THE
IDOL, IT HAS NO VALUE ON THIS

1241
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,565
BEACH.

1242
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:55,193
I HAVE TO PICK A PERSON FROM THE
LOSING TRIBE, AND THEN THEY WILL

1243
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:59,072
HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BUY MY
IMMUNITY IDOL IN EXCHANGE FOR

1244
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,574
THEIR TOKEN.

1245
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:03,868
I'M FIRST PERSON HERE, AND I'M
ALREADY AFFECTING THE GAME.

1246
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:07,747
THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM
THE LAST EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

1247
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,541
SO ALTHOUGH I DON'T GET THE
EXCITEMENT OF HAVING AN IDOL AND

1248
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,586
POLITICIAN AN IDOL, THINGS I DO
HERE HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT ON THE

1249
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:14,670
GAME.

1250
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,256
IT CAN END UP CHANGING THE
ENTIRE COURSE OF THE SEASON.

1251
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,593
DURING THE GAME, STILL PLAYING
FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

1252
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:23,012
AMAZING.

1253
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:56,754
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1254
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,133
DAKAL GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
THE NEW SELE TRIBE.

1255

1256
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,055

YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

1258
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:08,975
>> YES.

1259
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,602
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
SANDRA, GOT TO TAKE IT BACK.

1260
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:15,523
THANK YOU.

1261
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,151
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

1262
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:22,697
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO PADDLE OUT AND RETRIEVE

1263
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,990
A BAG OF NUMBER TILES.

01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:28,536
YOU'LL THEN RACE BACK OVER A
SERIES OF OBSTACLES.

1265
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:32,498
YOU'LL THEN USE THOSE TILES TO
RELEASE THREE RINGS AND ATTEMPT

1266
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,000

1270

DAKAL, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA

1271
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:49,849
YOU'RE SITTING SOMEBODY OUT.

1272

WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?

1273
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,643
SANDRA GOING TO SIT OUT.

1274
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,020
>> SURPRISE.

1275

>> Jeff: TAKE A SPOT ON THE
SITOUT BENCH.

1276

LET'S DO IT.

HERE WE GO.

1290
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:31,516

SELE RUNS INTO THEIR FIRST
OBSTACLE.

1295
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:49,534
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR DAKAL,
WHO IS VERY CALM.

1296
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,911
>> GOOD JOB, DAKAL, GOOD JOB.

1297
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:52,328
>> RIGHT SIDE.

1298
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,747
RIGHT SIDE HARD.

1299
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:59,085
>> Jeff: DAKAL IS GOING TO GET
TO THEIR STATION FIRST.

1300
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:03,297
THEY'RE GOING TO BE UNTYING.

1301
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,258
SELE CAN'T GET TO THEIR STATION.

1302
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,634
THEY'RE CLOSE.

1303
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:10,429
BUT THEY'RE STILL TOO FAR.

1304
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,473
SARAH HAS THE NUMBER TILES FOR
DAKAL.

1305
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,099
THEY'RE HEADED BACK.

1306
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,436
DAKAL NOW WITH A NICE LEAD.

1307
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,980
ROB TRYING TO PULL THEM CLOSER.

1308

GOT THE START PADDLING AGAIN.

1316
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,465
DAKAL, YOU GOT A LOOSE END.

01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,133
YOU'RE GOOD.

1318
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,093
EVERYBODY OVER THE CRATES NOW.

1319

1324
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,110
>> Jeff: THERE GOES DAKAL.

1325
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:10,114
KIM IS IN THE WATER.

YOU'RE GOOD, SELE.

1327
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:15,036
START GETTING UP THOSE STEPS.

01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,162
DAKAL IS ALL IN.

01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:20,833
THEY'RE HEADING TO THE BARREL
ROLL.

1330
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:22,835
THERE GOES DENISE.

1331
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:24,462
THERE GOES DANNI.

THERE'S ADAM.

1333
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,135
DAKAL FIRST TO THE BARREL ROLL.

1334
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,179
YOU'VE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY
OVER.

1335
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:37,058
>> OKAY, PUSH ME OVER.

1336
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:39,143

1337
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:47,193

01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:53,157

01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,252
DAKAL STILL IN THE LEAD.

1344
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:12,343
IT IS VERY TOUGH TO GET PEOPLE
OVER THIS BARREL.

1345
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:18,599
SELE STRUGGLING AGAIN AS DAKAL
ONE PERSON AT A TIME, WOW, ROB

1350
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:36,617
DAKAL HAS EVERYBODY OVER.

1351
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:40,913

COME ON, GUYS, YOU GOT IT.

1354
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,251
WE MEAD THIS HEAD START.

1355
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,877
WE NEED IT.

1356
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,087
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

1357
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,257
>> Jeff: SELE DOWN TO FOUR
GUYS LEFT TRYING TO GET ADAM

1358
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:51,882
OVER.

1359
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,385
>> YOU'RE LOOKING FABULOUS.

1360
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:57,930
THEY'RE STILL SPINNING.

1361
01:06:58,013 --> 01:06:59,306
HEY, TONY, PAY ATTENTION.

1362
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,100
LET'S GO.

1363
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,477
EYES OVER HERE.

1364
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,230
>> Jeff: DAKAL WORKING ON
THEIR COMBINATION.

1365
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:07,773
>> THEY'RE STUCK ON THE WHEEL.

1366
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:08,232
LET'S GO.

1367
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:09,108
WE NEED THIS LEAD.

1368
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,943
>> Jeff: THERE ARE THREE SETS
OF NUMBERS.

1369
01:07:11,026 --> 01:07:15,072
ONCE YOU FREE THOSE RINGS, YOU
CAN START TOSSING.

1370
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,282
>> GET ON MY SHOULDERS, READY?

1371
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:20,286
>> Jeff: ROB AND JEREMY THE
LAST TWO.

1372
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,787
JEREMY TRYING.

1373
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,290
HE CAN'T DO IT.

1374
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:28,753
JEREMY GETTING ON THE SHOULDERS
OF ROB, WHO HAS BEEN A WORKHORSE

1375
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,504
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

1376
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:33,966
HE HAS EITHER LIFTED OR
SUPPORTED EVERYBODY.

1377
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:36,135
YUL WORKING ON THE COMBINATION.

1378
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,095
NO, GOT THE TRY ANOTHER.

1379
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:44,143
>> COME ON, COME ON.

>> Jeff: BEN GOING TO HOIST
ETHAN ON HIS BACK IS JEREMY CAN

1381
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,524
REACH.

1382
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,651
GREAT TEAMWORK BY SELE.

1383
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,194
WOW.

1384
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,947
THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT.

1385
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:57,907
>> PULL ME!

1386
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,657
PULL ME!

1387
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,327
PULL ME!

1388
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,162
>> Jeff: SELE HAS EVERYBODY
ACROSS.

1389
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:06,123
LET'S GO.

1390
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,459
YUL STILL WORKING ON THE
COMBINATION.

1391
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,127
AND HE'S GOT IT.

1392
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:15,049
DAKAL HAS THEIR RINGS FREE.

1393
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:20,346
IT'S GOING TO BE TIE ISN'T AN
WENDELL TOSSING RINGS FOR DAKAL.

1394
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,347
SELE TRYING TO GET BACK.

1395
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,348
THEY'RE EXHAUSTED.

1396
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,684
THEY STILL HAVE TO SOLVE THEIR
COMBINATION LOCK.

1397
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,852
YOU'RE GOOD, SELE.

1398
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,980
START SOLVING.

1399
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,025
TYSON GOING TO SWITCH OUT AND
GIVE IT TO WENDELL.

1400
01:08:33,108 --> 01:08:33,859
>> YES!

1401
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,320
>> Jeff: WENDELL HAS THE FIRST
PADDLE.

1402
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:38,864
NOW ADAM TRYING THE SOLVE THAT
COMBINATION.

1403
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,326
EVERY PART OF ADAM'S BODY IS
TWITCHING TRYING TO FIGURE THIS

1404
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:47,373
COMBO OUT OUT AND GIVE DAK DOING
A CHANCE TO REALLY GET IN ON

1405
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:47,748
THIS.

1406
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,376
JUST MISSES.

1407
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:54,088
TWO LEFT FOR DAKAL AS ADAM
CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE ON THE

1408
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,798
COMBINATION.

1409
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:56,298
HE'S GOT IT.

1410
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,050
THE RINGS ARE FREE.

1411
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,554
IT'S GOING TO BE BEN AND JEREMY
TOSSING THE RINGS FOR SELE.

1412
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,974
THEY HAVE SOME WORK TO DO.

1413
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:08,435
JEREMY STICKS THE FIRST ONE AND
WE ARE TIED JUST LIKE THAT, 1-1.

1414
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:12,273
THIS IS WHY YOU ALWAYS DIG IN
EVERY CHALLENGE EVERY STEP OF

1415
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:12,857
THE WAY.

1416
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:17,903
YOU ARE NEVER OUT OF IT.

1417
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,238
AND JEREMY DOES IT.

1418
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,698
SELE HAS THEIR SECOND RING.

1419
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:21,407
ONE RING LEFT.

1420
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,533
>> COME ON, JEREMY.

1421
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:25,077
>> Jeff: WENDELL TO TIE IT UP.

1422
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,246
IT'S ON AN OFF AGAIN FOR
WENDELL.

1423
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,373
>> YOU GOT THIS, JEREMY.

1424
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,292
>> Jeff: JEREMY FOR THE WIN.

1425
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:32,376
AND HE DOES IT!

1426
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:39,091
SELE WINS IMMUNITY, SENDING
DAKAL TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1427
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:39,550
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

1428
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:41,385
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

1429
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:42,428
GOOD JOB.

1430
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,470
YOU GUYS GAVE IT ALL.

1431
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:48,058
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

1432
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,268
>> Jeff: SELE, NICE JOB.

1433
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:54,064
NOBODY WANTS TO GO TO TRIBAL
BACK-TO-BACK.

1434
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,149
>> GET THAT.

1435
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,275
>> YEAH, BABY.

1436
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,445
>> Jeff: SELE, SAFE FROM
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1437
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,614
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR
TRIBE.

1438
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,115
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT.

1439
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:06,493
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

1440
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:09,914
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1441
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:11,081
DAKAL.

1442
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,834
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, AND SEE YOU TONIGHT AT

1443
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:17,838
TRIBAL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE
THE SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1444
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,131
"SURVIVOR: WINNERS AT WAR."

1445
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,008
>> WINNING THE CHALLENGE, IT'S A
GREAT MOMENT, BUT IN THE BACK OF

1446
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:25,012
MY HEAD I'M WORRIED ABOUT HAVING
MY WIFE ON THE OTHER TRIBE.

1447
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:28,557
AMBER HAS A HUGE TARGET ON HER
BECAUSE OF ME.

1448
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,727
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP HER.

1449
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:37,024
SO IN THIS MOMENT, THIS IS
POSSIBLY MY WHIFF'S LIFE IN THIS

1450
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:39,151
GAME.

1451
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,002
>> STUPID QUESTION, ANYONE WANT
TO KEEP NATTILY COMPANY,

1452
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:57,503
VOLUNTEER FOR THAT?

1453
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:58,337
>> DO YOU?

1454
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,838
>> HELL NO.

1455
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,800
>> I HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN 13
YEARS, WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

1456
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,009
WE GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL?

1457
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:09,014
ANYONE WANTS TO TALK TO ANYBODY
SHOULD JUST BE CIVILIZED ABOUT

1458
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,892
IT
>> THAT WOULD BE A FIRST.

1459
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,894
>> WHERE ARE YOU GUYS AT?

1460
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,396
>> SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

1461
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:17,189
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

1462
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,901
>> I WOULD RATHER GET OUT AMBER
>> I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE NICK

1463
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:21,944
OR SANDRA
>> I DO, TOO.

1464
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:25,030
>> AM I GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE
FOR SAYING PEOPLE?

1465
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:25,614
I THINK SANDRA OR NICK.

1466
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:26,532
>> THAT WILL START A WAR.

1467
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:29,034
>> SANDRA OR TONY?

1468
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:29,493
I DON'T KNOW.

1469
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:30,995
>> TONY OR SANDRA.

1470
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,204
WE GOT TO DECIDE.

1471
01:11:32,287 --> 01:11:34,540
>> EVERYBODY IS RUNNING AROUND
LIKE A CHICKEN WITH ITS HEAD CUT

1472
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,749
OFF.

1473
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,876
THE FIRST TRIBAL IS WHERE THINGS
ARE REVEALED, WHO IS WORKING

1474
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,419
WITH WHO.

1475
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:39,378
>> I'M WITH YOU GUYS.

1476
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,504
I WANT THE PLAY WITH YOU GUYS.

1477
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:47,344
>> YOU KNOW, I FEEL TOTALLY
SOLID WITH KIM OR TYSON.

1478
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:48,512
BUT OTHERWISE I'M LOVES.

1479
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:51,932
I'M NOT USED TO THIS STYLE OF
PLAY, BUT I BETTER DIVE IN.

1480
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:56,729
>> THE SMARTER MOVE IS AMBER FOR
HER TIE, BUT I WEAVE TYSON IS A

1481
01:11:56,812 --> 01:12:00,232
HUGE THREAT
>> I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS MUCH

1482
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:00,691
SCRAMBLING.

1483
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:01,233
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

1484
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,276
>> THIS FEELS DIFFERENT.

1485
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:05,904
>> THIS SEASON EVERY SINGLE
PERSON IS A THREAT.

1486
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:10,576
SO EVERYBODY IS RUNNING AROUND
TRYING TO MAKE AS MANY PLANS AS

1487
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:11,160
POSSIBLE.

1488
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:12,077
>> EVERYBODY DITCHED ME.

1489
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,205
>> AND THE FAR GET IS CONSTANTLY
SHIFTING.

1490
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:19,251
>> WENDELL, NICK, TONY, SANDRA,
THE WHOLE CREW.

1491
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,254
>> EVERYBODY IS SO OUT FOR
BLOOD, I THINK SOME OF THESE

1492
01:12:22,337 --> 01:12:25,049
PEOPLE THINK IT'S A REWARD TO
GET TO GO TO TRIBAL, BECAUSE

1493
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:26,300
THEY GET TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT.

1494
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:30,888
>> ARE WE CRAZY NOT TO GET
SANDRA OUT FIRST.

1495
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:33,724
>> WHEN NAMES ARE THROWN OUT,
SHE'S THE PERSON WHO GOES TO

1496
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:36,935
THAT PERSON AND SAYS, YOUR NAME
HAS BEEN THROWN OUT.

1497
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,439
>> THEY'LL GET RID OF YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE SHADY.

1498
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,650
>> I'M GOING TO SPREAD TRUTH,
LIES AND RUMORS.

1499
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,486
IT WORKS FOR ME, AND I CAN
AFFORD TO DO THIS, BECAUSE WHEN

1500
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:50,282
WE GOT BACK TO CAMP FROM THE
CHALLENGE, I REACH IN MY BAG,

1501
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:56,789
AND I FIND THIS LITTLE BABY.

1502
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:01,460
MY FIRST IMMUNITY IDOL ON
WINNERS AT WAR.

1503
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,128
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1504
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,423
IT IS GOOD FOR YOUR NEXT THREE
TRIBAL COUNCILS, BUT IT WILL

1505
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:07,508
COST YOU ONE FIRE TOKEN.

1506
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,717
THERE'S NOTHING TO THINK ABOUT.

1507
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:13,680
I'M BUYING THIS HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL WITH MY ONE FIRE TOKEN.

1508
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:14,848
REGARDLESS.

1509
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,601
NOW I'M STARTING TO REALIZE THE
EXTREME IMPORTANCE OF FIRE

1510
01:13:17,684 --> 01:13:20,020
TOKENS, AND I'M MAKING THE DEAL.

1511
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:23,023
I WANT TO THINK THAT NATALIE
MIGHT HAVE SENT IT TO ME SOMEHOW

1512
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,275
FROM THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

1513
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:29,154
I'M NOT SURE, BUT I'M SO
RELIEVED THAT I HAVE THIS.

1514
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,657
IF I GET A BAD FEELING ON THE
PIT OF MY STOMACH, I'M GOING TO

1515
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:36,662
PLAY THIS IDOL, BECAUSE THERE'S
A LOT OF NAMES THROWN OUT THERE.

1516
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:39,331
>> THEY'RE OKAY WITH TONY GOING
TONIGHT.

1517
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:43,293
>> DISCUSSIONS ARE CONSTANTLY
BEING HAD, AND EVERYTHING IS IN

1518
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,003
FLUX.

1519
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,213
>> NOW IT'S YOU.

1520
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:46,672
>> WHAT?

1521
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,215
>> NOW IT'S ME.

1522
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:50,801
TYSON JUST SAID --
>> TYSON WANTS TO VOTE ME OUT.

1523
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:52,511
COME ON, MAN, REALLY?

1524
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,554
LET'S GO.

1525
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:56,682
THEY SEE ME CALM AND COOL AND
LAID DOWN AND RELAXED.

1526
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,892
WHEN I KNOW IT'S GAME ON, I GO
STRAIGHT TO TEN.

1527
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:02,354
>> WE'RE GOING TO TELL TYSON NO
VOTE FOR AMBER TO SPLIT THAT

1528
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,647
VOTE.

1529
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,358
WE'LL TELL EVERYBODY WE'RE GOING
FOR AMBER, BUT WE'RE ALL VOTING

1530
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:06,942
FOR TYSON.

1531
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:07,693
>> WE'RE VOTING OUT TYSON.

1532
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:11,321
>> HE WILL GET SO BLIND SIDED.

1533
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:11,780
TYSON IS VERY POWERFUL AND
DANGEROUS.

1534
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,032
HE'S A FUNNY GUY.

1535
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,242
PEOPLE LOVE HIM.

1536
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:19,872
>> DOES ANYONE WANT THE MARVEL
AT THE SPLENDOR WHEN WE SAY OUR

1537
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,039
PRAYERS?

1538
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:24,835
ALSO BE SURE TO INCLUDE ME,
BECAUSE THANKING ME FOR HOW

1539
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:27,004
DELICIOUS THIS RICE WILL
PROBABLY BE.

1540
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,755
[LAUGHTER]
>> WE GOT TO BREAK UP THE POKER

1541
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:29,923
LINES.

1542
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,551
TYSON, AMBER, KIM, AND I WANT TO
GET TYSON OUT OF THE GAME.

1543
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,345
AMBER IS NOT RUNNING AROUND
DOING ANYTHING.

1544
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:38,015
PLUS YOU LEAVE THE BIGGEST
TARGET, HUSBAND AND WIFE, IN THE

1545
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:39,892
GAME STILL AS BIG SHIELDS.

1546
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,518
SO TYSON GOES HOME.

1547
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:42,728
>> HOW YOU DOING?

1548
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,897
>> ALL RIGHT.

1549
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,608
>> MY THOUGHTS ARE I THINK
BASICALLY THE SINGLE BIGGEST

1550
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:51,445
FEAR THAT EVERYONE HAS IN THE
GAME IS THAT ROB AND AMBER AND

1551
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:52,779
THIS WHOLE POKER ALLIANCE ARE
GOING TO DOMINATE.

1552
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:57,576
THAT'S THE THING THAT SEEMS TO
BE GALVANIZING EVERYONE.

1553
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,494
>> I HAVE YOUR BACK 100%.

1554
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:00,537
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1555
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,789
>> THE POKER ALLIANCE IS COMING
BACK THE BITE ME.

1556
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,750
THE SECOND I REALIZE THAT THINGS
WEREN'T GOING THE DIRECTION I

1557
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:08,795
WANTED THEM TO, MY STRATEGY
SWITCHED FROM DICTATING THE

1558
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:11,798
DIRECTION OF THE GAME TO PURE
SURVIVAL MODE.

1559
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:15,302
>> MAYBE AMBER AND KIM OR --
>> THEY'RE SUPER CLOSE.

1560
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:17,763
>> BREAK THEM UP ONE WAY OR THE
OTHER, BUT I'M WITH YOU GUYS, IF

1561
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,723
YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS THE WAY
WE'RE GOING.

1562
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:20,849
>> COOL.

1563
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:25,646
>> I DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO
BUT INTO THEIR WARM POKEY

1564
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,272
POISONOUS EMBRACE.

1565
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,775
I FEEL BAD FOR KIM AND AMBER,
BUT IT'S WORTH IT TO ME TO

1566
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:34,446
FORFEIT THIS BATTLE TO HOPEFULLY
WIN THE WAR.

1567
01:15:34,529 --> 01:15:38,450
>> DO YOU GUYS HAVE SOMEONE IN
MIND?

1568
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:39,076
>> IT'S ME.

1569
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,078
>> DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE?

1570
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:44,998
>> NEW YORK BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S
ME.

1571
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:45,958
>> THAT'S FUNNY.

1572
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,459
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY IT?

1573
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:48,835
>> I'M NOT SAYING NOTHING.

1574
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:52,422
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M GETTING A
VERY BAD VIBE FROM EVERYONE.

1575
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,467
I KNOW THAT I AM NOT SOMEONE
THAT PEOPLE WANT IN THEIR

1576
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:56,635
CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW.

1577
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:59,429
THERE'S MOMENTS OF PARANOIA
WHERE LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING

1578
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:06,770
AND I WALK UP AND IT STOPS.

1579
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:09,815
THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND
THEY DON'T WANT ME TO KNOW ABOUT

1580
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:10,399
IT.

1581
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,694
GOD, IT'S JUST AWKWARD.

1582
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,988
>> DO YOU WANT...

1583
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,656
>> SO... WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

1584
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:18,573
NOBODY WILL TALK.

1585
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,159
I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THIS
POSITION BEFORE.

1586
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:26,957
MY SEASON I WAS MAKING THE CALLS
EVERY SINGLE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1587
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:27,874
>> COME ON.

1588
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:28,792
YOU CAN TELL ME.

1589
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,837
PLEASE TRUST ME.

1590
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,338
>> THIS IS SUCH A BAD FEELING.

1591
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,506
>> GIVE ME A HUG.

1592
01:16:34,589 --> 01:16:36,967
>> I DON'T THINK I REALLY
UNDERSTOOD TODAY WHAT IT FEELS

1593
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:42,514
LIKE TO BE ON THE OUTS.

1594
01:16:42,597 --> 01:16:44,850
THIS IS NOT THE WAY I ENVISIONED
MY COMEBACK.

1595
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:48,186
I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON IS I
THINK TIE ISN'T AND AMBER AND I

1596
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,148
ARE IN TROUBLE FOR THE SAME
REASON, AND I THINK IN THIS CASE

1597
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:52,983
THE POKER ALLIANCE HAS BECOME
WHAT THAT IS.

1598
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:55,861
>> TYSON SAYS HE'S GOING TO VOTE
AGAINST AMBER OR KIM.

1599
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,738
>> HE'S NOT WITH US.

1600
01:16:57,821 --> 01:16:59,448
>> HE'S ACTING, MAN.

1601
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,074
HE'S ACTING.

1602
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,034
WE'LL SEE TONIGHT.

1603
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,494
>> ONE OF THE THREE OF US ARE
BEING VOTED OUT.

1604
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,579
THAT'S JUST IT.

1605
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:07,372
I THINK THERE'S REALLY NOTHING I
CAN DO TO CHANGE THAT.

1606
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,916
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A LARGE
GROUP OF PEOPLE VOTING TOGETHER.

1607
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,922
TO START THIS GAME THE WAY I DID
HONESTLY, IT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST

1608
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,050
MESS.

1609
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:39,863
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH GO.

1610
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:43,283
AHEAD HEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.

1611
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:43,909
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

1612
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:53,835
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

1613
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:58,924
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

1614
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:03,595
AMBER, YOU FIRST PLAYED 20 YEARS
AGO, BUT THE LAST TIME YOU

1615
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,639
PLAYED WAS 16 YEARS AGO.

1616
01:18:05,722 --> 01:18:08,725
KIDS THAT WERE BORN THE LAST
TIME YOU PLAYED ARE NOW DRIVING

1617
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,268
CARS.

1618
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:14,439
HOW ARE YOU FEELING WITH THE
GAME GIVEN ITSELF FULL-ON?

1619
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,900
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I LOOK
EXACTLY THE SAME, I HAVEN'T AGED

1620
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,276
A BIT.

1621
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,569
>> Jeff: 100%.

1622
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,988
>> THAT FEELING OF BEING ON EDGE
IS DEFINITELY FAMILIAR, HOWEVER,

1623
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:24,533
IT WAS HAPPENING MUCH QUICKER
THAN WHAT I'M USED.

1624
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:28,328
TO I FEEL LIKE IF I'M NOT ON MY
TOES MOVING AT ALL TIME, I'M

1625
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:29,538
BEHIND.

1626
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:32,457
>> Jeff: TYSON, WHEN THE GAME
MOVES AS FAST AS IT MOVES NOW,

1627
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,502
CAN YOU SEE A TASTE OF DIFFERENT
ERAS?

1628
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:36,628
>> YEAH, FOR SURE.

1629
01:18:36,711 --> 01:18:40,799
I THINK THE OLDER ERA,
ESPECIALLY LIKE YUL, HE KIND OF

1630
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,592
OBSERVES BEFORE HE ACTS.

1631
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,929
SOME OF THE NEWER PLAYERS
IMMEDIATELY ACT.

1632
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:46,930
>> Jeff: TONY, IS HE TALKING
ABOUT YOU?

1633
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:51,101
>> I HOPE NOT.

1634
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:53,478
I'M NICE AND SLOW, MAN.

1635
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:57,149
I'M STEALING A PAGE OUT OF HER
BOOK TODAY.

1636
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:00,986
>> Jeff: AMBER YOU DON'T SEEM
TO AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT TONY

1637
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,613
WAS SLOW
>> NOT AT ALL.

1638
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:04,823
HE WAS RUNNING AROUND FROM
PERSON TO PERSON TODAY.

1639
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,825
IT WAS QUITE NERVE RACKING.

1640
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,160
>> WEREN'T YOU?

1641
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:08,618
WASN'T EVERYBODY?

1642
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:09,369
I CAME THE PLAY.

1643
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:10,996
THE FIRST TWO DAYS I DIDN'T
NEED.

1644
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:11,830
TO WE WON.

1645
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:12,998
TODAY I NEEDED TO TALK ABOUT
SURVIVAL.

1646
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:17,878
>> Jeff: SO TODAY YOU WERE
SPAR, GETTING READY, AND YOU

1647
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:19,671
THINK SHE THINKS THAT'S CRAZY?

1648
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,841
>> EXACTLY MY POINT
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S CRAZY.

1649
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,051
I'M MORE COOL, CALM, AND
COLLECTED

1650
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,345
>> AMBER HASN'T BEEN AROUND FOR
A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.

1651
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,014
YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH THE
PACE OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

1652
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:31,850
MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.

1653
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,018
THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS.

1654
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,688
>> Jeff: SO SOPHIE, WHAT WAS
THE FEELING AS YOU GUYS STARTED

1655
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:39,483
TO GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO
TRIBAL.

1656
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:42,819
WAS IT GOING LIKE THIS, OR DID
IT REACH A FLOW AND WE GOT A

1657
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:43,695
PLAN?

1658
01:19:43,778 --> 01:19:45,697
>> NEW YORK I'D SAY THE DAY WENT
LIKE THAT.

1659
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,324
AND IT TOTALLY DROPPED OFF.

1660
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,993
BUT IT WAS SCARY BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T KNOW, DID I HAVE THE

1661
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:52,037
RIGHT LAST CONVERSATION, BUT
SOMEBODY HERE DID NOT.

1662
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,998
>> Jeff: SANDRA, WHAT DID YOU
SEE HAPPENING TODAY?

1663
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:58,710
>> THERE WAS PANIC, BECAUSE
THERE WERE SEVERAL NAMES THROWN

1664
01:19:58,793 --> 01:19:59,878
OUT.

1665
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:03,089
BUT THEN THE NAMES WERE NARROWED
DOWN TO A VERY SMALL GROUP.

1666
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:05,926
>> Jeff: KIM, YOU'RE NODDING
>> YEAH, I'M THE SMALL GROUP

1667
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:10,138
THAT IT GOT WHITTLED DOWN TO.

1668
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,349
>> Jeff: HOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR
NAME GOT BROUGHT UP

1669
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:13,099
>> GOSH, IT'S A LONG STORY.

1670
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:16,186
>> Jeff: GIVE ME THE SHORT
VERSION.

1671
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:17,103
GIVE ME THE HEADLINE.

1672
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:20,065
>> THE HEADLINE IS: POKER PLAYER
ALLIANCE.

1673
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,233
WHICH DOESN'T EXIST.

1674
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,735
I PLAYED IN A POKER GAME AIER
AGO OUTSIDE OF THE GAME, WHICH

1675
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:26,029
IS GOING TO TURN OUT TO COME
BACK AND BITE ME

1676
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,114
>> TYSON, DID YOU HEAR YOUR NAME
LIKE KIM?

1677
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:28,949
>> FOR SURE.

1678
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:30,158
I HEARD MY NAME.

1679
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:33,912
I HAVE TO HOPE THAT WHAT I DID
WAS ENOUGH TO PROVE TO PEOPLE

1680
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:35,956
THAT I'M HERE TO BE WITH THEM.

1681
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,124
>> BUT HE'S PART OF THAT POKER
CREW, TOO.

1682
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:41,586
>> THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING TO
ME.

1683
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,089
THERE ARE SO MANY CLOSE
RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE SO MUCH

1684
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:47,884
CLOSER THAN THE POKER PLAYER
ALLIANCE THAT MET FOR THREE

1685
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:48,677
HOURS.

1686
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,928
POKER PLAYER ALLIANCE IS NOT A
THING.

1687
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:50,512
IT'S IN THE A THING.

1688
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:52,222
IF IT IS, I'M NOT IN IT.

1689
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:56,059
>> Jeff: WENDELL, IT'S AN
INTERESTING LAYER.

1690
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:59,479
"SURVIVOR" HAS BEEN AROUND SO
LONG THAT SOME OF YOU GUYS HAVE

1691
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:00,772
GENUINELY BECOME FRIENDS.

1692
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:04,734
>> YEAH, IF THERE WAS A DIAGRAM,
IT WOULD BE ALL OVER THE PLACE,

1693
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:05,986
BECAUSE THERE ARE THESE FOUR
PEOPLE FROM HERE AND THESE TWO

1694
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:09,447
PEOPLE MET HERE AND THESE PEOPLE
PLAYED ON THIS SEASON AND THAT

1695
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:10,532
SEASON.

1696
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,325
SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW TIGHT
PEOPLE THAT PLAYED POKER ONE

1697
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,327
TIME A YEAR AGO WOULD BE.

1698
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,413
>> NOT CLOSE.

1699
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:20,250
>> NOT CLOSE ACCORDING TO KIM,
NOT CLOSE, BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE

1700
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:21,334
THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.

1701
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,963
>> BUT WHEN $2 MILLION IS AT
STAKE, I THINK FRIENDS ARE

1702
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:28,133
NOT -- WE'RE WILLING TO DO
ANYTHING.

1703
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:29,134
>> Jeff: WOW.

1704
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:32,137
NICK, DOES THE CANDOR FROM AMBER
SURPRISE YOU?

1705
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,765
JUST FLAT OUT SAILING, IT'S $2
MILLION, LET'S DON'T PRETEND.

1706
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:36,808
WE'LL KILL EACH OTHER.

1707
01:21:36,891 --> 01:21:38,435
>> YEAH, THAT DOES SURPRISE ME.

1708
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:39,561
BUT I UNDERSTAND.

1709
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:41,980
I MEAN, ONCE THEY HEARD $2
MILLION, THEY STARTED THINKING

1710
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:45,150
ABOUT PUTTING THAT CHECK IN
THEIR OWN POCKET, NOT THEIR

1711
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,485
FRIEND'S POCKET AND NOT ANYBODY
ELSE'S POCKET.

1712
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,322
>> Jeff: SOPHIE, YOU'RE
NODDING.

1713
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,324
>> I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE MONEY.

1714
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,034
>> IT'S $2 MILLION, JEFF.

1715
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:58,705
I MEAN, THAT IN ITSELF WILL
CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO JUST DO

1716
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:02,500
ANYTHING, AND IF FRIENDS HAVE TO
BE LOST ALONG THE WAY, THEN I

1717
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,170
THINK IT'S A PRICE EVERY SINGLE
PERSON OUT HERE WILL BE WILLING

1718
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:10,133
TO PAY.

1719
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:12,177
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1720
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,637
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1721
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:20,769
NICK, YOU'RE UP.

1722
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:59,265
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1723
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:02,560
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1724
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:07,065
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1725
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:07,565
OKAY.

1726
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:12,237
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1727
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:19,744
FIRST VOTE, NICK.

1728
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:20,453
KIM.

1729
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,415
KIM.

1730
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,207
KIM.

1731
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:30,588
THREE VOTES KIM, ONE VOTE NICK.

1732
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,383
AMBER.

1733
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:33,800
AMBER.

1734
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:38,763
TWO VOTES AMBER.

1735
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,932
WE'RE TIED.

1736
01:23:41,015 --> 01:23:46,146
THAT'S THREE VOTES AMBER, THREE
VOTES KIM, ONE VOTE NICK.

1737
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:47,397
AMBER.

1738
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:53,862
THAT'S FOUR VOTES AMBER, THREE
VOTES KIM, AND THE SECOND PERSON

1739
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:55,113
VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR: WINNERS
AT WAR," AMBER.

1740
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,614
THAT'S FIVE.

1741
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:57,282
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1742
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:09,794
YOU NEED BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1743
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:15,592
AMBER, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1744
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:27,771
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1745
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:45,246
>> I HAVE ONE.

1746
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:52,754
>> I HAVE ONE.

1747
01:24:54,714 --> 01:24:57,717
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1748
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:00,678
"SURVIVOR" IS LOOKING FOR NEW
PLAYERS.

1749
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:01,304
IT COULD BE YOU.

1750
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:03,139
APPLY NOW.

1751
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:09,354
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," WHEN THE ENEMY

1752
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:09,854
STRIKES...

1753
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:10,688
>> IT COULD BE SANDRA.

1754
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,440
IF SHE VOTED MY WIFE OUT, THIS
IS WAR.

1755
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:16,027
>> Jeff: AND BLOWS UP YOUR
GAME.

1756
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:17,237
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1757
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,321
>> Jeff: YOU'LL NEED TO CLIMB
OUT OF THE RUBBLE.

1758
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:20,907
>> IT'S LIKE 20 FEET TALL.

1759
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,200
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE
FIRST.

1760
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:30,375
>> HOW IS THIS GUY STILL ALIVE?

1761
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,419
>> I BET YOU'RE HAPPY TO SEE ME.

1762
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:34,379
YOU'RE NOT ALONE ANYMORE.

1763
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:37,340
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE MY TRIBE WON.

1764
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:39,592
I WANTED THEM TO LOSE SO BAD.

1765
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:42,053
>> I KNEW I HAD A HUGE TARGET ON
MY BACK.

1766
01:25:42,136 --> 01:25:44,973
I PUT MY TRUST IN PEOPLE HOPING
FOR THE BEST, AND IT WASN'T THE

1767
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:46,516
BEST.
