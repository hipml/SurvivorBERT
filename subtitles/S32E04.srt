2
00:00:02,526 --> 00:00:04,958
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:09,178
Kaôh Rông provided 
the most violent conditions.

4
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:11,011
My poor, these sunburns!

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,519
Extreme temperatures brought 
dehydration and exhaustion...

6
00:00:14,644 --> 00:00:17,484
This heat could play 
a central role in this game.

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,562
...leading some to wonder 
how much more they can bear.

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,389
I am physically very weak there.

9
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:24,532
In the Beauty tribe,

10
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,161
the women found safety 
with each other.

11
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:28,789
Girls, we are very close.

12
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:30,663
But Tai found an idol.

13
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,181
And a friend in Caleb.

14
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,569
I was clearly aiming for the kiss!

15
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:37,971
In the Muscles tribe,

16
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:41,691
Alecia came across the clue 
leading to the idol.

17
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,892
If I find the idol, I lead the game.

18
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:47,461
But his luck ran out 
when Jason found the idol first.

19
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:48,648
Got it, Scott!

20
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:51,451
First I'm at the top, 
and then I'm back at the bottom.

21
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:53,461
At the last immunity test...

22
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,690
To the left !

23
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:56,456
...Muscles finally won.

24
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:58,892
Muscles succeeds,

25
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,180
sending Intelligence to the council!

26
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:02,328
On the camp...

27
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:03,830
We play like bosses.

28
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:07,275
...Peter and Liz were sure 
to control the Intelligence tribe.

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,003
I'm confident 
everything will work out as expected.

30
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,279
Well !

31
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,615
But Debbie was tired 
of following orders

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,735
and led a revolt 
against Liz and Peter.

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,010
It won't be pretty 
when we get home, kids!

34
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:23,580
At the council,

35
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,755
Debbie's plan worked, 
sending Liz home...

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,396
Liz, the tribe has spoken.

37
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,860
...leaving Peter alone, 
at the bottom of the ladder.

38
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:34,915
There are 15 left.

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,840
Who will be eliminated tonight?

40
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:53,678
Well, that was something!

41
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:00,020
This advice went 
exactly as I expected.

42
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:01,925
I gathered information,

43
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,299
I observed,

44
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,148
then set goals.

45
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:07,827
I knew how to reach them.

46
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:10,171
You could say I was the mastermind.

47
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,868
It was between her and you, 
but I didn't want it to be you.

48
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,774
I'm just gonna have to 
take a step back and relax.

49
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:21,917
Peter's position in the tribe

50
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,077
gave him a good blow to his ego.

51
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,247
He's totally narcissistic, 
but he knows

52
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:28,782
let it stay on the periphery.

53
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:32,126
I'm not disappointed, just shocked.

54
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,054
I thought I was leaving.

55
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:37,009
- Hang on. 
- Thanks. Thank you for coming.

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,668
The council tonight

57
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,635
was a complete surprise.

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,239
I'm still... 
my stomach is in knots.

59
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,533
We're the Debility tribe, 
not Intelligence.

60
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:47,796
We are doomed.

61
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:50,845
We no longer have a strong tribe, 
physically or strategically.

62
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:53,909
I'm sidelined, 
but happy to still be here.

63
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,209
And after the merger, 
or a mixture of teams,

64
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:57,744
I will eliminate them one by one.

65
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:00,013
I need a beer!

66
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,841
Over here, everyone!

67
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:23,436
We're really going to enjoy ourselves.

68
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:32,801
Beauty and Muscle Tribes,

69
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:35,557
discover 
the new Intelligence tribe.

70
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:38,357
Liz was eliminated 
at the last council.

71
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,769
I did not expect that.

72
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,925
Ready for 
today's reward event?

73
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:48,661
Today,

74
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:51,973
you will cross a series of obstacles 
until you reach a trunk

75
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,748
under which 
you will have to dig and pass.

76
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,637
You will then reach 
a sand pit

77
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:01,082
where you will have to dig up 
three bags of bullets.

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,489
When you have the balls,

79
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,990
you will attempt to roll them 
into targets.

80
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,176
The first two tribes to finish 
win a reward.

81
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:13,820
Want to know what's at stake?

82
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:15,830
For the first,

83
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,326
Coffee !

84
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:23,171
Cups, spices, coffee.

85
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,911
It will give a different flavor 
to everything on the camp.

86
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,744
For the second:

87
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,338
not as complete

88
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,481
but even salt and pepper

89
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,375
will make the coconut taste better.

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,043
For the latter:

91
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:38,169
nothing.

92
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:41,356
Beauty, you are two more, 
two will not participate.

93
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,850
Remember, it can't 
be the same two events in a row.

94
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:47,910
Who does not participate here, 
will participate in the immunity test.

95
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,764
Julia and Anna do not participate.

96
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,600
Intelligence, you are one more. 
Who will not participate?

97
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,162
Take a seat on the bench.

98
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:57,497
The others, a minute of organization 
and we get started.

99
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:10,276
Alright, here we go. 
For a reward.

100
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,019
Survivors, ready?

101
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:18,673
Under this first obstacle,

102
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,820
very hot sand.

103
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:25,258
We forget how quickly 
the sand heats up.

104
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:28,061
Above the next two 
are Beauty and Muscles

105
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:29,496
who go strong,

106
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,788
then Intelligence.

107
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,198
Forward, Intelligence!

108
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:33,873
Start digging!

109
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,144
Come on, it's good!

110
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:39,815
Intelligence must wait 
until all have passed.

111
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,375
Joe speeds up. 
Go ahead, Intelligence!

112
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:47,590
You have to dig 
and go under the trunk.

113
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,259
Wow, Cydney quickly passed 
for Muscles!

114
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,462
No one had ever 
passed so quickly!

115
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,100
Meet Debbie for Intelligence.

116
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:59,325
Like a turtle 
emerging from its egg!

117
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:03,719
This is Tai for Beauty.

118
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,800
Once passed, you can 
dig on the other side.

119
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:10,145
This is Aubry for Intelligence.

120
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,816
The biggest, Scot, has passed! 
Jason too!

121
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,142
Carry on, Muscles!

122
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:18,520
Muscles took the lead.

123
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,122
Dig up those bags now!

124
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,984
Intelligence has passed. 
Dig up your bags!

125
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,001
Beauty is now last.

126
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:30,832
Nick has a great body to push through.

127
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:34,336
Beauty is gone. 
Start digging!

128
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,164
You are looking for three bags of bullets.

129
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:40,274
You don't know where they are.

130
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,635
When you have them, 
you can continue.

131
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:46,329
Scot has the first Bag of Muscles.

132
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:48,174
I have a bag!

133
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:50,501
Beauty has her first bag.

134
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,121
One bag for Muscles, one for Beauty.

135
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:57,740
- They are there. One, then two. 
- Scot has a 2nd bag for Muscles.

136
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,232
Two for Muscles,

137
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,892
one for Intelligence and Beauty.

138
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:08,501
- I will die ! 
- Die.

139
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:10,964
Just looking at you 
is hard!

140
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,400
It's clearly not easy,

141
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:17,379
after nine days of the toughest game 
you will ever play.

142
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,404
Oh my God !

143
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,936
ELAPSED TIME: 45 Minutes

144
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,514
Who knew it would be so hard

145
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,565
to find three small bags 
in a pile of sand?

146
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,777
Complete exhaustion.

147
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:03,365
Muscles has had two bags 
for quite a while.

148
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,260
No way to find the third.

149
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,596
One for Intelligence, one for Beauty.

150
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,466
Debbie has a second bag 
for Intelligence!

151
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:12,992
It's good, it's good!

152
00:08:13,962 --> 00:08:14,963
Go on !

153
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,439
And suddenly, 
Intelligence has its third bag!

154
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,507
Come on, get those bullets out!

155
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,738
Huge advance for Intelligence.

156
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:23,970
The two tribes

157
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:26,139
digging in the sand, 
are exhausted.

158
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:28,775
Good, Aubry!

159
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,711
Aubry throws the balls 
for Intelligence.

160
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:34,814
You have to place the six balls 
in the targets.

161
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:39,352
Aubry scores a first point 
for Intelligence.

162
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:43,298
Second point for Intelligence.

163
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,561
But dig. Dig.

164
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:51,406
Considerable advance 
for intelligence.

165
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:55,605
Peter takes over 
for Intelligence.

166
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,871
He scores. 
Three points for Intelligence.

167
00:08:58,657 --> 00:08:59,939
The exhaustion shows.

168
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:01,574
Hold on, Caleb.

169
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:03,685
- To fart ! 
- Come on, Peter, it's good!

170
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:06,579
Fourth point for Peter.

171
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,350
- With the feet, it's easier. 
- I'm digging here.

172
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:13,653
Intelligence placed 4 out of 6 balls. 
Debbie steps forward.

173
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,431
It's a fix, at this point.

174
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,334
Debbie scores a fifth point 
for Intelligence.

175
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,391
More than a bullet for Intelligence.

176
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:23,428
Peter takes over 
for Intelligence.

177
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:26,366
- More than one! Can it get there? 
- Come on, Peter! Get us this!

178
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,582
Peter scores the sixth 
and final point for Intelligence!

179
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:37,555
What a correction, 
the other tribes are far behind!

180
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,544
Big reward for Intelligence.

181
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,963
Now 
it's for second place.

182
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:44,775
Muscles and Beauty.

183
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:48,488
This race has been going on 
for a long time.

184
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,165
Keep digging!

185
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:51,832
Yeah, my hen!

186
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:54,461
Caleb has found Beauty a second bag .

187
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,081
Got it, got it!

188
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:58,506
And suddenly, Nick has the third bag!

189
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,900
Beauty has her three bags. 
Start throwing!

190
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,198
Everyone is well ?

191
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:07,983
I burn inside.

192
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,509
This is Caleb.

193
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:13,646
First ball for Beauty.

194
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:18,200
- Shall I call the doctor? 
- Nope.

195
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:20,249
- I'll call him. 
- No do not do that.

196
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:23,656
Deb, you're gonna push too hard 
and get heatstroke.

197
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,094
Second ball for Beauty.

198
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,799
She's got heat stroke, I think.

199
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:36,136
She weighs only 45 pounds.

200
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,856
- How are you feeling, Deb? 
- It's heat stroke.

201
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:40,982
Doctor !

202
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,442
Over here, go!

203
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:47,013
Oh my God !

204
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:49,391
- Stay calm. 
- Oh, Lord!

205
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:52,494
- How are you ? 
- I have heatstroke.

206
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,985
- Stay calm. 
- Oh my God !

207
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,881
Sweet Jesus !

208
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,724
We'll refresh you, okay?

209
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:32,592
Here's some water for you.

210
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,971
We have three different stories 
at the same time!

211
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:37,731
Muscles always dig,

212
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,275
while Beauty 
tries to finish second

213
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,576
and the doctor takes care of Debbie.

214
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,801
Sweet Jesus !

215
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,757
Joe, tell me everything. 
What's going on ?

216
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:48,808
She is very hot at the moment, 
she is suffering from the heat.

217
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,513
Its temperature is high, 
we must lower it.

218
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:55,903
You pour cold water over it 
to lower its temperature.

219
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:58,747
That's right, we have to refresh it.

220
00:11:58,872 --> 00:11:59,873
OK.

221
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,230
Much better !

222
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,828
- Are you feeling okay, Debbie? 
- Yes sir !

223
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:07,742
In my Ranger training 
at Hawk Mountain,

224
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,441
I learned first aid.

225
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:12,766
Because of this, I knew I 
had heat stroke.

226
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,148
It's like being roasted alive.

227
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:18,482
We have the head which turns,

228
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:20,015
we are exhausted

229
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:22,004
and we are hot.

230
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:25,221
And after a few seconds 
of shade and water,

231
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,155
I 
immediately felt better.

232
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,315
I knew that I would not be evacuated.

233
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,237
- Debbie, are you feeling better? 
- Yes, much better.

234
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:33,806
You are in good hands.

235
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:37,781
Besides, you won the test. 
Relax, no pressure.

236
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:41,630
Let's see what happens 
with the other two tribes.

237
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:43,872
Keep it in the shade, Joe.

238
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,943
Beauty and Muscles

239
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,574
are vying for second place.

240
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:52,914
Beauty has placed five balls 
since the medical incident.

241
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,274
More than one.

242
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:56,941
Muscles is always looking for 
the third bag.

243
00:12:57,066 --> 00:13:00,113
The only thing they haven't done 
is give up.

244
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,257
Come on, teamwork!

245
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,657
Come on, we'll get there!

246
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,193
Keep cheering us on, 
it's what you do best.

247
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,196
What matters 
is being a team.

248
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,171
I had two bags. And you?

249
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,092
We had to dig more than 30 cm!

250
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:14,627
Dig. Shut up and dig, 
please.

251
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:18,139
I don't want to be rude, 
just that we find him.

252
00:13:20,044 --> 00:13:23,988
Beauty revolves around the 6th target 
without managing to conclude.

253
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,705
Caleb is going to give it a shot.

254
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,905
Got it, got it!

255
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,187
And suddenly, Jason 
has the third bag for Muscles!

256
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,513
Forward, Muscles!

257
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,372
You are back in the race!

258
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:36,449
Go-y, Caleb!

259
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:38,702
Caleb is under pressure now.

260
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:40,642
Beauty has 5 out of 6 bullets.

261
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,898
Only one is missing, 
can he make it?

262
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,024
Failed again!

263
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,335
It's a carnival game, 
you can win in an instant!

264
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:50,130
Jason comes forward for Muscles.

265
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:52,952
You can throw as many balls 
as you want at once.

266
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:55,143
Jason throws as fast as he can.

267
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,580
A first for Jason.

268
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,345
Caleb can win now!

269
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:03,687
Scott takes over.

270
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,040
Scot places a second ball 
for Muscles.

271
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:13,228
Scot places a third ball 
for Muscles.

272
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,172
There are now 5 - 3, 
Muscles goes up!

273
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:19,699
Is it good ?

274
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:21,913
Yes ! Beauty wins!

275
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:24,330
The 2nd place award 
is for Beauty!

276
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:26,332
Reward for Intelligence,

277
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:28,562
nothing for Muscles,

278
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:32,375
otherwise an empty and lonely afternoon 
on camp.

279
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:35,064
Oh, my God, friends!

280
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,155
Come, sweetie.

281
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,708
I can not move.

282
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:46,252
Joe, where are we? 
How is she ?

283
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:48,887
She is doing much better. 
Already, she is no longer so hot.

284
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:51,601
Jeff! I have the banana. 
Cool.

285
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:52,727
Good.

286
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,438
His heart rate is quite high.

287
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,831
We managed 
to lower his temperature.

288
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:00,186
Caleb, water?

289
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:06,112
Whore.

290
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,188
They know how hot it is. 
They fight.

291
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,157
But they cannot land 
to regain strength.

292
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,624
With the efforts they provide, 
with this heat,

293
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:21,541
the body has difficulty maintaining 
a normal temperature.

294
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,689
Doctor ?

295
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:24,557
I would like to keep an eye...

296
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,192
Yes, he needs the doctor.

297
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:28,570
Doctor ! 
Go see Caleb too!

298
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,958
Warning warning ! 
Get away, get away!

299
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:37,470
Tai, step aside, please.

300
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:40,806
Water is coming, okay?

301
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:44,429
Come on, we need some water! 
Water, water!

302
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:47,180
It's okay, Caleb. 
We are here. The doctor is there.

303
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:48,915
Come on, pour it on him!

304
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:53,953
We are here with you, my friend. 
You are in very good hands.

305
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:56,734
Inhale deeply.

306
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,149
Deep, okay?

307
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,001
You have to move forward.

308
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:14,149
We need something to fan him, 
anything.

309
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:18,220
Bring the reflector, 
and someone fan it with it!

310
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:26,619
Tell me everything, Joe.

311
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:29,667
Caleb has heat stroke.

312
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,225
He has 
a hard time withstanding the temperature.

313
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:33,860
Stay calm.

314
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:35,437
Breathe regularly.

315
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,973
Stay with us, champ!

316
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,170
How do you feel ?

317
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,574
Cydney, you'll be fine, do 
n't worry.

318
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:48,369
Breathe deeply.

319
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,873
The whole medical team is here, 
okay?

320
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:52,533
It'll be fine, Cydney.

321
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:58,156
Hey, everyone on the team 
needs to get involved!

322
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,912
I continue this.

323
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:03,465
Umbrellas, coolers, water! 
Make yourself useful!

324
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:05,901
- Thank you sir. 
- You're welcome.

325
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:08,620
Caleb, I'm going to put a mask on you.

326
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:10,345
You will breathe better.

327
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:14,000
Continue with the water on both sides, 
continue to refresh them.

328
00:17:14,423 --> 00:17:15,988
Well, be still, my friend.

329
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,071
Caleb? 
You're still with us, huh?

330
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,930
You are in good hands, 
my friend.

331
00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:24,686
Caleb, can you hear me?

332
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,087
Caleb, can you hear me?

333
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:27,914
Caleb, are you with us?

334
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,184
Caleb, are you with us?

335
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:36,177
-Caleb? 
- Oh my God !

336
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:47,142
Caleb, how are you? 
Caleb, are you with us?

337
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,268
More ice cream!

338
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:49,836
Alright, let's turn it off.

339
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:54,049
Caleb, can you hear me?

340
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,476
- Caleb, can you hear me? 
- Oh my God !

341
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,454
We're here with you, okay? 
Stay with us!

342
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:02,248
I see you nodding.

343
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,912
Take a deep breath, 
Caleb, okay?

344
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:06,361
You hear me ?

345
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:10,064
Bring me the saline, 
in the refrigerated box!

346
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,324
I go.

347
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,933
Keep showering Cydney.

348
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,920
Joe, you give him 
something to rehydrate, so what?

349
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:40,005
He is receiving cold fluid 
intravenously

350
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,570
to lower its temperature.

351
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,323
And it will help rehydrate him.

352
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:46,459
- And you monitor his temperature. 
- Yes.

353
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,473
Pass me the water, please. 
Thanks.

354
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:53,642
His pulse is 112, Joe.

355
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:56,411
Blood pressure 
below 46/94.

356
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,180
Monitor his vital signs 
and add ice.

357
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:02,379
- Cydney, can you hear me? 
- Yes.

358
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:03,793
Good. How are you ?

359
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:06,927
Jason takes good care of you.

360
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,425
The medical team is right there, 
taking care of Caleb.

361
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,853
We need a helicopter 
to evacuate him.

362
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,323
We will evacuate it!

363
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,625
Call the helicopter!

364
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:21,392
As fast as possible, the chopper!

365
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:23,697
Bring the big stretcher!

366
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:25,106
She's there !

367
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:28,151
Damn, they lost 
two people?

368
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:30,664
Cydney is down too.

369
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,511
Breathe slowly 
and deeply. OK ?

370
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:37,243
To get your breathing 
under control.

371
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:38,635
Stay calm.

372
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:41,476
Breathe.

373
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,326
So, Joe, where's Cydney?

374
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,942
She seems to be doing better. 
How are you feeling, Cydney?

375
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:48,449
How are you.

376
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,745
His temperature returned to normal.

377
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,935
But we have to keep watering it.

378
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,082
Everything will be fine, okay?

379
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,498
Cydney? 
Everything is fine now, okay?

380
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:02,335
You do not risk 
being removed from the game.

381
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:05,513
We are right next to it.

382
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:15,100
We have to leave shortly, Joe.

383
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,771
As you know, there are only 2 ways 
to leave the game without being eliminated:

384
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:24,573
by giving up, 
and this is clearly not the case,

385
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:27,569
or when the doctor 
is too worried about you

386
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,417
to let you continue.

387
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:31,573
You don't want to be checked out.

388
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,675
My friend, you have no choice.

389
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,633
It's the doctor's decision.

390
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:38,038
You gave it your all, 
with all your might.

391
00:20:38,163 --> 00:20:39,506
You pay dearly for it.

392
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,940
You won't go any further.

393
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:45,078
We have to take care of you.

394
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,323
You are a warrior. 
I'm glad you're here.

395
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:54,454
It'll be fine, darling.

396
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:06,473
Good then...

397
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,044
Crazy day. 
Are you doing well ?

398
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:11,628
I don't know, I'm knocked out.

399
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:15,016
Good. Well, 
here's the good news.

400
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:17,288
Cydney is doing well, Debbie is doing well.

401
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:19,717
We're going to evacuate Caleb.

402
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,801
- Are you kicking him out of the game now? 
- Now ?

403
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:24,857
- Caleb is out. 
- For real ?

404
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:26,557
Caleb is out of the game.

405
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,023
- Seriously, is he leaving? 
- Yes.

406
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:32,531
This chopper is coming to pick up Caleb.

407
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,780
I wish it were otherwise.

408
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:01,104
Give them a second!

409
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:04,464
- Eh, my pot! 
- Eh, Caleb!

410
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,303
We love you !

411
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,229
Its good.

412
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:34,366
We'll get through this.

413
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:37,157
- I thought he was invincible. 
- Me too.

414
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:55,300
- Well done, my daughter. 
- There, against the tree.

415
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:57,152
I'll summarize the situation for you.

416
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:58,692
It is unprecedented.

417
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:01,114
Three people down 
on a single event,

418
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:04,292
simply because 
of extreme heat

419
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:06,998
combined with dehydration 
and heavy exertion.

420
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:08,773
Nobody went there halfway.

421
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:11,965
Everyone was 
giving their all and fighting.

422
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,174
So where are we, Tai?

423
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,840
You are very touched.

424
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:18,988
I do not know.

425
00:23:19,113 --> 00:23:21,001
We lose one of our own.

426
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:23,880
We worked so hard, 
and Caleb, to give 100%.

427
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:27,240
He sacrificed himself 
so that we could do this test.

428
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,542
We come from very different...

429
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:32,145
But the first night, 
I snuggled up to him.

430
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,701
I will miss him so much!

431
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,360
Jason, is it possible,

432
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,829
for you, in this game,

433
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:42,564
after taking care of Cydney,

434
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,357
can you still eliminate it?

435
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:45,759
I have a military background.

436
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,605
If someone is injured, 
the mission no longer counts.

437
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,423
It is this person who counts.

438
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:51,959
Your partner.

439
00:23:52,084 --> 00:23:53,560
Here we live together.

440
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:55,268
Yeah, we don't all like each other.

441
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,013
But at the end of the day, 
we are a family.

442
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,807
That's what we have, the cards 
we got. We have to deal with it.

443
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:03,309
We stay together until the end.

444
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,021
Good.

445
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:09,845
Intelligence, your reward 
will be waiting for you on your camp.

446
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,982
Beauty, your reward 
will be waiting for you on your camp.

447
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,665
Beauty has lost a limb.

448
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,967
After nine days, the game continues.

449
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:21,795
Return to camp, 
get shade, hydrate.

450
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:23,163
Good luck.

451
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:30,592
Without Caleb, it's very sad.

452
00:24:30,717 --> 00:24:33,021
He will stay in my heart for a long time.

453
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:34,946
I will see him again, that's for sure.

454
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:37,085
I still want that kiss!

455
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:41,064
Before his departure, 
3 boys against 3 girls.

456
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,149
But now just Nick and me.

457
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,778
Now the girls 
can choose who to date.

458
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:49,257
So the idol is more important, 
because if we go to the council,

459
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:51,891
there's a one in two chance 
that I'll leave.

460
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:55,334
But I will not leave 
with an idol in my pocket.

461
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,800
Caleb has fully recovered, 
he is in perfect health...

462
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:06,312
and hope to play again.

463
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:19,294
Damn, what a day!

464
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,863
It was crazy!

465
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,090
I just remember 
Joe looking at me

466
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:27,165
and I'm incredibly hot.

467
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,406
He asks me whether to call 
the doctor, and I: "No, no!",

468
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,581
because it was embarrassing,

469
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:36,453
I was going to make it on my own, 
but he said, "I'm calling him.",

470
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,480
and luckily he did!

471
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:42,075
I was not only afraid 
of appearing weak in front of my tribe,

472
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,714
but also to appear weak 
in front of my daughters at home.

473
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:47,925
I like to see myself 
as an example for my daughters.

474
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,034
They often tell me...

475
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:02,295
They often tell me 
how proud they are of me.

476
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,014
I've done a lot 
of silly stuff in my life.

477
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:07,779
Crystal always tells me, 
"You are the best mother.",

478
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:14,383
They were very proud 
that I came here.

479
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:19,016
I just don't want to disappoint them.

480
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,733
Beyond this game, 
we are friends for life.

481
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:25,158
You really took care of me.

482
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:40,633
I just want to say...

483
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:43,584
I may not be 
as tall and strong as you,

484
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:46,303
But the NBA should have taught you 
that when we all hold on,

485
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:49,576
and that I try to encourage you, 
look me in the face and say to myself:

486
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:52,212
"Keep cheering, 
that's all you're good for.",

487
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,232
it's not working as a team.

488
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:57,065
What would the players say 
if you said that on a pitch?

489
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,751
First, in an NBA game, 
I'm with the best in the world.

490
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,189
There is no comparison.

491
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,876
I didn't want 
to argue with Scot,

492
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,728
but I wanted to explain 
the situation.

493
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:11,050
I did my best, 
I never gave up.

494
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:14,122
During the race, I repeated: 
"Come on, we'll get there!"

495
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,468
And Scott says:

496
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,338
"Let her take care of the encouragement, 
she's only good at that."

497
00:27:18,463 --> 00:27:20,968
On the one hand, I thought: "Shut up!"

498
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:24,572
But on the other: "Well, she helps, 
she stays positive."

499
00:27:24,697 --> 00:27:27,113
I meant it when I said, 
"Keep cheering!"

500
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:29,558
I was doing my best, 
I was trying so hard...

501
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:31,317
But I don't have your big hands.

502
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:33,295
I know it.

503
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:37,023
Whether he's bigger or stronger than me 
doesn't impress me.

504
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:39,172
I will tell him how I feel.

505
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:42,877
I want us to be more of a team, 
that we don't lower ourselves.

506
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:45,765
And with me, that's what they do.

507
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:51,127
So it's okay for you to push me 
in the middle of the test, your teammate?

508
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,275
I wasn't pushing you, I was telling you 
to shut up and dig in.

509
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,750
No, you said:

510
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,813
"Encourage us, 
you're only good at that."

511
00:27:57,938 --> 00:27:59,813
You've never been 
on a team

512
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:01,790
and you give lessons 
to a champion?

513
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:04,022
Just because 
you were in the NBA doesn't mean...

514
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:06,019
What team 
have you been part of before?

515
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,296
I played soccer. 
But it's not that.

516
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:09,539
You played. When ?

517
00:28:09,664 --> 00:28:12,366
Whether it's an NBA game 
or football between kids,

518
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,827
the moral of the story,

519
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,404
is: acting as a team, 
working as a team.

520
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:20,442
- We work together. 
- So why don't you fit in?

521
00:28:21,124 --> 00:28:24,182
On the camp, after my little discomfort,

522
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,639
I just wanted to stay cool.

523
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:30,260
And now it starts to yell, 
and I: "Oh dear!

524
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,278
You're disrupting my recovery!"

525
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:35,148
The teams could be 
mixed tomorrow. And I hope so.

526
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:38,818
- Me too ! 
- You're lucky to still be here!

527
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:41,121
Because on the next tip, 
bye-bye!

528
00:28:41,524 --> 00:28:42,525
OK.

529
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:46,593
In the Muscles tribe, 
we do everything intensely, and...

530
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:49,823
I don't think Alecia 
is aware of...

531
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,231
Anything.

532
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:54,034
"Come on, my daughter, 
listen and be attentive!"

533
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:59,165
You said cheering you 
on was wrong.

534
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,843
It was not the moment.

535
00:29:00,968 --> 00:29:02,018
It's wrong.

536
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,634
We already know what we are doing.

537
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,657
- Once again, you're not listening... 
- Then I should... Then...

538
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:11,017
You can't stop for a second 
and say to yourself:

539
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:12,494
"Maybe

540
00:29:12,744 --> 00:29:14,194
that they are right."

541
00:29:15,277 --> 00:29:17,098
Always an excuse

542
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,538
always something, 
always "I know",

543
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:22,534
always "I don't think so", 
always...

544
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,662
Assume, once in your life!

545
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:30,845
I clearly don't believe

546
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,616
that Alecia truly understands 
the world around her.

547
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,344
But I overdid it a bit. 
I am getting angry.

548
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:39,569
You know, I'm raising two girls.

549
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:42,169
They are everything to me.

550
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,299
I want them to be strong,

551
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,886
highly educated and independent,

552
00:29:50,011 --> 00:29:52,992
women who will 
manage on their own, without a dad.

553
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:56,805
And I'm obsessed 
with seeing a girl like Alecia

554
00:29:57,218 --> 00:29:59,674
who can't even 
hold a conversation.

555
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,450
You are one of those people 
who love contradiction.

556
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:04,717
Alecia is so 
low on the scale,

557
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:07,152
we're just waiting for advice.

558
00:30:07,277 --> 00:30:08,617
Packed, it is weighed.

559
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:24,157
Over here, everyone!

560
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:39,612
How are you all ?

561
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:43,084
Are you taking care of yourself, 
given what we just went through?

562
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:44,970
- Yes. 
- Absolutely.

563
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,218
Tai, did it increase 
the seriousness of the game

564
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:49,174
and the importance of staying hydrated?

565
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:52,344
Self-care is crucial.

566
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:54,020
The way is still long.

567
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:57,432
- Ready for the immunity test? 
- Yes.

568
00:30:57,557 --> 00:30:59,492
First, I collect them.

569
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:01,886
Cydney, I know 
you're going to hate giving it back.

570
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:04,673
And I know 
you don't want to give it back.

571
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,177
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

572
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:13,582
Today, two people per tribe 
will rush into the jungle,

573
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:15,350
will climb a wooden ladder,

574
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,857
will collect puzzle pieces 
and bring them back.

575
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:21,623
Two other people 
will then dive into the ocean

576
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:23,437
to get more coins.

577
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:25,652
Once all the pieces are together,

578
00:31:25,777 --> 00:31:29,127
you will solve with them 
a puzzle in the shape of a snake.

579
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:32,328
The first two tribes to finish

580
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:34,394
gain immunity, 
are shielded from the vote.

581
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,439
Losers go to the council 
where someone will be eliminated.

582
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,319
Beauty, you are one more, 
someone will not participate.

583
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:42,669
You cannot withdraw 
from two events in a row.

584
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:44,671
Julia and Anna must participate.

585
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:46,309
Who will it be?

586
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,078
- Me. 
- Tai won't participate.

587
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:50,629
Intelligence, one more person. 
It will be Joe.

588
00:31:50,754 --> 00:31:53,406
Take a seat on the bench. 
The others, a minute of organization.

589
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:54,881
And we'll start.

590
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,052
Well, on and go.

591
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,855
For immunity. 
Survivors, ready?

592
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:09,095
First, you have to rush into the jungle, 
collect the first 3 coins.

593
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,868
Muscles is in the lead.

594
00:32:14,993 --> 00:32:17,143
Beauty arrives, then Intelligence.

595
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:22,242
Three pieces. 
Untie them, get back down, go again!

596
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:25,466
Everybody is on the same foot of equality.

597
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:27,480
Debbie unties 3rd 
for Intelligence.

598
00:32:27,605 --> 00:32:30,050
- Cydney's on 3rd. 
- Go ahead, take the one below.

599
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,628
Julia has the third for Beauty.

600
00:32:33,753 --> 00:32:36,450
Everyone has all three. 
Pick them up, and let's go!

601
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:39,390
- Deb, do you have two? 
- I have one. You have two.

602
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:41,505
Intelligence forgot a coin!

603
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,980
We must come back!

604
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:44,964
They are wasting precious time!

605
00:32:45,871 --> 00:32:47,721
Muscles comes first.

606
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:49,970
Scot and Jason rush towards the water.

607
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,275
Beauty is back.

608
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,772
Michele and Nick rush off.

609
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,452
Scot and Jason 
are the first in the water.

610
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:59,921
Beauty is just behind.

611
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:02,823
Intelligence struggled 
to figure out who was wearing what.

612
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,116
Come on, let's move!

613
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:05,452
Intelligence soars.

614
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:09,043
There are three more puzzle pieces under 
there.

615
00:33:09,168 --> 00:33:11,191
You have to untie the knots 
to free them.

616
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:16,062
This is Neal and Aubry.

617
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:17,864
It's Nick and Michele for Beauty.

618
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,239
You're running out of air.

619
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:24,613
You have to hold your breath 
while undoing the knots.

620
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:27,856
Aubry dives.

621
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,000
Jason and Scot return.

622
00:33:33,983 --> 00:33:35,991
Nick and Michele return.

623
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,352
Intelligence 
has a significant delay to redo.

624
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:42,750
Come on, Beauty!

625
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:46,234
It's the final sprint, 
Nick is back at a run.

626
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,561
It's a bit longer 
for Jason and Scot.

627
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:52,332
Neal and Aubry have their three pieces.

628
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:53,608
They come back.

629
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:55,033
Come on, Michelle!

630
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:57,445
Forward, Beauty!

631
00:33:58,207 --> 00:34:00,248
Anna and Julia 
will take care of the puzzle.

632
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:02,655
Forward, Muscles!

633
00:34:03,372 --> 00:34:06,039
It will be Cydney and Alecia 
for Muscles.

634
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:08,715
Neal and Aubry 
are still in the water.

635
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:12,303
Julia and Anna are progressing well, 
if that's fair.

636
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:14,287
The kid goes here.

637
00:34:14,412 --> 00:34:16,197
There is only one possible solution,

638
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:20,068
but it will be misleading, parts 
will fit in the wrong place.

639
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:21,583
Alright, that doesn't work.

640
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,898
Come on, darling! 
Go ahead, honey, you're there!

641
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:26,364
Aubry is back.

642
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:28,710
These are Neal and Debbie 
for Intelligence.

643
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:33,442
It's all 
about your ability to collaborate

644
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:36,710
and try many options 
without losing sight of the big picture.

645
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:38,086
Like that ? No.

646
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,652
- Deb, can I come? 
- Peter is dying to participate.

647
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,468
- Come on, Peter! 
- Thanks.

648
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:44,194
Deb and Peter pass the baton.

649
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:47,887
Hippocampus, tonsils, 
frontal lobes, go!

650
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:51,024
Muscles seeks to understand 
what is wrong.

651
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,668
- So we take it off. 
- Things are bad for Beauty.

652
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:55,167
Alright, this one next.

653
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:57,196
Intelligence 
has regained a lot of time.

654
00:34:57,321 --> 00:35:00,609
Your neurons are at full speed. 
Come on, boys!

655
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:02,202
We found it, Jeff!

656
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:04,446
Intelligence thinks it has found.

657
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:05,647
And that's the case !

658
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:08,087
Intelligence gains immunity 
and is immune to the vote!

659
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:10,200
Peter arrived and it was over!

660
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,078
We are fighting for 2nd place now.

661
00:35:12,634 --> 00:35:14,222
We exchange ?

662
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:15,517
Yeah, we trade.

663
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:17,117
Beauty makes a change.

664
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:20,220
Will Nick do for Beauty 
what Peter did for Intelligence?

665
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:23,289
Don't want to try?

666
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:24,861
Alexia, concentrate.

667
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:27,594
Nick is well launched, 
he has new ideas.

668
00:35:28,932 --> 00:35:30,260
Beauty has progressed well.

669
00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:31,631
We have to get out of it.

670
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:34,910
It's always laborious 
for Muscles.

671
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,579
Another adjustment for Beauty. 
Is it over?

672
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:39,606
It seems like.

673
00:35:39,731 --> 00:35:42,475
Eh yes ! Beauty wins!

674
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:45,745
Avoid the council 
for the fourth time in a row!

675
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:48,844
Referring Muscles to the Board

676
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:51,326
where someone will be eliminated from the game.

677
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:53,929
It is the general reduction.

678
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:56,690
- How are you feeling, Alecia? 
- Not very well.

679
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:58,825
I tried.

680
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,961
- We tried. 
- We tried, yeah.

681
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:02,949
Scot, does this exchange sum it all up?

682
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:05,807
Alecia says, "I tried," 
and Cydney says, "we tried."

683
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:09,255
Alecia still thinks 
she should talk about herself

684
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,338
to be valued in his eyes.

685
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:13,709
- I think that's wrong. 
- "I tried."

686
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:16,469
- The advice will be funny. 
- In effect.

687
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:18,802
Jeff asks Alecia a question

688
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,773
and Alecia responds 
with her famous words:

689
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:25,051
"I did my best."

690
00:36:25,176 --> 00:36:27,286
It's her, her, her, her.

691
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:33,226
Intelligence Tribe, congratulations!

692
00:36:33,351 --> 00:36:34,415
Thanks, Jeff.

693
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,953
Immunity again. 
Nobody is leaving.

694
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:39,265
Beauty Tribe!

695
00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:42,944
You still avoid 
coming to see me at the council!

696
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,738
Beauty, safe from the vote.

697
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:48,090
Intelligence, get your things, 
go back to camp.

698
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:50,897
Beauty, get your things, 
go back to camp.

699
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,480
Which brings us back 
to a familiar story.

700
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:54,848
The Muscles Tribe.

701
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:58,960
So, Muscles.

702
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:01,663
Body language alone

703
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:03,440
says it all.

704
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:05,066
This tribe is not happy.

705
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:06,359
Not at this time.

706
00:37:06,484 --> 00:37:09,660
Alecia, do you feel like 
you get picked on a lot?

707
00:37:09,785 --> 00:37:12,266
Yes. And when I answered 
"I tried",

708
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:14,668
I didn't want to say 
that I had tried and she hadn't.

709
00:37:14,793 --> 00:37:18,405
I assume our failure on the puzzle. 
It was my fault.

710
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,675
What are your chances 
of surviving tonight's vote?

711
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:25,295
- Scot, you're forming a zero. 
- Zero.

712
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:27,923
- Alecia is leaving tonight. 
- If I have my say.

713
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:29,616
We will not make this mistake again.

714
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:31,049
We can vote now.

715
00:37:33,412 --> 00:37:35,822
- We can do the counseling now. 
- I am on it.

716
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:41,561
But Alecia has to agree.

717
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:43,496
I will not do 
the advice now.

718
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,598
It would be giving up. 
Absolutely not.

719
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:48,210
All right, get your things. 
We'll see you tonight,

720
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:50,985
advice, 
whether long or very short.

721
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:24,379
Has anything changed 
since the ordeal?

722
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,982
Not that I know.

723
00:38:27,393 --> 00:38:28,975
Scott, do you think the same?

724
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,019
- Yes. 
- Cydney?

725
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:35,879
So, Alecia, you have 
three people saying the same thing.

726
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,834
You are in a 
very interesting situation.

727
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:42,163
Because you are not at Muscles 
because of your physique.

728
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,815
Come on, Jeff!

729
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,336
You are there, because you do not 
let yourself count, ever.

730
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:50,463
- Do you agree ? 
- Yes.

731
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:53,733
In other words, I'm stubborn.

732
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:55,458
But moreover,

733
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,304
I never felt 
good contact with Scot and Jason,

734
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:02,183
so often when they talk to me, 
I choose not to listen.

735
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:04,633
I don't have much respect for them.

736
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:07,022
Scot, Alecia dit

737
00:39:07,147 --> 00:39:09,756
that you have to earn her respect 
to get her to listen to you.

738
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,484
And you didn't earn it.

739
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:13,186
So no one can.

740
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,822
She finds something 
she did well once

741
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:18,892
and she puts it back on the mat 
until someone freaks out.

742
00:39:19,017 --> 00:39:22,137
And I saw her do it, 
and I saw Jason freak out.

743
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:23,371
It shows me

744
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:24,945
that she needs attention.

745
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,275
Positive or negative, it doesn't matter.

746
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,743
I pity her.

747
00:39:32,846 --> 00:39:34,874
I think you're going to be 
eliminated tonight.

748
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,376
I don't think there's 
a chance another will come out.

749
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,021
I don't think I've ever seen 
such obvious advice.

750
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:43,069
And yet, 
I still support you.

751
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:46,152
Of course I want to stay.

752
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:49,097
I believe I have what it takes 
to go all the way.

753
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:50,651
If I leave tonight

754
00:39:50,776 --> 00:39:53,675
I could take it negatively 
or retain what I learned,

755
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,511
that I am grateful 
to have what I have.

756
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:59,698
Sometimes such an experience 
is worth more than money.

757
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,937
Did I miss something, 
before we vote?

758
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:06,723
Well, it's time to vote.

759
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:08,098
Cydney, over to you.

760
00:40:21,817 --> 00:40:24,317
I hope you watch this 
on repeat

761
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:27,102
and understand 
that we were really trying to help you.

762
00:40:32,624 --> 00:40:34,134
I will count the votes.

763
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:43,810
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

764
00:40:43,935 --> 00:40:45,512
now is the time to do it.

765
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,220
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

766
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:53,653
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

767
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:55,055
I will read the votes.

768
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:57,789
First vote:

769
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:05,807
Alexia. 
That's two votes Alecia,

770
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,982
one Scot vote, one vote remains.

771
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:10,601
Fourth person eliminated:

772
00:41:10,726 --> 00:41:12,614
Alexia. 
Bring me your torch.

773
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:24,960
Alecia, the tribe has spoken.

774
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,024
Good luck, Cydney!

775
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,567
Thank you darling.

776
00:41:40,286 --> 00:41:43,445
If one thing has been constant 
in this tribe,

777
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:44,804
it's your threesome.

778
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:49,031
Is this link enough 
to get you to the end?

779
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,320
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

780
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:59,474
I had never been like this 
in nature,

781
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,231
to have to live 
without shelter or food.

782
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:03,850
It changed me profoundly.

783
00:42:03,975 --> 00:42:06,801
In the end, I'm proud of myself. 
I don't think I gave up.

786
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:16,836
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

787
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,182
Next time in Survivor...

788
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:24,886
This season, the lines of power 
have been drawn.

789
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:27,188
I pull the strings behind the scenes.

790
00:42:27,313 --> 00:42:29,115
We are in a very good position.

791
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,717
We have all the power.

792
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,461
But they are about 
to be erased.

793
00:42:33,586 --> 00:42:35,730
Everyone throw down their bandana!

794
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:38,833
We change things.

795
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:42,314
My Survivor experience 
was unlike anything I've ever experienced.

796
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:45,589
To those who think it's easy, 
I say, "Try it!"

797
00:42:45,714 --> 00:42:47,175
This is serious.

798
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,614
I didn't 
think it would be so rough.

799
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:53,673
It was fun, it pushed my body 
to its limits,

800
00:42:53,798 --> 00:42:55,301
the doctors were great.

801
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:58,853
It's an experience I would do again.
