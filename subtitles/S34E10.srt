1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,330
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,960
The minority was hopeless...

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,600
Six of them are thinking,
uh-huh, we got you.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,770
and desperate.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,660
I'm willing at any moment
to throw Brad,

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,440
Tai and Troyzan under the bus.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,330
Until Andrea threw the
game off the rails.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,620
Let's make a bigger move here.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,310
But Michaela and Sarah wanted
to keep the majority intact.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,840
At Tribal Council...

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,910
the minority voted for
one of their own.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,040
And Andrea got her way.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,110
Zeke, the tribe has spoken.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,000
Nine are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought myself, Sierra,
Troyzan and Tai

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,260
were on the bottom and one
of us was going home.

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,730
But come the find, there was
a plan to get rid of Zeke.

18
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,080
But unfortunately we all put Tai down.

19
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,040
So i don't know that i have Tai anymore.

20
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,930
It was just hard.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,000
But i do think it was the right move.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,840
Yeah...

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,350
Tribal Council was a
heartbreaker, for some reason

24
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,220
we decided to acquiesce to Andrea.

25
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,260
The majority turning on
each other after one

26
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,150
vote, just means there's nothing
solid in a big group.

27
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,640
If the pair of Brad and
Sierra stay together long enough

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,000
and they can convince enough
people to come back to that

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
side, we're back in trouble.

30
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,370
So we got to split that up.

31
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,950
So we are feeling
losing control in this game

32
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,220
and feeling like you're at
the botton, because

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,730
you have nothing to lose.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,080
Sarah has been my
closest friend, not even alliance,

35
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,820
friend, while being out here.

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,770
And i feel like i really
got burned by her.

37
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,460
But she might be a key person
to get me further in this game.

38
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,060
I need to leave that
behind us and

39
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,880
somehow try to continue to work together.

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,330
I'm about to throw haly mary up here...

41
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,460
- Ok.
- And i maybe shouldn't.

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,570
What?

43
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,080
But...

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,620
I found something on the first day.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,150
It's called the legacy advantage.

46
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,480
For real?

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,060
- What is that?
- It's an inmmunity idol.

48
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,620
But you can only play it at six.

49
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,220
- Ok.
- But...

50
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,620
if we can get to six, it can help us.

51
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,950
Right.

52
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,880
And if not, i get to will it
to someone, and you're

53
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,350
going to get a pretty present.

54
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,640
What if i'm gone?

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
- For real?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,080
Sarah is the first one
i've told about my advantage.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,640
I want to use it as a way
to weasel in there.

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,750
"You still have me, girl."

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,750
I hope you don't have to
will it to me.

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,860
The door is not closed
for you, i'm just telling you.

61
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,710
I swear on everything, i will vote

62
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,660
where you guys tell me to vote.

63
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,710
And i'm willing to write
down anybody's name.

64
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,770
All right.

65
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,860
Brad and Sierra need
to be split up.

66
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,220
When Sierra told me
about this advantage,

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,750
it actually makes me
want to keep her now because

68
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,640
she's giving me information,
and she wants to work with me.

69
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,370
So the door is opening
for her to stay in this game

70
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,910
and Brad's game is over.

71
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,130
Subtitulado por: TwiNe

72
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,550
Come on in, guys!

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,040
All right, are you guys ready to
get to today's reward challenge?

74
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,280
- Yeah.
- Yes.

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,120
The winners of today's challenge
will have a good old-fashioned...

76
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,680
american barbecue.

77
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,400
Burgers...

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,800
- hot dogs.
- Oh, my god.

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,080
And cupcakes for dessert.

80
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
- Worth playing for?
- Yes!

81
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,120
There's more.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,760
You are also playing for
your loved ones.

83
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,080
What?

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,200
Oh, my god.

85
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,920
All right, Sarah, clearly
you are ready for this.

86
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,320
You're up.

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,080
Sarah, who are you hoping to see?

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,280
- My husband.
- Wyatt.

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,840
Come on out, Wyatt.

90
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, my god.

91
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,520
Sarah, tell me about Wyatt.

92
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,480
Him and my son are the two
most important people in my life.

93
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,120
Anyone who has
kids knows it's not easy,

94
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,920
and then to have me just 
completely sucked out of his life

95
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,200
and have to do it
100% on his own,

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,400
just the support he gives me,
i couldn't ask for anything better.

97
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,160
Wyatt, did you give her
an update on how the son is doing?

98
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,360
Just that he's doing great.

99
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,560
He misses her, he says mommy
every day, every morning.

100
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,400
We're ready for her to be home.

101
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,440
All right.
Give him a hug.

102
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,320
Damn, he's sexy, Sarah.

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,320
All right.
Andrea, you're up.

104
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,120
Let's bring mom Linda out.
Come on out, Linda.

105
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,360
Hi, mommy.

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,680
Andrea, what is it about your mom

107
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,400
that connects you so strongly to her?

108
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,240
I mean, she's just the
sweetest, most loving,

109
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,000
forgiving mom ever.

110
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,480
I was just a troublemaker growing up.

111
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
You were fine.

112
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,400
Yeah.

113
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,400
She...she had some hard things
that happened in high school, so,

114
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,960
you know, she lost her sister,
and so that's... i'm sorry.

115
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,360
But it's all because of your
sister that we're really here.

116
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,440
Really?

117
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,320
Yeah, she really encouraged me to apply.

118
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,960
I feel like every time
i come and play Survivor,

119
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,320
i feel more connected to her.

120
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
I just know she's proud of us

121
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,840
and she's just happy that we're
still like a loving family.

122
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,920
Well, i'm glad you're out here, Linda.

123
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,880
- Give her a hug.
- Thanks.

124
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,120
- I love you.
- I love you.

125
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,400
Aubry, you're up.

126
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,440
Who is here?

127
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,680
I think it's my sister Carrie.

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,760
Your sister Carrie.
Come on out, Carrie.

129
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,400
- This is everyone.
- Hi, everyone.

130
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,200
Aubry, outside of food,
in the hierarchy of need,

131
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,640
the trust, the love, the
affection your getting right now,

132
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,120
there's a bond with siblings
that's unlike any other bond.

133
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,640
Can you capture what that is?

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,680
I think it's just knowing that 
that person has seen every single

135
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,360
shade of you and they still unconditionally 
accept you for who you are.

136
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,120
And that means a lot.

137
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,480
Give her a hug.

138
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,160
Sierra, you were lucky enough
to have a loved one

139
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,800
visit first time you played.

140
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,600
It was your dad, and he's back.

141
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,320
Dan, come on out.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,280
Sierra, this is the first time
in 30 days i've seen this body language

143
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
where you're at ease.

144
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,880
You feel safe.

145
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,040
Yep, this game is so hard.

146
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,600
I haven't been able to
let my guard down for one minute,

147
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,360
and just to have him here...

148
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,880
i mean, i'm shaking.

149
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,640
I'm really proud of her for playing

150
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,080
at such a high level of competition.

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,080
I hope she can keep thick skinned.

152
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
What made you say that?

153
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,320
Because this is a really great
piece of advice for everybody.

154
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,280
Life is so fragile.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,800
And no matter how hard you
try to play anything in life,

156
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,640
there's always going to be
somebody trying to take you down.

157
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,280
And you have to just be
thick skinned and try to

158
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,400
climb the mountain to
the top and get there.

159
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
All right, give your
daughter a last hug.

160
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,320
Michaela.

161
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,320
Let's get your mom out here.

162
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,200
Candy, come on out.

163
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,280
There she is.

164
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,080
Michaela, what is it about your mom?

165
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
She works hard every single day,

166
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,600
and it's just one of those
people they do everything

167
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,400
they're supposed to do, but
sometimes life knocks you down

168
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,600
and you find yourself in a
situation where all you can do is work.

169
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,040
And so her just being able
to be somewhere like Fiji

170
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,440
and enjoy and not worry
about how much stuff costs or

171
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,080
who is going to pay
for it or what somebody else needs.

172
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,200
Me being able to give
her this opportunity,

173
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,800
that means more to me
than anything else right now.

174
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,120
All right.
Give her a hug.

175
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,920
- Troyzan.
- Oh, Troyzan.

176
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,560
Now, who are you expecting to see?

177
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
My brother Todd, but i'm
not sure if he made it.

178
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,040
Let's find out.

179
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,400
Come on out.

180
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,880
It's your bro.

181
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,880
God!

182
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,760
I can't believe it.

183
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,760
Troyzan, i'm trying to remember

184
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,480
if i've ever seen a
brother reunion like this.

185
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,920
There's no lack of affection
between you guys.

186
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,240
Zero, i mean...

187
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,720
we've been close since
we were this high.

188
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,200
And i feel more whole
family here, i have a big family.

189
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,040
There's six of us kids,
three boys, three girls.

190
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,360
We're like the brady bunch.
So... this is Peter.

191
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,120
We're glad you're out here.
Give him a hug.

192
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,840
Tai.

193
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,920
You look like you're
ready for some love.

194
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,520
Who do you want to see?

195
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,920
The love of my life, Mark.

196
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,680
Mark, come on out.

197
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,920
Mark.

198
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,360
Tell me about Tai.

199
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,040
He's an incredible person.

200
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,240
He's the best person i
think i've ever met.

201
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,280
He brings out the best in me.

202
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,320
And i think i do the same for him.

203
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,920
And i'm so lucky to have found him.

204
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,040
Give him a hug.

205
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,200
Culpepper.

206
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,640
Go get'em, buddy.

207
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,120
You have a very unique
situation in that you're the

208
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,920
only person out here
whose loved one, your wife,

209
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,640
has actually played this game.

210
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,560
She has.

211
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,800
Monica.

212
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,080
Now, Culpepper, anybody who is
a Survivor fan knows Monica.

213
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,280
But we know her in
the Survivor World.

214
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,000
She's tougher than me.
She's stronger than me.

215
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,160
And...

216
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:53,480
And i never realized how hard
it was on you to go all the way.

217
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,480
Thank you, sweetie.

218
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,920
Give him some last love.

219
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,840
One person left, Cirie.

220
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,160
You made a giant sacrifice this
time, what was it?

221
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,160
I have three boys at home.

222
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,920
The youngest graduated high school...

223
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,720
while i was here.

224
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,760
Shall we get him out
here and see how graduation went?

225
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,240
Jared, come on out.

226
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,920
Tell me about your mom, Jared.

227
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I'm so lucky.
Some of my friends

228
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,720
can't even talk to their moms,
and me and her are just like

229
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
two peas in a pod.

230
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,680
Cirie, Jared just said something i
don't think i've ever heard

231
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,400
in an 18-year-old young man say,

232
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,680
which is i can talk
to my mom about everything.

233
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,440
This is typically the time they
tell their parents nothing.

234
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,760
No Jeff, we have a relationship...

235
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,080
that is like no other.

236
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,280
I wanted them to be able
to come and tell me anything.

237
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,160
We talk about some things i
might not even want to share.

238
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,960
Jared, give your mom some love.

239
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,640
All right, now you know
what you're playing for.

240
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,040
The loved ones will go with you
and enjoy that barbecue.

241
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,680
Here's what you have to do
to earn the loved ones.

242
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,120
For today's challenge, you'll
be tethered together

243
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,760
in groups of three.

244
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
On my go, you'll race through
a series of obstacles to a table

245
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,200
where you'll untangle
braided rope to release a key.

246
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,080
That key will open a
chest full of sandbags.

247
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,640
You will use them to
knock down a series of targets.

248
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,280
The first team to win
will go with their loved ones.

249
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,040
You'll have a nice barbecue,
nice afternoon.

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,600
Big stakes.

251
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,760
We're going to draw for
teams, we'll get started.

252
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,920
All right, we have our three teams.

253
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,720
It is Culpepper, Aubry and Andrea.

254
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,200
Cirie, Troyzan and Sierra.

255
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,240
And Tai, Sarah and Michaela
for an barbecue and love.

256
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,040
Survivors ready?

257
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,600
Go!

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,560
You're going to have to work
together to win this challenge.

259
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,560
Up and over that first obstacle.

260
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,360
We are dead even.

261
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,920
Everybody pushing hard.

262
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,280
Now you're going to crawl.

263
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,760
Sierra's out first.

264
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,720
Michaela right behind.

265
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,320
Here comes Andrea's team.

266
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,200
Troyzan is dragging Cirie.

267
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,720
Now you got to dig under
and get everybody under.

268
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,360
30 days you're already exhausted.

269
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,160
It's that love that's
powering you right now.

270
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,320
Andrea trying to squeeze through.

271
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,720
Andrea through.

272
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,520
Here goes Aubry.

273
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,920
Starting to pull ahead.

274
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,440
Tai going to go under
now for his team.

275
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,720
Go ahead, you got it.
Straighten your leg out.

276
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,080
I can't straighten it!

277
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,920
Sierra's leg stuck.

278
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,320
She's going to come back out.

279
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,360
Culpepper going to try
the shove that body through.

280
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,680
Can he do it?

281
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Culpepper is through.
Move on!

282
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,000
Andrea, Aubry and Culpepper
in the lead right now.

283
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,760
Now you have to sthufl the
pieces on the table.

284
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,440
Untangle that rope and release the key.

285
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,840
Tai continuing to try
to get through this.

286
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,760
Here goes Cirie coming through.

287
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,760
Squeeze through, ma!

288
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,920
Cirie is through.

289
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,560
That's it, Andrea!

290
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
You got to let that key drop.

291
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,720
Once you're fully unbrainded.

292
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,720
There you go, release it.

293
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,640
Culpepper, Aubry, Andrea
moving on to the sandbags.

294
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,160
Unlock that box.

295
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,240
There goes Michaela face first.

296
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,760
She's through.
You're good.

297
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,760
Troyzan's through.
They're both pulling Sierra.

298
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,840
You're good.

299
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,640
Michaela, Sarah and Tai
trying to get the key.

300
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,920
Andrea, Aubry and Culpepper
in the lead right now.

301
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,960
Culpepper firing now.

302
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
Culpepper tosses and connects.

303
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,640
You got to knock all the
targets off the platform.

304
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,320
Culpepper with another big hit.

305
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,640
Culpepper on fire with another hit.

306
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,160
Great job, babe!

307
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,360
Culpepper knocks off another two.

308
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,720
He's down to three left.
One left.

309
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,440
Culpepper, Aubry and Andrea
win love and barbecue!

310
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,400
Loved one, come on
over and join them.

311
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,000
You will all share in the barbecue.

312
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
All right.
Big decision.

313
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,200
The three of you, Culpepper,
Andrea, Aubry, choose one player

314
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,480
and their loved one to join you
for this barbecue back at camp...

315
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,320
Brad, please.

316
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,040
and look already at the pressure.

317
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,320
Culpepper!

318
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,440
All right, who are you going to choose?

319
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,040
Cirie.

320
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,320
Come on over, Cirie.
Jared, come join.

321
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,920
You're sorry you all can't have love?

322
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,160
I am because i know
how they need it.

323
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,040
Aubry, Andrea, Culpepper,
put you through it again,

324
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,880
one last person...

325
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,240
- Please, y'all, come on.
- to join you.

326
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,280
Sarah.

327
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,520
Oh, my god.

328
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
Sarah, come on over.
Wyatt, come join.

329
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,640
Loved ones, have to say
good-bye to you.

330
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Dan, Todd, Candy, Mark.
Time to say goodbye.

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,440
All right, everybody, grab your
stuff, head back to camp.

332
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,920
Have a good afternoon.

333
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,800
That was a very, very
difficult decision.

334
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,000
Michaela was completely defeated.

335
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,640
But Michaela is very
smart, and knows that

336
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,280
this is a game, so
we'll give Michaela a day.

337
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,240
She'll get over it, and
we'll be back on track.

338
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,200
- Burgers are ready.
- Hot dogs, too.

339
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,880
And there's steak and sausage.

340
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,360
Jared is like his mom.
He's not an island boy.

341
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,360
He's a city kid, you know,
he's never been anywhere.

342
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,680
It's huge to see him open
to different things.

343
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,400
The only thing that would
be better than that is

344
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,320
for me to make it to
the end and win for him.

345
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm very fortunate that my loved
one is a former stud Survivor player.

346
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,840
She's a huge resource for me.

347
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Michaela was angry after
she was not selected.

348
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,160
So hopefully Troyzan and
Sierra are back at camp

349
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,360
trying to convince Michaela to flip
and get in alignment with us.

350
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,680
Otherwise i have to win
immunity for me

351
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
to be able to make it another day.

352
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,160
I was really disappointed to
not get picked.

353
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,400
- But... but...
- I know.

354
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,200
Your mom is so cute, so sweet.

355
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,840
And you can see where
people's loyalties lie.

356
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,520
Like i'm a really loyal person,

357
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,440
but maybe people are
just taking advantage of that.

358
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,320
And they don't even
see me in their plans.

359
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,360
I was really pissed off
at the reward challenge,

360
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,200
because they didn't
care about me and my mother.

361
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,280
So i saw a huge opportunity to
move myself forward in the game.

362
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,800
Tai is awesome to work with,
because he has no one.

363
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,640
Maybe this is time to think about

364
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,080
who i actually connect with
and who i can trust.

365
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,520
And i feel like you could
be one of those people for me

366
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,760
and i could be one of
those people for you.

367
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Definitely.

368
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,240
Uh... no, i love it.

369
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
You know, i'm ride or die
you and Brad.

370
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,280
I know.

371
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm open to figuring out a way.

372
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,920
Listen, if we get two people,

373
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,720
let's just talk.

374
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,320
You, me, Brad, Michaela and Tai.

375
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,000
I mean, she's up and down.

376
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,800
I know, hey, if everything works,

377
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,680
we are in the majority again.

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,840
I don't want to turn my
back on Brad or Troyzan.

379
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,920
So i'm hoping that maybe
we can pull Tai back into our mix

380
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,560
and maybe have an
in with now Michaela.

381
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,840
Whom i've never worked with.

382
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,200
It's a great opportunity
because she's the kind of person

383
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,480
to get upset, feel disrespected and flip.

384
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm trying to figure out how
to make these last nine days work.

385
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,280
And i've spent a lot of
time just being told

386
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,680
what to do in this game.

387
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,200
Right.

388
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,640
Look Zeke... they told me,
like, this is going to be our six.

389
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,760
This is going to be our six.

390
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,840
And the first vote you
vote out someone in the six.

391
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,320
That's what Andrea told us to do.

392
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,800
- Andrea is doing everything.
- Yeah.

393
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,120
I'm telling you right now.

394
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,160
If any of us in the end are
with Andrea, none of us win.

395
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,920
Yeah.

396
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,840
Right now, i feel like
we are all in agreement on Andrea.

397
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,400
Plus Brad.

398
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,080
I want you to know now
i'm on the exact same page as you, girl.

399
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,080
Like, in the same page.

400
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,880
I put Tai and me
in a wonderful position.

401
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,400
The stars aligned for us.
We've got options.

402
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,160
Be with the group that votes
Andrea, or be with the group

403
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,320
that votes Brad.

404
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,440
And we'll come to that decision
whenever it's time to come to

405
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,360
that decision, but at the end of
the day, this is about Michaela

406
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
and what Michaela is trying to
to in this game.

407
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,640
- Exciting.
- We don't need no steak.

408
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,200
Come on in, guys!

409
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,920
All right, you guys ready to get
to today's inmmunity challenge?

410
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,640
Yes.

411
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,280
First things first, Andrea,
we'll take it back.

412
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,640
Thank you for meeting
me half way.

413
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,560
Once again immunity
is back up for grabs.

414
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,000
For today's challenge, you're
going to balance on a narrow

415
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,960
perch while holding a buoy
between two handles.

416
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,880
If at any point the buoy drops...

417
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,600
or you fall off the perch...

418
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
you're out.

419
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:59,000
Last person left standing wins
immunity, safe at the vote.

420
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,640
Losers, Tribal Council.
Somebody will be the twelfth

421
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,720
person voted out and become
the fifth member of our jury.

422
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,200
We'll draw to spots.
We'll get to it.

423
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,360
All right, everybody take your spots.

424
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,360
I'm going to count you in.

425
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,320
Here we go. Five, four,
three, two, one.

426
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,240
All right, everybody is in a good
spot and this challenge is on.

427
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,920
Already Sarah fighting to
balance but recovers quickly.

428
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,000
Brand-new Survivor challenge.

429
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,440
Somebody here will be
the first person to win it.

430
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,280
Aubry squirming, trying to hold on.

431
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,160
Aubry drops.

432
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,960
Aubry is first out of this challenge.

433
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,080
No shot at immunity.

434
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,640
And right behind Aubry,
Sierra drops.

435
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,680
There's not a lot of buildup.

436
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,360
It will just happen and you're out.

437
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
These buoys are going to
twist and turn a lot on you.

438
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,440
It's okay as long as you
keep those handles

439
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,560
in that center hole,
you're still alive.

440
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,920
Culpepper wobbling a bit.
Nice recovery.

441
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360
Sarah starts to wobble
and another recovery.

442
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,960
Andrea out of nowhere squirming.

443
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,480
Andrea drops.
Andrea's out.

444
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,840
Sarah with another nice recovery.

445
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,600
Can she hold on?

446
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,920
Sarah can't hang on.
Sarah drops.

447
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,240
Andrea and Sarah are out.
We're now down to five.

448
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,360
Cirie squirming.

449
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,880
Cirie now pops out.
Cirie is now out.

450
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,360
And Troyzan drops.

451
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,920
We're down to three.

452
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,720
Just like that, in matter of 30
seconds we lose four people.

453
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,320
It is Michaela, Culpepper
and Tai fighting for immunity,

454
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,640
security at Tribal Council.

455
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,160
We've been out here 18 minutes now.

456
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,320
Michaela has not budged.
She's solid.

457
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Tai now reajusting,
still looking solid.

458
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,720
Culpepper squirming.

459
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,920
That buoy starting to move,
but he's still fighting.

460
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,400
This is where the willpower kicks in

461
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,760
and the thought of wearing
that necklace, the prize,

462
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,040
the security.

463
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Tai with more movement on those buoys.

464
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,200
Those handle starting to move.
The buoy starting to move.

465
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,640
Fatigue starting to hit
everybody now.

466
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,200
Michaela right on the edge.

467
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,520
Out of nowhere, Michaela drops.

468
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,480
We're down to two, Culpepper and
Tai, side by side for immunity.

469
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,720
Culpepper has been
struggling with his balance

470
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,080
and has hung in there
this entire time.

471
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,000
Tai squirming a little more now.

472
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,120
You've been fighting for
32 days, keep fighting right now.

473
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,320
Tai drops.

474
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,600
Culpepper wins individual immunity.

475
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,240
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.

476
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,280
Culpepper, come on over.

477
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,200
Culpepper's first individual immunity
win in all your time on Survivor.

478
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,120
You are safe tonight at Tribal Council.

479
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,560
As for everybody else,
somebody going home tonight.

480
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,720
Should make for a lot of scrambling.

481
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,080
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.

482
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,560
See you tonight at Tribal.
Congrats.

483
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,720
Brad won inmmunity,
and saved himself.

484
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,120
And because of that, the whole
idea of splitting up Brad and Sierra,

485
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,840
i think Sierra is
in trouble, i think

486
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,880
Andrea is in trouble, and
it's funny because everybody

487
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
thinks i'm voting with them.

488
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,840
So a couple of people
going to be blindsided tonight.

489
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,400
- Congrats.
- Good job, Brad.

490
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,320
That is amazing.
I struggled the whole time.

491
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,520
Before the challenge, we were
planning on taking out Brad.

492
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
And Brad ends up winning inmmunity.

493
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,920
So it does kind of limit our choices.

494
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,600
The original five say Sierra
is the one to vote off tonight.

495
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,200
- Sierra.
- Ok.

496
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,640
We have to have the numbers.

497
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,960
We don't need to talk about it.

498
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,080
and strategically, both groups want us.

499
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
- Andrea.
- Ok.

500
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,560
Michaela and Tai told me
that my name is getting thrown around,

501
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,440
and i'm absolutely terrified,
but people have gave me their word.

502
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,480
And it's myself, Brad,
Troyzan, Tai, and Michaela

503
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,280
who are going to vote for Andrea.

504
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,840
So i'm hoping people are
looking at the big picture right now

505
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
and i'm not the biggest threat.

506
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,960
It's Andrea.

507
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,200
- Sierra.
- Is that how you feel?

508
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,680
- Yeah, i'm good.
- Cool, i'm good.

509
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,760
So, originally i didn't want
to vote Sierra out.

510
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,680
But Brad won immunity,
and if Sierra goes,

511
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,760
it is not all bad because
Sierra has told me

512
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
about this legacy advantage.

513
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,880
And that she would will
it to me if she leaves.

514
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,440
Now the only trick is, i need 
to confirm that Sierra thinks i'm

515
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,400
good with her to ensure that
she gives it to me.

516
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,000
I don't want to vote her out.

517
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But this isn't about making friends.

518
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,240
This is about winning one million dolars.

519
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,560
My lips are sealed.

520
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,160
So now according to Sierra,

521
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,040
Tai and Michaela might
be voting out Andrea,

522
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
which is news to me.

523
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,760
I need them to help me
vote Sierra out,

524
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,800
because i need that advantage.

525
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,080
I think we need to get Sierra out.

526
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,080
She told me she found
a legacy advantage.

527
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,400
And essentially what it is,
is it's an immunity idol.

528
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,840
So we got to get her out.

529
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,280
Initially it was get Andrea
because she might win everything.

530
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,240
But the fact that
Sierra has an advantage

531
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,560
further convolutes what's the best
move to make right now.

532
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,440
Let's get Sierra out because
she's got that advantange.

533
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,240
So she's got to be the
one to go no matter what.

534
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,680
Tai and i need to decide
which way to go tonight.

535
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,920
Sierra is a good person
to get rid of,

536
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,640
but we would like Andrea
gone sooner than later.

537
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,320
The question is:
Is now the best time?

538
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,160
It's a great thing when
the decision is in your hand

539
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,000
as long as you
make the right one.

540
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,440
Because if you make the wrong one,

541
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,520
you'll end up on the
jury looking stupid.

542
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,840
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.

543
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,200
Hali, Ozzy, Debbie,

544
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,160
and Zeke voted out at
the last Tribal Council.

545
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,160
All right, so let's start
with the loved one visit.

546
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,520
Andrea, you get to
choose two other people to go,

547
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,480
but you can only choose two.

548
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,880
Walk me through your decision
to choose Cirie and Sarah.

549
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,840
Yeah, it's such a hard decision.

550
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,360
We know how much love means out here.

551
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,640
You can enjoy hanging
out with your loved ones,

552
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,600
but in the back of your
mind, you're thinking,

553
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,680
are there going to be consequences.

554
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,400
So Sierra, that leaves you,
Michaela, Tai and Troyzan behind.

555
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,520
What kind of damage can
that do in this game?

556
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,760
I mean, well, you have us four.

557
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,800
Who just happen to be
the four who didn't get to go on

558
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,200
the reward last time,

559
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,120
so we just go to get
closer and figure out

560
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,880
if we want to move forward
in the game together or not.

561
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,160
Aubry, the game really
can turn on emotion.

562
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,040
You make one wrong decision,

563
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,360
and somebody doesn't
like it or feel good about it,

564
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,800
and the game pivots.

565
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,920
Absolutely, Jeff.

566
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,560
I think that holds true in
every single interaction.

567
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,040
Not just a big decision
like a loved ones visit.

568
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,720
But all those little
things can also add up.

569
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,480
Culpepper, let's talk about
the individual immunity challenge.

570
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,120
Really your first
big win on Survivor.

571
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,200
Yes, i mean...

572
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,440
This helps me, but it doesn't help
that the four are on the bottom.

573
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,200
So i can't revel in the glory
of my first immunity win.

574
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,240
Sierra, when you fall out
in an immunity challenge.

575
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,440
Are you wanting someone to win?

576
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,320
Are you thinking about your 
pitch when you go back to camp?

577
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,680
I wasn't even concerned
who was going to win.

578
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,320
I see about myself, i'm in trouble.

579
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,680
But i'm still here,
i'm still a vote.

580
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,880
I think there are
bigger people in this game

581
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
that they need to be 
worried about than me.

582
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Like who?

583
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,560
There are people at
challenges who are stronger.

584
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,080
Who go longer than me, you know?

585
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,760
There's Andrea.

586
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,760
I don't feel like i'm the biggest threat.

587
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,120
Hands down.

588
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,680
Andrea, singled out.

589
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,240
I get what she's saying
that i've won two immunity

590
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,920
challenges, so that looks threatening.

591
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,360
But right now there are people
that are on the botton are big underdog.

592
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,960
So if one of them sneaks
by and get to the end,

593
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,920
they have a good shot
of winning this game.

594
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,000
Aubry, both have a point.

595
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,600
Yes, everyone sees Survivor
through a certain lens.

596
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,040
I think we're all seeing it
with ourselves at the center.

597
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,920
And each of us has to
decide what kind of threat

598
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,840
is the most threatening to me.

599
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,040
Sarah, is it hard to put
this season in its spot

600
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,200
right now, because it has been
so uneven and unpredictable.

601
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,320
Yeah, just when you think you
know what's going on,

602
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,920
you seem to not
know what's going on.

603
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,080
But we've got a solid
group, right now.

604
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,120
Hopefully we all stick together.

605
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,920
But has the deck reshuffleed?

606
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,960
Michaela, can you ever trust

607
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,440
anybody who says "we have a group"?

608
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,720
Isn't that often the phrase
said before somebody

609
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,120
in that we is blindsided and realizes,

610
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,920
guess i wasn't in the "we" after all.

611
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,000
We is relative to whoever feels

612
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,520
like they're the big W at the moment.

613
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,280
And that W can flip
upside down and be

614
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
a me if you ain't watching.

615
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,520
So it's just one of those things.

616
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,280
You stick with the we until it's

617
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,480
about to turn and bite you.

618
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,880
Then you run.

619
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,120
Andrea, maybe the
toughest thing

620
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,000
about tribal is you
can't believe a single word.

621
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,640
So what do you do?

622
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,200
Yeah, i mean, i've already
heard things tonight that have

623
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,680
raised a lot of red flags.

624
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,080
But then you're thinking, are 
they really good and just bluffing?

625
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,640
You have to think about
the conversations you had

626
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,280
with the people you feel
good about earlier in the day,

627
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,320
and just hope that that 
is sticking true tonight.

628
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,760
Sierra, you were nodding
your head at that.

629
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,720
Yeah.

630
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,280
The people who took the time 
to speak to Sierra today,

631
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,480
i'm staying true 
to what they said.

632
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,480
And i'm believing in them,

633
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,600
and that's how 
i'm voting tonight.

634
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,680
But i probably have talked to
the same people Sierra talked to,

635
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,000
so they're lying to
either me or her.

636
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,280
Yep.

637
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,280
That's what it is.

638
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,280
And Michaela, that is exactly
what you were talking about.

639
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,160
It's fine as long as the We is a We,

640
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,760
and not a Me.

641
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,600
And it's about to 
become a Me for somebody.

642
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,200
It is time to vote.
Cirie, you're up.

643
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,280
It's either you or me, girl.

644
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,440
I hope i'm a part of the real we.

645
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,880
I'll go tally the votes.

646
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,360
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,

647
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,000
now would be the time to do so.

648
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,120
Okay, once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

649
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,880
Person voted out will be asked
to leave the Tribal Council area inmediately.

650
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,520
I'll read the votes.

651
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,560
First vote...

652
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,320
Sierra.

653
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,280
Andrea.

654
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,600
Sierra.

655
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,000
Andrea.
We're tied.

656
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,040
Two votes Sierra,
two votes Andrea.

657
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,240
Andrea.
That's three votes Andrea.

658
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,560
Sierra.
We're tied again.

659
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,920
Three votes Sierra,
three votes Andrea.

660
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,880
Sierra.
That's four votes Sierra, three votes Andrea.

661
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,240
12th person voted out
and fifth member of our jury:

662
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,720
Sierra.
You need to bring me your torch.

663
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,320
Sierra, the tribe has spoken.

664
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,480
- Time for you to go.
- Yep.

665
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,320
Privilege, guys.

666
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,800
This is the Legacy Advantage.

667
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,320
Now that i'm out, i get to will
it to whomever i want.

668
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,880
It's a very hard decision.

669
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,840
I hope you didn't
vote for me tonight,

670
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,800
but i will be giving it to Saran.

671
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,640
She was honest with me
and real with me out here

672
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,400
and deserves to win this game.

673
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,160
So i hope Sarah gets to use it
as six and makes a huge move with it.

674
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,560
Well, with eight players left

675
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,160
and several seats still
open on the jury,

676
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,640
it might be time to
prepare for a storm,

677
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,280
because it's coming.

678
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,680
Grab your torches, head back to camp.
Good night.

679
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,360
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

680
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,920
Next time on Survivor...

681
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,720
Tensions are high.

682
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,520
Go fish.

683
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
I'm just making sure
he's not looking for an idol.

684
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,440
I'm not going to kowtow
to some diva's demands.

685
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,880
Forcing Cirie to make
a tought decision.

686
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
I'm never going to be
able to live with myself.

687
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,640
Damn, could i pull that off?

688
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,440
- Crazy.
- It turns everything upside down.

689
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,640
I thought i was part of the we.

690
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,960
And it looks like i was not.

691
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,920
I think i was too comfortable.

692
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,440
But i came in with
guns blazing,

693
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,200
gave it hell, and i made it
further than i thought i could.

694
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,160
Of course i wanted
to go further but

695
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,680
i couldn't be more proud
of myself right now.
