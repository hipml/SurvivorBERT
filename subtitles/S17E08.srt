up on the red tribe Fang.

to a hidden immunity idol.

26

whole thing.

00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,872
So I feel like you guys should

30

00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,802
immunity idol into the ocean.

41
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,887

reshuffled.

44
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,265

45
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,517
just divided yourself into two

46
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,310

to the yellow tribe, where they

50
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,982
were outnumbered, but not

51
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,985
outplayed.

52
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:09,694
>> Really?

53
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,570
>> Yes.

54

55
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,906

take out Marcus.

57
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,949
The tribe has spoken.

58
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,618
In one swift move, Kenny and

59
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,243
Crystal had knocked out one of

60
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,204
their biggest rivals.

61
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,371
Just when you think you're in

62
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,082
control of this game, blindside.

63
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,834
And after enduring 24 days of

64
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,127
grief, life is looking pretty

65
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,755
good for the underdogs.

66
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,256
Only nine are left.

67
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,342
Who will be voted out tonight?

68
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,696
>> Ah, Kenny, you impressed me.

69
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,989
All that talking you did.

70
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,327
I'm proud of you, though,

71
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,370
that you're coming out of your

72
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,704
shell like that.

73
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,956
That's great.

74
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,749
>> Tonight was a huge night for

75
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,251
me because it could have been

76
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,920
me tonight, and thank God it

77
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:09,379
wasn't.

78
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,755
I learned from Crystal at the

79
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,214
last seven Tribals.

80
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,967
(laughter)

81
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,426
I've been under the radar at

82
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,178
Fang in the beginning, and now

83
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,097
I have to stand up for myself.

84
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,140
And so far, the last two Tribal

85
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,642
Councils I've been to, they've

86
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,477
been blindsides because-because

87
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,353
of me.

88
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,564
>> Well, I bet Marcus didn't

89
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,107
see that coming.

90
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,067
>> No.

91
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,694
>> The next one to go is Bob.

92
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,404
So Bob should be worried right

93
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,530
now.

94
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,412
>> If I'm to last, I'm assuming

95
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,873
I need to be in a merge.

96
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,207
If we're not in a merge, I

97
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,418
think I'm history.

00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,135
>> Yes, we are.

194
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,220
>> PROBST: For today's

195
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,137
challenge, you're going to do a

196
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,681
little golfing,<i> Survivor style.</i>

197
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,392
Using a large slingshot, you

198
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,727
will aim and shoot your ball

199
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,897
toward the hole...

200
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,481
until finally you land your

201
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,566
ball in the hole.

202
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,610
The tribe with the lowest

203
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,612
number of shots wins the hole.

204
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,447
The best two out of three wins

205
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,156
reward.

206
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,990
Want to know what you're

207
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:48,616
playing for?

208
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,742
>> Yes.

209
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,827
>> PROBST: You will be taken to

210
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,536
a Gabonese village, where you

211
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,496
will enjoy a beautiful dance

212
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,499
ceremony, have a nice meal...

213
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:56,707
>> Wow.

214
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,334
>> PROBST: ...and spend the

215
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:58,668
night.

216
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,001
>> Oh, my God.

217
00:06:59,085 --> 00:06:59,669
>> PROBST: You'll return to camp

218
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,504
in the morning.

219
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,713
In addition, the winning tribe

220
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,048
will send one person from the

221
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,425
losing tribe to Exile Island.

222
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,468
Fang, you have one extra

223
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,052
member-- sitting somebody out.

224
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,595
Who you going to sit out this

225
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,429
time?

226
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:10,805
>> Is that cool?

227
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,639
Okay.

228
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,349
>> PROBST: All right, Corinne,

229
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,142
you'll be on the bench.

230
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:14,934
Everybody else, we'll get you

231
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,103
started.

232
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,526
Kota has the first shot.

233
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,695
300 yards to the hole, slight

234
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,780
downhill grade.

235
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,117
>> One, two, three.

236
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,827
>> PROBST: Bob launches back.

237
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,620
Just over my head.

238
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,747
Nice shot.

239
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,666
Just shy of 150 yards.

240
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:42,003
Fang is up.

241
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,546
Matty launches.

242
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,463
>> Oh, my God.

243
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,674
Oh, my God!

244
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,675
>> PROBST: Another nice shot.

245
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,721
Head over.

246
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,223
Both drives pretty even.

247
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,350
Fang outdrove Kota by just a

248
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,977
bit, so Kota will shoot first.

249
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,061
>> Ready?

250
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,315
One, two, three, go.

251
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,524
>> PROBST: Bob launches

252
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,693
straight at the hole.

253
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,237
And a great kick.

254
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,405
>> Oh, slow down.

255
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,448
>> It's all right-- perfect.

256
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,241
>> PROBST: Nice shot by Kota.

257
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:12,575
>> Yes.

258
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,327
>> PROBST: Matty back with the

259
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,703
second shot for Fang.

260
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,579
>> No.

261
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,538
>> PROBST: And his shot goes

262
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,500
way left.

263
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,460
But it gets a pretty good

264
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,211
bounce.

265
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:23,836
Ends up about 20 yards from the

266
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,298
hole.

267
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,299
We are tied.

268
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,384
Two shots each.

269
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,804
Fang with their third shot.

270
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,515
Randy, way short.

271
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,644
Third shot for Kota.

272
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,770
Kenny's going to be the shooter

273
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,687
this time.

274
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,941
Could win the hole right here.

275
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,775
And he does it.

276
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,567
Kota scores the first point!

277
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:50,863
Moving on to the next hole.

278
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,697
Second hole.

279
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,700
225 yards, uphill.

280
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,579
>> One, two, three.

281
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,583
>> PROBST: Nice shot.

282
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,294
Just past the 125-yard marker.

283
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,504
>> Good job.

284
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,588
>> PROBST: Matty back shooting

285
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,758
now for Fang.

286
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:16,055
Nice shot from Fang.

287
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,057
Both balls very close.

288
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,018
Come on down.

289
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,520
Fang, you're furthest out.

290
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,398
You'll shoot first.

291
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,651
He lets it go.

292
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,610
Hits high on the mountain,

293
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,281
falls all the way down, just

294
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,032
six inches from the hole.

295
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:35,616
>> Whoo!

296
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,575
>> Nice, nice.

297
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,243
>> PROBST: Kota with their

298
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,288
second shot; got to get close.

299
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,831
Bob with a decent shot but

300
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,165
still about 30 feet away from

301
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:43,416
the hole.

302
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,375
>> That's all right.

303
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:44,959
We'll get it in.

304
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,335
We'll get it in.

305
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,086
>> PROBST: Kota with their

306
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:47,628
third shot.

307
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,964
Probably need to get this one

308
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,092
in the hole.

309
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:53,718
Kenny gives it a good shot, but

310
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,594
it's too long.

311
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,387
>> It's all right.

312
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,179
It's all right, Kenny.

313
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,139
>> PROBST: Fang now with their

314
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,473
third shot.

315
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,684
Fang needs this to stay alive.

316
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,602
>> Like that?

317
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,520
Go widen out, Charlie, widen

318
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:04,895
out.

319
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,646
>> Just not too much power.

320
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,606
>> Widen out.

321
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:10,901
>> That's it.

322
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,694
>> PROBST: And he does it.

323
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,030
Fang ties it up, 1-1.

324
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:17,908
This is it.

325
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,201
Final hole.

326
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,997
200 yards, uphill.

327
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,957
We are tied, one each.

328
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,085
Playing to two.

329
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,755
Matty launches one.

330
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,007
Gets a nice kick.

331
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,217
Dead center perfect.

332
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,720
Kota's up.

333
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,056
Bob launches.

334
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:40,765
>> Yeah.

335
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,767
>> PROBST: A huge drive.

336
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,560
Nice off the tee box for Kota.

337
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,102
Kota!

338
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,481
>> It's not about deuces.

339
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,983
>> PROBST: Matty, back.

340
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,403
Launches a nice one.

341
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,154
>> It's all right.

342
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:55,529
It's all right.

343
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,405
Come on, roll.

344
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,490
>> PROBST: Look at that, kicking

345
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,325
all the way back.

346
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,077
Decent shot by Fang, in good

347
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,994
shape.

348
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,079
Kota, you're up.

349
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,455
>> One, two, three.

350
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,082
>> PROBST: Bob launches.

351
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,209
Far to the right, but he's

352
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,543
getting a good kick.

353
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:09,919
>> Yes!

354
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,087
>> PROBST: Kota in pretty

355
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,423
decent shape.

356
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,050
Kota now up with their third

357
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,551
shot.

358
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,929
Winner of this hole wins reward.

359
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,103
Kenny just misses.

360
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,729
Six inches too far, rolls down

361
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,898
the hill, opens the door for

362
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,902
Fang.

363
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,405
He had to go short, and puts it

364
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,031
right on the edge of the hole.

365
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:39,865
>> Oh, my God.

366
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,534
>> PROBST: Big-time pressure on

367
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,077
Kota for this shot.

368
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,788
Kota, with their fourth shot,

369
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,416
knowing that Fang is literally

370
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,501
on the edge of the hole.

371
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,551
Kenny just overshoots it.

372
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,010
Matty can win it for Fang right

373
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:00,553
here.

374
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,554
>> Could.

375
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,138
>> Charlie, hold it out here.

376
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,973
>> Okay.

377
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:04,849
>> No rush, no rush.

378
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,350
>> Just drop it way out here,

379
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,726
Charlie.

380
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,436
>> Farther, farther.

381
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:08,978
Matty, don't pull it back.

382
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,605
Just set it forward...

383

00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:27,105
circles, like an idiot.

574
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,192
It's like one of the worst

575
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,193
feelings ever.

576
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,195
Wait, I know what to do.

577
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,822
(grunts)

578
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:35,447
I'm not an outdoors type of guy.

579
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,157
At home I usually sit in the

580
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,367
room playing video games most

581
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,744
of the time.

582
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,830
Uh-huh.

583
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,290
But right now, I'm feeling that

584
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,292
I... I'm getting to know how to

585
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,293
play this game more,

586
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,254
this game of <i>Survivor.</i>

587
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,256
Three fishes.

588
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,342
Three tilapias.

589
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,680
Oh, ladies!

590
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,557
Fried fish.

591
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,307
>> Awesome!

592
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,309
>> That is so cool, Kenny boy!

593
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,895
>> Bob's at Exile Island, so,

594
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,981
therefore, I'm the only man at

595
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,400
Kota with two very beautiful

596
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,235
women.

597
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,404
>> Thank you, Ken.

598
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,405
>> You did awesome!

599
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,197
>> Who would've thought the

600
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,490
little guy in this game would

601
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,533
be the provider for them.

602
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,534
>> This is good!

603
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,368
>> The best fish I've had out

604
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,369
here.

605
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,663
To me that's a Gabon feast for

606
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,664
me.

607
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,290
I am very proud of myself for

608
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,876
what I've done so far in this

609
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,878
game, and if people want to

610
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:31,461
take me out, I will take them

611
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,463
out before they take me out,

612
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,673
any way I can.

613
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,300
So, right now, I know for a fact

614
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,386
that I can win this game.

615
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,017

619
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,240
Well, I think I'll go for clue

620

two.

621
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,284
I just arrived at Exile and my

622
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,286
choice is not to take comfort.

623
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,247
I'm going to go for the clue and

624
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,166
that's a real clear choice for

625
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,044
me because I am, uh, in deep

Sandy crater.

628
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,467
Wow.

But I don't see it.

The first three clues came boom,

642
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,633
boom, boom.

643
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,926
And this one has got me

644
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,385
completely perplexed.

645
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,429
I can't think of a leaf that

646
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,181
I've left unturned.

647
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,849
I have been more than

648
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,059
frustrated.

649
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,269
Maybe Sugar found the idol.

650
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,187
I'm not exactly sure, but I've

651
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,232
got to do something.

652
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,194
My plan is to make something

653
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:19,695
that looks like an idol.

654
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,655
I found something that looked

655
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,447
like a skull, so I took the

656
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,783
resin that I found in one of

657
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,243
the trees and glued the front

658
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,911
of it with resin, and then taken

659
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,495
knick-knacks that I found

660
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,790
around.

661
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,546
This is my new fake idol.

662
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,380
I potentially have an idol

663
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,674
that could threaten somebody

664
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,800
else in the tribe.

665
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,301
It's sort of like when you're

666
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,553
holding up a bank; you don't

667
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,387
necessarily need the gun.

668
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,182
If they think you got a gun,

669
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,642
they might leave you alone.

670
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,570
>> We got mail!

671
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,573
>> "Today, it's not important

672
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,533
if you're fast or stronger or

673
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:06,742
smarter.

674
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,746
To avoid going home tonight,

675
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,496
be the best fire starter."

676
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,582
>> It's individual, it sounds

677
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:13,790
like.

678
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,751
>> Oh, God, I hope not.

679
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,127
>> We don't know! Shush up!

680
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,421
>> It said build a fire?

681
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,423
>> No, Crystal... there's no way

682
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,799
Crystal is gonna start a fire.

683
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,884
There's no way Susie's gonna

684
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,260
be able to start a fire.

685
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,344
There's no way Kenny is.

686
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:26,928
>> They could give Crystal a

687
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:27,596
book of matches and gasoline,

688
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,848
and she can't start a fire.

689
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,933
We don't know if it's gonna be

690
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,226
tribe versus tribe or whether

691
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,227
it's gonna be individual

692
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,271
immunity, but there's a merge.

693
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,898
And I see Crystal again, I'll

694
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:38,565
puke.

695
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,399
I mean, can you imagine the

696
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,443
drama if the merge happens and

697
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,070
I was forced to stay with

698
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,529
Sasquatch, and you know...

699
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,116
>> Sasquatch is Bigfoot, which

700
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,825
is Crystal.

701
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,827
>> Okay.

702
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,703
>> Which is also T-Rex.

703
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,746
I hated Crystal from the

704
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,205
beginning.

705
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:53,830
Everybody knows that.

706
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,083
She made her bed back in the old

707
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,001
Fang, and I still hold a major

708
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,171
grudge.

709
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:10,347
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

710
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,806
We'll now bring in Bob

711
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,809
returning from Exile Island.

712
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,273
First things first, Matty, we'll

713
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,442
take back the immunity idol.

714
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,448
Once again, immunity is back up

715
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,117
for grabs.

716
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,868
Today, tribal immunity is not

717
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,496
what you seek.

718
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,581
Individual immunity is what you

719
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,834
are playing for...

720
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,418
because you are no longer two

721
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,671
tribes.

722
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:44,631
Drop your buffs.

723
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,341
You are merged.

724
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:46,675
(Sugar squeals)

725
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,553
>> Yes! Awesome!

726
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,221
>> Whoa!

727
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,889
>> The merge is a new lease on

728
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,850
life for me.

729
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,852
I knew my days were numbered.

730
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,229
I'm the luckiest guy in Gabon.

731
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,814
>> Are you okay?

732
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,524
>> Yeah, I missed you so much.

733
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,526
My buddy!

734
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,986
>> PROBST: Matty, here are your

735
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:06,945
buffs.

736
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,156
Pass them out. Put 'em on.

737
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,783
>> Oh, my God, it's so clean.

738
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,954
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

739
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,122
ready to get to your challenge?

740
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:17,747
>> Yes.

741
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,123
>> Let's do it.

742
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:18,707
>> PROBST: It is only fitting,

743
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,126
as you now enter the individual

744
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,919
portion of this game, that the

745
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,546
first challenge should test how

746
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,340
well you would do on your own.

747
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,009
Today you will make fire.

748
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,552
You will each have a flint and

749
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,345
steel and a box of fire-making

750
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:32,721
supplies.

751
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,182
Your goal: make a fire high

752
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,558
enough to burn through your

753
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,684
rope.

754
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,686
First person to burn through

755
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,356
their rope wins immunity and

756
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,525
guaranteed a one-in-eight shot

757
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,653
at a million bucks.

somebody will be voted out and

become the second member of our

00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:54,743
jury.

763
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,535
High enough stakes?

764
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,245
>> Yes.

765
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,371
>> Yes.

766
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,331
>> PROBST: All right, we'll draw

767
00:24:59,414 --> 00:24:59,748
for positions.

768
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,459
We'll get started.

769
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,755
Okay, you each have a flint and

770
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,006
steel.

771
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,633
You got fire-making supplies.

772
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,884
Everything you've had at camp

773
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,469
from day one.

774
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,970
This is for immunity.

775
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,307
Survivors ready?

776
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,810
Go.

777
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,938
Let's see what you've learned

778
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,608
in your 27 days in Gabon, West

779
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,485
Africa.

780
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,611
This is fundamental to being

781
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,656
able to survive on your own.

782
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,449
And you are on your own in this

783
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,742
game now.

784
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:39,162
Randy trying to get a spark.

785
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:41,706
Bob really trying to get

786
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,708
something sparking down there.

787
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,128
Susie looking for a spark.

788
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,299
Randy just starting over.

789
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,676
(blowing)

790
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,761
>> Come on, baby.

791
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,720
Come on, come on.

792
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,888
>> PROBST: Susie first to get

793
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,141
flame.

794
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:00,725
>> Come on, baby, come on.

795
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,602
>> PROBST: Using that husk to

796
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:02,978
get it burning.

797
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,688
Now she's got to get something

798
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,232
that she can keep going.

799
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,611
Matty with a little injury,

800
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,696
making no progress at all.

801
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,448
Susie working hard to build a

802
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,741
little teepee.

803
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,910
>> Come on, baby.

804
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,212
>> PROBST: Sugar has flame.

805
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,589
Trying to turn it into a fire

806
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,175
that will sustain itself, start

807
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,635
to grow.

808
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,346
Sugar and Susie both with fire.

809
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:38,972
Somebody else better get in this

810
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,516
challenge.

811
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,767
(groans)

812
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,688
Sugar coming on strong now.

813
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,064
>> Come on.

814
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,859
>> So close.

815
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,360
>> PROBST: Susie's fire

816
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,070
continues to grow.

817
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,697
Nobody else is even in it.

818
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,824
>> This sucks!

819
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:58,742
>> PROBST: Sugar with a very

820
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,161
impressive fire.

821
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,579
If somebody doesn't hurry up,

822
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,997
Sugar and Susie are going to be

823
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,290
tough to beat.

824
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,541
>> There we go. There we go.

825
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,334
>> PROBST: They're neck and

826
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,836
neck.

827
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,379
>> Come on, come on, come on.

828
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,297
>> PROBST: Susie getting very

829
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,923
close now.

830
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,301
Sugar looking very good.

831
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,052
>> There we go.

832
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,094
Now let's get some flames on

833
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:18,678
the... come on, baby.

834
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,804
>> PROBST: Susie's fire is

835
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,765
starting to burn high enough

836
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,434
now to burn through that rope.

837
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,769
Sugar's fire is up to the rope.

838
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,647
Both in good position.

839
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,153
>> Yes!

840
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,988
>> PROBST: Susie wins immunity!

841
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,324
>> I can't believe it!

842
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,658
>> Congratulations.

843
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,495
>> Thank you.

844
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,872
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

845
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,957
Susie is safe tonight at Tribal

846
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,167
Council.

847
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,210
(applause)

848
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,836
Guaranteed a one-in-eight shot

849
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,505
at a million dollars.

850
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,130
For the rest of you, one of you

851
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,882
going home tonight.

852
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,717
You will now return to one camp

853
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,511
together.

854
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,887
You will be going back to what

855
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,347
was formally Fang.

856
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,265
It is now a new camp.

857
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:04,808
You will have everything you

858
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,726
need there to give yourself a

859
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,019
new tribe name, build a new

860
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,104
tribe flag.

861
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,939
Any personal items, any reward

862
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,774
items left back at the old Kota

863
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,317
camp will be waiting there for

864
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:14,984
you.

865
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,152
Grab your stuff.

866
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:16,945
Head back to camp.

867
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:17,320
See you at Tribal.

868
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,446
Congratulations.

869
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,865
>> Thanks, Jeff.

870
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:21,783
>> Finally, we merged, just

871
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,952
everybody together, nine of us.

872
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,621
But I hated Fang from the

873
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,455
beginning.

874
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,748
There's no way I'm going back

875
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,083
to camp tonight with Crystal.

876
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,168
She'll be gone or I'll be gone.

877
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:43,805
(trumpeting)

878
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,973
>> Good to be here.

879
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,474
>> Welcome back.

880
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,060
Congratulations, everyone.

881
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,103
I can't believe we've got

882
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:50,478
canned food here.

883
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:50,979
That must be our beans.

884
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,981
>> I think it's rice.

885
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:53,773
>> Oh, good!

886
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,901
>> Beans or beanie weenie.

887
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,319
>> Yeah, let's eat it.

888
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,612
>> The merge totally changed the

889
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,196
game.

890
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,322
We got back, everybody paid

891
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,782
homage to all our new gifts.

892
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,242
There was rice; there was

893
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,244
canned food; there was beans.

894
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:06,828
There was Gabon pears.

895
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,080
There's coffee.

896
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:09,789
But, uh, as soon as that little

897
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,916
brief gratitude session was

898
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,419
up...

899
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,920
>> Want to go to the woods?

900
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:16,796
>> ...people bounced into the

901
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,090
jungle and started their

902
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,675
strategies, you know.

903
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,094
(exhales sharply)

904
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,098
>> Crystal's the way to go,

905
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:27,807
and I'm voting for Crystal.

906
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,767
Don't worry.

907
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,226
Bob will vote Crystal.

908
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,187
>> Yeah, the four of us are on

909
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,396
board for Crystal, so we just

910
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,272
need Sugar.

911
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,523
I feel very confident that

912
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,816
Corinne, Bob, Randy, and I are

913
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,861
a solid four, and I feel

914
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,614
confident that Matty, Kenny,

915
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,948
Susie, and Crystal are a solid

916
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,034
four.

917
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:46,868
Then, there's Sugar.

918
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,245
>> ♪ Hallelujah. ♪

919
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,038
>> And she is hanging somewhere

920
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,081
in the middle, and she has ties

921
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,333
to both sides.

922
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,834
But Sugar has a mind of her

923
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,169
own and is playing this game

924
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,422
very differently than all of us.

925
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,301
(squeals)

926
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:17,941
>> Are we on board?

927
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,318
>> Yeah, I'm...

928
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,903
I can't live with him anymore,

929
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,196
and he's going to cause big

930
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:23,905
problems.

931
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,241
>> We can do Randy next.

932
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,327
>> That's what I was saying.

933
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,828
I mean, I want you to be

934
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,412
comfortable, so I care about

935
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,081
your opinion.

936
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,500
My whole plan is just to stay

937
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,084
on Sugar because she... she is

938
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,835
the swing vote.

939
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,128
Not only do I have to act

940
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,171
interested in what Sugar is

941
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,506
saying, but I have to act like I

942
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:45,343
care about her.

943
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,803
>> Honestly, will you trust me?

944
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,929
Like, it's the best move.

945
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,180
>> I just know Randy is in a bad

946
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,473
spot and he has to stick with

947
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,099
us, and I just want to stay in

948
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,850
the game.

949
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,060
>> It's the Kota foursome to

950
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:54,936
the end.

951
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,938
>> Sugar is so weak and naive

952
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,148
and gullible.

953
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,275
I have been nasty to her for 25

954
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:00,984
days.

955
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,361
I was nice to her one day, and

956
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,529
she's sold.

957
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,863
So it doesn't even make sense,

958
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,447
but she buys it because she's

959
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,157
such a moron.

960
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,909
(trumpets)

961
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,369
>> Now, listen, listen, Charlie

962
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,205
and Corinne are the alliance.

963
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,832
>> They never, ever, ever break.

964
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,624
>> So we need to break them.

965
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,417
>> No, I'm going to tell you

966
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:17,959
right now.

967
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,210
Me and... we home, we home.

968
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,420
This is some real... this is the

969
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,296
realness over here.

970
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,547
>> Randy is with Kota, too.

971
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,464
>> Okay, if he's Kota, then

972
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,465
you're on their chopping list.

973
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,216
>> Why?

974
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,175
>> 'Cause Randy.

975
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,176
>> Yeah, yeah.

976
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,553
>> No, but listen...

977
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,178
>> But they... them two got's to

978
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:29,929
be broken up.

979
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,431
>> Which one?

980
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,348
>> Corinne and Charlie.

981
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,391
>> Oh, they both need to go.

982
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,892
Corinne can go first.

983
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:35,518
>> See, Corinne is just hurting

984
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:35,977
herself with her own

985
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,437
personality.

986
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,521
>> Oh, God, she's horrendous!

987
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,480
I can't handle her.

988
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,857
She is awful, dude.

989
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,524
>> (laughing): I know.

990
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,570
>> No, really.

991
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,070
>> Yeah, what about...?

992
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,864
>> I have a personal grudge

993
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,364
against Charlie.

994
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,574
At that feast, freaking Charlie

995
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,075
took that paper and he made me

996
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,201
share it with everybody.

997
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,286
I could have gotten the hidden

998
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,203
immunity idol, and nobody would

999
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,455
have known, but no.

1000
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,873
So I made up this little lie.

1001
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:57,498
I said, "Charlie, he's behind

1002
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,124
the scenes of Kota.

1003
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,209
He's telling people what to do."

1004
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,878
But really, no, I made it up,

1005
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,046
and everybody listened to me.

1006
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,047
>> Write down Charlie.

1007
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,881
Write down Charlie, Charlie.

1008
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:05,882
>> Charlie.

1009
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:06,507
>> Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

1010
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,425
>> I'll trade that idol for his

1011
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,426
life.

1012
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,010
Serves him right.

1013
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:09,552
We got to blindside Charlie

1014
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:09,969
first.

1015
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,012
I'm like a little rat.

1016
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,931
I go... you know, in the corner,

1017
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,183
and nobody knows that.

1018
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,476
You mess with me, then you're

1019
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,770
gone in this game.

1020
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,195
Charlie is the brains behind the

1021
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,196
whole Kota cabana.

1022
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:28,988
>> Really, it's not...?

1023
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:29,947
>> It's not Randy and not

1024
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,949
Corinne.

1025
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:32,992
We will get rid of them as soon

1026
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,619
as we can, but Charlie tells

1027
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,995
them what to do and he's the

1028
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,705
brains behind it.

1029
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,123
Yes, but he seems nice, but he

1030
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,626
goes out and talks and whispers

1031
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,919
to them, and then they... they

1032
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:43,753
be themselves.

1033
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,754
>> Okay.

1034
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,963
>> So once we get rid of

1035
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:46,881
Charlie, we can get rid of

1036
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:47,465
Randy, Corinne, whoever you

1037
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,466
want.

1038
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,050
>> I think I'm the lady of the

1039
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,845
hour because everybody is

1040
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,138
telling me who to vote for and

1041
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,431
chomping at the bit to, like,

1042
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,433
get my vote for somebody.

1043
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,059
Just "You got to vote with us.

1044
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,060
Get the numbers, blah, blah,

1045
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,437
blah."

1046
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,064
So we have to come up with a

1047
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:07,026
tribe name?

1048
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,319
>> N-O-B-A-G.

1049
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,320
>> I like that.

1050
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,906
Gabon backwards.

1051
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:13,116
>> The thing is, I don't trust

1052
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,117
Kenny.

1053
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,494
He lied to me about Ace.

1054
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,162
So he could be some evil

1055
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,247
mastermind.

1056
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,623
And I don't trust Crystal at

1057
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,916
all.

1058
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,710
I certainly don't have any

1059
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,670
allegiance to Randy and Corinne.

1060
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,213
So I guess I don't trust any of

1061
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,966
these guys.

1062
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:30,967
>> Are we good?

1063
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,968
>> Sure.

1064
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,178
>> Wait-- yeah, yeah, wherever.

1065
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,263
>> I think that's good.

1066
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,723
>> Even though we're one tribe,

1067
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,433
there is definitely two sides to

1068
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,018
this tribe, and both sides of

1069
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,604
this blue tribe want my vote for

1070
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,691
another person, so I have no

1071
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,443
clue what to do, but I don't owe

1072
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,029
anything to anybody at all.

1073
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:56,325
♪ ♪

1074
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,547
>> PROBST: Now I'll bring in the

1075
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,382
first member of our jury.

1076
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,387
Marcus, voted out at the last

1077
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,639
Tribal Council.

1078
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,311
So I'll remind you guys, from

1079
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,855
this point forward, no talking

1080
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,939
to the jury.

1081
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:27,440
They're here to observe.

1082
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,316
That's it.

1083
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,694
The game is slowly shifting into

1084
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,030
their hands.

1085
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,656
All right, let's start at the

1086
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,199
reward challenge.

1087
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,493
Randy, you guys are right on the

1088
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,202
verge of winning this challenge.

1089
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,245
All you have to do, literally,

1090
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,330
is just pick up the ball and

1091
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,498
drop it in.

1092
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,874
Where was all that tension

1093
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:45,500
coming from when you're on the

1094
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,460
verge of a win?

1095
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,129
>> Uh, the shot that Matty took,

1096
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,964
he would make nine times out of

1097
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:52,965
ten.

1098
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,134
If everybody would have shut up

1099
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,427
and listened to what I was

1100
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,970
saying, I had a shot that would

1101
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,138
have made it ten times out of

1102
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,139
ten.

1103
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,432
Nobody would listen, and it was

1104
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,517
frustrating.

1105
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,518
>> PROBST: Charlie, you were

1106
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,560
seeing that the tribe was

1107
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,311
starting to break down and maybe

1108
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,605
on the verge of blowing an easy

1109
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,606
win.

1110
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,649
>> Yeah, I was screaming over

1111
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,233
both of them, "Calm down. Calm

1112
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,069
down. Let's communicate" because

1113
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:13,694
to express your point of view,

1114
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,655
you need to communicate it, and

1115
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,781
I think the communication really

1116
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,158
broke down, so I hope we learned

1117
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,159
from it.

1118
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,953
>> PROBST: Randy, you started

1119
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,663
off on Fang tribe, you went over

1120
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,039
to Kota, and from that point

1121
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,624
forward what I've seen has been,

1122
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,917
"Don't miss 'em.

1123
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,918
Didn't like 'em anyway."

1124
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:29,585
>> Well, since we're putting

1125
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,879
stuff out on the table, why, why

1126
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:32,463
have you got issues with me?

1127
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,215
>> Why?

1128
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,508
>> Why do you have issues with

1129
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,509
Crystal?

1130
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,927
Yes, I would like to know.

1131
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,427
If I have a problem with

1132
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,013
anybody, it's clear.

1133
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:41,514
It's not any gray area.

1134
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,432
This is where Crystal stands.

1135
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,433
>> Okay, w-why...?

1136
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,476
>> W-W-Wait, I let you finish.

1137
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,269
Let me finish.

1138
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:46,769
>> I never even started.

1139
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,479
How can you let me finish?

1140
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,522
>> You're opening up your mouth.

1141
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,773
Let me finish.

1142
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,358
Now, what is it that I did to

1143
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,068
Randy for Randy to be bashing

1144
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,820
Crystal so much at Kota camp?

1145
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:56,362
>> Okay, you want a list?

1146
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,322
>> What'd I do to Randy, really?

1147
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,156
>> All right.

1148
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,074
The first nine days of this

1149
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,075
game...

1150
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,076
>> Mm-hmm.

1151
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,995
>> ...you made Fang a living

1152
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:04,537
hell, you and your boy GC.

1153
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,288
>> Okay...

1154
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,330
>> You guys were running...

1155
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,248
Hey, I let you talk.

1156
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,332
You going to let me talk or

1157
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,333
what?

1158
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,002
>> Speak on.

1159
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:11,669
>> All right.

1160
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,589
You and your posse ran the tribe

1161
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,007
like it was a gang.

1162
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,550
When you guys had power, you

1163
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,217
guys were arrogant; you were

1164
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,303
hard to get along with.

1165
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,763
You were causing the division in

1166
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,389
our tribe and were the reason

1167
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,224
that we lost all those times.

1168
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,768
>> All right, okay.

1169
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,978
>> Y-You, you want more?

1170
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,271
>> You feel like you have to say

1171
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,606
some more, we ain't got nothing

1172
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:36,360
but time.

1173
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,195
>> PROBST: Crystal, you've been

1174
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,989
pretty vocal, sharing what's on

1175
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,407
your mind at times.

1176
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,783
Ever regret any of your emotions

1177
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,784
out here?

1178
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,785
>> No, I don't.

1179
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,287
Yeah, I've cried when I've won.

1180
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,455
I've cried when I lost.

1181
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,414
I've been called delusional.

1182
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,458
But you can guarantee one thing:

1183
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,459
this is Crystal.

1184
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,543
What you see is what you get,

1185
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,378
and if you want the truth, this

1186
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,379
is Crystal.

1187
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,464
>> PROBST: Charlie, would you be

1188
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,925
a little concerned if you were

1189
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,718
Randy or Crystal, people who

1190
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,553
have been the most vocal tonight

1191
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,722
firing arrows back and forth?

1192
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,348
>> I think that if you're just

1193
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,516
saying something just for your

1194
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,935
own selfish reasons to get it

1195
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:09,477
off your chest, that doesn't

1196
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,436
make sense.

1197
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,354
I definitely think you need to

1198
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,438
process what comes out of your

1199
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,982
mouth, especially in this unique

1200
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:15,983
circumstance.

1201
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,567
>> PROBST: Kenny, the nine of

1202
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,402
you, who have been battling for

1203
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,529
so long, now come together.

1204
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,365
Do opinions start to change?

1205
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,283
>> Well, like, with Charlie, for

1206
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,993
instance, I didn't know too much

1207
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,745
about Charlie, and I like

1208
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,746
Charlie.

1209
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,830
Just talking with him, I know

1210
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,540
that he's a nice guy.

1211
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,541
>> PROBST: Charlie, has your

1212
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,292
opinion of Kenny changed now

1213
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:33,918
that you've spent some time with

1214
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:34,460
him?

1215
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,045
>> Not at all.

1216
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,129
I thought Kenny was a great guy

1217
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,048
when I met him, so my opinion

1218
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:39,632
has stayed the same and I've

1219
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,341
continued to develop a

1220
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,426
friendship with Kenny.

1221
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,719
>> PROBST: Randy, is there

1222
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,345
anybody that changed for you?

1223
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:48,140
>> Yeah, Kenny, he's, he's, he's

1224
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,266
not a little kid anymore.

1225
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,309
He's definitely grown up and

1226
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,895
that's not the Kenny I saw weeks

1227
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,896
ago.

1228
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,856
>> PROBST: Let's talk about your

1229
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,399
time out here, Sugar.

1230
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,609
Can it actually be an advantage

1231
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,152
to have spent so many times away

1232
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,779
from the game on Exile because

1233
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,905
you didn't have the same

1234
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,532
opportunity to irritate people

1235
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,034
that Randy did and Crystal did?

1236
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,411
>> Um, being away from everybody

1237
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,954
just gives them a chance to talk

1238
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,372
about me more.

1239
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,456
I would not annoy everybody.

1240
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,375
I don't hurt people's feelings

1241
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,669
and I don't talk crap about

1242
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,171
people behind their backs and I

1243
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,631
have a good idea of who

1244
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,384
everybody is.

1245
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,469
>> PROBST: All right, Susie, you

1246
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,345
have individual immunity unless

1247
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,389
you want to assign that to

1248
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,390
someone else.

1249
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,433
>> Let me think about that.

1250
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,726
(laughter)

1251
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,060
Nope, I'm gonna keep it.

1252
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,103
>> PROBST: All right, you cannot

1253
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:34,687
vote for Susie.

1254
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,230
Everybody else is fair game.

1255
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:37,273
It is time to vote.

1256
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,524
Randy, you're up.

1257
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,619
>> (whispering): Bitch.

1258
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:15,227
>> (whispering): Sorry, Charlie.

1259
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,612
>> (whispering): You took out my

1260
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,031
Marcus, and that makes me really

1261
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,116
mad.

1262
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,265
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1263
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,518
votes.

1264
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,774
If anybody has the hidden

1265
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,067
immunity idol and you want to

1266
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,485
play it, now would be the time

1267
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,613
to do so.

1268
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,614
Okay.

1269
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,532
Once the votes are read, the

1270
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,491
decision is final.

1271
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,033
The person voted out will be

1272
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,368
asked to leave the Tribal

1273
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,869
Council area immediately.

1274
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:18,082
I'll read the votes.

1275
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:23,045
First vote: Crystal.

1276
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,214
Who cast this vote?

1277
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,298
>> Uh, C.C., Crystal Cox.

1278
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,341
>> PROBST: If you don't want

1279
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:28,259
somebody to know who you voted

1280
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,343
for, you got to write a name

1281
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:30,344
down.

1282
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:30,845
Otherwise I have to ask.

1283
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:35,599
That's two votes Crystal.

1284
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,642
Crystal.

1285
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:42,439
Three votes Crystal.

1286
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,440
Crystal.

1287
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,693
Four votes Crystal.

1288
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,865
Charlie.

1289
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,283
Four votes Crystal;

1290
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:56,287
one vote Charlie.

1291
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,288
Charlie.

1292
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:57,705
Four votes Crystal;

1293
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,624
two votes Charlie.

1294
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,879
Charlie.

1295
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,255
That's four votes Crystal;

1296
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,716
three votes Charlie.

1297
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,718
Charlie.

1298
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,927
Four votes Crystal;

1299
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:12,678
four votes Charlie.

1300
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,222
One vote left.

1301
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,977
Tenth person voted out of

1302
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,644
<i>Survivor: Gabon </i>and the second

1303
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:26,483
member of our jury: Charlie.

1304
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,652
You need to bring me your torch.

1305
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,738
>> Good job, guys.

1306
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,453
>> PROBST: Charlie, the tribe

1307
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,582
has spoken.

1308
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,625
Time for you to go.

1309
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,711
>> Have fun.

1310
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,342
>> PROBST: One thing tonight's

1311
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,093
Tribal Council made clear to me

1312
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,553
is that the merge has had an

1313
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,388
impact on this game, and it

1314
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,807
should make for a crazy finish.

1315
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,808
Grab your torches.

1316
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,809
Head back to camp.

1317
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,937
Good night.

1324
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:19,870
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1325
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,081
from our next episode.

1326
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,583
>> PROBST: Next time on

1327
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,584
<i>Survivor.</i>

1328
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,294
>> I'm gonna burn this house

1329
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,295
down.

1330
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,004
>> PROBST: Randy stirs up the

1331
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,005
camp.

1332
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:30,589
>> He is wreaking havoc.

1333
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,423
>> I think he's crazy.

1334
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,007
>> You're on the outs.

1335
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,092
The final three in this game is

1336
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,093
Kenny, Susie, and Crystal.

1337
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,010
You're not part of it.

1338
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:35,678
>> We have to get this right.

1339
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,136
If we get this right,

1340
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,471
the whole game will change.

1341
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:38,097
>> PROBST: But Kenny will not be

1342
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,641
denied.

1343
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,818
>> Okay, this is a disaster.

1344
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:55,322
I 100% did not see this coming.

1345
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,615
But what can you do at this

1346
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,616
point?

1347
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,659
And I didn't think I would make

1348
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,119
it past the first Tribal, so to

1349
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,495
make it this far is amazing.

1350
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:03,163
If I'm going to leave <i>Survivor,</i>

1351
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,081
I'm glad it's a blindside.

1352
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:04,707
Thank God Marcus is in the jury

1353
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,958
house.

1354
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,042
That is my saving grace.
