So, I got this little necklace.

331
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,861
LINDSAY:
Oh, I didn't see the face side.

332

-Mm-hmm.

<i>MARYA:</i>
<i>Losing him-- it's indescribable.</i>

338
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,345
I've been holding my breath
for a year

339
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,781
because my kids are home,
you know,

340
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,517

to be the-the strong mom

341
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,286
<i>that keeps it all together.</i>

342
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,454
<i>So being here on</i> Survivor
<i>is about closure.</i>

343
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:27,693
<i>And for me, that would be worh</i>
<i>more than a million dollar.</i>

344
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,701
-Where was it?
-It was on the side
of the road.

345
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,935
What did it look like?

346
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,038
It's exactly what the idol
looks like you see on TV.

347
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,839
<i>Coming into this season,</i>
<i>I swore to myself</i>

348
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,675
<i>that I would not tell anybody</i>
<i>if I found an idol.</i>

349
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,144
<i>But me not having a vote--</i>
<i>it changes everything.</i>

350
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,613
So I decided to tell Jenny

351
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,782
<i>because she's my strongest ally</i>
<i>out here right now.</i>

352

<i>My number one.</i>

353
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:55,821
-I found it.
-Holy ..., man.

354
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,057
But it's not an immunity idol.

355
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,562
<i>I also want to try and gain an</i>
<i>ally, somebody smart to help me,</i>

356
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,731

<i>Daniel is a no-brainer.</i>

357
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,167
Okay.

358
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,013
Okay.

359
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,486
Hey, there was a "Y"
in the road.

360
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,921
I said,
"Let me check the 'Y' out."

361
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,656

362
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,257

<i>and now I can't find it.</i>

364
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,195
I can't lose an idol,
and what do I do?

365
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,629
I mean, I got...
I don't remember

367
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,101

<i>DANIEL:</i>
<i>Mike buried it</i>

<i>20 million trails here. I am</i>

370
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,083

-That's what I'm trying...

372

<i>Mike has lost his vote.</i>

374
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,004
<i>That's a pretty,</i>

375
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,073
I have the mind for the numbers,
I think, between the two of us.

376
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,142
And so, I'm basically going

377
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,676
to help him
figure out how to play this.

378
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,984
-Yeah, great, but it's on me.
-This was a... this was...

00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,544
It's fun to say, not fun
when you think about it.

823
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,812
No. Not at all.

824
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,046
Mm-mm.

825
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,314
PROBST:
Omar, as much excitement
as I saw,

826
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,416
even on your face
when you walked in here,

827
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,685
this is where death happens.

828
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,253
Yeah, I mean,
as a fan of the show,

829
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,355
coming to Tribal Council,
it's unbelievable.

830
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,258
But on the other hand,
there's the horrible side

831
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,728
that we have to cut
a family member loose tonight.

832
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:58,863
And this truly is a family

833
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,264
after five days.

834
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,866
MARYA:
Absolutely.

835
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,602
I mean, we've shared
a lot together in five days.

836
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,604
Like, I know their stories.

837
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,672
PROBST:
Omar, that's really interesting

838
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,341
because the bookend
to coming out here

839
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,543
and feeling like
you can bond with people

840
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,980
is that now you feel
some level of moral obligation

841
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,549
to be a little more honest
than you might want to be.

842
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,184
-Yeah.
-PROBST: But you can't be
too honest.

843
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,119
Yeah, like, you don't want
to lie to their face,

844
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,723
but at the same it's like
Darwin's theory of evolution.

845
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,859
Like, there's a selection
pressure on us now,

846
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,794
especially with
the Shot in the Dark,

847
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,563
where everybody has to think
that they're safe,

848
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,465
but not everybody's
going to be safe.

849
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,401
Jonathan,
if it's a natural selection,

850
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,003
or if it's
survival of the fittest,

851
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,371
you're basically saying,

852
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,374
how do I make sure
I don't come back here?

853
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,143
By keeping the people
who are with me

854
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,478
strong enough to win challenges.

855
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,579
-That's really it.
-JONATHAN: Right.

856
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,249
Yeah, and, like,
strength in this game

857
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,218
comes in all different shapes
and forms.

858
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,287
You know,
physical strength is one thing,

859
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,122
mental strength is another.

860
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,392
Social game is another.
All connected is what you need.

861
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,861
-You can't just have one.
-I agree.

862
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,563
But, Lindsay,
what's interesting about that,

863
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,031
there are five people

864
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,332
who all believe

865
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,334
that you'll be stronger
after this vote.

866
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,903
LINDSAY:
That's the hard part,

867
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,739
because obviously it's only
going to end up being four.

868
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:18,175
It's trying to be
as level-headed as you can

869
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,044
to balance out your paranoia

870
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,846
with your trust of who you have

871
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,681
and hope it works out.

872
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,182
PROBST:
Maryanne, was there much talk

873
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,350
of Shot in the Dark?

874
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,053
I feel as if it's always
in the back of our heads,

875
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,122
you know, 'cause that now adds
another layer to the strategy.

876
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:34,759
So it's, like, do you now go
with Plan A, B, C, then D,

877
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:38,396
or Plan A Subsection A,
Plan B Subsection B?

878
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,531
And then, if two people use it,
then you have now

879
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,867
another subsection,
and then another, and another.

880
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,602
You just have so many things
that you're thinking about.

881
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,204
Like, "Oh, my G." It's, like,
so easy to just kind of go,

882
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,739
like... (ululating)

883
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,575
When just one little
measly thing,

884
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,276
which is, like, this tiny.

885
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,547
Wow. So, Maryanne,
let's say it's you.

886
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:01,118
That big smile, that big laugh,
full of emotion.

887
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,587
What's the reaction?

888
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,655
I think right now,
going to Tribal, is

889
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,724
when I just realized, "Oh,

890
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,893
I'm actually playing<i> Survivor."</i>

891
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,028
And it's like, I want
to do more and learn more

892
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,231
with my tribe members.
Like, don't send me to Zach.

893
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,433
I'm not ready. Please.

894
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,602
-(Maryanne laughs)
-PROBST: So love really is

895
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,370
on your mind right now, right?

896
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,504
(laughter)

897
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,506
Well, you brought it up
twice today.

898
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,376
It's like, being 23 and, like,
always single, it's like,

899
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,111
maybe there's something wrong
with you

900
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,113
because no one romantically
likes you, you know?

901
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,514
And it's like, it's something

902
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,350
which I've always
been working on, and

903
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,585
the thing is, like,
Zachary-- literally

904
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,954
picture perfect. And I'm like,
"Hey, God, is that you?" Like,

905
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,556
wow, is this like a two-for-one?

906
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,257
You win<i> Survivor,</i>
and then you also get a man?

907
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,259
And then it's like in the
reunion, Jeff's like, "Yeah,

908
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,795
Maryanne, so you started to
date Zach. How'd that work out?"

909
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,465
And I'm like, "Well, Jeff, thank
you for putting me on Season 42.

910
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,400
It's a whole big side."

911
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,535
But, like, you know,
it's like, even though the part

912
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,371
of the game is about winning,
you still think

913
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,307
about the little things, too.

914
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,209
Oh, I was just
getting comfortable.

915
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,311
Oh, you want me...?
I can go more. I-I love

916
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,913
-saying my piece.
-(laughter)

917
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,815
PROBST:
Okay, so Marya,

918
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,317
you talked about getting
to know everybody.

919
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,752
There's a perfect example.

920
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,087
She's been very open
about sharing

921
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,657
-how she's looking for love.
-(Maryanne laughs)

922
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:16,327
And yet, if the vote goes
the wrong way for her tonight,

923
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,896
it means, "Yeah, we like you
and we hope you find love,

924
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,598
but we don't want you
on the tribe."

925
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,334
MARYA:
Yeah, I mean,
it would be very hard.

926
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:28,039
However, part of my journey
here is to stop being the mom

927
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,774
and the caretaker,
'cause that's what I do.

928
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,275
I have to make sure

929
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,377
everybody else is taken care of,
and part of

930
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,680
what I want to accomplish here
is to put me first.

931
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:39,183
So, I need to put Marya first
for once.

932
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,385
PROBST:
So, Lindsay,
how do you vote out Marya

933
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,120
when she says, "Look,
I'm gonna take care of me.

934
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,522
I got some more journey I need"?

935
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,357
LINDSAY:
No matter who we vote out,

936
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,792
it's going
to be extremely difficult,

937
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,960
but you have to kind of balance

938
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,363
the personal relationships
that you gain

939
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,366
and then your game
and what you want for yourself.

940
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,035
And you want to make sure
one doesn't overlap the other.

941
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,371
JONATHAN:
Absolutely, there's a line.
It's like,

942
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:04,141
I love everybody,
but there's a game to be played.

943
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,876
I mean, it's that simple.

944
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,144
PROBST:
Wow.

945
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,546
It's that simple.

946
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,716
On that note,
it is time to vote.

993
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,098
Yo, I got bait-and-switched.

<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>The idol</i>

995
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,235
is missing.

996
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,536
<i>I almost stroked out</i>
<i>right there.</i>

997
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,441
Hey, both tribes!

998
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,478
Never done this
in the history of<i> Survivor.</i>

My brother would tell me
that he's very proud of me,

1000
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,886

<i>and to keep living.</i>

1001
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,254
<i>You know, take risks</i>

1002
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,423
<i>and-and push myself</i>
<i>outside of my comfort zone.</i>

1003
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,825
<i>I had a lot of fun playing</i>
Survivor.

1004
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,460
<i>I got a lot in five days.</i>

1005
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,230
Survivor<i> is like parenting.</i>
<i>It's super hard.</i>

1006
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,798
<i>And yet I love it</i>

1007
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,301
in every possible way.
