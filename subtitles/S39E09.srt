1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:18,059
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS REALLY
HARD, AND I FELL VERY ALONE.

2
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,562
THERE WAS A MOMENT THERE WHERE I
DIDN'T KNOW IF I WANTED TO STAY

3
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,771
IN THE GAME.

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,483
BUT FOR ME QUITTING IS NOT AN
OPTION BECAUSE I DON'T WANT MY

5
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:31,740
DAUGHTERS AND GRANDDAUGHTERS TO
SEE THAT.

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,657
AND MY HUSBAND.

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,074
AND MY BEACH FAMILY.

8
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:33,616
I DON'T QUIT.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,994
I DON'T QUIT ANYTHING.

10
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,497
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FROM
HERE.

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,166
>> YOU CAN'T REGRET WHAT YOU
DID.

12
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:45,003
>> I DON'T REGRET WHAT I DID,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

13
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,254
I'M A FREE AGENT.

14
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:50,049
I PLAYED MY IDOL BECAUSE IT WAS
A CRAZY TRIBAL DIRECTED AT ME.

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:55,013
I WISH I STILL HAD IT, BECAUSE
I'M ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

16
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,099
THEY WANT ME GONE.

17
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,059
>> TAKE IT DAY BY DAY.

18
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:00,727
>> YEAH.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,145
I'M GRATEFUL FOR ANOTHER DAY.

20
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,029
>> OH.

21
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,114
>> I'M SO SORRY.

22
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,449
I'M SO SORRY.

23
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,493
A RAT JUST JUMPED ON MY FACE.

24
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,327
I'M SO SORRY.

25
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,828
IT JUST JUMPED ON MY FACE.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,412
I'M SO SORRY.

27
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,998
>> WELL, HE'S GONE NOW.

28
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,666
>> IT WAS LIKE IN MY MOUTH.

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,294
>> I'M SORRY, KARISHMA.

30
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,379
KARISHMA, IT'S OKAY.

31
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:08,044
>> THAT'S IT.

32
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:14,717
>> THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST
RAINS WE'VE HAD.

33
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:19,055
I HAVE DRY SOCKS YOU CAN PUT ON
YOUR FEET OR SOMETHING.

34
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,015
>> JUST HOLD MY HANDS.

35
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,058
YOU'RE FREEZING.

36
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,686
LAST NIGHT WAS PROBABLY THE
WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

37
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,273
I WAS POURED ON, FREEZING, WITH
NO ONE TO KEEP ME WARM EXCEPT

38
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,776
FOR MISSY, AND I'M LIKE, I'M
OVER THIS, THIS SUCKS.

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,111
BUT THAT'S THE GAME.

40
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,280
THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT I SIGNED
UP FOR.

41
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,783
I HAVEN'T COME THIS FAR TO ONLY
COME THIS FAR.

42
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:45,707
AND LET A RAINY NIGHT COMPLETELY
BREAK ME.

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,961
>> KARISHMA WAS NOT THE MOST...

44
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,421
>> WHAT DID SHE SAY?

45
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,840
>> SHE'S LIKE, UH...

46
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,757
>> HOLD MY HAND.

47
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,637
>> SHE GETS MAD BECAUSE I ASK
FOR A BLANKET?

48
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,805
KARISHMA IS LUCKY TO BE HERE.

49
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,307
SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AROUND
CAMP.

50
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,558
SHE LAYS IN THE BLANKET.

51
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,644
SHE'S ALWAYS THE FIRST TO GO TO
BED AND THE LAST THE WAKE UP.

52
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,607
>> DOES EVERYONE AGREE WITH ME?

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,275
SHE DOES NOT OPEN A COCONUT.

54
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,943
SHE DOES NOT GO GET WATER.

55
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:18,114
YOU THINK SHE'S AN 85-YEAR-OLD
WOMAN THAT HAS A SENSE OF

56
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:18,781
ENTITLEMENT.

57
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,783
I DON'T NEED TO KILL MYSELF.

58
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,912
I'M PART OF THE ELDERLY GROUP,
LUKE YOU GUYS CAN JUST TAKE CARE

59
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:24,954
OF ME.

60
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:25,455
SHE'S CRAZY.

61
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,789
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

62
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,624
WE'RE STILL HERE.

63
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,626
DO YOU WANT TO BE HERE?

64
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,543
SHOW US.

65
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,295
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD LIKE
HELP OUT.

66
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,341
>> KARISHMA, WOULD YOU OPEN A
COCONUT?

67
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,759
WOULD YOU MIND?

68
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,637
THERE'S A BUNCH ON THE TRAIL.

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,181
KARISHMA OBVIOUSLY HAS MORE
RESILIENCE THAN WE THINK BECAUSE

70
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,309
SHE'S STILL HERE, BUT SHE'S
SHOWN ME THAT SHE'S

71
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,146
INCONSISTENT, UNWORKABLE,
UNGRATEFUL, AND I HAVE NO

72
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,481
INTEREST IN WORKING WITH SOMEONE
LIKE THAT.

73
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:59,322
>> THANK YOU.

74
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,326
>> I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY
OBVIOUS THAT I'M IN TROUBLE.

75
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,036
AND I CAN ONLY BLAME MYSELF.

76
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:09,165
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST GOT OUT
HERE, WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE, I

77
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:13,002
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE LIKE
JUNGLE QUEEN.

78
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,839
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE FRIENDS SO EASILY, GET

79
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:22,512
ALONG WITH EVERYBODY, BUT WHEN
I'M STRUGGLING, LIKE I AM RIGHT

80
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:28,559
NOW, I THINK OF MY FAMILY, AND
SO SOMEONE LIKE MY HUSBAND, WHO

81
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,814
CHOOSES TO BE WITH ME AND LOVE
ME AND ME ONLY FOR THE REST OF

82
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:38,319
HIS LIFE, I MEAN, HOW COULD I
NOT SEE CLEARER THAN EVER HOW

83
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:43,157
WONDERFUL THAT KIND OF A
RELATIONSHIP IS WHEN I CAN'T

84
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,662
EVEN GET SOMEBODY TO TRUST ME
AND CARE FOR ME FOR EVEN ONE

85
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,331
VOLT OUT HERE.

86
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,875
I'M BEING VIEWED AS A GOAT.

87
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,046
ONE OF THE QUALITIES OF A GOAT
IS PREDICTABILITY.

88
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,842
BUT I'M IN THE A VERY GOOD ONE,
BECAUSE I E-MAIL NOT VERY

89
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,885
PREDICTABLE.

90
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,220
>> OH, MY GOD.

91
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,179
OH, MY GOD.

92
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,055
OH, MY GOD.

93
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,893
OH, MY GOD.

94
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:17,650
OH, MY GOD.

95
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,735
LOOK WHAT I DID?

96
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,986
I FOUND AN IDOL.

97
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,821
I FOUND MY LIFELINE IN THIS
GAME.

98
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,741
I WAS BARELY HANGING ON BY A
THAT RED.

99
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,953
AND THEN TO FIND THIS, IT GIVES
ME SOMETHING TO LEAN ON TO

100
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,123
FINALLY GET UP OFF THE GROUND
WHERE I'VE BEEN LAYING THIS

101
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,876
WHOLE TIME AND FINALLY DO
SOMETHING WITH IT.

102
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,297
THIS GIVES MAE CHANCE TO MAKE A
NAME FOR MYSELF IN THIS GAME.

103
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,466
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME.

104
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,092
>> SO WE GET OUT KARISHMA.

105
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:43,718
>> GOOD.

106
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,469
ALL RIGHT.

107
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,803
>> AFTER KARISHMA YOU THINK
JANET?

108
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,971
>> THAT'S FINE.

109
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,433
>> MY PUSH IS JANET IS HARD
WORKER AND IF YOU DID WANT THE

110
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:55,396
KEEP HER, THAT WOULD BE GOOD,
BUT IF NOT, I WOULD UNDERSTAND.

111
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,439
KARISHMA, ARE YOU OKAY?

112
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,610
YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOREVER, AND
YOU GOT TWO COCONUTS.

113
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:05,948
YOU WERE KWON FOR AN -- YOU WERE
GONE FOR AN HOUR.

114
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:11,954
>> I WENT AROUND IN CIRCLES.

115
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,416
I REALIZE, I'VE BEEN GONE FOR A
REALLY LONG TIME.

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,210
CAN I DRINK SOMEONE'S WATER?

117
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,461
>> YEAH.

118
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,005
>> SO I PLAY UP THE FEELING SICK
THING, BECAUSE THAT'S MY FIRST

119
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:21,672
INSTINCT.

120
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,132
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

121
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,301
>> I NEED TO CALL THE DOCTOR.

122
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,761
I'M SERIOUS.

123
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,804
CAN I HAVE AN HOUR?

124
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,679
>> NO.

125
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,931
YOU'RE GETTING WORSE.

126
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,808
>> THIS IS NOT YOUR DECISION
ANYMORE.

127
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,812
>> GUY, IT'S MY BODY, IT IS MY
DECISION.

128
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:40,817
>> IF YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO GET
ME LIKE THROWN OUT OF THE GAME

129
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,985
OR SOMETHING --
>> NOBODY WANTS YOU TO GET

130
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,487
MEDIVACKED OUT OF THE GAME.

131
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,782
>> I FEEL BETTER AFTER DRINKING
SOME WATER.

132
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,951
>> JUST NOW, JUST LIKE THAT?

133
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,287
>> I DON'T NEED THIS WHOLE
DETOUR OF THE DOCTOR BEING

134
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,497
CALLED ON ME.

135
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,792
I'M THINKING, OH, MY GOD, I
DON'T NEED THIS DRAMA, I NEED TO

136
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,796
GET BACK, SIT DOWN, AND THINK
ABOUT HOW I'M GOING THE PLAY MY

137
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,881
IDOL.

138
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,145
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

139
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,070
ALL RIGHT.

140
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,656
FIRST THINGS FIRST, GOT THE TAKE
BACK THE NECKLACES.

141
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,825
AARON AND MISSY.

142
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,993
THANK YOU.

143
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:37,331
THANK YOU.

144
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,834
ONE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

145
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,004
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO STAND ON A NARROW BEAM

146
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:47,175
WHILE SPINNING A BALL INSIDE A
CIRCULAR WOODEN TRACK.

147
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,511
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU'LL MOVE
FURTHER DOWN THE BEAM, MAKING IT

148
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,679
MORE DIFFICULT.

149
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,682
IF AIN THE POINT YOU FALL OFF
THE BEAM OR YOUR BALL DROPS,

150
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,392
YOU'RE OUT.

151
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,895
TO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE
INTERESTING.

152
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,062
>> UH-OH.

153
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,023
>> Jeff: TODAY WE'RE GOING TO
DIVIDE YOU INTO TWO GROUPS.

154
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,734
ONE PERSON FROM EACH GROUP WILL
WIN IMMUNITY.

155
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,486
BOTH GRIEWBS WILL GO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL SEPARATELY.

156
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,032
BOTH GROUPS WILL VOTE SOMEBODY
OUT.

157
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,410
SO TWO WINNERS, TWO PEOPLE GOING
HOME.

158
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:18,039
WE'LL DRAW TO SEE WHICH GROUP
YOU'RE ON AND WE'LL GET STARTED.

159
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,290
>> HERE WE GO.

160
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,417
>> OKAY, JEFF.

161
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,256
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

162
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,051
WE HAVE OUR TWO GROUPS COMPETING
AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ORANGE,

163
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:34,889
IT'S MISSY, TOMMY, ELAINE,
ELIZABETH, AND KARISHMA.

164
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:40,019
AND IN PURPLE IT'S DEAN, DAN,
LAURAN, AARON, NOURA, AND

165
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,021
JANICE.

166
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:42,396
ALL RIGHT.

167
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,147
HERE WE GO.

168
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,524
TWO PEOPLE GOING TO WIN
IMMUNITY.

169
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,900
TWO PEOPLE GOING HOME.

EVERYBODY START SPINNING.

171
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,989
I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO GET
STARTED.

172
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,533
THEN I'LL CALL THIS CHALLENGE TO
BEGIN.

173
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,828
GIVE EVERYBODY A SHOT TO GET
THEIR MOMENTUM AND GET THAT BALL

174
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,331
SPINNING, AND THEN THE CHALLENGE
WILL BE ALIVE FROM THAT POINT

175
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,833
FORWARD.

176
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,459
EVERYBODY'S GOOD.

177
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,503
WE'RE JUST WAITING ON DAN.

178
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:11,968
YOU HAVE 15 SECOND, DAN TO, GET
IT GOING.

179
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,885
DAN'S GOOD.

180
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:19,517
EVERYBODY IS GOOD, AND THIS
CHALLENGE IS ON.

181
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,143
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL THE
PRESSURE.

182
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,311
HOW LONG CAN YOU GO?

183
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,106
THIS IS A WEIRD CHALLENGE TO DO.

184
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,483
SOME PEOPLE JUST NATURALLY GET
IT.

185
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,612
OTHERS WILL ALWAYS STRUGGLE.

186
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,655
KARISHMA FIRST TO DROP.

187
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,155
SHE'S OUT.

188
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,701
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

189
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,661
MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE
INTERESTING.

190
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:45,418
THE LAST PERSON STANDING NOT
ONLY WINS IMMUNITY BUT WINS FOR

191
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,462
THEIR GROUP PB&J WAITING FOR YOU
BACK AT CAMP.

192
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,008
AN YOU WILL GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
LAST, SO YOU WILL HAVE THE

193
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,511
KNOWLEDGE OF THE INFORMATION OF
THE FIRST VOTE.

194
00:09:55,594 --> 00:10:02,101
YOU ARE PLAYING FOR A LOT RIGHT
NOW ON DAY 27 IN "SURVIVOR."

195
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,269
ALL RIGHT.

196
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,856
WE'RE NOW GOING TO PUT THE FIRST
FOOT ON THE BALANCE BEAM.

197
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,523
START MOVING IT IN.

198
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,860
YOU HAVE THE CLEAR THE PAINT.

199
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,403
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
GOOD.

200
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:18,534
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT THE LOOK
DOWN.

201
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:19,035
ELIZABETH DROPS.

202
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,369
SHE'S OUT.

203
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,538
YOU'RE GOOD, ELAINE.

204
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,039
DEAN'S GOOD.

205
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,540
DAN IS GOOD.

206
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:29,962
EVERYBODY IS GOOD.

207
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:30,713
TOMMY DROPS.

208
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,051
WE'RE DOWN TO TWO LEFT IN
ORANGE.

209
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:35,718
AARON DROPS.

210
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,553
HE'S OUT.

211
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:42,892
ORANGE IS NOW DOWN TO MISSY AND
ELAINE.

212
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,517
DAN DROPS.

213
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,394
HE'S OUT.

214
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,564
CAN'T PEEVE IT.

215
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,231
LAURAN DROPS.

216
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,733
WE'RE DOWN THE THREE ON PURPLE.

217
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,401
SHE'S NOT HAPPY.

218
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:57,406
IT IS DEAN, NOURA AND JANET
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY.

219
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,744
MISSY AND ELAINE FIGHTING FOR
IMMUNITY.

220
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,704
LOTS OF DIFFERENT SPEEDS AND
ROTATION.

221
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,039
SOME PEOPLE WHIPPING IT.

222
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,749
OTHERS GOING VERY SLOW.

223
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,045
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER, AS
LONG AS THAT BALL JUST KEEPS

224
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:18,469
MOVING INSIDE THAT TRACK.

225
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,187
ALL RIGHT.

226
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,650
I WANT EVERYBODY TO GET READY TO
MOVE TO THAT NEXT SECTION.

227
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,859
JANET DROPS.

228
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,780
SHE'S OUT AND WE'RE DOWN TO
SHOWDOWN ON BOTH COLORS BETWEEN

229
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,575
MISSY AND ELAINE AND DEAN AND
NOURA.

230
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:46,414
EVERYBODY START TO MAKE YOU MOVE
INTO THAT SECOND SECTION OF THE

231
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:54,213
BEAM.

232
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:54,755
DEAN DROPS.

233
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,673
HE'S OUT.

234
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,926
NOURA WINS IMMUNITY FOR PURPLE.

235
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,011
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.

236
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,348
>> Jeff: AND NOURA DROPS
BEFORE GIVING UP HER SHOT AT

237
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,182
WINNING ANYTHING FOR PURPLE.

238
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,308
>> STUPID.

239
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,145
>> Jeff: NOURA JUST BLEW A
GIANT OPPORTUNITY, WHICH MEANS

240
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,813
PBSO AND J IS GOING TO ORANGE.

241
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,984
>> WE COULD HAVE WON PB&J.

242
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,277
NOURA MIGHT HAVE LASTED LONGER.

243
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,991
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED,
NOURA.

244
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,994
>> Jeff: IT IS NOW A SHOWDOWN.

245
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,787
MISSY, NICE SAVE.

246
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,331
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO DO WITH
ANOTHER NICE SAVE.

247
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,833
STAY IN IT.

248
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,627
IT IS MISSY AND ELAINE.

249
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:42,386
LAST ONE STANDING WINS IMMUNITY.

250
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,684
MISSY DROPS.

251
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,854
ELAINE WYNNS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
FOR ORANGE.

252
00:12:51,937 --> 00:13:01,864
NOURA WINS FOR PURPLE.

253
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,365
>> I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

254
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,704
>> Jeff: NOURA, COME ON OVER.

255
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,121
CONGRATULATIONS.

256
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,707
>> THANK YOU.

257
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,375
>> Jeff: IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

258
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,544
YOU CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THE
GAME TONIGHT.

259
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,712
>> CAN I HUG YOU?

260
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,713
>> Jeff: OF COURSE.

261
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,549
CONGRATS.

262
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,592
ELAINE, ARE YOU IN SHOCK?

263
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,385
>> A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.

264
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,430
>> Jeff: COME ON OVER, ELAINE.

265
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,350
>> ALL RIGHT, ELAINE!

266
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,018
>> Jeff: COME ON, I LOVE THE
LOVE.

267
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,228
>> IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

268
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,187
>>.

269
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,689
>> Jeff: CONGRATS.

270
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,066
>> I'M SO PSYCHED.

271
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,693
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST
MOMENTS OF MY LIFE.

272
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,569
>> Jeff: REALLY?

273
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,570
>> YES.

274
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,364
>> Jeff: WHAT IS IT ABOUT A
MOMENT LIKE THIS?

275
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,366
BECAUSE THIS PROVES SOMETHING TO
YOU?

276
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,575
WHAT IS IT?

277
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,037
>> WELL, I'M WITH A BUNCH OF
ATHLETES WHO BEAST MODE THROUGH

278
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,207
EVERYTHING, AND YOU HELP TO GET
LITTLE REDNECK GAME OVER HERE,

279
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,752
AND I'M GOOD AT REDNECK THINGS,
SO I ROCKED IT.

280
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,045
>> Jeff: WORKED OUT.

281
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,880
YOU'RE SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

282
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,590
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.

283
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,883
>> GOOD JOB, ELAINE.

284
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,093
>> YEAH, GIRL.

285
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:08,222
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, ELIZABETH,
TOMMY, ELAINE, MISSY, KARISHMA,

286
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,725
BACK AT CAMP, PB&J WAIT, AND
MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU WILL

287
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,812
GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL SECOND, SO
YOU WILL KNOW THE RESULTS OF

288
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,563
FIRST TRIBAL.

289
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,313
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

290
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:16,939
HEAD BACK.

291
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,815
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

292
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,899
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

293
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,151
>> GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.

294
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:21,652
ENJOY.

295
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,154
>> GOOD JOB, NOURA.

296
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:31,412
>> Jeff: NOURA, DAN, JANET,
DEAN, YOU WILL BE GOING TO THE

297
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,748
OLD LAIRO CAMP WHERE YOU WILL
HAVE BASIC SUPPLIES AUBRY YOU

298
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,334
WILL BE GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
FIRST.

299
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,085
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

300
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:38,669
HEAD OUT.

301
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,587
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

302
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,671
>> HOME SWEET HOME.

303
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,964
>> THANKS, JEFF.

304
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,009
WHEN I HEARD THERE WOULD BE TWO
GROUPS GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,

305
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,846
I GOT A LITTLE SCARED, BECAUSE
BEFORE THIS SPLIT, KARISHMA WAS

306
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,808
PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE VOTE
TONIGHT, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I

307
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,977
ABSOLUTELY COULD BE GOING HOME.

308
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,103
IT'S NERVE-RACKING.

309
00:14:56,186 --> 00:15:00,024
BUT I WILL KEEP FIGHTING.

310
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,414
>> WOW.

311
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:15,956
>> HOLY MOLEY.

312
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,457
THIS IS SO DIFFERENT.

313
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:16,832
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

314
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:17,458
>> YEAH, YEAH.

315
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,335
>> THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

316
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,461
THANK YOU.

317
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,838
>> NOURA, GOOD WORK.

318
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,799
>> SO WE COME BACK TO OUR OLD
LAIRO CAMP.

319
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,760
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

320
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,637
IT BRINGS BACK BAD MEMORIES.

321
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,846
THIS IS THE LOWEST OF THE LOW.

322
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:35,017
I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE, GO TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND GET BACK TO

323
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,559
VOKAI BEACH.

324
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,186
>> LET'S SEE THIS CAMP.

325
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:44,026
>> THE LAST TWO TRIBAL COUNCILS
I'VE HAD THE NECKLACE.

326
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,028
THIS TRIBE SWITCH FOR ME IS
UNSETTLING, BUT THE FACT THAT

327
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,031
KARISHMA IS ON ONE TRIBE AND
JANET ON THIS TRIBE, THIS COULD

328
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,034
BE A PERFECT STORM HAPPENING,
AND GUESS WHAT?

329
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:56,205
WE GET TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.

330
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,209
>>
>> I'M GUESSING HOW DO YOU FEEL?

331
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,377
>> JANET, RIGHT?

332
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,544
>> YEAH.

333
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,046
JANET FOUND AN IDOL.

334
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,172
SHE'S DANGEROUS.

335
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,050
>> JANET HAS BEEN ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK FOR A WHILE, BUT

336
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,886
AARON IS SUCH A PHYSICAL AND
SOCIAL THREAT, AND HE DIDN'T WIN

337
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:15,057
THE NECKLACE TODAY, SO HE'S LIKE
A DEER IN THE WOODS THAT'S JUST

338
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,394
UNATTENDED, ALONE, NO PEOPLE BY
HIS SIDE, WE HAVE A CLEAR SHOT.

339
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,230
LIKE WHY WOULD WE NOT TAKE IT?

340
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,691
>> I GO, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

341
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,192
AND HE GOES, JANET, RIGHT?

342
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:25,901
>> RIGHT.

343
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,403
>> THE BIGGEST THREAT IS AARON.

344
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:27,820
>> YES.

345
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,029
>> OBVIOUSLY.

346
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,031
>> YES.

347
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,201
YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO
BE --

348
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,537
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYBODY
WANTS TO GET RID OF AARON.

349
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,541
I WAS LIKE, W OO O HOO.

350
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,792
>> I BELIEVE YOU.

351
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:47,715
>> IT WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLE THAT
I COULD STILL BE HERE AFTER WHAT

352
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,759
I'VE GONE THROUGH.

353
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,053
THIS COULD BE UNFREAKIN'
BELIEVABLE.

354
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,263
>> WE'RE BACK THE PLAYING THE
GAME.

355
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,559
>> AND IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF
YOU AND I COULD PUT SOME CLOSURE

356
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,184
TO THE WORLD.

357
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,436
>> I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE.

358
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,939
NOW LET'S PLAY THE GAME, BECAUSE
RIGHT NOW I WOULD SAY IT'S 90%,

359
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:07,526
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SOMEONE I
WANT TO VOTE WITH AND TRUST

360
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,652
WITH.

361
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,822
I HOPE IF ANYONE BRINGS MY NAME
TO YOU, YOU'LL TELL ME.

362
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,490
>> DEAL.

363
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,199
>> OKAY.

364
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,785
>> I SWEAR TO YOU ON MY FAMILY.

365
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,330
>> TWO DAYS AGO EVERYONE ACROSS
THE BOARD WANTED JANET GONE.

366
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,750
NOW WE COME HERE, JANET'S SAFE.

367
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:27,296
BUT IF AARON HEADS HOME, THEN
WHO ELSE DO PEOPLE SEE AS A

368
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,172
PHYSICAL THREAT?

369
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,465
ME.

370
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:33,343
SO AT LEAST FOR ME IN THE SHORT
TERM, AARON IS WAY BETTER FOR ME

371
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,928
IN THIS GAME THAN JANET.

372
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,182
>> I WANT TO RUN THROUGH SOME
THOUGHTS.

373
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:43,562
AARON, KARISHMA, LAURAN, JANET,
AND NOURA START THE TAKE OVER,

374
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,606
AND THEY'RE GOING TO COME FOR
THE PHYSICAL THREATS.

375
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,817
I THINK PEOPLE ON THE JURY WOULD
RESPECT JANET'S POSITION.

376
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,319
>> JANET WILL WIN THIS GAME.

377
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,987
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

378
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,863
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

379
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,072
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

380
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,326
>> DEAN FEELS THAT WE SHOULD
VOTE OUT JANET, BECAUSE JANET IS

381
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,411
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS IN
THIS GAME.

382
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,788
SHE MADE FIRE.

383
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,831
SHE IS EVERYONE'S MAMA.

384
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:07,836
SHE HAS A GREAT STORY, BUT JANET
HAS COME BACK TO ME, AN WE CAN

385
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,296
LEGITIMATELY WORK TOGETHER IN
THE FUTURE AND BE FRIENDS.

386
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,006
>> WE HAD UNANIMOUS JANET.

387
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,050
AND NOW SHE'S WORKING HER WAY
BACK IN.

388
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,301
>> RIGHT.

389
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:18,180
WE COULD EASILY FLIP THE VOTE
BACK THE JANET, BUT FOR MY GAME

390
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,559
I'M 50/50 ON WHETHER AARON OR
JANET IS BETTER.

391
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,687
IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE BEFORE
THESE TWO TRIBES HAVE SPLIT UP,

392
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,857
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE KARISHMA
OR JANET, BUT NOW WHO KNOWS,

393
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,983
RIGHT?

394
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,735
I WISH I COULD SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING ON THE OTHER SIDE.

395
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,531
>> I'M ASSUMING KARISHMA
CONTINUES TO REMAIN THE EASY

396
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,368
VOTE WHEN THEY GO TO THEIR
TRIBAL.

397
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,036
BUT LIKE CAN IT BE THIS EASY?

398
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,375
>> GUYS, WELL DONE.

399
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,545
>> ELAINE, YOU GOT THE KISS JEFF
TODAY.

400
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,921
>> ELOVED IT.

401
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,715
>> KISS ON THE CHEEK.

402
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,716
KISS ON THE DIMPLE.

403
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,386
>> OUR TRIBAL TONIGHT IS GOING
TO BE SUPER SIMPLE.

404
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,262
KARISHMA GOES.

405
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,348
THAT WAS THE OVERALL PLAN
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

406
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,224
WRONG.

407
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,517
COMPLETELY WRONG.

408
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,521
I WAS SUPER HAPPY THAT THE OTHER
GROUP WAS NOT BACK IN TRIBE WITH

409
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,564
US.

410
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,232
I NEED FREEDOM OF THE CAMP.

411
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,527
I NEED MY TIME WITH MY GIRLS SO
I CAN DICTATE THE VOTE.

412
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,738
WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR GAME IS
MISSY'S GAME AND MISSY WANTS TO

413
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,239
WIN THE GAME.

414
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,533
>> HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

415
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:29,543
WE NEED TO SEPARATE TOMMY FROM
LAUREN.

416
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,752
IF HE GOES HOME.

417
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:38,051
SHE'S DEPENDENT ON US.

418
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,430
I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO
USE KARISHMA IN A WAY TO ELEVATE

419
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,222
MY GAME.

420
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,600
HAVING TOMMY GONE OPENS UP
LAUREN.

421
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,436
THAT MEANS WE HAVE A GUY THAT
CAN OPEN UP THE GAME.

422
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,980
HE'S PERSONABLE.

423
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:50,939
EVERYBODY LOVES TOMY.

424
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:56,987
NO ONE IS GOING TO AWARD
KARISHMA $1 MILLION.

425
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,155
>> HERE'S THE PLAN.

426
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,032
WE SEND TOMMY HOME.

427
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,033
KEEP THE GIRLS STRONG.

428
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,535
HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION
WITH EVERY PERSON.

429
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,745
>> GOT IT.

430
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,122
>> NO, DON'T GIVE ANYBODY NAME,
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HERE, YOU

431
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,249
ALREADY KNOW, WANTS TO PUT THEIR
VOTES ON YOU.

432
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,500
THAT'S THE GAME PLAN.

433
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,084
BUT LISTEN.

434
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,586
LISTEN.

435
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,672
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO PUT THEIR
VOTES ON YOU.

436
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,675
LISTEN, WHEN WE GET THE
TRIBAL --

437
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,510
>> I KNOW, BUT I WANT TO TALK TO
EVERYBODY.

438
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:25,349
>> LOOK, I'M ON AT THE BOTTOM.

439
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:29,645
MISSY, I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
BUT I NEED TO TALK TO EVERYBODY.

440
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,479
>> COME HERE.

441
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:35,651
GIVE ME TWO MINUTES.

442
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,656
>> MISSY WAS TALKING AT ME, NOT
TALKING WITH ME.

443
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,865
SHE'S A BULLY TO ME.

444
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,827
I'M NOT TAKING THAT ANYMORE, NOT
FROM A 24-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO

445
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,329
THINKS SHE'S ON TOP OF THE
WORLD.

446
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,164
>> KARISHMA, YOU WANT TO TALK?

447
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,874
THE ANSWER IS NO.

448
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,917
I WANT TO TALK.

449
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,628
>> I'D RATHER WAIT UNTIL YOUR
EMOTIONS ARE CALMER.

450
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,005
>> I'M SUPER CALM, KARISHMA.

451
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:57,839
>> JUST WAIT.

452
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,508
>> HOW LONG WOULD YOU LIKE THE
WAIT?

453
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,176
>> I DON'T HAVE A WATCH.

454
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,011
I'LL WAIT UNTIL I FEEL MORE
COMFORTABLE.

455
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,887
>> OKAY.

456
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,888
OKAY.

457
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,348
I'M SORRY, LITTLE GIRL.

458
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,183
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO CALM
DOWN.

459
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,184
I'M TOO OLD FOR THAT.

460
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,394
YOU KNOW WHAT?

461
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,438
I'M GLAD THE HEAR THAT TOMMY'S
NAME IS COMING UP AND NOT MINE,

462
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:17,109
OF COURSE, BUT I'LL TALK TO YOU
WHEN I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

463
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,695
I HAVE 13 YEARS ON YOU, MISSY.

464
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,864
I AM NOT YOUR PUPPY THAT YOU CAN
GO THROW A BONE AND HAVE ME

465
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,448
FETCH IT FOR YOU.

466
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,867
>> YOU KNOW HOW MISSY IS.

467
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,037
SHE'S VERY OVERBEARING.

468
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,539
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT.

469
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,708
>> SHE WAS GOING A MILE A MINUTE
AT ME.

470
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,710
SHE TRIED TO TELL ME HOW TO GET
TOMMY OUT.

471
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,752
>> REALLY?

472
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,713
HOLY COW, MISSY WANTS TOMMY OUT.

473
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,214
THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

474
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,591
AND AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T
LIKE HOW PEOPLE TALK TO

475
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,384
KARISHMA.

476
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,886
SHE JUST NEEDS WORDS OF
ENCOURAGE.

477
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,054
AND POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT.

478
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,724
KARISHMA HAS POWER TONIGHT, MORE
POWER THAN SHE MAY REALIZE.

479
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:54,229
>> OKAY, SO BASICALLY I SEE
MISSY, ELIZABETH, ME, I'M ON THE

480
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,023
BOTTOM OF THAT ALLIANCE.

481
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,359
WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS THAT I'M
VOTING FOR MISSY TONIGHT.

482
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,904
>> IF I'M GOING OUT TONIGHT, I'M
GOING OUT SWINGING AT MY BULLY.

483
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,032
>> MISSY IS GOING WAY TOO HARD.

484
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,867
THEY CAME AT KARISHMA HOT.

485
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,869
I'M COMING WITH COMPASSION AND
UNDERSTANDING.

486
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,704
SO I NEED TO STRIKE WHILE THE
IRON IS HOT.

487
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,205
YOU CAN'T HESITATE IN THIS GAME.

488
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,707
YOU HAVE TO SEIZE EVERY MOMENT.

489
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,042
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

490
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,877
WITH THIS BABY AROUND MY NECK.

491
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,253
THIS HELPS A LITTLE BIT MORE.

492
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,547
>> YOU CAN TRUST ME.

493
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,259
SHE SAID MISSY HAD THIS WHOLE
PLAN ABOUT HOW TO GET YOU OUT.

494
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:24,968
>> TONIGHT?

495
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,512
>> LISTEN, I AM NOT VOTING YOU.

496
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,305
>> PROMISE?

497
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,264
>> I SWEAR.

498
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:33,101
I AM VOTING FOR MISSY AND CAR IS
VOTING MISSY.

499
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,269
ELIZABETH ISN'T, THOUGH.

500
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,314
SO THE PROBLEM IS, WE'RE HINGING
ALL OF THIS ON KARISHMA, AND

501
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,565
SHE'S BEEN SO WISHY WASHI.

502
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,985
>> MISSY HAS BROUGHT UP MY NAME
TO KNOCK ME OUT, SO OF COURSE

503
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,696
WHEN YOU BRING UP MY NAME, I'M
COMING AFTER YOU.

504
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,657
SO KARISHMA WENT FROM THE MOST
UNPOPULAR KID IN CLASS TO NOW

505
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:52,662
THE MOST POPULAR KID IN CLASS
WHERE EVERYONE WANTS HER VOTE.

506
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:57,584
>> IS IT OKAY IF YOU TALK TO ME?

507
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,295
MISSY HASN'T BEEN NICE TO
KARISHMA.

508
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,881
I VIEW HER AS A PERSON AND NOT
AS A GOAT.

509
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,967
I DIDN'T HAVE THE EASIEST
CHILDHOOD BEING BULLIED, SO

510
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,470
KARISHMA, I HOPE SHE REALIZES
THAT I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT HER

511
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,138
AND WANT TO WORK WITH HER.

512
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,100
BESIDES, MISSY NEVER WANTED TO
MY WITH YOU BEFORE THIS VOTE.

513
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:17,312
>> I REALIZE HOW I COME OFF A
LOT, AND I'M SO SORRY.

514
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,480
I'M SORRY.

515
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,815
I MESSED UP.

516
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,816
I'M SORRY.

517
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,651
>> I DIDN'T MEAN TO LIKE WALK
AWAY LIKE I DID.

518
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,696
>> I GOT SUPER EXCITED, BECAUSE
I SAW THE PLAN AND I SAW THE WAY

519
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,033
WHERE YOU STAY SOMEHOW AND TOMMY
NOW LEAVES.

520
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,161
>> KARISHMA, LISTEN, I AM SO
SORRY.

521
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:38,333
LY HUG YOU, LET'S CRY TOGETHER,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

522
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,002
WE NEED HIM THE LEAVE.

523
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,797
IF WE CAN GET HIM OUT TONIGHT,
THE GIRLS HAVE THE MAJORITY.

524
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,299
>> OH, MY GOSH.

525
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:46,800
WE HAVE A HUGE MAJORITY.

526
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,677
>> EXACTLY.

527
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,013
BUT WE GET TO TRIBAL, WE'RE
GOING TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO.

528
00:23:52,097 --> 00:24:00,856
THIS IS WHY, KARISHMA, HAS TO GO
HOME.

529
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,191
THESE ARE THE THINGS.

530
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,360
I DON'T LIKE HER, I DON'T KNOW
HER.

531
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,028
>> WHO ARE WE TRYING TO
CONVINCE?

532
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,280
>> WE'RE JUST TALKING.

533
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:12,868
>> I WENT FROM BEING DOWN IN THE
DUMPS TO NOW I'M THE ONE WHO IS

534
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,537
GOING TO BE MAKING THE DECISION
TONIGHT WHO GOES HOME.

535
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,874
MISSY WAS AT THE TOP OF MY KILL
LIST BECAUSE WE'RE CONSTANTLY

536
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:23,044
FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER, BUT
TONIGHT'S DECISION HAS TO BE

537
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:23,879
ENTIRELY LOGICAL.

538
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,547
IT CANNOT BE EMOTIONAL.

539
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,260
AS A TRIAL LAWYER, YOU HAVE TO
BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR EMOTIONS,

540
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,428
AND WEIGH THE RISKINGS.

541
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,015
SOILY WORK WITH MISSY IF IT'S
THE BEST THING FOR MY GAME.

542
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,517
>> EVERYONE WANTS HIM GONE.

543
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,353
WE HAVE A CHANCE.

544
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,563
>> I HEAR YOU.

545
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:46,526
FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE A SHOT
AT TOMMY BECAUSE HIS CLOSEST

546
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,361
ALLIES ARE OVER AT THE OTHER
TRIBE.

547
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,071
HE'S A SITTING DUCK.

548
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,239
IT'S PERFECT.

549
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,367
BUT WITH MISSY, IT SOUNDS A
LITTLE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

550
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,747
FOR ALL I KNOW, SHE'S PLAYING
ME.

551
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,956
IT'S A LITTLE FISHY.

552
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,710
IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD, THERE'S
STILL A CHANCE IT COULD BE ME.

553
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:09,382
THANKFULLY, I HAVE AN IMMUNITY
IDOL IN MY TRUSTY BRA OVER HERE.

554
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,884
MY GUT SAYS TO PLAY IT.

555
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,678
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE I'M HERE
TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY.

556
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,222
>> WHERE'S THE OTHER TRIBE?

557
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,974
>> MAYBE THEY WENT TO LAIRO.

558
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,059
WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING?

559
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,187
>> I THINK JANET.

560
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,315
>> I FEEL VERY BLESSED TO HAVE
BEEN PART OF ALL OF THIS,

561
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,399
ESPECIALLY AT MY AGE.

562
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,693
>> JANET IS GOING HOME.

563
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,488
AND I'M ALL BUT CERTAIN THAT
JANET KNOWS THAT HER TIME IN

564
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,739
THIS GAME IS UP.

565
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,991
I DON'T HAVE AN IMMUNITY
NECKLACE ON TODAY.

566
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,203
THIS IS MY VERY FIRST TIME THAT
I'M TRULY GOING TO FIND OUT THAT

567
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,788
THE ALLIANCE IS WORKING WITH ME.

568
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,500
>> SO HOPEFULLY IT'S KARISHMA
AND JANET.

569
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,753
>> SHE DUG HER OWN GRAVE
EARLIER.

570
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,130
>> A "SURVIVOR" GOD GIFT.

571
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:49,714
EASY.

572
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,340
SHE'S GOT TO GO.

573
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,007
>> I AGREE.

574
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,968
>> JANET IS A BOSS.

575
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,971
JANET IS A VERY STRONG WOMAN,
AND SHE IS A BIG THREAT, BUT A

576
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,932
LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THREATENED BY
AARON.

577
00:25:59,015 --> 00:25:59,683
HE'S A BEAST.

578
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,143
I CANNOT BEAT AARON IN
CHALLENGES.

579
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,646
SO TONIGHT'S GOING TO BE A
REALLY TOUGH VOTE.

580
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,647
>> I WAS IN TROUBLE.

581
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,985
I WAS ON THIN ICE, BUT IT IS NOT
ROCKET SCIENCE.

582
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,988
THIS GROUP IS DONE WITH AARON.

583
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,197
>> WE'RE GOOD.

584
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:20,996
>> RIGHT NOW I'M FEELING SAFE,
WHICH IS A SCARY PLACE TO BE,

585
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:27,002
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MANY
PLIED -- BLINDSIDE AT TRIBAL.

586
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,211
>> WE SHOULD ALL GET AN OSCAR.

587
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,130
>> I JUST HOPING I'M NOT FOOLING
MYSELF THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

588
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,118
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

589
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,377
>> LOOK AT HIM, ROLLING UP HIS
SHIRT, SHOWING HIS MUSCLES

590
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:18,178
AGAIN.

591
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,389
DAN, WHAT'S THE BIGGEST IMPACT
OF THIS TWIST THAT DIVIDED YOU

592
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,640
INTO TWO GROUPS?

593
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,185
>> INITIALLY IT WAS TERRIFYING,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN AGENDA AND

594
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,188
YOU HAVE AN ALLIANCE AND YOU'RE
MOVING FORWARD IN A PARTICULAR

595
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,566
DIRECTION, BUT THE TEAMS SEEM TO
HAVE SCRAMBLED IN A WAY THAT

596
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:35,070
SHOULD ALLOW THE PEOPLE THAT
WERE THE TARGETS TO STILL BE THE

597
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:35,820
TARGETS.

598
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,572
>> Jeff: REALLY INTERESTING,
JANET.

599
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,866
DAN JUST SPOKE FOR THE ENTIRE
GROUP, SAYING FORTUNATELY

600
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,076
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO GO AS
PLANNED.

601
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,539
>> WELL, I'M DEFINITELY LOW MAN
ON THE TOTEM POLL, AND I THINK

602
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,583
THAT'S DIRECTED AT ME.

603
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,377
>> Jeff: DEAN, HOW ABOUT FOR
YOU?

604
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,545
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST IMPACT FROM
YOUR POINT OF VIEW TO THIS

605
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,755
TWIST?

606
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,882
>> WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE CERTAIN
PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS YOU TRUST

607
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,385
THAT WERE LEFT ON THE OTHER
SIDE, IT'S VERY, VERY

608
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,427
CONCERNING.

609
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,971
THERE IS DEFINITELY
RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THIS GROUP

610
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,892
THAT ARE TIGHTER THAN
RELATIONSHIPS THAT I HAVE.

611
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,977
>> Jeff: AARON, WHAT DID YOU
FEEL AFTER THE CHALLENGE WAS

612
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:12,107
OVER IN TERMS OF ANXIETY VERSUS
COMFORT VERSUS UNCERTAINTY?

613
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,069
>> ME PERSONALLY, THIS IS MY
FIRST TIME SITTING AT A TRIBAL

614
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:20,115
COUNCIL WITHOUT A NECKLACE ON,
SO IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF

615
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,326
MY ALLIANCES AND THE
RELATIONSHIPS THAT I FORMED ARE

616
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,285
GOING TO HOLD UP.

617
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,995
>> Jeff: INTERESTING THAT YOU
SAY OPPORTUNITY.

618
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,748
A LOT OF PEOPLE HIGH SAY, JEFF,
I'M TERRIFIED.

619
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,668
THERE'S ONLY SEX PEOPLE AND I
DIDN'T WIN, BUT YOU SEEM VERY

620
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,585
CALM.

621
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,587
>> WELL, WHEN I SAY
"OPPORTUNITY," IT'S AN

622
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,298
OPPORTUNITY FOR MY NAME TO BE
WRITTEN ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER.

623
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,510
I'M NOT CALLING IT ALL, BUT WHAT
WE HAVE IS A GROUP OF

624
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,679
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WORKING
TOGETHER AND HAVE A PLAN IN

625
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,682
PLACE, AND AT THIS POINT IN
TIME, WE ALL FEEL COMFORTABLE

626
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,976
WORKING TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.

627
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,353
>> BUT YOU KNOW, STUFF ALWAYS
HAPPENS.

628
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,479
THERE'S ALWAYS SURPRISES.

629
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,692
LIKE WE LOST JACK, BOOM, BECAUSE
I UNDERESTIMATED DEAN.

630
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,653
ONE VOTE CAN BE WHAT CHANGES
EVERYTHING.

631
00:28:58,736 --> 00:28:59,487
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

632
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,823
>> I THINK IT'S JANET.

633
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,826
>> Jeff: SO JANET, WHAT DO YOU
DO IF YOU THINK IT'S YOU AND

634
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,494
THERE ARE ONLY FIVE PEOPLE TO
TALK TO?

635
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:12,959
>> WELL, I TALK TO A FEW PEOPLE,
AND MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL GO, DUH,

636
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,962
THAT MAYBE MADE SOME SENSE,
MAYBE I SHOULD MAKE A MOVE.

637
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,716
>> Jeff: NOURA, DID JANET
APPROACH YOU AND SAY, WE SHOULD

638
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,010
TALK?

639
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,720
>> I TALK TO JANET ALL THE TIME.

640
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:28,016
SHE'S MY MOMMY AND MY FRIEND,
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A BOUNDARY

641
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,018
AT SOME POINT WHERE IT'S LIKE, I
-- AM I GOING TO RISK ME BEING

642
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,022
HERE AHEAD OF YOU?

643
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,565
THERE IS A BOUNDARY THERE?

644
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,902
>> Jeff: DAN, WHAT DOES IT
MEAN FOR THE GAME TO LOSE TWO

645
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,069
PEOPLE AT ONCE?

646
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,031
>> I THINK THAT WAS THE OTHER
NERVE-RACKING FACTOR OF THIS

647
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,869
TWIST, WHICH IS THE THING THAT
WAS THREE VOTES AWAY COULD BE,

648
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,039
WELL, NOW LET'S PLAY AND WE HAVE
TO START EATING THE HEAD OF THE

649
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:51,706
SNAKE.

650
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:52,957
THE FEAR STARTS TO GET STOKED.

651
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,503
I HAVE TRIED MY HARDEST IN THIS
GAME TO HOPE THAT TRUST LEADS TO

652
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,048
LOYALTY, LOYALTY LEADS TO
ALLIANCES, AND ALLIANCES LEAD TO

653
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,384
VOTES.

654
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,177
>> Jeff: OKAY.

655
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,512
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

656
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,973
DEAN, YOU'RE UP.

657
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,131
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

658
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:01,985
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

659
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:07,782
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

660
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:08,449
ALL RIGHT.

661
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:13,288
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

662
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:18,293
FIRST VOTE, JANET.

663
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:18,960
AARON.

664
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:23,631
ONE VOTE JANET, ONE VOTE AARON.

665
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,299
AARON.

666
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:31,598
TWO VOTES AARON, ONE VOTE JANET.

667
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:38,271
THAT'S THREE VOTES AARON, ONE
VOTE JANET.

668
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,607
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

669
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,816
AARON.

670
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:48,948
THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

671
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:54,120
>> I TOLD YOU IT'S AARON.

672
00:31:54,203 --> 00:32:02,003
>> Jeff: AARON, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

673
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,298
AARON, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE
Añ;SPOT ON THE JURY.

674
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,007
ALL RIGHT.

675
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,342
YOU GUYS CAN HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

676
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,260
WE'LL BRING IN THE NEXT GROUP.

677
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,890
>> YOU KNOW, I KIND OF
ANTICIPATED THIS WOULD HAPPEN AT

678
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,183
SOME POINT IN TIME.

679
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,685
I TRIED TO DELAY IT AS MUCH AS I
COULD BY WINNING THE INDIVIDUAL

680
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,936
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.

681
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,396
THEY HAD TO GET RID OF ME.

682
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,898
NOW WAS THE RIGHT TIME.

683
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:22,565
KUDOS TO THEM.

684
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,691
HATS OFF.

685
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,861
I'LL SIT MY BUTT ON THE JURY.

686
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,217
>> GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK AT
OUR NEW JURY MEMBER.

687
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,885
AARON VOTED OUT MINUTES AGO.

688
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,720
ELIZABETH, YOUR FACE SAYS IT
ALL.

689
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,389
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND
RIGHT THIS MOMENT?

690
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,392
>> MY HEART IS BEATING REALLY
HARD.

691
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:02,021
AARON WAS ONE OF MY NUMBER ONES.

692
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,190
THIS SUCKS.

693
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:13,408
YEAH, THAT'S NOT REALLY --.

694
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,535
>> Jeff: THAT'S AN INTERESTING
THING.

695
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,039
YOU WERE REALLY SNEAKY BY
SEPARATING US AND KEEPING US

696
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:20,915
APART.

697
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:25,044
GAME PLAN GOT SWITCHED WITHOUT
US KNOWING.

698
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,047
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH, WHAT
HAPPENED AFTER THE CHALLENGE

699
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,967
WHEN YOU GO BACK THE CAMP,
ELAINE HAS IMMUNITY, AND NOW YOU

700
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,135
HAVE TO START TALKING.

701
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,762
>> THERE WAS DEFINITELY CHAOS
AROUND CAMP, BUT I FEEL GOOD

702
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,015
ABOUT THE PLAN THAT I WAS A PART
OF.

703
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,643
I'M HOPING THAT'S THE ONE THAT
GOES THROUGH TONIGHT.

704
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,104
>> Jeff: MISSY, IS THAT WHAT
YOU EXPERIENCED, AS WELL IN.

705
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,857
>> I EXPERIENCED A LOT FROM
KARISHMA TODAY.

706
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,400
WE HAD QUITE A TRIP TODAY.

707
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,985
AND I WASN'T A GOOD ONE.

708
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:49,819
SO, YEAH.

709
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,778
IT WAS PRETTY BAD.

710
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,614
>> Jeff: KARISHMA, WHAT IS
MISSY REFERRING TO.

711
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,285
>> MISSY AND I HAVE BEEN BUTTING
HEADS FOR SOME TIME, NOT A

712
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,746
SECRET TO ANYONE HERE.

713
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,664
IT'S JUST -- EMOTIONS ARE REALLY
HIGH.

714
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,251
I LIKE TO JUST SAY MY PIECE,
WALK AWAY, AND LET IT CALM DOWN,

715
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:09,839
BUT THERE WERE TIMES WHERE MISSY
WANTED TO ESCALATE THINGS OR

716
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,842
WANTED TO SAY THINGS THAT I
DIDN'T FEEL WERE NECESSARY IN

717
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,426
THE GAME.

718
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,344
>> TIME OUT.

719
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,222
THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR," WHEN YOU
CALL SOMEONE A THREAT, THE

720
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:22,310
THINGS YOU SAY ARE, JAMAL FINDS
IDOL, HE'S ATHLETIC, HE'S A

721
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,102
THREAT.

722
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,270
KELLEE IS SOCIAL, SHE'S A
THREAT.

723
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:29,150
YOU DO NOT SAY, OH, SHE'S A
BULLY, SHE NEEDS TO LEAVE THE

724
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,819
GAME BECAUSE SHEA XI YELLS AT ME
AND SHE'S AGGRESSIVE.

725
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:36,324
>> Jeff: YOU ARE SAYING YOU'VE
BEEN LABELED THOSE THINGS?

726
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,784
-100 FACT.

727
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,660
FOR ME, I AM NOT THAT.

728
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,287
THAT'S NOT ME.

729
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,166
>> Jeff: KARISHMA IS MISSY
CORRECT, YOU LOOK AT HER AS A

730
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,335
BULLY OR AGGRESSIVE, THE WORD
SHE USED?

731
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,712
>> THERE ARE TIMES I DO, YES.

732
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:54,008
>> JEFF, I KNOW WHO I AM, AND
WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR, I'M

733
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:54,842
HAPPY EVERY MORNING.

734
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:55,676
I ACCEPT MYSELF.

735
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,761
DO YOU?

736
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:01,516
>> I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT
SAYING I ACCEPT WHO I AM IS

737
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,725
100%.

738
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,686
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE
CLASH, BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE EYE

739
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,813
TO EYE.

740
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,022
>> Jeff: IS PART OF THIS
DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT

741
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:11,192
WALKS OF LIFE WHO SEE THE WORLD
DIFFERENTLY AND THEY'RE NEVER

742
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,026
GOING TO AGREE?

743
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:14,028
>> I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT COMES
DOWN.

744
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,197
TO GETTING TO KNOW KARISHMA,
SHE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON.

745
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,032
KNOWING MISSY, SHE'S AN
INCREDIBLE PERSON.

746
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:21,869
I THINK THEY JUST BOTH VIEW SO
DIFFERENTLY THAT THEY'RE NEVER

747
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,704
GOING TO BE ABLE TO COINCIDE.

748
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,542
>> BUT I WAS THERE WITH MISSY
AND KARISHMA TODAY, AND I

749
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,210
THOUGHT IT WENT FANTASTIC.

750
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:34,132
I THINK WE BRIDGED THE GAP
BETWEEN BOAT OF THEIR

751
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,341
PERSONALITIES.

752
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,677
>> AND KARISHMA, I UNDERSTAND
NOT WANTING PEOPLE TO VOTE YOU

753
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,347
OUT, SO YOU LIE, BUT I'VE ALWAYS
TOLD YOU I WOULD LOVE TO WORK

754
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,473
WITH YOU.

755
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,852
>> Jeff: ELAINE, DO YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT MISSY IS SAYING?

756
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,397
>> JEFF, THEY GOT ME SO TWISTED,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

757
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,566
BUT WHO AM I TO SAY ANYTHING.

758
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,401
THE BEEF IS BETWEEN THE TWO OF
THEM.

759
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,572
THE ONLY WAY TO SQUASH IT IS TO
SEND SOMEBODY HOME HONESTLY.

760
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,906
>> WE'RE READY TO VOTE.

761
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,241
>> REAL QUICK.

762
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,201
I LOVE YOU.

763
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:06,080
BUT THE OTHER DAY TWO AFRICAN
AMERICANS WORE THE NECKLACE AT

764
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:09,250
THE SAME TIME AND AT OUR TRIBAL
THERE WAS NO MENTION OF IT AT

765
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:09,917
ALL.

766
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,252
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.

767
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,254
WOMEN TYPICALLY ARE THE FIRST
VOTED OUT.

768
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,505
MINORITIES ARE THE SECOND.

769
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:19,302
SO TO HAVE TWO MINORITIES ON THE
SAME DAY IN A DOUBLE CHALLENGE

770
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:24,432
WEAR THE NECKLACE, THAT'S JUST
SOMETHING THAT I FEEL LIKE

771
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,436
REPRESENTATION MATTERS, AND I
FEEL LIKE MY FUTURE NIECES AND

772
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,149
NEPHEWS AND MY FUTURE OTHER
FAMILY MEMBERS NEED TO SEE THAT,

773
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,026
BECAUSE WE'RE HERE, TOO.

774
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,237
>> Jeff: MISSY, I GOT TO SAY,
I LOVE THAT YOU BROUGHT IT UP.

775
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,698
I'M NOT SURE IF I WOULD HAVE
HIGHLIGHTED IT.

776
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:44,327
IT ACTUALLY NEVER OCCURRED TO
ME, BUT I WOULD HAVE BEEN

777
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,414
RELUCTANT TO FOR FEAR OF SAYING,
WOW, LIKE IT'S SOMETHING YOU

778
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,582
WOULDN'T EXPECT TO HAPPEN.

779
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,376
SO EVEN I'M LEARNING RIGHT NOW
THAT ALL OF THESE ROADS THAT

780
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,838
WE'RE TRYING TO WEAVE TO GET
ALONG IN HARMONY ARE FRAUGHT

781
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,590
WITH THEIR OWN PITFALLS.

782
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:01,677
SO I APPRECIATE YOU SPEAKING UP.

783
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:06,307
AND NOW ONCE AGAIN WE'RE GOING
TO GO FROM SOMETHING THAT SEEMS

784
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,811
OUTSIDE OF THE GAME AND WE'RE
GOING TO GET RIGHT BACK INTO

785
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,688
NAMES ON A PARCHMENT.

786
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,981
ALL RIGHT.

787
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,817
PER YOUR WISH, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.

788
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:25,993
ELIZABETH, YOU'RE UP.

789
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:36,087
>> WHEN YOU BRING UP MY NAME,
YOU PACK YOUR BAGS.

790
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:49,892
>> WHEN YOU BRING UP MY NAME,
YOU PACK YOUR BAGS.

791
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:59,986
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES..

792
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:07,243
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES..

793
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,538
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

794
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,039
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

795
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,707
OKAY.

796
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,875
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

797
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:19,380
FIRST VOTE, MISSY.

798
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,047
TOMMY.

799
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,510
ONE VOTE MISSY, ONE VOTE TOMMY.

800
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,344
TOMMY.

801
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:32,560
THAT'S TWO VOTES TOMMY, ONE VOTE
MISSY.

802
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,060
MISSY.

803
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:33,811
WE'RE TIED.

804
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,731
TWO VOTES MISSY, TWO VOTES
TOMMY.

805
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:44,196
ONE VOTE LEFT.

806
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,034
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FIFTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

807
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,244
MISSY.

808
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:54,373
>> YO, WHO DID IT?

809
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,374
>> YOU CAME AFTER ME.

810
00:38:55,458 --> 00:39:02,089
>> I DIDN'T COME AFTER YOU.

811
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,632
>> OH, MY GOD.

812
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,136
>> OH, DAMN.

813
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,971
THAT WAS DOPE, THOUGH, Y'ALL.

814
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,098
THAT'S NOT MINE.

815
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,981
>> WAS IT YOU?

816
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,566
THAT'S WILD.

817
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,235
>> MISSY, FROM HERE, DIFFERENCES
AND ALL GIRL.

818
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,654
>> YOU KNOW I WAS KEEPING YOU
FOR THE END.

819
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:37,917
>> EVERYBODY IS KEEPING KARISHMA
FOR THE END.

820
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,002
>> COME ON, MISSY, IT'S OVER.

821
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,344
>> ALL RIGHT, JEFF, COME ON,
MAN.

822
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:52,973
>> MISSY --
>> JEFF!

823
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,309
>> Jeff: THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

824
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,310
DANG, ELAINE, I KNEW IT.

825
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:57,311
ALL RIGHT.

826
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:58,562
I'LL SEE YOU ALL LATER.

827
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,480
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AT 8:00.

828
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,607
>> LOVE YOU, MISS.

829
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:10,491
>> BYE, MISSY.

830
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:15,663
>> Jeff: WELL, WE ARE 27 DAYS
IN TO A 39-DAY GAME, AND THE

831
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:21,001
FOOT HAS NOT COME OFF THE PEDDLE
FOR EVEN A MOMENT.

832
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,711
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

833
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,087
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

834
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,966
GOOD NIGHT.

835
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,348
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

access.wgbh.org

837
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:43,190
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

838
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,030
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," WHEN ANIMALS

839
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:50,489
ATTACK...

840
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:50,990
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

841
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,033
>> HE BIT MY FINGER.

842
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,703
>> Jeff: ...YOU'LL NEED TO
TRAVEL IN A PACK.

843
00:40:55,786 --> 00:41:01,041
>> ATTENTION, REPORT FOR DUTY.

844
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,502
>> Jeff: TO REACH THE TOP OF
THE FOOD CHAIN.

845
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,880
>> THIS IS GOING THE CHANGE MY
GAME.

846
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,009
>> ON A SCALE OF DOPINESS,
GETTING BLINDSIDED, THAT'S

847
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,011
NEGATIVELY DOPE, AND I DIDN'T
EVEN NOTICE.

848
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:15,181
SO THAT'S A BIG ENOUGH FAULT IN
MY GAME WHERE I DESERVE TO BE

849
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,017
HERE, BUT IT'S FINE.

850
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,601
LIFE GOES ON.

851
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,810
IT'S IN THE A BRAIN TUMOR.

852
