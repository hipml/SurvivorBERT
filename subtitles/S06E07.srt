00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,920
JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,256
<i>Tambaqui returned from</i>
<i>Tribal Council vowing to unite.</i>

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,551
We have to go forward
as a new team.

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,885
PROBST:
<i>And at Jaburu,</i>

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,429
<i>Shawna blossomed</i>
<i>in the company of men...</i>

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,598
The guys saved me
from the women.

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,891
PROBST:
<i>...especially Alex.</i>

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,394
Okay, you know, Shawna, that I'm
not gonna ever tell you to stop.

9
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,437
SHAWNA:<i> I want to get</i>
<i>to know him better.</i>

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,230
He is an incredible person.

11
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,023
-Go.
-PROBST:<i> Led by Christy,</i>

12
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,067
<i>Tambaqui rolled to victory</i>
<i>at the reward challenge.</i>

13
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,946
-Tambaqui!
-Tambaqui!

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,450
<i>At Jaburu, Rob and Deena</i>
<i>formed an alliance of two.</i>

15
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,619
DEENA:<i> Rob approached me and</i>
<i>he said, "I need some help."</i>

16
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,122
And I said,
"Listen, I need some help."

17
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,624
PROBST:
<i>Tambaqui was victorious</i>

18
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,251
<i>for a second straight</i>
<i>challenge.</i>

19
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,252
Tambaqui wins immunity!

20
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,005
<i>So Jaburu</i>
<i>went to Tribal Council,</i>

21
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,257
<i>where Alex looked on as</i>
<i>Shawna became the sixth person</i>

22
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,968
<i>voted out of the Amazon.</i>

23
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>Ten are left.</i>

24
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,890
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

25
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:07,252
(footsteps approaching)

26
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,212
Don't step on the fire,
everyone.

27
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,213
What's that?

28
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,091
Don't step on the fire.

29
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,342
DEENA:<i> Tribal Council</i>
<i>tonight was awful.</i>

30
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,886
<i>Shawna is gone.</i>

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,721
Somebody's gonna have to
do fire shift by themselves.

32
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,889
<i>You know, we miss</i>

33
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,558
that extra little spark,

34
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,351
the extra little bandana
with the sunglasses.

35
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,729
I hate Tribal Council.

36
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,608
I feel physically, mentally
and emotionally exhausted.

37
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,235
ROB:
<i>Alex, I think, is a little bit</i>

38
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,738
depressed that Shawna
is not here anymore.

39
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,782
<i>And I'll be honest,</i>
<i>it's not the same</i>

40
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,284
<i>not having another, uh,</i>

41
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,579
<i>23-year-old girl</i>
<i>in a bikini around, but</i>

42
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,914
maybe he'll get his head out
of his ass and start thinking

43
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,999
about the game again,
like he should be.

44
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,752
As a team, do you guys think
it's a good idea for

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,922
the three guys-- should we have
a merger-- to go back

46
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,592
to the other three guys and say
that, that we kept their plan

47
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,303
all along and kept
all the guys together,

48
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,306
and that's why
Shawna got voted out?

49
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,891
But then you're just gonna
pick us girls off.

50
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,601
No, but we're not really
gonna do that.

51
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,935
We're just gonna tell them.

52
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,272
Then you guys can also
get the two girls to vote.

53
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,483
See, Heidi, I have confidence
in; Christy, I do not.

54
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,945
You guys would have to
get Heidi, then we'd be able

55
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,781
to split up their vote
and we could knock off Dave.

56
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,782
Mm-hmm.

57
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,451
This is just our insurance

58
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,660
to make sure it's not
gonna be a five-five tie.

59
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,454
It's kind of, uh, deceptive,
though, and it's only a sug--

60
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,081
it's only a suggestion.

61
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,124
ROB:
<i>I don't like having to</i>

62
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,335
<i>discuss strategy</i>
<i>in an open forum,</i>

63
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,462
<i>but should there be a merger</i>
<i>in the next three days,</i>

64
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,464
I just wanted to make sure that

65
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,591
all these knuckleheads
understand the plan.

66
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,967
Alex, are you
comfortable with that?

67
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,093
Absolutely.

68
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,262
This is my thinking.

69
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,474
Dave is probably the physically
strongest out of everyone.

70
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,602
I'm concerned that,
what-what if it never...?

71
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,604
If we give him the opportunity
to win immunity,

72
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,147
-he'll take it.
-Yes. Yes.

73
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:51,731
That's fine with me.

74
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,983
If we can pinch Dave,

75
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,485
then the whole house of cards
is gonna crumble.

76
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,486
-Yep.
-Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,488
<i>Once we have that majority,</i>

78
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,824
it's-- "Roger, shut up.

79
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,867
"Shut up, Roger.

80
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,160
Stop talking, Roger."

81
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,538
<i>And finally, the shoe</i>
<i>will be on the other foot.</i>

82
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,539
And it's gonna feel really good.

83
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,916
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

84
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,751
That's gonna be
a highlight of my game.

85
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,180
(chittering)

86
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,647
Welcome. You have treemail.

87
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,525
You have made my experience here
so much more enjoyable.

88
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,694
Hopefully,
I'll be here all week.

89
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,737
Okay, I opened it last time.
You go.

90
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,700
-Here it is.
-The key! The key!

91
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,243
Go!

92
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:45,618
-Go!
-Go!

93
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,536
It says...

94
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,247
(shouting excitedly)

95
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,040
DEENA:<i> Now, mind you,</i>
<i>there's been this box</i>

96
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,834
<i>inside of our supplies</i>

97
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,585
since day one.

98
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,878
And it drives everybody nuts.

99
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,047
You know, you shake it,
you throw it, you drop it,

100
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,257
you want to know what's inside.

101
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,758
BUTCH:
<i>We were all excited</i>

102
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,218
<i>because we got to open</i>

103
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:02,719
the box.

104
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,388
(humming fanfare)

105
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,807
<i>We speculated for 18 days</i>
<i>what was in there.</i>

106
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,350
Huh.

107
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,560
Boy, isn't that great.

108
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,731
"You started men and women,
then mixed it up for fun,

109
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:20,903
For those who survive 19 days,
it's time to live as one..."

110
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,531
"Paddle to your new location,
leave your old life behind,

111
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,950
"Take your water,
machete and personal pack

112
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,077
In the brand-new world
you're about to find."

113
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,079
-Oh, we gotta build
a new shelter? -Yeah.

114
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,414
-That sucks.
-Hey.

115
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,124
-Pack 'em up, kids.
-Whatever!

116
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,751
DEENA:
<i>The note clearly says:</i>

117
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,087
"Now you should become one,"
and we're off.

118
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,547
It's over.

119
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,549
It is a merger.

120
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,633
-Anybody kind of nervous?
-Yes.

121
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,011
But you know what?
We're here.

122
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:45,678
We're down with Jaburu, right?

123
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,722
-Hell, yes.
-We're here.

124
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,890
Yeah, you guys have really...

125
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,767
Dave, Roger, Butch.

126
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,977
Amen to that, sister.

127
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:53,936
And don't ever let them see

128
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,731
the five of us
talking at one, at one time.

129
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,815
-I agree.
-They'll suspect something's up.

130
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,983
-Okay.
-Is everybody okay with that?

131
00:05:59,067 --> 00:05:59,692
We're all okay,
okay with that, right?

132
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,611
-Absolutely.
-Stick to it.

133
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,904
All for one.

134
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,113
ALL:
One for all.

135
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:04,572
Jenna, thanks for bringing us
all together.

136
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,616
Oh, no problem.

137
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,784
Word up.

138
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,785
-Peace out.
-Okay.

139
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,787
Good-bye, camp.

140
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,460
Bye, home.

141
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,461
-Bye, home.
-Bye-bye. -Bye.

142
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,462
It was a good time,

143
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,799
neat place, good friendship.

144
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,301
I'll never forget it,
long as I live.

145
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,469
Bye-bye.

146
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,553
Here we go.

147
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,782
Come on in, guys!

148
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,159
Right up nice and tight,
right in here.

149
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,290
Make sure you get
all your stuff.

150
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,251
You're not coming back
to these boats.

151
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,469
Okay, as you guys know
from your treemail today,

152
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:13,141
the tribes of Jaburu and
Tambaqui will merge into one.

153
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:17,186
You started this as a tribe
of women and a tribe of men.

154
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,896
You then integrated
into two new tribes.

155
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,358
Today, you will form one
final tribe and you will live

156
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:25,862
with this tribe for the rest
of your days in the Amazon.

157
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,864
The game also changes
at this point.

158
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,365
It is now an individual game.

159
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,284
All challenges are individual--

160
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,661
individual reward,
individual immunity.

161
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,248
You can can take off your buffs
and drop them.

162
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,041
Jaburu and Tambaqui are no more.

163
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,710
New buffs.

164
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,627
New tribe color.

165
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,547
You will also have a new home.

166
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,049
That means, once again,

167
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,593
you're gonna have to
craft a new shelter.

168
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,887
When you arrive at your new
home, you must also come up with

169
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,724
a new tribe name
and paint your new tribe flag.

170
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,517
This is a map to your new home.

171
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,352
Everything you need will be
waiting for you

172
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,395
at your new camp.

173
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,773
You have a boat to assist you
in your journey.

174
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:06,194
I wish you good luck
for your final days.

175
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,112
Let's head out.
As you guys are heading

176
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,655
to your boat,
you can say your hellos

177
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,282
and all that stuff from back on.

178
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,284
Feels like I've known you
from day one.

179
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,535
I saw you the first time...

180
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,912
Hi, I'm Rob.

181
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,121
(all chattering)

182
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,456
CHRISTY:
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

183
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,918
I made it to the merger.

184
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,920
I j-- I... Wow.

185
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,088
Oh, nice to meet you.

186
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,759
DAVE:<i> The surge of,</i>
<i>we've been battling one another</i>

187
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,052
and-and trying
not to be eliminated

188
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,095
and trying to get
to this point of the game

189
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,431
<i>and we've-we've succeeded,</i>
<i>it's fantastic.</i>

190
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:35,765
<i>We're here right now.</i>

191
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,641
It's done.

192
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,539
-Oh!
-Whoo!

193
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,000
ROGER:<i> We arrive here</i>
<i>and, lo and behold,</i>

194
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,629
<i>when we get off the boat,</i>
<i>there is a feast</i>

195
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,297
to end all feasts
laid out for us.

196
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,131
Is there chocolate?

197
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,050
Look at that-- salsa!

198
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:11,801
It's chocolate cookies!

199
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,969
Oh, my God!

200
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,970
There are burgers!

201
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,971
I'm betting...

202
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,806
Wait, wait.
What's in here?

203
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,766
-(cheering, shouting)
-Hot dogs!

204
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,731
(excited chattering)

205
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,774
Potato salad.

206
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,318
Here's some, uh, slaw.

207
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,528
Oh...

208
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,821
Give me a burger.

209
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,155
Burger right here.

210
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,949
(excited chattering)

211
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,492
Here you go!

212
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:37,076
DAVE:
<i>We're at a new point.</i>

213
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,453
<i>It's new people.</i>

214
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,121
It's new friendships to be made.

215
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,872
And it's just-- it was just

216
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,332
<i>a flurry of excitement.</i>

217
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,002
<i>Nobody's thinking about who's</i>
<i>going off next, at that point.</i>

218
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,752
<i>They're thinking,</i>
<i>we are blessed</i>

219
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,671
<i>to have this meal right now.</i>

220
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,506
Let's celebrate.

221
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:50,881
-Yeah!
-Who wants a beer?

222
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,342
(cheering)

223
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,011
Hey, here's to the new tribe
and here's to new friends.

224
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,179
Yay!

225
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,015
-Cheers.
-Cheers to you all.

226
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,933
Congratulations, final ten.

227
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,148
-Let's take it slow and really
enjoy it, guys. -You know it.

228
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,065
So what about our name?

229
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,319
We have some ideas
for a new tribe name.

230
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,653
-Jacaré.
-Jacaré.

231
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,738
Which is Portuguese
for "alligator."

232
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,864
For "caiman." Alligator.

233
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,032
-And "crocodile."
-That's not bad.

234
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,074
I have no other suggestion.

235
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,159
-I'm fine.
-A tribe is born.

236
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,369
-Jacaré. -Jacaré.
-Jacaré. -Jacaré.

237
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,495
Good salsa, too.

238
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,042
-I don't want to get up.
-I don't want to get up, either.

239
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,043
I'm eating chips, man.

240
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,169
Hand me a dog.

241
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,378
What has he been saying?

242
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,379
Ah, we'll talk later.

243
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,049
-All right.
-No, it's my, it's my favorite.

244
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,468
ROGER:<i> We had a tendency</i>
<i>for the whole group</i>

245
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,178
<i>to kind of get, you know,</i>

246
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,722
<i>let's be festive</i>
<i>all afternoon, forgetting</i>

247
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,932
the fact that we had to get
a shelter built.

248
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,851
Did we decide
we're gonna put the, uh,

249
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:48,064
the chips and the bread
and stuff in the basket?

250
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:48,898
That'll work.

251
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,233
Hey, you can pack the beer.

252
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,360
-Here.
-Use that inside the pack.

253
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,736
Why don't you just...

254
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,738
Here, I'll use my raincoat
for the beer, also.

255
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,115
Well, it sure is not a priority.

256
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,575
Mine's not gonna fit in there.
It's too heavy.

257
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,743
ROGER:
<i>And my focus was,</i>

258
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,038
we got to keep the food,
you know, iced up.

259
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,123
<i>Well, the guys got into this,</i>

260
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,958
<i>"Well, let's make</i>
<i>a special deal,</i>

261
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,587
<i>put the beer in there, make</i>
<i>sure we got that iced down."</i>

262
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,465
And I, and I really--
I was really getting ticked off.

263
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,095
-Take it, take it.
-It's good cold beer, Roger.

264
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,763
We're going to drink it here
in just a little bit.

265
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,807
Butch, you need beer like a hole
in the head and you know it.

266
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,559
Well, it's something
that we don't like...

267
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,144
-So it's warm, so it's warm!
-All right, Rog.

268
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,605
-Not that big a deal, Roger.
-Here we go.

269
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:33,275
ALEX:<i> The problem with Roger</i>
<i>is that he's an ass.</i>

270
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,778
He's loud, he obnoxious,
he's bossy.

271
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,989
<i>He thinks he knows everything.</i>

272
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:39,990
<i>And he wants to be</i>
<i>the dictator,</i>

273
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,450
<i>wants to be the leader.</i>

274
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,953
<i>And what he thought was</i>
<i>important took precedence.</i>

275
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,579
And he's yelling at everybody.

276
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,458
We want to assign, uh... duties.

277
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,214
Now, we're not that far
from the water right here.

278
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,799
We are up high.

279
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,925
It's a little bit of a gamble,

280
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,301
as Roger and I
were talking about.

281
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,637
It's a little bit of a gamble
to stay right here.

282
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,013
I was a little concerned
about that

283
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,015
150 feet thing
that you're supposed to be from

284
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,642
the water's edge
for the whole crocodile...

285
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,393
Have you seen down there?

286
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,145
-It looks fairly swampy.
-I know.

287
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,313
We can move up there
or we can stay here.

288
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,816
My only suggestion is this:
if we're going to stay here,

289
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,985
I would rather the fire
be over there.

290
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,278
What, to keep the caiman away?

291
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,529
-Yes.
-Just to keep the caiman away.

292
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,364
Doesn't have to be a big blazer,
doesn't have to go all the time.

293
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,532
It really isn't necessary.

294
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,366
The caiman are not
going to come up here.

295
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,994
My-My training was,
yes, they do.

296
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,370
-Right.
-Uh-huh.

297
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,833
ROB:<i> There is a lot of tension</i>
<i>between Deena and Roger.</i>

298
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,002
<i>Roger was in charge</i>
<i>of Tambaqui,</i>

299
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,338
<i>and Deena was</i>
<i>the leader of Jaburu.</i>

300
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,009
And Deena is a very strong woman
who I have a lot of respect for.

301
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,635
<i>She's a lawyer.</i>

302
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,514
<i>She can argue her way out of</i>
<i>just about any situation,</i>

303
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,349
and Roger loves
to hear himself talk.

304
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,185
This-- it's so different.

305
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,187
You know, we're not that much
further from the water.

306
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,480
We're a little bit higher.

307
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,317
The differential there, I don't
think really gains us anything.

308
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,985
ROB:
<i>So you get these two together--</i>

309
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,153
<i>Roger thinks</i>
<i>that women are stupid,</i>

310
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,447
<i>Deena thinks that women</i>
<i>are better than men,</i>

311
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,199
<i>and there's just about</i>
<i>a million</i>

312
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,034
different conversations they
could, they could go off on.

313
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,329
At night, the caiman go
into the water.

314
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,079
All right,
so we're staying here, cool.

315
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,332
All right, cool.

316
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,042
Just wanted, I just wanted
everyone to be part of that.

317
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,170
-Yay!
-Hey!

318
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,720
The roof will be like this.

319
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,930
That will be the end.

320
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,097
But then, that-that-that
causes us a problem,

321
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,934
palm frond lengthwise.

322
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,685
It's not going to be,
you know, the same,

323
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,604
but I think it's really
got to be the way...

324
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,272
That's a pretty good long
straight one.

325
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,858
Oh, you know that song
"Hallelujah, It's Raining Men"?

326
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,735
You know, God love 'em.

327
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,445
<i>You need 'em. You need--</i>

328
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,863
<i>"All right,</i>
<i>getting the shelter together."</i>

329
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,073
<i>Roger said, "Okay,</i>

330
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,241
<i>"here we're going to</i>
<i>establish our floor</i>

331
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,867
<i>"and our base</i>
<i>and our perimeter,</i>

332
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,744
<i>"and roar, roar, roar, roar.</i>

333
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,413
And you two,
you two go get palm fronds."

334
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,416
Um, can I start
putting the floorboards down?

335
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,085
Well, we got that;
we have that under control.

336
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,296
Helping Rob split the fronds
would be really great.

337
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,047
Okay?

338
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,258
For the roof.

339
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,134
In here.

340
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,678
CHRISTY:<i> I'm not working</i>
<i>on the shelter because</i>

341
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:10,057
it's a "man" thing to do
or I'm not strong or...

342
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,061
If you don't have the
mathematical set, frame, plan

343
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,064
like they have it--
which really pisses me off,

344
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,233
because I really would
like to be a part of it.

345
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,777
<i>I mean, if I'm out here</i>
<i>pulling palm fronds and logs</i>

346
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,738
<i>and really trying to be a team,</i>
<i>I want to be able to</i>

347
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,324
<i>put a log on there</i>
<i>and measure it and say, "Hey,"</i>

348
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,578
<i>and feel like I made the bed</i>
<i>as well as they did.</i>

349
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,079
But I'm cool.
You know, if I can get

350
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,123
the palm fronds done
and have a little shelter

351
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,667
before the rain comes,
then okay, I'll be happy.

352
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,630
It sucks, right?

353
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,257
I know the boys
can drink, right?

354
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,134
"And only, only two can
get palm fronds."

355
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,637
I don't know. I'm a pretty good
damn palm-frond-getter myself.

356
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,600
I really want to put
the rest of the ice

357
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,643
on top of the beer,
but I'm so afraid.

358
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,604
Don't be afraid.
Will you quit being afraid?

359
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,646
ROB:
<i>Coming into this merger,</i>

360
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,983
it's interesting to see
what everybody is doing.

361
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,194
<i>Some people are busy</i>
<i>building the shelter.</i>

362
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,657
<i>Other people, like myself,</i>
<i>are busy building alliances</i>

363
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,993
<i>and working towards</i>
<i>the end of the game.</i>

364
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,537
<i>We'll see if you guys,</i>
<i>that are building the shelter,</i>

365
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,496
<i>are all going to be here</i>

366
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,458
to use it for more than
six or nine days.

367
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,463
But you understand
what we have to do.

368
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,798
We have to start picking off
the stronger males.

369
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,508
Yeah, but please
let Roger go first.

370
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,676
-Please.
-Oh, no, no, no.

371
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,927
No. No, no.

372
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,054
I don't care
what you want after that.

373
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,807
But then after Roger, who?

374
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,726
I don't know,
but he's gotta go.

375
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,187
Dave and Matt
are the strongest men.

376
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,313
They're the most threatening.

377
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,981
I know that
they're both nice guys,

378
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,359
but now it becomes
a different game.

379
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,860
But Roger has got to go first.

380
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:47,029
Because what will happen is,
if he gets on the jury,

381
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,614
and then, say, just me or you--

382
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,698
okay, any of the girls--

383
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,532
-he will vote against us.
-Against.

384
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,534
So-- and there's
no doubt in my mind.

385
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,037
He is a hard-core male
all the way.

386
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,540
DEENA:<i> My initial thing was,</i>
<i>let's get rid of Dave.</i>

387
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,501
<i>He clearly is</i>
<i>one of the strongest,</i>

388
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,252
<i>if not the strongest out here.</i>

389
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,590
Jenna and Heidi
had a good point--

390
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,884
gotta give them their due--
they said, "Listen...

391
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:12,680
<i>if we were to allow Roger</i>
<i>to be on the jury,</i>

392
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,392
<i>he would never ever</i>
<i>vote for a female."</i>

393
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,726
<i>Simply because we have</i>
<i>breasts and estrogen,</i>

394
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,398
<i>we must be, somehow, so far</i>
<i>inferior to that of a man.</i>

395
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,440
They're right. Screw him.

396
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,568
-Uh, we're, uh...
-Uh, we'll need something else.

397
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,237
-Just like old times, you know.
-Yup.

398
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,572
The six of us building a shelter
together. It...

399
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,533
-Hey, guys. -Yeah, we were just
talking-- the guys

400
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,284
and I, and we think
it's just a little too easy.

401
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,955
We got six guys and four girls,
and our original game plan was,

402
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,791
the six guys against...
against the, uh...

403
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,752
against the girls,
and, you know,

404
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,420
it should be,
just pick 'em off.

405
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,589
And it just seems too easy.

406
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,427
Uh, something probably is going
to happen here. I...

407
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,637
I'm not that...
I'm not that confident yet.

408
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,263
We'll see.

409
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,266
Yeah.

410
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,559
DAVE:
<i>The initial plan, right now,</i>

411
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:03,230
<i>is for the six guys</i>
<i>to eliminate the four girls,</i>

412
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:07,109
<i>and I am going to vote</i>
<i>for Christy, because it seems</i>

413
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,360
that's the way
the old alliance is voting.

414
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,655
<i>And if I were her,</i>
<i>I'd be really worried,</i>

415
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,782
<i>and I think Deena also saw</i>
<i>herself in that position</i>

416
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,659
<i>because she's been butting</i>
<i>heads with Roger,</i>

417
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,493
<i>and she knows that Roger</i>

418
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,328
kind of has his alliance
on one side.

419
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,790
(thunder rumbling)

420
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,418
(birds chirping)

421
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,632
Yeah.

422
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,134
If we don't make it,
we don't make it.

423
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,385
This one we know doesn't reach,
so go to this one?

424
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,805
ALEX:<i> Roger is of the belief</i>
<i>that we are all, um...</i>

425
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,308
<i>all the guys are together</i>
<i>and, um...</i>

426
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,519
The fact of the matter is, um,
Roger's first...

427
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,021
-Well, Roger's...
-MATT: The second.

428
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,814
-No, he's first on the list now.
-MATT: Is he?

429
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,066
-The list has changed.
-MATT: Okay.

430
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,902
He was being an ass earlier, so
Roger's gonna be, uh, voted on.

431
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,611
Unless he wins
individual immunity,

432
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,821
he'll be the first one to go.

433
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,865
Butch, don't forget your water.

434
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:55,449
BUTCH:
What?

435
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,326
Don't forget your water.

436
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,953
MATT:<i> This is a tough game,</i>
<i>and you have to</i>

437
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,790
<i>identify people you can trust</i>
<i>and stick with them,</i>

438
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,667
<i>and we're very comfortable</i>
<i>with our alliance.</i>

439
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,419
<i>We think it's going</i>
<i>to hold true</i>

440
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,171
to the end.

441
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,380
-And then when it's the
five of us, uh... -Yeah.

442
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,633
...we'll sort it out
amongst ourselves.

443
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,258
MATT:
Exactly.

444
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,435
(all talking at once)

445
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,858
A can of beer
and a cell phone.

446
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,236
-Can of beer...
-(overlapping chatter)

447
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,863
-Particularly if we get soft.
-Silver bullet.

448
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,824
-Yeah, right here.
-Cheers. -Cheers. -Salud.

449
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,866
To the ten.

450
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,868
-Jacaré.
-ROB:<i> Camp is very festive.</i>

451
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,870
<i>And everybody</i>
<i>is hanging out except</i>

452
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,873
<i>for one man,</i>
<i>who's passed out,</i>

453
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,875
<i>sleeping and snoring.</i>

454
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,752
And it happens
to be the same guy

455
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,879
that everybody wants
to vote off.

456
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,881
-(snoring) -HEIDI: I was
so nervous coming here.

457
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,883
ROB:<i> I'm disappointed that none</i>
<i>of the girls are really</i>

458
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,885
<i>drinking that much.</i>
<i>That's a problem</i>

459
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,263
<i>when you're a guy</i>
<i>that looks like me.</i>

460
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,889
<i>I realize the only chance</i>
<i>I have with either</i>

461
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,058
<i>of those two girls is</i>
<i>if they get really drunk.</i>

462
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:06,520
But otherwise, it's still
pretty crazy in there.

463
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,106
Now where is the weirdest place
that you've ever had sex?

464
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,524
CHRISTY:
I'd have to say

465
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,610
Fourth of July
at the Washington Monument.

466
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,237
Fireworks.

467
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,407
Score. Yeah.

468
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,908
Not bad.

469
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,119
DAVE:<i> We talked great sex talk</i>
<i>last night.</i>

470
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:26,123
Just swapping stories like,
like friends, uh, back home.

471
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,917
So I'm back there
with these two chicks, and, uh,

472
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,544
I looked at this chick,
and I'm, like,

473
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,713
"I dare you to eat this off
of my stomach."

474
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,589
And she's, like, "All right."

475
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,549
So you put the ice cube
on the belly,

476
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,427
gets eaten off. So she's, like,
"Well, I dare you

477
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,596
to eat this out of my chest."
So I ate this ice cube

478
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,723
out of her chest,
and then this one girl...

479
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,600
ROB:
<i>I really dislike Dave.</i>

480
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,437
He thinks he's very slick
and very smart,

481
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,940
and he thinks
he's a real ladies' man.

482
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,444
<i>So it's very possible</i>
<i>that he could try to coerce</i>

483
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,237
<i>one of these girls</i>
<i>into voting with him,</i>

484
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,615
<i>and I just hope</i>
<i>that all these girls</i>

485
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,617
<i>are solid enough to stand up</i>

486
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,954
to this rocket scientist and his
stupid all-American charm.

487
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,456
Rob-a-sue...

488
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,793
My-My, uh, sex life,
if you even would call it that,

489
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,296
is so... is so mundane.

490
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,341
Like, I've got so many crazy
ideas in my head, that...

491
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,636
<i>Unfortunately, I don't have</i>
<i>that many good sex stories.</i>

492
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,348
I hardly have
any boring sex stories.

493
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:28,268
<i>Most of my sex stories usually</i>
<i>involve me and a fat girl.</i>

494
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,062
And then both girls were there
at the same time,

495
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,814
and it was really weird
that both girls knew

496
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,149
that-that something
was going on.

497
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,652
-And, uh, like, I was...
-Dude, you were there.

498
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,487
-Seal the deal, dude.
-You had the opportunity.

499
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,489
-You gotta close... You gotta
close the deal. -Seal the deal.

500
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,158
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure the
girls didn't like each other.

501
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,660
-Doesn't matter.
-Doesn't matter.

502
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,036
HEIDI: Yeah, I really, honestly,
don't think it does.

503
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,329
You know what?

504
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,497
Seriously, as a guy, I think

505
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,498
you'd be amazed
how many girls, if that...

506
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,042
if you said
that's what you wanted to do,

507
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,335
how quickly it would happen.

508
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,461
-Wouldn't it, Jenna?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

509
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,671
-Don't you think so? -Yeah.
-Being a woman,

510
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,006
-I think it would. -JENNA:
I like two girls and a guy...

511
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,341
HEIDI:
Two girls and a guy.

512
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,259
JENNA:
I'd propose it to the guy.

513
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,718
HEIDI: Never, never
two guys and a girl.

514
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,303
JENNA: Or maybe just
girls together, but...

515
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,346
ROB:<i> The way Jenna and Heidi</i>
<i>were talking about threesomes,</i>

516
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,974
I'm re-thinking
my whole strategy,

517
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,434
so that the final three might
be myself, Heidi and Jenna.

518
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,855
<i>I could be having a threesome</i>
<i>on Day 37 out here,</i>

519
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,357
<i>and this would just be the most</i>

520
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,359
incredible adventure
of my life.

521
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,904
-(snores) -All right,
lights out, sports fans.

522
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,364
-JENNA: Good night, all.
-HEIDI: Good night.

523
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,407
-Good night...
-Good night, Jacaré.

524
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,783
Good night, Rob Boy.

525
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,330
(birds squawking)

526
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,427
(clanking)

527
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,659
ROB:
<i>I don't know</i>

528
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,412
<i>why Roger started</i>
<i>pushing everybody so hard.</i>

529
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,914
<i>The guy has no idea</i>

530
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,417
how much of a jerk he is.

531
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,918
<i>He has no sense</i>
<i>of self-awareness</i>

532
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:22,758
<i>that he can determine</i>
<i>that people don't like him.</i>

533
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,967
Nobody likes him.

534
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,678
So how many people are gonna
vote against Roger-- seven?

535
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,389
Seven against three?

536
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,600
Oh, if Rog is gone,
I'll be so happy.

537
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,645
And I'm just gonna keep-keep
kissing his ass the whole time,

538
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,731
so he doesn't suspect a thing.

539
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,399
Are we still gonna
be able to get-get Dave?

540
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,567
Dave's second, you bet.

541
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,652
Dave-Dave is so charismatic
that it just scares...

542
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,112
scares me to death.

543
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,907
DEENA: Because the girls are
pissed off that they think

544
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,283
that we are so stupid

545
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,993
that we haven't been planning
since day one.

546
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,787
-ROB: Okay.
-(Deena scoffs) Ugh!

547
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,457
DEENA:
<i>Rob chose me, and I...</i>

548
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,460
I can honestly say
that it's Rob and I

549
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,586
that have engineered
this whole turnaround.

550
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,464
And it is not the battle
of the sexes anymore,

551
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,301
but it's the battle of
the weaker versus the stronger.

552
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,844
And they're so stinking cocky.

553
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,679
I hate that.

554
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,681
Never underestimate
the power of a woman.

555
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,976
-Yeah.
-Ever.

556
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,812
Silly boys.

557
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,313
Games are for girls.

558
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,108
ROB: As long as one boy gets
to come along in this game.

559
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,651
Top three, baby, right here.

560
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,612
Boom.

561
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,488
You, me and Jenna.

562
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,324
ROB:
Okay.

563
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,659
And then, of course,
it's every girl for himself.

564
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,161
(Rob laughs)

565
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,498
Oh, yeah!

566
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,667
Dave's your daddy.

567
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,253
Oh, look there--
he's got another one.

568
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,505
-(Jenna mutters)
-DEENA: Oh, look at that.

569
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,673
Deena, we have a chance
of being really, really close.

570
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,218
I know. I want to go
all the way to the final three.

571
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,178
We have to work it out
to our benefit,

572
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,847
'cause you have
to understand Alex has a...

573
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,806
an alliance with Rob.

574
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,641
I would rather take him out
of the picture,

575
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,726
and force Rob to come with us.

576
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,854
-Do you understand
what I'm saying? -Yes.

577
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,563
How's it doing?

578
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,190
-Eleven.
-DEENA: Oh.

579
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,525
Outstanding. What kind?

580
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,026
MATT:
Catfish,

581
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,196
some sort of herring,
and a piranha.

582
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,198
-So everybody gets a fish?
-Yup. -Yup.

583
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,200
MATT:
And then some.

584
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,202
I may never win
individual immunity.

585
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,120
I may not, either.

586
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,539
-But it doesn't matter.
-Doesn't matter.

587
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,249
Doesn't matter.

588
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,834
DEENA:
<i>Roger, Butch and Dave think</i>

589
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,379
<i>that they have</i>
<i>this game sewn up.</i>

590
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,382
Sorry. There was an Adam,
and then there was an Eve.

591
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,051
And do you remember, Eve just
kind of took Adam right along

592
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,219
with the rest of the boat.

593
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,095
Oh!

594
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,514
DEENA:
<i>And that's what we're gonna do.</i>

595
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,849
<i>We're gonna play 'em,</i>
<i>we're gonna play 'em hard,</i>

596
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,684
<i>because we're gonna beat them</i>
<i>at their own game.</i>

597
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,144
<i>You can't be cocky</i>
<i>and just assume</i>

598
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,353
<i>that girls are gonna lie down</i>

599
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,231
and let it all happen, and
"Gosh, thanks, that was so good.

600
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,192
You guys are such good players.
Congratulations."

601
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,735
No. Game is mine.

602
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,695
Roger is gone,

603
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,240
<i>then Dave and then the rest</i>
<i>will have to work itself out.</i>

604
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,825
<i>And they can sit there, and</i>

605
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,868
they can be cocky,
but I'm gonna tell you,

606
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,579
the boys are gonna be sweating
tomorrow night,

607
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,289
after Roger goes home.

608
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,714
(thunder rumbling)

609
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,758
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

610
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,760
Come on in, guys.

611
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,971
Head right for this rope ladder
right in here.

612
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,306
Grab hold of it, Butch.

613
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:16,806
Immunity idol--
pass it up front.

614
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,812
-Got it?
-Got it.

615
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:27,275
Tribal immunity no more.

616
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,735
This is now what you covet.

617
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,819
-(all exclaim) -Ooh!
-Oh, yeah.

618
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,280
PROBST:
Individual immunity necklace.

619
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,282
When you have this
around your neck,

620
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,784
you are safe from the vote.

621
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,869
All challenges
from here on out are individual.

622
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,830
Today's immunity challenge--
very simple,

623
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,624
and it requires one thing:
willpower.

624
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,918
How badly do you want it?

625
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,795
You're each gonna stand
on a perch

626
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,256
four inches wide
by 12 inches long.

627
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,840
It's not a very big piece
of wood.

628
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,634
If you jump off,
if you fall off,

629
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,762
if your hands touch any part
of the perch

630
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,806
or the structure at any time,
you're out.

631
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,809
Last person left standing
wins immunity.

632
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,643
We're gonna randomly
draw numbers

633
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,104
to pick your perch position,

634
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,356
and wait for my go.

635
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:12,821
The challenge starts
in four three, two, one...

636
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,448
Challenge begins.

637
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:19,494
And Roger gets his balance.

638
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,803
These old bones just aren't
what they used to be.

639
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,638
MATT: Yeah, my chicken legs
are struggling.

640
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,348
-Yup. -PROBST: Hey,
just remember, guys,

641
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,559
that if you fall off
or jump off,

642
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,519
you've been out here long enough

643
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,563
to know what's in the water,
so make a quick swim

644
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,481
over to this rope ladder
and join me.

645
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,863
Roger's struggling.

646
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,532
Yeah, I am.

647
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,123
MATT: If it wouldn't be so hot,
it'd be a little easier.

648
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,878
I don't... I don't think I'm
gonna stand up here much longer.

649
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,046
-Really?
-Yeah.

650
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,215
PROBST: That's confidence.
I'll have to give you that.

651
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,218
I'll lay it out right now
how this is gonna work.

652
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,929
There will be some temptations
along the way.

653
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,057
If you want to jump off and
miss out on it, go right ahead.

654
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,226
I'd take my clothes off for
chocolate and peanut butter.

655
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,854
ROB: Get the girl some chocolate
and peanut butter, Probst.

656
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:31,024
-If you add cola, I'm so in.
-Ah, dude, there you go.

657
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,902
PROBST:
Okay, Jenna, Heidi.

658
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,737
-Oh!
-Wow, he produces. -MATT: Damn.

659
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,201
Two ice-cold colas, one heaping
plate of rich peanut butter.

660
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,536
-Okay.
-PROBST: You guys can share.

661
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,705
Big tray of chocolate cookies.

662
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,790
-Heidi, you want to do it?
-HEIDI: Yeah. -All right.

663
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:51,211
Oh, God, why me?
Why did I...?

664
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,213
-I'm not looking.
-Nope.

665
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:53,922
-I got to stay focused. -HEIDI:
Where can I keep my clothes?

666
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,964
-I'm looking.
-I'm looking.

667
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,258
Heidi, just pull your pants down
to your ankles.

668
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,094
-Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about. -Oh, yeah.

669
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,929
-I'm not looking.
-One, two, three.

670
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,430
-Oh, my God.
-♪ Ta-da! ♪

671
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,766
All the kids at school,
I'm not looking.

672
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,600
PROBST:
Nobody's looking.

673
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,310
You guys aren't
even trying to tempt

674
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,311
these guys off with this.

675
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,729
-I am looking.
-I'm looking.

676
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,106
-Are you kidding me?
-Heidi, you want to jump in?

677
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,273
-HEIDI: Yup.
-All right, let's go.

678
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:12,982
HEIDI: Hold on.
I got to get my shorts.

679
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,984
Are they around your ankles?

680
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:15,860
Ah, she's in the drink.

681
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,240
-Good luck, guys.
-Let's go, girls.

682
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,408
Come on over, girls.

683
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,411
You lost your buff there, Heidi.

684
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,453
PROBST:
It's 30 minutes in.

685
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,622
It's going to take
a little while for another deal.

686
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,957
Big round of applause.

687
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,000
-PROBST: They earned their
reward, for sure. -Well done.

688
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,088
PROBST: Join her on the,
uh, bench over there

689
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,172
and dig in, guys.

690
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,303
Mmm, peanut butter!

691
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,179
Hey, Jenna, how is it?

692
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,348
-Oh, God. You guys have no idea.
-Nice.

693
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,600
-Nice.
-Hang in there.

694
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,144
All right, I've had it.

695
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,770
I'm going to make the plunge.

696
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,980
I'm done talking.

697
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,108
It obviously won't be
as spectacular as the two women.

698
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,985
You're at, uh,
35 minutes right now.

699
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,487
Yeah, I-I wanted to go
by 30 minutes.

700
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,488
That was fine.

701
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,699
Roger is giving up.

702
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,162
There he goes.

703
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,248
With little fanfare,
he's out of the game.

704
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,170
Didn't even want to wait
for a temptation.

705
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:19,048
Roger, good jump.

706
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,050
(thunder rumbling)

707
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,848
PROBST:
Here comes the rain.

708
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,726
Ah, it's starting.
It begins.

709
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,022
PROBST:
Well, in 15 seconds,

710
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,025
you will have been
out here one hour.

711
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,985
I promised you
something interesting.

712
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,529
We've got the rain making it
more tempting to get down.

713
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,947
-I'm ready to go now.
-I'm serious.

714
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,074
It's a piping hot pizza.

715
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,076
-I'm in.
-Whoa!

716
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,165
PROBST: Three takers.
They're sharing pizza.

717
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,250
Come on over, guys.

718
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,543
Get out of the rain.

719
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,711
Guys, hang tight.

720
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,714
It's getting awfully windy.

721
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:02,425
-Boo-yah.
-Oh, yeah!

722
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,844
PROBST:
Hang on, Matthew.

723
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,438
You guys have been out there
one and a half hours.

724
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,357
Hey, is this all you've got?

725
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,776
This is a challenge
right here, huh?

726
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,152
Is this all you've got?

727
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,541
PROBST: How long you think
you can last, Deena?

728
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,250
It's okay.
I outlasted Roger.

729
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,461
That's all that really matters.

730
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,465
PROBST:
Coming up on two hours.

731
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,926
What's in the box, dude?

732
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,553
-Yeah, what's in that box?
-PROBST: It's a plate

733
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,930
-full of very hot buffalo wings
and blue cheese. -I'm in.

734
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,558
I'm in, man. I'm hungry.

735
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,604
PROBST:
Dave and Matthew

736
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,232
splitting the buffalo wings
and blue cheese.

737
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,652
We are down to two:
Deena and Christy.

738
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,739
Hot, dude.

739
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,076
PROBST:
Two hours, 30 minutes.

740
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,953
-Deena, Christy.
-What?

741
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:16,833
One very big plate
of spaghetti and meatballs.

742
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,250
No garlic bread?

743
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,627
This is it.

744
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,796
No garlic bread.

745
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,631
PROBST:
Christy, Deena, hey.

746
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,384
60 seconds-- right now.

747
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,136
(no voice)

748
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,263
You want the necklace?

749
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,055
But I'll share.
It doesn't matter.

750
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,808
Okay.

751
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:34,559
We're sharing.

752
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,185
-PROBST: The food?
-The food.

753
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,272
Who's going to take the fall,
and who's going to win immunity?

754
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,149
But I want the necklace, too.
Okay, um...

755
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,528
Rock, paper, scissors?

756
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,286
Did I lose?

757
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,162
PROBST:
Rock breaks scissors.

758
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,289
(cheering)

759
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,624
All right, Deena!

760
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,250
Deena wins first
individual immunity.

761
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,712
Come get it.

762
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,841
I'm glad she won it.

763
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:07,842
All right, Deena!

764
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,844
That's the way!

765
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,015
Negotiated like only
an attorney could.

766
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,143
You come out with food
and the immunity.

767
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,187
Turn around.

768
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,855
Congratulations.

769
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,065
-All right, Deena!
-Yeah!

770
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,109
You are safe
from the vote tonight.

771
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,278
Take some time to eat your meal.

772
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,341
(growling)

773
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:10,029
I said that the only way Roger
is going to win immunity

774
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,866
is if it's a contest,
"Name That Perry Como Song,"

775
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,579
<i>or perhaps, uh,</i>
<i>"What Type of Prune is This?"</i>

776
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,250
<i>Or some sort of other thing</i>
<i>that only an old man</i>

777
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,294
like Roger would be able
to determine.

778
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,922
-I'd do it all over again.
-(chuckles)

779
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,090
ALEX:
<i>I'm actually excited.</i>

780
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,718
<i>The game worked out</i>
<i>better than expected.</i>

781
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,302
We had the best time out there.

782
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,929
Naked chicks? Yeah.

783
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,723
Pizza? Yeah.

784
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,558
Roger was stupid enough
to jump off

785
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,268
and get himself nothing?
Yeah.

786
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,769
(chuckling)

787
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,271
<i>He has no idea</i>
<i>that he's going home tonight.</i>

788
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,440
<i>Um...</i>

789
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,025
(laughing): It was
a beautiful day in the Amazon.

790
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,239
There you go. There it is.

791
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,783
We need more of that,
'cause it...

792
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,618
-this looks wet. -Right here.
Right here. Right here.

793
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,369
DEENA:<i> When we got back</i>
<i>from the immunity challenge</i>

794
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,247
<i>and the men took care of fire,</i>

795
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,791
took care of firewood-- because
that's what men do best--

796
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,293
and then we stood in front
of the fire to warm our bodies.

797
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,795
I'm not trying
to crowd you guys. Sorry.

798
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,464
DEENA:
<i>And poor Roger is planning</i>

799
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,465
<i>all of these</i>
<i>interesting activities</i>

800
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,925
<i>for later on this evening,</i>
<i>and...</i>

801
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,011
Roger's going home.

802
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,013
-I really don't have to pack.
-No.

803
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,931
Would people be offended
if I did not pack?

804
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,808
-No. You can't pack.
-You can't get kicked...

805
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,519
The women are gone,
and it... it's that simple.

806
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,813
<i>And it looks</i>
<i>as though it-it's...</i>

807
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,857
<i>everything is falling</i>
<i>into place,</i>

808
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,399
<i>exactly like we planned it.</i>

809
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,318
<i>Uh, you know,</i>

810
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,028
and I'm sitting here
saying it's...

811
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,821
it's too good to be true.

812
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,781
HEIDI:
I'm sitting there thinking,

813
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,324
"Where's the effing
peanut butter? I'm...

814
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,492
I'm going to grind
the peanuts myself."

815
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,162
I was like, "Jeff, get
these girls some peanut butter!"

816
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,622
(laughter)

817
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,956
We are definitely the original

818
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,999
<i>-Survivor</i> Girls Gone Wild.
-HEIDI: Yeah.

819
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,459
-Yeah, definitely.
-There's no doubt about it.

820
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,335
HEIDI:
We are the Amazon chicks.

821
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,336
-So, really...
-Gee, and-and the...

822
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,671
oh, what makes it
even more funny,

823
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,381
is the guys think that
they're slowly picking us off.

824
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,508
-Yes. Yes.
-Which is so...

825
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,509
And they're being

826
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,635
<i>so nice to me and Heidi.</i>

827
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,719
<i>They're like, "You know what?</i>

828
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,804
<i>You're going to go eventually."</i>

829
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,347
<i>-And we're like, "Aw..."</i>
-HEIDI:<i> Yeah.</i>

830
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,348
HEIDI:
<i>"We'll try to spare you.</i>

831
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,058
<i>We'll try to spare you guys."</i>

832
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,685
JENNA:<i> Yeah, and we're, like,</i>
<i>"You guys are so sweet."</i>

833
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,937
Especially with... with Roger.

834
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,896
-Oh... oh.
-I mean, he could've... he...

835
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,356
he thinks that he's
just got it in the bag.

836
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,358
(thunder rumbling)

837
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,032
Nothing we can do about it now.

838
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:21,494
DAVE:<i> I think that all four</i>
<i>of the females</i>

839
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:26,499
<i>realize that they are going</i>
<i>to be quickly eliminated,</i>

840
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,417
<i>because the six males</i>
<i>are starting</i>

841
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,503
<i>to stick together</i>
<i>a little bit better.</i>

842
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:34,215
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that they're surprised that...</i>

843
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,551
four girls and six guys--

844
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,303
they're looking to go packing
pretty quick.

845
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,347
We're on, guys.

846
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,599
And that pot
has been boiled, huh?

847
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,393
ROB:<i> I realized early on</i>
<i>that the other men</i>

848
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:50,523
<i>that I was dealt with</i>
<i>are a bunch of jamokes.</i>

849
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,358
<i>They have no idea</i>
<i>that the women are capable</i>

850
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,402
<i>of taking them all out</i>
<i>at this point in the game.</i>

851
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,863
<i>I will go as far as to say</i>

852
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,072
<i>that I know</i>
<i>that I'm going to be</i>

853
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,241
<i>the last man standing</i>
<i>in this game.</i>

854
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,742
<i>And I don't think</i>

855
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,286
any of the other men

856
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,788
have any idea
what's going on around them.

857
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,350
Okay.

858
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,644
Last time I saw you guys,

859
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,271
before the challenge,
you were heading out

860
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,898
in a new boat as one tribe.

861
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,443
Butch, what was the new tribe's
first order of business?

862
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,444
Well, what we wanted
to do first was, of course,

863
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,571
establish a...
a place of residency.

864
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,948
And, uh, we felt it
was important... at least I felt

865
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,700
it was important
to include everybody

866
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,618
and everybody's opinion.

867
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,078
So I say we all came together
as a team.

868
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,288
Is that accurate, Rob?

869
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,122
Was it pretty inclusive?

870
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,958
Everybody had a...
a part to play.

871
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,294
If you didn't know what you
were particularly good at,

872
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,296
there was a couple people
that were more than happy

873
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,256
to tell you
where you should be going

874
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,299
and what you should be doing.

875
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,426
And, uh, we did get the shelter
up pretty quickly,

876
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,802
so I guess it worked.

877
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,471
PROBST: Okay, I'll read
between the lines.

878
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,431
There were a couple of people
more than willing

879
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,432
to tell you what to do.

880
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,268
Are you saying
there were bossy people quickly,

881
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,311
or are you saying
you like being subservient

882
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,480
to people who decide what to do?

883
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,773
I like being subservient

884
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,942
to the people that decide
what to do.

885
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,778
PROBST: Deena, did any women
viably participate

886
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,820
in building the shelter?

887
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,821
Putting the logs together

888
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,158
with the four corners
of the foundation? No.

889
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,827
But you know what?
We so had the opportunity

890
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,995
to re-bond with one another,

891
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,997
and I think that
is so far more important

892
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,124
than putting together the
four corners of the structure.

893
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,000
PROBST:
Roger, you've got

894
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,878
a real smug look
on your face right now.

895
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,381
You can have too many Indians,
in this case,

896
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,507
creating a structure.

897
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,509
I mean, if there were more
than four of us

898
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,344
putting together the foundation,
it wouldn't have worked,

899
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,347
but, uh, it-it was going
to be done that way, regardless.

900
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,517
I mean, it was important
for the new tribe to establish

901
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,855
a very, uh, strong and stable
shelter as quickly as we could.

902
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,858
Jenna, let's talk
about the challenge today.

903
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,902
Okay.

904
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,487
Well, certainly, you and Heidi

905
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,906
provided a highlight
at the challenge.

906
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,534
Aside from the fact that you
got naked for peanut butter,

907
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,494
you guys jumped off that perch,

908
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,413
first two,
and it wasn't very long in.

909
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,706
We're playing for immunity.

910
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,916
Where does the confidence
come from to say,

911
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,209
"I'm really not worried?"

912
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,211
If one of us
gets kicked off tonight

913
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,547
because we jumped off
for peanut butter and cookies,

914
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,883
-it was still worth it
'cause it was fun, -Yeah. Yeah.

915
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,885
-and it was really, really good.
-I totally agree.

916
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,554
Now, Roger,
you weren't long after.

917
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,349
Yeah. Yeah, and I rationalized
the whole thing.

918
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,977
"Hey, I'm not going to win
immunity on this,

919
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,312
so I might as well
just jump in."

920
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,939
Would it have been different
for you,

921
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,066
knowing that you didn't feel
you could win,

922
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,900
but you knew you needed it?

923
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,194
Would you have hung
in there longer?

924
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:46,198
Obviously, if I really felt
that I needed that immunity,

925
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,409
I would've given it my all.
Yes.

926
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,913
Deena, you are the only one
who cannot be voted for tonight,

927
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,916
but because you have
that immunity around your neck,

928
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,625
if you thought
there was somebody

929
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,753
that needed protecting tonight,

930
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,588
you can assign that immunity
to somebody else.

931
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,090
I choose not to.

932
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,468
I choose to assign it to myself.

933
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,927
PROBST:
It is time to vote.

934
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,471
Jenna, you're first.

935
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,197
Christy, I wish today
you had hung in there.

936
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,448
<i>You would've stayed there,</i>

937
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,117
<i>and you definitely would not</i>
<i>have received my vote.</i>

938
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,287
You've contributed greatly
to the tribe.

939
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,132
Reality check and mate.

940
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,510
Never underestimate
the power of a woman.

941
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,489
I'll go tally the votes.

942
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,332
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

943
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:19,542
Person voted out will be asked

944
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,918
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

945
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,046
I'll read the votes.

946
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,965
First vote.

947
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,592
Christy.

948
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,681
Christy.
Two votes Christy.

949
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,687
Roger.

950
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,772
One vote Roger,
two votes Christy.

951
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,487
That's two votes Roger,
two votes Christy.

952
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,534
Three votes Christy.

953
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,703
We're tied--
three votes Roger,

954
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,621
three votes Christy.

955
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,709
That's four votes Roger,

956
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,585
three votes Christy.

957
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,217
That's five votes Roger.

958
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:17,892
Seventh person voted out
of the tribe:

959
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,518
Roger.

960
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,270
Need to bring me your torch.

961
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,907
Roger, the tribe has spoken.

962
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,410
It's time for you to go.

963
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,381
PROBST: Well, from this point
forward, the game changes,

964
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,758
because you are the final nine.

965
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,385
Seven of you will make it
to the jury.

966
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,595
One of you will be
the sole survivor.

967
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,930
Grab your torches.

968
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,348
Head back to camp.
Good night.

969
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,988
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

970
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,910
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor:

971
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:18,869
<i>Matt loses touch with reality.</i>

972
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,456
Once again,
he is sharpening his machete.

973
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:23,666
I know.

974
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,459
ALEX:<i> Matt's kind of</i>
<i>losing it out here,</i>

975
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:29,129
and nobody's all that
comfortable around him.

976
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,131
PROBST:<i> And Heidi and Dave</i>
<i>get in touch with each other.</i>

977
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,551
ROB:<i> I don't like the fact</i>
<i>that somebody in my alliance</i>

978
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,928
<i>is sleeping with the enemy.</i>

979
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,894
I am a very strong individual,
and I am a leader,

980
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,313
and I can't hold that back.

981
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,609
I said from the beginning,
"I'm my worst enemy in this game

982
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,112
because I am very
strong-willed."

983
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,656
I'll never see these people
again in my life,

984
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,825
and I don't think I got
outwitted or outplayed.

985
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,953
Definitely got outlasted.
