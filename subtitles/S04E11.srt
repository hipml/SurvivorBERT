1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,252
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:07,257
Survivor, the Soliantu camp
embraced a new spirit.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,428
>> This is a new day we're
starting here!

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,556
>> The people that play this
game fairly have a good chance

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,100
to get to the top.
>> PROBST: The remaining members

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,270
of John's shattered alliance
fought with each other to stay

7
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,229
in the game.
>> From the get go, I didn't

8
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,982
like you.
>> PROBST: Sean and Paschal won

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,275
a Marquesan feast in the reward
challenge.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:29,279
>> Felt like Julius Caesar, man.
>> PROBST: And they smuggled

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,156
some food back to share with the
rest of the tribe.

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,325
>> Thank you so much for
bringing food back.

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,162
That is so nice of you.
>> PROBST: Tammy won a crucial

14
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,455
immunity challenge.
>> Whoo! Yes, yes, yes!

15
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,417
>> PROBST: And Soliantu went to
Tribal Council, where Zoe was

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,252
voted out of the tribe.
Zoe, the tribe has spoken.

17
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:50,300
Seven are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:05,273
(<i> theme song playing</i> )

19
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:44,771
(<i> theme song playing</i> )

20
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,622
>> Day 28.

21
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,541
>> Ain't got long, sweetheart.
>> I know.

22
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:09,087
11 days.
11 days to go, that's it.

23
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,341
>> It was cold last night.
>> It was freezing last night.

24
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,886
>> Good morning.
How you doing, Sean?

25
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,222
>> Can't sleep.
>> Can't sleep.

26
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,724
My mattress.
>> It's got some lumps.

27
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,017
It's lumpy.
Lumpy.

28
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,396
>> We're all one big family,
man, we spoon, we snuggle, but

29
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,442
it's strictly for keeping warm.
I mean the whole love tribe

30
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,864
aspect of this game has been a
fallacy to a certain point.

31
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,450
Let's call ourselves the love
tribe when this game is over,

32
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,704
like will you really call me?
Will I really call you?

33
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:50,420
I think there are certain people
who genuinely are affectionate

34
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,464
and feel family vibes.
But in the context of a game

35
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:58,761
where people are trying to
position themselves, can a love

36
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:04,976
tribe truly exist?
>> Don't you know it's your

37
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,102
birthday?
You're not supposed to be

38
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,813
working on your birthday.
>> Well, it is my birthday.

39
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,815
>> Is it true?
>> Yes, it is.

40
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,567
>> Oh, my God, are you 20?
Or 21.

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,447
>> Happy birthday, girlfriend.
Birthday girl!

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,449
>> Got to blow it out.
>> In celebration of V's

43
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,244
birthday, we cut open the last
two bananas and mango.

44
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,413
Made her a little candle and
sang to her this morning, 'cause

45
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,416
we knew that was going to be the
best meal of the day, so...

46
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,128
>> Thank you, guys, so much.
>> Happy birthday.

47
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,924
>> If I wasn't at home, you guys
are the next best thing to be

48
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,135
with.
>> That's very sweet.

49
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:42,639
>> V's birthday was pretty
subdued, but as much as I could,

50
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,559
I kept trying to make her feel a
little bit special, being that,

51
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,396
you know, she's not with her
husband and her family.

52
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,320
>> I feel like we're all like
used spark plugs, because I'm

53
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,949
telling you it's a very, very
difficult time for me food wise

54
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,034
and just from the energy
perspective.

55
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,412
>> We don't really have much
choice in our dinner, lunch and

56
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,666
breakfast menu is pretty much
troko, taro and definitely

57
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,834
coconut.
>> You know, we tried in the

58
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,004
beginning, everybody's been
out there, trying to catch

59
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,339
something.
And even though we talk about

60
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:21,010
it, I think our energy wanes as
the day goes on, and the odds of

61
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,348
us actually catching a fish are
unfortunately diminishing.

62
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:35,066
>> There are black tip baby
sharks right here, in our front

63
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,861
yard.
And I'm determined.

64
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,699
They swim right under my feet.
I'm going to see if I can whack

65
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,409
it because they come so close.
You can see their little black

66
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,705
fins popping out of the water.
They're right here.

67
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,333
But there's too much wave action
here to see them.

68
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:57,588
They're taunting us, it's crazy.
It would be great food.

69
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,012
>> You know what?
From today's reward challenge, I

70
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:08,057
would give anything if the
reward was food.

71
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,144
>> I never thought I could feel
the inside of my ribs, but I do.

72
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,605
>> Oh, I'd give anything if it
was Oreo cookies and have, like,

73
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,067
Twix or Snickers ice cream to
put on top of the Oreo cookie,

74
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,737
and just inhale.
>> All the food that we've been

75
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,780
dreaming about.
>> Snickers, s'mores.

76
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,366
>> Oh, big fudge brownie.
>> Big fudge brownie.

77
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,578
>> A hot skillet with caramel.
>> Oh, God!

78
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:43,134
Oh, that sounds so good!
>> I think the sugar food

79
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,428
fantasy is making things worse
for everybody.

80
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,598
They just sort of get people
lethargic on a raft, thinking

81
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,060
about it and talking about it
instead of getting up and taking

82
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,479
some action to find new food.
It's fun, but at the same time I

83
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,608
do think the diversion is wrong.
I don't think it's healthy.

84
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,236
So I'm going to try to do some
different things for food, and

85
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,197
also mentally it's just a
diversion.

86
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,534
It feels better than sitting
around talking about sweets.

87
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,290
>> V, I'm holding on to a
thread, baby.

88
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,085
threat.
What are you talking about?

89
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,339
>> Just my energy, I can't put
it into words.

90
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,466
I'm just trying to hold on.
>> We're just trying to conserve

91
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,095
energy.
It is a pull to get through the

92
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,348
day now.
This is without a doubt the

93
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,643
worst place I have ever been on
Earth.

94
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:39,107
And it's just a constant battle
of dirt, filth, heat, sand,

95
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,610
wind, insects.
Everything about it is nasty,

96
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:48,616
dirty, filthy-- it's just pure
hell.

97
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,287
>> See if my check came in.
>> Let's see.

98
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,874
A place mat.
>> "You're about to hit rock

99
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:02,004
bottom."
>> All right, let's show this to

100
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,299
everybody else.
>> Was there anything else in

101
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,634
there?
>> Let me see.

102
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,512
Yep.
Here.

103
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,516
Birthday wish, baby.
Come on, give me a birthday hug.

104
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,935
>> Oh, my brother.
Thank you so much.

105
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,729
>> I know how much this means to
be away from home and our family

106
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,692
on this day.
I just want to tell you happy

107
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,528
birthday, sister, I love you,
okay?

108
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,698
>> No one likes to be away from
home on their birthday, of

109
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,368
course not.
But at that point that was kind

110
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,538
of tough.
Because I really hadn't thought

111
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,709
too much about being away from
Leander on my birthday.

112
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:47,175
So it was a little special and a
little sad as well.

113
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,887
I miss him so much.
I can't wait to see him.

114
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,223
>> I know.
>> But we are here and we are

115
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,893
going to do this.
God is with us, each and every

116
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,730
day.
>> We've been blessed beyond our

117
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,732
means, okay.
We can head back and give it

118
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,691
100%.
We'll have a nice meal there.

119
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,277
>> That's right. We gotta
remember that.

120
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:14,702
>> Exactly.
>> You guys, we got some good

121
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,247
tree mail!
>> Very good.

122
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,083
>> Somebody may be getting a
nice hot shower.

123
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,085
>> Ready?
"Should we just give you

124
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,712
treasures, I wouldn't hold your
breath.

125
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:29,592
"You're about to hit rock bottom
if you're faster than the rest.

126
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,387
"The style of the rich and
famous, pampered like a king,

127
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,765
"hot showers, clean clothes,
great food.

128
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:40,561
That's what victory brings."
>> Oh, my gosh!

129
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,481
>> God, we have to dive again.
>> Yeah, we got to go down.

130
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,776
>> Down, and it's going to be
tough going underwater.

131
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,779
(indistinct chatter)
>> I can swim to save my life if

132
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:54,116
you give me a short distance,
but I don't really feel too

133
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,327
comfortable in a whole lot of
water.

134
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,289
>> The worst thing you can do is
be overanxious, like overzealous

135
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,792
or anxious.
You just got to be real calm.

136
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,127
>> Either way it's going to be
tough.

137
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,129
>> Oh, God, it's going to be
hard.

138
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,590
>> Well, hey, I'd like to win a
reward.

139
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,134
I'd like to win something.
I need something.

140
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,805
>> Look around, man, all of us
are on our last leg.

141
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:34,490
>> PROBST: Good morning, guys.
Today's reward challenge is an

142
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,284
island version of musical
chairs.

143
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,619
First round starts with all
seven of you.

144
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,831
Scattered along the bottom of
the ocean floor are six shells.

145
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,001
They're marked by yellow rocks
to make them more visible.

146
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,378
The seven of you are going to
dive down.

147
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,339
Who ever comes up without a
shell is eliminated.

148
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,302
Next round, six people dive down
for only five shells; we'll do

149
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,846
this until we have four tribe
members left.

150
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,849
Those four will compete then
in a final sprint from the dock

151
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,893
to the shore carrying a 40-pound
rock underwater.

152
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,856
First one to drop the rock at my
feet wins the reward.

153
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:13,821
This is what you're playing for.
(laughter)

154
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,866
My personal Visa.
Which I will loan you for one

155
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,493
night.
You'll take this Visa and you'll

156
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,246
book yourself a room on a luxury
cruise ship.

157
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,373
That cruise ship right out
there.

158
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,209
(horn blowing)
So you go on board, check in,

159
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,880
make your way to your room.
I imagine you'll want to take a

160
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,884
nice, long, hot shower with all
the amenities, and a fresh set

161
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,761
of clothes.
New clothes for the first time

162
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,931
in 28 days.
You'll then make your way to one

163
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,893
of the observation decks where
you will enjoy a full course

164
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,144
meal.
All right.

165
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,898
Take a spot, wait for my go.
There are six shells, first six

166
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,110
of you back with these shells
move onto the next round.

167
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,112
Survivors ready!
>> Yeah.

168
00:10:55,196 --> 00:11:05,289
>> PROBST: Go!
>> PROBST: General and Paschal

169
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:16,759
>> PROBST: Go!
>> PROBST: General and Paschal

170
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,636
got a shell.
Tammy's got one.

171
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,930
Kathy's got a shell.
There are still shells down

172
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,933
there guys, don't quit.
V, are you giving up?

173
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,062
>> I'm giving up.
>> PROBST: Okay. Sean, there's

174
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:33,484
the opportunity, baby.
Let go of that buoy, swim over,

175
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:39,156
find a shell and get it.
>> I know, I just have to catch

176
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,451
my breath.
I'm going to go there.

177
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,912
>> PROBST: Look at that.
Neleh's got a shell.

178
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:51,419
Find that little bit of extra
strength and grab it.

179
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:01,303
Sean may have one.
Look at that!

180
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:05,474
Sean got a shell!
Yes!

181
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:10,229
(cheering)
Nice job.

182
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,981
>> Way to go. Whoo!
>> PROBST: Now you just got to

183
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,067
do it again.
Moving on to the next round.

184
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,861
V, you can head back to the
beach.

185
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,987
This round we're looking for
five.

186
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,990
There are five shells.
Survivors ready!

187
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:31,041
Go!
General and Paschal got a shell.

188
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:45,681
Go!
General and Paschal got a shell.

189
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,976
Tammy's got one.
Kathy's got a shell.

190
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,520
Neleh's got a shell.
There it is.

191
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,564
We got all five.
Nice work.

192
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,234
Kathy, General, Neleh, Tammy,
Paschal, moving on.

193
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,197
Sean, when you get your breath,
you're swimming in.

194
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,491
Nice effort.
Here we go, guys.

195
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,036
First four back with shells move
on to the final round.

196
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,415
Survivors ready!
Go!

197
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:28,557
Get down there Neleh, go!
Kathy's got one.

198
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,060
Tammy's got one.
Paschal's got one.

199
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,854
General's got it.
That's it, Neleh.

200
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,525
Catch your breath.
Neleh is going to swim on back.

201
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,027
You four stay here.
Wait for my go.

202
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,406
First one to bring a yellow
stone back to me wins.

203
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,202
Survivors ready!
Go!

204
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,635
>> Come on, Pappy!
Bring it home!

205
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,804
>> Yeah, Pappy!
>> Come on, Pap!

206
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,139
>> PROBST: Paschal is pulling
away.

207
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,643
(cheering)
>> Come on, baby!

208
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,187
>> Come on, baby, come on now!
>> Come on, Pappy!

209
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,649
>> Bring it home!
>> Don't look back.

210
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,109
Don't look back.
You're doing great.

211
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,320
Come on, man.
>> Come on, Paps.

212
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:14,371
(all cheering Paschal on)
>> PROBST: Nice job.

213
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:20,461
(all cheering Paschal on)
>> PROBST: Nice job.

214
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,629
Well earned.
>> Thank you, Jeff.

215
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,589
>> PROBST: Here's the deal.
I'll hold on to the Visa card,

216
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,674
we're going to bring the cruise
ship to you.

217
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,550
We'll get you a shower and some
food.

218
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,137
Guys, good effort, everybody out
there.

219
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,194
>> Wow, Pappy, your own cruise
ship.

220
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,657
There it is!
Oh, Pap, way to go, baby.

221
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,867
>> Very cool.
>> All of a sudden there's this

222
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,119
cruise ship, and the closer the
ship got, the more excited I

223
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,538
got.
And I was ready to swim out to

224
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,374
it.
It's a beautiful sight.

225
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:05,923
All for me.
>> Don't cheat yourself on the

226
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,218
desserts, Pas, you know that.
>> You know what's really good,

227
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,261
bananas foster, because we're on
French Polynesia.

228
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,181
>> That's the thing to get?
>> That's a French dessert.

229
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:18,102
>> Just open up the menu and say
okay, bring it all on.

230
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:24,233
>> Paschal! Come on aboard.
>> Bye, guys!

231
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,192
>> Bye!
>> Bye, Pappy.

232
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:31,573
He's going to be in a warm
shower in no time.

233
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,700
>> PROBST: Okay, I got to tell
you.

234
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,911
I hate for you to have this
great experience all alone.

235
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,706
>> Okay,
>> PROBST: So, is there one

236
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,916
tribe member you want to bring?
>> You got to be kidding me.

237
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,292
>> PROBST: No.
>> Neleh!

238
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,255
(Neleh screams)
>> Oh, wow.

239
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,257
>> Have fun, Neleh!
>> There was no conscious

240
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,093
decision; it was automatic
spontaneous reaction.

241
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,264
She's just the epitome of a
young lady that deserves it.

242
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,976
It was a wonderful opportunity
to enjoy something together.

243
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,272
(Neleh shrieks)
>> You deserved it.

244
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:07,901
>> Did she deserve as much as
anybody else? I mean, to me, it

245
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,946
was V's birthday that day.
She was feeling a little down,

246
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:15,159
and I don't know, had I won I
would definitely have picked V.

247
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,661
(Neleh screaming)
>> Bye!

248
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,873
>> Oh, my God!
Oh, that is so sweet.

249
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,509
>> If I go home tomorrow, I will
be like the happiest woman in

250
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,512
the whole wide world.
We were just beside ourselves

251
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,348
with excitement.
I've never been on a cruise ship

252
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,310
before, and I had never thought
that it would be that beautiful.

253
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,771
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.

254
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:48,150
Oh, it smells so good, Paschal.
Here, Pappy and I, we're

255
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,320
these grubby little rugrats
coming on to this really, really

256
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,322
nice cruise ship.
It was just awesome.

257
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,283
>> PROBST: Here's the deal, my
Visa card.

258
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,160
Michelle's going to check you
in.

259
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,037
Enjoy your night.
>> We appreciate it.

260
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,663
>> PROBST: Okay.
>> Thank you.

261
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,832
>> PROBST: Bye, guys.
>> Bye, bye, Jeff.

262
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,667
Thanks.
Hello, how you doing?

263
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,377
>> Good.
>> This is really something.

264
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,630
This is beautiful.
>> This is your room key.

265
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,174
Welcome aboard.
>> Thank you so much.

266
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,010
We're going to take you to your
room.

267
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,678
>> Oh, wow!
>> Oh, look at this.

268
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,973
>> Oh, my heavens.
Paschal, there's candy right

269
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,225
away!
Our clothes-- we haven't had

270
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,352
forever!
>> Look at the view!

271
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,356
Oh, How cool is this! I mean
look at this!

272
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,360
This is our own boat.
The ship was just absolutely

273
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,863
beautiful.
I can imagine how the royalties

274
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,866
of people on Earth must live,
because that's what we were

275
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,369
presented with.
>> Oh, my gosh, Paschal, look at

276
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,497
yourself in the mirror.
>> Oh, no!

277
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,334
>> It was just so weird to see
myself for the first time.

278
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,839
My hair looked like it was dark
brown, just greasy dread locks.

279
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,217
It was just gross.
It just felt so refreshing to

280
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,220
have hot water just pouring down
your body.

281
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,224
I mean, this was like luxury.
I put my hair up in this nice

282
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,227
fluffy white towel, put lotion
all over.

283
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,062
>> Whoo! Gosh!
That was wonderful!

284
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,898
I haven't felt this good in over
a month.

285
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,400
>> I felt like a whole new
person.

286
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:17,281
I didn't even feel like I was in
the game anymore, to tell you

287
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,242
the truth.
This is a dream come true,

288
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,411
Paschal.
We are so lucky to be here.

289
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:27,457
I'm so lucky to be here with
you.

290
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,046
>> Oh, look at this.
>> Oh, my heck!

291
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,049
Oh, cool.
We went around the corner and

292
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,929
there's this one table set up,
with the white linen cloth, like

293
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,267
ten pieces of silverware.
>> Cheers, darling, my little

294
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,310
daughter.
>> Cheers, Pappy.

295
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:50,272
>> Oh, look what's coming.
>> Don't even.

296
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,108
Oh, my gosh, it's bread!
>> Thanks.

297
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,610
Oh, wow.
Oh, my heck.

298
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,323
>> The best bread I've ever had.
>> The best butter I've ever

299
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:11,418
had.
>> To see them go off onto that

300
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,463
boat and we came back here to
prepare our muscley troko

301
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,465
shells.
That was a tough one.

302
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,802
None of us was happy.
>> Neleh is probably ordering

303
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,638
desert first.
And then again desserts.

304
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,265
>> Neleh's hair is probably
nicely conditioned and

305
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,018
shampooed, and it's probably
just flowing so nicely right

306
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,603
now.
>> I bet you she got it blow

307
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,480
dried.
>> Just beautiful, and having a

308
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,815
really good time.
>> You guys think they'll be

309
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,320
able to smuggle any food back?
>> Yeah.

310
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:47,162
>> So the next thing that came
out was, oh, what's it called,

311
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:53,001
what's the delicacy?
>>Escargot, that's for you, sir.

312
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,839
>> Thank you so much.
I don't think I've ever

313
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,549
had escargot.
I knew what escargot was, but I

314
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:04,304
couldn't envision that snail
would taste good.

315
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,514
>> Wow.
>> Oh.

316
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:10,018
>> Yum!
>> Oh, my heck.

317
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:15,357
Cream potatoes, vegetables.
>> Oh, my heck.

318
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,818
>> Would you care to have some
wine?

319
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,029
>> I wouldn't care for any.
>> I wouldn't either.

320
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,699
>> Thank you.
>> I just hope they don't get

321
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,243
upset and vote me out because of
this.

322
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,912
>> Paschal!
>> Dessert was the final course

323
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,666
and it was creme brulee which
I've never eaten in my life.

324
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,043
>> Ooh, what is that?
>> It is so sugary.

325
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,547
Man, that was good.
I was really looking forward to

326
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:44,720
the bill because I had no idea
what something like this would

327
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,223
cost, I figured maybe $150.
>> Holy cow!

328
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,184
Oh, my heck!
>> The bill was $312.

329
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,897
Which of course I didn't flinch
because it was not my money.

330
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,360
It could have been $3,000 and it
wouldn't have mattered to me.

331
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,319
Tip.
That's $200.

332
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,740
>> Thank you, sir.
>> Worth every penny of it.

333
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,616
Thank you very much.
>> Thank you, sir.

334
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,870
Have a nice evening.
>> Thank you.

335
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,497
>> $200 tip.
>> Paschal, I can't laugh

336
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,751
anymore.
I'm going to puke.

337
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,218
>> They're going to have beer
breath.

338
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,763
>> Neleh doesn't drink and
neither does Paschal.

339
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,891
They got the wrong people on
board to do some drinking.

340
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,894
>> Boy, that's for sure.
>> I would have been throwing

341
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,104
them back.
>> We were all sitting on the

342
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,981
raft waiting for them to come
back.

343
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,193
Everybody sitting there
wondering, do you think they're

344
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,279
going to bring food back?
Do you think they're going to

345
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,197
bring food?
>> Hi!

346
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,615
>> Hi. Did you have a great
time?

347
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,784
>> Oh, wow.
>> Look at your blow-dried hair.

348
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,577
>> We had the best time.
>> Don't get near me, I smell.

349
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,579
>> Hi, guys!
>> Oh, I'm going to puke if I

350
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,956
get too close.
>> Hi, guys.

351
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,583
>> Look how cleaned up you guys
are.

352
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:01,755
>> The first thing I did was I
stuck my face in Neleh's hair,

353
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:08,428
and her hair just smelled
fantastic.

354
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,848
>> There's a bathroom off to the
right and they had, you know,

355
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,309
the shampoo and the like a
loofah sponge.

356
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,312
I had to take the loofah sponge
and literally scrub.

357
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,690
It's almost like when you peel
stuff off your body, it's like

358
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,985
that black flaky stuff.
>> She was going on a little too

359
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,654
much about her shower and how
clean she was.

360
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,366
She's so damn sweet.
>> Anyway, and so the first

361
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,327
thing they brought out was a big
basket of bread.

362
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,580
And then after that...
>> The food sounded really good.

363
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,292
It kind of sucked listening to
them describe it in detail.

364
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,629
>> I wish so bad I could have
brought something back, you

365
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,006
guys.
I feel horrible telling you guys

366
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,634
about this.
Did you guys feel horrible

367
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,345
telling us?
>> No, but then we also brought

368
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,848
back some food.
>> The only thing I have left to

369
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,518
share is this mint that I shoved
in my mouth really fast.

370
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,062
So if everybody wants to take a
little nibble.

371
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,857
>> I'm okay, sweetheart.
>> Come on, you guys.

372
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,900
It's good, it's a little hard
mint; I don't want it.

373
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,362
>> You're offering seven
starving adults a piece of candy

374
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,865
out of your mouth.
Keep your mint candy, man.

375
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,535
You know, that's like saying
anybody want this piece of doo-

376
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,579
doo.
>> Nobody wants this?

377
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,687
>> Morning, guys.
>> Good morning.

378
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,732
>> Look how clean you are.
>> Oh, man.

379
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,734
I had the best night's sleep
ever.

380
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,696
>> The next morning when we wake
up, Neleh is still on the clean

381
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,073
kick, just kind of being the
princess.

382
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,411
And has her feet propped up in
her new clean clothes, looking

383
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,580
at her nails.
>> Can't believe my skin is

384
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,248
clean.
>> This is so weird.

385
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,001
>> Who cares if your nails are
clean or dirty?

386
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:06,588
I mean, there's chores to be
done and there's regular living

387
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:15,096
back on Soliantu.
She's one of those people who

388
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,641
cleverly will have the
perception that she's working,

389
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,768
but I don't really see her
carrying jugs.

390
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,896
I don't see her lifting wood, I
don't really see her doing the

391
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,107
work that she says she's doing.
But she's always the first one

392
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,902
to go, "I have so much energy."
I'm like I would too, if I

393
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:34,115
wasn't doing anything but taking
naps and walking and relaxing.

394
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,748
>> How is your porridge coming,
Kath?

395
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,834
>> Well, let me see the
ingredients.

396
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:50,632
>> I think it's going to taste
just like it did the other day.

397
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,094
>> Yuck.
>> Do you want porridge or do we

398
00:25:54,177 --> 00:26:02,477
want flank steak?
(Paschal chuckling)

399
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,815
>> I hear you, Pappy.
>> You do?

400
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,485
>> I think Neleh has definitely
snowed Paschal and everyone

401
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,779
else.
I think she's playing this game

402
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:17,158
harder than anybody left on this
island, and she's playing sweet

403
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,996
little girl next-door, and
before you know it, hey, I'm in

404
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,874
the finals and I'm so happy, and
oh, God, this is, oh heck.

405
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,335
>> And the bread, then you dip
it...

406
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,172
>> Hey, Neleh, you want to get
green leaves for our taro?

407
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:37,971
>> Absolutely.
Porridge hot, porridge cold.

408
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,974
>> I think Neleh has about 60 to
70% sweetness and about 30% or

409
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:46,021
40% she's working it.
I think it's a little much right

410
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,023
now, and she's working it too
hard.

411
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,735
She genuinely cares for everyone
here, but I think she's working

412
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,696
it with Paschal.
She's hovering under his wings

413
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,032
for protection.
>> Paschal, do you want any

414
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,701
taro?
>> No thank you, not right now.

415
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:07,834
>> Where is that creme brulee?
>> Hey, big man, come here and

416
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,754
sit in the shade.
>> I just had a little coconut,

417
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,881
and now I'm ready to do pig
snare.

418
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,050
Who wants to help?
>> A pig snare?

419
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,552
>> Sure.
He comes out here every night,

420
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,763
and he's about this tall.
I got a good look at him.

421
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:24,601
So I got a pig that comes down
into our camp every night.

422
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:29,064
I'm getting a little tired of
him taunting me, so I want to go

423
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,525
and catch that thing and make
some pork chops.

424
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,861
I figured this one, we bend it
over that way.

425
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:40,241
That way we won't really have to
bend it that far, but when he

426
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:44,245
lashes it, he'll be up.
>> Rob is building a pig snare.

427
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,708
I think because not only he's a
little bit frustrated that we

428
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:53,088
haven't got a pig, but I think
Rob wants to secure his place in

429
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:58,885
the tribe.
If he doesn't win, you know, the

430
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,721
next immunity challenge or the
following immunity challenge, at

431
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,642
least if he wins a pig, he can
hold that up and say, "Hey, I'm

432
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,771
a valuable member of this tribe.
Don't vote me out."

433
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,358
>> It might hold if this one was
farther down.

434
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,944
>> Whoa, it's all right.
I got it.

435
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:21,449
>> I catch a pig tonight, you
win immunity, and I'm going to

436
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,827
tell them, look, she's immune, I
caught the pig.

437
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,455
You can't get rid of me and not
let me have any of my pig, you

438
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:33,628
got to keep me, I got a pig.
And then he'll pull, look at

439
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:42,929
that release.
>> Guys, we got mail!

440
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,849
>> Guys, we got mail!
>> Mail, at this hour, weird.

441
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,852
>> Sounds like it's happening
tonight.

442
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:49,978
>> Happening tonight?
>> Big wow.

443
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,980
>> Big wow.
All right, guys, ready?

444
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,858
>> Yeah.
>> "Race against the others

445
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,026
until you're feeling hot.
"The most basic skill of

446
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,863
survival, show them what you've
got.

447
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:04,993
"Food, water and protection,
most important in this game.

448
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,288
"You may as well just pack your
bags if you fail to strike

449
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:12,167
flame."
>> Guess what we're doing

450
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,169
tonight.
We're going to have to make fire

451
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,837
tonight.
>> We've got to make fire.

452
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,048
>> That's what it sounds like.
>> Yeah, we've got to make fire.

453
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,884
Yet another curve ball.
I've been busting my butt all

454
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,637
day, you know, chopping wood,
making a new pig snare and

455
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,015
everything like that.
These other people have been

456
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,642
sleeping all day and resting.
I wish I knew that.

457
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,436
You know, I thought it was a day
off.

458
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,065
It's big stakes for me.
I think I don't win, I could go.

459
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,919
>> PROBST: Welcome guys to
Tribal Beach.

460
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,881
First things first.
Tammy, you want to give back

461
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,217
that immunity necklace.
Thank you.

462
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,054
Once again, immunity, up for
grabs.

463
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,514
Okay.
Here's the deal.

464
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:12,894
Tonight's game is especially
tough because it takes place in

465
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,230
the dark.
First, you're going to run to

466
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,899
the end of the course and gather
firewood from the perimeter.

467
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,320
You will build a fire under a
wok to heat oil to pop popcorn.

468
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:25,740
Once you've popped one kernel
of popcorn, you'll move to a

469
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:29,077
final station where you will
light your pyre from the bottom

470
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,913
to ignite the top.
You'll start your fire in a way

471
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,083
you haven't done yet.
Magnesium, flint and steel.

472
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:40,755
First person to ignite the top
of their pyre wins immunity,

473
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:45,593
cannot be voted out, guaranteed
three more days in this game.

474
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,263
Everything clear?
Take your spots.

475
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,890
Wait for my go.
Survivors ready!

476
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,102
Go!
>> Whoa.

477
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,109
>> PROBST: Think about stuff
that's really going to ignite.

478
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:12,036
Coconut husks work really well.
There you go, V.

479
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:34,309
Coconut husks work really well.
There you go, V.

480
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:45,945
V has fire.
General's got fire.

481
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:51,701
V and the General have fire.
Everybody else is still working.

482
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,048
That a way Sean.
Keep it going.

483
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:11,846
Kathy's got fire.
Sean's got fire.

484
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:16,351
>> You don't got any matches, do
you, Jeff?

485
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,186
>> Yes!
>> PROBST: Neleh's got fire.

486
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,564
>> Whoo!
How close are we to having

487
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,358
popcorn?
Very close, look at that oil,

488
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,526
really heating up.
Let's go, General, get one

489
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,195
kernel to pop and you're moving
on.

490
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,571
>> I hear sizzle, man, I hear
sizzle.

491
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,656
Look at that, look at that.
Look at that.

492
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,033
It popped, right there.
>> PROBST: General, you got

493
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,369
popcorn, baby.
Moving on to the third station,

494
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,206
you're done here.
General's in the lead.

495
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,918
It's getting close.
Wok's heating up.

496
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,003
There it is.
V's got popcorn, moving to the

497
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,254
final station.
First one to ignite the top wins

498
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,048
immunity.
General's got a good healthy

499
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,259
fire going, V.
You'd better get that fire going

500
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:55,223
fast.
General's looking good, very

501
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:59,143
close.
Very close, General.

502
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:05,108
V's catching up.
They're neck and neck, guys.

503
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:11,114
>> Come on, baby. Yeah!
You're close, baby.

504
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:15,284
>> PROBST: General.
Yeah! Nice work.

505
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:24,585
Immunity, brother. Turn around
here and let me put this on.

506
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,839
>> Sanctuary.

507
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:36,472
>> PROBST: You cannot be voted
out. Congratulations.

508
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,515
>> You ain't going nowhere.

509
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,016
I'm going to try my damnedest.
(laughter)

510
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,749
>> How tall do you think this
is, you guys?

511
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,126
Probably about 250 feet, maybe
higher.

512
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,377
>> No, about 100 feet.
>> 100 feet?

513
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,007
>> Just won immunity, feeling a
little relieved, knowing I'm

514
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,634
definitely going to be here
another three days.

515
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,304
>> Who else gets this?
>> It's like being in a

516
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,555
torrential downpour and it's
gorgeous.

517
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:21,768
>> The win was very big for me,
just lifted me up and bringing

518
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,604
me back to life.
I was feeling a little down, and

519
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,190
now I'm feeling really good
about myself again.

520
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,193
That was refreshing.
I'm definitely a little bummed

521
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,820
that it looks like Tammy is on
the way out.

522
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,198
She's like a sister to me.
I'd like to see if I could do

523
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:39,202
something to save her.
>> I think Tammy has a play for

524
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,454
tonight.
I just don't know what it is.

525
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,165
I think it's something that's
going to get pulled out of a hat

526
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,960
and we're all going to come
tumbling down.

527
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,295
All right.
>> Over.

528
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:54,842
>> Hike, hike!
>> Over, hike, hike!

529
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,346
>> I'm not used to losing.
I'm super competitive.

530
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,225
And you know what?
I'm not giving up on this game

531
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:07,396
until I hear my name read at
Tribal Council.

532
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,233
>> I'm telling you something.
That Tammy is waiting for any

533
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,861
opening.
>> Oh, Tammy's waiting for

534
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,197
anything.
She's like a pit bull.

535
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,409
>> She's waiting there to take
advantage of something.

536
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,372
>> That's why I'm saying, you
know, if she comes up with some

537
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,918
plan, I can see her getting V
over on her side.

538
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:33,422
>> V has definitely flipped more
than anybody in this game.

539
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,552
Maybe Rob and Tammy could
somehow convince Sean and V

540
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,639
to join their pact.
>> A few moments we get to have.

541
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:46,394
If V and I hooked up with Tammy
and Rob, point blank, it would

542
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,230
put us in the final four.
My thing is, I'm approaching you

543
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,065
on this angle.
Neleh got mad game.

544
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,401
She's playing the girl next-door
role to the hilt.

545
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,528
It's important that V and I vote
Neleh off.

546
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,405
Because she's so young and
because she has this angelic

547
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,449
girl-next-door, everybody is
being deceived by aww, aww, and

548
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:04,537
not realizing the more sympathy
you have, the stronger this girl

549
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,250
gets.
She talks a good game, let's go

550
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,961
do this, let's go do this, but
don't do much but sleep and take

551
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,379
walks.
>> Every now and then she'll

552
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,590
turn around and pick up
something and make it look

553
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,341
like...
>> See, you see exactly what I'm

554
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,135
saying.
>> It would be a sure bet if V

555
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,721
and I hooked up with Tammy and
Rob, but then again, it might

556
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,348
not be a sure bet, because they
may very well go to the other

557
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,267
force, and say hey, look, these
two tried to hook up with us and

558
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,311
save their own ass.
Then we're on the chopping

559
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,938
block.
>> I'm ready to end this game in

560
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,773
a bang, baby.
We are close.

561
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,608
All right.
So we'll see what happens.

562
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:45,286
>> Okay.
>> PROBST: I will now bring in

563
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,332
the two members of our jury.
I'll remind you the jury is here

564
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,460
merely to observe.
This is the beginning of the

565
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:56,464
shift in the game, when the
power leaves those who are still

566
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,467
in it and goes now to those who
are out of it.

567
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,221
So how you vote becomes very
important in this game.

568
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:07,141
Tonight I want to talk about
what you are tired of, after 30

569
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:09,936
days.
Neleh.

570
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,980
>> A big part of it is that you
are covered in dirt.

571
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,484
You know, you wake up in the
morning, there's dirt and no-nos

572
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,362
stuck inside your eyes.
It's just, it's absolutely

573
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,322
disgusting, and I mean the
nights are bad here.

574
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,992
>> PROBST: Kathy?
>> I can't stay on the beach.

575
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,371
For various reasons, it's the
bugs, the monotony, it's the

576
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,665
grime.
And my skin is literally ready

577
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,293
to fall off, I've got so many
rashes and infections, it's

578
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,879
disgusting.
>> PROBST: Paschal, what are you

579
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,799
sick of out here?
>> Just the daily grinds, the

580
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:45,012
monotony, the same food, the
same living conditions, the same

581
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,472
everything.
And the closer we get to the

582
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,934
end, it seems the more
difficult it becomes.

583
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,812
>> PROBST: On a scale of one to
ten, how valuable was the reward

584
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:56,524
of going to a cruise ship and
being able to take a shower and

585
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,985
get clean clothes and have a
good meal?

586
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,988
>> Seven million.
Neleh and I sat on the deck of

587
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,825
that ship and talked about it.
There was nothing, nothing that

588
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:09,495
I could have received that would
have invigorated me more and

589
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,414
made me feel better.
It was absolutely amazing.

590
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,709
>> PROBST: Kathy, what was your
reaction?

591
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,545
Paschal and Neleh come back, not
only did they have a shower,

592
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:22,216
they're clipping their nails,.
They're doing a little buff pad,

593
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,509
I mean it was like they went to
a spa.

594
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,387
>> Hey, there is no doubt about
it, I was jealous.

595
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,723
I think all of us had a
difficult time listening to the

596
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,516
blow by blow description of
Neleh's shower.

597
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,937
But Paschal did an incredible
job on that challenge, man, so I

598
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,522
think when you win, you deserve
it.

599
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:40,568
And Neleh going, so be it.
But I wanted to get him really

600
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:44,613
dirty the next day.
>> PROBST: General, you own

601
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,408
immunity.
If it made sense, you could

602
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,660
assign that immunity to somebody
else.

603
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,581
Have you talked about that, is
there somebody here you want to

604
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,623
give that up to?
Do you feel safe enough?

605
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,752
>> No, I got to stay.
>> PROBST: It's time to vote.

606
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:07,928
Neleh, you're first.
>> Tammy, you're one cool chick

607
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:32,912
Neleh, you're first.
>> Tammy, you're one cool chick

608
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:37,208
but lethal competition.
Take it easy.

609
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,314
>> You don't seem to pull your
weight actually as much as

610
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:03,484
everybody else pulls theirs.
So that's why I'm voting for you

611
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:12,535
tonight.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

612
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:22,962
tonight.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

613
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:36,350
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

614
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:37,643
decision is final.
The person will be asked to

615
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,688
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

616
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:45,734
I'll read the votes.
First vote...

617
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:56,871
Tammy.
Tammy.

618
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:11,260
Vecepia.
Vecepia.

619
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:25,065
Two votes Tammy, two votes V.
That's three votes Tammy.

620
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,242
Tammy.
That's four, that's enough.

621
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:44,668
You need to bring me your torch.
Tammy, the tribe has spoken.

622
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,602
Well, you made it 30 days; I
know you're having a hard time,

623
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,563
but nobody ever said<i> Survivor</i>
was going to be easy.

624
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,398
Nine more days left.
Hang in there.

625
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:16,450
You guys can head back to camp.
Stay tuned for scenes

626
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:20,829
You guys can head back to camp.
Stay tuned for scenes

627
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,539
from our next episode.

628
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,588
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i> Only six remain at

629
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,424
Soliantu, and island life has
taken its toll on all of them.

630
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,427
>> We're just depleted energy
wise, and it's really uncanny to

631
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,637
see what's happening with our
mental stability.

632
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,474
>> PROBST: And an event occurs
that will shakeup the entire

633
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,184
tribe.
>> It takes an experience like

634
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,479
this to realize what really is
important in your life.

635
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:56,323
>> Even though I knew tonight
was coming, and it was my turn,

636
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,785
it still sucks to be voted off.
I've played this game exactly

637
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:03,664
the way I said I was going to
play it and I'm proud of the way

638
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,958
I played it.
This is the game of<i> Survivor,</i>

639
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,543
the people that are left, I hope
that they have it in them to

640
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,795
last the rest of the time,
because I'm not so sure they do.
