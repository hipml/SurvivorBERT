through it, Jonathan frustrated.

-Can't even watch anymore.
-LINDSAY: Yup, and then one
to the...

491
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,437
And then the one to the left.

492
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,939
PROBST:
It is hard to describe

493
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,774
how long Omar has been working.

494
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,978
PROBST:
Somebody is going home tonight.

495
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,746
Rocksroy for the win.

496
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,848
(cheering, screaming)

497
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,352
There it is! Ika wins immunity
and a large tarp.

498
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,755
Nobody going home.

499
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,956
Oh, my God.

500
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,391
PROBST:
We're looking for one more.

501
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,760
Immunity on the line.

502
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,995
-Oh!
-PROBST: Mike takes a big fall.

503
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,429
-So close.
-Go, go, go.

504
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,131
Bring that one
down the middle. Yup.

505
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,699
And then we should have it.

506
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,701
-Okay.
-All right.
-PROBST: Now you go.

507
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,638
There you go, Taku. Let's go!
Jonathan takes the key.

508
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,973
With one chop releases the bags!

509
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,708
Come on, Vati.
You got this!

510
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,976
PROBST:
There goes Chanelle trying

511
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,645
to knock down the first target.

512
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,346
Suddenly,
Taku could be back in this

513
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:25,350
because Vati has yet to get any
rhythm going on the slingshot.

514
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,086
-Go. Go, go! Go!
-Another horrible misfire.

515
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,555
It's going to be Jonathan in.

516
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,058
And right now,
we are back at even.

517
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,560
-It is Jonathan and Mike.
-OMAR: Yeah, you got this.

518
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,962
LINDSAY:
All the way back,
all the way back.

519
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,664
-Yes!
-Oh!
-PROBST: Jonathan knocks down

520
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,365
-the first target for Taku.
-LINDSAY: Right there.

521
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,901
PROBST:
Taku took forever to get here,

522
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,704
-but they are back in it.
-(cheering)

523
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,006
PROBST:
Mike knocks down
the first target for Vati.

524
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,875
We are tied now!

525
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,209
One target left.
Here comes Chanelle.

526
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,277
Here comes Jonathan.

527
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,180
-Oh!
-So close, babe.

528
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,315
Just misses.
Jonathan for the win.

529
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,418
Here comes Mike.

530
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,922
-And he's got it!
-(cheering, screaming)

531
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,092
Taku wins immunity and tarps.

532
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,461
Sending Vati to Tribal Council,

533
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,196
where somebody will be voted out

534
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,098
-of<i> Survivor 42.</i>
-Hey, good job.

535
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,502
-My God.
-PROBST: Big comeback.

536
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,404
-We were so close.
-So freaking...

537
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,106
It was close.

538
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,811
Ika, nice job.
Immunity is yours.

539
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,480
Nobody going home.

540
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,481
(exhales)

541
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,216
Come grab your big tarp.

542
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:37,589
Taku, nice comeback.
Immunity is yours again.

543
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,758
Who wants to grab the tarp?

544
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,861
Smaller, but it will get
the job done for sure.

545
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,697
-Amen, Mr. Jeff.
-PROBST: Mr. Jeff.

546
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,133
-Mr. Jeff.
-Still not used to it.

547
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,469
-(laughter)
-All right,
before I send you on your way,

548
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,671
two players gonna be taking
a journey today.

549
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,307
Ika, pick somebody from Vati
to take the journey.

550
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:59,377
They cannot have gone
on a journey this season.

551
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,880
-Okay.
-Who you going to send?

552
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,349
-Lydia.
-PROBST: All right,
Lydia's gonna go on a journey.

553
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,052
Now, one person's
gonna join her.

554
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,455
It can be from Taku,
or it can be from your tribe.

555
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,391
-Yeah, you can go.
-I'm gonna go.
-Go for it.

556
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,460
-PROBST: Who's it gonna be?
-Rocks.
-Rocks.

557
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,530
Rocksroy and Lydia,
grab your stuff, head out.

558
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,701
You'll return back to your tribe
before Tribal Council tonight.

559
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,836
Ika, you've got the tarp.
Your flint

560
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,605
will be waiting for you
back at camp.

561
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,341
-(whooping) Bye.
-Grab your stuff,
no Tribal tonight.

562
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,476
Taku, grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

563
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,645
-No Tribal Council tonight.
-Thanks, Jeff.

564
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,580
PROBST:
All right, Vati,
Tribal Council tonight.

565
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,784
Somebody will be voted out
of this game.

566
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,086
Before you go,
I need your flint.

567
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,855
-It's for you, Jeff.
-Thanks, Chanelle.

568
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,457
You'll have a chance
to win it back

569
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,691
at the next immunity challenge.
Grab your stuff,

570
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,426
head back to camp.

we are still a Vati family

I feel like

my head is also
on the chopping block,

595

603
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,239
I'm with you to the end.
That's all I have to say.

604
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,741
-Out of you and Chanelle...
-Mm-hmm.

605
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,343
...I trust you more.

606
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,511

Chanelle's going home.
-Yeah, yeah.

-Period. I don't trust her.
-Yeah.

608
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,482
I think if I get
to the merge with her,

609
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,351
she's going to flip immediately.

610
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,552
And I'm worried
she wouldn't just flip.

611
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,553
She would kind of drag us.

612
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,854
-Yes.
-Yeah.

613
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,556
<i>I think Chanelle needs to go</i>

614
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,224
<i>because I agree with Hai.</i>

615
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,226
<i>She's likely</i>
<i>to flip at the merge.</i>

616
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,794
So if you know
someone's going to flip,

617
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,763
it's better to get rid of 'em
when you can

618
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,431
than to wait for them
to flip on you.

619
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,070
He's definitely going.

620
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,773
-Yeah.
-We have to.

621
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,775
-Yeah. Yeah.
-We have to for so many reasons.

00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,910
<i>CHANELLE:</i>
<i>I think the consensus is,</i>

623
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,611
everyone wants Daniel gone.

624
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,947

writing his name down?

00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,548
-Absolutely. It's...
-Great. We're good. Sold.

-If everything's...
Daniel's go...

Daniel's going home.
-Got it.

<i>Daniel has one arm, he hasn't</i>
<i>competed in any challenges.</i>

629
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,692
Not only that. I think people
seeing him go swimming yesterday

630
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,328
was also something that kind of
set them over the edge.

631
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,631
I just got to make sure
he feels confident enough

632
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,100
-that he doesn't play...
-Yeah.

633
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,635

goes home, I will still be able

00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,046
-to sleep
a little better tonight.
-100%.

-Yeah.

As long as me, you and Lydia
don't go home.

639
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,784
Yeah, we really have to evaluate

640
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,053
which one of these two
will be best for us long-term.

00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,821
we're gonna lose
a member of our tribe,

819
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,723
but it doesn't mean
that we're not solid.

820
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,958
Daniel,
what do you read into that?

821
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,360
DANIEL:
Mike is a straight shooter.

822
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,562
Mike, to his core,
is a team guy.

823
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,330
Some people come into this game,

824
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,466
and from the get-go, they're
playing an individual game.

825
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,835
And I don't think you can
win<i> Survivor</i> doing that.

826
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,037
And Mike is not
one of those people.

827
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,973
PROBST:
So then, Hai,
how do you vote somebody out

828
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,242
if Mike's story is accurate?

829
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,211
Which is,
we're just one firehouse,

830
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,679
but somebody's got to go.

831
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,014
Yeah, this game is hard.

832
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,284
I see five
autonomous players here

833
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,986
who all have the goal
of getting to the end.

834
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,490
So unfortunately
someone here is being lied to,

835
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:53,791
or multiple people.

836
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,361
PROBST:
Daniel, let's go with Hai's idea

837
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,096
that somebody's being lied to.

838
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,698
Give me an analogy
from your world

839
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,934
-where lying is fun.
-Oh, geez.

840
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,935
It's part of it.

841
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,436
I should be honest with you,
Jeff,

842
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,205
I'm not an analogy guy.

843
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,240
But, sorry, can I jump back
on the Mike thing?

844
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,008
-Yeah.
-DANIEL: When he talks
about teams,

845
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,678
he's not talking about teams
just in<i> Survivor.</i>

846
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:17,048
I think Mike sees this as a team
for, like, the rest of his life.

847
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:18,883
And by that I mean the very end.

848
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,084
That's-that's true. Um...

849
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,186
Wait, when you said
"to the very end,"

850
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,422
-you mean until you are dying.
-DANIEL: Yeah, I think, I think,

851
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,892
-I think, like, hopefully
I-I live longer than Mike.
-(chuckles)

852
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,561
-Um... Yeah.
-It's a very good possibility.

853
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,930
Yeah, but, like,
I feel like Mike and I

854
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,799
will probably, you know,
be friends

855
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,300
to the very end
of whoever goes first.

856
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,802
-Knock on wood it's not me.
-HAI: Well...

857
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,538
Mike's 117, so we don't know
how much longer he has.

858
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:41,606
(laughter)

859
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,708
-116. 116.
-Yeah. Yeah.

860
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,879
Jeff, I actually want to
jump in because I think that,

861
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,114
like, the two different themes
that you're noting--

862
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,116
friendship and then
the game of<i> Survivor--</i>

863
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,618
I think we're
seeing it come to play, like,

864
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,886
right here in front of us.

865
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,822
Because Daniel's comment right
there is him playing the game,

866
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,158
playing to Mike's soft spot,
his heart.

867
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,227
Let me just go
and pat Mike on the back again.

868
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,328
Team, friendship.

869
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,464
And so, like, that's
playing the game right there.

870
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,798
It's almost kind of
milking it a bit.

871
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,134
PROBST:
Daniel, that was pretty clear.

872
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,335
She doesn't buy it.

873
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,337
You might mean it,
but right now

874
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,473
you're saying it
because you're at Tribal.

875
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,142
I didn't mean any game strategy
by that, to be totally honest.

876
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,744
I try to be
as genuine as possible.

877
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,879
Like, there are things
that I could have kept secret.

878
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,981
I mean, I'm a leukemia survivor.

879
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,050
I could have kept that secret,

880
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,386
but I cannot play this game
without being true to who I am.

881
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,454
And, yes, you have to
lie sometimes and stuff,

882
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,789
but I analogize that to, like...

883
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,925
I have an analogy, actually.
Yes.

884
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,093
Okay, I analogize that
to boxing.

885
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,595
You know, like, Muhammad Ali

886
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,597
was one of the best boxers
in the entire world.

887
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,832
He didn't go down the street
punching random people.

888
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,467
He only punched people
when he was boxing.

889
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,670
Right? So when
we're playing<i> Survivor,</i> we lie,

890
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,271
but in our real lives,
we don't lie.

891
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,372
It's just, like,
part of the game.

892
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,808
PROBST:
So, Lydia,
then what would a vote

893
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,077
be based on tonight
with this tribe?

894
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,146
What are some of the criteria
that might come up?

895
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,415
LYDIA:
You know, after tonight,

896
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,383
each tribe is gonna be
four, four and four.

897
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,053
And so no one has numbers,
you know?

898
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,656
And we're speculating a merge,
you know, coming up.

899
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,124
Hopefully soon.

900
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,459
-Please.
-We've been talking
about that feast.

901
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,596
Even if it was rice, we're like,
"All right, we'll take it."

902
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,598
So I think one of
the criteria is, like,

903
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:17,234
who can I trust the most
going forward?

904
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,638
Especially in a game where
the numbers are not obvious.

905
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,873
All right, so, Hai, for Lydia,
she's saying it's trust.

906
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,942
-HAI: Yeah.
-PROBST: How about for you?

907
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:29,080
100%, trust is the most
valuable currency out here.

908
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,116
If you look back at
the last Tribal we were at...

909
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,252
...there were six blindsides.

910
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,289
And when trust is broken,
it's very hard to win back.

911
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,725
So for me,
it's about establishing trust,

912
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,994
'cause I want
to make it to the end.

913
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,629
-Daniel, you're nodding.
-I mean, unless you're

914
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,998
one of the greatest players
ever-- and I'm not one--

915
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,433
you get burned at least once.

916
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,136
You have to be able
to look past the burn,

917
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,705
and sometimes, when you were
the one who did the burning,

918
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,840
ask for forgiveness.

919
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,141
If you can't do that,

920
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,310
I think you're gonna play
a short<i> Survivor</i> game.

921
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,846
PROBST:
Chanelle, if you're
keeping the people

922
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,115
that are most trustworthy,
then the person

923
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,451
you're getting rid of
has to be the least trustworthy.

924
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,388
Uh, I think that's what
someone reasonable would deduct

925
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,889
from what we're hearing,
so, yes.

926
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,792
Wow, is it hard
for you to answer that question?

927
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,761
CHANELLE:
No, I mean,
the writing's on the wall.

928
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,663
Like, a reasonable conclusion
would be that

929
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,866
if we are voting based on trust,
the person who is voted out

930
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:25,036
is ultimately
not high in that category--

931
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:26,337
the least trustworthy.

932
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,806
PROBST:
And, Mike, you do have
to make those decisions.

933
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,641
It doesn't mean,
to your point earlier,

934
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,077
that you might not like
this person personally,

935
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,413
but in this game
it's just not my best move.

936
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,014
My vote tonight
is strictly gameplay.

937
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,251
Has nothing to do with
how I personally feel at all.

938
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,919
I want to be friends
with whoever gets voted off

939
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,254
here tonight
for the rest of my life.

940
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,855

Good night.

<i>PROBST: Next time on a two-hour</i>
<i>episode of</i> Survivor...

991
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,997
Everybody drop your buffs.

-LYDIA: Oh, my God!

993
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,867
So, is this called the merge?

994
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,135
Not exactly.

995
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,436
Oh...

996
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,705
This is the biggest moment
in the game so far.

997
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,642
It is going to be,
uh, just chaos.

998
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,944
I'm gonna keep fighting
in this game till I'm dead.

999
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,015
<i>I got totally blindsided. I</i>
<i>would have preferred to execue</i>

1000
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:34,318
<i>the blindside, but at least</i>
<i>I got a form of blindside.</i>

1001
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,053
<i>That's part of</i>
<i>the</i> Survivor<i> experience.</i>

1002
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,521
<i>If I could</i>
<i>have scripted my life,</i>

1003
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,024
<i>I probably wouldn't have</i>
<i>given myself leukemia, right?</i>

1004
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,792
<i>And if I could</i>
<i>have scripted</i> Survivor,

1005
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,928
<i>I probably would</i>
<i>have had myself winning,</i>

1006
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,597
<i>but the beauty of life</i>
<i>is that it's unscripted.</i>

1007
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,232
That's how we find
meaning in it.
