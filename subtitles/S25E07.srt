DID SHE CATCH WIND OF IT AND

00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,036
AND I COULDN'T CONVINCE HER

100
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,247

WE'RE TWO GUYS TAKING A SHOT IN

00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,803
THE DARK AT EACH OTHER, AND

110
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,054
THERE'S GOING TO COME A TIME AND

111
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,973
A PLACE AND I HOPE I CAN GET TO

112
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,892

DO I HAVE TO KEEP MY EYES AND

129
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,956

WE'RE HOPING THERE'S DESCENT

197
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,631

198
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,259
OR TWO PEOPLE TO COME OVER TO

199
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,844
OUR SIDE TO USE FOR A WHILE AND

200
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,720
THUT THEM OFF IF WE CAN.

201
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,513

WE NEED TWO TO SHIFT THAT

BALANCE AND HAVE A MAJORITY.

211
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,107

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,502

IN WEEKS TO R.C. AND I.

290
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,731
AND SO WE'RE REALLY FREE AGENTS.

291
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,859
SO BEING A FREE AGENT MEANS YOU

292
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,610
GET TO CHOOSE YOUR TEAM.

293
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,987
IT JUST TAKES TWO.

294
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,280
>> I THINK DENISE WILL TALK TO

295
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:14,822
ME A LITTLE BIT MORE JUST

296
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,824
BECAUSE OF THE SWIMMING

297
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,116
CONNECTION.

298
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,785
>> YOU SHOULD ACT AS A SPY THEN

299
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,411
TO GET INFORMATION.

300
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,747
>> I KNOW, BUT JUST AS MUCH YOU

301
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,789
WANT ME TO GET INFORMATION I

302
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,790
WORRY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE

303
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,085
AREN'T ONING, BIG, HAPPY FAMILY.

304
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:28,878
WE CAN PRETEND TO BE ALL WE

306
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:32,465
DAYS.

307
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,758
>> IT'S TRUE.

00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,082
SHELTER YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY

309
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,708
HI.

310
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,836
>> THAT'S A LOT OF BAMBOO.

311
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,173
WE CAN'T MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF

312
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:18,177
THAT, THEN, GET US BACK TO THE

313
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,386
COUCH.

314
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,804
>> ON THE NEW BEACH, I THOUGHT,

315
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,390
WELL, THE GUYS ARE MAKE THE

316
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:22,598
SHELTER.

317
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,808
I'LL JUST HANG EVERYBODY'S

318
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:24,725
CLOTHES OUT AND GET THEM SOME

319
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,062
SUN SO WE DON'T GO TO SLEEP WITH

320
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,438
WET CLOTHES.

321
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,357
AND THEN I PICKED UP MALCOLM'S

322
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,733
BAG, AND I TOOK HIS FLANNEL

323
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,776
SHIRT OUT, AND I TOOK HIS

324
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,735
BATHING SUIT OUT AND I WAS

325
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:41,075
LOOKING IN THERE AND I FELT

326
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:41,534
SOMETHING.

327
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,120
I'VE DISCOVERED HE HAD THE

328
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,496
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IN HIS BAG

329
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,333
WHICH TOTALLY SHOCKED ME.

330
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,794
>> ALL THE CLOTHES ARE LAID OUT.

331
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,628
AND IT WAS WRAPPED UP.

332
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,337
>> UH-HUH.

333
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,004
>> AND WAS LIKE--

334
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:54,797
>> LISA.

335
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,090
LISA DID THAT.

336
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,217
>> I NEED TO TALK TO LISA RIGHT

337
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,384
NOW.

338
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,137
>> NO, BECAUSE -- OF NO, BECAUSE

339
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,221
LISA WAS PULLING OUT CLOTHES.

340
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:02,930
>> I WAS GOING TO CHANGE CLOTHES

341
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,849
AND HIDE THE IDOL.

342
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,642
I THOUGHT AN HOUR WOULD BE A

343
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,936
SAFE AMOUNT OF TIME ASSUMING

344
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,354
PEOPLE WOULD BE EATING AND

345
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,398
DRINKING AND KNOWING EACH OTHER.

346
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,318
PAECIAL THE ESTROGEN CLICKED IN

347
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,737
AND WE HAD TO HAVE OUR CLOTHES

348
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:18,988
CLEANED.

349
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,989
>> OH, CRAP, MALCOLM.

350
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,824
>> NOW I HAVE TO PIN DOWN SWEET

351
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,742
OLD LISA WHO I THINK, OUT OF THE

352
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,035
GOODNESS OF HER HEART, IS TRYING

353
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,454
TO DRY MY CLOTHES.

354
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:26,829
I GET HER ALONE.

355
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,747
I DON'T SAY A WORD.

356
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,165
I JUST LOOK AT HER.

357
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,459
>> LET ME TELL YOU THIS.

358
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,918
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL

359
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,085
ME?

360
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,253
>> I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

361
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,212
>> I KNEW IT.

362
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,422
>> I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

363
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,590
I PROMISE I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

364
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,258
>> OH, MY GOD.

365
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,551
I'M LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO BE

366
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:40,843
KIDDING ME.

367
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,802
>> I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

368
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,388
HONESTLY, I WAS JUST TRYING TO

369
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,598
AIR OUT EVERYBODY'S LAUNDRY.

370
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,891
>> I SAID SHE'S SO SWEET.

371
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,976
SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO BE NICE.

372
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,644
>> I REALLY WAS.

373
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,854
>> I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.

374
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,856
>> IT'S ME, YOU, AND DENISE

375
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,023
KNOW.

376
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,734
ME AND DENISE HAVE BEEN SUPER

377
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,610
TIGHT SINCE THE BEGINNING.

378
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:57,943
>> OKAY.

379
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,905
>> AND YOU'RE MY NEW MOMMA AND

380
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,198
NOOSE JUST HOW IT'S GOING TO BE.

381
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,741
IT'S THE THREE OF US TO THE END.

382
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,408
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT.

383
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:04,825
>> OKAY.

384
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,827
>> HALLELUJAH.

385
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,828
THE CHURCH LADY FOUND IT, WHO

386
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,954
HOPEFULLY HAS A HEART.

387
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,915
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, NOW I'M

388
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,667
LOCKED INTO THIS INVOLUNTARY

389
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,377
ALLIANCE WITH LISA AND

390
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:15,628
DENEETION.

391
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,670
IT'S LITERALLY THE TWO PEOPLE

392
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,796
I'M NOT CONFIDENT I CAN BEAT IN

393
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,672
THE FINAL THREE.

394
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,257
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NICE, BUT

395
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,092
THE WHOLE DYNAMICS COULD SHIFT,

396
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,011
AND THE ENTIRE CAMP IS GOING

397
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:24,970
CRAZY WITH SCRAMBLING.

398
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,639
>> I'M SORRY.

399
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,474
>> YOU GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK.

400
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,434
>> MALCOLM PROMISED FINAL THREE

401
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,561
WITH ME AND DENISE, AND THAT'S

402
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,563
REALLY NICE.

403
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,981
BUT YOU KIND OF HAVE TO TAKE ALL

404
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:36,982
THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

405
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,694
I'M NOT THE ONLY ACTOR ON THIS

406
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:40,903
ISLAND.

407
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:47,785
SO I COULD BE BEING PLAYED.

408
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,806
>> OH, THAT'S AMAZING.

409
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,393
>> I HAVEN'T HAD TO DEAL WITH

410
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:12,560
IT.

411
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,060
>> THEY'RE TOO YOUNG.

412
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:13,936
>> I KNOW.

413
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,355
I'M SHOCKED.

414
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,898
>> YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST SO

415
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,484
MUCH FUN TO JUST GET TO BE ME.

416
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:20,901
>> YEAH.

417
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,988
>> SO PENNER IS AWARE OF MY PAST

418
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,698
AS A CHILD STAR.

419
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,492
BUT WE DIDN'T TALK STRATEGY.

420
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,035
AND IF WE WEREN'T ON THIS

421
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,121
ISLAND, WE WOULD HAVE A REALLY

422
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,664
GREAT TIME OVER LUNCH, JUST

423
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,040
TALKING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S

424
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:35,249
LIVES.

425
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,585
AND IF YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF

426
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,128
CONNECTION, THAT IS VALUABLE,

427
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,129
ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO END UP

428
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:44,133
ALIGNED LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD.

429
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,135
>> YOU JUST NEVER, EVER REALLY

430
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,428
KNOW IF SOMEBODY LIKES YOU FOR

431
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,053
YOU AND TO HAVE THESE

432
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,096
FRIENDSHIPS ALREADY THAT REALLY

433
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,891
ARE TOTALLY BASED ON LIKING ME

434
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,934
FOR ME.

435
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,062
IS VERY HEALING IN A REALLY DEEP

436
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:57,313
WAY.

437
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,564
>> YEAH.

438
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,189
>> YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE

439
00:14:59,273 --> 00:14:59,982
THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I

440
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,484
WOULD TAKE FROM THIS.

441
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:07,948
>> LISA HAD BEEN ON "FACT OF

442
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,200
LIFE," BUT NOW AS WITH MANY,

443
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,328
MANY FORMER ACTORS YOU GET OLDER

444
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,537
AND SO YOU DO OTHER THINGS WITH

445
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,872
YOUR LIFE.

446
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,998
LISA IS KIND OF A COOL LADY.

447
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,125
I THINK SHE COULD ACTUALLY GO

448
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,962
PRETTY FAR AS AN UNDER-THE-RADAR

449
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,505
NONTHREATENING PERSON WHO COULD

450
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,173
FIND HERSELF SITTING AT A FINAL

451
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:24,340
THREE.

452
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,300
I BELIEVE THAT.

453
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,259
I WON'T BLOW YOUR COVER.

454
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:34,058
>> THANK YOU.

455
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,108
>> THEY'VE GOT THE NUMBERS NOW.

456
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,818
THEY COULD VOTE YOU AND I OUT IF

457
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,153
THEY WANT TO.

458
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,196
THAT'S MY FIRST CONCERN, FIRST

459
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,742
AND FOREMOST, IS JUST HOW TO

460
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:51,992
SURVIVE.

461
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,619
>> THE RETURNING PLAYER BULL'S

462
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:53,869
EYE.

463
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,204
>> THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE

464
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,497
SMARTEST MOVE?

465
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,418
I'M TRYING TO FIND FISSURES IN

466
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,795
THIS YELLOW TRIBE AND SKUPIN

467
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,129
SEEMS LIKE A COOL GUY.

468
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,131
SO I GOT TO HELP HIM FEEL AS

469
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,092
COMFORTABLE AS HE CAN ABOUT

470
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:08,676
SLITTING THE THROATS OF THE

471
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,135
PEOPLE HE SPENT 17 DAYS WITH.

472
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,637
YOU KNOW.

473
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,179
SO I'M TRYING TO DO THAT.

474
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,056
MY BACK'S AGAINST THE WALL, TOO.

475
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,765
>> RIGHT.

476
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,600
>> YOU KNOW, I'M NEGOTIATING

477
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,394
WITH WHAT LITTLE I HAVE, WHICH

478
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,062
IS I GOT FOUR LOYAL PEOPLE.

479
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,606
I HAVE A REALLY SERIOUS BLOC.

480
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,148
IF YOU AND I CAN FIGURE

481
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,275
SOMETHING OUT, THAT WOULD BE

482
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:31,073
INCREDIBLE.

483
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:37,496
>> WHAT PERCENT ARE YOU ON

484
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:37,788
REALIGNMENT?

485
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,248
>> I MEAN, IT'S HARD.

486
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,000
>> GIVE A NUMBER RIGHT NOW.

487
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:42,668
JUST GIVE A NUMBER.

488
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,086
>> I'M 50-50.

489
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,713
THERE ARE A LOT OF DYNAMICS WORK

490
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,171
RIGHT NOW.

491
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,881
ME AND MIKE ARE SOILED, BUT WE

492
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,507
WOULD LIKE TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT

493
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,425
MORE SECURE.

494
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:55,431
>> I-- I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN

495
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,101
TRUST, WE'RE TANDANG, LET'S STAY

496
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,352
TANDANG, AND WHEN WE GET TO

497
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,019
SEVEN GAME ON.

498
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,271
>> GAME ON, I KNOW.

499
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,441
THE OLD TAN BANG TRIBE MADE IT

500
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,150
OBVIOUS ABOUT ME AND MIKE.

501
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,736
THEY OFTSIDES US BOTH FOR 17

502
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:08,944
DAYS.

503
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,071
SO PENNER CORRALLED HIS

504
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,239
THREESOME, AND I HAVE MIKE,

505
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,659
OBVIOUSLY, ON MY SIDE, SO THAT'S

506
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:15,826
SIX.

507
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,119
SO WHY WOULDN'T WE DO SOMETHING?

508
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,121
IF WE HAVE A POSSIBLE CHANCE TO

509
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,707
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE, JUDGE IN NOT.

510
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,125
>> WE NEED TO TAKE BABY STEPS.

511
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:28,505
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

512
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,590
>> I DON'T WANT A VETERAN TO

513
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,885
WIN, AND I LIKE THEM--

514
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,928
>> EVEN GET RID OF MIKE, TOO.

515
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,388
>> GET PENNER OUT OF HERE.

516
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:36,889
I DON'T WANT HIM TO WIN.

517
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:37,389
>> HE'S HAD HIS CHANCE.

518
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,599
>> RIGHT.

519
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,559
I THINK HE HAS THE IDOL, THOUGH.

520
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,268
>> HE MAY.

521
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,227
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE IT.

522
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,355
IF HE'S GOT THE IDOL--

523
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,231
>> IT HAS TO BE A BLINDSIDE.

524
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,068
>> AND I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO

525
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:50,486
HELP PLATOON THAT.

526
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,155
>> I KNOW PENNER'S GOT THE IDOL.

527
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,449
NOBODY ELSE KNOWS FOR SURE IF HE

528
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,242
DOES OR NOT, BUT I KNOW HE DOES.

529
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,120
AND I'LL JOIN ANY GANG AS LONG

530
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,289
AS I CAN GET PENNER OUT BEFORE I

531
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,624
GET OUT.

532
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,583
>> R.C. IS DANGEROUS.

533
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,292
>> SHE IS, ISN'T SHE?

534
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,795
>> SHE'S NUMBER ONE.

535
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,337
NUMBER TWO-- NUMBER TWO IS

536
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,299
EITHER PENNER OR MIKE.

537
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,260
>> AND I CAN GET CARTER, DENISE.

538
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,595
>> WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S A

539
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,138
FOUR-FOUR TIE, WE PLAY IT FOUR

540
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:22,309
FOR R.C. AND WE PLAY IT FOUR FOR

541
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:22,518
PENNER.

542
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,354
>> FOUR-FOUR IS ALL YOU NEED.

543
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,231
>> PERFECT.

544
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,733
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

545
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,401
>> LITTLE CLIQUE INSIDE OF

546
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,861
TANDANG IS OPERATING UNDER THE

547
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,445
ASSUMPTION THAT PENNER HAS AN

548
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,238
IDOL, BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE

549
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,824
NUMBERS WITHIN OUR OWN TRIBE TO

550
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,407
BE ABLE TO SPLIT THE VOTE AND

551
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:41,119
GET RID OF HIM SO WE HAVE TO

552
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,287
PULL IN JEFF, DENISE, AND

553
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:42,538
INDICATOR.

554
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,457
>> PENNER PLAYS THE IDOL, WE

555
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,292
FLUSH THE IDOL AND R.C. IS GONE.

556
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,294
>> WE COULD SPLIT THE VOTE

557
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,963
BETWEEN PENNER AND R.C.

558
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,382
PEB PENNER HAS AN IDOL HE HAS TO

559

AS THE CHALLENGE GOES ON, THAT

595
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,017
WEIGHT WILL BECOME TOO MUCH TO

>> Jeff: EACH BUCKET HAS 25%

616
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,815
OF YOUR BODY WEIGHT.

617
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,900

THAT'S HOW QUICKLY IT CAN

00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,639
SLIDE RIGHT OVER HERE.

747
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,559
CARTER, COME ON OVER.

748
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,811
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

749
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,770
>> GO, CARTER!

750
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,106
>> Jeff: CARTER, SAFE AT

751
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,025
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

752
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,694
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, TONIGHT

753
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,112
YOUR SHOT AT THE MILLION DOLLARS

754
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,406
WILL COME TO AN END.

755
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,449
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

756
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,325
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

757
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:58,825
SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

758
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,661
>> I'M ACSTATIC THAT PEB PENNER

759
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,913
AND R.C. DIDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE

760
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,914
TO WINNING IMMUNITY BECAUSE

761
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,958
WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTE

762
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:07,876
BETWEEN PENNER AND R.C., AND IF

763
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,878
PENNER PLAYS THE IDOL, R.C. GOES

764
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,920
HOME.

765
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:11,838
IF PENNER DOESN'T PLAY THE IDOL,

766
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,507
HE'LL GO HOME WITH THE IDOL.

767
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,205
SO FAR.

768
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,873
NO, I DIDN'T WIN IMMUNITY, BUT

769
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,833
WE SORT OF HAVE THIS VERY COOR

770
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,001
SIX IN PLACE RIGHT NOW.

771
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,878
ME AND MIKE ARE SOLID, AND WE

772
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,547
ARE DEFINITELY WITH KALABAW.

773
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,091
WITH US SIX WE ARE IN THE

774
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:00,845
MAJORITY.

775
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,182
>> I NEVER HAVE EVER FELT

776
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:08,228
THREATENED BEFORE, AND TONIGHT,

777
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,397
RETURNING PLAYERS ARE A MAJOR

778
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:10,605
THREAT.

779
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,941
LIKE, MY REPUTATION IS PRETTY

780
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,233
COMPETITIVE.

781
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,693
MY REPUTATION ISN'T BEING LOYAL

782
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,277
TO A TRIBE THAT HASN'T BEEN

783
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,446
LOYAL TO ME.

784
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,239
THERE ISN'T ANYBODY THAT WOULD

785
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,532
THINK THAT I WOULD GO DOWN

786
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:27,789
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

787
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,388
I CAN'T PLAY THE GAME WITH THEM.

788
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,265
>> YEAH.

789
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,934
BIGGEST HANG-UP I HAVE OF ALL

790
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:48,977
THIS IS I DON'T WANT TO LET

791
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,980
PENNER BEAT ME OUT IN THIS GAME.

792
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:56,609
IT'S AND YOU PENNER GET

793
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,152
TOGETHER, AND THERE ARE TWO

794
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,236
VETERAN GUYS.

795
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,571
LET'S TAKE IT TO THE END.

796
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,614
SO WE GET SCREWED.

797
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,575
THAT'S THE OWNING THING I WORRY

798
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:03,783
ABOUT.

799
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,909
>> I CAN TELL WITH YOU INTEGRITY

800
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,954
THAT I WOULD FOLLOW YOU GUYS.

801
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,373
IT JUST TAKES TWO PEOPLE FROM

802
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,042
TANDANG TO REALIGN WITH THE

803
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:13,710
KALABAW TRIBE.

804
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,879
THEN THEY WOULD BE SIX STRONG.

805
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,382
UNLESS GOD HIMSELF APPEARS LIVE

806
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:23,761
BEFORE ME AND SPEAKS TO ME, I

807
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,805
CANNOT FOLLOW PETE, ARTIS, AND

808
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,224
ABI, AS LONG AS I HAVE SOME

809
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,185
ASSURANCE THAT JEFF AND CARTER

810
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,145
AREN'T GOING TO SWITCH OVER TO

811
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:32,937
THE OLD TANDANG TRIBE.

812
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,523
BECAUSE IF R.C. AND I GO THIS

813
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,609
WAY, AND JEFF AND CARTER GO THIS

814
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,818
WAY, WHAT HAPPENS?

815
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:45,033
NOTHING GOT GAINED.

816
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,827
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, MAN?

817
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,287
SO THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF

818
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,623
HERE IS YOU AND I HOLD THE KEY.

819
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,041
>> YUP.

820
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,293
>> SO I DON'T KNOW.

821
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:55,835
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

822
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,673
>> WELL, IT'S JONATHAN, SKUPIN,

823
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,550
R.C., DENISE, YOU, ME, THAT'S

824
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:02,842
ALL WE NEED.

825
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,802
>> YUP.

826
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:04,969
SIX.

827
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:09,140
WE JUST NEED SIX.

828
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,308
>> I DON'T KNOW.

829
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,393
DO YOU THINK WE COULD GET

830
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,019
FARTHER WITH SKUPIN AND PENNER?

831
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,605
>> I JUST HAD A GOOD

832
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,856
CONVERSATION WITH SKUPIN, AND I

833
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,441
JUST SAID, "LOOK, IF I DO THIS

834
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,069
WITH YOU, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME

835
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,737
THAT PENNER WILL NOT STAY HERE

836
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,405
LONGER THAN US."

837
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,949
AND HE GAVE ME HIS WORD HE WOULD

838
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:30,286
VOTE WITH US TO GET PENNER OUT.

839
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,372
THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS HOW

840
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,124
MUCH-- I MEAN WE BUILT SOME KIND

841
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,293
OF VALUE WITH PENNER.

842
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:37,544
>> YEAH.

843
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:41,548
>> IF YOU AND I JUMP AND GO OVER

844
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,716
TO THE YELLOW TRIBE, YOU AND I

845
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,510
JUST MAY BE ON THE BOTTOM.

846
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,806
>> HERE COMES PENNER BEHIND US.

847
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,140
>> WHAT'S UP, PENNER?

848
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,268
>> HOW WE DOING?

849
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,061
>> GOOD.

850
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,521
>> WE'RE JUST TALKING THROUGH

851
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,231
ALL THE B.S. WE HAVE BEEN

852
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:58,439
HEARING.

853
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,107
>> WELL, LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHERE

854
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,567
I STAND.

855
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,986
AND I'M TOTALLY WITH YOU GUYS.

856
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,737
I HOPE THE HELL YOU'RE NOT GOING

857
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,489
TO VOTE WITH THEM AGAINST ME

858
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:06,739
TONIGHT.

859
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,116
YOU HAVE MY LOYALTY.

860
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,701
>> IF THE PEOPLE THEY BELIEVE

861
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,744
ARE GOING TO VOTE WITH ME ARE

862
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,037
REALLY NOT GOING TO VOTE WITH

863
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,706
ME, IF ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN

864
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,331
SMOKE, THEN I'M A TERRIBLE JUDGE

865
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,749
OF CHARACTER.

866
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,042
AND THEN I DON'T REALLY DESERVE

867
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,210
TO STAY IN THE GAME.

868
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,130
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT SKUPIN AND

869
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,799
R.C. AND DENISE AND CARTER AND

870
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,925
JEFF, THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE WITH

871
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:26,217
ME.

872
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:26,968
THEY ALL MEAN IT.

873
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,054
I REALLY BELIEVE THEY DO.

874
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,097
LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S

875
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,056
GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT.

876
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,892
BUT IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN

877
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,645
FLIP THIS VOTE, AND WE ARE THE

878
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,899
LAST PEOPLE STANDING THE FOUR

879
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,443
TIGHT KALABAW PEOPLE AND THE TWO

880
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,153
PEOPLE WE BROUGHT, IN WE CAN

881
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:45,737
TAKE CONTROL.

882
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,654
YOU KNOW?

883
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:51,075
THAT'S HOW I SEE IT.

884
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,201
WE'RE GOOD, OKAY.

885
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:57,206
WE REALLY ARE GOOD.

886
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,255
>> WE'RE GOOD.

887
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,465
WE'RE STILL HANGING.

888
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,259
>> YEAH.

889
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,344
>> YOU DOING IT?

890
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,179
>> WE'RE STILL HANGING.

891
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:11,346
YEAH.

892
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,805
WE WANT THESE VETERANS OUT OF

893
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,014
HERE.

894
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,724
>> I'M NERVOUS HERE.

895
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,267
>> WE'RE ALL NERVOUS HERE ON

896
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,186
THIS THING.

897
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,856
RIGHT NOW, I'M ON A CROSSROADS.

898
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,274
I'M EITHER GOING WITH VETERAN

899
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,318
PLAYERS THAT I DON'T WANT TO WIN

900
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,194
THIS GAME AND RIDE THEM OUT, OR

901
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,905
I'M GOING TO GO WITH THE TANDANG

902
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,073
TRIBE AND GET PEN ERP OUT OF

903
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,616
HERE, BUT THEN I'M ON THE

904
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:31,866
BOTTOM.

905
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,661
IF YOU TREAT BASEBALL WITH

906
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,287
DISRESPECT, YOU'LL BE BIT IN THE

907
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,247
ASS, AND I KNOW YOU TREAT THIS

908
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,750
GAME WITH DISRESPECT, YOU'LL GET

909
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,168
BIT IN THE ASS TOO.

910
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,127
WITH ALL HUMBLENESS, I SAY THE

911
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,129
DECISION OF WHO GOES HOME

912
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,881
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE HEAVILY

913
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,884
BASED ON WHICH WAY I GO AND WHO

914
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,761
I CARRY OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.

915
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,179
I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE I PROTECT

916
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,681
MYSELF BECAUSE WHATEVER MOVE I

917
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,516
MAKE, IT'S NOT GOING TO SIT WELL

918
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,853
WITH EITHER TRIBE.

919
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,491
>> Jeff: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO

920
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,159
DON'T HAVE A TORCH.

921
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,204
GO AHEAD AND GRAB ONE, APPROACH

922
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,873
THE FLAME, DIP IT IN AND GET

923
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,082
FIRE.

924
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,083
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

925
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,460
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

926
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,380
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

927
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,172
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE

928
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,173
YOU.

929
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,216
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO

930
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,884
SOMEBODY TONIGHT.

931
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,636
SO, WE'RE MAKING HISTORY.

932
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,347
THE ORIGINAL TANDANG SIX NEVER

933
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:36,848
LOST.

934
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,099
AND IN 25 SEASONS WE HAVE NEVER

935
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,059
HAD A TRIBE NOT GO TO TRIBAL

936
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,479
COUNCIL UNTIL THEY REACHED THE

937
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:43,688
MERGE.

938
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,023
ON THE FLIP SIDE, DENISE, YOU'VE

939
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,734
BEEN TO EVERY SINGLE TRIBAL

940
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,026
COUNCIL SINCE THE GAME STARTED.

941
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,153
>> EVERY ONE.

942
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,029
>> Jeff: AND WHAT'S AMAZING IS

943
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:52,405
YOU'VE SURVIVED.

944
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:56,993
>> I SOMEHOW SURVIVED IT ONE

945
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,244
MORE TIME.

946
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:58,786
I'M SAFE.

947
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,288
>> Jeff: SKUPIN, 19 DAYS IN

948
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,205
THERE HAS TO BE SOME ANIMOSITY

949
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,874
WITHIN TANDANG.

950
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,834
>> TRUE.

951
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,627
LITTLE FRACT STARTED TO OCCUR

952
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,920
BUT IT'S KIND OF NATURAL TO

953
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:08,546
HAPPEN WHEN SIX OR SEVEN PEOPLE

954
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,088
GET TOGETHER.

955
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,632
YET, WE STILL PULLED OUT

956
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:11,883
VICTORIES.

957
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,677
>> Jeff: R.C., HOW BAD HAS IT

958
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,386
GOTTEN AT CAMP?

959
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,346
>> IT WAS PRETTY BAD AT TANDANG.

960
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,015
BUT WE'RE A FAMILY.

961
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:19,557
FAMILIES FIGHT SOMETIMES.

962
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,309
>> Jeff: ABI, THERE'S ONLY ONE

963
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,602
WINNER.

964
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,103
FAMILIES DON'T WIN SURVIVE.

965
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:24,937
>> RIGHT.

966
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,647
AND THE GAME HAS BEEN SHIFTING

967
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:26,939
CONSTANTLY.

968
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,733
I WAS VERY CLOSE TO R.C. IN THE

969
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:28,983
BEGINNING.

970
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,110
HOWEVER, SHE BETRAYED ME.

971
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,446
SO I HAD TO MOVE ON TO A

972
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:33,863
DIFFERENT ALLIANCE.

973
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,240
>> I AM GLAD THIS FINALLY CAME

974
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,159
UP BECAUSE I'M STILL UNAWARE OF

975
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,577
HOW I BETRAYED HER.

976
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,620
>> Jeff: WHAT HAPPENED, ABI?

977
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,497
>> WE FOUND THE CLUE FOR THE

978
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,289
IMMUNITY IDOL TOGETHER, AND HID

979
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,834
THE CLUE TOGETHER.

980
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,711
HOWEVER, SHE UNBURIED THE CLUE

981
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,337
WITHOUT TELLING ME, SO I CAN'T

982
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,588
TRUST HER.

983
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,715
>> I DIDN'T UNBURY ANYTHING.

984
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,217
I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

985
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,177
>> I MEAN, IT WASN'T ME.

986
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,845
>> IT WASN'T ME.

987
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,096
>> AND THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.

988
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,680
BUT YOU BLEW UP AND WOULDN'T

989
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,057
HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH ME.

990
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:06,979
>> I TRUST MY ACTIONS, NOT YOURS

991
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,481
>> Jeff: SO, LISA, WHEN YOU

992
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,858
HEAR TWO TRIBE MATES FROM THE

993
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,693
ORIGINAL TANDANG SIX ARGUING,

994
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,695
CONCERN YOU AT ALL THAT SOMEBODY

995
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,364
FROM KALABAW MIGHT COME OVER AND

996
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,156
SAY, "LETCH.

997
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,908
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM

998
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:19,075
IS.

999
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,160
COME OVER HERE AND WE HAVE FIVE

1000
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,286
AND WE CONTROL THIS GAME."

1001
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,663
>> IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

1002
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,957
WHOLE 11 PEOPLE, THEN THEY WERE

1003
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,542
TOP DOG HERE STAYING WITH

1004
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,001
TANDANG THAN GOING TO KALABAW.

1005
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,336
AND THEN JUST GETTING VOTED OFF

1006
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,380
AT THE END THERE.

1007
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,589
>> Jeff: JEFF, WHAT'S WRONG

1008
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,590
WITH LISA'S ARGUMENT?

1009
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,216
>> THERE'S A TRIBE THAT COMES IN

1010
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,845
WITH FOUR, AND IS OFFERING A

1011
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,513
FIVE SLOT VERSUS A SIX OR A

1012
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,057
SEVEN SLOT, THERE'S POTENTIAL

1013
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,935
FOR A GAME--CHANGING SWITCH.

1014
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:46,561
>> BUT ONCE YOU FLIP, YOU'RE NOT

1015
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,688
REALLY A STRONG NUMBER.

1016
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,107
YOU'RE A WEAKER NUMBER BECAUSE

1017
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,732
YOU'VE SHOWN THAT YOU CAN'T BE

1018
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,319
TRUSTED IN YOUR ALLIANCE.

1019
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,488
>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT

1020
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:57,905
RETURNING PLAYERS.

1021
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,407
TWO OF THEM ARE STILL IN THE

1022
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,199
GAME, SKUPIN AND PENNER.

1023
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,325
PETE, IS THERE A GROUP THOUGHT

1024
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:05,371
IN TERMS OF YOU HAD YOUR SHOT?

1025
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:05,913
GET OUT?

1026
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,748
>> I MEAN, EVERY SEASON WHERE

1027
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,916
THEY RETURN PLAYERS, USUALLY

1028
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,959
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT

1029
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:10,334
THEY'RE HERE.

1030
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,628
I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT TO PLAY THE

1031
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,296
GAME BEFORE.

1032
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,422
SO THERE'S ALWAYS A KIND OF

1033
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,090
MUTINY FEELING.

1034
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:18,009
BUT TANDANG HAS NEVER HAD TO GO

1035
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:18,593
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL SO YOU NEVER

1036
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,178
REALLY KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE

1037
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:21,429
HAPPENED.

1038
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,015
>> Jeff: IT'S ALSO ANOTHER

1039
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,933
EXAMPLE WHY KALABAW IS LICKING

1040
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:26,350
THEIR CHOPS.

1041
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,561
R.C. COULD BE UP FOR GRAPS.

1042
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,396
YOU SKUPIN COULD BE UP FOR

1043
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:30,605
GRABS.

1044
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,566
AND LISA IS THERE ANY CONCERN

1045
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,234
MALCOLM AND DENISE STARTED THE

1046
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,152
GAME TOGETHER.

1047
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,528
THEY'RE BOTH STILL HERE AND NOW

1048
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:37,987
THEY'RE BACK TOGETHER?

1049
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,696
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1050
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,238
IT'S A HUGE CONCERN AND IT

1051
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,909
BRICKS UP SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T

1052
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:43,159
ADDRESSED.

1053
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,078
THERE'S ALSO EVERY POSSIBILITY

1054
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,371
THAT SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE

1055
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,915
BOTTOM FLOOR IS THINKING IF I

1056
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,833
COME OVER TO TANDANG, MAYBE I

1057
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,001
CAN STAY A LITTLE LONGER.

1058
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,170
I WON'T BE TOP DOG BUT AT LEAST

1059
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,713
I WON'T BE THE DOG KICKED TO THE

1060
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,256
SIDE OF THE ROAD SO THERE IS

1061
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,008
ALSO THAT POSSIBILITY THAT COULD

1062
00:36:59,091 --> 00:36:59,383
BE HAPPENING.

1063
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,969
>> Jeff: SO, PETE, WHAT'S THE

1064
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,387
CONSENSUS ON THE IDOLS?

1065
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,056
HOW MANY MIGHT THERE BE IN PLAY

1066
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:05,306
TONIGHT?

1067
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:05,932
>> I THINK THERE WERE TWO IN THE

1068
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,683
GAME RIGHT NOW.

1069
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,687
I'M PRETTY SURE MASTING'S IS

1070
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:11,979
GONE.

1071
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:12,647
>> Jeff: PETE, CONCERNED IT

1072
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,190
COULD BE YOU TONIGHT?

1073
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,942
CLEARLY, ARE YOU ONE OF THE FIT,

1074
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,401
YOUNG GUYS WHO COULD DO WELL IN

1075
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:17,693
CHALLENGES?

1076
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,321
>> RIGHT, I FEEL I HAVE A HUGE

1077
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:20,696
TARGET ON MY BACK.

1078
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,448
>> Jeff: ABI, IS THAT

1079
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,532
JUSTIFIED FOR PETE TO BE

1080
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:23,824
CONCERNED?

1081
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,408
>> ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.

1082
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,994
>> Jeff: YEF JEFF, HOW LIKELY

1083
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,496
IS IT THAT THERE WILL BE A

1084
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:28,871
BLINDSIDE TONIGHT?

1085
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,498
>> VERY LIKELY.

1086
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,916
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO US FAIR

1087
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:32,166
WHILE NOW.

1088
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,335
YOU GET THE FACT WE'RE ALL

1089
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,628
SCRAMBLING STILL AS WE SIT HERE

1090
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:40,633
NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHO'S GOING

1091
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:40,841
HOME.

1092
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,592
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELL,

1093
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,886
CLEARLY, THERE IS A LOT OF

1094
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,929
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT IS GOING

1095
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,429
TO HAPPEN.

1096
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,264
LET'S TRY TO BRING SOME CLARITY.

1097
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,183
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1098
00:37:49,266 --> 00:38:05,950
ABI, YOU'RE UP

1099
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:37,356
>> I NEVER LIKED YOU.

1100
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,244
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1101
00:38:50,327 --> 00:39:00,504
VOTES.

1102
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,218
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS THE

1103
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,094
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

1104
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,554
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE

1105
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:15,394
THE TIME TO DO SO

1106
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:24,445
>> I'LL DO IT.

1107
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,446
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

1108
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:30,910
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

1109
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,661
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN

1110
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:32,995
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1111
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,955
ANY VOTES CAST AGAINST PENNER

1112
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,456
WILL NOT COUNT.

1183
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,037

00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,955
VERY PROUD OF MYSELF.
