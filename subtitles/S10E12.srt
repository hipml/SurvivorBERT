00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,170
on<i> Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,297
>> What the hell was that?

4
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,841
>> PROBST: After Janu shocked

5
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,259
her tribe by quitting the game,

6
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,136
Koror's plan to oust Stephenie

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,137
was out in the open.

8
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,138
>> STEPHENIE: I don't know who

9
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,139
to trust.

10
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,098
I don't know who to talk to.

11
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,099
I almost don't want to talk

12
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:16,391
to anybody.

13
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,434
>> PROBST: But Stephenie's

14
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,143
presence in the game put

15
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:18,518
the men on edge.

16
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,437
>> Stephenie progressing

17
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,438
in this game means that Koror

18
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,313
falls apart.

19
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,481
>> PROBST: Tom was also feeling

20
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,107
vulnerable.

21
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,108
>> I'm pleading for my life.

22
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,402
My strength in the challenges,

23
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,320
it's part of what got us to

24
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,071
this point.

25
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,781
>> PROBST: But the women saw

26
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,074
an opportunity and a plan

27
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,702
was hatched.

28
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,703
>> I think it's an awesome idea.

29
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,704
>> Who would be the first one

30
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,706
you'd want off?

31
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,707
>> You want to think I'm

32
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,708
a threat?

33
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,709
I'll show you how threatening

34
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,710
I am.

35
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,003
>> PROBST: Before the immunity

36
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,005
challenge, Tom turned to Caryn.

37
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,298
>> I think that we do have some

38
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,841
kind of a sympathetic thing

39
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:50,383
going where we're going to

40
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,385
look out for each other.

41
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,803
It was a good move on my part

42
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,345
to be friends with Caryn.

43
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,140
>> PROBST: At the immunity

44
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,768
challenge, the pressure was on.

45
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,769
There are five tiles for

46
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,603
each of you.

47
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,521
First person to break all five

48
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,398
of their tiles wins immunity.

49
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,483
But Ian was handed victory

50
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,319
when Tom took out his last tile.

51
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,196
Ian wins immunity.

52
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,615
>> Thank you, guys.

53
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,199
>> PROBST: Back at camp,

54
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,826
Katie approached Caryn about

55
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,368
the women's alliance.

56
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,163
Stick with the women

57
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,122
and take out the men?

58
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,290
>> PROBST: Caryn leaked the

59
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,291
information.

60
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,751
>> What do the girls think?

61
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,544
>> Trying to figure out

62
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,670
which side to take out.

63
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,217
>> PROBST: So Ian confronted

64
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,218
Katie when he learned of

65
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,219
her plan.

66
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,220
>> Caryn is spreading that

67
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,179
you're trying to get all the

68
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,180
girls against the guys.

69
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,181
>> I just hate for it to be such

70
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,182
a sweep and Tom just takes

71
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,183
the whole thing and none of

72
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,184
us have a chance.

73
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,185
>> PROBST: All hope for the

74
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,186
women's alliance was crushed...

75
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,187
It's already been too much

76
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,188
of the Stephenie show.

77
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,189
Stephenie needs to go.

78
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,190
Too much of the Stephenie show.

79
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,191
Stephenie needs to go.

80
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,192
>> PROBST: But Steph still clung

81
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,193
to hope.

82
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,194
>> I've said my piece,

83
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,195
I planted my seed.

84
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,196
If they're smart, Tom will be

85
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,197
the next one to go.

86
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,490
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

87
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,617
although Caryn received one

88
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,786
vote, Koror stuck together.

89
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,787
The third member of our jury,

90
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,496
Steph.

91
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,122
And Stephenie, the only

92
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,499
remaining Ulong member,

93
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,251
was finally voted out.

94
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,128
The tribe has spoken.

95
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,421
Six are left.

96
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,508
Who will be voted out tonight?

97
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,807

>> Poor girl.

101
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,015
Did you see her face?

102
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,642
She was probably stressing out.

103
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,143

00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,898
I thought that it could

108

have been me last night.

109
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,150
I wouldn't blame them.

110
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:54,692
If I was playing against me,

111
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,736
I'd want me out of here, too,

112
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,446
but they didn't do it;

113
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,864
it was a relief.

114
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,448
They're holding true to the

115
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,325
five, and would I like to

116
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,952
believe that it will continue

117
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,037

different things.

123
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,422
I'm up all night running

124

She's more nervous than a long-

tailed cat in a roomful of

rocking chairs, at this point.

131

of an alliance of five,

133
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,980
so she feels she's next.

134
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,440
I can't step out from five to

135
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,609
side with one right now.

136
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,485

137
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,529

138

is pull your own savior;

139
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,241
your salvation.

against the five people that he

145
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,344
had the alliance with, so...

the ability, and that's what

176
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,519
we're gonna today do.

For today's reward challenge,

183
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,958
I'm going to ask you a series

184

of questions about Palau and

185
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,127
Micronesia.

186
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,129
Every time you answer a question

187
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,173
correctly, you earn the right to

188
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,800
drop another tribe member's

189
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,634
torch closer to the water.

190
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,053
After three drops on any one

191
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,763
tribe member's flame, that flame

192
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,597
goes in the water; they're out

193
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,556
of the challenge.

194
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,309
Last person left standing,

195
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,102
wins reward.

196
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,103
Want to know what you're

197
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:35,394
playing for?

198
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:35,686
>> Oh, yeah.

199
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:35,937
>> Yeah.

200
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,063
>> Yes.

201
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,522
(horn blowing)

202
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,273
>> Look at that.

203
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,358
>> Oh, my God.

204
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:40,775
>> Double-decker.

205
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,236
>> Oh, yeah.

206
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,904
>> For your reward, you will

207
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,572
board a luxury yacht, you'll

208
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,490
get a fresh shower, then you

209
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,117
will feast.

210
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,992
You'll spend the night

211
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,993
on the yacht.

212
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,286
You will return to your beach

213
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:52,703
tomorrow-- hopefully

214
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,956
rejuvenated, re-energized,

215
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,582
to get you through these last

216
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,291
few days.

217
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:57,750
Make sense?

218
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,626
>> Yeah.

219
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,710
>> PROBST: Take a spot.

220
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,796
Let's go.

221
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,633
All right, pick up the cubes;

222
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,092
we'll get started.

223
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,636
First question:

224
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,721
"Palau is famous for its green,

226
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,017
"known as: A) Stone islands,

or C) Mushroom islands."

229

Correct answer is:

230
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,150
"B) Rock islands."

231
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,359
Everybody got it right.

232
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,402
Tom, you're up first.

233
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,403
>> Oh, no.

234
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,487
I didn't want to be first to

235
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,573
start this nastiness.

236
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,661
>> PROBST: Gregg takes the first

>> We'll even it out.

239
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,665
(chuckles)

240
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:41,252
>> PROBST: Jenn, you're up.

241

Caryn takes her first hit.

243
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,679

(weak laugh)

246

Every reward we get, Caryn gets

250
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,357
all the food.

251
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,109
Caryn, you get to pay somebody

252
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:05,943
back right now.

253
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,279
Heading over to Katie.

Katie takes her first hit.

Gregg.

256
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,700
>> Tom.

257

>> PROBST: A little payback?

258
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,161
>> Little payback, that's it.

259

>> Surprise, surprise, surprise.

265
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,505
You also got a cheeseburger,

266

Caryn.

267
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,342
>> PROBST: Wow. Just like that.

268
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,509
>> Let's try to still be nice.

269
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,552
> PROBST: Caryn's out in the

270
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,762
first round and not happy.

271

Next question:

272
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,639
"In the early days of Palau,

273
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,640
stone was used as a form

274
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,892
of money.

275
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,062
The largest stone weighed up to:

276
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,980
"A) Five pounds;

or D) 10,000 pounds."

00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,695
Correct answer is:

280
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,322
"D) 10,000 pounds."

281
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,031
>> Damn.

282
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,449
>> "Five tons."

283
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,575
Tom is the only one who got it

284
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,576
right.

285
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,286
Make your move.

286
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:57,870
>> Keep with an all-boy theme

287
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,789
on this one, and, uh...

288
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,748
>> No, don't do that.

289
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,709
>> I'm sorry, my friend.

Next question:

293
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,589
"The islands of Palau are

294
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,676

Tom, you're up.

305

out.

315
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,787
Ian could put Tom out of this

challenge right now.

The correct answer is...

00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,126
You'll never live it down, ever.

383
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:09,960
>> PROBST: Wait, Gregg.

384
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,211
>> Yeah.

385
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:10,920
Did you just ask permission?

386
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,963
>> Yes, he did.

387
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:13,214
>> Wow.

388
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,340
>> Is it okay, dear?

389
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,174
>> What a...

390
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,258
>> Gregg, be a man.

391
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,176
>> Don't do it, Gregg.

392
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,010
>> I can't believe you're doing

393
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:18,803
that.

394
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,762
>> You said, "I'll save you."

395
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,763
>> If you hit me, she's going

396
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,640
to hit me, too, I'll be out.

397
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,016
>> PROBST: Wow.

398
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,059
>> You suck, Gregg.

399
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,477
>> PROBST: Gregg hits Katie.

400
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,188
Katie comes back and hits Gregg,

401
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,773
and no smile on that face.

402
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,109
Interesting how that works.

403
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,402
Jenn is now in the lead.

404
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,404
Gregg and Katie down to their

405
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,029
last drop.

406
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:37,947
Jenn still has two hits.

407
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,490
True or false...

408
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,450
"Palau was the first nation in

409
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,285
the world to issue the Elvis

410
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,498
Presley postage stamp."

411
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,667
Correct answer is true.

412
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,501
Gregg got it right,

413
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,335
Jenn got it right.

414
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,503
Katie got it wrong.

415
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,504
Jenn, you're up.

416
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,547
>> Sorry, Katie.

417
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,548
>> Don't.

418
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,467
>> I'm sorry.

419
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,261
>> PROBST: Katie is out of the

420
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,637
competition, takes a seat on

421
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,721
the bench.

422
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,267
Gregg's only choice is Jenn.

423
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,977
>> At least he didn't ask.

424
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,228
>> PROBST: You both have one hit

425
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,229
left.

426
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:10,938
One person gets it right, and

427
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,982
the other person gets it wrong,

428
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,024
that's it.

429
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,068
"The coconut crabs which inhabit

430
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,903
the islands of Palau have the

431
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,947
special ability to do what after

432
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,698
they eat?

433
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,116
"A) change color;

434
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,410
B) leap up to three feet;

435
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,413
or C) replicate themselves?"

436
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,542
For reward, make your choice.

437
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,501
Jenn says B.

438
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,711
>> That is wrong.

439
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,462
>> Damn.

440
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,131
>> PROBST: Gregg says "A) change

441
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,257
That is right.

442
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,258
Gregg, make your final hit.

443
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,718
Gregg has no choice.

444
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,552
>> Oh, damn.

445
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,303
>> Sorry, Jenn.

446
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,013
>> PROBST: Takes Jenn, puts her

447
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,014
out of the challenge.

448
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:45,389
Gregg wins reward.

449
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,640
>> Sorry.

450
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,267
>> Good job, Gregg.

451
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,810
>> PROBST: Yacht, shower...

452
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,811
>> Sorry.

453
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,812
>> PROBST: ...massage,

454
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,689
big feast.

455
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,690
Obviously it wouldn't be much

456
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,649
fun alone.

457
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,400
>> Oh!

458
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,486
So pick one person to join you.

459
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,074
>> Sorry, guys.

460
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,367
Jenn, let's go.

461
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:05,534
>> Oh!

462
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,412
Thank you.

463
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,498
>> Ooh...

464
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,417
>> PROBST: I'm sure you guys

465
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,835
will have a good time together.

466
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,920
And two is very fun, but three

467
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:16,921
is a party.

468
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:17,963
Pick one more person.

469
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,048
>> Oh, God!

470
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,090
>> Oh!

471
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,425
>> Sorry, man.

472
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:22,468
>> Katie.

473
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,263
(cheering)

474
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,265
>> You are forgiven.

475
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,975
>> Hey, guys, I'm so sorry.

476
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:30,309
I will, uh...

477
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,852
I will pay you back.

478
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,771
>> Oh, no, we'll pay you back.

479
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,314
(laughing)

480
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,732
>> PROBST: Tom, Ian, Caryn, head

481
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,983
on back to camp.

482
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,984
All right, guys, your yacht is

483
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,528
waiting.

484
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,987
Have a good night.

485
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,836
That's the icing on the cake.

486
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,837
We didn't come here for the

487
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,421
icing.

488
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,714
We came for the cake.

489
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,632
Let's go talk.

490
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,716
I have an idea.

491
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,175
>> You do?

492
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:03,425
>> Yeah.

493
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,510
>> Really?

494
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:04,760
>> Yeah.

495
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,594
>> I'm serious about it, yeah.

496
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,304
>> Today at the challenge, Katie

497
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,931
chose to throw me into the water

498
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,683
rather than Gregg, and I said,

499
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,225
"Wow, that's interesting.

500
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,227
If Katie is willing to sell me

501
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,603
out for a night on the yacht,

502
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,187
there's no way she's going to

503
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,105
hold on to me for a million

504
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,856
dollars."

505
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,857
We have a couple choices to

506
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,275
make.

507
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,110
>> Okay, go.

508
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,069
>> The way that I see it right

509
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,655
now, we have lost control of

510
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,072
the game.

511
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,156
>> Why?

512
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,657
>> We're not making the

513
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,825
decisions.

514
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,118
Gregg and Jenn are.

515
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:29,660
>> Why, 'cause they won one

516
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:29,952
challenge?

517
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,704
>> No, uh-uh.

518
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,329
I think that they got Katie, and

519
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,039
one of the three of us out.

520
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,124
Me, Tom, you.

521
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,459
>> Mm-hmm.

522
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,502
>> I think it goes in that

523
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,378
order.

524
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,379
I know they're ready to turn

525
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,213
on you.

526
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,131
I know for a fact.

527
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,007
>> And you think Katie is in

528
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,592
with that?

529
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,593
>> Yeah, I think she is.

530
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,261
>> Caryn warned me that Katie

531
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,971
was looking to get rid of me,

532
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,972
but I still wasn't willing to

533
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,973
take her word over Katie's at

534
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,350
that point.

535
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,394
Now, Ian says Katie, she's now

536
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,313
become the shady lady Katie,

537
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,147
looking to dump us and go into

538
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,148
the final with Gregg and Jenn.

539
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,149
>> I think Gregg is a dark horse

540
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,150
right now.

541
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,151
>> Yeah.

542
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,152
>> Nobody would vote against him

543
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,153
in the final two.

544
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,154
>> Nobody. Especially...

545
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,155
>> Why?

546
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,156
>> He's never made any enemies.

547
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,073
>> He hasn't pissed anybody off,

548
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,950
he's very affable.

549
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,035
He works hard.

550
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:15,205
>> What do you think?

551
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:15,956
>> We go for Gregg tomorrow

552
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,083
night.

553
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,127
>> Do we?

554
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,047
>> We'd tie, wouldn't we?

555
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,131
>> Yeah.

556
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,382
Three would go against me,

557
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,383
and three would go against

558
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,092
Gregg.

559
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,177
What more do you propose?

560
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,972
>> I don't know what the next

561
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:32,181
step is.

562
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,933
>> Suddenly, the sequence of

563
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,935
events have fallen into place

564
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,812
that have really benefited me.

565
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,023
Those five had an alliance,

566
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,358
and, lucky for me, that alliance

567
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,192
is breaking down now.

568
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,235
I'm not sure exactly what's

569
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,528
going to happen.

570
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,112
The only thing I can do is

571
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,239
to keep close to Tom and Ian.

572
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,115
That's all I can do.

573
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,368
That's my only hope.

574
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,209
>> Gregg, you got to go on

575
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,794
first.

576
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,711
>> This is awesome.

577
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,712
>> Oh, my God.

578
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,339
>> We get to the boat and

579
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,633
Captain Mike greets us and lets

580
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,718
us know this is a day of being

581
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,303
pampered, VIP treatment.

582
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,096
>> Rooms one and two.

583
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,848
>> Oh, my gosh.

584
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,474
>> He shows us to the bunks and

585
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,142
when we walked in we found

586
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,310
our bathing suits which we

587
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,436
haven't seen since we left

588
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,020
for the island.

589
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,021
(shouting)

590
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,024
We were so excited to get on

591
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,609
to the next event.

592
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,277
So we quickly scrubbed up, threw

593
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,278
the bathrobe on and then we went

594
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,280
up to the deck for full-body

595
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,031
massages.

596
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,200
It felt like finally I was on

597
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,743
vacation in Palau.

598
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,377
(whispers indistinctly)

599
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,881
That feels great.

600
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,800
This is unbelievable.

601
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,844
I'm sitting there loving it,

602
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,303
just relaxing, and then I

603
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,264
noticed the hands feel a little

604
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,349
colder, feel a little different.

605
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,226
Next thing I know I get a hard

606
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,688
smack on the ass, and I do a

607
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,814
double take.

608
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,107
My eyes have been closed,

609
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,525
I've been daydreaming.

610
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,860
And my best friend from home,

611
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,111
Greg, is staring at me, and he's

612
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:09,945
like what's up?

613
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:10,446
>> Looking fine, dude.

614
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,071
>> Doing well, man.

615
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,073
>> Yeah, hell, yeah.

616
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,074
>> We were both in disbelief.

617
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,159
>> It was nuts.

618
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:15,743
We didn't know how to react.

619
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,118
>> Cheers.

620
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,911
>> I don't even know where

621
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:18,454
to begin.

622
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,204
>> Cheers.

623
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,539
>> Oh, my God, what's this?

624
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,999
What?!

625
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,584
Oh, my God.

626
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,293
>> Shrimp and...

627
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,294
>> What is this?

628
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,086
>> Dig in, man.

629
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,963
>> This is an onion ring.

630
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,964
>> This is beautiful.

631
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,840
>> Calamari.

632
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,424
>> This is, by far, the best

633
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,050
reward challenge,

634
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,261
I mean, obviously.

635
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,262
>> Oh, my God!

636
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,389
>> Oh, my God!

637
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,854
>> You got... you got all the

638
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,899
stuff?

639
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,900
>> All of a sudden, I get a tap

640
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:48,901
on my shoulder, and it's my

641
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,902
sister Kim.

642
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,903
All I could do was bawl, like

643
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:51,737
cry.

644
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,738
That's all I could do.

645
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,739
I was just like, oh, my God.

646
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,198
She's here!

647
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,910
>> We're going to have a party!

648
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,286
>> Stan is my sister's husband.

649
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,872
He is the brother I never had.

650
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,290
My sister just had a baby,

651
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,083
so she wasn't able to come,

652
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,418
so it was the next-best thing

653
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,377
to having my sister.

654
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,379
I couldn't ask for a better

655
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,130
reward.

656
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,674
>> It was the most phenomenal

657
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:27,731
experience of my lifetime.

658
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,732
>> Now they're doing it.

659
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,733
>> But you're sure that she's

660
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,734
ready to go against me with

661
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,860
them?

662
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,861
>> Yep.

663
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,362
>> Mm-hmm, I know that.

664
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,406
>> So Gregg should go tomorrow?

665
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,580
>> Mm-hmm.

666
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,581
>> It would be very easy

667
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,332
in a tie situation.

668
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,583
You put Gregg and Caryn up

669
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,751
against the wall.

670
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,961
>> And so we need to break this

671
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,962
tie.

672
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:50,546
>> Katie is forced to switch

673
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,798
her vote, because she knows that

674
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,799
if she doesn't, she has to pick

675
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,800
a rock.

676
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,801
>> Right.

677
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,969
>> The way the rules are, if

678
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,470
there is a tie at Tribal

679
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,472
Council, both members who were

680
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,558
voted on, those two will become

681
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,476
safe and it comes down to the

682
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,561
rest of us, reaching in a bag,

683
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,397
pulling out a colored stone.

684
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,190
Whoever gets the purple stone

685
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,984
is going home that night.

686
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,985
That's a calculated risk

687
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:13,986
on our part.

688
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,028
>> Maybe she picks the rock and

689
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,196
then we have to pick a rock

690
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,281
to see who goes home.

691
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,323
It sucks, but I can go to Tribal

692
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,742
Council willing to take the

693
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,785
rock, you know what I mean?

694
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,786
Like, I'm willing to make

695
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,787
that gamble.

696
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,122
I came to play a game.

697
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,290
>> That's the plan.

698
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,458
>> You and I are both willing

699
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:28,834
to choose rocks.

700
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,460
>> And we should be.

701
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,840
>> That's right.

702
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,049
Let's do this.

703
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,134
>> Desperate times call for

704
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:37,676
desperate measures, right?

705
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,387
>> We have a plan.

706
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,597
>> Tom and I have decided that

707
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,639
we're going to force a tie

708
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,016
at Tribal Council.

709
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,434
We've prepared ourselves for the

710
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,810
idea that we might be going

711
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,686
home, but this is a risk we

712
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,687
had to take.

713
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,688
>> It's a gamble.

714
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,272
Hopefully, Katie realizes that

715
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,649
she doesn't want to pick a rock.

716
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,026
She wants to stay in the game.

717
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,110
This is the biggest step that

718
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,111
you and I have to get to the

719
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,029
final three.

720
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,030
That's why it's important that

721
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:58,780
he does not see it coming.

722
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,532
Any leaks and we're done.

723
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,950
The game's over for us.

724
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:02,534
It's a delicate operation that

725
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,077
needs to be handled with the

726
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,120
utmost of care.

727
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,496
It's kind of like taking a bag

728
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,206
of potato chips from a fat man.

729
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,207
You can do it, but you'd better

730
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,083
do it quick.

731
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,084
Otherwise, he'll turn around

732
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:11,960
and sit on you.

733
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,086
>> You've been acting the last

734
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,087
two days like you're about to

735
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,172
be sent home.

736
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:15,881
>> Uh-huh.

737
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:16,465
>> Continue to act that way.

738
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,133
>> Okay.

739
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,051
>> Do not say a word...

740
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,802
> Don't be chipper.

741
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,553
Be down and dour.

742
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,054
>> Okay.

743
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:22,512
>> Okay.

744
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,221
>> Okay?

745
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:23,597
>> Yep.

746
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,015
I can do it.

747
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:25,349
I'm psyched.

748
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,225
I'm totally psyched.

749
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,393
This is really working out well.

750
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,394
I think we can pull this off,

751
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,104
I really do.

752
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:31,980
Because you know what?

753
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,981
I'm a very good actress,

754
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,067
very, very good.

755
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,657
>> This is so gorgeous.

756
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,327
We're on a boat going to this

757
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,204
lagoon.

758
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,705
We're just thinking snorkeling,

759
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,498
we have no idea.

760
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,083
>> I don't know.

761
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,501
>> Oh, my gosh, there's

762
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,502
dolphins!

763
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,837
>> All of a sudden, all of us

764
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,131
see these fins that are just

765
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,342
swimming through the water and

766
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,343
we're like oh, my God, no way,

767
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:09,851
no way!

768
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:14,648
>> Hi.

769
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,525
>> Hi.

770
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,069
>> Oh, my gosh.

771
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,320
>> Swimming with the dolphins

772
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,323
was, by far, the most magical

773
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,992
moment I've ever had.

774
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:25,993
It was something I've always

775
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:26,576
wanted to do.

776
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,578
I mean, it's like my dream.

777
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:28,954
>> Hi!

778
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:29,371
>> Oh, this is...

779
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:29,955
>> Oh!

780
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,748
>> I'm so happy.

781
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,833
>> It was the most surreal

782
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,875
experience I've ever had,

783
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,127
and to be able to share that

784
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,169
with my sister was just

785
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,170
incredible.

786
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,338
I kept going, "I can't believe

787
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,799
you're here for this."

788
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,383
It's just the experience of

789
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,677
a lifetime, and she got to

790
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,636
share it with me.

791
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,513
I never wanted it to end.

792
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,598
It was unbelievable.

793
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,523
>> Cheers. I can't reach.

794
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,026
>> After the day of snorkeling,

795
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,527
and hanging with the dolphins,

796
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,820
we were able to do a little

797
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:02,404
strategy talk.

798
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,822
This was our opportunity

799
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,823
to confirm that, hey, guys,

800
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,824
it's us three to the final

801
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,826
three.

802
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,535
We happen to have a good bond,

803
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,121
and it just also benefits

804
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:11,705
the three of us to go to

805
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,790
the final three.

806
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,840
>> I came into this knowing that

807
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:22,424
I might have to jump ship, if

808
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,425
it comes down to it.

809
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,677
My strategy is to stick with

810
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,054
those people that make the

811
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,430
decisions until those people no

812
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,431
longer have any power, and then

813
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,432
jump to the next person that

814
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,517
makes the decision.

815
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:43,570
>> Yeah.

816
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,031
>> We all realize the threats

817
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,699
that Ian and Tom are, so it was

818
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,617
good to get agreement with that.

819
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,618
It felt real.

820
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,744
It felt true.

821
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,079
And I believe that that bond

822
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,164
is-is tight till the end.

823
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,466
>> I hear a boat.

824
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,550
>> I think it's them.

825
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,927
>> Oh, yeah.

826
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,594
>> Here we go, guys.

827
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,097
>> Let's do this right.

828
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,140
>> I'm sour and dour.

829
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,767
>> Hey, hey!

830
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,019
>> What's happening?

831
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:16,645
>> Who's that?

832
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,523
>> I don't know.

833
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,857
>> That's their families.

834
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,441
>> Oh, no.

835
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,317
>> Oh, no.

836
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,068
>> Oh, no.

837
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,069
>> Those are your families.

838
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,571
Today I think my worst fears

839
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,949
were, uh... realized.

840
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,951
Only three family members got

841
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,036
to spend time with their loved

842
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,080
ones, and the other three are

843
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,165
left on the beach to, uh, hear

844
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:37,999
the stories.

845
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,334
>> How you doing? I'm Tom.

846
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,087
>> This one cuts and twists,

847
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,838
and, uh, it's tough.

848
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,338
>> We're almost there.

849
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:43,588
>> I know.

850
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,340
>> We'll plow through.

851
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:45,882
>> Yeah.

852
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,175
>> Get-Get this thing done.

853
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,176
>> It'll get tough, you know,

854
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,177
when you guys get down to

855
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,137
picking people that you care

856
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,138
about off.

857
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:51,972
>> Sure.

858
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:52,973
>> Well, if there's one person

859
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:53,849
that, uh...

860
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,058
>> You've got somebody looking

861
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,226
out for her out here, it's me

862
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,018
looking out for her, so...

863
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:57,561
>> Good.

864
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:03,984
I appreciate that.

865
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,027
>> When my friend Greg had to

866
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,446
leave, it was just really tough.

867
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,824
>> Remember, we're all proud

868
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,284
of you at home.

869
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,285
>> You know, it was only a year

870
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,286
ago that my dad passed away,

871
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,287
and the grieving still happens

872
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,289
every day.

873
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:17,873
Just tell my mom that I love

874
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,875
her so much and I cannot wait

875
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,334
to just spend time with her

876
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,127
when I get back.

877
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,837
Will you tell her that?

878
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,087
>> I will.

879
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:30,886
>> Just tell her...

880
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,096
>> This might have been the last

881
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,389
love fest in camp.

882
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:34,973
>> Let's do a really cheesy...

883
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,767
(indistinct voices)

884
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,020
>> Now it's time to get control

885
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,272
of the game again, and focus on

886
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,357
the coming six days and what

887
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,234
needs to be accomplished.

888
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,569
It has been a good run, but it's

889
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,613
about to get a little rough.

890
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,656
That little trip that they took

891
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,742
may cost them big.

892
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,879
>> Tree mail.

893
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,050
>> What have we got?

894
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,718
>> "Some played hard, some

895
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,553
just watched and others just

896
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,387
skated by.

897
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,805
To make your chances one

898
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,973
in five, give this one your

899
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,266
best try.

900
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,768
"Usually this is a second

901
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,560
chance, but for some it's

902
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,479
all brand new.

903
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,189
So embrace the challenges of

904
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,107
the past, or tonight you could

905
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:26,816
be through."

906
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,817
>> What?

907
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,152
>> Wow.

908
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:29,778
>> In order for our plan to

909
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,571
work, a lot has to happen today.

910
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,740
Worst case scenario is Gregg

911
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,116
wins immunity, so we really

912
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,159
need to work hard today and

913
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,160
make sure that doesn't happen.

914
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,161
I didn't come to play for sixth

915
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,162
or fifth or fourth or third or

916
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,580
second.

917
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,581
I'm going to do my damndest

918
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,582
to make sure that I come across

919
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,668
the finish line first.

920
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,008
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

921
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,595
How's it going, everybody?

922
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,389
>> Hey, Jeff.

923
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:57,931
>> PROBST: Ready to get to

924
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:58,598
today's immunity challenge?

925
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,350
>> Yeah.

926
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,101
>> Yeah.

927
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,394
>> PROBST: First things first,

928
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,479
Ian... give it up.

929
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,943
Immunity once again back up

930
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:10,652
for grabs.

931
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,112
It is rare in this game

932
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:12,779
of<i> Survivor</i> that you get

933
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,613
a second chance.

934
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,116
Today's challenge provides just

935
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,534
that-- a second chance to

936
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,994
revisit some of the challenges

937
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,703
from the past.

938
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,204
It is a<i> Survivor</i>

939
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,831
elimination-style challenge.

940
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,791
All six of you will

941
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,167
race up the net maze.

942
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,044
The first five to finish will

943
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,171
move on to the next round, where

944
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,048
you will race to a symbol-- a

945
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,633
land version of the sea star

946
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,634
puzzle.

947
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,094
The first four to finish that

948
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,929
will move on to the next round,

949
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,764
where you will eat three balut,

Keep moving, Jenn.

1061
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,658
You're falling behind.

1062

00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,010
Ian, you're up first.

1073
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,513
First person to knock out

1074
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,473
three targets wins immunity.

1075
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,433
>> I'll go with blue.

1076
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,519

1077
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,022
Ian connects with his first

1078
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:58,273
target.

1079
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,108
He's up one-oh.

1080
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,068

1081
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,032

Ian leads one-oh.

1083
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,288
Ian looking to extend the lead.

1084
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,497
And he does.

1085
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,498
>> Wow.

1086
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,833
>> PROBST: Ian drills his second

1087
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,584
target.

1088
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,669
Tom needs to get on the board.

1089
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,963
Tom nicks it, doesn't break it.

1090
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,965
Tom, still not on the board.

1091
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,008
All Ian has to do is knock

1092
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,802
out his last blue target.

1093
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,930
And he does.

1094
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:31,598
>> Whoo!

1095
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,473
>> Wow.

1096
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,474
>> PROBST: Ian wins immunity.

1097
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,476

00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,060
>> PROBST: Ian, get over here.

1099
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,605
>> Thank you.

1100
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,814
>> PROBST: Nicely done.

1101
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:40,732
>> Thanks.

1102
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,816
> PROBST: Back-to-back

1103
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:42,317
challenges, safe tonight

1104
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,901
at Tribal Council.

1105
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,653
Tom, Jenn, Gregg, Katie, Caryn,

1106
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,112
not the same for you.

1107
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,947
One of you is going home

1108
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,865
tonight.

1109
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:49,699
Should be a fun afternoon

1110
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,533
back at camp.

1111
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,492
I'll see you at Tribal Council

1112
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,493
tonight.

1113
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,579
Head on back.

1114
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,014
>> I remember the jungle course

1115
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,766
being a lot easier on day three.

1116
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,517
(Jenn laughing)

1117
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,811
>> Ian won immunity for tonight.

1118
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,521
That darn gun, man, that is my

1119
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,356
Achilles heel.

1120
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,232
It's very fortunate I became a

1121
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,067
fireman rather than a cop,

1122
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,486
because it would just be

1123
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,153
dangerous for everybody.

1124
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,030
Well, that's okay.

1125
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,156
'Cause you know what?

1126
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,659
I was going five, you were going

1127
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,202
four, so rightfully so, I should

1128
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,662
be the one taking the risk.

1129
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,038
We've got a plan in place.

1130
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,207
Ian and I are gonna pretend that

1131
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,249
there's nothing going on,

1132
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,042
everything is fine.

1133
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,168
But the three of us--

1134
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,088
myself, Ian and Caryn--

1135
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,631
will vote for Gregg tonight,

1136
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,173
the other three will vote

1137
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,175
for Caryn, and then we'll

1138
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,593
go to a draw and be forced

1139
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,427
to pick a stone.

1140
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,053
But it won't be Ian who has

1141
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,555
to choose-- he won immunity.

1142
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,765
It'll be me.

1143
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,475
So I'm very vulnerable, but it's

1144
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,018
better to play it hard and go

1145
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,937
home tonight than to sit around

1146
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,105
here and just wait to be

1147
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,981
eliminated by their threesome.

1148
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,274
>> So, we're good with the

1149
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,109
immunity today.

1150
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,944
We needed Caryn not to get it.

1151
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,320
>> Yeah. We should all be pretty

1152
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,905
proud of the fact we looked

1153
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:11,948
around and said, "Hey, five

1154
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:12,615
of us."

1155
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,116
>> Right.

1156
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,158
>> Yeah.

1157
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,702
>> We're there.

1158
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,036
I was a little nervous

1159
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,079
stepping away from the game for

1160
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,080
a while, so it was comforting

1161
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,207
to come back and get no

1162
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,543
mysterious looks or no...

1163
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,336
people trying to connive.

1164
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,921
So, I can say with a lot of

1165
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:28,464
confidence that Caryn will be

1166
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,590
going home tonight.

1167
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,050
I mean, you could tell, she's

1168
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,802
just out of commission today.

1169
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,971
>> Caryn's in a Janu place, huh?

1170
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,389
>> Yeah.

1171
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,640
>> Well, that's what happens

1172
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,808
when you know you're done.

1173
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,477
>> Caryn is winning an Academy

1174
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,103
Award right now.

1175
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,522
She is lying in the hut, down

1176
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,815
and sour, like she thinks she's

1177
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,899
going home.

1178
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,358
Perfect. Just the way

1179
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,067
we told her to.

1180
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,194
So, this should be a total

1181
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,195
surprise tonight.

1182
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,659
>> I think so.

1183
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,745
>> Interesting or...

1184
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,371
>> No. Just it's gonna be...

1185
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,165
>> It's always interesting.

1186
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,250
>> Yeah.

1187
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,209
>> I'll start getting some

1188
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:05,460
firewood.

1189
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:19,015
>> All right.

1190
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,433
>> I just feel so rejuvenated.

1191
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,267
>> Yeah.

1192
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,226
>> We have a good advantage.

1193
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,604
The next one, though, is the

1194
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,229
big one.

1195
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,273
>> It's big, yeah.

1196
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,357
>> Yeah.

1197
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:34,030
Oh, exactly.

1198
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,699
>> Things going okay?

1199
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,158
>> Yeah. Yeah.

1200
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:37,492
>> Good. Good.

1201
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,118
>> I was just thinking today

1202
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,453
a lot about family, and I just

1203
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,913
wanted to talk to you about it.

1204
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,289
I told Stan right before he

1205
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,290
left, uh, I was gonna watch

1206
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,082
over you.

1207
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:45,708
>> Aw...

1208
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,584
>> And that I was gonna

1209
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,460
protect you.

1210
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,461
>> That's still the deal for me.

1211
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,504
>> Good.

1212
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,005
>> There's only two people in

1213
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:51,506
this game that I've made

1214
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,674
promises to; Tom's one, Katie's

1215
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,009
the other-- I told Katie I

1216
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,302
wouldn't write her name down,

1217
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,845
and I told her brother-in-law

1218
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,180
I had her back, and that means

1219
00:34:59,263 --> 00:34:59,555
a lot to me, so...

1220
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,307
I'm gonna stay true to that.

1221
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,725
What I wanted to talk to you

1222
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,101
about was, we're gonna flip

1223
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:04,519
it tonight.

1224
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,895
>> Yeah.

1225
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,063
>> What do you mean?

1226
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,815
>> Um, Caryn and Tom, um, and I

1227
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,149
are gonna vote for Gregg.

1228
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,692
>> Yeah.

1229
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,568
>> What?!

1230
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,694
>> Yeah, we're flipping the game

1231
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:23,579
around.

1232
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,456
We're gonna force a tie, unless

1233
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,415
you vote Gregg.

1234
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,416
>> If it's a tie, then what

1235
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:27,667
happens?

1236
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,044
>> It goes to rocks.

1237
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:31,337
You know, that's why I wanted to

1238
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,338
give you the heads-up.

1239
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,965
>> Ian pulled me aside, like,

1240
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:34,549
right before we went to Tribal

1241
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,299
Council with the idea of taking

1242
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,634
out Gregg.

1243
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,636
I had some issues with it.

1244
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,929
I'm, like, you know it's really

1245
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,138
unfair for you just to come in

1246
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:41,722
and say, this is what we're

1247
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,307
doing, this is what the plan is.

1248
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,725
Think about it-- for you and

1249
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,601
Tom, that's great.

1250
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,561
But I'm just thinking as

1251
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,728
far as I'm concerned, I was

1252
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,729
in a good place.

1253
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,730
>> I know that you're playing

1254
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,648
the game, and I know that you

1255
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,649
don't want to take me to the

1256
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,650
finals because you're afraid...

1257
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,818
>> 'Cause I wouldn't win, Ian.

1258
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,111
>> Katie, if you and I go up

1259
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,028
against each other, it's gonna

1260
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,113
be a lot closer than you think.

1261
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,990
>> That's such crap.

1262
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,578
>> He's, like, "Do I have a

1263
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,662
reason to feel paranoid?"

1264
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,205
I'm, like, I don't think so.

1265
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,206
>> No. I mean, that goes without

1266
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,084
saying, right?

1267
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,127
>> I just don't want you to get

1268
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,003
dumped.

1269
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:12,628
I'd rather see you in the final

1270
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,838
two with me.

1271
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,839
>> Right.

1272
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,465
The reason Ian wants me with him

1273
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,342
in the end is so he'll win.

1274
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,844
Tom wants the same thing.

1275
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,804
>> I'm ready to go.

1276
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,430
>> When it comes down to it,

1277
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,557
I'm gonna have to make a

1278
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,975
decision so I can have a

1279
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,517
better chance of winning.

1280
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,936
I'm here to win a million

1281
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,980
dollars just like anyone else.

1282
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,585
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1283
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,586
the members of the jury.

1284
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,589
Coby, Janu...

1285
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,757
and Steph, voted out

1286
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,342
at the last Tribal Council.

1287
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,348
Let's talk about the reward

1288
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,349
challenge.

1289
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,308
This late in the game, they can

1290
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,393
be good news/bad news.

1291
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,770
You don't want to be away from

1292
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,979
camp and miss the politics.

1293
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,397
On the other hand, if you don't

1294
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,774
win, you might miss out on

1295
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,233
something fantastic, like a

1296
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,234
surprise visit from the loved

1297
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:17,902
ones.

1298
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,528
Gregg, did it turn out to be

1299
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,321
a good thing?

1300
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,614
>> Yeah, it turned out

1301
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,199
to be a great experience.

1302
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,659
But on the other side of the

1303
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,368
coin, it-it did hurt to know

1304
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,662
that I was leaving behind

1305
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,454
three tribe members, and they

1306
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,790
didn't get to share in the

1307
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,500
opportunity, so, you know, it's

1308
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,168
a tough situation to be in.

1309
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,628
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1310
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,462
the reward challenge itself.

1311
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,382
It is designed to bring out

1312
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,341
the status of a tribe.

1313
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,052
Caryn, you were first out.

1314
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,804
Yeah, that was very hard.

1315
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,263
>> For some reason, they felt

1316
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:46,764
I had too many rewards.

1317
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,683
And I didn't feel I had won that

1318
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,059
much, but, you know, there was

1319
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:50,685
obviously some resentment about

1320
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,519
that, 'cause my torch went out

1321
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,436
like that.

1322
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,437
>> PROBST: Do you think that's

1323
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,356
all it was, you had a little

1324
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,315
more food, nothing else?

1325
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,316
>> I do think so.

1326
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,525
>> Yes.

1327
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,484
>> PROBST: How can it not have

1328
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,696
more implications than just food

1329
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,864
when you watch Gregg ask Jenn

1330
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,366
for permission about what to do?

1331
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,785
(laughter)

1332
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,786
You guys are laughing;

1333
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,745
I'm serious.

1334
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,080
We're down to the nitty-gritty

1335
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,123
here for a million bucks.

1336
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,583
Jenn, you're clearly seen as

1337
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,545
somewhat of a couple with Gregg.

1338
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,921
Are you at all worried that

1339
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,339
that's going to hurt you at some

1340
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,049
point in this big, happy family?

1341
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,259
>> I do worry about that

1342
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,260
a little bit.

1343
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,386
Um, but I do think that we're

1344
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,595
both playing a very individual

1345
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,471
game.

1346
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,348
>> I think people know that Jenn

1347
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,058
and I do have a bond and a

1348
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,893
relationship, and, you know, it

1349
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:33,436
wasn't malicious or even

1350
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,938
strategic for me to want to

1351
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,356
spend some time with her.

1352
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,941
But that's not gonna have people

1353
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:39,567
turn against each other or, you

1354
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,736
know, change your strategy for

1355
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,528
just one day away.

1356
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,905
>> PROBST: Caryn, back to you.

1357
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,115
You were first out.

1358
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,116
You brought more than anybody

1359
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:47,783
tonight.

1360
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,784
It looks like you brought

1361
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,785
everything you have.

1362
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,578
>> I've been carrying my stuff

1363
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,829
to every Tribal Council.

1364
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,123
Janu, Willard, Coby and I were

1365
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,167
not part of the five-person

1366
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:56,792
alliance.

1367
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,419
So...

1368
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,504
I always feel vulnerable.

1369
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,173
>> PROBST: Tom, it's now down

1370
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,466
to six people who have been

1371
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,717
together from day one.

1372
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,635
Has it changed how you think

1373
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,387
about voting somebody out?

1374
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,388
Because you're gonna hurt

1375
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:09,638
somebody.

1376
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,932
Somebody's going home tonight,

1377
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:12,933
and they're moving right over

1378
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:13,100
there.

1379
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,143
>> Right.

1380
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,478
We are friends, and we are

1381
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,229
looking to slit each other's

1382
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,189
throats at night.

1383
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,149
I think that right now you do

1384
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,942
have an "all is fair in love

1385
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,736
and war" attitude that's all

1386
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,570
about advancing your move

1387
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,571
down the board.

1388
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,199
>> PROBST: All right, Ian,

1389
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,658
once again, you have the

1390
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,910
immunity necklace.

1391
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:31,911
It is yours to keep or give up

1392
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:32,953
to somebody else.

1393
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:33,954
>> Um, I think I'll hold

1394
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:34,789
on to it tonight.

1395
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,790
>> PROBST: With that, it is time

1396
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,540
to vote.

1397
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,626
Tom, you're up.

1398
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,644
>> Gregg, you're the dark horse.

1399
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,229
And it's just time for the

1400
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,230
dark horse to ride off into

1401
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,315
the sunset.

1402
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,011
I'll go tally the votes.

1403
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,483
Once the votes are read, the

1404
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,110
decision is final-- person voted

1405
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:46,694
out will be asked to leave the

1406
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,863
Tribal Council area immediately.

1407
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,782
I'll read the votes.

1408
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,700
First vote.

1409
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,785
Caryn.

1410
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,665
Caryn. Two votes Caryn.

1411
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,546
Gregg. Two votes Caryn,

1412
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,631
one vote Gregg.

1413
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,553
Gregg. Two votes Caryn,

1414
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,638
two votes Gregg.

1415
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,060
Gregg. That's three votes Gregg,

1416
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,228
two votes Caryn.

1417
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,064
I'll read the last vote.

1418
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,859
13th person voted out

1419
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,444
of<i> Survivor: Palau</i> and the

1420
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,445
fourth member of our jury...

1421
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:29,653
Gregg.

1422
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,031
>> You guys are good.

1423
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,407
>> PROBST: You need to bring me

1424
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,492
your torch.

1425
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,834
Gregg, the tribe has spoken.

1426
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,757
It's time for you to go.

1427
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,602
Well, the message seems clear--

1428
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,145
with six days left, nobody's

1429
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:03,729
safe anymore.

1430
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,189
Grab your torches.

1431
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,275
Head back to camp. Good night.

1432
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,789
Stay tuned for scenes from our

1433
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,874
next episode.

1434
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,670
>> PROBST: Next time on...

1435
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,755
<i>Survivor.</i>

1436
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,756
>> I don't really have a deal

1437
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,340
with Tom.

1438
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,091
>> We know you have a deal with

1439
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:32,967
Tom.

1440
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,968
>> PROBST: The women compare

1441
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:34,134
notes.

1442
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,552
>> Katie just cleaned house.

1443
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,553
>> PROBST: And Ian and Katie

1444
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,304
have a blow-out.

1445
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,305
>> You said you would never

1446
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:38,931
lie to me, and you did.

1447
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:39,723
>> Damn!

1448
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,183
>> You didn't even think about

1449
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:41,809
how that was gonna make me feel

1450
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,310
to have you go against your

1451
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,019
word.

1452
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,104
>> You want me to step out?

1453
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,189
I mean, I'll do it. I'll do it.

1454
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,153
>> I think I'd be lying if I

1455
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,154
said I wasn't completely

1456
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,072
surprised.

1457
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,573
My hat's off to 'em, though.

1458
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,242
They got me, they got me good.

1459
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,244
Um, I learned a lot of things.

1460
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:00,869
An experience is nothing unless

1461
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,122
you share it with other people

1462
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:03,664
who you love.

1463
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,374
Jenn, best of luck.

1464
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,334
I appreciate your friendship

1465
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,752
out on the island, and, uh, look

1466
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,839
forward to... hanging out soon.
