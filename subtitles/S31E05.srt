translated from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:01,226 --> 00:00:03,618
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:06,205
With three tribes in play,

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,749
each had its own story.

5
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:10,017
Ta Keo...

6
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:12,468
Joe picks up a coin on his own.

7
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:14,061
...was at the top of his game.

8
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:15,589
Ta Keo wins immunity!

9
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:17,551
I doubt we'll lose
any trials.

10
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:20,895
Bayon had yet to lose,
but was far from unity.

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,255
Spencer and Wigglesworth
are in the minority.

12
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:24,799
As for Angkor...

13
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,292
I hate this place!

14
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:27,968
...it was a disaster.

15
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:30,429
Neither resources nor shelter.

16
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:31,902
It must change.

17
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:33,465
We are in hell.

18
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,426
And they lost their second
immunity test in a row.

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,742
Angkor returns to council

20
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:42,183
for the 2nd time in a row!

21
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,951
Approaching the board,

22
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:45,352
Savage et Tasha

23
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:48,155
wanted to eliminate
the greatest strategic threat.

24
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,849
- Jeff has to go.
- He's very cunning.

25
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:54,128
But Abi had a grudge against Woo.

26
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:56,464
He voted against me twice!

27
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,866
It all comes down to winning events

28
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:00,802
versus trust and loyalty.

29
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,561
I have to weigh the pros and cons.

30
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:05,164
At the council, Woo pleaded his case.

31
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:08,558
Abi, I promise you,
here and now.

32
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,469
I will stay loyal.

33
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:13,247
And it was Varner who was eliminated.

34
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,182
The tribe has spoken.

35
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:17,921
There are 16 left.

36
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,029
Who will be eliminated tonight?

37
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,234
The friends,

38
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,991
thank you for believing in me.

39
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:36,639
Thanks for believing in us.

40
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,707
Thank you, Abi.
I really appreciate.

41
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,990
I'm here, I can
continue to fight.

42
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,646
I'm so happy.

43
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,229
Thank you for everything, my brother.

44
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:50,617
Four tips in 11 days,
I never get used to it.

45
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,606
I hope I can
delay the next ones,

46
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,314
now that we are strong.

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,324
- It was really hard.
- I say.

48
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:58,893
He is better off where he is.

49
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,632
We have to win races.

50
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:04,431
But if we don't recover quickly,

51
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,272
we could leave all four.

52
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:08,847
- You were really good, Woo!
- Yeah, he was...

53
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,605
- Woo was fighting!
- He was fighting !

54
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,278
- Like never !
- He had to ! I was freaking out!

55
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:18,495
I had to decide
between Varner and Woo.

56
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,105
And I kept Woo.

57
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:22,936
I don't like
people to be indebted to me.

58
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:26,244
But if he still writes my name,

59
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:27,834
he is dead in my eyes.

60
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:36,092
- Cheer.
- Give me a hug !

61
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:38,914
- You know that I love you.
- Me too.

62
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,261
You are my little sister.

63
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:41,800
Oh my God !

64
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,688
We did it ?!

65
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,183
I would never have believed it.
I would have said you were losing your mind.

66
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,241
Six days ago, I said to myself:

67
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:52,905
mission impossible.

68
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,607
Not only the conditions,

69
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:59,386
but the mental toughness
to climb from the bottom to the top.

70
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,558
We did damn well.

71
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:04,284
I wouldn't want to relive
the last five days.

72
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:05,421
Non.

73
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:07,728
But that's part of the game.
And I play it.

74
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,763
And I'll keep playing it

75
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:12,120
until my situation changes.

76
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:40,620
Attention !

77
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:42,663
Zut !

78
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:44,089
Nothing in the net?

79
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:45,800
Cunning little bastards!

80
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,536
Kimmi, Wigglesworth et al.,

81
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:52,773
we like to get up to get
clams and crabs.

82
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:54,212
I got it !

83
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:55,875
Yeah !

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,678
- Owl !
- Great !

85
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:59,952
We bring back the protein
for the boys.

86
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:01,941
We are the feeders.
And that's fine with us.

87
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,543
Because women should
stay strong and united.

88
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:06,580
Ah! Big clams!

89
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,949
- Clams?
- Yes !

90
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,710
- Do you need the hammer?
- Nope !

91
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:18,958
We shouldn't take
all the big clams.

92
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,410
We'll put them aside
in the basket.

93
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,046
We're going to exhaust the whole area.

94
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:26,140
It will renew itself,
and then they move.

95
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,498
But compare how many we found
on the 1st day, and now.

96
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:31,626
Because we go less far.

97
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,705
No matter.
Do you want to eat or not?

98
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,902
Of course, but...

99
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:38,116
We'll put them in the bag.
No need to eat it all now.

100
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:41,465
- We'll save some for tomorrow.
- We should stop fishing them.

101
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,294
- No more clams.
- No, I want to eat!

102
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,210
I know, Kimmi, but we're draining
the sea of ​​its clams.

103
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:49,400
I know Kimmi tryna harvest

104
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:52,099
all
possible large clams,

105
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,892
so i try to encourage him

106
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:57,496
not really
always picking up the maximum,

107
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:00,642
because we could be here
another 27 days.

108
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,448
And if we continue to eat
everything in the sea,

109
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:05,068
there won't be much left.

110
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:07,306
There is three.
That's all I bring.

111
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:10,217
That's a big difference
in this Second Chance.

112
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:12,326
I don't live day to day

113
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:15,389
but rather considering
the end of the game.

114
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:19,264
I mustn't close any doors,
the game is far from over.

115
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,100
Kimmi, we got you some crab.

116
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,731
Yes, we have crab and clams.

117
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,457
And that delights me.

118
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,471
I have to work
on my patience a little more,

119
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,908
because Monica tends to wear him out.

120
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,205
I say to myself:
what we find, we eat.

121
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:40,040
The ocean won't run out

122
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:42,249
if the six of us eat something.

123
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,051
a wish

124
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,214
it's better than two to get it.

125
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:48,356
She doesn't know that?!

126
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,559
She's like,
"Leave them in the ocean!"

127
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:55,136
- Lord !
- We have to eat, shit!

128
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:58,232
"No need to eat.
Let's leave them in the ocean,

129
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,836
otherwise we will deplete
the resources of the entire ocean."

130
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:03,421
Is...

131
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,432
No. No, darling, no.

132
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:07,900
You know what ?

133
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:10,833
If my biggest problem here
is Monica,

134
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,438
is that I'm doing well.

135
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:16,235
Instead of being very emotional
in my reactions,

136
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,948
I avoid making waves.

137
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,244
I just have to remember:

138
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:21,730
self-control !

139
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:23,716
I am more mature and wiser.

140
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:26,463
But I'm not used to

141
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,658
giving me opinions
that I don't care about.

142
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,418
Over here, everyone!

143
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:09,902
Ta Keo, Bayon,

144
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:12,945
discover the new Angkor tribe.

145
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:16,676
Varner, eliminated at the last council.

146
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:20,680
Ready for
today's reward event?

147
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:21,939
Oui !

148
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:23,897
Today,

149
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,399
three members of each tribe
will be tied together.

150
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,357
The fourth will be in a barrel.

151
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:32,149
On my signal you will roll it
to a series of masts,

152
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,253
where the person in the barrel
has to collect bags of balls

153
00:07:35,378 --> 00:07:36,996
then return to the barrel.

154
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:38,923
Once the three bags have been collected,

155
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:41,367
you will have to roll them

156
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:43,422
in order to place them in targets.

157
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,076
The first two tribes to finish
win the reward.

158
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:48,174
- Do you want to know what's at stake?
- Yes !

159
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,600
For the first...

160
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:52,473
Comfort.

161
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:55,882
Chairs, pillows, blankets,

162
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,383
hammock, candles

163
00:07:57,508 --> 00:07:58,521
and tarp.

164
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,353
Oh my God !

165
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,281
In addition, some refreshments will be waiting for you at the camp .

166
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,328
A nice way
to recover from a tough ordeal.

167
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:12,162
For the second:
not as exciting, but effective.

168
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,291
A tarp.

169
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,468
It will protect you from
the sun and the rain.

170
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:17,437
For the third: nada.

171
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:19,131
Nothing at all.

172
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,242
This event has only been played
once, in Blood vs. Water,

173
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,632
Ciera's season.

174
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:27,038
Your tribe participated and lost.

175
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:29,644
So it's a second chance for Ciera.

176
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,941
Ta Keo, Bayon,
you have two more members.

177
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,624
The same cannot be discarded
in 2 consecutive events.

178
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,347
Those who do not participate here

179
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,958
will take part
in the immunity test.

180
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:40,706
I'm out.

181
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:44,092
Who does not participate, Ta Keo?
Deitz et Kass.

182
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:45,723
Bayon, what about you?

183
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:47,266
Fishbach et Wigglesworth.

184
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:49,156
You four
take a seat on the bench.

185
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,938
The others, I'll give you
a minute to organize yourselves.

186
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,000
Alright, here we go.
For the reward.

187
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,136
Survivors, ready?

188
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:01,047
Go !

189
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:03,549
It's Woo,

190
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:04,751
Monica

191
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,753
and Wentworth in the barrels.

192
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:09,147
- Your Keo!
- It's teamwork.

193
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:12,583
You have to reach the first pedestal
so they can get out of the barrel

194
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,152
and release the bag of balls.

195
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:15,720
- Come on Kel!
- Go ahead, Ta Keo!

196
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:17,688
- Are you okay, Monica?
- Go ahead, Bayon!

197
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:19,991
Go ahead, Angkor!

198
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:21,868
You have to get out of the barrel, climb

199
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:23,772
and release that bag of bullets.

200
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,030
This is where you will win
or lose time.

201
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:28,366
Wentworth, lightning fast!

202
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:30,902
Wentworth has its own!

203
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,104
Woo has his!

204
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,182
Monica is slower.

205
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:37,853
Ahead !

206
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,352
Come on !

207
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:42,280
The Angkors are gone,
the Ta Keos are gone.

208
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:45,094
Monica is still on the 1st bag.

209
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:47,560
Bayon wastes a lot of time

210
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,922
with Monica in the barrel.

211
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,856
Now
the Bayons can go again.

212
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:53,095
Come on !

213
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,393
On your side ! On your side !

214
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:57,178
- Go on !
- Forward, Kelley!

215
00:09:57,303 --> 00:09:58,396
Wentworth ressort.

216
00:09:58,521 --> 00:09:59,897
Woo came out.

217
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:02,775
He wastes no time.

218
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,545
Bayon goes in all directions.

219
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:07,536
Come on Monica!

220
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:09,107
I'm upside down.

221
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:11,309
Woo has the 2nd bag for Angkor.

222
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:14,313
Wentworth has the 2nd sack for Ta Keo.

223
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,775
They are going to get
their 3rd and last bag.

224
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,394
Monica, again,

225
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,654
very slow for Bayon.

226
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,499
It's like the Sunday picnic
of the parish.

227
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:27,718
Move on !

228
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,670
Monica finally has the 2nd bag for Bayon.

229
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:34,332
Woo has the 3rd bag for Angkor.

230
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,128
Wentworth has the 3rd sack for Ta Keo.

231
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:42,352
Go on ! Go on !

232
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:47,720
Monica is on the 3rd sack for Bayon.

233
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:50,556
- Big circles!
- Make circles!

234
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,317
You have to put it on the base!

235
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,094
Go ahead, Angkor!

236
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:57,426
Your Keo is good!

237
00:10:57,881 --> 00:10:59,123
Everybody out !

238
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,792
You can throw the balls!

239
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:05,205
Monica finally has the 3rd bag for Bayon.

240
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,320
Woo lance pour Angkor.

241
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:10,666
Yeah, Woo!

242
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:13,413
Keith pitches for Ta Keo.

243
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:14,572
Come on, Keith!

244
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:16,545
Bayon, we have to speed up!

245
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,342
Come on, forward!

246
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,779
Go ahead, Bayon!

247
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,987
It will be Jeremy for Bayon.

248
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:26,451
Everyone
is now on the balls.

249
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:29,520
You have to place the six balls,
each in a hole.

250
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:32,165
Yeah, Keith, good!

251
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,025
Keith places 1st for Ta Keo.

252
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:35,460
Presque !

253
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:37,962
Yeah, Woo!

254
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,764
Woo places 1st for Angkor.

255
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,199
Tied, 1-1.

256
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,301
Jeremy springs into action.

257
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:45,919
- Cheer !
- Good ! Good !

258
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:47,872
And here is Bayon
back in the race.

259
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:50,550
Tie, 1 everywhere.

260
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:55,346
- Yes, Keith!
- Keith sets up a 2nd one for Ta Keo.

261
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:00,019
- Yes !
- Woo up a 2nd for Angkor.

262
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:01,385
New equality.

263
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,755
A 3rd for Keith.

264
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,508
A 3rd for Woo.
New equality.

265
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:12,084
Bayon is again left behind.

266
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,406
Good ! Ouch!

267
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:15,233
You will succeed !

268
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:20,580
Woo up a 4th for Angkor.
Angkor leads with 4.

269
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,115
Come on, Keith!

270
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,542
Keith sets up a 4th.
Equality.

271
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:27,547
Jeremy still shoots for Bayon,
without much success.

272
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,086
- You want ?
- Yeah, come on.

273
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:30,715
Spencer comes to replace Jeremy.

274
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,175
You have to have the touch.

275
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:39,791
- Yeah !
- Cheer !

276
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,522
Spencer sets up one for Bayon.

277
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:42,894
- And There you go !
- Yeah !

278
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,797
Two in a row for Spencer,
3 points for Bayon.

279
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:48,299
A 3rd in a row for Spencer!

280
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:49,963
Equality!

281
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:51,678
4 everywhere!

282
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,781
Yes Keith! One more !

283
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:56,908
Keith places 5th for Ta Keo.

284
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,419
Ta Keo now leads with 5.

285
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:02,146
The first two to finish
win a reward.

286
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,986
Keith succeeds for Ta Keo!

287
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:08,661
Ta Keo wins comfort
and refreshments

288
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:10,029
on the field!

289
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:11,989
Bayon and Angkor

290
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:13,691
are vying for 2nd place.

291
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,269
Angkor is at 4,

292
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:17,428
Bayon is at 4.

293
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,996
It's good, my brother!

294
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:23,009
And a 5th for Angkor!

295
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:25,545
Angkor is at 5, more than one!

296
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,371
It's always good, Spencer!

297
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,982
Ah! Go home !

298
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:30,675
Spencer just misses.

299
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,918
Woo can make his tribe win.

300
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,292
Angkor wins an award

301
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:40,950
in the form of a tarp!

302
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:43,262
Bayon fails.

303
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:48,626
Ta Keo!

304
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:50,970
Ciera, your second chance!

305
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:54,941
It worked ! Redemption!
Nice reward for your tribe.

306
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:56,491
many objects,

307
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,503
and cold drinks
on your camp,

308
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,663
something to snack on.

309
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:02,415
Come get your things,

310
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,775
return to camp.

311
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:08,600
It's a nice catch.

312
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:11,783
Angkor is not
as big,

313
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:14,237
and it is perhaps even
above all symbolic,

314
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:15,831
but it remains a tarp,

315
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,523
which will protect you from the sun
and the rain. Come get her.

316
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:20,741
Take your things,
return to camp.

317
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:23,094
- A win is a win.
- A win is a win!

318
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:24,227
Merci.

319
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:31,790
Bayon, I have nothing for you.
Take your things, return to camp.

320
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:53,390
Well done, friends!

321
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:55,734
Let's see what we have here!

322
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:58,136
- Jus d'orange.
- [???]

323
00:14:58,386 --> 00:14:59,861
- Health !
- To Ta Keo!

324
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:02,333
- Another reward!
- To Survivor Second Chance!

325
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,409
Winning is the elixir.

326
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,770
It boosts our confidence.

327
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,530
Another award won!

328
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:11,126
I'm pretending there
's rum in it, so watch out!

329
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:12,342
Me too !

330
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,211
We won
chairs with cushions.

331
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:16,852
Wow, thank you!

332
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:18,627
Where is my crown?

333
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:23,395
We have a nice hammock,
pillows,

334
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,663
fresh fruit...

335
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:26,356
This is tropical camping!

336
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:28,466
Are we going to look for fish?

337
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:30,834
- We have fruit.
- We have pineapple juice.

338
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,838
We have all the necessary food.
And if we miss it,

339
00:15:33,963 --> 00:15:37,334
we go to the supermarket, right there,
and we grab something!

340
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:39,377
- Good luck !
- Thanks !

341
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:40,804
I'm having fun !

342
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,147
It's awesome !

343
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:45,436
It goes well.

344
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:48,678
But I'm worried about the merger.
We have to discuss it.

345
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:50,897
What is our plan?

346
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:53,717
I see the merge like this:

347
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,228
we need a close-knit group of five.

348
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:59,125
If we stay five together, we five,

349
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,924
- Everything will be alright.
- Yeah.

350
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,968
But everyone, in my season,

351
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,588
wanted to get me out right away.

352
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,421
"Joe is the biggest target.
Joe is dangerous on the races."

353
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,260
I have no interest in eliminating you.

354
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,678
The difference

355
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:14,446
with the last time,
in this Second Chance,

356
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:17,391
is that I try to recruit
as many people as possible

357
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:20,650
to have a majority in the merger.

358
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:25,072
Because I always feel
like I'm the most dangerous.

359
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:28,083
But I'm clearly playing
the 1st half of the game

360
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,295
much better than last time.

361
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,763
We are the final quintet.

362
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,565
As long as we remain allies,

363
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,029
we just have to find
something to be in the majority.

364
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:39,462
We are five welded,
with Deitz next door.

365
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:42,298
And personally,
I saw Terry's branch

366
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:44,276
since the shift change.

367
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,629
So I really like
this group of five, without Deitz.

368
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:49,681
But may Terry continue
to feel good!

369
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:52,017
- Oh yeah !
- No problem.

370
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:55,120
It's all new to me.

371
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,923
That was my problem the first time.
I didn't ally myself with anyone.

372
00:16:58,048 --> 00:16:59,509
And here I have four.

373
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:03,395
This is the first time we've approached Keith
to say, "Let's do this!"

374
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,208
At 5, not just at 2!

375
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:09,034
At 2, we're not going anywhere.
But 5 could take me to the end.

376
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:20,078
- Have fun !
- [???]

377
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:21,237
Good luck !

378
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,751
Do we roll it?

379
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,423
[???]

380
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:30,714
The trend seems to be: gain
immunity, lose reward.

381
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:33,786
Today we lost.
And I was very hungry.

382
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:36,228
So, with Jeremy,
we took the boat

383
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:37,754
to go fishing.

384
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:38,900
Have fun !

385
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:42,654
The original four Bayons
remain tightly knit.

386
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,052
Wigglesworth and I
are in the minority.

387
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:48,026
But Jeremy is outspoken,
he's a straight guy.

388
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,566
We can make connections

389
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:53,813
and become a strong duo
that could become a force.

390
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,019
- Have you ever done this?
- No, Joe does it all the time.

391
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,209
- It's his element.
- Yeah, he loves it.

392
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,821
I hold it.

393
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:06,485
The first time, I came
to Survivor as a super-fan.

394
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,718
I saw these guys,

395
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:10,943
like Ozzy, or even Joe,

396
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:14,324
fish, spear,
supply their tribe.

397
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:17,147
- Let's see how it goes.
- Let's go!

398
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,605
I think I've always seen myself

399
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,575
like a weird and brainy kid

400
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,168
unable to do that.

401
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,651
But here I am, and I do.

402
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:35,712
I don't like Survivor vicariously anymore
, I live it.

403
00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:42,954
It's one of those Survivor dreams

404
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,697
that I thought about a lot

405
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,187
and I finally realize.

406
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:49,451
It was a great moment,
I was proud of myself.

407
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,236
That's a tarp!

408
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:01,513
Yeah.

409
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:06,051
All those rainy days and nights
at Chuck E. Cheese paid off.

410
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:09,066
To finish second, for us,
is to finish first.

411
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,349
It was good.

412
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,952
The victory was great,

413
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:15,151
morally and spiritually.

414
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,278
- We have a winning streak.
- Yeah.

415
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,147
We have to win immunity tomorrow.

416
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:21,591
I have here a 2nd chance,

417
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:25,261
and my mom is clearly
a big inspiration to move forward.

418
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:28,206
What was wrong
with your mother's heart?

419
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:30,235
She had
a big heart attack.

420
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,435
The doctor arrives:

421
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,038
"Your mother only has
a few days left,

422
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:38,283
We put her on the top of the list
for a transplant."

423
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:41,186
And thank God,

424
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:43,870
we received a call:
"Hey, we have a heart for your mother!"

425
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:45,557
"Oh, formidable !"

426
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:47,893
So she had her transplant,

427
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:49,951
at the time of season 28.

428
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:52,789
To see someone like her

429
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,448
go through what she went through,

430
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:01,006
and never give up,
because she loved us

431
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:03,700
and would never have left us,

432
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:07,880
it inspires me a lot

433
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:10,122
to keep fighting
for what I want.

434
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:12,150
- That's crazy.
- Nice story, Woo.

435
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,605
It's scary.

436
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,602
Life is Beautiful.

437
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:17,761
Life is precious.

438
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:18,887
I love life.

439
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:20,383
My mother had a second chance.

440
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:24,062
I clearly play for her

441
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:26,208
and also for all those
who voted for me.

442
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,701
Because without them, I wouldn't have
this second life in this game.

443
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,029
My grandmother went through the same thing

444
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:36,599
and didn't have the same luck.

445
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,645
I lost my auntie, too,

446
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,372
very early.

447
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:45,100
Woo pissed me off a bit.

448
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:48,220
I think he uses this story

449
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:49,838
to draw people to him.

450
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:53,979
Of course, it could have happened to him,
and his mother, and I sympathize.

451
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:57,360
But hey, I had a tendon transplant
in my knee.

452
00:20:58,118 --> 00:21:01,758
I also have a piece
of someone else's body.

453
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:03,827
Woo plays very well.

454
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:07,052
His way of getting your sympathy

455
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:09,709
with the story of his mother...

456
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:13,445
- Oh, sure!
- It's a great story, great,

457
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,114
but, Lord!
I was like, well...

458
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,246
Yeah, clear...

459
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:19,721
Should I start
unpacking everything too?

460
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,111
- Exactly.
- Nope.

461
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:23,755
Woo and Abi,

462
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,499
It's day and night.

463
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,559
With Abi,

464
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:30,580
I need all my resources

465
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:32,722
just to be with her.

466
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:35,158
She still worries.

467
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:37,591
It's alive !

468
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:39,639
It's hard work,
working with Abi.

469
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:40,765
Woo ?

470
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,426
We can give him his
marching order just before the council,

471
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:44,664
and it will roll.

472
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:45,869
Abi ?...

473
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:47,573
She won't do that.

474
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:49,260
In the event of a merger,

475
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:52,342
it will be twice as hard
to maneuver with Abi.

476
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,486
It's a ticking time bomb.

477
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:56,505
But at the same time,
she saved my place.

478
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,134
I don't want to decide
based on emotions and fire her.

479
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:01,318
I want to make
the right decision for my game.

480
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:04,087
But for my sanity,
it might be necessary.

481
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:23,513
Over here, everyone!

482
00:22:38,378 --> 00:22:40,856
Ready for
today's immunity test?

483
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:44,034
First of all, I take back the idols.

484
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:45,727
Kimmi.

485
00:22:45,852 --> 00:22:46,995
Wentworth.

486
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:51,131
Once again,
immunity is at stake.

487
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:52,300
Today,

488
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:54,659
at my signal,
you will climb a tower,

489
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:57,149
crossing a series of obstacles
to the top.

490
00:22:57,274 --> 00:22:59,953
From the top
you will throw sandbags,

491
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,077
to hit a series of targets.

492
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:04,411
The first two tribes

493
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:06,481
hit all their targets...

494
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,088
gain immunity, shielded from the vote.

495
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:14,623
Losers go to the board

496
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:16,992
where someone will be the 5th person

497
00:23:17,117 --> 00:23:18,735
eliminated from the game.

498
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,929
This event was run
for the first time

499
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:22,706
last season.

500
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:24,802
Joe's tribe participated in it and...?

501
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:25,934
Lost.

502
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:27,066
Lost.

503
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:29,046
A second chance for Joe

504
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:30,414
to rewrite history.

505
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,944
Ta Keo, you are 2 more.

506
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:34,329
You cannot discard
the same 2 times in a row.

507
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,331
It was Deitz and Kass
last time.

508
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,480
- Who will it be?
- Kelley and me.

509
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:40,943
Ciera and Kelley
are not participating at Ta Keo.

510
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:42,084
Bayon.

511
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:44,910
Last time, Wigglesworth
and Fishbach did not participate.

512
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,694
Who will it be this time?

513
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:48,332
Jeremy et Monica.

514
00:23:48,457 --> 00:23:50,000
Jeremy and Monica at Bayon.

515
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,660
Take a seat on the bench.

516
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,272
The others, a minute of organization
and we begin.

517
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,504
Well, on and go.

518
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,573
For immunity.
Survivors, ready?

519
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,075
Go !

520
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:11,054
Go to the carpet
and send a first team member.

521
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:12,180
It will be Joe,

522
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:14,488
Spencer and Savage,

523
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,284
who go first.

524
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:19,921
Joe is upstairs.

525
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:22,399
Spencer is on his heels.

526
00:24:22,524 --> 00:24:24,183
- This is Savage.
- Come on, Savage!

527
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:26,136
There's a hit to take

528
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:28,130
with the "Survivor" slingshot.

529
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:31,631
Spencer shoots first.

530
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,443
It's too short.

531
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:36,213
Savage, too long.

532
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:40,617
Joe scores on the first down!

533
00:24:40,742 --> 00:24:42,065
Go ahead, Ta Keo!

534
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,212
When you score,
you have to change.

535
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:46,681
Everyone must shoot
at least once.

536
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:49,484
Spencer scores!
Go ahead, Bayon!

537
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:51,420
Wigglesworth s'élance.

538
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:55,757
Savage touches! Go for it !

539
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,192
Here is Woo!

540
00:24:57,317 --> 00:24:58,568
Equality.

541
00:24:58,693 --> 00:25:00,203
1-1-1.

542
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,213
- Close, Keith!
- Keith just misses.

543
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:03,732
Wigglesworth va tirer.

544
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:08,203
Go ahead, Bayon!

545
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:09,799
Wigglesworth touche !

546
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:11,999
Bayon now leads 2-1.

547
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:13,608
Woo touch!

548
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,252
Go ahead, Angkor!

549
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:19,175
Tied, 2-2 for Bayon and Angkor.

550
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,415
1 for Ta Keo.

551
00:25:21,808 --> 00:25:23,407
Keith misses again.

552
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:25,486
This is Fishbach for Bayon.

553
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:27,656
He's hitting the wrong target!

554
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,358
Fishbach scores for Angkor!

555
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:31,793
It will count!

556
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:33,704
Big mistake !

557
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:36,433
- Way back!
- Keith shoots again.

558
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:39,167
- Yes, Keith!
- Keith scores for Ta Keo.

559
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:43,512
Fishbach only managed
to give Angkor a point.

560
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:44,639
It was nothing !

561
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:51,713
Tasha scores first time

562
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:53,156
for Angkor!

563
00:25:55,775 --> 00:25:57,727
Deitz brand for Ta Keo!

564
00:25:57,852 --> 00:25:58,987
3 for Ta Keo,

565
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:00,689
2 for Bayon,

566
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,899
- 4 for Angkor.
- Fine, Abi, come on!

567
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:05,193
Abi could make Angkor win
on this one.

568
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,838
They haven't
won immunity yet.

569
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:09,164
Far too short.

570
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:11,133
- I stop!
- Abi comes back down.

571
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:12,267
Here is Woo.

572
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:14,711
Kimmi tire.

573
00:26:15,632 --> 00:26:17,147
It's too short.

574
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:19,313
Woo is back for Angkor,

575
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,309
he could win now.

576
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,178
Woo tire.

577
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:27,285
Above.

578
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,483
Kimmi tire...

579
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,362
- ...and almost scores for Angkor!
- Come back down!

580
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:33,986
- Come back down!
- Come back down!

581
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:36,800
Kimmi comes back down.
Spencer goes back.

582
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:38,794
Come on Kass!

583
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,897
- Come on, Kass, go all out!
- This is Kass for Ta Keo.

584
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:43,899
- Come on, Woo!
- Woo shoots

585
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:45,429
For victory.

586
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,738
And he scores for Angkor!

587
00:26:49,863 --> 00:26:51,919
Angkor wins immunity!

588
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,545
There is one spot left!

589
00:26:57,069 --> 00:26:59,614
- Kass completely misses his shot.
- Kass, come down!

590
00:27:03,276 --> 00:27:04,786
Spencer scores for Bayon!

591
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:07,392
He comes back down.
This is Wigglesworth.

592
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:10,492
We now have
3 for Bayon, 3 for Ta Keo.

593
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:13,161
- Come on, Joe!
- Here's Joe for Ta Keo.

594
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:16,873
Angkor won
its first immunity.

595
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:19,343
No advice tonight for them.

596
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:21,603
- Come on, Joe!
- Joe is back for Ta Keo,

597
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,680
as well as Wigglesworth for Bayon.

598
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:24,840
Come on, Joe!

599
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:27,195
Its good.

600
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,244
Joe touches for Ta Keo.
Come back down!

601
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:33,237
4 pour Ta Keo, 3 pour Wigglesworth.

602
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:35,283
One more for Ta Keo.

603
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:37,886
- This is Keith.
- Thoroughly! Really thoroughly!

604
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:42,157
Too short for Kelly.
She comes back down.

605
00:27:42,282 --> 00:27:44,101
Spencer returns.

606
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:46,528
- Keith shoots for the win.
- Louder, Keith!

607
00:27:46,653 --> 00:27:47,796
Much stronger!

608
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:50,999
Spencer will try to equalize.
He assured in this test.

609
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:52,934
- Come on, Spence!
- Come on, Keith!

610
00:27:55,428 --> 00:27:56,980
Keith just misses.

611
00:27:57,105 --> 00:27:59,007
Can Spencer equalize?

612
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,317
He just misses.

613
00:28:00,442 --> 00:28:01,960
Keith, for the win...

614
00:28:02,284 --> 00:28:03,467
Its good !

615
00:28:05,614 --> 00:28:07,616
Ta Keo wins immunity

616
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:10,594
and send Bayon to the council!

617
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:18,230
Yeah, Ta Keo, come on!

618
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:21,897
- Better to be a hammer than a nail!
- Congratulations, friends!

619
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:23,418
I boy!

620
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:28,312
Angkor, congratulations.

621
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:33,141
Woo, you're not even waiting
for me to bring it to you!

622
00:28:33,701 --> 00:28:36,787
First immunity for Angkor,
no advice.

623
00:28:36,912 --> 00:28:38,480
Ta Keo, once more.

624
00:28:38,605 --> 00:28:39,733
Immunity.

625
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:42,619
No one will leave Ta Keo.

626
00:28:42,744 --> 00:28:44,211
Drive the point home, Keith!

627
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,729
Angkor, Ta Keo,

628
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:47,716
get your stuff,
go back to camp.

629
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:49,291
No advice tonight

630
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:51,312
no one is leaving.

631
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:53,862
As for the Bayon tribe,

632
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:56,398
most of you have
n't even been to the council yet

633
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:58,510
after 13 days of play.

634
00:28:58,635 --> 00:29:01,311
Monica, how will this impact
this band?

635
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:03,710
It can
only strengthen us, in fact.

636
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:05,883
We'll find out what's going on,

637
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:08,707
who is trustworthy,
who is loyal.

638
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,321
Going to counseling
is not a problem.

639
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:13,624
We will be fixed this evening.

640
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:15,617
Take your things,
return to camp.

641
00:29:15,742 --> 00:29:16,956
See you tonight at the council,

642
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:19,529
where someone will be the 5th person

643
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:21,523
eliminated from Survivor Second Chance.

644
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:26,106
Clearly
it's Wigglesworth and me

645
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:28,697
who we face
to find out who will leave.

646
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,273
The alliance of the 4 original Bayon
remains very united.

647
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:34,497
She will be hard to break.

648
00:29:34,622 --> 00:29:36,914
I hope that at least

649
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,474
some of the bonds
I've made will hold.

650
00:29:54,622 --> 00:29:56,998
I'll say it once
so as not to add too much:

651
00:29:57,123 --> 00:29:58,525
I am really sorry.

652
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,642
There are four original Bayon,

653
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:04,440
and then there's Wiggles and Spencer,
who are on the sidelines.

654
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,033
We win, we lose.

655
00:30:06,158 --> 00:30:08,444
Sorry for not doing better.

656
00:30:08,694 --> 00:30:10,412
I just wonder:

657
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:13,816
Who do I trust the most?
For the rest of the game.

658
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:17,714
Do I trust Spencer?
Or Wigglesworth?

659
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:20,906
How are you ?

660
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:22,916
Yeah, but I hate
going to the council.

661
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,157
It sucks.

662
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:28,122
I don't believe any
of them have the idol.

663
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,190
No, me neither.

664
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:33,335
I have more faith
in Wigglesworth, but I think

665
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,416
- that Spencer...
- ...needs us anymore.

666
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,730
Yes. So who are we targeting?

667
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:39,342
I stay on Kelly.

668
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,402
- Are we aiming for Kelly?
- Always Kelly.

669
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,996
I would find it strange
that Wigglesworth

670
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:51,440
don't ask what's going on.

671
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:52,992
- Yeah.
- You see ?

672
00:30:53,414 --> 00:30:55,683
Being at the bottom of the ladder,
which I'm used to,

673
00:30:55,808 --> 00:30:57,658
I have to impose myself
in the discussions.

674
00:30:57,783 --> 00:30:59,019
So how are you?

675
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:00,909
- Ça me va.
- Wigglesworth ?

676
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:03,078
- Yeah.
- OK.

677
00:31:03,203 --> 00:31:05,259
- We all agree.
- We all agree.

678
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:07,279
I just wanted
to keep up to date

679
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:10,103
and make sure Wigglesworth
was the target.

680
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:12,016
And you, it's good,

681
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:13,900
- do you trust me?
- Yeah.

682
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:16,519
Kelly worries us more,
in case she...

683
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:17,805
Mon instinct,

684
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,961
being of an anxious nature,

685
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,876
is to check again and again
that I risk nothing.

686
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:25,967
But these people
are looking for loyalty.

687
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,609
And it depends a lot
on the impression you give.

688
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:31,360
It becomes essential

689
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:35,334
to appear sincere, calm, confident.

690
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:36,857
It goes against

691
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:39,936
of everything in me that loves this game,

692
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:41,895
but I have to play it cool.

693
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:48,260
Kelly,

694
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:51,106
I think she will leave.

695
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:53,614
I'm not sure I
want to eliminate Wigglesworth.

696
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:54,751
I think that...

697
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:56,944
garder Wigglesworth

698
00:31:57,069 --> 00:31:58,882
could benefit my game.

699
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:01,190
In the hope of, perhaps,

700
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:02,736
create a female alliance.

701
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,050
We might also want to
preserve the female workforce.

702
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,409
Because there, we are equal.

703
00:32:09,781 --> 00:32:12,440
We have four original Bayons.

704
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:14,595
It's our roots.

705
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,574
Suddenly, Monica is looking
to create something between girls.

706
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:22,143
I don't know where she's going,
she's gonna ruin something.

707
00:32:22,268 --> 00:32:25,513
- We four must stick together.
- OK.

708
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:28,108
- 100 %.
- It is all good.

709
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:30,944
Monica playing Survivor,

710
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:32,574
it puts us in danger,

711
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:34,815
it is unpredictable
and will switch sides.

712
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:41,613
It's a fucking snake
hiding in the grass.

713
00:32:41,738 --> 00:32:43,819
A snake hiding in the grass.

714
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:47,303
My ambition is to reach the end.

715
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,472
And there will be casualties.

716
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:53,444
Monica doesn't play
for the Bayon Tribe.

717
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,652
Monica plays for Monica.

718
00:32:55,777 --> 00:33:00,687
And she'll walk over us,
thinking she's got us.

719
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,710
But she will be the turkey of the farce.

720
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,772
We were talking, okay?

721
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:09,583
I asked
his opinion: Spencer or Kelly?

722
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,795
And she goes: "Shouldn't we
preserve the female workforce?"

723
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:16,784
She wants to leave or what?

724
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:19,063
I don't know what she...

725
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,814
We have to hit her. She must...

726
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:25,374
- It's a snake.
- She's unpredictable.

727
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:27,716
She's gonna screw it all up.
We are in a great position.

728
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:31,411
I'm just thinking:
if we go to Monica,

729
00:33:31,536 --> 00:33:33,716
with Spencer on our side?

730
00:33:34,457 --> 00:33:37,145
Spencer will agree to anything,
he has no one else.

731
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,999
I don't want this,

732
00:33:39,124 --> 00:33:41,742
but if she keeps saying that,

733
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:44,485
- "Let's keep the girls"...
- To sow discord.

734
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,690
What if Monica
went to see Kelly and Spencer:

735
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:51,158
"Hey, I'm coming with you
and we're taking out Jeremy or Steve!"

736
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:54,228
We three have to take Monica out
by surprise.

737
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,379
Monica... I don't know what she's doing.

738
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:03,432
Why tell Kimmi
to keep the girls?

739
00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:04,954
Why do that ?

740
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:09,410
So it would be cool to see
Monica walk away after that.

741
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:12,379
I would just like to mention the fact

742
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,846
that sends a negative signal
to Bayon to eliminate a Bayon.

743
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,162
She will be the first Bayon eliminated.

744
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:22,606
I'm terrified of the idea
of ​​a change of tribes.

745
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:23,776
I know it.

746
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,959
Jeremy, Kimmi and I
have to decide tonight

747
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:27,593
in which direction to go.

748
00:34:27,718 --> 00:34:31,198
It could have
a lasting impact on the game.

749
00:34:31,323 --> 00:34:32,671
If he sorts Monica,

750
00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:34,949
we betray the old Bayon,
our original tribe.

751
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,738
So who knows what will happen
in case of change or merger?

752
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:40,107
It could violate
many bonds of trust.

753
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:41,475
In one way,

754
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,244
Monica and Wigglesworth
pose the same risk.

755
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:47,815
We can't trust Monica.
She will betray anything that moves.

756
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,647
And Wigglesworth
has many connections to Ta Keo.

757
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:52,786
Eliminating it now
would make a lot of sense.

758
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:56,023
It is difficult to establish
which is the most dangerous.

759
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:21,300
For those of you
who don't have a torch,

760
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:23,350
grab one
and light it in the fire.

761
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:29,899
It is part
of the council ritual,

762
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,856
because the fire represents your life.

763
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:34,136
If your fire goes away, so do you.

764
00:35:36,563 --> 00:35:37,565
Fishbach.

765
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,467
Counseling
can benefit a tribe.

766
00:35:40,592 --> 00:35:44,113
Monica brought it up to the test,
it can solidify a tribe.

767
00:35:44,238 --> 00:35:46,840
Do you have this impression
that it could be positive?

768
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:48,751
This game is based on trust.

769
00:35:48,876 --> 00:35:50,678
You can't prove trust

770
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:52,888
before voting on the board.

771
00:35:53,745 --> 00:35:54,748
Monica,

772
00:35:54,873 --> 00:35:56,570
the most obvious, a priori,

773
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:59,675
would be that the four old Bayon,

774
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,855
Kimmi, Stephen, Jeremy and yourself,

775
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:05,034
just have to choose
between Wigglesworth and Spencer.

776
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:08,662
Is it the dominant feeling
that the allies must stick together?

777
00:36:09,112 --> 00:36:10,197
I think so.

778
00:36:11,465 --> 00:36:13,976
It's also mostly
based on trust

779
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:16,432
and on the loyalty
that we feel towards certain people.

780
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:17,780
Wigglesworth.

781
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:20,607
Was that your impression today?
Is it you or Spencer?

782
00:36:20,732 --> 00:36:21,909
Absolutely.

783
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:23,410
And my actions

784
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:25,646
since we've been together

785
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:28,278
will take me, I hope,
until tomorrow morning,

786
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,207
and I will remain with this tribe.

787
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:32,986
Jeremy, is that the mark
of an old school player?

788
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:37,124
Because what Kelly says is actually
quite wise and full of common sense.

789
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:39,593
Yes, that makes sense.
But that's old school.

790
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:41,736
The new school is more erratic.

791
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:44,200
"I need it now,
I need to know if I am.

792
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:48,468
I will do my best
to hold out until the next day."

793
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:50,279
Spencer, that's you.

794
00:36:50,404 --> 00:36:54,193
You embody the new school.
Erratic, game expert,

795
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:55,676
always thoroughly.

796
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:57,244
Yeah, you could say that.

797
00:36:57,576 --> 00:36:59,355
And I here, for the first time

798
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,295
in my career in Survivor,

799
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,084
the very first time
i have a close knit tribe

800
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:07,463
with which I feel good
to face the tests

801
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:08,829
and play as a team.

802
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:12,092
Because this game is still tribal,
it is not yet individual.

803
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:14,682
And I've never experienced this before.

804
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:18,107
Based on that, I say,
"This is my group."

805
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:21,544
Jeremy, looking to the long term,

806
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,504
it is sweet music
to your ears.

807
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:25,995
Yes, that's good to hear
for the long haul.

808
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,307
And also, with Kelly,

809
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,829
she is loyal, hardworking,

810
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:32,313
it is also positive
for the future of the group.

811
00:37:32,438 --> 00:37:34,848
Jeremy, what will
tonight's vote be based on?

812
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,693
loyalty, trust,

813
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:39,386
strength in trials...

814
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:42,840
So far, nothing to decide between
Spencer and Wigglesworth.

815
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:44,800
Both are strong
in trials

816
00:37:44,925 --> 00:37:46,375
and pledged their loyalty.

817
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,860
Well, we'll see.

818
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:51,865
Et Kimmi,

819
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,877
another thing
to consider in this vote,

820
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:58,405
this is the type of signal sent
to the other candidates still in play.

821
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:02,585
The ten original Bayons
were tightly knit.

822
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:07,730
As long as they see
that it's one of the ex-Ta Keo,

823
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:08,916
Everything will be alright.

824
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,251
But no one knows
what is happening on the camp.

825
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,922
Monica, is this vote locked?

826
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:17,154
Yes I think so.

827
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:22,545
Kimmi, is it hard
to eliminate someone?

828
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,616
Or is it rather exciting:

829
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:26,692
"I really play!" ?

830
00:38:26,817 --> 00:38:29,570
It sucks to end
someone's hopes and dreams.

831
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,871
But I have to go beyond
the emotional aspect.

832
00:38:32,996 --> 00:38:35,004
I came
knowing it was a game.

833
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:37,623
I will continue
to follow my path.

834
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,314
Stephen, does emotion play
a role in voting for you?

835
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:42,852
Or is it just the strategy,
getting to the end,

836
00:38:42,977 --> 00:38:44,548
and this time, I will win?

837
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:46,553
The strategy is based on emotion.

838
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:49,231
You have to build real connections

839
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:50,991
to build real alliances.

840
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:56,330
Good. It's time to vote.

841
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:58,152
Monica, over to you.

842
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:08,208
I hate writing your name.

843
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:11,829
But you would do wonders
if we let you go further.

844
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:22,198
Sorry, Spence.
You are a brave guy,

845
00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:24,525
but I have to follow the majority
on this one.

846
00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:35,983
You coined the phrase:

847
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,105
"I didn't come here
to make friends."

848
00:39:38,468 --> 00:39:41,417
And yet,
you have more than me in front of you.

849
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:45,745
I hope I have convinced
this tribe that it is.

850
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:58,826
I will count the votes.

851
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,904
If anyone has an immunity idol
and wants to play it,

852
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:12,906
now is the time to do it.

853
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,119
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

854
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:21,557
The eliminated person
will leave the council immediately.

855
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:22,924
I will read the votes.

856
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,353
First vote:

857
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:28,631
Kelly.

858
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:31,933
Spencer.

859
00:40:34,228 --> 00:40:35,829
Kelly. Two Kelly votes.

860
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:42,072
Monica.

861
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:45,005
Two Kelly votes,
one Spencer vote, one Monica vote.

862
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:49,243
Monica.

863
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:51,687
That's two votes Monica,

864
00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:53,417
two Kelly votes, one Spencer vote,

865
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,682
one vote remains.

866
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:59,879
Fifth person eliminated
from Survivor Second Chance...

867
00:41:01,013 --> 00:41:02,122
Monica.

868
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:03,724
Bring me your torch.

869
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,974
Monica, the tribe has spoken.

870
00:41:26,513 --> 00:41:28,026
It's time to go.

871
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:35,556
If we were to wonder again

872
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:39,493
whether this tribe is playing
old school or new school,

873
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:42,641
this surprise
elimination removes all doubt.

874
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,532
Take your torches,
return to camp.

875
00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:45,666
Good night.

Stay with us, to see

881
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:05,492
Next time in Survivor...

882
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:08,547
Big hits
are all about timing.

883
00:42:08,672 --> 00:42:10,088
- You kidding.
- Think about it.

884
00:42:10,213 --> 00:42:11,857
It could be the hit

885
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:14,092
which would set the tone
for the entire season.

886
00:42:14,217 --> 00:42:16,408
But the presence
of one of the Survivors in the game

887
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,207
is about to end.

888
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:20,382
It's worse
than you could imagine.

889
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:21,604
Alright, c'est Probst!

890
00:42:22,398 --> 00:42:24,482
I'm a little shocked, but that's okay.

891
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:26,845
I really wanted to stay
much longer.

892
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,016
I didn't expect
to come out so soon.

893
00:42:29,141 --> 00:42:30,805
You never know what to expect.

894
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,965
I was officially
eliminated by surprise.

895
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,433
My second chance
is a little disappointing.

896
00:42:35,558 --> 00:42:38,028
I don't know what I
could have done otherwise.

897
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:40,191
It's hard, but it's a game.

898
00:42:40,316 --> 00:42:42,514
You have to recover
after being eliminated.
