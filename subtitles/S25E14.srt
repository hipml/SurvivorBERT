TOUGHEST, AND MOST DANGEROUS

3
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:14,472

IT.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,934
>> OH!

>> Jeff: EACH HAD BEEN

9
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,062
MEDICALLY EVACUATED FROM THEIR

>> I GOT INJURED IN A CHALLENGE.

00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,280
>> THE INFECTION GOES INTO YOUR

15
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,157
BLOODSTREAM IS POTENTIALLY

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:32,365
FATAL.

17
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,616
>> IT WAS AWFUL.

>> THE WORLD THOUGHT ME FALLING

21
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,166
IN THE FIRE WAS MY GREATEST

22
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,417
FAILURE.

23
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,419
I DIDN'T SEE IT THAT WAY BUT I'M

24
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,712
IN LOVE WITH THE FACT THAT I'M

25
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,213
ABLE TO COME OUT HERE AND DO IT

26
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:47,422

>> THE LAST TIME I PLAYED

30
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,056
"SURVIVOR" IT SMACKED ME IN THE

31
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,265
CHOPS.

32
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,308
THIS TIME I'M SMACKING BACK.

33
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,685

RETURNING PLAYERS, THE CASTAWAYS

SUPER FANS, FORMER BASEBALL STAR

37
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:06,483
JEFF KENT.

38
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,150
>> I PLAYED IN THE WORLD SERIES

39
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,527
WITH BASES LOADED.

40
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:09,986
I'VE SEEN PRESSURE.

41
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,279
THIS IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE

42
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,655
FOR ME, NO DOUBT.

43
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,239
AND I'M HOPING PEOPLE WON'T

44
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,699
RECOGNIZE ME.

45
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,285
>> Jeff: AND FORMER TEEN TV

46
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,745
STAR LISA.

>> I PLAYED BLAIR WARNER ON "THE

48
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,123
FACTS OF LIFE."

49
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,291
BLAIR WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION

50
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,335
YEARS BE ON "SURVIVOR," BUT I'M

51
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,586
VERY, VERY DIFFERENT, AND AT

52
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,379
THIS POINT I'M GETTING TO BE

53
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,130
JUST LISA.

54
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,423
>> Jeff: FROM THE BEGINNING

55
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,716
THESE THREE TRIBES WERE HIT BY A

56
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,926
STORM THAT LASTED 21 DAYS.

57
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,302
>> COME ON, RAIN, STOP.

58
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,889
>> Jeff: THE RAIN NEVER LET

59
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,056
UP.

60
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,557
FOOD SOURCE WERE SCARCE.

61
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,893
>> I DO DO ANYTHING FOR FOOD

62
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,769
RIGHT NOW.

63
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,020
AT LEAST GIVE ME HOPE.

64
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,480
>> Jeff: AND TO MAKE MATTERS

65
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,398
WORSE-- MALCOLM AND DENISE STILL

66
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,945
STRUG LING OUT IN THE WATER.

67
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,404
MAT SING NEVER WON A CHALLENGE.

68
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,989
AFTER FOUR LOSSES IN A ROW.

69
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,367
>> I DON'T GET WHAT'S HAPPENING,

70
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:57,575
FARTHER.

71
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,745
>> Jeff: THE FIRST RETURNING

72
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,164
PLAYER WAS SENT HOME.

73
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,583
MALCOLM AND DENISE-- YOU'RE DOWN

74
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,252
TO TWO, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT

75
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,004
TO DO-- WERE THE ONLY ONE TO

76
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:10,421
SURVIVE.

77
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,214
THE UNLIKELY DUOHAD BEEN IN AN

78
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,341
ALLIANCE SINCE DAY ONE.

79
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:17,345
>> INSTANTLY, WE JUST CLICKED.

80
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,848
>> Jeff: AND WERE INSEPARABLE

81
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,266
UNTIL THE GAME SPLIT THEM UP.

82
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,227
MAT SING HAS BEEN DECIMATED.

83
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,228
MAT SING IS NO MORE.

84
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,896
WE HAVE TWO TRIBES NOW.

85
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,315
MALCOLM GOES TO TANDANG.

86
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,567
DENISE GOES TO KALABAW.

87
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,652
>> I'M STILL HOLDING THAT TRUST

88
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,612
THAT IT'S MALCOLM AND I, AND THE

89
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,363
TIME COMES I GO BACK WITH

90
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:35,572
MALCOLM.

91
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,700
>> Reporter: AT TANDANG, LISA

92
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,826
WAS DISCOVERING THE REAL FACTS

93
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,201
OF LIFE.

94
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,870
>> IT'S HARD BEING ON THE

95
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,078
OUTSIDE.

96
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,955
MAYBE I'M NOT ABLE TO PLAY THIS

97
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:44,163
GAME.

98
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,456
>> Jeff: SHE STRUGGLED TO FIT

99
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,499
IN WITH HER YOUNG TRIBE.

100
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,001
>> SHE'S JUST, LIKE, AN

101
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:48,251
OUTSIDER.

102
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,753
>> I DON'T TRUST HER.

103
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,005
SHE'S A SMART PLAYER.

104
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,756
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE LISA.

105
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,050
>> Jeff: AND HER ONLY BOND WAS

106
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:56,467
WITH SKUPIN.

107
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,428
>> LISA IS MY CLOSEST ALLY OUT

108
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:58,595
HERE.

109
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,847
>> YOU WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO

110
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,639
THINK I WOULD LIE TO YOU.

111
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,182
>> I AM YOUR FRIEND.

112
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,183
>> ME TOO.

113
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,476
>> BUT IF YOU ( BLEEP ) WITH ME,

114
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,145
YOU'RE DEAD.

115
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,230
>> ANY CHAOS I CREATE IS GOING

116
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,982
TO BE BENEFICIAL TO ME.

117
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:11,691
>>UN WHAT YOU DID?

118
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,192
>> I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

119
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,485
>> STOP, DON'T EVEN TRY.

120
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,822
>> SHUT-- SHUT UP.

121
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,616
>> Jeff: WINNING WAS THE ONLY

122
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,284
THING THAT KEPT TANDANG FROM

123
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:21,910
FALL APART.

124
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,244
AND LISA DONE DOES IT!

125
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,330
TANDANG WINS!

126
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:30,084
TAN BANG WINS IMMUNITY BY

127
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,044
SECONDS!

PENNER.

132
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,927
>> DO WE WANT A VETERAN TO WIN

133
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,094
OR DO WE WANT ONE OF US TO WIN?

134
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,346
>> I AGREE.

135
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,140
>> Jeff: BUT PENNER'S IDOL AND

136
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:44,807
EXPERIENCE IN THE GAME KEPT HIM

137
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:44,974
ALIVE.

138
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,227

IDOL.

140
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,520
I'M GOING TO DANCE ALL THE WAY

FINALLY MADE THEIR ALLIANCE

153
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,083
THESE TWO ALLIANCES CAME

154
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:10,333

WITH SOMEONE WHO REALLY DOESN'T

00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:33,231
TRUST ME.

171
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,358

YOU'RE PULLING YOURSELF OUT OF

173
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:36,693
THE GAME?

174
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,027
>> I CAN'T STAY HERE.

175
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,570

GO AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT'S

STAGE OF THE GAME MEANS NOTHING

204
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,171
TO ME.

THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE THIS

208
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,052

DETERMINED WOMAN.

216
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,857
THE TASTE OF BLOOD IS IN THE

217
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,066
WATER.

218
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,525
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

HERE.

226
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,370
THERE'S NO REASON TO HOLD BACK

227
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:11,746
ANY MORE.

228
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,580
WE'RE IN THE HOME STRETCH.

229
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,375
IT'S GO BIG OR GO HOME TIME FOR

OR EACH OTHER?

239
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,639
IT ALL COMES TO AN END TONIGHT.

240
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,309
FIND OUT WHO WILL CLAIM THE

241
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,393

>> OH, DON'T YOU?

247
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,018
>> THAT'S LIKE HAVING A TUMOR

248
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:57,226
REMOVED.

249
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:57,602
>> IT WAS.

250
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:57,935
NEGATIVE GONE.

251
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,188

READY?

00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,612
BEST FEELING I'VE HAD SINCE I'VE

256
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:07,945
BEEN OUT HERE.

257
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,406
IT SUCKED LIFE OUT OF YOU HAVING

258
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,741
HER HERE.

259
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,201
I HAVE NEVER MET ANYBODY LIKE

260
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:13,701
THAT BEFORE.

261
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,913
I MEAN, I'M NOT HAPPY FOR HER

262
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,079
LOSS.

263
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,581
I'M JUST HAPPY FOR OUR PEACE.

264
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,167
>> SHE WAS JUST FULL OF FIRE.

265
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,627
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I'D CALL IT

266
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,835
FIRE.

267
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,838
>> FULL OF...

268
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,297
SOMETHING.

269
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,798
>> ON THE ONE HAND IT'S A REALLY

270
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,633
GOOD THING THAT ABI IS GONE.

271
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,635
THE BAD NEWS IS SHE WENT OUT

272
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,969
WITH A BANG.

273
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,429
WHENEVER SOMEBODY WANTS TO GO

274
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:34,514
OUT WITH A BANG IN THIS GAME

275
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,475
THEY TEND TO THROW ME UNDER THE

276
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,143
BUS WITH COMPLILTS OF ALL

277
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:39,644
THINGS.

278
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,895
"MALCOLM WILL DEFINITELY WIN THE

279
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:41,437
GAME.

280
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,813
MALCOLM IS A LOCK IF HE GETS TO

281
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,689
THE END."

282
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,607
I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO BE

283
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,650
NICE BUT THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE

284
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,361
CONTROL I HAVE TO KEEP DOING

285
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,404
AFTER SOMEONE BLOWS UP AT TRIBAL

286
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,781
COUNCIL IS GETTING RIDICULOUS.

287
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,200
>> NOTHING'S CHANGED SINCE TWO

288
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:54,992
WEEKS AGO.

289
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,619
>> SO NO MATTER WHAT, IT'S ME

290
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,039
AND YOU TOMORROW?

291
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,876
>> MALCOLM AND I HAVE A

292
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,460
"SURVIVOR" ALLIANCE, BUT THE

293
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,796
DECISION I HAVE TO MAKE FOR THE

294
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,048
END GAME STRATEGY HAS TO BE WHO

295
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,175
I WANT TO SIT NEXT TO IN THE

296
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,635
FINAL THREE.

297
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,803
THERE IS A FEELING THAT

298
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,472
MALCOLM'S THE RUNAWAY.

299
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,765
ABI SEES IT THAT WAY.

300
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,267
LISA SEES IT THAT WAY.

301
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,601
I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

302
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,769
I BELIEVE I HAVE A BETTER STORY

303
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,272
THAN HE HAS.

304
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,857
I HAVE TO STEP OUTSIDE THE GAME

305
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,027
FOR JUST A MINUTE AND LOOK AT IT

306
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,612
FROM AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER IN

307
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,823
ORDER TO TRULY MAKE THE DECISION

308
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:42,915
ON THAT.

309
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,303
>> TREE MAIL!

310
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:55,845
WE GOT SOMETHING GOING ON.

311
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,014
>> WOW!

312
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,307
>> OKAY.

313
00:09:59,390 --> 00:09:59,974
OH, NO.

314
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:00,850
>> UH-OH.

315
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,058
>> WHAT?

316
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,103
>> NO WAY.

317
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,396
"WINNING THIS SEX CHALLENGE WILL

318
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,524
BE WORTHY OF YOUR BRAGIN'.

319
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,735
WE'LL HAVE A BETTER SHOT AT THE

320
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,446
MONEY WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED OFF

321
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,488
THE DRAGON."

322
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,990
IS THAT REWARD OR IMMUNITY?

323
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,116
>> WE NEVER KNOW.

324
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:17,491
>> NO.

325
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,951
>> OH, WE HAVE A CHALLENGE TODAY

326
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
WHICH WE WEREN'T EXPECTING.

327
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,871
MY FEAR IS I WILL BE THE NEXT

328
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,788
ONE TO GO.

329
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,458
WE'VE HAD THIS SOLID FOUR BUT

330
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,126
FOUR CAINT GO TO THREE SO I AM

331
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,127
DESPERATE TO WIN IT BECAUSE ONE

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:28,878
OF US IS GOING TO GET THE SHORT

333
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,881
END OF THE STICK, AND I

334
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,799
DEFINITELY DON'T WANT IT TO BE

335
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,802
ME.

336
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:58,949
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

337
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,160

344
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:10,419
EXCITING.

COLLECTING BAGS ALONG THE WAY.

ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE BAGS,

355
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,603
YOU WILL USE THE PIECES TO SOLVE

356
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,606
A DRAGON PUZZLE.

357
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,232
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,360
BECAUSE I KNOW I'M BEING AWFUL.

567
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,570
>> I TRIED TO APPROACH MALCOLM

568
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,364
ABOUT GOING TO THEIFIABLE FINAL

569
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,241
THREE TOGETHER, AND HE'S JUST

570
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,283
VERY HESITANT TO MAKE ANY KIND

571
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,327
OF COMMITMENT, SO FOR ME,

572
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,496
KNOWING HE HAD PLANNED SO HARD

573
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,289
TO MAKE SURE WE HAD A SIX, AND

574
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,166
PLANNED TOW HARD TO MAKE SURE WE

575
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,628
HAD A FOUR, MAKES ME VERY LEERY

576
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,629
ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS ON KEEPING ME

577
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,463
IN THE FINAL THREE.

578
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,090
SO THIS IS KIND OF SCRAMBLE

579
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:53,298
TIME.

580
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,092
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN AND

581
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,345
FIGURE IT OUT FAST.

582
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,307
>> I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN

583
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,976
OPPORTUNITY JUST TO TALK TO

584
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:04,810
EITHER OF YOU.

585
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:08,021
AND SO I WANTED TO FEEL YOU

586
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,523
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE

587
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,941
MALCOLM'S HEAD IS.

588
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,568
I'M GETTING FLASH BACKS TO

589
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:12,776
PENNER.

590
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,903
LIKE, "MALCOLM, ARE YOU ABLE TO

591
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,114
MAKE ANY COMMITMENT FOR FINAL

592
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:17,698
THREE?"

593
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,365
"WE'VE GOT TIME.

594
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,408
WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT

595
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,201
THAT YET, JUNGLE MOM."

596
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,579
AND I'M LIKE, THAT'S ALL I NEED

597
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:23,996
TO KNOW.

598
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,331
>> I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR YOU

599
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,082
TALKING LIKE THIS.

600
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,250
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LIKE THIS--

601
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,627
>> WE HAVE BEEN BUT

602
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,253
STRATEGICALLY HE HAS VOTES ALL

603
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,088
OVER THE JURY.

604
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,674
HE HAS THE PHYSICAL GAME.

605
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,177
HE HAS THE SOCIAL GAME.

606
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,429
IF YOU GUYS ARE ON BOARD, IT IS

607
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:40,679
POSSIBLE.

608
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,180
>> PERFECT.

609
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,307
TODAY HAS BEEN A GOOD DAY.

610
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,058
I JUST FOUND OUT DENISE IS

611
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,310
WILLING TO TURN ON MALCOLM AND

612
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,062
GO TO THE FINAL THREE WITH MIKE

613
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:49,646
AND ME.

614
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,815
SHE REALIZES SHE DOESN'T HAVE A

615
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,275
CHANCE AGAINST HIM.

616
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,568
NONE OF US DO.

617
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,988
SO THIS IS FABULOUS.

618
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,740
MALCOLM IS THE KIND OF GUY WHO

619
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,950
WILL PUT HIS ARM AROUND YOU, AND

620
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:02,201
STAB YOU.

621
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:02,701
>> STAB YOU.

622
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,536
>> THEN VISIT YOU AT THE

623
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,245
HOSPITAL THE NEXT DAY.

624
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,497
AND YOU GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL

625
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,918
AND SAYING, "WAS THAT THE

626
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,461
SWEETEST THING FOR HIM TO COME

627
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:12,628
VISIT.

628
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,087
HE'S SUCH A NICE GUY!

629
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:14,546
>> ABSOLUTELY.

630
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,673
WE ALL HAVE BETTER ODDS TOGETHER

631
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,299
UP THERE VERSUS LET'S JUST LET

632
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,467
HIM DO A CLEAN SWEEP.

633
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,635
>> YEAH.

634
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,218
>> OKAY.

635
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:20,636
>> ABSOLUTELY.

636
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:20,844
>> OKAY.

637
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,929
>> OH!

638
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,014
>> SO GLOOD TO HEAR YOU THINKING

639
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:24,723
LIKE THIS.

640
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,474
I HUGGED HER, BIG HUG.

641
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,976
DIDN'T SHAKE HER HAND.

642
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,227
DIDN'T GIVE HER MY WORD BECAUSE

643
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,646
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SKUPIN IS

644
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:37,402
GOING TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

645
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,321
>> SO I TALKED TO LISA AND I'M

646
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,282
VOTING FOR MALCOLM.

647
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:42,491
100%.

648
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,325
>> REALLY?

649
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,536
YEAH, SHE'S LIKE, "I'M SO

650
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:46,828
RELIEVED."

651
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,789
ALL RIGHT, I JUST WANT TO GO

652
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,623
COOL OFF AND CLEAN UP.

653
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,332
>> YEAH, ENJOY.

654
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:50,582
>> I WILL.

655
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,127
THANK YOU!

656
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,755
>> DENISE WAS THRILLED WITH YOUR

657
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,089
CONVERSATION.

658
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:57,506
>> GREAT, ME, TOO.

659
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,384
YOU AND I NEED TO GET OFF AND

660
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,635
DECIDE DEFINITELY WHICH WAY WE

661
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,970
WANT TO GO.

662
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,846
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT, I'M

663
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,472
LEANING TOWARDS GOING TO THE END

664
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,015
WITH DENISE.

665
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,935
>> LISA AND I HAVE A PACT WITH

666
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,019
MALCOLM TO GO INTO THE FINAL

667
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,188
THREE TOGETHER, BUT NOW IT LOOKS

668
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,233
LIKE WE HAVE THE SAME DEAL WITH

669
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,485
DENISE, WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE

670
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,903
EITHER WAY LISA IS I WILL BE IN

671
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,530
THE FINAL THREE WITH ONE OF

672
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,366
THOSE TWO, DEPENDING ON WHO WINS

673
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:24,616
IMMUNITY.

674
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,368
IF SHE WINS TOMORROW, THEN WHAT?

675
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,079
>> I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE A

676
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,455
SCENARIO WHERE MALCOLM DOESN'T

677
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:30,789
WIN IMMUNITY.

678
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,624
>> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS

679
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,125
THINKING?

680
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,460
IN THE PHYSICAL CHALLENGE I BEAT

681
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,087
MALCOLM TODAY TO THE PUZZLE.

682
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,089
I BEAT HIM IN EVERY PHYSICAL

683
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:39,381
CHALLENGE.

684
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,091
SO I CAN BEAT HIM.

685
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,884
I'M NOT SAYING I WILL.

686
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,261
I'M SAYING I THINK I CAN BEAT

687
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:44,428
HIM.

688
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,846
YOU KNOW, THE WORD ON THE STREET

689
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,681
IS MALCOLM'S UNBEATABLE, AND HE

690
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,432
MAKES IT TO THE FINAL THREE,

691
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,935
IT'S A LANDSLIDE, HE'LL GET

692
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:52,227
EVERY VOTE.

693
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,561
I DON'T KNOW.

694
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,230
I THINK I CAN BEAT MALCOLM.

695
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:57,315
AND I THINK I CAN TELL A PRETTY

696
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,859
GOOD STORY AT THE END.

697
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,570
SO I JUST HAVE TO KEEP MY COOL

698
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,239
AND FIGURE OUT WHO I WANT TO SIT

699
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,867
NEXT TO IN THE FINALLY BECAUSE

700
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,993
THAT'S THE MILLION-DOLLAR

701
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,244
QUESTION RIGHT THERE.

702
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,350
A CRAZY DAY.

703
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,977
DENISE IS REALLY WORKING IT,

704
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:34,311
RIGHT?

705
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,522
WE CAN'T CONTROL JURY VOTES BUT

706
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,608
WE CAN CONTROL WHERE WE SIT.

707
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,443
SO WE JUST CAN'T LET HER WIN.

708
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,570
SHE HASN'T WON ANYTHING--

709
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,614
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE CAN'T LET

710
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,240
HER WIN.

711
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:47,741
WE HAVE TO LET HER WIN.

712
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,160
SHE'S THE ONE WE HAVE A BETTER

713
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:50,577
CHANCE OF BEATING.

714
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,537
SHE HASN'T PLAYED THE GAME.

715
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,916
SHE LET MALCOLM PLAY FOR HER.

716
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,960
I USED TO HATE IT WHEN ABI SAID

717
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,629
I NEED TO KEEP MIKEOLE A LEASH

718
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,630
BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO BE LEVEL

719
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,174
HEADED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

720
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,134
STRATEGIC MOVES, AND SOMETIMES

721
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,803
SKUPIN IS NOT THAT LEVEL HEADED.

722
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,596
>> REALISTICALLY, WE CAN'T LET

723
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,097
EITHER ONE OF THEM WIN.

724
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,181
>> RIGHT.

725
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,391
>> THEN WE CONTROL THE OUTCOME

726
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,184
OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FINAL

727
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:14,601
PART OF THE GAME.

728
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,894
>> RIGHT.

729
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,771
>> LISA AND I ARE NOT ON THE

730
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,149
SAME PAGE AS FAR AS WHO SITS IN

731
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,484
THE FINAL THREE, AND WHO THAT

732
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,652
LAST PERSON IS ON THE JURY.

733
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,445
SO IF I WANT TO CONTROL THE

734
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,156
OUTCOME OF THE GAME, I HAVE TO

735
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,659
HAVE IMMUNITY IN MY HAND SO I

736
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,410
CAN CREATE THE FINAL THREE

737
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,495
INSTEAD OF JUST FALLING INTO THE

738
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,664
FINAL THREE.

739
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,292
>> TREE MAIL.

740
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,169
>> "CONGRATULATIONS FINAL FOUR.

741
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:41,670
YOU ARE ALMOST AT THE END.

742
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,589
FOLLOW THE MAP TO THE HEAD LAND.

743
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,174
THERE YOU WILL FIND THE TORCHES

744
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,051
OF YOUR FALLEN COMRADES.

745
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,596
AT EACH TORCH YOU WILL CLCT A

746
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,390
REPRESENTATIVE NAME PLATE OF

747
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,016
THOSE VOTED OUT BEFORE YOU, PAIK

748
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,352
RESPECT TO EACH THEIR MEMORIES

749
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,311
AS THEY EACH HAD A PART IN

750
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,689
GETTING YOU TO THIS POINT.

751
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,191
YOU WILL THEN HEAD TO YOUR FINAL

752
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:03,775
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE."

753
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,485
>> THAT'S A FUN DAY.

754
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:05,735
VERY COOL.

755
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,698
>> THAT'S A BIG ONE.

756
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,367
TREE MAIL WAS BIGGER THAN USUAL.

757
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,161
WE ARE GOING TO DO THE FALLEN

758
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:14,744
COMRADES TODAY, WHERE YOU PAY

759
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,997
RESPECTS TO EVERYONE WHO HAS

760
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,123
FALLEN BEFORE YOU IN THE GAME.

761
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:18,707
IT'S A COOL THING TO TAKE THE

762
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,376
TIME AND GO REMEMBER THEM ONE

763
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,420
LAST TIME BEFORE THE BLOOD

764
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,672
STARTS FLOWING TONIGHT.

765
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,132
>> ZANE.

766
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:27,591
WAS A CRAZY GUY.

767
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,676
HE QUIT SMOKING DAYS BEFORE HE

768
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,471
CAME OUT HERE, GAINED 30 POUNDS,

769
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,097
WAS ALSO ONE OF THE FUNNIEST

770
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:34,306
GUYS.

771
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,600
>> APPEARED TO BE A LITTLE

772
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,268
INSANE.

773
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:38,643
PUT IT THAT WAY.

774
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,520
>> I THINK IT WAS VERY STUPID

775
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,440
FOR MY TRIBE TO VOTE ME OUT.

776
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,816
THAT MADE A MOVE WAY TOO EARLY

777
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,609
IN THE GAME.

778
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,528
IN HINDSIGHT, YOU KNOW HINDSIGHT

779
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,571
IS 20-20.

780
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,491
AS YOU CAN SEE, MY WHOLE TRIBE

781
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,411
FOLDED AFTER I LEFT.

782
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,122
>> OH, ROXY.

783
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,957
I THINK ROX WOULD HAVE TO BE ONE

784
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,293
OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE STRONGEST

785
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:03,919
CONVICTIONS ABOUT HER BELIEFS

786
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,837
THAT I HAVE EVER KNOWN.

787
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,755
>> SHE WAS A FIGHTER.

788
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,380
SHE WAS A FIGHTER.

789
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,757
>> I KEEP IT REAL AND THAT COULD

790
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,134
HAVE BEEN MY DOWNFALL, KEEPING

791
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,636
IT REAL TOO MUCH GETS YOU OUT

792
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,678
SOMETIMES, BUT I WAS JUST

793
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:19,100
MYSELF, AND I'M PROUD OF IT.

794
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,560
>> OH, ANGIE.

795
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,772
( LAUGHTER ).

796
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,066
ANGIE WAS MY SLEEPING BUDDY.

797
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,192
YOU KNOW WHAT?

798
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:27,734
SHE TURNED OUT TO BE A LOT

799
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,819
TOUGHER THAN WE ALL JUDGED HER

800
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,028
TO BE.

801
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,780
POOR GIRL, ALL SHE WANTED WAS

802
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,365
SOME COOKIES.

803
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,243
>> A GIRL AFTER MY OWN HEART!

804
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,703
>> BEING DITSY OR BUBBLY,

805
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,329
WHATEVER.

806
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:39,955
THAT'S JUST PART OF WHO I AM.

807
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,833
I'M NOT A DUMB BLOND BUM I'M NOT

808
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,877
SERIOUS ALL THE TIME OR HARD

809
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,086
CORE.

810
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,256
I'M KIND OF WELL-ROUNDED, I FEEL

811
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,425
LIKE.

812
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,510
>> RUSSELL.

813
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,761
UN, THE LEADER, CAME IN SAYING,

814
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,555
"I DON'T WANT TO BE THE LEADER,

815
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,474
GUYS," BUT HE JUST COULDN'T HELP

816
00:25:59,557 --> 00:25:59,641
IT.

817
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,227
HE WANTED TO WIN THIS GAME SO

818
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,394
BAD.

819
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,145
>> A COG TAIJOUS ENEMY AROUND

820
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:04,354
CAMP.

821
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:04,854
>> AND HE WAS THE FIRST

822
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,314
RETURNING PLAYER TO GO.

823
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,732
>> I CAME BACK OUT HERE TO WIN

824
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,024
THIS THING.

825
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,734
HOWEVER, WE GOT OUR BUTTS

826
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:14,072
KICKED, WORST TRIBE EVER IN THE

827
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,659
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY AND TO GO OUT

828
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:22,914
FOUR STRAIGHT HUMILIATIONS.

829
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,209
>> DANA.

830
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,836
I THINK SHE COULD HAVE BEEN A

831
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,712
GREAT COMPETITOR, BUT HER BODY

832
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,755
JUST WOULDN'T LET HER STAY IN

833
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:30,922
IT.

834
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,384
>> I CAN SPEAK ON HER BEHALF,

835
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,344
BEING MEDEVACED FROM THIS GAME,

836
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,929
IT JUST LEAVES A LITTLE HOLE

837
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,179
INSIDE.

838
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,639
>> I DEFINITELY THINK I HAD THE

839
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,724
HEART FOR THE GAME, AND I THINK

840
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,475
AT THE END IT WAS ALL HEART, BUT

841
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,477
I JUST DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE

842
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,603
WENT ON ANY LONGER.

843
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:52,068
YOU CAN ONLY DO WHAT YOU CAN DO.

844
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,154
>> OH, DAWSON.

845
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,822
DAWSON WAS ANOTHER VERY LIVELY

846
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,781
ADDITION TO THE GAME OF

847
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,991
"SURVIVOR."

848
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:58,783
A LITTLE QUIRKY.

849
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,827
A LITTLE OUT THERE, BUT

850
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,955
DEFINITELY ENTERTAINMENT THAT I

851
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,956
THINK KALABAW NEEDED.

852
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,875
>> I PLAYED TOO PASSIVELY.

853
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,544
THAT'S MY BIGGEST REGRET.

854
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,546
BUT HAVING JEFF PROBST SNUFF MY

855
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,172
TORCH, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH

856
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,673
I WAS SALIVATING.

857
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,217
I JUST WANTED TO PUT A WET ONE

858
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,552
SO FAR UP ON HIS LIPS.

859
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,680
IT WAS A MOMENT HE AND I SHARED.

860
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:25,393
AND I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME.

861
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,771
>> KATIE, GREAT COMPETITOR.

862
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,440
WASN'T AFRAID TO STRATEGIZE.

863
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,025
A LITTLE BIT OF A POTTY MOUTH,

864
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,068
WHICH I LOVED.

865
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,111
I REALLY LIKED KATIE, BUT,

866
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,071
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE HAD TO GO SO

867
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,489
I COULD STAY.

868
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,407
SO THANK YOU, KATIE.

869
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,785
>> THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER

870
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,453
CAMPED IS WITH GIRL SCOUTS, SO

871
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,704
THE FACT THAT I STUCK IT OUT FOR

872
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:53,963
16 DAYS IS, LIKE, HUGE TO ME.

873
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,174
>> R.C., MY FIRST ALLIANCE IN

874
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,802
THE GAME, 30 SECONDS INTO THIS

875
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,763
GAME, R.C. WAS ALL OVER IT.

876
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,348
UNFORTUNATELY, THE EXTREME

877
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,849
METHODS OF HER PLAYING BECAME SO

878
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,643
OBVIOUS TO EVERYBODY, SHE

879
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,895
INSTANTLY BECAME A THREAT.

880
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,815
>> I SORT OF WAS OFTRASIGHTS

881
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,609
BECAUSE I TOOK MY CLUE AND THE

882
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,236
IDOL, AND THEN TURNED EVERYONE

883
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:16,528
AGAINST ME.

884
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,779
YOU KNOW, YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE

885
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:17,946
SOME.

886
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,157
I'M NOT REALLY USED TO LOSING.

887
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:25,745
( LAUGHS )

888
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,748
>> JEFF.

889
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,165
SORRY TO SEE HIM GO.

890
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,708
HE WAS A GOOD PLAYER.

891
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,502
>> HE WAS THE ONE THAT WANTED

892
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,128
RETURNING PLAYERS GONE THE MOST.

893
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,214
>> GREAT, GREAT ATHLETE.

894
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,383
>> I PLAYED BASEBALL WITH SOME

895
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,510
OF THE MOST SPOILED BRATS YOU

896
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,177
EVER MET.

897
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,637
MAYBE I WAS ONE OF THEM AT

898
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:42,804
TIMES.

899
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,180
BUT I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I

900
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,473
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH

901
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,891
THIS GAME WITHOUT PISSING A LOT

902
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,854
OF PEOPLE OFF.

903
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,191
>> ARTIS.

904
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,570
>> VERY, VERY LOYAL TO THE

905
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,112
TANDANG TRIBE.

906
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,781
I THINK ALMOST LOYAL TO A FAULT.

907
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,410
>> TANDANG WAS CAPABLE OF

908
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,703
LITERALLY ANNIHILATING THE OTHER

909
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,164
TWO TRIBES, SO I'M DISAPPOINTED

910
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,915
THAT MY TRIBE COULDN'T STAY

911
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,960
TOGETHER AND DO WHAT WAS TAILOR

912
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:19,382
MADE FOR US TO DO.

913
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,927
>> PETE.

914
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,513
STUCK WITH ABI THROUGH THICK AND

915
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,349
THIN, AND IT WAS THAT WHICH

916
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,351
REALLY, REALLY BIT HIM IN THE

917
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:30,977
BUTT IN THE END.

918
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,270
>> I'M DEFINITELY PROUD OF THE

919
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:32,896
GAME THEY PLAYED.

920
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,189
I WANTED TO BE IN CONTROL.

921
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,232
AND MOST OF THE GAME I WAS IN

922
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:36,733
CONTROL.

923
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,692
THE TURNING POINT IN THE GAME

924
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:40,487
WAS I KEPT ABI FOR WAY TOO LONG.

925
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,821
I REALLY DISLIKED HER FROM DAY

926
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,947
ONE, BUT SHE HAD THE IDOL.

927
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,283
I HAD TO STICK WITH HER, AND I

928
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:50,705
JUST MADE THE WRONG DECISION.

929
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:53,208
>> PENNER.

930
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,167
ENTERTAINMENT ON STEROIDS.

931
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:54,876
>> GREAT STRATEGIC PLAYER.

932
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,504
>> NOBODY WANTED TO SIT NEXT TO

933
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:57,670
HIM.

934
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:57,879
>> NO.

935
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,298
>> IN THE FIND THREE BECAUSE WE

936
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,049
KNEW HE COULD CREATE A SPEECH

937
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:01,841
THAT WOULD HAVE KNOCKED

938
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,720
EVERYONE'S SOCKS OF.

939
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,430
>> I LOVE "SURVIVOR" AND I'VE

940
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,307
BEEN ONE OF THE LUCKIEST FEW

941
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,433
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO HAVE

942
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,267
GOTTEN THREE OPPORTUNITIES TO

943
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,143
PLAY THIS.

944
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,436
I REGRET NOTHING.

945
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,063
I'VE LEFT EVERYTHING ON THE

946
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:15,230
FIELD.

947
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,315
YOU KNOW, I GAVE BLOOD, SWEAT,

948
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,066
AND TEARS FOR THIS GAME.

949
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,902
AND I HOLD MY HEAD UP HIGH AT

950
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,988
THIS POINT.

951
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,993
>> WHEN I MET CARTER, I SAW A

952
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,912
YOUNG MAN BECOME A MAN OUT HERE.

953
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,332
AND HIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND

954
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,292
HIS PERSONAL CHARACTER IS THE

955
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,043
REASON WE HAD TO WRITE HIS NAME

956
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:37,252
DOWN.

957
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,130
>> I WAS WHO I SAID I WAS.

958
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,676
I WORK HARD AND I DEVELOPED

959
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,343
SOLID RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE

960
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,302
OUT HERE.

961
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,595
IT'S UNFORTUNATE,UN, THAT IT

962
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,476
COULDN'T HAVE GOT ME FARTHER.

963
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,061
>> ABI.

964
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,896
OUR LITTLE BRAZILIAN

965
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,188
FIRECRACKER.

966
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,566
>> TUMULTUOUS AND TENACIOUS.

967
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,359
>> I'M SAY THIS FOR THE GIRL--

968
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,987
AS MUCH AS EVERYONE WANTS HER

969
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,071
GONE FOR SO LONG, TO MAKE IT TO

970
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,283
FIFTH PLACE IS PRETTY

971
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:08,575
IMPRESSIVE.

972
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,117
>> I WAS GENUINELY SURPRISED

973
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,912
THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE ME SO

974
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,121
MUCH.

975
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,540
I LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT

976
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:15,832
EXPERIENCE.

977
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,209
AND STILL WENT HOME FIGHTING AND

978
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:22,088
WITH MY HEAD UP HIGH.

979
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,311
>> ALL RIGHT.

980
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:45,278
GOT IT?

981
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:45,737
OKAY.

982
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,529
THERE IT GOES.

983
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:57,457
WATCH THE PUPPY BURN.

984
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:48,675
>> YES.

985
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,842
>> YES.

986
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,637
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

987
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:52,887
MALCOLM.

988
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:59,018
I GOTTA TAKE IT BACK.

989
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,105
FOR THE LAST TIME, IMMUNITY BACK

00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,241
ON MY GO, YOU'LL PICK UP THE

995
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,951
FIRST PIECE USING TWO HANDLES.

996
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,078
YOUR GOAL-- BALANCE A BALL ON

997
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,414
YOUR CENTER PIECE OF WOOD.

IF AT ANY POINT THE BALL FALLS

1002
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,089
OFF THE PIECE OF WOOD YOU'RE OUT

00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,048

00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:32,643
REST IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S HANDS.

1124
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,894
MALCOLM HAD AN ADVANTAGE, IT

1125
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,478
GAVE HIM A SECOND SHOT, AND IT

1126
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,105
DIDN'T MATTER.

1127
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,440
HE'S STILL THE FIRST PERSON OUT

1128
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:41,068
OF THIS CHALLENGE.

1129
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,861
ONE MINUTE LEFT.

1130
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:45,322
WE MOVE TO THE NEXT ROUND.

1131
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,532
SKUPIN VERY STEADY.

1132
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,826
LISA STEADY.

1133
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,286
DENISE STEADY.

1134
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,164
DENISE, GOOD RECOVERY.

1135
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:58,836
30 SECONDS.

1136
00:38:58,919 --> 00:38:59,879
DENISE DROPS HER BALL.

1137
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,590
DENISE IS OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.

1138
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,551
NOW WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

1139
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:11,432
10 SECONDS LEFT IN THIS ROUND.

1140
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:16,145
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

1141
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,147
YOU ARE BOTH SAFE.

1142
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,733
SET DOWN YOUR BALLS AND RELAX.

1143
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,652
SKUPIN AND LISA SURVIVE ANOTHER

1144
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,028
ROUND.

1145
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,446
MOVE ON TO ROUND THREE.

1146
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:29,116
TWO MORE BLOCKS OF WOOD HAD BEEN

1147
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,283
ADDED.

1148
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,618
IT WILL BECOME MUCH MORE

1149
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:30,910
DIFFICULT.

1150
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:36,624
>> COME ON, SKUP.

1151
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,209
>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR HANDLES,

1152
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,419

00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:40,628
LIFT.

1154
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,546
THIS CHALLENGE IS BACK ON.

1155
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,631
THIS COULD BE THE FINAL ROUND

1156
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,132
RIGHT HERE.

1157
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,968
WE ARE DOWN TO LISA AND SKUPIN

1158
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:52,014
BATTLING FOR THE FINAL IMMUNITY

1159
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:57,812
NECKLACE.

1160
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,900
30 SECONDS LEFT IN THIS ROUND.

1161
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,194
DIG DEEP RIGHT NOW.

1162
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:05,486
30 SECONDS.

1163
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,156
KEEP IT TOGETHER FOR 30 SECONDS.

1164
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,910
LISA WITH A TINY WOBBLE.

1165
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,788
LISA STARTING TO WOBBLE A LITTLE

1166
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,122
MORE.

1167
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:16,705
STILL HAVE 10 SECONDS LEFT IN

1168
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,082
THIS ROUND.

1169
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:26,465
SHE'S GOT TO HANG ON.

1170
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:31,137
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

1171
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,221
YOU'RE BOTH SAFE.

1172
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:35,975
DROP YOUR BALLS.

1173
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:36,725
NICE JOB, GUYS.

1174
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,685
>> GOOD JOB, LISA.

1175
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,602
>> Jeff: WE MOVE ON TO THE

00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,520
NEXT ROUND.

1177
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,856
WE WILL PLACE TWO MORE PIECES

1178
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,648
NOW, MAKING THIS VERY LONG, VERY

1179
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,984
TOUGH TO BALANCE.

1180
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:45,651
HERE WE GO.

1181
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,654
PICK UP YOUR HANDLES.

1182
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:55,161
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

1183
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:59,665
LIFT.

1184
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:04,753
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS BACK ON.

1185
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,589

VERY BIG DECISION AT TONIGHT'S

1189
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:12,344
TRIBAL.

1190
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:16,056
YOU WANT TO BE THE ONE IN

1191
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,265
CHARGE.

1192
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,434
YOU'RE IN A DANGER ZONE NOW.

1193
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:22,980
ANY MOVEMENT CAN KNOCK THAT BALL

1194
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:23,147
OFF.

1195
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,066
SKUPIN ADJUSTING.

1196
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,318
SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING, CHANGE

1197
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,319
SOMETHING UP.

1198
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,529
CHANGE YOUR BREATHING.

1199
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,490
CHANGE YOUR FOCUS.

1200
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,659
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT IN

1201
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:35,868
LISA.

1202
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,454
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

1203
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,122
DON'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING,

1204
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,665
NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING BUT

1205
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:41,874
THIS.

1206
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,835
THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.

1207
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,463
BALANCING THAT LITTLE BALL ON

1208
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,839
THESE PIECES OF WOOD IS ALL YOU

1209
00:41:48,923 --> 00:42:00,518
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT RIGHT

1210
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,060
NOW.

1211
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,771
LISA DROPS HER BALL.

1212
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,231
SKUPIN WINS FINAL IMMUNITY.

1213
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,690
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL

1214
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,608
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1215
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,235
AFTER RETURNING TO A GAME HE

1216
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,653
PLAYED 12 YEARS AGO.

1217
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,572
SKUPIN WILL GET A CHANCE TO

1218
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,949
FINISH WHAT HE STARTED.

1219
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:19,245
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

1220
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,705

1221
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,791

TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1225
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,469
>> I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HEAR YOU

1226
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,596
SAY THAT.

1227
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,097

00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,155

1238
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:55,990
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1239
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,783
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR HOW THIS

1240
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,534
AFTERNOON GOES.

1241
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,535

CONGRATS.

1244
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,742
>> YOU GUYS DID, OH, MY GOSH.

1245
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,035
GOOD TRY, MAN.

1246
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:41,285
YOU TRIED.

1247
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,496
>> I JUST HAVE SHAKY HANDS.

1248
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,331
THE ADVANTAGE WOULD HAVE HAD TO

1249
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,165
HAVE BEEN, "MALCOLM, YOU

1250
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,250
AUTOMATICALLY WIN" FOR ME TO PUT

1251
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:48,542
THAT OFF.

1252
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:51,128
I NEEDED TO WIN THE IMMUNITY

1253
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,088
CHALLENGE TO GUARANTEE MY SPOT

1254
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,798
FOR THE FINAL THREE BUT THE

1255
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,050
MINUTE I GET NERVOUS AROUND A

1256
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,469
GIRL OR ANYTHING MY HANDS START

1257
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,888
SHAKING AND WHEN I SAW MY HANDS

1258
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,139
SHAKING IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE

1259
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,807
AND WORSE.

1260
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,268
IT'S A DISCONCERTING SCENARIO

1261
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,854
BECAUSE MY FATE NOW RESTS WITH

1262
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:09,855
LISA AND SKUPIN.

1263
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:10,939
>> YOU BEAT HIM.

1264
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,941
>> RIGHT WHEN WE NEEDED IT.

1265
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,027
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID IT.

1266
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,695
THIS WIN MEANS I MADE TO THE

1267
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,864
VERY, VERY, VERY END.

1268
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,533
AND WHAT I'M MOST PROUD OF IS

1269
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,787
THE FACT THEY ALL SAID THE SAME

1270
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,372
THING, MALCOLM IS GOING TO WIN.

1271
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:30,626
IT TURNS OUT IT WAS NOT EVEN

1272
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:31,210
CLOSE.

1273
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:31,794
MR. SKUPIN, WELL DONE.

1274
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:36,298
>> YEAH.

1275
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:36,924
NOW THERE'S A TON OF STRATEGY.

1276
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,801
WHO DO YOU KEEP?

1277
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,177
WHO DO YOU PUT ON THE JURY?

1278
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,261
CAN YOU GET THEIR VOTE?

1279
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,888
AND IT'S UP TO ME TO MAKE THAT

1280
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:43,138
DECISION.

1281
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,641
>> WE'RE ALL COOL, YES?

1282
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,392
I'M SO SCARED.

1283
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,977
I'VE HAD A NECKLACE FOR THE PAST

1284
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:49,186
WEEK.

1285
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,106
AND I DON'T HAVE ONE.

1286
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,857
SHE'S GOING TO WANT YOU ALL TO

1287
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,274
THROW VOTES AT ME.

1288
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,943
>> SHOULD WE JUST GO ALONG WITH

1289
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,611
HER AND SAY YEAH?

1290
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,112
>> NO!

1291
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,781
>> NO, NO, I'M SAYING TO SAY IT.

1292
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:04,034
>> IF WE'RE ALL GOOD, I DON'T

1293
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:04,243
CARE.

1294
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,494
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG

1295
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,955
TIME IN THIS GAME I HAVEN'T BEEN

1296
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,248
CALLING THE SHOTS.

1297
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,208
HOPEFULLY, I'VE STRATEGIZEWELL

1298
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,210
ENOUGH TO WHERE IT DOESN'T

1299
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:13,460
MATTER.

1300
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,629
I HAVE AN OATH FROM LISA AND

1301
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,464
SKUPIN THAT THEY'RE WITH ME,

1302
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,882
THAT DENISE IS GOING HOME.

1303
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,884
BUT PEOPLE ARE OUT HERE PLAYING

1304
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,302
A GAME FOR A MILLION DOLLARS,

1305
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,138
AND IF THEY GET ANY CRAZY IDEAS

1306
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,764
I COULD BE IN FOR A NASTY

1307
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:32,354
SURPRISE TONIGHT.

1308
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,819
>> IS THIS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

1309
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,529
I'M STILL ON BOARD.

1310
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:40,946
ARE WE STILL GOOD?

1311
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,865
>> IT'S REALLY.

1312
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,283
MEESE LEASA AND I ARE TIGHT,

1313
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:44,491
RIGHT.

1314
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:44,741
>> I KNOW.

1315
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,743
>> AND IT'S OUR DECISION BETWEEN

1316
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,494
YOU AND MALCOLM.

1317
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:47,828
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1318
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,663
>> SO, OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU'RE ON

1319
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,291
BOARD WITH US, THEN IT'S THREE

1320
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:52,750
TO ONE.

1321
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,709
>> THEN IT'S THREE TO ONE.

1322
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,753
>> IF WE DECIDE TO GO WITH

1323
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,088
MALCOLM, THEN, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE

1324
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:58,297
GONE.

1325
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,089
>> I'LL BE GONE.

1326
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,425
I KNOW, SO MY PLAN WILL BE

1327
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,676
MALCOLM WITH THE HOPES THAT YOU

1328
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:03,552
TWO STAY ON THAT.

1329
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,471
I MEAN, I'M 100% ON THAT.

1330
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,763
>> YOU WOULD BE SILLY.

1331
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,057
>> 100%.

1332
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:09,850
>> TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.

1333
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,185
>> I AM SO MAD.

1334
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,603
MALCOLM AND I COULD HAVE STAYED

1335
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,979
TOGETHER AND SPLIT THE VOTE,

1336
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,981
HAVE IT BE A TIE, BUT NOW THAT'S

1337
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:16,940
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

1338
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,901
SO MY HEAD IS CLEARLY ON THE

1339
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:19,234
BLOCK TONIGHT.

1340
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:24,281
>> YOU WILL WRITE MALCOLM'S NAME

1341
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:24,490
DOWN.

1342
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,741
>> IT'S GUARANTEED.

1343
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,159
THE PROBLEM IS SKUPIN IS KIND OF

1344
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:27,534
THE DREAMER GUY.

1345
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,869
HIS MIND IS GOING A THOUSAND

1346
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,413
DIFFERENT PLACES AND HE MAY NOT

1347
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,915
ALWAYS SEE THE REPERCUSSIONS.

1348
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,082
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TAKE THE

1349
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,626
BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST TO

1350
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:35,959
THE END.

1351
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,920
SO I HAVE TO FIGURE ON THE A WAY

1352
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,463
TO CONVINCE HIM THAT IT'S WORTH

1353
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,840
IT TO TAKE ME WITH THEM.

1354
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,967
I'M ONE STUBBORN, DETERMINED

1355
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:44,176
WOMAN.

1356
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,969
AND IF I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN, I'M

1357
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:52,184
GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

1358
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,228
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, DUDE?

1359
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:58,524
>> YOU KNOW, THERE'S A WEIRD,

1360
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,107
INSTINCTIVE, PRIMITIVE SIDE OF

1361
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,736
ME THAT SAYS GO AGAINST THE

1362
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:02,903
BEST.

1363
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,321
GO AGAINST THE BEST.

1364
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:04,738
GO AGAINST THE BEST.

1365
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:05,030
>> I KNOW.

1366
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,866
>> IS THERE HONOR IN BEATING

1367
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,619
MALCOLM OVER BEATING YOU OR

1368
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:10,827
LISA?

1369
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,914
IS THERE ANY HONOR IN THAT?

1370
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,083
>> I MEAN, THERE IS TO SOME

1371
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,709
EXTENT, BUT WILL IT HAPPEN?

1372
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,212
AND IS THAT A RISK THAT'S WORTH

1373
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:28,011
TAKING, KNOWING-- IF THE JURY

1374
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,429
VOTES WITH MALCOLM, IS THERE

1375
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,722
HONOR BEATING HIM?

1376
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,349
MY FEAR IS WE WON'T.

1377
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,185
>> THE OBVIOUS CHOICE IS VOTE

1378
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,103
MALCOLM OUT.

1379
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,187
THAT SEEMS LIKE THE OBVIOUS.

1380
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,981
BUT WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO

1381
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:39,898
IT, I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE MALCOLM

1382
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,900
AND BEAT HIM STRAIGHT UP MAN TO

1383
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,944
MAN, TWO WARRIORS, FOUGHT TO A

1384
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:44,111
HEAD.

1385
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,280
HE WON THREE INDIVIDUAL

1386
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:46,613
CHALLENGES.

1387
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,407
I WON THREE INDIVIDUAL

1388
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,911
CHALLENGES.

1389
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,706
WHAT A GREAT HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE

1390
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,039
THAT WOULD BE.

1391
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:56,999
>> I HAVE A RESPECT FOR THE TWO

1392
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:57,916
OF YOU.

1393
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,042
I JUST FEEL THIS FRIENDSHIP WITH

1394
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,503
YOU AND LISA.

1395
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,087
I'M GETTING ALL CHOCKED UP.

1396
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,799
I SWEAR TO GOD, IT'S NOT A PLOY.

1397
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:06,925
THIS IS NO PLOY.

1398
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,969
I REALLY CARE ABOUT BOTH OF YOU,

1399
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,804
AND WHATEVER YOU DECIDE I WILL

1400
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,139
RESPECT, WHATEVER YOU BOTH

1401
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:12,389
DECIDE.

1402
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,516
I FEEL THERE ARE FRIENDSHIPS

1403
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,059
THAT HAVE FORMED OUT HERE THAT

1404
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,352
WILL SUPERCEDE THIS GAME.

1405
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,187
MALCOLM AND I MAY HAVE HAD AN

1406
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,105
ALLIANCE, BUT THERE'S A

1407
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,023
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND A

1408
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:21,982
TRUE FRIENDSHIP.

1409
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,192
BUT THIS IS ALSO A GAME, AND YOU

1410
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,777
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST

1411
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,945
FOR YOU GUYS, BUT YOU KNOW WHERE

1412
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:27,988
I'M VOTING.

1413
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,699
>> WOW, IT'S SUCH A BIG

1414
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:30,991
DECISION.

1415
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:35,996
>> IT IS.

1416
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,626
>> I JUST HEARD YOUR COMRADE

1417
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,168
OUT, ALL THE REASONS WHY SHE

1418
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,504
SHOULD COME INSTEAD OF YOU.

1419
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,882
>> SHE'S SUCH A SWEETHEART.

1420
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,216
>> RIGHT NOW I HAVEN'T DECIDED

1421
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,052
WHO I'M GOING TO KEEP YET.

1422
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,136
I AM STRONGLY CONSIDERING

1423
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,638
KEEPING MALCOLM.

1424
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,723
YOU KNOW, MY WIFE SAID TO ME AS

1425
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,059
I WAS WALKING OUT THE DOOR, MAKE

1426
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,352
US PROUD OF YOU."

1427
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,520
AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET TO THE

1428
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,189
FINAL THREE BY KEEPING MY WORD,

1429
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,025
AND BEING HONORABLE, AND COME

1430
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,778
THE FINAL VOTE, HAVE HER SAY,

1431
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:08,904
"YOU MADE US PROUD."

1432
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,907
>> YOU KNOW, I'VE TOLD YOU HOW I

1433
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,115
FEEL.

1434
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,700
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT WHAT

1435
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,159
YOU'RE THINKING?

1436
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,327
>> RIGHT NOW.

1437
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,080
I THINK IT'S MALCOLM IN THE

1438
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:18,330
FINALS.

1439
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,998
>> TONIGHT, WE CAN EITHER BRING

1440
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,335
MALCOLM OR DENISE TO THE FINAL

1441
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:23,877
THREE.

1442
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,045
ASSUMING MICHAEL AND I WILL VOTE

1443
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,172
TOGETHER, WHICH IS A BIG

1444
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:30,008
ASSUMPTION BECAUSE SKUPIN IS A

1445
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:37,391
WILD CARD HERE.

1446
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,101
>> HE'S GOOD AT THAT.

1447
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,228
HANDING THE TITLE OF SOLE

1448
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,564
SURVIVOR ON A PLATTER TO MALCOLM

1449
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,066
WOULD JUST BE STUPID.

1450
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,192
EVERYBODY WHO SIGNED UP TO PLAY

1451
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,861
THIS GAME CAME TO WIN.

1452
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,197
AND I DID, TOO.

1453
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,700
SO AFTER WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

1454
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,867
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO

1455
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,536
MAKE SURE MALCOLM IS NOT IN THE

1456
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,036
FINAL THREE.

1457
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:17,180
.

1458
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:17,764
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1459
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,893
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1460
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,270
R.C.

1461
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,063
JEFF.

1462
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:25,981
ARTIS.

1463
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,315
PETE.

1464
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,692
PENNER.

1465
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,109
CARTER.

1466
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,111
AND ABI, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1467
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,197
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1468
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,161
SO, 38 DAYS, ONE SPOT LEFT IN

1469
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,330
THE JURY, THREE SPOTS AT THE

1470
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,249
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1471
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,209
SKUPIN, HOW BIG A FACTOR ARE

1472
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,170
ALLIANCES AT THIS POINT IN THE

1473
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:48,378
GAME?

1474
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,254
>> I MEAN, IT'S A PART OF THE

1475
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:50,255
GAME THAT GETS YOU GOING AND

1476
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,924
GETS YOU THROUGH THE MIDGAME AND

1477
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,092
GETS YOU TO THE END GAME, AND

1478
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,552
IT'S ALWAYS A FACTOR.

1479
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,805
YOU HAVE TO WEIGH OUT

1480
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,097
EVERYTHING.

1481
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,308
>> Jeff: DENISE, DOES IT HAVE

1482
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,893
ANY IMPACT THAT YOU AND MALCOLM

1483
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,770
STARTED THIS GAME TOGETHER AND

1484
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,771
SKUPE AND I KNOW LISA STARTED

1485
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,188
THIS GAME TOGETHER?

1486
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:06,521
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1487
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,273
YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE ALLIANCES

1488
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,025
FROM THE START, AND IS THERE A

1489
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,109
LOYALTY THAT YOU HOPE WILL TAKE

1490
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,569
YOU INTO THAT FINAL THREE?

1491
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,987
DO YOU LOOK AT NEW ALLIANCES

1492
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,947
THAT WERE FORMED WITH THE FOUR

1493
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:16,323
THAT GOT US HERE?

1494
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,450
AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT EACH LAYER

1495
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,075
OF THAT.

1496
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,827
YOU KNOW, THE STRATEGY, THE

1497
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,912
LOYALTY, THE ALLIANCES.

1498
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,914
I MEAN, IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO BE

1499
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,208
BUT IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T GET

1500
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:26,500
ANY EASIER.

1501
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,543
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, GIVEN HOW

1502
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,296
YOU STARTED-- YOU AND DENISE

1503
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,006
LOSING, LOSING, LOSING, AND YOU

1504
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,008
GET SPLIT UP AND SOMEHOW YOU

1505
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:35,217
SURVIVE.

1506
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:35,801
THERE'S CLEARLY SOME SORT OF

1507
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,886
LOYALTY TO DENISE BUT IT'S BEEN

1508
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:38,178
COMPLICATED.

1509
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,015
>> YEAH, THE STORY LINES GETS

1510
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:42,432
INTERTWINED.

1511
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,059
EVERYTHING GETS MIXED UP.

1512
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,977
PEOPLE YOU WERE SUPER TIGHT WITH

1513
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,813
ON DAY ONE YOU'RE NOT SO TIGHT

1514
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:48,730
WITH AT THE END.

1515
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,982
I WAS CLOSE WITH ANGY ON DAY ONE

1516
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,984
AND HAD TO CUT HER THROAT

1517
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:53,568
EARLIER THAN I HAD TO CONSIDER

1518
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,529
GETTING RID OF DENISE.

1519
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,280
>> Jeff: DENISE, THAT HAS TO

1520
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,240
GIVE YOU A BIT OF CONCERN.

1521
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,700
>> ABSOLUTELY, INCREDIBLY

1522
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,618
CONCERNING.

1523
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,911
BUT WE'RE LIKE SEPARATED AT

1524
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,621
BIRTH, AND WENT ON AND LIVED

1525
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,289
DIFFERENT LIVES AND BUILT

1526
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,249
DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS AND LUCK

1527
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,458
OF THE DRAW GOT BACK TOGETHER

1528
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,043
AND YOU HOPE THAT THAT LOYALTY

1529
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,045
IS THERE, BUT THIS IS

1530
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:12,337
"SURVIVOR."

1531
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,756
AND SO ABSOLUTELY I'M CONCERNED.

1532
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,382
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, YOU COULD

1533
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,969
READ DENISES COMMENT TWO WAYS.

1534
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,303
>> ANY GUILT I FELT FOR WHAT I

1535
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,347
JUST SAID IS GONE NOW.

1536
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,182
BUT WE'RE IN AGREEMENT.

1537
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,308
WE BOTH HAD TO FORM NEW

1538
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,103
RELATIONSHIPS TO SURVIVE IN THIS

1539
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:28,353
GRAHAM.

1540
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,771
WHEN WE GOT BACK TOGETHER WE

1541
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,565
WORKED TOGETHER AND WORKED

1542
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,275
TOGETHER VERY WELL.

1543
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,901
IT WAS ALWAYS TO A FINAL FOUR

1544
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,695
END AND WE BOTH NEW EXWOOU THAT.

1545
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:36,903
>> YUP.

1546
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,363
>> Jeff: IT'S INTERESTING THAT

1547
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,406
THERE IS DIVISION HERE, AND YET

1548
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,616
OVER HERE WITH LISA AND SKUPIN

1549
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,034
IT'S ALWAYS SEEMED SORT OF

1550
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:43,326
HARMONIOUS.

1551
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,202
>> ACTUALLY, OUR RELATIONSHIP

1552
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,872
HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AS AN "OPEN

1553
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:47,664
RELATIONSHIP," BECAUSE WE HAVE

1554
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,166
NOT BEEN TOGETHER ALL ALONG THE

1555
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:50,375
PATH.

1556
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,459
WE VOTED SEPARATE WAYS.

1557
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,378
WE WANTED TO BE TOGETHER, BUT I

1558
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,005
DIDN'T WANT TO VOTE OUT MY

1559
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,506
ALLIANCE, AND SO HE WENT WITH

1560
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,342
HIS NEW ONE, AND THEN WE KIND OF

1561
00:52:59,426 --> 00:52:59,759
RECONNECTED.

1562
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,761
SO IT HAS NOT BEEN A TRUE-BLUE

1563
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,013
ALLIANCE ALL THE WAY ALONG.

1564
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,431
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, THAT'S A

1565
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,683
LITTLE LIKE UNREQUITED LOVE.

1566
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,976
"WE WANTED TO BE TOGETHER BUT

1567
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,395
THE FORCES KEPT US APART."

1568
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,521
AND SUDDENLY THAT'S TWO VOTES

1569
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,106
OVER THERE.

1570
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,567
>> THAT WAS A SWEET STORY.

1571
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,401
>> YEAH, I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT

1572
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,486
GOES ON WITH THOSE TWO.

1573
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,279
THAT'S HOW THEY'VE BEEN FOR A

1574
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,447
REALLY LONG TIME OUT HERE.

1575
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,490
SO THIS LATE IN THE GAME,

1576
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,783
READING INTO THAT RELATIONSHIP

1577
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,869
IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.

1578
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,538
>> Jeff: SKUPIN, LET'S TALK

1579
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,082
ABOUT FAVORS, LIKE MALCOLM GAVE

1580
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,083
YOU THIS GREAT GIFT.

1581
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,293
HE LET YOUR SON HAVE THE

1582
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,128
"SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE.

1583
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,463
HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT WILL THAT

1584
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:36,796
HAVE TONIGHT?

1585
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,049
>> YOU KNOW, I TOLD MALCOLM HE'S

1586
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,676
GOT FAVORS FOR LIFE.

1587
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,345
>> Jeff: LISA, HOW ABOUT YOU.

1588
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,971
DO YOU THINK FAVORS WILL PLAY A

1589
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,139
PART IN TONIGHT'S VOTE?

1590
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,057
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

1591
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,600
BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE A

1592
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:49,726
MILLION-DOLLAR FAVOR.

1593
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,853
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY FAVORS

1594
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:52,479
HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED IN THIS GAME

1595
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,481
THAT WOULD BE WORTH A MILLION

1596
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,484
DOLLARS OR GIVING UP THE TITLE

1597
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,194
OF SOLE SURVIVOR.

1598
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,570
>> Jeff: SO TONIGHT, THIS IS

1599
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,821
SIMPLY STRATEGY FOR YOU, GET OUT

1600
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,406
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO BEAT ME.

1601
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,950
>> YES.

1602
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:05,825
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, YOU HAVE TO

1603
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,285
BE A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE

1604
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,996
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT STORY.

1605
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,498
"I WAS ON THE WORST TRIBE.

1606
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,457
I WON MY WAY BACK.

1607
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,501
I'VE WON SOME CHALLENGES.

1608
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,503
I'VE DONE SOME SOLID FAVORS.

1609
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,129
SEEM TO BE LIKABLE."

1610
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,381
YOU COULD BE THE BIGGEST THEFT.

1611
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,340
>> YEAH, I THINK I DO HAVE A

1612
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,009
PRETTY COOL STORY IF I MAKE IT

1613
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:23,718
PAST TONIGHT.

1614
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,262
BUT DENISE HAS DUN D.N.A. IT ONE

1615
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:26,972
TAD BIG BETTER.

1616
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:27,514
SHE WENT TO EVERY TRIBAL

1617
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:27,722
COUNCIL.

1618
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,349
MY HANDS ARE DIRTY AND A LOT OF

1619
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,310
PEOPLE ARE SITTING OVER THERE

1620
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,269
BECAUSE I FLIPPED.

1621
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,606
SHE NEVER HAD TO FLOIP ANYBODY.

1622
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,857
SHE FLOATED IN THE MIDDLE AND

1623
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,443
SHE'S THE ONLY KALABAW HERE SO

1624
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,361
DENISE IS FAR AND AWAY MORE

1625
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,863
DANGEROUS IN THE FINAL THREE.

1626
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,824
>> Jeff: SKUPIN MALCOLM'S

1627
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:46,992
STORY IS VERY CLEAR.

1628
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:47,492
I REALIZE I'M A THREAT.

1629
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,035
SHE DWARFS ME.

1630
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,663
>> IT'S A STRONG CASE.

1631
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,582
MALCOLM AND I, DENISE AND I,

1632
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,002
LISA AND I HAVE RUN SCENARIOS

1633
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,461
WHAT THE OTHER PERSON WOULD SAY

1634
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,754
WHEN IT CAME TO THE FINAL THREE.

1635
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,216
EVERYBODY HAS A GREAT STORY.

1636
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:04,092
>> Jeff: LISA, IS THERE A

1637
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,468
REASON YOU SHOULD TAKE MALCOLM

1638
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,594
TO THE END?

1639
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,806
>> DON'T HESITATE THAT LONG.

1640
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,350
( LAUGHTER ).

1641
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,810
>> THERE'S NOT A REASON FOR ME

1642
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:18,064
TO TAKE HIM TO THE END.

1643
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,774
>> Jeff: WOW.

1644
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,567
MALCOLM, HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

1645
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,362
>> UH-- IT'S, UH, UPSETTING TO

1646
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,573
HEAR LISA'S ANSWER.

1647
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,783
I'VE LOOKED PEOPLE IN THE EYES

1648
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,035
AND SHOOK HANDS AND WE HAVE

1649
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,453
DEALS THAT GO BEYOND THIS GAME

1650
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:36,791
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING TAKES

1651
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,250
PRECEDENCE TONIGHT.

1652
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,668
>> Jeff: WELL, THE ONLY PERSON

1653
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,421
WHO FEELS SAFE RIGHT NOW IS

1654
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,130
SKUPIN.

1655
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,090
LISA, DENISE, MALCOLM, ONE OF

1656
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,176
YOU IS ABOUT TO BECOME THE

1657
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,219
EIGHTH MEMBER OF THE JURY.

1658
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,180
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1659
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:55,393
DENISE, YOU'RE UP.

1660
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:58,021
>> HEY, MALCOLM, I COMPLETELY

1661
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,147
RESPECT THE WAY YOU PLAY THE

1662
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,523
GAME, BUT I TRIED TO APPROACH

1663
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,233
YOU, AND YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME A

1664
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:17,248
COMMITMENT SO I OUTWIT YOU.

1665
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:22,378
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S YOU

1666
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:27,884

HAVE TO SWAY TOMORROW NIGHT.

1696
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,893
THAT'S THE INVOICE FOR DOING

1697
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:00,643
WHAT THEY COULDN'T DO.

1698
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,061
YOU MADE IT TO THE END.

1699
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:02,478
THEY DIDN'T.

00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,022
YOU HAVE A SHOT AT A MILLION

1701
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:04,230
DOLLARS.

1702
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:04,564
THEY DON'T.

TRY TO ENJOY IT.

GOOD NIGHT.

1712
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,582
>> MAYBE I PUSHED TOO HARD, I

1713
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,042
LEVERAGED TOO MUCH.

1714
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,919
I HAD THEM SO DRIVEN TO FINALLY

1715
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,503
PLAY THE GAME AND SEE THREATS

1716
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,631
THAT THEY FINALLY SAW ME AS A

1717
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:29,881
THREAT.

1718
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,090
I'M PISSED OFF THAT I'M NOT

1719
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:31,674
GOING TO BE AT THE END.

1720
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:35,845
RIGHT NOW, IT'S PAINFUL FOR A

1721
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,931
LIFELONG FAN.

1722
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:59,118
>> OH, THAT WAS BRUTAL!

1723
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:03,665
>> THAT WAS MY MOST HEART

1724
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,207
WREMPING ONE YET.

1725
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,209
>> OH, SHE WAS MAD.

1726
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:06,501
HE WAS MAD.

1727
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,211
>> YEAH, REALLY MAD.

1728
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,672
>> I FEEL BADLY THAT MALCOLM WAS

1729
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,215
REALLY UPSET, BUT AT THE SAME

1730
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,007

1731
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,842
GAME I CAN SAY, MALCOLM, YOU

1732
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:15,843

1733
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,220
YOU PLAYED A GREAT GAME, BUT

1734
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,806
THIS IS THE PART WHERE I OUTWIT

1735
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:20,223
YOU.

1736
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,724
HE REALLY SOUND LIKE HE

1737
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:22,892
BELIEVED, LIKE, ABSOLUTELY, HE

1738
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,852
WAS GOING TO THAT FINAL THREE.

1739
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,147
THITHIS IS THE PART WHERE I WENT

1740
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,775
ONE STEP PAST YOU AND YOU CAN BE

1741
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,068
ANGRY BUT THAT'S THE GAME.

1742
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,404
AS HARD AS THAT WAS, IT STILL

1743
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:34,696
FEELS RIGHT.

1744
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,657
>> YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A

1745
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,741
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE, THOUGH.

1746
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,659

DOLLARS, DENISE.

1750
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:45,164
MEANING SHE WAS GOING TO RUN

1751
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,166
AWAY WITH IT.

1752
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,378
I'LL HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT

1753
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,129
THAT TOMORROW.

1754
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,880
IT'S WEIRD THAT YOU BLINDSIDE

>> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THO?

1759
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,804
I'M NOT BANKING ON IT.

1760
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,556
>> SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT WANT TO

1761
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,849
VOTE FOR ANY ONE OF US.

1762
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:07,687
I GUESS WHO CAN PLEAD THEIR CASE

1763
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,314

1770
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,960

01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,090
>> TAKE IT ALL IN.

1775
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,217
>> I'M GLAD I DIDN'T MISS THIS.

1776
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,344

TO SIT UP HERE AND HAVE A

1780
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:44,640
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

1781
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,851
>> WHO KNEW THAT IN 39 DAYS SUCH

1782
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,853
SIGNIFICANT LIFE CHANGE COULD

1783
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:49,062
HAPPEN.

1784
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:53,149
SUCH DEEP CONNECTIONS COULD BE

1785
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:53,358
BUILT.

1786
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,487
>> HERE I AM THIS LITTLE OLD SEX

ACTUALLY HAS PLAYED SOME

1789
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,075
STRATEGY.

1790
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,868
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M THRIVING OUT

1791
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:04,077

NEVER, EVER FORGET FOR THE REST

1795
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:14,003
OF YOUR LIFE.

1796
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:22,220
>> LET'S GO CHECK TREE MAIL.

>> BUTTER!

1802
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,852
>> THIS ISN'T TREE MAIL.

1803
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:30,269
THIS IS TREE MEAL.

1804
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,646
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1805
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,772
>> WE WALKED UP TO TREE MAIL

1806
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,773
THIS MORNING AND THERE WAS BACON

1807
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,900
AND SAUSAGE AND I'LL TELL YOU,

1808
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:36,818
YOUR STRENGTH STARTS TO RETURN

JUST FROM KNOWING YOU'RE GOG

1810
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:40,613
EAT.

1811
01:01:40,696 --> 01:01:42,407
I NEVER HAD SAUSAGE LIKE THIS.

1812
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:42,907
OH, I CAN'T GET ENOUGH.

1813
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,741
>> OH!

1814
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,785
>> WOW!

1815
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,995
>> 23 SEASONS I WATCHED THIS

1816
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:48,913
GAME GO.

1817
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,416
AND I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED IF I

1818
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:54,043
COULD PLAY THIS WHOLE GAME

1819
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,586
STRATEGICALLY ENOUGH TO GET

1820
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:59,173
MYSELF IN THE FINAL THREE.

1821
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,133
TO AMAZINGNESS.

1822
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:00,341
>> YES.

1823
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,134
FINAL THREE.

1824
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,051
>> FINAL THREE.

1825
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:05,680
>> I KNEW I COULD MAKE IT TO THE

1826
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,181
END 23 SEASONS AGO.

1827
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,725
WHEN I CAME OUT HERE, I TRIED TO

1828
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,853
TELL MYSELF THE SAME THING.

1829
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:14,981
BUT THOUGHT OF DOUBT KEPT

1830
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,399
CREEPING IN BECAUSE I EVERY TIME

1831
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:19,318
I GOT AROUND A CAMPFIRE I

1832
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:19,819
THOUGHT, DON'T FALL IN THE

1833
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:20,069
SUCKER.

1834
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,990
BUT I'M HERE, AND IT FEELS GOOD

1835
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,283
TO BE HERE.

1836
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,951
>> WOW, THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT

1837
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,286
FINAL THREE, THOUGH.

1838
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,537
I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS

1839
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,913
FINAL THREE.

1840
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,832
JUST THE-- THE CAMARADERIE

1841
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:33,708
BETWEEN THE THREE OF US.

1842
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,877
>> I LIKE TO THINK THERE'S NO

1843
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,127
RUNAWAY.

1844
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,880
>> NO, THERE'S NO RUNAWAY.

1845
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:43,217
IT TRULY COULD GO ANY DIRECTION.

1846
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,595
YOU KNOW, I LEFT SHOW BUSINESS,

1847
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,220
GOT MARRIED, RAISED MY KIDS, AND

1848
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,972
THAT WAS A THING OF MY PAST.

1849
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:51,058
AND NOW I'M BACK IN THE GAME OF

1850
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:51,350
"SURVIVOR."

1851
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,643
AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT IT

1852
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,104
WOULD FEEL VERY SIMILAR, BUT

1853
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,732
IT'S NOTHING LIKE WHAT I

1854
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:58,941
EXPERIENCED GROWING UP AS A

1855
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,651
CHILD BECAUSE ON THE "FACTS OF

1856
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:01,068
LIFE" I HAD A ROLE.

1857
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,529
I HAD A SCRIPT.

1858
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,656
I PLAYED A CHARACTER.

1859
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,450
I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

1860
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,701
>> ALL RIGHT.

1861
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:08,951
>> AH!

1862
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,746
>> I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE HOW

1863
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:12,371
MUCH OF YOUR EXPHAERT YOUR SOUL

1864
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,666
AND YOUR SPIRIT AND YOUR BODY

1865
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,292
ARE INVOLVED IN THIS GAME, THAT

1866
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,586
YOUR HEAD IS JUST A LITTLE BITTY

1867
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,879
PART OF IT.

1868
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,507
AND YET IT'S A HUGE PART OF IT

1869
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:26,844
WHEN IT COMES TO WINNING THE

1870
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:27,637
GAME.

1871
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,305
THE OVERWHELMING FEELING IS ONE

1872
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:29,931
OF GRATITUDE.

1873
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:32,808
I MEAN, OF THE 18 THAT STARTED,

1874
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,144
THERE ARE ONLY THREE THAT GET TO

1875
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:35,561
EXPERIENCE DAY 39.

1876
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,023
THIS IS JUST A RARE PRIVILEGE,

1877
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:43,819
AND I'M VERY AWARE AND HUMBLED

1878
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:44,987
THAT I GET TO EXPERIENCE

1879
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:48,324
SOMETHING SO INCREDIBLE.

1880
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,158
>> WOW.

1881
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,536
WE DID IT, GUYS.

1882
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:28,906
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1883
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,701
R.C.

1884
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:32,702
JEFF.

1885
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:33,828
ARTIS.

1886
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:34,870
PETE.

1887
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:35,913
PENNER.

1888
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,791
CARTER.

1889
01:04:38,874 --> 01:04:38,958
ABI.

1890
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,126
AND MALCOLM, VOTED OUT AT THE

1891
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:45,256
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1892
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,594
WELCOME TO YOUR FINAL TRIBAL

1893
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:50,136
COUNCIL.

1894
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,095
YOU HAVE DONE WHAT 15 OTHER

1895
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:54,348
PEOPLE IN THIS GAME COULDN'T

1896
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,225
DO-- YOU MADE IT TO THE END.

1897
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,227
TONIGHT, THE POWER IN THIS GAME

1898
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,521
SHIFTS TO THE JURY.

1899
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,647
EIGHT PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD A HAND

1900
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,191
IN VOTING OUT NOW HOLD YOUR FATE

1901
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,151
IN THEIR HANDS.

1902
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,778
THEY WILL DECIDE WHO'S MOST

1903
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,113
WORTHY OF THE TITLE OF SOLE

1904
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,324
SURVIVOR AND THE MILLION-DOLLAR

1905
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,158
CHECK THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.

1906
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,159
YOUR JOB TONIGHT, CONVINCE THEM

1907
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,870
IT IS YOU THAT DESERVES IT.

1908
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,204
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.

1909
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:17,955
YOU WILL EACH GET TO MAKE AN

1910
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,373
OPENING STATEMENT.

1911
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,833
THEN THE JURY GETS THEIR CHANCE

1912
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:21,834
TO ADDRESS YOU.

1913
01:05:21,917 --> 01:05:24,086
THEN WE VOTE.

1914
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,963
OPENING STATEMENTS.

1915
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:26,172
DENISE.

1916
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,882
>> LET ME START BY TELLING ALL

1917
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,550
OF YOU THE ONE THING I'M NOT

1918
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,594
GOING TO DO TONIGHT IS MAKE ANY

1919
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,928
APOLOGY FOR BEING A PART OF THIS

1920
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:33,220
FINAL THREE.

1921
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,515
I'M NOT ONLY PROUD TO BE HERE

1922
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,100
BUT I TRULY FEEL LIKE I DESERVE

1923
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:38,392
TO BE HERE.

1924
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:41,687
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADAPT AND

1925
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,188
ASSIMILATE NOT JUST IN ONE

1926
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:46,067
TRIBE, TWO TRIBES, BUT THREE

1927
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:46,317
TRIBES.

1928
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:46,984
MY ABILITY TO DO THAT GAVE ME

1929
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:50,988
TIME NOT ONLY TO BUILD INITIAL

1930
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:53,491
ALLIANCES BUT SUB ALLIANCES.

1931
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,368
IT GAVE ME TIME TO PROVE TO

1932
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,452
DIFFERENT TRIBES I HAD VALUE AND

1933
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,620
A RELATIONSHIP TO KEEP ME AROUND

1934
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:01,457
AS A WORKHORSE AT CAMP AND A

1935
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,501
VALUE AS STRATEGIST POSITIVE I

1936
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:04,210
WASN'T AFRAID TO MAKE MOVES IN

1937
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,170
THE END THAT MAY HAVE UPSET

1938
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:07,129
PEOPLE AND CHANGED THE GAME.

1939
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,173
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M THE

1940
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,425
ONE SITTING UP HERE THAT HAS

1941
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,135
SURVIVED EVERY THINK TRIBAL

1942
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:13,552
COUNCIL.

1943
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,136
AND I'M STILL SITTING HERE.

1944
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,139
I HAVE OUTWIT MANY OF YOU.

1945
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,100
I HAVE OUTPLAYED MANY OF YOU.

1946
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,519
AND ULTIMATELY, I DID OUTLAST

1947
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:22,687
ALL OF YOU.

1948
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,146
AND I BELIEVE THAT I DESERVE THE

1949
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,149
TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR.

1950
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,526
>> Jeff: LISA.

1951
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:30,986
>> I FEEL LIKE WE ALL OUTWITTED,

1952
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:31,487
OUTPLAYED, AND OUTLAST.

1953
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,197
WE JUST DID IT IN DIFFERENT

1954
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,281
WAYS.

1955
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,992
AND IT'S YOURS TO JUDGE WHICH

1956
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,619
STRATEGY DESERVES THE TITLE OF

1957
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,079
SOLE SURVIVOR AND THE MILLION

1958
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:40,287
DOLLARS.

1959
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:44,083
MY STRATEGY WAS CERTAINLY NOT

1960
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:44,291
PRETTY.

1961
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,043
I MEAN, IT WAS BASICALLY RUN

1962
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,503
WIDE OPEN AND THEN JUST FALL

1963
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,088
DOWN AND THEN GET UP AND DUST

1964
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,132
MYSELF OFF, ADJUST, LEARN

1965
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,174
SOMETHING, AND RUN SOME MORE.

1966
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:56,595
BUT I DID PLAY MY OWN GAME.

1967
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,722
UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF THE BIG

1968
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,140
MISTAKES I FEEL HIKE I MADE WAS

1969
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,183
NOT FOLLOWING MY HEART, BUT IT

1970
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,227
WASN'T UNTIL MY BROTHER CAME AND

1971
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,229
HE SAID, "YOU NEED TO TRUST YOUR

1972
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:08,357
GUT AND REMEMBER THIS IS A

1973
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:08,649
GAME."

1974
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,276
AND IT JUST HIT ME.

1975
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,486
I HADN'T TRUST MY GUT.

1976
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,155
AND I HAD FORGOTTEN IT WAS A

1977
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:14,321
GIM.

1978
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,239
AND FROM THAT POINT ON, I

1979
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:15,489
SWITCHED.

1980
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,241
I NEEDED TO PLAY THIS GAME

1981
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:18,993
WORTHY OF THE GAME.

1982
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:20,327
IT WOULD BE LIKE BEING IN A

1983
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:21,829
BOXING RING AND BEING AFRAID TO

1984
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,581
THROW A PUNCH BECAUSE I MIGHT

1985
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:24,290
HURT SOMEBODY.

1986
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,334
AND SO, AT THE END, I FINALLY

1987
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,210
GOT IT.

1988
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:28,836
I LEARNED.

1989
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,588
I GREW.

1990
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,715
AND THREW A PUNCH THAT KNOCKED

1991
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,550
OUT THE HEAVIED WEIGHT CHAMPION

1992
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,427
OF THIS SEASON, AND SAT ME HERE.

1993
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,180
SO I KNOW IT WASN'T A PRETTY

1994
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:39,388
GAME.

1995
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:42,224
BUT I LEARNED, I GREW, AND I'M

1996
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,226
PROUD OF THE FINAL GAME THAT I

1997
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,312
PLAYED AT THE END.

1998
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,773
>> Jeff: SKUPIN.

1999
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:53,778
>> RETURNING PLAYER-- AFTER

2000
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,029
WATCHING THE RETURNING SURVIVORS

2001
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:56,280
AND SOME OF THE SUCCESSES, I

2002
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,949
STARTED TO THINK I'VE GOT THE

2003
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,743
CALL TOO LATE BECAUSE RETURNING

2004
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:01,619
PLAYERS HAVE FOUND SUCCESS IN

2005
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:05,039
THIS GAME, AND EVERYBODY WANTED

2006
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,625
RETURNING PLAYERS TO NOT

2007
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:08,918
PROGRESS FARTHER THAN THEY DID.

2008
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:12,838
SO I DID THINGS WITH SUCH #-R

2009
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,883
FIRE BECAUSE I KNEW THAT MY BACK

2010
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,802
WAS UP AGAINST A WALL MORE SO

2011
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,678
THAN ANYBODY OUT HERE.

2012
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,430
I THINK I PLAYED MY GUTS OUT.

2013
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:25,142
I MEAN, I GOT PIECES OF MASK

2014
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,101
STICKING IN MY FACE.

2015
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,812
I HAD TO RESPECT THE CORE OF

2016
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,480
THIS GAME.

2017
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:30,231
OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.

2018
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,274
I CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME ANY OTHER

2019
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:32,441
WAY.

2020
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,652
I LOVE THIS GAME TOO MUCH.

2021
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:37,655
AND I KNOW YOU GUYS DO, TOO.

2022
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,324
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY, NOW

2023
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:41,450
YOUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO

2024
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,954
ADDRESS LISA, SKUPIN, AND

2025
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:45,204
DENISE.

2026
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,330
I'LL GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO GATHER

2027
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:46,664
YOUR THOUGHTS.

2028
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:48,415
AND WE'LL GET ON WITH IT.

2029
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,557
LONG TIME FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

2030
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,143
ADDRESS LISA, SKUPIN, AND

2031
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:07,393
DENISE.

2032
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,644
YOUR JOB TONIGHT IS TO GATHER

2033
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:10,479
THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO MAKE

2034
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,565
A VERY BIG DECISION, WHICH ONE

2035
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,316
OF THESE THREE IS MOST DESERVING

2036
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,986
OF THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR

2037
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:18,863
AND THE MILLION DOLLARS THAT

2038
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:19,989
GOES ALONG WITH THE WIN?

2039
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,407
LET'S GET STARTED.

2040
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:25,953
ARTIS, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

2041
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,830
>> NORMALLY, THIS IS THE PART OF

2042
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:30,624
THE GAME WHERE YOU WOULD BE

2043
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,458
CONGRATULATED FOR MAKING IT

2044
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:34,044
WHERE YOU ARE.

2045
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:37,047
UNFORTUNATELY, I CANNOT DO THAT.

2046
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,550
BECAUSE IF YOU STARTED THE GAME

2047
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:41,302
WITH THIS HOLY THAN THOU

2048
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:43,721
ATTITUDE, TALKING ABOUT LOYALTY

2049
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:46,265
AND YOU PLAYED A GAME TOTALLY

2050
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:50,352
CONTRADICTORY TO THAT YOU YOU

2051
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,396
ARE REAPING WHAT YOU SOW.

2052
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,565
IF YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO

2053
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:55,941
SOMETHING AND DON'T DO IT, YOU

2054
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,819
SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.

2055
01:09:58,903 --> 01:09:58,986
ME?

2056
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,946
I MADE ALLIANCES BUT I HELD TRUE

2057
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,990
TO ALL OF MY ALLIANCES.

2058
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:04,158
AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS GAME IS,

2059
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,743
WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE,

2060
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:10,664
KARMA IS A BITCH.

2061
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:16,170
>> Jeff: CARTER.

2062
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:17,838
>> WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

2063
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:18,714
>> .

2064
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:19,715
>> HEY, CARTER.

2065
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:22,092
>> LISA, PEOPLE KIND OF LOOKED

2066
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,427
TO YOU AS AN EASY TARGET RIGHT

2067
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:24,261
AWAY, AND YET YOU'RE SITTING

2068
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,679
HERE.

2069
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,641
AND I SAY GOOD JOB FOR THAT.

2070
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,477
I TRULY MEAN IT.

2071
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,394
SKUPIN, SAME BOAT.

2072
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:35,314
HIT THE BEACH, AND YOUR NAME WAS

2073
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,607
TOSSED AROUND MORE THAN

2074
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:36,857
ANYONE'S.

2075
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,025
AND YOU DIDN'T GO HOME.

2076
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,069
YOU'RE HERE.

2077
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,279
I KNOW THERE'S BITTERNESS, AND I

2078
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:46,033
KNOW IT SUCKS BEING UP HERE, THE

2079
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:47,826
PAIN PEOPLE FEEL AND POURING

2080
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,620
THAT ON YOU, BUT I DO FEEL LIKE

2081
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:51,580
YOU GUYS PLAYED A GOOD GAME.

2082
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,581
SKUPIN, WE WERE REALLY CLOSE,

2083
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,958
AND I KIND OF WANT TO KNOW WHAT

2084
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,293
YOUR THOUGHT WAS ON WHEN YOU

2085
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:57,419
FOUND OUT I WAS GOING HOME.

2086
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,671
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU

2087
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,882
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

2088
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:06,011
>> HART T CARTER, I HAVE TO SAY

2089
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,972
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU COULD HAVE

2090
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,431
PLAYED THE GAME HARDER.

2091
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,017
YOU WERE SO LIKABLE AND SO

2092
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:12,268
SELFLESS.

2093
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:12,893
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT YOU, THERE

2094
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:16,230
WASN'T ANY REASON TO KEEP YOU IF

2095
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:19,483
ANY OF US WANTED TO HAVE A SHOT.

2096
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:21,694
FRIENDSHIPS AND GAME AT SOME

2097
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:22,444
POINT HAVE TO BE SEPARATED.

2098
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,405
AND THE HARD ESTVOTES OUT HERE

2099
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:28,033
ARE A VOTE LIKE WE HAD TO GET

2100
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,743
RID OF YOU ONE DAY.

2101
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:30,411
>> THANKS, MAN.

2102
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:34,832
I APPRECIATE THAT.

2103
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:35,082
SERIOUSLY.

2104
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:40,671
>> Jeff: PETE, YOU'RE UP.

2105
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,089
>> HI, GUYS.

2106
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,258
LISA, I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN

2107
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,634
HIDING BEHIND THE FACT SAYING,

2108
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:46,468
"I NEVER VOTED FORARTIS.

2109
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,887
I NEVER VOTED FOR PETE."

2110
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,514
BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A JUDAS

2111
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:51,807
SITUATION WHERE YOU KIND OF

2112
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,600
DIDN'T VOTE FOR US, BUT YOU KIND

2113
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:54,518
OF KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING HOME.

2114
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:56,520
>> I DID NOT KNOW THATARTIS WAS

2115
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:58,689
GOING HOME.

2116
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:00,941
SO THAT NIGHT I WROTE DOWN

2117
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:01,275
PENNER'S NAME.

2118
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:03,360
I DID NOT KNOW ARTIS WAS THE ONE

2119
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,528
THAT WAS IN THE CROSSHAIRS AND I

2120
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:07,865
HAD MADE A DECISION TO NOT GO

2121
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:10,701
WITH THEM, KNOWING IT WOULD COST

2122
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:12,494
ME PROBABLY A MILLION DOLLARS.

2123
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,954
SO I'M GLAD I HAD A CHANCE IT

2124
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:14,455
CLEAR THAT UP.

2125
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,331
>> OKAY.

2126
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:17,708
DENISE, I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHY

2127
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,710
YOUR GAME WAS BETTER THAN

2128
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:22,421
SKUPIN'S AND LISAS AND WHY YOU

2129
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,380
DESERVE A MILLION DOLLARS.

2130
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,215
>> GOING FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE TO

2131
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:26,550
TRIBE, I THINK I WAS DEFINITELY

2132
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:28,385
FORCED TO PLAY A MUCH MORE

2133
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:29,678
STRATEGIC GAME.

2134
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,429
THAT SOCIAL PART OF THE GAME

2135
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,555
BECAME VITAL BECAUSE I HAD TO

2136
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:35,517
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SHOW THAT I

2137
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,770
HAD A REASON TO STAY IN THE

2138
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,563
TRIBE AIR, REASON TO HELP THEM

2139
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:39,855
STAY STRONG.

2140
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:41,482
GETTING TO THE MERGE, SAME

2141
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,192
THING.

2142
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:43,776
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN, ALONG WITH

2143
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,195
THE REST OF THE KALABAW TRIBE,

2144
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:46,779
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST

2145
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:47,571
ONES TO GO, NOT R.C.

2146
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:50,449
I MEAN, TRULY, HAD WE COME INTO

2147
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:53,077
THIS TRIBE OF SOLID SEVEN, YOU

2148
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,828
GUYS COULD HAVE PICKED US OFF

2149
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:55,954
ONE BY ONE.

2150
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,247
BUT THERE WERE FRACTURES, AND I

2151
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,248
WORKED WITH THAT.

2152
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,084
I WAS FORCED TO BY CHANGING

2153
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:02,377
TRIBES MULTIPLE TIMES.

2154
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:07,132
>> Jeff: THANKS, PETE.

2155
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,218
R.C.

2156
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:11,220
>> LISA.

2157
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:13,514
THE WOMAN FROM DAY ONE, SECOND

2158
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,808
ONE ON THE RAFT I WANTED OUT

2159
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,643
BECAUSE YOU WERE SO SMART AND SO

2160
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,853
SORT OF SNEAKY AND SWEET THAT I

2161
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,230
KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

2162
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,564
SO I'M NOT SURPRISED YOU'RE

2163
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,358
SITTING HERE BECAUSE I

2164
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:26,110
IDENTIFIED DAY ONE.

2165
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,987
AND YOU WERE ABLE TO OUT

2166
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,489
MANUFACTURE, OUT WIT, OUTPLAY,

2167
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:31,490
OUT THINK EVERYONE.

2168
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,574
SO I'M EVERYWHERE PROUD OF YOU

2169
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,243
AND CONGRATULATIONS.

2170
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:35,411
>> THANK YOU, R.C.

2171
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:36,829
>> MICHAEL.

2172
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,997
ON DAY 19, WAS THERE SOMETHING

2173
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,457
THAT YOU MAYBE SHOULD HAVE TOLD

2174
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:40,624
ME?

2175
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,584
>> ON DAY 19, PENNER WAS GOING

2176
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:43,961
HOME.

2177
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:44,586
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE GOING

2178
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:44,795
HOME.

2179
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:48,423
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW MY NAME WAS

2180
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:48,841
BEING WRITTEN DOWN?

2181
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,592
>> NO, I KNEW PENNER WAS GOING

2182
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,302
AND THAT'S WHAT I KNEW AND I

2183
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,720
THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLETE

2184
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,806
MINDSIDE AND THAT'S THE WAY THEY

2185
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:56,014
VOTED.

2186
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,391
I WOULD NEVER HAVE WANTED TO GET

2187
01:13:57,474 --> 01:13:58,350
RID OF YOU.

2188
01:13:58,433 --> 01:14:00,227
>> THANK YOU, GUYS.

2189
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,562
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN.

2190
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:04,231
>> Jeff: THANKS, R.C.

2191
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:04,481
MALCOLM.

2192
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:09,361
>> ALL RIGHT.

2193
01:14:09,444 --> 01:14:10,487
>> HI, GUYS.

2194
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,990
I DIDN'T HAVE QUESTIONS UNTIL

2195
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,324
THIS THING STARTED, BUT LISA

2196
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,118
CAME OUT AND GAVE HER OPENING

2197
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:16,743
SPEECH SHE WAS SWINGING FOR THE

2198
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:16,994
FENCES.

2199
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:19,663
I DIDN'T THINK SHE HAD IT IN HER

2200
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:20,664
BUT IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED

2201
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:22,040
TO HEAR FROM HER, AND FOR THE

2202
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,959
FIRST TIME I REALLY CONSIDERED

2203
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,752
WRITING YOUR NAME DOWN TONIGHT.

2204
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,713
DENISE YOU NEEDED-- DON'T NOD.

2205
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,756
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, DON'T

2206
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,507
NOD.

2207
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,633
DON'T NOD.

2208
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,218
THIS APPEASING EVERYBODY THING

2209
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:33,886
HAS TO STOP.

2210
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,679
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE DAY

2211
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:35,846
ONE.

2212
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:37,139
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING.

2213
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:38,182
YOU'RE A THERAPIST.

2214
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:39,266
BUT NOW I WANT TO HEAR HOW

2215
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:41,143
YOU'RE GOING TO WIN THIS GAME,

2216
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:42,394
HOW YOU PLAYED BETTER AND WHY

2217
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,688
YOU DESERVED IT MORE, AND I

2218
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:46,523
DON'T WANT THIS APPEASING THING,

2219
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,233
THIS TRYING TO PLAY NICE, TRYING

2220
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:48,775
TO KEEP FRIENDS THROUGH THE

2221
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:49,985
ENTIRE PROCESS.

2222
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:52,571
>> HOW DID I OUTWIT OR OUTPLAYED

2223
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:53,947
THESE TWO.

2224
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,866
YOU'RE RIGHT, BEING A THERAPIST

2225
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,534
IS WHAT I DO, AND SOME OF THAT

2226
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:58,744
IS APPEASING BECAUSE THERE IS

2227
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,037
VALUE IN THIS GAME TO PLAYING

2228
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,538
THAT SOCIAL PIECE.

2229
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,582
BUT THERE'S ALSO VALUE IN JUST

2230
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:04,583
LISTENING AND OBSERVES TO WHAT

2231
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,751
PEOPLE SAY.

2232
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,628
THAT'S A PART OF WHO I AM THAT I

2233
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:09,671
COULDN'T NOT BRING INTO THE

2234
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:09,963
GAME.

2235
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:11,840
SO IT MAY SEEM APPEASING BUT I

2236
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:12,966
WAS PLAYING THE GAME EVERY STEP

2237
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:13,675
OF THE WAY.

2238
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,135
AND I'M SITTING HERE AND YOU'RE

2239
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,721
STANDING THERE.

2240
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,681
>> YOU GOT HUNG UP ON ONE WORD.

2241
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,141
THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED AT ALL.

2242
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:22,601
THE QUESTION WAS HOW DID YOU

2243
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:23,477
BEAT THESE TWO?

2244
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,978
>> BY THE STRATEGY THEY PLAYED.

2245
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,772
BY THE STRATEGY OF BEING HERE.

2246
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:27,397
I I DON'T THINK THEY PLAYED THAT

2247
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,608
KIND OF A STRATEGIC GAME.

2248
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,944
>> THANKS.

2249
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:35,948
>> Jeff: THANKS, MALCOLM.

2250
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:40,869
JEFF.

2251
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:43,330
>> THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE ALL

2252
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:45,332
SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF

2253
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:46,416
BITTERNESS, SOME AT DIFFERENT

2254
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,793
LEVELS THAN OTHERS BECAUSE WE'RE

2255
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,253
SITTING HERE AND YOU GUYS ARE

2256
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:49,711
SITTING THERE.

2257
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,671
I'M A LITTLE BITTER, TOO, BUT I

2258
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:54,758
CAN HANDLE IT REALLY WELL.

2259
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:55,801
SKUPIN, I'VE LEARNED THROUGHOUT

2260
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,594
MY LIFE AND CAREER THAT THERE

2261
01:15:57,678 --> 01:16:00,138
ARE THREE KINDS OF PEOPLE.

2262
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,682
PEOPLE THAT MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

2263
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:04,268
PEOPLE THAT WATCH THINGS HAPPEN.

2264
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,353
AND PEOPLE THAT WONDER WHAT THE

2265
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:07,688
HELL JUST HAPPENED.

2266
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:08,021
( LAUGHTER ).

2267
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,816
WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

2268
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:11,858
GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES IN THE

2269
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,361
GAME OF WHICH ONE YOU ARE.

2270
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:16,238
>> I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY MAKE

2271
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:16,613
THINGS HAPPEN.

2272
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:17,823
I MEAN, ONE OF MY FAMILY MOTOS

2273
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,825
IS ARE YOU GOING TO WATCH THE

2274
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,660
NEWS TODAY OR MAKE THE NEWS?

2275
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:22,786
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY THINK

2276
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:29,251
WAS HUGE HERE IS MY NECK WAS

2277
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:32,129
CHOPPING BLOCK EVERY SINGLE DAY.

2278
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:37,050
WHEN I LOOK AT LISA AND DENISE'S

2279
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:39,303
GAME, I NEVER HEARD DENISE'S

2280
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:40,554
GRAHAM NAMEBROUGHT UP.

2281
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:43,056
WHEN MY NAME CAME UP, I HAD TO

2282
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,599
SHIFT OR CREATE OR TRY AND DO

2283
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:47,311
THINGS AND MY NAME CAME UP EVERY

2284
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:49,271
SINGLE TIME UNTIL PENNER LEFT.

2285
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:52,566
>> LISA, GIVE ME A REASON WHY,

2286
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:53,942
MAYBE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU

2287
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,777
DIDN'T PLAY IN THE MIDDLE, HOW

2288
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,947
YOU DID FLOAT ALONG LIKE DENISE

2289
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,115
THAT SEPARATES THE TWO OF YOU?

2290
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,700
>> I CAN'T EVEN RECALL A TIME I

2291
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:02,784
FLOATED IN THE MIDDLE.

2292
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,077
I MAYBE SHOULD HAVE FLOATED IN

2293
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:08,915
THE MIDDLE BECAUSE I WAS PRETTY

2294
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:11,209
WIDE OPEN THE WHOLE TIME.

2295
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,295
I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO MAKE A

2296
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:15,088
MAJOR MOVE WHEN I FOUND OUT

2297
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:17,174
MALCOLM HAD THE IDOL AND I WENT

2298
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:19,092
TO PETE AND SAID THIS IS TIME TO

2299
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:19,426
BLINDSIDE HIM.

2300
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:21,345
WE HAD IT ALL PLANNED AND IN THE

2301
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:21,887
LAST 15 MINUTES IT BLEW UP.

2302
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,805
PETE HAD A PLAN B.

2303
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,223
AND THAT WAS TO SEND YOU HOME,

2304
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,643
WHICH STILL WAS GOOD, BECAUSE IT

2305
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,812
WOULD KEEP OUR TANDANG NUMBERS--

2306
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,022
>> THAT'S FINE ON THAT.

2307
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:32,898
BUT I THINK THAT PROVES MY

2308
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:33,565
EXAMPLE HERE.

2309
01:17:33,648 --> 01:17:34,900
YOU TRIED TO MAKE SOMETHING

2310
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:35,108
HAPPEN.

2311
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:35,734
YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN, SO

2312
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,819
YOU JUST AGREED WITH EVERYBODY

2313
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,446
ELSE, WHICH MEANS YOU JUST

2314
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:39,738
FLOATED BY.

2315
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,948
>> NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.

2316
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:44,493
I AGREED BECAUSE IT WAS STILL,

2317
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,244
ALONG WITH MY PLAN, WHICH WAS

2318
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,746
KEEP TANDANG NUMBERS STRONG.

2319
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,623
SO YOU WERE ON KALABAW, SO THAT

2320
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:52,542
WAS A GREAT PLAN, AND I PLAYED

2321
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:53,502
IT HARD FROM HERE.

2322
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:56,004
I SAID WE'VE GOT PLAN B, GIETZ.

2323
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:56,755
GO WITH PLAN B.

2324
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:59,091
THAT'S NOT FLOATING IN THE

2325
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,592
MIDDLE STANDING UP HERE AND

2326
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:02,344
SAYING WE'VE GOT PLAN B, LET'S

2327
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,637
GO WITH PLAN B.

2328
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:04,513
THAT'S PRETTY VOCAL.

2329
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:06,431
>> ALL RIGHT.

2330
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:06,765
THANKS, JEFF.

2331
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:09,893
>> Jeff: ABI, YOU'RE UP.

2332
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:11,895
>> HELLO, GUYS.

2333
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:12,646
>> HI.

2334
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:13,438
>> HI.

2335
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,692
>> I WAS CALLED TO BE THE MOST

2336
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,693
UNLIKABLE PERSON IN THE TRIBE BY

2337
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:19,945
THE THREE OF YOU.

2338
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,864
7 MY HEART'S BROKEN.

2339
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:26,159
LISA, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

2340
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,452
DESERVING OF A MILLION DOLLARS?

2341
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:28,954
WHY DO YOU THINK I SHOULD WRITE

2342
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:30,080
DOWN YOUR NAME BECAUSE I REALLY

2343
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:31,706
DON'T KNOW WHO I'M GOING TO VOTE

2344
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:31,998
FOR TONIGHT.

2345
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:33,667
>> I BELIEVE I'M DESERVING OF

2346
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,710
YOUR VOTE BECAUSIST ABSOLUTELY

2347
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:36,837
TRUE TO THE END WITH THIS

2348
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,506
ALLIANCE, AND PLANNED TO GO ALL

2349
01:18:39,589 --> 01:18:40,799
THE WAY THE FINAL FOUR WITH THAT

2350
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,384
ALLIANCE.

2351
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:45,637
UNTIL IT DISINTEGRATED.

2352
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,764
AND IF THAT HAD WORKED, YOU AND

2353
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,975
ARTIS AND PETER AND I WOULD BE

2354
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:50,809
SITTING IN THE FINAL FOUR.

2355
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,102
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE I DESERVE

2356
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:52,352
YOUR VOTE.

2357
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:55,147
>> MICHAEL, WHY DO YOU THINK I

2358
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,316
SHOULD GIVE YOU A MILLION

2359
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,860
DOLLARS TONIGHT OR DO YOU EVEN

2360
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:01,778
CARE THEY WOULD WRITE YOUR NAME

2361
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:02,320
DOWN OR NOT?

2362
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,906
>> I BELIEVE THAT I DESERVE YOUR

2363
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:09,453
VOTE BECAUSE WHAT THIS GAME IS

2364
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:11,746
ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT OUTWIT,

2365
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:12,164
OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.

2366
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:13,707
AND I BELIEVE IF YOU LOOK AT

2367
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:14,916
THOSE THREE PRINCIPLES, THERE'S

2368
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,793
NOBODY SITTING UP HERE THAT DID

2369
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:19,254
THAT REMOTELY EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT

2370
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:20,380
I DID IN THIS GAME.

2371
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,175
>> BUT I DON'T BELIEVE ONE OF

2372
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:25,260
THE CORE VALUES OF THE GAME IS

2373
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:25,635
OUT-DISRESPECT.

2374
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:26,178
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS,

2375
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:26,386
EITHER.

2376
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,181
>> THANK YOU.

2377
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:29,931
DENISE, YOU MADE VERY CLEAR THAT

2378
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:33,268
YOU DIDN'T DNOT RESPECT MY GAME,

2379
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:36,021
THAT I WAS AN UNLIKABLE PERSON,

2380
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,023
BEING THE MOST UNLIKABLE PERSON

2381
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:40,233
IS NOT THE LABEL THAT I WANTED

2382
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,027
TO LEAVE HERE WITH.

2383
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,445
I WAS DEMORALIZED.

2384
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:45,864
I WAS MADE TO LOOK THIS LITTLE.

2385
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:49,451
>> HINDSIGHT IS 20-20.

2386
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:50,869
AND AS MUCH AS THERE MAY BE MANY

2387
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,996
SENTIMENTS IN WHAT I SAID, THAT

2388
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:54,414
I STILL STAND BEHIND, THERE MAY

2389
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,832
HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT WAY FOR ME

2390
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:56,791
TO HANDLE IT.

2391
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,418
AND I DO APOLOGIZE.

2392
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,545
IF YOU WERE TRULY TRAUMATIZE BY

2393
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,298
THAT, IF YOU WERE TRULY

2394
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:04,007
DEMORALIZED BY THAT, I DO

2395
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:04,257
APOLOGIZE.

2396
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,885
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT MY ATTENTION.

2397
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:10,764
BUT WHEN WE PRESENT OUR

2398
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:11,389
STRATEGIES, JUST DIDN'T MESH.

2399
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,558
>> THANK YOU.

2400
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:17,896
>> Jeff: THANKS, ABI.

2401
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:18,104
PENNER.

2402
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:20,273
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S END THIS

2403
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:20,774
THING.

2404
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:21,983
GUYS, HI.

2405
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:22,359
CONGRATULATIONS.

2406
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:24,402
OBVIOUSLY, WE ALL WISH WE WERE

2407
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:25,737
SITTING THERE.

2408
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:28,657
AS JEFF SAYS, THERE IS SOME

2409
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,575
VESTIGE OF FURY?

2410
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:31,535
OF COURSE THERE IS.

2411
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:33,787
HOW CAN THERE HELP BUT BE.

2412
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,580
WE'VE ALL GIVEN OUR HEARTS AND

2413
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,249
SOULS TO THIS GAME, SOME OF US A

2414
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,668
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEART AND

2415
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:39,876
SOUL.

2416
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,045
AND TO SEE ANYONE BUT OURSELVES

2417
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:43,880
SITTING THERE LOOKING AT ANYONE

2418
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:45,840
ELSE IS PAINFUL.

2419
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:49,427
THAT SAID, YOU HAVE MY HEART

2420
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:50,053
FELT CONGRATULATIONS.

2421
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:51,471
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON TONIGHT

2422
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:52,514
IS HARD.

2423
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:53,056
SMART PEOPLE ASKING TOUGH

2424
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:53,306
QUESTIONS.

2425
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,600
I WILL HOPE TO CONTINUE THAT

2426
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:56,726
TRADITION.

2427
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:59,479
( LAUGHTER )

2428
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,856
DENISE, WE'VE HAD A LOT OF TIME

2429
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:02,107
TOGETHER.

2430
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,817
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY SOME OF

2431
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,694
WHAT YOU SAID TONIGHT, APPEASING

2432
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:06,987
IS WHAT HAPPENED.

2433
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,572
YOU SHARED WITH ME ONCE THAT THE

2434
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:09,948
ONE THING THAT YOU WERE SORT OF

2435
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:13,868
AFRAID OF BEING SEEN AS WAS A

2436
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:14,077
BITCH.

2437
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:18,081
YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT YOU

2438
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:20,125
HAVE NOW SHOWN THE WORLD THAT

2439
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,335
SIDE.

2440
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:23,420
SKUPIN, YOU'RE SITTING HERE

2441
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:24,921
TELLING US HOW YOUR NAME KEPT

2442
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:26,548
COMING UP AND HOW YOU WERE

2443
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:27,549
THREATENED ALL THE TIME.

2444
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:28,466
I DON'T THINK YOUR NAME-- AND

2445
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,343
YOU GUYS WILL CORRECT ME IF I'M

2446
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:31,136
WRONG EYE DON'T THINK YOUR NAME

2447
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,388
HAS BEEN WRITTEN DOWN ONE TIME

2448
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:34,639
IN THIS ENTIRE GAME.

2449
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,766
I HAVE THE PROUD DISTINCTION OF

2450
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,435
HAVING MY NAME WRITTEN DOWN I

2451
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:39,477
BELIEVE 15 TIMES.

2452
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:39,978
( LAUGHTER ).

2453
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:43,732
WHICH MAY BE A RECORD-- NO, I

2454
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:44,941
THINK PHILLIP SHEPARD HAS MORE

2455
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:48,153
TIMES, BUT I MAY HAVE CLOSE TO A

2456
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:49,863
RECORD, 15 TIMES MY NAME IS

2457
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:50,196
WRITTEN DOWN.

2458
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,114
SO I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SITTING

2459
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,116
HERE SAYING THAT THERE WAS THIS

2460
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,784
BIG TARGET ON YOUR BACK, BUT

2461
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:58,997
HOWEVER YOU SCRAMBLED OR DISSEM

2462
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,457
BELD, BACKSTABBED AND

2463
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,625
FLIP-FLOPPED, YOU WERE ABLE TO

2464
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,001
AVOID HAVING YOUR NAME WRITTEN

2465
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:04,085
DOWN EVEN ONCE.

2466
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:05,503
YOU MAY FIND THAT YOU HAVE A

2467
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,088
PERFECT RECORD, EVEN AFTER

2468
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,425
TONIGHT.

2469
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:14,638
LISA, MY FRIEND, WE GOT CLOSE

2470
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:15,597
OUT HERE.

2471
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,890
WE BOTH KNOW THAT WE DID.

2472
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:18,725
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH

2473
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:20,393
EVERYBODY OR SHALL I?

2474
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:21,019
>> EITHER ONE.

2475
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,104
I'LL BE HAPPY TO BECAUSE I-- I

2476
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:23,605
MEAN, I DON'T--

2477
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:26,066
>> NO, NO, I DON'T WANT TO SHAME

2478
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:26,524
YOU, SUMMER.

2479
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:27,692
>> IT'S NOT A SHAME.

2480
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,027
>> NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

2481
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:29,778
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

2482
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:30,153
>> YEAH.

2483
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:37,160
>> LEA WAS A TELEVISION STAR.

2484
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:38,078
SHE SPENT NINE YEARS ON THE

2485
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,871
TELEVISION PROGRAM "THE FACTS OF

2486
01:22:39,954 --> 01:22:41,039
LIFE."

2487
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:44,167
FROM THE AGE OF 12 TO THE AGE OF

2488
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,293
21, SHE WAS AMERICA'S

2489
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:45,835
SWEETHEART-- STILL MAY BE.

2490
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,504
YOU GUYS DESERVE TO KNOW THAT

2491
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:50,298
WHEN YOU VOTE OR DON'T VOTE FOR

2492
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,216
HER THAT SHE HAS KEPT THAT FROM

2493
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:54,052
ALL OF YOU, AND I KEPT YOUR

2494
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,053
SECRET SAFE UNTIL NOW.

2495
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:56,888
>> CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

2496
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:57,931
>> ANYTHING YOU WANT?

2497
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:00,225
>> DID YOU REVEAL TO ANY OF US

2498
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:01,101
WHAT YOU DID AS A TEENAGER, WHAT

2499
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:03,728
JOB YOU HAD AS A TEENAGER, LIKE

2500
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:04,729
25 YEARS AGO?

2501
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,648
OR DID YOU TALK MORE ABOUT WHO

2502
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,483
YOU ARE NOW, WHAT YOU'VE BEEN

2503
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:10,610
DOING, AND WHAT YOU BRING TO THE

2504
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:10,902
GAME NOW?

2505
01:23:10,985 --> 01:23:12,278
>> I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WHEN I

2506
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,364
WENT TO THE BATHROOM 16 DAYS--

2507
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:15,240
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I DIDN'T

2508
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:17,200
TALK ABOUT, EITHER.

2509
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:18,451
MY LIFE, WOULD YOU REALLY LIKE

2510
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,202
TO HEAR NOW?

2511
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:20,245
SHOULD WE TAKE THE TIME AND I

2512
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,246
CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT DIWHEN I WAS

2513
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:22,706
12 TO 21.

2514
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:24,165
IF YOU GUYS ARE INTERESTED, I

2515
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,583
DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO AFFECT

2516
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,544
THE OUTCOME TONIGHT.

2517
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:28,670
MAYBE LATER I'LL TELL YOU ALL

2518
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,296
ABOUT IT.

2519
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,047
I THINK THAT ONE OF YOU HAS

2520
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:35,885
RIDDEN THE OTHER TWO IN HERE.

2521
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:36,136
LIKE OXEN.

2522
01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:39,806
YOU HAVE BEEN YOKED TO A CART

2523
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:42,308
AND HAVE BEEN RIDDEN IN, AND NOW

2524
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,101
YOU WILL BE LED TO THE

2525
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:43,393
SLAUGHTER.

2526
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:45,061
AND YOU HEAR THE CHEERING.

2527
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,272
YOU THINK THE MILLION DOLLARS IS

2528
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:47,439
YOURS.

2529
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,190
ONE OF YOU IS RIGHT.

2530
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:52,152
ONE OF OF YOU IS STANDING IN THE

2531
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:52,402
CHARIOT.

2532
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:54,112
AND THE OTHER TWO ARE ACTUALLY

2533
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,656
JUST THE OXIEN LISTENING TO THE

2534
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,742
CROWD CHEERING THE OTHER PERSON.

2535
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:00,785
I'M DONE.

2536
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,329
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY.

2537
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:05,749
A VERY LIVELY FINAL TRIBAL

2538
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:06,249
COUNCIL.

2539
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:07,250
HOPEFULLY, YOU GATHERED THE

2540
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:08,168
INFORMATION YOU NEED TO NOW MAKE

2541
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,712
A VERY BIG DECISION.

2542
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:14,591
WHICH ONE OF THESE THREE-- LISA,

2543
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:16,926
SKUPIN, OR DENISE-- DO YOU THINK

2544
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,678
MOST DESERVES TO WIN THIS GAME

2545
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,180
AND THE MILLION DOLLARS THAT

2546
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:21,765
GOES ALONG WITH IT?

2547
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,099
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MOMENT

2548
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:24,142
TO GATHER YOUR THOUGHTS.

2549
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,394
WE'LL COME BACK AND WE WILL

2550
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:44,329
VOTE.

2551
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:46,080
LISA, SKUPIN, DENISE.

2552
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:46,706
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE TO ADDRESS

2553
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:47,791
THE JURY.

2554
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,459
THE JURY HAS HAD THEIR CHANCE TO

2555
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:49,751
ADDRESS YOU.

2556
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,878
WE NOW GET TO THE VOTE.

2557
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:54,005
JURY, YOU ARE VOTING FOR A

2558
01:24:54,088 --> 01:24:54,214
WINNER.

2559
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:55,423
THE PERSON'S NAME WHO YOU WRITE

2560
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,675
DOWN YOU THINK IS MOST DESERVING

2561
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:58,301
OF WINNING THIS GAME AND THE

2562
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,512
MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES WITH

2563
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:00,678
IT.

2564
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:04,307
39 DAYS OF "SURVIVOR" CAN TAKE A

2565
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:05,725
TREMENDOUS TOLL ON A PERSON.

2566
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:08,103
FOR ONE OF YOU, IT'S ABOUT TO BE

2567
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:08,645
WORTH IT.

2568
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:10,480
FOR THE LAST TIME, IT IS TIME TO

2569
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:10,814
VOTE.

2570
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:24,160
JEFF, YOU'RE UP.

2571
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:27,247
>> THE MINUTE I GOT ON THE RAFT

2572
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,999
I WANTED YOU GONE BECAUSE I KNEW

2573
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,293
WHAT A THREAT YOU WERE.

2574
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:36,339
SO YOU CERTAINLY DESERVE THIS

2575
01:25:36,422 --> 01:25:40,677
