1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,236
- (Jeff Probst)
Previously on<i> Survivor...</i>

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,905
Kim was upset that Brandon
abandoned their alliance

3
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,807
to join forces with Lex.

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:11,544
- I was set up by somebody who
I thought was my friend.

5
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:15,081
- (Probst) And Lex's motives
were in question because of his

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,549
alliance with Brandon.

7
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,152
- He has no loyalty to me.
He has no loyalty to Tom.

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,689
He has no loyalty to Kim.
He only has loyalty to you.

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,525
- (Probst) The African bush was
beginning to take its toll.

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,294
- Tom's got a massive boil.
I mean, it's big.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,996
I've never seen
a boil that big.

12
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,699
- (Probst) Lex won immunity and
wanted to vote for Frank at

13
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,568
Tribal Council, but everyone
else, including Kim, joined

14
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,738
forces and voted Brandon
out of the tribe.

15
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,373
Seven are left.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,709
Tonight,
one more will go.

17
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,190
- At the last Tribal Council,
we voted off Brandon, and you

18
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,460
know, we had been pals since our
early days in Samburu.

19
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,697
But you know, I felt
very betrayed by him from the

20
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,765
previous Tribal Council and I
didn't trust him any longer,

21
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,634
so I had to vote him out.

22
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,070
I guess it's all part of the
game, but it still tugged at my

23
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:18,104
heart a little bit.

24
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,744
- Tom, Ethan, Kim and I are all
still standing, and we've got an

25
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,013
advantage now-- we've got
everyone else outnumbered.

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,449
But they knew what I was pretty
close to Brandon--

27
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,019
he was a friend-- and that I'd
have a really hard time voting

28
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,121
for him, and I didn't
vote for him.

29
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,156
We're still solid, right?

30
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,092
We're still solid
from day one, right?

31
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,527
- 100%, absolutely.

32
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,528
- All right.

33
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,696
- All right.

34
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,366
- Lex's vote, I think,
just pushed the limits

35
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,700
of our alliance.

36
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:51,170
It kind of redefined how tight
our bonds were.

37
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,840
You know, he gave
his word to Brandon,

38
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,308
but he gave his word to
us, also.

39
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,478
Lex kind of went out an his own
and covered his own ass.

40
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,881
- He gave his word to me,
you and Tom,

41
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,950
and he gave his word to
Brandon.

42
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,221
Why was his word just as strong
with Brandon as it was with us?

43
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,424
- As much as Tommy, Lex and
Ethan think that they want to go

44
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,395
into the finals, the three
of them, I don't really

45
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,963
think that they do.

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,465
I think that they're all
skeptical of each other,

47
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,900
and they know,
when it gets down to

48
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,835
crunch time, that one of them is
going to have to be voted off.

49
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,186
(rustling)

50
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,457
- What the hell was that?

51
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,492
(lion roaring loudly)

52
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,361
- Ho...

53
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,864
(roaring, huffing)

54
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,568
- Me and little Kim were on the
2:00 to 4:00 shift and out of

55
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,838
nowhere we just heard lots of
heavy grunting moving closer and

56
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,540
closer and closer.

57
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,743
(lion grunting)

58
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,146
I think the lion is probably
stalking, but I don't know why

59
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,781
it would make a noise if...

60
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,983
(roaring)

61
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,262
- I thought they made that
noise when they were calling

62
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,530
other lions to come feed.

63
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,166
- You might be right.

64
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,669
- You know what was scary, was
the fact that you had no idea

65
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,970
what the lion wanted.

66
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,672
Are they just communicating,
or is it trying to call

67
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,041
the other lion in
because it smells us?

68
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,144
(lion growling)

69
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,146
Yeah, he wants
to come and eat...

70
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,147
(loud growling)

71
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,148
Oh, my God.

72
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,917
Oh, my God.

73
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,488
The perimeter is closed in all
the way with the acacia bush or

74
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:52,358
thorn bushes all the way around,
but it's only maybe six feet

75
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,894
tall, and I'm sure a lion would
be able to get up and over it

76
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,195
if they wanted in.

77
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:00,733
(lion roaring loudly)

78
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,375
- It's close.

79
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,216
- I'll protect you.

80
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,722
- Obviously, they live right
here, and they must watch us

81
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,191
every day when we go for water
as we come out in the morning

82
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,225
and do stuff.

83
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,360
They are really here.

84
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,596
They are really,
like, right in this area.

85
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,999
- I still feel vulnerable.

86
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,034
It's not our land at all.

87
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,671
It's their land, and we're just
living in it for 39 days.

88
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,740
(roaring)

89
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,115
- I think it went, "Kim, Kim,
Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim."

90
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,652
I think I heard it say that.

91
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,176
- Hey, Zonyo!

92
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,245
- What's up, buster?

93
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,319
- You just wear yourself out
walking over here?

94
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,321
- I'm dead.

95
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,057
- Having been out here now for
a month, it's just starting to

96
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,525
catch up with us.

97
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,028
Everybody's started to feel more
lethargic, weaker, and it all...

98
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,532
It's interesting because it all
happened at the same time.

99
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,400
And we felt comfortable
admitting it because it was

100
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,970
obvious that everyone was
feeling the same way.

101
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,105
- Whoa.

102
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,008
- It feels like you're walking
under water, so your steps are

103
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,444
slow, your legs are a little,
like, shaky.

104
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,946
You don't pick your feet up as
high off the ground because you

105
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,582
just don't want to, so you kind
of stumble on even just little

106
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,285
roots this big.

107
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,454
- Oh, mama cat.

108
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,122
- Isn't that weird?

109
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,057
- Holy mackerel.

110
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,427
- Poor Kim Johnson, her legs
are really, really swollen from

111
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,729
her knees down.

112
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,897
I mean really swollen.

113
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,199
She can hardly lace up
her sneakers.

114
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,668
- You just push it with
your finger and it stays.

115
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,004
It's like Silly Putty
or something.

116
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,005
- I know.

117
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,307
- It's actually
almost climbing up.

118
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,608
Wait till it gets
to my breasts.

119
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,643
- Whoa!

120
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,546
- Look out then!

121
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,282
- Our bodies are starting to
show signs of trouble.

122
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,750
We're start to get sick.

123
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,187
In the last couple, three days,
we've all noticed that we're

124
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,321
getting thinner.

125
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,722
It's starting
to really show.

126
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,091
- Man, you've lost
a ton of weight.

127
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,994
- Yeah, I'd say
I've lost 40 pounds.

128
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,429
- 40 pounds?

129
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,097
Wow.

130
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,366
- Let's decide: do we want the
mush or do we want the gruel

131
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,769
this morning?

132
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,638
We eat two small meals a day.
I figure we're having, I don't

133
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,041
know, maybe a couple of hundred
calories, if that.

134
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,310
And we're eating, I think, just
enough to fool our bodies into

135
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,412
thinking that we're getting
nutrition when we really aren't.

136
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,948
- It's ready.

137
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,649
- We have maize.

138
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,319
It's cornmeal, basically, is
what it is, so we eat that

139
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,555
either in like, just, mushed-up
balls we boil in water.

140
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,758
And then we snack on,
like, kernels of corn.

141
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,694
They don't really pop,
but we kind of brown them

142
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,028
and burn them.

143
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,430
- Those are
too hard for me.

144
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,631
They just--
they hurt my teeth.

145
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,799
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,635
And then we make
a corn broth soup.

147
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,837
- I'm eating it, even though
I don't really want to.

148
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,505
It's just kind of a...

149
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,841
just a watery gruel
with some, you know,

150
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,309
some corn kernels in it.

151
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,848
- It's just so hard
to get down because...

152
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,751
it's like eating chalk twice
a day, and then they

153
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:43,623
put corn in it and then
you've got chalk with some corn.

154
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,358
- (burps)

155
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,532
- Lex is worried.

156
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,802
- He's worried because he knows
I didn't like what he done.

157
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:01,207
At the last Tribal Council,
Lex cast a vote for Frank

158
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,875
instead of
Brandon.

159
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,646
We had an alliance, me him and
Ethan, and the alliance was we'd

160
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:12,318
vote together, and Lex
jeopardized that alliance when

161
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,754
he voted for Frank.

162
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,756
- Before I came
into this thing,

163
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,357
I was totally
100% anti-alliance.

164
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,227
I wanted to do it myself
and all by myself.

165
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,262
But I realized that's
impossible.

166
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,297
- You can't do it.

167
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,198
- You can't do it.

168
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,967
- I felt betrayed.

169
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,202
- I don't understand why
you don't let Lex know.

170
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,371
- Because when he made that
agreement with Brandon,

171
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,173
he didn't come to me.

172
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,608
He didn't
come to you either.

173
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,777
He did it on his own.

174
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,680
All he was worried about
was Lex.

175
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,082
Now he's got to thinking
about me and you, right?

176
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,116
- Yeah.

177
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,584
- Okay.

178
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,521
- I know Tom's true to me and
Kim, but probably take a little

179
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:51,023
bit to get Lex
back on his good side.

180
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,693
- I don't know what'll happen
in the future,

181
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,497
but from here on out, you know,
I'll have question with Lex.

182
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,765
- What's up, boys?

183
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,368
- Hey.

184
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,479
- Mail?

185
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,513
- Can you guess the hint?

186
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,284
- That is such
a cool clue!

187
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,318
- Look here.

188
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,519
- Look, look.

189
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,654
- What's the difference between
the pig and me?

190
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,688
- No boil on the pig.

191
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,056
- That's what I said!

192
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,494
- "You'll need all your strength
for events down the road.

193
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,164
Today is a great day
for a good carbo load."

194
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,833
- Pasta.

195
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,571
- "Proteins and sugars will
give you power to burn.

196
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:43,042
So if you are clever,
these gifts you may earn."

197
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,855
- (Probst) All right, guys.

198
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,824
For today's reward challenge,
we thought we'd give you a break

199
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,159
on the challenge.

200
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,861
And just make it pure reward.

201
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,462
- Yay!

202
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,531
- (Probst) You each have a
personalized wallet.

203
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,832
Go ahead and open it up.

204
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,602
You've each got 20,000 Kenyan
shillings inside.

205
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,004

shilling increments.

as you're pooling money.

214
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,624

215

00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,373
Don't look.

349
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,975
- Kim, I'll give you
seven for half.

350
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,177
- Fried chicken
and mashed potatoes.

351
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,079
- That's the best thing I've
ever had in my whole life.

352
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,647
- Kim, I'll give you
seven grand for half.

353
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,748
- I'll give you five just
for the potatoes.

354
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:50,983
- (Probst) I don't think

355
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,117
she's hearing any
of you guys right now.

356
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,352
- I don't think she
hears a thing.

357
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,586
- Teresa, I'll sell
you a piece of chicken.

358
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,221
- How much, Kim?

359
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,058
- Well, this cost me a lot.
4,000 for a piece of chicken.

360
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,159
- I'll do it for five.

361
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,293
- Lex will
do it for five.

362
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,594
- 5,500.

363
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,530
- I'll give you six for
that piece of chicken.

364
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,764
- Six for the chicken.

365
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,999
Do I hear seven?

366
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,067
Do I hear seven?

367
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,168
- T-Bird.

368
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,336
Go and get yourself
that chicken.

369
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,403
- 6,500?

370
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,404
Do I hear seven?

371
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,739
- No, I'll hold out.

372
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,074
- (Probst) Teresa, what are
you holding out for?

373
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,108
- Fried chicken
and potatoes.

374
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,710
- It's here.

375
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,545
- That has Georgia
written all over it.

376
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,646
- And a bite of potatoes?

377
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,349
- A bite of potatoes
for 75-- 8,000

378
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,384
for the potatoes, two bites of
potatoes and the chicken.

379
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,552
- Go, Teresa, what else are you
going to buy?

380
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,619
- I- Okay. it.

381
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,754
- 8500.

382
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,922
- 8,00- 8,500. once.

383
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,190
No, no, you got 8500.

384
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,858
- 10 for half the potatoes
and that chicken.

385
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,361
That means you only paid
2,000 for it.

386
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,364
- Okay, 10 for half the
potatoes and the chicken.

387
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,599
- Do I hear 10,500?

388
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,835
Going once, going twice...

389
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:43,936
- Let me help you, Kim.

390
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,037
Sold.

391
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,373
- Sold to the man.

392
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,440
- Mmm.

393
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,309
- Is that delicious?

394
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,010
- (Probst) Next item...

395
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,212
should I keep it as a mystery or
tell you what it is?

396
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,380
- No, no.
Show it to us.

397
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,414
- (Probst) Okay.

398
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,448
- Oh, yeah!

399
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,516
- Go, baby, that's good.

400
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,550
You be the bid.
You just go.

401
00:16:58,617 --> 00:16:59,785
- (Probst) That's a hoagie.

402
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,454
- Oh, God, and it has
provolone cheese on it.

403
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,555
- Teresa, bid.

404
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,990
- (Probst) Let's start
this at 9,000.

405
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,058
- 9,000.

406
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,159
- (Probst) 9,000 to Teresa.

407
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,193
Is it time
to pool money?

408
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,228
Get creative.

409
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,295
- Move along, move along.

410
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,031
- This auction
will not go on forever.

411
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,066
- Ten.

412
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,067
- (Probst) 10 to Big Tom.

413
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,468
- 10,500.

414
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,503
- (Probst) 10,500 to Teresa.

415
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,570
- 11,500.

416
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,638
- (Probst) 11,500.

417
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,672
- Splitting it?

418
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,707
- Twelve.

419
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,741
- (Probst) 12 to Big Tom.

420
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,143
- - 13.0.

421
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,277
- 13,500.

422
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,179
- 14,500.

423
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,547
- (Probst) 14 to Big Tom,
14,500, Teresa.

424
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,382
- (Probst- 15,500.to Teresa.

425
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,051
- (Probst) - 16.0 to Teresa.

426
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,020
- (Probs- 16,500.big Tom.

427
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,889
- Give me a thousand,
I'll quit bidding.

428
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,991
- Nope.

429
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,959
- You tapped out,
Big Tom?

430
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,294
- I've met my limit.

431
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:46,565
- (Probst) 16,500 to Teresa--
going once, twice, sold.

432
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,833
Come up and
have a bite, woman.

433
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,301
Finally, you're in
this game.

434
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,469
- Yay, Teresa.

435
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,470
- Good job, "T."

436
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,705
- How good is it?

437
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:58,177
- Good enough to make you want
to slap your mama.

438
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,379
- Let's make this
a mystery item.

439
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,881
Let's start the bidding
at 9,000 shillings.

440
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,916
- You want to split it?

441
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,851
- Nine.

442
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,186
- 9,000 to Big Tom.

443
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,288
Anybody else want
in on this?

444
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,090
Mystery item.

445
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,793
Sold to Big Tom
for 9,000.

446
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,061
Now, I did you
right last time.

447
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,129
- You really did.

448
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,230
- (Probst)
Okay, so we're even.

449
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,331
- All right.

450
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,933
- (Probst)
Take a look.

451
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,035
Open that baby up.

452
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,504
- He did me wrong.
I'll kill you.

453
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:29,741
I'll kill you, I'll kill you,
after I kiss you.

454
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,044
- Whoo!

455
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,545
- Ham.

456
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,215
He's a Jew, and he won't
eat the ham.

457
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,883
He's a Jew.

458
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,586
He's a Jew.

459
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,587
- (Probst) Big Tom, wait.

460
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,622
Big Tom, come here.

461
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,591
Whoa, be careful.

462
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,826
I just want to
see you enjoy this.

463
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,828
- He won't eat the ham.

464
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,563
-- Thank you.

465
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,031
- That's all right.

466
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,167
- (Probst) Half that meal that
he just split with you he's not

467
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,301
going to eat.

468
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,503
- He won't eat that.

469
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,904
I mean I hate it
for him.

470
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,105
I hate it for him.

471
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,640
I wished he would.

472
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,809
- (Probst) Ethan, get down here
and take a little bite of this.

473
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,211
- I'll spend every penny
I got and I don't care.

474
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,513
Good buy, my friend.

475
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,914
- (Probst) Here's your syrup.

476
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,249
- We hit the jackpot.

477
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,984
- Yeah, we did.

478
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,052
- (Probst) My friends,
that's it.

479
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,320
The auction is closed.

480
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,856
Hope you had fun.

481
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,725
- I did.

482
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,493
I did.

483
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,584
- That chicken, I think
I just lost it.

484
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,253
I haven't been that excited
since the bow and arrow.

485
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,656
- I cannot believe
I had a pot of chocolate.

486
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,658
- That damn beer was good.

487
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,295
- In the food auction, you
could definitely see alliance

488
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,632
lines and relationship lines
that apply to the game itself.

489
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,968
I mean, Kim and I have been
close since the get-go.

490
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,903
Tom and Ethan
have been very close too.

491
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,139
T. Bird and Frank,
no surprise there.

492
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,107
They've really only got
each other at this point.

493
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,043
And also, it was kind of
painfully obvious

494
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,546
that Kim Powers is
kind of on her own.

495
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,381
But there are people
taking care of her there.

496
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,816
- Thanks, Big Tom.

497
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,919
- I remember you sitting there,
and the last thing you said,

498
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,055
"Oh, what I'd give for
ice cream," and I went...

499
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,726
- It was interesting to
see who's a more clever and

500
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,161
shrewd wheeler and dealer.

501
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:32,497
Tom probably walked away the
biggest winner as far as food.

502
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,966
- Pancake, did you
like the pancake?

503
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,200
- Yeah, really.

504
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,235
I made out like
a bandit.

505
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,238
- You got
your ham, Big Tom.

506
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,676
- Tom, he is not the most
politically correct human being,

507
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,511
so when he said that he was
sharing the ham with

508
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,146
a Jew boy, knowing that
he wasn't going to eat it,

509
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,948
I was like,
"Oh, my God."

510
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:50,983
- I'm sorry.

511
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,217
- Yeah, that was...

512
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,186
- I'm a Caucasian,
call me anything.

513
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:55,954
What am I?

514
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,390
C- A bigot..

515
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,425
- What is a bigot?

516
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,494
- I mean, at this point,
I don't really take offense.

517
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,662
I know he's joking.

518
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,896
You know, he doesn't
really mean it.

519
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,203
- Man, you can
play some checkers.

520
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:15,040
He thinks a lot
before he moves.

521
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,943
- Me and Tom, we have kind of
like almost like a brotherly

522
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,444
relationship right now.

523
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,647
He makes fun of me 'cause I'm
Jewish and I make fun of him

524
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,415
'cause he's fat and he's
got a boil on his neck

525
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,251
and there's just, like,
competition, you know,

526
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,586
he's going to
beat me at checkers.

527
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,924
Oh... man.

528
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,960
- Don't do that.

529
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,304
- He's a checker shark.

530
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,839
- I go back and forth on
whether or not I think Tom is

531
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,776
for real or some of it's put on,
because I think he's smarter

532
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:54,246
than he lets on.

533
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:55,514
- Stupid me.

534
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,918
- Tommy, he plays a good old
boy, but I don't think he's as

535
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:04,089
backwoods-ish as he would like
to make you think.

536
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,490
- Checkmate.

537
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,793
- We're just
totally done already?

538
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,027
- Yeah.

539
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,128
- Oh, my God,
that's pathetic.

540
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,130
- He's very good.

541
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,166
- You know, his whole, you
know, "I'm a hayseed from

542
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,467
Virginia, I'm not
that smart."

543
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,804
I knew quickly that he was a lot
brighter than he let on.

544
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,540
And actually, I mean that
endeared me to him and intrigued

545
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,141
me all the more.

546
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,010
- What do you two
think you're doing?

547
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,111
- You're both going
forward.

548
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,446
- You're back to back.

549
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,815
- Well, the door's
this way.

550
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,516
- That's funny.

551
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,218
- Are you
all right now?

552
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,287
- Yeah.

553
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,137
- Are they zebra?

554
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,238
- Yeah,
those are zebra.

555
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,675
- That's a nice, little herd,
ain't it?

556
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,276
- Yeah, a big herd.

557
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,411
- Thundering herd.

558
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,255
- Hey, mama cat,
bring it on up here.

559
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,424
- Okay.

560
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,527
- We have been kind of in
a routine, so today, to keep

561
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,763
things fresh, we went to our
watering hole, put our stuff

562
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:22,400
down and Big Tom
gave everyone a little shower.

563
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,635
- Oh, man.

564
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:24,770
- Tommy, I'll take a shower.

565
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,372
- Okay, brother.

566
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,609
- We have been here a while,
and we were getting pretty

567
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:31,943
comfortable with each other,

568
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,645
and I can change
without being too

569
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,080
worried if anyone sees me.

570
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,617
You know, I can fart, you know,
and not really care.

571
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,289
- All right,
girls, back off.

572
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,291
- You can douse me.

573
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,628
When you spend 30 days with
people in very close proximity,

574
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,165
you're not ashamed or bashful of
just about anything anymore.

575
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,734
I mean, we've lived together
closer than most families live

576
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,204
together and bathing or
whatever, it just seems like

577
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,506
it's something that you kind of
have to do it, and you really

578
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,908
don't care who
sees you anymore.

579
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:11,883
- Tom's loving
every minute of it.

580
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,287
- Woo-hoo, does that
feel good!

581
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,755
- Tom gets away with murder.

582
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,024
Like today, you know, he was
having a good time bathing the

583
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,161
ladies, having them kind of pull
their bathing suits back.

584
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,034
- Don't think Tom doesn't
know what he's doing.

585
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,836
- Tom's not washing you...

586
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,339
at all.

587
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,774
- I mean,
Tommy's harmless.

588
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,542
It's not, like, he's going to,
like, jump our bones there

589
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,944
or anything.

590
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,478
He's really harmless and if he
gets a peek, you know,

591
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,513
more power to him.

592
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,181
It doesn't do
any good for anybody

593
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,649
to take offense at
anybody.

594
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,985
It only costs you friendship,
and this whole exercise out here

595
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,354
I think is about getting along
with people and just going

596
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,755
with the flow.

597
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,524
- One for the road!

598
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,096
- Encore!

599
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,799
- We have been here a while and
we're getting pretty comfortable

600
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,768
with each other, and it's like
your family now.

601
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,705
And it makes everything a little
more difficult because tomorrow,

602
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,807
I'm going to have to vote
one of these people off.

603
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:22,120
- (Probst) Hey, guys, welcome to
this abandoned boma.

604
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,756
You'll be playing
today's challenge here.

605
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,958
As always, first
things first.

606
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,127
I'll take this back.

607
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,229
Immunity is back
up for grabs.

608
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,166
Okay.

609
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:38,069
Today's challenge is going to
test how well you remember

610
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,672
the African story
I'm about to tell you.

611
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,275
But first, here's what
you'll have to do.

612
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,044
We've set up seven gated
stations, and only one person at

613
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,712
a time can be there,

614
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,482
so make sure you
close the gate behind you.

615
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,684
Each station has a question and
two ostrich eggs.

616
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,786
Break open the egg
for the correct answer.

617
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,755
You'll find a piece of
colored leather.

618
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,723
Wrap that around
the same color on your staff.

619
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,458
If you answer incorrectly,
you'll find nothing, you'll have

620
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,960
to try again later.

621
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,896
The eggs will be replaced after
each person leaves the station.

622
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,399
First person back in the circle
with five of the seven questions

623
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:11,303
answered correctly and five
pieces of leather on their staff

624
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,004
wins immunity.

625
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,873
Okay, story time.

626
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,242
Today, I'm going to tell you
about the Samburu warrior.

627
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,912
When a baby boy is born,
his destiny is already planned.

628
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,416
To celebrate the birth,
a goat is sacrificed.

629
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,184
The women of the tribe eat
the meat of the goat because

630
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,286
the women are the caretakers
of the tribe.

631
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,823
For the first four days after
the birth, the mother drinks

632
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,625
only the blood
of the goat.

633
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,327
Around the age
of nine or ten,

634
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,862
the boy has his first
rite of passage.

635
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,699
This is the removal of his two
bottom middle teeth because if

636
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,069
he were to get sick and they
needed to get food or water into

637
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,438
his body, they use the gap from
the two missing teeth as a way

638
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,806
to do that.

639
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,075
It's also around this time that
he begins the practice of

640
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,242
piercing his ears.

641
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,811
This is the first cosmetic
enhancement.

642
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:56,348
His next rite of passage is a
circumcision, and that begins

643
00:26:56,414 --> 00:27:00,618
with a journey
to find gum from a special tree.

644
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,621
It could take him as long 45
days, during which he can only

645
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,191
subsist on
the generosity of others--

646
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,360
the food that he gets
along the way.

647
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,028
Once he's
completed his mission,

648
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,130
a date for the circumcision
is set.

649
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,833
Dates are scheduled
based on the new moon.

650
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,770
The tribe will wait for any
even-numbered day of moonlight.

651
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,539
Eighth day, considered
the best day.

652
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,309
In preparation for a
circumcision, shaves his head.

653
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,344
But the most important aspect
to a circumcision

654
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,046
is a warrior's reaction.

655
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,216
If, during the circumcision,
he flinches in any way,

656
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,118
he and his
family are forever shamed.

657
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,786
After eight years of
warriorship,

658
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,821
he's eligible
for marriage.

659
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,924
Tribal custom demands that he
continue to have kids until he

660
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,328
has a boy, even if that means
taking another wife and another.

661
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,996
The last step: Death.

662
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,433
Once a warrior is close to
death, he is taken into the bush

663
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,503
with another warrior
and left to die.

664
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,240
Once he dies, fellow warriors
shave their heads out of

665
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,309
respect, and his body is
left for the hyenas to eat.

666
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,979
From birth to death,
a hard life.

667
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,048
Now we're going to see
what you've learned.

668
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,382
Grab your staffs
and let's get it on.

669
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,921
Survivors ready?

670
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,323
Go!

671
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,993
Make sure
you close your gates.

672
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,937
- Food provided by others.

673
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:33,244
- "What happens
after a warrior dies?"

674
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,357
- Oh, hell.

675
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,160
Well, I can't cry over spilt
milk.

676
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,595
I missed it.

677
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,198
- (Probst) Frank and Lex,
each with one.

678
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,107
- "Reaction of
the warrior."

679
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:08,446
- "What must be done
when a child is born?"

680
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:22,293
- (Probst) Lex, Frank and
Kim Johnson all have one.

681
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,702
- "Eighth day of moonlight."

682
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,407
- "The reaction
of the warrior."

683
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:40,311
- (Probst) Teresa and Kim Powers
now also have one.

684
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,980
- "First act of tribal
beautification is: removal of

685
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,748
"the two bottom teeth,
piercing of the ear.

686
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:44,749
Piercing of the ear."

687
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:53,625
- (Probst) Lex and Frank
in the lead with two each.

688
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,427
- Oh, hell.

689
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,496
That ain't right.

690
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,669
- "Body left in the bush
for hyenas to eat."

691
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,172
Or maybe not!

692
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,184
- "Shave his head."

693
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,158
- (Probst) Lex and Frank
lead with four.

694
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,694
Everybody else at three.

695
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,740
- (Probst) You got it, Lex?

696
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,542
- One, two, three, four.

697
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,044
I dropped one.

698
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,178
- (Probst) Gotta find it, Lex.

699
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,546
Gotta find it.

700
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:52,217
Lex says he has five,
but he can't find his fifth.

701
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,262
Get it on there, baby.

702
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,766
Lex trying to get his
in the right spot.

703
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,336
We're still alive.

704
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,804
- God.

705
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,740
I've got to be careful.

706
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,276
- Lex wins
immunity again.

707
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,352
Lex, again, you're not
going down.

708
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,420
Con- Thanks.ons.

709
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,289
- (Probst) You're safe
from the vote.

710
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,391
Somebody else
is going home.

711
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,826
I'll see you
at Tribal Council.

712
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,190
- To be here is just awesome.

713
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,661
This morning's sunrise is just,
is just, so beautiful.

714
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,129
You know, I don't think the
majority of people in our

715
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:15,366
everyday, busy lives take a
moment to just watch something

716
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,636
as beautiful as that, and to
suddenly realize just how small

717
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,873
we are in the world, and how
time can just pass by in a

718
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,841
moment and we
would be gone.

719
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,277
You know, it puts your life
back in perspective.

720
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,181
- Nice sunrise.

721
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,583
- Oh, my God.

722
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,953
- Look at that.

723
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,923
- My love for being here grows
every day.

724
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,759
Just loving the outdoors, you
know, and the animals and

725
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:45,396
wildlife and people in a way, as
well, you know, I love to mingle

726
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,397
with people.

727
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,232
Good morning, Ethan.

728
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,334
- Good morning.

729
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,269
- H- Good.you?

730
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,370
- Breakfast.

731
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,438
- Are we having soup?

732
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,539
- Uh-huh.

733
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:55,740
- I love your soup.

734
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,375
-- I love the soup.

735
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,443
- Good.

736
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,844
Good, good, good.

737
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,179
- As always, very tasty.

738
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,680
I mean, really.

739
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:07,618
- It's just a beautiful
morning, so I was just adding to

740
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:11,689
the wonderful atmosphere and
just socializing and, you know,

741
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,793
let them see there's a soft,
sensual side of me.

742
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,197
My argument always with the
gun, you know, activist, is that

743
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:22,266
they think that guns
kill people.

744
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,470
There's, like... there's
everything else you could kill

745
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,904
someone with, you know, a piece
of fishing line I can kill

746
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:27,972
somebody with.

747
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,407
- Hit them over the head
with a brick.

748
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,476
- You know, automobiles kill
people every day, drug overdose,

749
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,978
malpractice,
just everything.

750
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,980
- All right, enough.

751
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,248
- Frank seems really
rambunctious this morning

752
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,950
and he's talking a lot.

753
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:42,453
And he's a very opinionated
person, which is fine, but,

754
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,289
like, when you have immunity at
stake, you kind of just need to

755
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,424
keep your mouth shut.

756
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,892
- I can't help it.

757
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,894
These little, liberal special
interest groups that the media

758
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,863
give open market to instead of
the average working-class

759
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,297
Americans that
founded this country.

760
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,133
- All right! All right!

761
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,467
- Well, what can I say
about Frank?

762
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,503
Once again, Frank is Frank.

763
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,505
- You know, Ray might
invite me to their banquet,

764
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,206
their convention
down there.

765
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,474
- Perfect.

766
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,276
- He brings up
this gun stuff.

767
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,079
And Lex is going
like this, you know.

768
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,047
Ethan's sitting over there, not
saying a word, but I can tell

769
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,349
it's getting to him, too.

770
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,051
And I'm thinking to myself,
Frank, cut it, stop.

771
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,621
Why is it on the days that you
need to be most careful of how

772
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:20,158
you act and what you say, Frank,
like, goes off on the A.R. or

773
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,659
whatever stuff?

774
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,060
- Yeah.

775
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,996
Well, that's just the way...
he ain't going to change.

776
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,500
- Today is
Tribal Council day.

777
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,436
Today is the day
that you don't

778
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,671
want to really
ruffle any feathers.

779
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,774
But, you know, I started out
from the very beginning with an

780
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,443
alliance with
Frank, and shoot,

781
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,912
I've been here for
this many days.

782
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,580
I'm sure not
going to give up now.

783
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,252
- This is all going exactly
as we wanted it to.

784
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,956
Things couldn't
be any better.

785
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,959
- The guys have dominated
the game.

786
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,461
They're saying who goes next.

787
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,464
If nothing else, I'd like to see
the women get in there.

788
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,265
- Right.

789
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,500
- Teresa doesn't
want to give up,

790
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,868
and I don't want
to give up either.

791
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,304
So, Teresa is, like, trying to
scramble and figure out

792
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,972
it there's
anything that we can do.

793
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,975
- Ethan's going to take
the whole thing.

794
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,043
He's great.

795
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,878
What can you say
negative about Ethan?

796
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,413
Nothing.

797
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,182
- It's a shot in the dark, but
if I can persuade Kim to vote

798
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,018
off Ethan, that would break up
that alliance.

799
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,854
- If Ethan's not here...

800
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,189
- That would leave Kim,
you, me and Frank.

801
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,357
- You, me and Frank.

802
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,992
- And then you're going to
stick by Frank.

803
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,460
- No.

804
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,731
If you do this tonight, then
I'll pledge my loyalty to you.

805
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,168
It could hurt me going to Kim,
but Ethan's bonded with those

806
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,103
guys, and they're going to be
strong enough every time they

807
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,038
vote to weed off
one more of us.

808
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,542
So it's kind of a risk, but at
this point, I feel like this is

809
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,511
the only chance I've got.

810
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,513
- I was really
shocked and pissed

811
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,114
that they would even,
you know....

812
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,148
- Well, they're cornered.

813
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,184
They have
no options.

814
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,220
- Teresa approached me with the
idea that Tommy, Lex and Ethan

815
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,724
really don't have any kind of
allegiance toward me,

816
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,960
but I just can't
turn on Ethan at this point.

817
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,696
So I'm going to have to tell
Teresa that, and I'm not sure

818
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,765
what the reaction is
going to be to that.

819
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,734
I just think, so really, that I
think I might still be shooting

820
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,636
myself in the foot, even if I
could bring myself to it do it.

821
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,538
- Okay, I understand.

822
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:18,543
I just appreciate you're telling
us so we can do different stuff.

823
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,212
- I had an opportunity,
obviously, to do something to

824
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,713
save them, and I didn't
do that.

825
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,383
And now I'm afraid
it's going to hurt me.

826
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,451
- This plan's not coming
together.

827
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,787
- I know it's not.

828
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,156
- So, it'll be an interesting
Tribal Council.

829
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,240
- (Probst) We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.

830
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,684
30 days.

831
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,887
Congratulations.

832
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,088
You made it a long ways.

833
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,090
Basically a month
out here on your own.

834
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:11,228
Well, obviously, from this point
forward, the power shifts from

835
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:14,532
the tribe members left
to the jury that is growing.

836
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,835
Your dilemma is obvious: How can
you vote somebody out of this

837
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,705
game, take that million dollars
out of their hand and then ask

838
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,007
them to put it in your hands
by voting you most deserving?

839
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,743
Teresa, what goes through your
head now as you show up tonight

840
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,044
and here's Brandon
and Kelly?

841
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,913
People you had
a hand in voting out,

842
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,247
you're going to need
them later.

843
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:34,218
- For me, I guess it takes just
the way I play the game,

844
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,453
trying to be as
honest with everybody,

845
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,789
you know, that I could be,
so at this point,

846
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,625
it's just playing as
fair as I can and hope that

847
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,828
they'll respect, you know, my
decisions and how I played.

848
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,697
- (Probst) Ethan, one of you
seven is going tonight.

849
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,034
Next Tribal Council, they'll be
sitting over there.

850
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,036
How can you vote them out

851
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,904
and ask them to vote
for you at the end?

852
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:58,142
- Well, you've just got to hope
that what you did before the

853
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:03,047
vote and how you treated people
before the vote will, you know,

854
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,782
put you in a good light.

855
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,219
It is just a game,
and if you get voted out,

856
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,520
it's just a
strategy.

857
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,023
You've got to look out
for yourself in the end.

858
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,992
- (Probst) Lex, how close is
this game to turning ugly?

859
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,262
- I think the game has already
gone through some ugly times.

860
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,431
I think it's taken
a turn for the better.

861
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,400
It's probably going to
get ugly again.

862
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,002
But everyone here, whether
they're, you know, sitting up

863
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,472
here or on the jury, realizes,
though, that they came to play

864
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,874
a game and to win.

865
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,377
And you can do that with
integrity, but to come in here

866
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,380
thinking that it's never going
to be, you know,

867
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:40,551
just a bones-to-bones
competition is to be naive.

868
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,087
- (Probst) Frank, do you feel
like it's still the old Samburu

869
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,056
and the old Boran when it comes
down to voting?

870
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,692
- Not really because the game
is changing, you know.

871
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,760
I think those old
tribal names are gone.

872
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,697
Our tribe had a new name,
everyone belonged to it.

873
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:57,034
I think it's a strategy within
the new tribe.

874
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,904
- (Probst) Kim, do you feel that
you might be safer because maybe

875
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,239
people don't see you as such a
physical threat,

876
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,241
or are you worried that
maybe you're too likable

877
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,242
and, therefore, you've
got to go?

878
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,711
- I'm always worried.

879
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,380
I think I would be worried if
I were strong and I'm worried

880
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,048
because I'm not so strong.

881
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,516
It doesn't matter
how nice I am

882
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,652
or how weak I am or
how strong I am.

883
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,254
If I'm the logical
person to go, I'm going.

884
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,190
- All right, it's time
to vote.

885
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,025
Lex is the only
one you can't vote for.

886
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,093
Everybody else
is fair game.

887
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,794
Kim, you're up first.

888
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,172
- I've enjoyed you as a person,
but we have to vote somebody off

889
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,341
and you're my
next logical choice.

890
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,576
I'll miss you, though.

891
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,727
- It's been good for me to be
around someone so different from

892
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,162
myself and learn from you.

893
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,165
I'm glad that we actually got to
spend some time together.

894
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,821
- This is not
a vote of betrayal.

895
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,689
This is a vote
of strategy.

896
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,160
Frank, thank you so much
for the friendship.

897
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,309
- I'll go tally the votes.

898
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,868
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

899
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,236
The person will be asked

900
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,637
to leave the Tribal Council
area immediately.

901
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,705
I'll read the votes.

902
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:20,144
First vote: Frank.

903
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,152
Kim Johnson.

904
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,324
Frank.

905
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:39,697
Frank.

906
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,233
Three votes Frank,
one vote Kim.

907
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,341
Frank.

908
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:51,408
That's enough, Frank.

909
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,810
You need to bring me
your torch.

910
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:00,851
Frank, the tribe
has spoken.

911
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,526
It's time for you to go.

912
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,036
You guys can head
back to camp.

913
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,286
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

914
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,088
- (Probst) Next time
on<i> Survivor:</i>

915
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,657
Teresa pushes the
all-girl alliance.

916
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,393
- I really don't want to see
the guys come down to the end.

917
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,861
- Bye, babies.

918
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,864
- (Probst) The members of Moto
Maji get videos from home.

919
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,934
And the winner
of the reward challenge

920
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,503
takes the trip of a
lifetime.

921
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,347
- To my lovely wife, Polly,
and my daughters, Jocelyn Rose

922
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,848
and Sage Hunter.

923
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,218
Thank you for your unselfish
sacrifices you made so I could

924
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,687
go on this adventure.

925
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:14,358
I give you my word of honor that
down the road, I will make

926
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,193
all your dreams come true.

927
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,463
As your husband, as your father
and as your friend, I love you

928
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,731
and I miss you,
thank you.
