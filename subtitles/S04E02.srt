1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,169
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,464
<i>Survivor,</i> 16 strangers were
abandoned on a remote island in

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,216
the South Pacific.
Both tribes were stunned to

4
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,594
learn they had been given no
food and no water.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,930
>> We knew that if we didn't
work as a team, one of us was

6
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,474
going to starve to death.
>> JEFF: Hunter emerged as the

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,309
disputed leader of the Maraamu
tribe.

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,980
>> I'm an alpha male, too.
He's not my daddy.

9
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,108
>> JEFF: And Kathy's attempts to
lead the Rotu tribe were also

10
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,234
met with resistance.
>> How many hours I spent

11
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,112
yesterday, I'm wiped.
>> I am not trying to be pushy.

12
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,115
>> JEFF: Maraamu got fire the
first night, and things heated

13
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,076
up between Rob and Sarah.
>> Are they flirting or are they

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,579
making an alliance?
>> JEFF: A fatal mistake cost

15
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:41,416
Maraamu their first challenge.
And Rotu claimed victory and

16
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,960
immunity.
Maraamu went to Tribal Council,

17
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,171
where Peter was the first person
voted out of the tribe.

18
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:51,426
Peter, the tribe has spoken.
15 are left.

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,510
Who will be voted out tonight?

20
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,588
>> One big line and massage
each other. A massage circle.

21
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,883
>> This is how Rotu stays
together.

22
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,885
>> That's right.
>> That's exactly right.

23
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,388
>> You guys, we're going to do
this every night, I swear...

24
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,766
>> I agree.
>> Oh, look at those stars, you

25
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,437
guys, it's just awesome.
>> I love being in this tribe.

26
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,233
I love everyone's spirit out
here and how they decide to

27
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,360
interact with each other, in
positive ways.

28
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,696
>> Good night.
>> I'll tell you what, any of

29
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,699
this group could win, it'd
tickle the hell out of me.

30
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:41,411
>> This is most definitely the
love shack for our little love

31
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:46,916
tribe.
But Kathy isn't trying to be one

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,213
of us, to get along with us.
She sleeps alone out by the

33
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:58,344
fire.
(rooster crowing)

34
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,273
>> Being out here is really
about being part of a group,

35
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,442
especially in the beginning.
I mean, first impressions are

36
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,946
the most important.
And Kathy chooses to sleep, you

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,324
know, by herself.
>> I mean there's just an

38
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,076
unwritten rule.
>> I think she's out by herself

39
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,872
fishing right now.
>> It's only the fourth day, and

40
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,416
we don't have any food.
I mean, the ocean has food in

41
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,795
it, so I knew it was out here
somewhere, but I never turned

42
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,340
over rocks in my lifetime to
find food.

43
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,135
But this will give me some
credibility today, because then

44
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,888
maybe then they'll listen to me
when I tell them it's going to

45
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:47,310
rain, and we are going to be
miserable in that terrible hut.

46
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,484
>> Rob has been struggling the
last couple days, he's been

47
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,486
pretty sick, not being able to
help us out very much.

48
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,157
>> Being a big guy comes with
needing a lot of food.

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,869
>> How you doing, man, better?
>> I think it's taken the

50
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:09,123
biggest toll on him not having
what he's used to.

51
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,001
>> I tried to make them all
the same size, you know?

52
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,004
>> Since we've been out here, I
don't think any of us have had

53
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,673
any protein.
We're going to change that

54
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,341
today.
We're going to do something.

55
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,343
>> I think I would like to get
either a pig or a chicken,

56
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,471
because I really need to sink my
teeth into some sort of meat.

57
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:29,852
>> We know that there's food out
there, and we have to use what

58
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,356
nature has given us to create
different weapons.

59
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,151
>> Needs some work.
>> Fish hooks from an Acacia

60
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,571
tree, fishing spears.
>> I got this tubing, kept it on

61
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,409
the back of my sunglasses to
keep them from falling off my

62
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,202
head.
Too low.

63
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,538
>> Oh, my gosh.
>> Okay, hold on.

64
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,499
One of the more creative things
that I came up with was my own

65
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,583
shrimp catcher.
Oh, shut up.

66
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,545
>> Oh, you are kidding me.
>> But our biggest one is we

67
00:04:55,628 --> 00:05:00,508
have a pig snare.
So we pull this down.

68
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:06,014
>> Oh, that will work perfect!
>> If I catch a pig, you know, I

69
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,392
might as well set my table at
the final four.

70
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,479
>> Yay!
>> We're going to get a pig!

71
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,907
>> Let's get a weather report.
Somebody turn on the weather

72
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,077
station.
You got today's weather report,

73
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,246
Hunter?
>> Hold on, let me turn to the

74
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,082
station.
>> Mother Earth, Hunter Ellis

75
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,836
with today's morning weather!
>> Today's Marquesas weather

76
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,547
report coming to you live from
Happiness Cove in the Marquesan

77
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,259
Islands.
Right now, it's partly sunny,

78
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,596
temperatures in the mid 80s, but
it will reach a blistering 160

79
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:51,559
degrees according to Rob today.
(laughter)

80
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,603
>> We start off every day with a
morning show.

81
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,605
Sean runs the show,
I'm in charge of the food

82
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,607
portion.
>> Let's hear today's food

83
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,610
review, Rob.
>> Today, we're going to be

84
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,946
starting off with blueberry
pancakes, bacon and sausage.

85
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,993
Woo! Yeah!
>> The morning show is basically

86
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,913
our break from the day.
And it's our little bit of comic

87
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,458
relief for everybody before we
get into the toiling world of

88
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,421
surviving here in the Marquesas.
>> Nice catch!

89
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,011
>> Oh, yeah.
>> You know, I think most normal

90
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,806
people that go camping, you
know, take along their little

91
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,809
gas stoves and their heaters and
their tents and they think,

92
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,602
"Yeah, I can do it, I can camp."
We have nothing.

93
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:39,649
If we have little ones to build
it up, it makes it more sturdy.

94
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,485
>> There are a number of
contributors in the camp, Mama,

95
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,655
who you would think would be the
least likely maybe is one of the

96
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,658
strongest.
>> What's that like a box, mom?

97
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,618
>> Well, I'm trying to build us
a chicken trap.

98
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:55,081
I've never done this before, but
I got a concept up here.

99
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,334
I'm trying to put to use.
>> Miss Trisha has definitely

100
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,503
changed since the last Tribal
Council.

101
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,839
When we got back, it was a
totally different thing the next

102
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,841
morning.
She was up, she was collecting

103
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,510
firewood, she won't sit down,
she won't rest.

104
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,847
>> What did I say?
I'll help you, let me move the

105
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,014
water.
>> I think that she's being

106
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,518
herself now, at first she was
just a little scared she was

107
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,062
going to get voted off and now
she's in it and she's

108
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,730
comfortable.
>> Put it on my back, please,

109
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,524
since you got it on your hands.
>> Notice she didn't ask us?

110
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,068
>> He has it on his hands.
Yeah.

111
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,697
Be sure to go up underneath the
bathing suit.

112
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,076
>> Pervert!
>> Rub it on there, go ahead.

113
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,206
>> I need it, y'all, I burn.
>> That's nasty.

114
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:47,258
Go underneath, underneath.
>> I knew it was going to work!

115
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:54,891
Go underneath, underneath.
>> I knew it was going to work!

116
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,726
I knew it!
>> What you got, guys?

117
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,769
>> Anything?
>> Got a shrimp.

118
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,897
>> No, really?
>> Yes I did.

119
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,442
>> Look it all that meat.
>> Look at that.

120
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,155
>> Within the tribe, you're
trying to develop a hierarchy.

121
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,865
I want to be as high as
possible.

122
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:11,908
The highest place, really, I
think that you can be is to

123
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,870
provide food for the tribe,
specifically protein.

124
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,789
>> Good job, John.
>> All we need is like 30 more.

125
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,794
>> Hey, you guys get out here.
I'm serious!

126
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,756
(whistles)
Look what I'm finding, these

127
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,927
shells!
Aah!

128
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,556
>> What did you find?
>> Look! Oh, my God!

129
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,226
We found thousands of these
shells.

130
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,939
>> Kathy's borderline abrasive
as far as her communication

131
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,107
style.
And there's a little bit of

132
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,777
condescending behavior when she
talks to people.

133
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,946
>> Let me explain so we do this
right.

134
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,448
They're under the rocks.
So this is what I did, I flip

135
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:56,285
one of these and there would be
like two or three right there.

136
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,957
>> It was so exciting to see
food, even though it was minute,

137
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,128
I started losing it.
It's tribal!

138
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,673
>> You got it, don't drop them
whatever you do.

139
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:13,469
Way to go!
And they were excited and they

140
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,055
came out and they were flipping
rocks like mad trying to find

141
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,016
them.
>> We got seven-- one, two,

142
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,478
three, four.
It spit at me.

143
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,773
Is he even edible?
>> It's a delicacy, I think

144
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,110
we've got a delicacy here.
>> Inside, it was like a mixed

145
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,653
blessing for me.
Great, I'm happy to have the

146
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,656
protein.
I just wish I would have been

147
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,285
the one to find it.
>> We're going to be eating well

148
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:43,958
today.
>> All you got to do is take off

149
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,128
the little black part.
You pull out all the yucky

150
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,548
stuff, like it's heart, I don't
know what it really is, and then

151
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,675
you just wipe off all this black
stuff onto a leaf and you're

152
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,969
ready to go.
>> That is just nasty.

153
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,097
>> Like snot.
You want some slime?

154
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,642
>> We're going to chow down.
This guy's moving.

155
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:04,854
>> Here's our lunch guys.
How does it look?

156
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,857
>> It looks wonderful,
absolutely delicious.

157
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,359
>> It looks great.
>> I'm going back out there.

158
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,528
Yeah, there's more food to be
had.

159
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:18,492
>> You guys need one of these.
>> Ew, oh, that was slimy.

160
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,537
>> There's something hard in
there, you can't bite it.

161
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,999
>> Awesome.
>> Oh, God, that is like the

162
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,376
best thing ever.
>> The seafood buffet lifted

163
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,546
everybody's spirits up, and I
thought, "Well, this will give

164
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,174
me a point, you know.
I won't get voted off now.

165
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,885
I'm finding food."
But not once did they say "Way

166
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,222
to go, Kath, thanks Kath."
Good thing the rocks got

167
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,725
overturned, guys.
I got to tell you, you know what

168
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,393
you do, you just think outside
the box.

169
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,854
Pat on the back?
I didn't get one.

170
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:56,906
Weird. I mean I'm not that hard
to get along with.

171
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:12,838
Weird. I mean I'm not that hard
to get along with.

172
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,257
>> Here's the plan, y'all get

173
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,926
ready to go gather some coconuts
and we're going to finish

174
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,761
letting these...
>> How can we get coconuts

175
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,971
without a stick?
>> Well, he'll get you a stick.

176
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,934
He's a great stick hunter.
Work needs to get done, and if

177
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,813
somebody is not going to step up
to the plate, I don't mind

178
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,108
telling somebody, "Look, let's
go."

179
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,486
What do you think?
>> Well, one more layer of

180
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,321
bigger flatter rocks.
>> Isn't that what I just said?

181
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,949
I want to know what you thought.
>> That's what, I'm agreeing

182
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,993
with you is what I'm doing.
>> Come on, come on!

183
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,288
>> Patricia has some really
great ideas, she loves to nag

184
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,998
me, you know, she loves to nag
everybody.

185
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,126
I don't think that we
necessarily always need the

186
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,168
nagging, but I think that's
Patricia.

187
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,962
She likes to do that.
She's a mom and she's always

188
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,798
going to be a mom.
>> Ya'll we need to put

189
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,467
everything back where we get it.
Look, this is the tool tree.

190
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,970
We're going to leave the
machetes here, and this is the

191
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,432
spear, you know, so we keep the
tools.

192
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,601
>> She's doing too much talking
to me, like, at first, it was

193
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,437
endearing because it seemed
natural.

194
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,690
Now it seems like, "Oh no, Mama
got to work, Mama can't sit

195
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,316
down.
>> Listen to me, I'm only going

196
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,485
to tell you this once.
>> I heard it this morning

197
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,112
already once.
>> The tool tree.

198
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,823
>> I already know that.
I know everything needs to go

199
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:26,036
back where you found it.
>> Where's the knife then?

200
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,624
>> I think mama, a lot of her
stuff is merely a show, with all

201
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,835
this controlling-- now you make
sure that fire stays lit.

202
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,797
I'm going to go get some more...
That knife needs to be back over

203
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,007
there.
That's just played out.

204
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,967
>> None us are children here.
>> Right.

205
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,345
>> We didn't come here asking
your mama and daddy every time

206
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,724
you needed to do something.
>> Right, and quite frankly, I,

207
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,392
you know, I'm getting sick of
it.

208
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,895
>> It's nice to bond with
somebody who understands.

209
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,063
A lot of things are cultural.
You know, there are certain

210
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,900
things where black people we
don't even have to finish

211
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,527
thoughts and we already know
where we are.

212
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,364
Aside from us, the other five
are different, but the

213
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:08,662
commonality that bonds them is
that... is that.

214
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,666
>> Sean is what I call him
Malcolm Farrakhan.

215
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,463
He's got that Malcolm X militant
type brother, and then he's got

216
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:22,092
that real intelligent outspoken
type of young man.

217
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,638
>> Even the fact that you and I
sit here talking right now can

218
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,890
be perceived as that we're
strategizing.

219
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,602
>> Strategizing, mm-hmm.
>> Sometimes the game isn't

220
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,480
necessarily fair, because me and
her playing a whole nother

221
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,232
mental game that they don't even
know.

222
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,568
When you're a person of color
and you're the only one, you

223
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,070
have to play, and that's
something they don't even have

224
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,280
to worry about.
See, everybody can just be

225
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,532
themselves.
We have to be ourselves, but

226
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,743
then hold back a little bit.
And on top of that, she believes

227
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,995
in God, I believe in God and
we're bound by Christ and that's

228
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,583
a stronger bond, stronger than
race, stronger than anything.

229
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,919
>> I can just tell what people
are going to say.

230
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,172
>> Yeah, like those two
ungrateful Negroes.

231
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,676
I mean, you take them on an
island and they still complain.

232
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,761
I mean, where's your Al Sharpton
now?

233
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:09,098
He's not going to come out on
the beach and just...

234
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,138
>> We have some people here that
want to seriously play this game

235
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,683
and survive.
I think others are here because

236
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:58,188
they think it's a vacation.
>> Sean seems so strong

237
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,775
physically when you look at him
you're thinking, "Man the guy

238
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,111
is, you know, he's going to be
strong for us, he's going to do

239
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,615
this and that.
But he, he's lazy.

240
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,327
Need to go on another water run.
Sean's going to do that whether

241
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,040
he likes it or not.
>> I love everybody in the

242
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,835
tribe, but Sean just doesn't
seem to want to carry his

243
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,253
weight.
I think this one is empty.

244
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,797
When you're done with that,
would you mind running up there

245
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,257
and doing it?
I'm just a little beat.

246
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:37,978
>> Not at all.
>> I don't like Sean.

247
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,856
I just wish he'd work a little
bit more.

248
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,151
>> Being that everybody seems to
feel strongly about Hunter being

249
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,029
the leader, everybody is
gravitating towards him to make

250
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,240
sure he sees what they do and
their value and let me get cool

251
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,660
with Hunter.
And that's all part of the game.

252
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,246
But I'm not going to do it.
In the interest of us surviving,

253
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,582
we are a team.
So if I'm needed to go get

254
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,710
water, I'm going to get it.
But it's like I ain't kissing

255
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,880
nobody's butt and I'm going to
tell you that right now.

256
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:17,184
>> Gina, here's another one.
>> Where are Rob and Sarah?

257
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,230
>> You should have to say
where's one of them and then you

258
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,900
know where the other one is.
>> I call them Frik and Frak.

259
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:28,112
>> Barbie and Ken.
>> Me and Rob have more in

260
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:32,908
common than we do with anybody
else, so we just happen to want

261
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,244
to hang out together.
We're the two youngest people in

262
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,748
the tribe and we laugh at each
other's jokes and have a good

263
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,750
time.
I'm definitely attracted to Rob,

264
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,919
and him the same, he's told me
the same.

265
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:48,882
>> Sarah pulls Rob away from his
duties, if Rob lays down, Sarah

266
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,134
lays down.
If Rob goes in the water, Sarah

267
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,971
goes in the water.
I think that if Sarah were to

268
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,140
go, we may see more productivity
out of Rob.

269
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,196
>> Pretty much the only game I
got going on is with Sarah and

270
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,575
that cuts both ways.
At times, she can be an asset

271
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,120
because, basically, she'll vote
whatever way I tell her to vote,

272
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,956
but, at other times, it's like
I'm playing<i> Survivor</i> for two.

273
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,333
I have to constantly be watching
her, because she's not really

274
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,129
doing too much around here.
You have to do work.

275
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:32,593
>> I have been.
>> I know. I know.

276
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,471
You don't understand these
people.

277
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,474
You know what I'm saying?
Just make sure they know that

278
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,978
you're doing something.
I picked her for a reason,

279
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:47,316
because it's like if I have one
vote, I really have two votes as

280
00:17:47,399 --> 00:18:00,662
long as I have her along.
(snorting, grunting)

281
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,706
>> You know something good's
going to happen tonight.

282
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,959
We're either going to catch a
pig or we are going to starve.

283
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,337
>> I'm thinking about bacon man,
that sounds so good.

284
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,593
>> I'm, like, totally stoked.
It worked.

285
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,347
We just got to do it better.
So we build this snare, and the

286
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,599
pig sets it off, we don't catch
the pig.

287
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,351
>> That's a big track right
there.

288
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,355
>> Inside, I was like bummed.
It's like going out fishing and

289
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,316
having a fish take your worm, I
mean, it simply was as close as

290
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:34,321
that.
>> We need more than three

291
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,823
people to go get water.
(whistling)

292
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,535
>> Uh, oh, they found something.
>> I want to have a little

293
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,372
meeting to introduce my goodies.
It's good news.

294
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:48,377
It was almost like a mother
holding a chocolate bar saying

295
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,589
"You can have this chocolate
bar, but you have to listen to

296
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,551
me first and do as I say."
>> So this is what I want from

297
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,679
you guys, I am going to find you
food, I'm good at this for some

298
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,888
reason.
I think it's because I grew up

299
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,557
around the ocean, but there are
two things that I just think

300
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,769
that we're not doing correctly.
The fire and that shelter is not

301
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,895
good.
Everybody was sleeping under

302
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,439
there, they were asleep, I
didn't have a place to sleep.

303
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,276
>> I'd be glad to move over as
far as you wanted to, you said

304
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,570
no, I don't need any more,
this is all I need.

305
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,405
>> All I want is a roof over my
head, and I want to feed you

306
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:23,036
because I want us to win.
>> Great job, Kath.

307
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,247
>> So this is what I'm saying,
we each have a role.

308
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,916
>> I think it's great that you
found where the food was, but I

309
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,085
don't think that any of us
should slip into one role.

310
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,296
>> I'm just saying that we don't
know each other's...

311
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,089
I don't even know what Paschal
does.

312
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,757
>> Well, Kathy, then, why don't
you talk to us?

313
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,552
Stop going off by yourself.
We're also trying to be a

314
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,263
society.
Why don't you know anything

315
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,431
about us?
>> I do know some.

316
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,101
I've been looking for food.
>> There's more going on here

317
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:48,270
than building a shelter and
getting food, there's a lot more

318
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,564
going on than making sure we
have water and making sure we

319
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,441
have fire.
>> All I want is a roof over my

320
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,276
head.
>> That's not all that I want.

321
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,111
I want to know you.
I'd rather get to know you

322
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,488
before I had a shelter.
>> You guys are all over me for

323
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,325
just asking for that.
>> I was totally taken off-guard

324
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,120
that they bit back so hard.
They bit back real hard.

325
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,414
To the point where I was almost
in tears.

326
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,625
>> What aspect of us being out
here worries you the most?

327
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,920
Having a shelter over your head?
Then I'll do my best to assuage

328
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,672
your worries.
This is an adventure, not just a

329
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,882
hardship.
>> Okay.

330
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,677
>> She kind of started to get
tears in her eyes, and I felt

331
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,512
bad.
Our point here isn't to make

332
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,098
anybody feel bad or hurt
anybody's feelings.

333
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:29,853
>> We decided it was past time
for a shelter, and it was a

334
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,315
priority for Kathy, so we made
it a priority for the group.

335
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,818
>> I have an idea, let's cut it
open.

336
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,197
>> It's nice to have something
we can all sleep under together

337
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,949
and not worry about the
elements.

338
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,826
>> All right, guys, this is a
very special moment.

339
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,495
>> Yes it is.
>> As my luxury item, I chose

340
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:51,041
the American flag because I'm
extremely patriotic.

341
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,002
>> This is cool.
>> It's just such a wonderful

342
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,338
symbol of what this group is
about.

343
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,340
Just makes me feel good to
look at it.

344
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,010
It really does.
>> Thank you so much.

345
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,387
>> No worries.
I did it for all of us.

346
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:12,980
>> I am at peace now.
>> The postman has arrived!

347
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,525
>> "You'll be left breathless if
it's depths you fear, so

348
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,861
remember, tread lightly for some
new fishing gear."

349
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:29,913
>> Ooh.
>> JEFF: Okay, today's

350
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:35,877
>> Ooh.
>> JEFF: Okay, today's

351
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,714
challenge is for a reward.
Here's how it works.

352
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,508
There are two boats sitting on
the bottom of the ocean floor

353
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,677
with about 250 rocks inside each
boat.

354
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,680
tubes,
one for each tribe.

355
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,100
Your challenge-- dive down,
start removing rocks until your

356
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,145
boat comes to the surface.
At that point, you bring it over

357
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,688
to the dock and start bailing
water.

358
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,899
Once you determine as a tribe
that your boat is seaworthy,

359
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,527
it's a race to the beach.
First tribe to get their boat

360
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,321
back to their mat wins reward.
Clear?

361
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,489
>> Clear.
>> JEFF: Want to know what

362
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,532
you're playing for?
>> Yeah!

363
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:10,078
>> JEFF: Mask, snorkel, fins.
Here it is.

364
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,913
(cheering)
>> JEFF: Since some of you

365
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,749
have already made spears, this
ought to make finding food a

366
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,417
little easier.
>> Yeah.

367
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,210
>> JEFF: Rotu, because you guys
have one extra member, you have

368
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,004
to sit somebody out.
Who's that going to be?

369
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,172
>> Rob.
>> Rob.

370
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,423
>> JEFF: All right, you'll stay
up at the beach with me.

371
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,384
Everybody else swim out to your
docks, wait for my go.

372
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:37,939
Survivors ready! Go!
>> This is going to take a long

373
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:54,456
Survivors ready! Go!
>> This is going to take a long

374
00:22:54,539 --> 00:23:03,590
time.
>> I took out three.

375
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:25,695
time.
>> I took out three.

376
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,324
Pull me over.
>> Gabe? Where's Gabe?

377
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,642
>> I got 19.
>> Come on, let's go, guys!

378
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,574
>> Okay, you guys, it's moving,
we can tip it.

379
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,700
We've got to give it a really
big push.

380
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,217
>> We did it!
(screaming, cheering)

381
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:42,272
>> Come on, let's go, guys!
>> Turn it around, turn it

382
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:50,906
>> Come on, let's go, guys!
>> Turn it around, turn it

383
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,908
around.
One, two, three, push!

384
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,077
>> Push. Turn it around!
Turn it around.

385
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:19,935
>> Get your foot out of the way.
>> JEFF: Rotu!

386
00:25:20,018 --> 00:26:01,768
>> Get your foot out of the way.
>> JEFF: Rotu!

387
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,479
(cheering)
>> JEFF: Rotu, congratulations.

388
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:40,265
>> It's going to rain.
>> It's going to rain.

389
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:48,481
>> Myself and Patricia and Sarah
have been working to get these

390
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:52,193
coconut fronds together so that
we can finish our roof.

391
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:58,199
My main thing was to try to get
it done before the rain, because

392
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,743
it's so unpredictable when it's
going to come and how long it's

393
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,829
going to be.
>> We'll get two beams and we'll

394
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,664
kind of a frame it a little.
>> What do you think?

395
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,541
>> Right about here and start
going up?

396
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,877
>> All right.
Whatever comes up to at least

397
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,713
cover this.
>> I've been saying for two days

398
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,841
that we need to put on the palm
fronds to make it waterproof

399
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,053
and for two days no one has been
listening to me and, all of a

400
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,889
sudden, Hunter just come up with
this great idea to do it and

401
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,392
everyone wants to do it.
>> Yeah, that one, perfect.

402
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,978
>> We have to go from the bottom
to the top, because the water

403
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:31,191
will drip down.
Guys?

404
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:35,570
>> I'm a little irritated at
Sarah today, she's making a lot

405
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,905
of comments, but it's all talk
and no action.

406
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,533
>> What's Hunter going to do on
the sides?

407
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,911
>> I don't know, ask him.
He's ignoring me for some

408
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,412
reason.
I've been trying to help for

409
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,749
like a half-hour.
>> They had already started and

410
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,750
she goes up and you know, "Well,
you need to put some here and

411
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,586
put some there.
I told ya'll that three days

412
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,296
ago."
She always tells you she's going

413
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,881
to do this, or we need to do
this, but she never does

414
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,841
anything on her own.
>> Does anybody agree with me?

415
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,260
>> What's that?
>> That if we put tons of the

416
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,056
palm fronds on front it's going
to make it waterproof,

417
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,600
crisscross them.
>> But I think we got to, like,

418
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,143
we need to fill in that big hole
first.

419
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,896
>> That's what I'm saying.
>> No, I mean with a woven

420
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,065
piece.
>> I don't know what the, I

421
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,942
mean, it looks pretty and all,
but it's just as waterproof if

422
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,737
we put tons up and down and tons
up this way.

423
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,781
>> We can, it's a lot of work
for us.

424
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,117
>> That's what I'm saying, we
should have worked on the one

425
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,619
side that needed it to most, now
we have two kind of waterproof

426
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:28,248
sides, instead of one really,
really good one.

427
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,000
Is no one in agreeance with
this?

428
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:39,426
I'm going to do it, I don't care
if you guys don't want to do it.

429
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,512
I want to be dry.
I'd like to have one place.

430
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:58,027
>> What do we got today?
>> Yeah!

431
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:02,657
>> Oh, my God, it's a fork.
>> Definitely eating something.

432
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,160
>> Well, at least we got some
utensils, man.

433
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,954
>> We got mail!
>> Woo!

434
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:11,499
"We're pleased to invite you to
this special repast.

435
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,836
We're making fafaru, with luck
you may last.

436
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,006
You might find it repulsive, but
please don't feel queasy, if the

437
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,092
result is explosive, the vote
may be easy."

438
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,928
>> A food challenge.
>> Yeah!

439
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,856
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.
Welcome to Atuatua Beach.

440
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:39,861
Today, we have a nice little
feast planned for you, a

441
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:44,032
Marquesan delicacy, reserved for
very special guests and

442
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,992
celebrations.
It's called fafaru.

443
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,996
Here's how it's made.
You take fish bones and crab

444
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,874
legs and lobster legs and you
make a marinade by letting it

445
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:57,378
rot in seawater for three days.
You then take the stinking

446
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,881
marinade and pour it over slices
of fish and let it stand in the

447
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,092
baking sun for a couple hours.
As you can tell, even from where

448
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,596
you're standing, this stuff
smells worse than a public

449
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,225
toilet on a hot summer day.
And just to make it fun, we're

450
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,853
going to bob for fafaru.
One at a time, you're going to

451
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,940
come up here, grab one of these
pieces of delicious fish with

452
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,442
your teeth, chew it up and
swallow it.

453
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,238
The tribe who gets down the most
pieces wins immunity.

454
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,949
Maraamu, because you guys are
one shy, whoever goes first

455
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,035
will also go last.
First member from each tribe

456
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,788
come on up.
Here we go.

457
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:41,047
Three, two, one, bob.
>> JEFF: Nicely done.

458
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,800
>> Man, that was good.
>> JEFF: Neleh and Mom.

459
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,261
>> Neleh!
>> Neleh!

460
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,766
>> JEFF: Neleh getting a lot
of the juice.

461
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:59,691
Wow, Mama didn't waste any time.
That's a juicy piece there.

462
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,818
>> Way to go, Neleh.
>> You're doing it, you're doing

463
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,153
it, you got it, you're doing it.
>> Keep your lip closed.

464
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:11,869
Keep your lip closed.
>> Yeah.

465
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:17,083
>> Yes!
>> JEFF: Next two.

466
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:27,010
(flies buzzing)
There you go, you're getting it.

467
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:33,641
Nice job, Paschal.
Ah, nicely done.

468
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,894
>> Yeah!
>> JEFF: Next two-- V. and K.

469
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:45,612
Bob.
You guys are good!

470
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:58,291
Three, two, one, bob.
>> Yeah, baby!

471
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:02,170
>> Good, Sean.
>> JEFF: Mind over matter.

472
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,341
Nice job.
>> Ah!

473
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,344
>> JEFF: Nice job, way to go,
guys.

474
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,180
Gina and Tammy, the women square
up.

475
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,977
>> Mama's biscuits.
>> Think of your biscuits, girl.

476
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,189
Think of your biscuits.
>> Yeah, Gina.

477
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:27,236
>> Yeah!
>> JEFF: Did good, nice job.

478
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,033
>> Go, Robby.
>> Go, Rob, tastes like pizza.

479
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,119
>> Pepperoni.
>> JEFF: Three, two, one.

480
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:45,880
>> Keep it down!
Rob!

481
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:49,884
>> You're doing it, Rob.
Keep it down.

482
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,056
>> JEFF: Good.
To your left, Rob.

483
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,392
>> Rob, don't taste it!
>> JEFF: Not on me.

484
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,354
>> Rob, swallow!
Swallow!

485
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,941
(choking)
>> You're tougher than that.

486
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,903
>> JEFF: You got five seconds
Rob, you got to get it down.

487
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:14,242
Five, four, three, two, swallow,
Rob.

488
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:18,496
Show me, there you go.
>> Yeah!

489
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,209
>> JEFF: Gabe, Hunter going
again.

490
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,504
>> Come on, Hunter.
>> Gabe, you know you love it.

491
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,555
>> JEFF: Right on, guys.
We have a tie.

492
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:39,392
Hats off to you guys.
This is some nasty smelling

493
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,061
stuff.
Nonetheless, immunity is at

494
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,064
stake.
Rotu, pick one member from

495
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,899
Maraamu.
>> We pick our brother from

496
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,109
Boston.
>> JEFF: Rob.

497
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,278
Guys, who you picking from Rotu?
>> The girl with the, um...

498
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,905
>> Me?
Neleh.

499
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,616
>> Neleh!
>> JEFF: First person to get

500
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,452
it down wins immunity for their
tribe.

501
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,454
Bob.
>> Go, baby.

502
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:04,041
>> Come on, Rob!
>> You're doing it, Rob.

503
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:17,930
>> Come on, Rob.
>> Carry us home, Rob.

504
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,600
>> You're so much tougher than
him!

505
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:27,315
>> You got it, Neleh!
(teams yelling)

506
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,901
>> The last piece?
>> That's it.

507
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:42,997
(screaming)
>> JEFF: Rotu, immunity!

508
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,462
Neleh gets to hold this.
Congratulations, Rotu,

509
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:54,634
immunity again.
>> JEFF: Not easy, man.

510
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,178
Unfortunately, Tribal Council.
See you guys there in a few

511
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,974
hours.
>> Over your head, woman.

512
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,352
(cheering)

513
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,367
>> Today, we had some pretty

514
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,205
stinky fish, and we had to
stick our face in it.

515
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,416
Pretty much everybody did their
job, and then it was my turn.

516
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,047
And I blew it for the team.
So we're going back to Tribal

517
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,216
Council pretty soon.
And everybody is pretty quiet,

518
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:48,729
keeping to themselves.
>> I'm talking to you on the

519
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,399
serious side.
Sarah, her or I are going next.

520
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,735
>> You're sure?
>> I feel 100% confident.

521
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,363
Hunter keeps telling Rob that
Sarah is not doing her share, so

522
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,741
she already knows she's the weak
link.

523
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,870
>> Sarah knows that she's just a
liability in this, you know,

524
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,039
she's just here for the ride,
then whoever wants to carry her

525
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,418
will carry her for as long as we
can go.

526
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,922
>> No doubt this one is killing
my home life.

527
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,133
>> That's what I don't
understand.

528
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,594
Why are you...
Why are you letting it?

529
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:24,098
Strategically?
>> If Sarah goes tonight, then

530
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:27,935
I'm going to need to make a
decision on if I'm going to join

531
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:32,190
Hunter and become the worker bee
again, or if I'm going to go

532
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,734
with Sean and risk looking
stupid.

533
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,570
I don't know, we maybe made a
mistake, Sean, because last

534
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,405
time, Mama was the one that
didn't contribute to the

535
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,325
challenge and we voted
Peter out.

536
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,161
>> See, but the thing is, you
pumped Mama up so much that now

537
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,914
she's doing too much talking.
>> I know I pumped her up, but

538
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,707
she got cocky and she's
confident now.

539
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,667
>> And loud.
I'm like, "Mama, chill!"

540
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,629
I'm voting my conscious.
I'm not going to get with you

541
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,632
and say let's vote somebody off.
I'm not even going to ask you

542
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,718
who you're voting for.
>> I don't know, man.

543
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,991
>> JEFF: Maraamu, back in
Tribal Council for a second

544
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,826
time.
Patricia, as somebody who's

545
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,329
raised kids of their own, you've
raised a family, you're the

546
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,331
self-proclaimed mom of this
group.

547
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,834
How are you guys doing?
>> I don't think we're 100%

548
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,711
productive.
I think we could do better and

549
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,380
that's coming from the mom side
of me.

550
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,674
>> JEFF: How is it, Rob,
having a mom?

551
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:44,345
>> Sometimes Mom's a pain in the
butt, but other times she's

552
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,348
there for you when you need her.
>> JEFF: How's that sit with

553
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,350
you, Sarah?
>> I think we're all adults and

554
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,187
nobody needs to be told what to
do, and no one needs to be

555
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,189
barked at.
I'm 24 years old, my mom hasn't

556
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,483
told me what to do in eight
years, so it's hard to take

557
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:02,697
sometimes, but you just kind of
bite your tongue and continue.

558
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,658
>> JEFF: Sean, do you guys
have a daily routine?

559
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,536
>> Yeah, we do.
I feel like I didn't leave work,

560
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,163
man.
Soon as we get up, we know

561
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,875
things need to be done, but it's
wearing my energy down, quite

562
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,168
frankly.
>> JEFF: Sarah?

563
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,754
>> I work 16 hour days when I'm
at home, I didn't come here to

564
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,256
do that.
>> JEFF: What did you come

565
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,882
here to do?
>> I came here to play the game

566
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,509
and meet cool people and have
this adventure.

567
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,802
I mean, we're definitely
working.

568
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,012
I will admit I do less of the
work.

569
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,889
I'm trying to save my energy.
I don't want to personally be

570
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,391
the one to lose a challenge
because I don't have enough

571
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,601
energy.
>> I totally disagree.

572
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,354
If I expend more energy to take
up for somebody who's not

573
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,232
working, then when I go to the
challenge, I'm going to be twice

574
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:41,027
as weak as I should be, because
I had to pull somebody else's

575
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,403
weight.
>> JEFF: So let's talk about

576
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,571
the challenges.
Hunter, sports analogy, you're

577
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,408
the captain, 0 for three cannot
set sit well with you.

578
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,244
>> We've been skunked so far.
We've had a couple tough breaks,

579
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,746
and we're still holding our head
high.

580
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,123
We'll come back and take it to
them, so...

581
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,917
>> JEFF: Rob, let talk about
the immunity challenge today.

582
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,755
>> I was very discouraged and I
feel like I let my team down in

583
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,300
a way, and this may be my night.
>> JEFF: Do you think it would

584
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,469
be fair to vote you out tonight?
>> If people want to vote me out

585
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,430
tonight, I could understand why,
yes.

586
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,225
>> JEFF: It's time to vote.
Patricia, you're first.

587
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,173
>> My vote tonight is for
Patricia.

588
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,968
She's a great person, but the
mom thing is getting pretty old

589
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,555
in the camp, so she's got to go.
I wish her the best of luck.

590
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:16,539
>> Sarah, I'm sorry, you know I
love you, but the beach party is

591
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,374
over.
We got to work hard, we got to

592
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,669
challenge hard and I just think
you're being a distraction.

593
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,845
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

594
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,941
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

595
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,526
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area

596
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,988
immediately.
I'll read the votes.

597
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:53,868
First vote...
Sarah.

598
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:04,128
Mama.
Sarah.

599
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:10,509
Patricia, Mom.
Two votes Sarah, two votes Mom.

600
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:20,227
Sarah.
Patricia.

601
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,730
We're tied, three votes Sarah,
three votes Mom.

602
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:27,401
Last vote.
Mom.

603
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:30,863
You need to bring me your torch,
Patricia.

604
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:48,339
Patricia, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

605
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,598
I've heard a lot tonight.
This is clearly a tribe divided.

606
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:02,353
You guys can head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.

607
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,240
Stay tuned for scenes from our
next episode.

608
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,747
>> JEFF: Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>
Tensions heat up at Maraamu.

609
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,457
>> Please don't be sensitive
about this.

610
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,417
>> Apparently, I have to be.
>> No, you don't.

611
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,629
>> Apparently, I have to be.
>> There's just too much drama

612
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,631
in this place!
>> JEFF: At Rotu, the love

613
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,342
tribe gets a lesson in pain.
>> Let me see, let me see, Rob.

614
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,802
>> Pain, you know, you got to
deal with it.

615
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,180
>> Things change just like that
out here.

616
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:46,939
>> I know why I got voted off
tonight.

617
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,276
I have no ill feelings.
I want y'all to come together as

618
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,819
a team and win these things and
come out on top.

619
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,197
I'm proud of each and every
other one of you.

620
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:59,159
And I made some wonderful
friendships and I hope they last

621
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,995
for a while.
I had a great time and I'd do it

622
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,663
again.
Love you!
