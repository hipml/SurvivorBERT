>> PROBST: On Raro...

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,558
>> Hey Adam, this is quite a bit

9
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,726
of work.

10
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,435
>> PROBST: ...priorities were

11
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,144
questioned.

12
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:19,769
>> Do you two want to a raised

platform?

14
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,896
>> I thought it sounded nice.

15
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,522
>> I know you do, but we have to

16
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,483
decide things as a group.

20
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,324

21
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,534

22
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,869
a bold plan to throw the

challenge and oust Billy.

24
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:38,496
>> Billy's just dead weight.

25
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,457
So we might as well cut our

26
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,875
losses now and get on with the

27
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:42,834
game.

29
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,669
but Cristina the cop was

30
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,920
skeptical.

31
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,671
>> I'm thinking, you know, this

32
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,714
doesn't seem right.

33
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,673
I don't know if I can trust

34
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,716

Puka's on the course, Raro's on

38
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,470
the course, Hiki's on the

39
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,304
course.

00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,805
...Ozzy's plan went into

41
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,598
action.

42
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,807
Aitu completely unconcerned

43
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,308
about this challenge.

44
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:03,271
Puka, Raro, Hiki, all safe from

45
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,023
tribal council.

46
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,733
Aitu came in dead last and

47
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,526
chose Yul from the Puka tribe to

48
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,236
go to Exile Island.

49
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,571
>> Yul, boat's waiting for you

50
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,572
now.

>> PROBST: Before the tribes

52
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,991
parted, Billy thought he and

53
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:20,497
Candice made a connection.

54
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,289
On Exile Island, Yul deciphered

55
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,750
the clues and found the hidden

56
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,251
immunity idol.

57
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,586
>> Oh, mama.

58
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,921
I found the immunity idol.

59
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:28,755
If there's an opportunity

60
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,006
where it can change the game,

61
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,299
I'd use it.

63

00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,512
secret.

65
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,138
>> I fell in love in this game,

66
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,223
love at first sight.

67
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,474
Her name is Candice.

68
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,892

>> Yeah, after the last

73
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,815
challenge, we sort of mouthed

74
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,774
the words "I love you" to one

75
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,650
another, and so that was my

76
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,400
prize.

77
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,610
My prize was her.

>> PROBST: In the end, Billy's

79
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,071
tribemates cut him loose.

80
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,490
Billy, the tribe has spoken.

81
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,368
18 are left.

82
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,327

possible.

94
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,462
Maybe he really had a crush on

her.

96
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,422
Maybe she was playing him

though.

They never had any kind of,

like, contact or communication.

104

just ridiculous.

you.

together as tribes divided based

210
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,563
on ethnicity.

211
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,606
It is now time to integrate.

213
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,655

I want you to reach in and grab

218
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,499

219
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,500
Don't look at it.

220
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,626
Keep it in your palm.

221
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,633
Different bag for the women.

222
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,391

00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,729
Reveal.

231
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,744

The men will choose men.

00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,395
paper, scissors to see who goes

284
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:04,770

00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,941
On my count, one, two, three.

00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,152
Scissor cuts paper.

Brad will pick first.

288
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:12,903
Brad, you're choosing a guy

not from your tribe.

294
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,625

>> PROBST: Yul, fresh from

296
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,212

00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:30,796
The two guys that have been to

298
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,923
exile.

299
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,008
That will be interesting,

300
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,259
comparing notes.

301
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,469
J.P., your choice, somebody not

302
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,636
yet represented.

not yet represented on your

308
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,732
tribe.

309
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,484

>> Nice to meet you.

317
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,757
>> Nice to meet you.

318
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,925
>> PROBST: Ozzy, your choice has

319
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,385
been made for you.

320
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,762
Cao Boi joins Yul, his old

321
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,597
tribemate, and Jonathan and

322
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,100
Ozzy.

323
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,394
We are now divided into four

324
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,853
tribes, separated by men and

325
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,064
women.

326
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,735
All four captains, step forward.

327
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,446
Take an egg.

328
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,825
Hold it in your palm, face up.

329
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,244
That's yours.

330
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:47,790
When I tell you to, I want you

331
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,334
to squish them with everything

332
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:50,751
you've got.

333
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,880
Three, two, one, squish!

334
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,928
There are two new tribes.

335
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,597
Men with blue, join the women

336
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,849
with blue.

337
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,809
Women with red, join the men

338
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,436
with red.

339
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,478
>> Come here, sisters.

340
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:09,937
Hello!

341
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,857
(<i> cheers</i> )

342
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,864
>> PROBST: Ozzy, here's your

343
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,865
new buffs.

344
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,116
You are the new Aitu tribe.

345
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,201
You will live on Aitutaki beach.

346
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,953
Brad, you are the new Raro

347
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,788
tribe.

348
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,123
You will live on Rarotonga

349
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,416
beach.

350
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,959
All of the items accumulated

351
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:32,918
will be pooled together and

352
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,588
divided evenly between the two

353
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,047
tribes.

354
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:37,840
Two new tribes, a whole new

355
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,967
game.

356
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,926
Head on out.

357
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,491
>> A welcoming home...

358
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,950
>> Feast? That sounds great.

359
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,869
>> We just moved up, girl.

360
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,872
(<i> laughter</i> )

361
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,750
>> This a blessing from life.

362
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,001
Today is the best day ever.

363
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:14,877
(<i> laughs</i> )

364
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,920
It's like they took us out of

365
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:16,545
the ghetto and took us to Bel

366
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,756
Air.

367
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,965
We have been so weak and

368
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,759
depleted, and today we got to

369
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,843
throw off those stanky, yellow

370
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,888
buffs, and now we're a new

371
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,014
tribe.

372
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,352
>> How did you all feel when

373
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,520
you first realized how your

374
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,103
tribe was going to be set up?

375
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,897
What was y'all's thoughts,

376
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,940
feelings about that?

377
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:36,857
How you were segregated?

378
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,900
>> I thought it was weird.

379
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,985
>> You know what?

380
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,320
I thought it was okay just for

381
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:41,987
the fact that whether it's

382
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,198
good or bad, it brings a

383
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,241
attention to it and makes people

384
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,116
think.

385
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,951
I just think that's a good

386
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:47,952
thing.

387
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,119
>> The way our tribe is blended

388
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,287
at this point, it's all about

389
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,705
people and who we are and what

390
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,082
we bring to the table.

391
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,833
You really don't see color.

392
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,210
You see the heart of that

393
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,711
individual and what they're

394
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,630
doing to make your tribe

395
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,048
stronger.

396
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,466
And that's what this is all

397
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,467
about.

398
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,426
>> Adam's a snorer.

399
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,886
>> I don't snore.

400
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,514
(<i> everyone talking at once</i> )

401
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,557
>> We're back to America.

402
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,474
We're a melting pot.

403
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,850
I love it.

404
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,935
Everyone's all mixed back

405
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,270
together, and I just think it's

406
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,229
great.

407
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,065
>> First and foremost, it's

408
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,108
going to be all smiles and

409
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,025
"Pleasure to meet you" and

410
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,277
"Glad you're here."

411
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,611
But in the back of your mind,

412
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,195
it's a game, and you're in it

413
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,364
to win it for yourself.

414
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:25,990
And first and foremost: cold,

415
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:26,991
hard cash.

416
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,118
>> One, two, three!

417
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,830
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )

418
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,164
>> I'm so excited.

419
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,084
>> Welcome, welcome, welcome,

420
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,128
welcome.

421
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,129
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )

422
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,046
You're home!

423
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,007
You're home!

424
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,383
Welcome.

425
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,551
>> First off, you guys did an

426
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,468
amazing job.

427
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,136
This is fantastic.

428
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,179
>> This is beautiful.

429
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,514
>> Is it watertight?

430
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,015
>> We have a wall.

431
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,559
Where's our wall?

432
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,019
Go back.

433
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,104
>> There's a wall in there.

434
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,355
>> We felt that Cecilia and

435
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,398
Ozzy were very welcoming.

436
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,149
They were just so excited.

437
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,359
Cecilia was the hostess.

438
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:02,985
She stood there and gave us the

439
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,446
spiel, point this out, point

440
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:05,988
that out, do that, do this,

441
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,990
this is what we got.

442
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,242
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

443
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,452
They're Hispanic--<i> mi casa es</i>

444
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,328
<i>su casa.</i>

445
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,287
That's beautiful.

446
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,206
We got our own little torch to

447
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,751
light up the whole place.

448
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,879
(<i> laughter</i> )

449
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,963
>> I'm definitely so happy

450
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,467
about the transition in this

451
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,217
game.

452
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,385
I definitely feel a change of

453
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,303
energy here.

454
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,012
I feel the vibration from other

455
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,432
people on my new tribe that I

456
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,726
didn't have the same in my old

457
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,352
tribe.

458
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,186
>> You're not Asian.

459
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,188
I love it.

460
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,356
I think you're fine, okay.

461
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,983
I think you're awesome.

462
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,735
>> I'm really excited about

463
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,361
just having fun people to hang

464
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,571
out with.

465
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,656
>> Okay, so I have to ask you

466
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,823
something.

467
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,575
Please don't be offended.

468
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,201
Billy, when he left-- and I'm

469
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,453
just curious-- Billy, when he

470
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,704
left, he said that you guys are,

471
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,873
like, love at first sight.

472
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,124
>> Love at first sight?

473
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,042
>> Yes.

474
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,168
And my jaw just dropped and I

475
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,086
was like...

476
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,128
>> You and Billy?

477
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,088
>> That is the weirdest thing I

478
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:04,380
ever heard.

479
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,090
So I got to ask you...

480
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,007
>> I mean, what did he mean by

481
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,634
that?

482
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,594
>> He said before the... we

483
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,178
left the last challenge, we

484
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,305
mouthed the words "I love you"

485
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,515
to each other.

486
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,141
>> No, he's...

487
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,226
>> Oh, no.

488
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,268
>> Were you saying good luck,

489
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,395
or...

490
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,437
>> No.

491
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,272
He said at the challenge or

492
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,774
whatever at the very end, he

493
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,275
just looked over to me and

494
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,110
Parvati, and he was like, "I'm

495
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,236
dead."

496
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,195
And I was like, "I'm sorry,

497
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,280
that really sucks" or whatever.

498
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,156
I was like, "We love you."

499
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,699
Like, our team, you know?

500
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,242
I didn't mean it like that.

501
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,327
>> He took it as you guys had a

502
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,037
love connection at first sight.

503
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,707
He said that that was his

504
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,208
million dollars, to get to be

505
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,960
with you.

506
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,294
Or like you know, know you,

507
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,713
like, be on the same team with

508
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,964
you.

509
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:47,548
>> You lead him on, Candice.

510
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,257
>> No, I did not.

511
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,050
(<i> laughter</i> )

512
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,135
>> You flirt, you.

513
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,177
>> You led him on.

514
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,304
>> Oh, please.

515
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,646
>> We've got to make a little

516
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,772
fire today.

517
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,360
Oh that's good.

518
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,611
Oh, that one's really good.

519
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,490
>> What are they doing?

520
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,241
>> I don't know, bonding.

521
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,326
(<i> laughter</i> )

522
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,953
>> We men.

523
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,495
>> There are so many men on

524
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,163
this tribe now.

525
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,205
It seems like we got all the

526
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,375
really big buff guys.

527
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,251
I'm absolutely going to flirt

528
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,086
with them.

529
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,504
Get them on my good side.

530
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,215
It's what I do best.

531
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,633
Aw, baby monkey.

532
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,720
>> Yeah, am I your baby monkey?

533
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,888
>> I already had Adam from the

534
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,431
beginning.

535
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,016
>> You have water in there?

536
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:39,641
>> I was drawn to Nate in the

537
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,602
first place just because he's

538
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,270
so, like, outgoing and funny and

539
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,355
kind of charming.

540
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,108
So I decided to work him, just

541
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,569
for starters.

542
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,653
Your pants are falling off,

543
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,821
Nate.

544
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,454
>> Lure him into my web, chomp

545
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,997
and suck his blood.

546
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,498
(<i> laughs</i> )

547
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,879
>> May have cooked these too

548
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,547
long, Cao Boi.

549
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,215
Cao Boi, how are you doing?

550
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,174
>> What?

551
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,842
>> I said how are you doing.

552
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,177
>> I'm doing fine, sir.

553
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,512
>> That's beautiful.

554
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,167
>> Cool.

555
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,463
>> I trust Yul, I trust Candice.

556
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,006
>> I totally agree.

557
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,549
No question that the four of

558
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,341
us should be...

559
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,385
>> Then we were thinking of

560
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,136
adding Flicka to make it five.

561
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,720
>> Believe me, I can get her

562
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,304
to do whatever we need her to

563
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,139
do.

564
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:01,557
>> Do you think...

565
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,391
>> I'll just say to her, "You,

566
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,476
me and Candice, we're going to

567
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,644
stay together and we're going

568
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,645
to deal with these other two

569
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,980
people, okay?"

570
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,189
>> I hear you.

571
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:09,773
>> I knew Becky was the person

572
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,567
I had to get to first.

573
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,609
But she was the key.

574
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,944
She came right to me.

575
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,404
She said, "Yul and I would like

576
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,280
to get together with you and

577
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:16,572
Candice."

578
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,197
I said, "Great."

579
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,991
I said, "I believe that I have

580
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,367
Flicka," hoping that she would

581
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,451
say "Okay, great."

582
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,127
>> I think we can align with a

583
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,253
couple of the Asians.

584
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,921
I think that's going to be able

585
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,172
to happen.

586
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:33,755
So we'll have a good, strong

587
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,883
five, I'm hoping.

588
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,009
All right?

589
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,468
But if anybody else approaches

590
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,553
you, just say, "Oh, yeah,

591
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,804
whatever," or "I'm not thinking

592
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,513
about it."

593
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,056
Just...

594
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,266
>> I'm not thinking about it.

595
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,101
I'm just sitting here.

596
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,978
>> I am thinking about it.

597
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,854
So you don't have to think about

598
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,063
it.

599
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,189
Let me think about it.

600
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,441
But I'm thinking about it.

601
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,734
Stay with me and Candice and

602
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,776
we'll take these other two and

603
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,444
the five of us will go to the

604
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,529
merge.

605
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,280
>> Jonathan wants me to stay in

606
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,158
the alliance from our original

607
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,242
tribe, in which I don't really

608
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,494
necessarily feel that

609
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,829
comfortable because I didn't

610
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,955
feel that comfortable in that

611
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,456
tribe to begin with.

612
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,041
>> We're strong.

613
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:09,499
We'll go all the way.

614
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,543
I mean, seriously, we'll make it

615
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,878
to the top five.

616
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,171
It's going to be cool, all

617
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:14,379
right?

618
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,548
>> All right.

619
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,758
I'm just kind of playing my

620
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,342
cards like I'm not really

621
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,427
thinking about alliances.

622
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,095
I'm just here to make friends

623
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:22,638
and see what happens and try

624
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,973
to, you know, go as long as I

625
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,434
can without feeling fake.

626
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,188
>> Candice and I, we were

627
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,940
talking and so she... her and

628
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:33,523
Jonathan basically were pretty

629
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,276
strong, too, and so, it's just,

630
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,527
you know, the perfect four.

631
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,154
But then we were trying to

632
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:39,696
figure out our fifth person.

633
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,573
So Jonathan mentioned Flicka,

634
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,575
and then we were deciding

635
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,993
between Ozzy and Cecilia.

636
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,371
So I don't know if her and Ozzy

637
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,664
already have an alliance or not

638
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,083
because they are two and they...

639
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,250
>> I'm sure that right now

640
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,627
they're kind of expanding a

641
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,962
little bit because they

642
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,046
realize that they're coming

643
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:56,672
into this with fewer numbers.

644
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,298
And so, I mean, if we went along

645
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,341
tribal lines, I mean, those

646
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,300
people would be voted out along

647
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,301
with Sundra.

648
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,054
I've to tell you something.

649
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:04,554
And again, you know, I'm

650
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,347
telling this because I totally

651
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,057
trust you.

652
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,141
>> Right, right.

653
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:08,684
>> This is sort of like my

654
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,686
gesture that, like, I trust

655
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,436
you and, like, all the stuff we

656
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,313
talked about, I really believe

657
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:13,522
in.

658
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,899
I found the idol.

659
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,317
>> That's so awesome.

660
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,485
>> Yeah.

661
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,945
>> First day or second day?

662
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:20,529
>> I found it... well, I found

663
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,321
it overnight just thinking

664
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,156
about the clues and kind of

665
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,532
working it out.

666
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,659
But you know, if we can somehow

667
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,743
turn the game around and get us

668
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,369
ahead, you know, you are in a

669
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,122
situation where I could save

670
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:30,706
your butt, I mean, I'll do it.

671
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,416
>> I appreciate it.

672
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,458
I trust you.

673
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,668
You know that I trust you.

674
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,961
>> Becky and I have, I think, a

675
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:36,545
tight bond and strong alliance

676
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,588
coming out of our Puka tribe.

677
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,923
You know, I think it's a huge

678
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:40,549
advantage in this game to have

679
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,467
somebody that you can absolutely

680
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,385
trust.

681
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,553
And I think, given our

682
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,721
backgrounds and our common

683
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,763
interests, I felt comfortable

684
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,597
disclosing the information to

685
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,724
her.

686
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,558
>> I am not going to tell

687
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:49,808
anybody.

688
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,143
I don't think you should tell

689
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:51,768
anybody again.

690
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,520
Oh, I'm so excited!

691
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,896
I'm so proud of you.

692
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,605
That's so awesome.

693
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,720
>> Oh, my God!

694
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,429
>> He has a what?

695
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,097
>> Octopus.

696
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,480
>> I felt like the man!

697
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,316
I was, "What, octopus, what do

698
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:39,649
you got now?"

699
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,693
It's a good feeling.

700
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,654
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

701
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,573
>> Pull it back.

702
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,743
Strong.

703
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,079
>> Look at him sucking me.

704
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:52,496
>> I told you.

705
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,582
(<i> laughter</i> )

706
00:22:55,665 --> 00:23:00,253
>> He is going home!

707
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,421
>> Pull that head back.

708
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,799
>> Ha, ha.

709
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,384
>> Yeah, Nate.

710
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,426
>> How did you find him?

711
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,511
>> I don't think the guys or

712
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,553
anyone really expected me to do

713
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,055
it, to come back with

714
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,098
something, and something so

715
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,015
heavy.

716
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,183
Looking at it, you know, just

717
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:13,767
hanging, I was like, "Yeah,

718
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,561
we're eating this fool tonight."

719
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,646
>> We got dinner, ladies.

720
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,606
>> It's huge.

721
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,941
>> How did you get that?

722
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,109
>> I had a spear, and I

723
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,068
couldn't let go of the spear

724
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:23,902
because he would swim off with

725
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,444
it.

726
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:24,778
He was strong.

727
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,531
>> That is a lot of meat.

728
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,032
You need it.

729
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:29,908
You could probably eat that

730
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,368
whole thing yourself.

731
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,744
>> Probably.

732
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,106
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

733
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,149
to today's immunity challenge?

734
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,525
>> Yeah.

735
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,985
>> PROBST: All right, for

736
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,194
today's challenge, each tribe

737
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,487
will begin clipped together by a

738
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,614
rope.

739
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,740
In addition, each of you will

740
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,118
be carrying a 15-pound sandbag

741
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,327
on your back.

742
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,495
You will start on opposite

743
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,205
sides of the course.

744
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,582
On my go, you will race through

745
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,709
knee-deep water attempting to

746
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,628
catch the other tribe.

747
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,380
When you get tired, and some of

748
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:25,964
you will, it's okay to opt out

749
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,591
of the challenge.

750
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,717
But first, you have to take

751
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,676
your 15 pounds and give it to

752
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,137
another tribe member who is now

753
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,598
carrying twice as much weight.

754
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,640
First tribe to catch the other

755
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,435
tribe and tackle one of their

756
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,562
tribe members to the ground

757
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,689
wins immunity, is safe at least

758
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,565
one more day here in the Cook

759
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,650
Islands.

760
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,069
Losers, tribal council tonight,

761
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:48,737
somebody going home.

762
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,947
There is one more element to

763
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:51,990
this challenge.

764
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,033
The details are in the note.

765
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,409
It'll be revealed after the

766
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,952
challenge is over.

767
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,245
Make sense?

768
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,455
>> Yeah.

769
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,080
>> PROBST: Get suited up, we'll

770
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,040
go.

771
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,126
Here we go, for immunity.

772
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,169
Survivors, ready!

773
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,297
Go!

774
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,639
This is an endurance challenge.

775
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,682
It is going to wear you out.

776
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,519
Water is almost knee-deep on

777
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,396
everybody.

778
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,775
Hard to walk through.

779
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,443
Both tribes have big guys at

780
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,028
the end.

781
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,947
Try to prevent easy tackles.

782
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,410
Both tribes have strong guys at

783
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,913
the front to make the tackles.

784
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,708
Aitu made up just a little

785
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,627
ground on that round.

786
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,171
Cecilia drops out, Sundra drops

787
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,050
out, Candice drops out, Becky

788
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:52,676
dropping out.

789
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,595
Aitu now down to five members.

790
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,763
Bold strategy move for Aitu.

791
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,015
All of their men now with 30

792
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,850
pounds.

793
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,686
Stephannie dropping out for

794
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,854
Raro.

795
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,654
>> PROBST: Cristina dropping out

796
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,823
for Raro.

797
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,199
Adam takes her weight.

798
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,201
Jenny dropping out for Raro.

799
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,495
Aitu still with a bit of a lead.

800
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,122
Jessica dropping out.

801
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:22,747
She's giving her weight to

802
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,832
Jonathan.

803
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,875
He's got three bags now, 45

804
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,628
pounds of sand.

805
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,755
Parvati dropping out for Raro.

806
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,508
Rebecca, the only woman left in

807
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,634
this challenge.

808
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,178
Aitu is down to four guys--

809
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,890
Ozzy, Jonathan, Cao Boi and Yul

810
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,560
shouldering a lot of weight.

811
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,648
Jonathan going to give 15

812
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,109
pounds to Ozzy.

813
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,069
Raro making up a lot of time,

814
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,573
starting to close in on Aitu.

815
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,450
Aitu has no options left.

816
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,952
Jonathan can hardly walk.

817
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,454
Cao Boi needs to be helped by

818
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,539
Yul.

819
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,166
Rebecca finally dropping out, a

820
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,293
key player in helping Raro get

821
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:08,710
a lead.

822
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,004
We are now even, four members

823
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:11,796
each.

824
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,135
J.P., Nate, Brad, Adam closing

825
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,513
the gap with each step.

826
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,686
>> Give it all you got.

827
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,272
Go, go!

828
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,398
>> PROBST: Raro making a go of

829
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,942
it.

830
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:40,283
J.P., Nate, Adam, Brad.

831
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,242
Yul going to try to fight them

832
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,869
off as long as he can.

833
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,914
But Cao Boi's too weak.

834
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,957
This challenge is over!

835
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,876
Raro wins immunity!

836
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,002
(<i> cheers</i> )

837
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,720
Raro, congratulations.

838
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,057
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )

839
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:06,184
Safe from the vote, guaranteed

840
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,311
at least one more day out here.

841
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,646
There is one more element to

842
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,021
this challenge.

843
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,440
I'll read the note.

844
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,651
"The winning tribe will choose

845
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,237
one member from the losing

846
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,990
tribe to go to Exile Island,"

847
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,368
which means the person you

848
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,829
choose to send to Exile Island

849
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,455
will miss tribal council

850
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,706
tonight.

851
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,749
You are keeping somebody in

852
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,000
this game.

853
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,252
A lot of ways to play this

854
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,753
strategically.

855
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,754
Figure out who it is going to

856
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,464
be.

857
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,632
Do you have your decision?

858
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,467
>> Candice.

859
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,844
>> PROBST: It was unanimous.

860
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,346
Candice, boat will pick you up,

861
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,806
have your stuff for you.

862
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,224
Head on out.

863
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,395
Okay, Raro, you guys are safe

864
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,604
from the vote.

865
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,523
Everybody's good.

866
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,149
Aitu, we have a date tonight at

867
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,900
tribal council.

868
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,943
One of the eight of you will be

869
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,194
going home.

870
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,154
You have the afternoon to

871
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,113
figure out who that's going to

872
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:00,822
be.

873
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,574
Head on back to camp.

874
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,432
>> Can we just take one second

875
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,600
and think of why they picked

876
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,392
Candice?

877
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,560
>> I don't think they would

878
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,519
perceive her as being the

879
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,687
strongest physically, so I

880
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,688
think they're just protecting

881
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:34,772
her.

882
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,857
>> They're trying to protect

883
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,900
her from us voting her off?

884
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,027
>> Candice went to Exile Island.

885
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,862
It has a huge effect on our

886
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,863
plans.

887
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,198
Prior to this, we had an

888
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,657
alliance going on between

889
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,201
myself, Jonathan, Becky,

890
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,328
Candice, and we were pretty

891
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,662
confident that with the four of

892
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,039
us pulling in one other person

893
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,081
we would have a numbers

894
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,374
advantage.

895
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,292
But now it doesn't look to be

896
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,335
the case.

897
00:29:58,796 --> 00:29:59,047
And actually...

898
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,964
>> I need you guys, too.

899
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:00,882
We all need each other.

900
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,176
We just need to win.

901
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,552
>> But we have to obviously

902
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,011
write down some...

903
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,430
>> We have to let Becky go.

904
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:07,847
>> Okay.

905
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,766
>> I think Becky is the weak

906
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:10,975
link.

907
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,063
>> All right.

908
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,814
>> Cao Boi said alliance with

909
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,816
us, he said we're good, the

910
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,610
girls are good.

911
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,028
He said he really liked you,

912
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,321
you know, everybody...

913
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,281
We got all (<i> inaudible</i> ).

914
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,741
I say we get rid of Becky.

915
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:30,078
Becky is seriously plotting.

916
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,206
>> All we need is five.

917
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,624
We are all voting for Becky.

918
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,292
Cao Boi, myself, Cecilia,

919
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,794
Sundra and Flicka seem to have

920
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,964
some sort of an agreement, and

921
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,799
we'll see if it stands.

922
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,772
>> Jonathan, what are you doing?

923
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,107
>> Let's...

924
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,108
Come here.

925
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,109
Let's...

926
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,193
I'll check in with you.

927
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,365
>> No more talking.

928
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,199
We're done.

929
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,052
>> I thought I had Flicka

930
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,221
handled.

931
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,766
I thought she was with me.

932
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,767
But she's not.

933
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,977
She's doing her own thing, and

934
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,645
I don't know how easy or hard

935
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,688
it's going to be to convince

936
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,814
her otherwise.

937
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:40,815
So we've got a serious problem

938
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,150
here.

939
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,651
Where do we stand right now?

940
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,361
It's you, me, Becky and that's

941
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,237
it.

942
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:46,821
We don't know where Sundra's

943
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:47,905
at.

944
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,531
We don't know where Cao Boi's

945
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,407
at.

946
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,491
And Flicka is going to be

947
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,743
probably impossible to switch.

948
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,827
>> Really?

949
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,620
>> We're good, right, from what

950
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,537
we said.

951
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,371
>> Yeah, yeah, we need to stick

952
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,706
with it.

953
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,832
But Jonathan is just worried

954
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,584
because I'm not for sure saying

955
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,084
that I'm a part of their

956
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,085
alliance because I don't want

957
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,171
to be wishy washy.

958
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,380
>> You're just going to follow

959
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,673
your gut.

960
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,591
>> We just have to make it

961
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,592
through tonight.

962
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,635
We've got to get Flicka or Cao

963
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,844
Boi to vote for Cecilia.

964
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:10,970
And it's risky because if we

965
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,305
don't know that they are rock

966
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,556
solid going to vote our way,

967
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,600
then you and I put our necks way

968
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,185
out on the line.

969
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,314
Trying to convince Flicka and

970
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,148
Cao Boi to vote with us is the

971
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,025
key.

972
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,819
If not, then all bets are off

973
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,904
and it's going to be a whole

974
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,656
different kettle of fish.

975
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,782
All I'm concerned about is

976
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,200
making it to the merger.

977
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,118
Everybody you like is going to

978
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,329
get voted off.

979
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,372
>> I know, it's not about that,

980
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,414
though.

981
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,457
It's about having trust in the

982
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,084
people that you have a

983
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,293
connection with.

984
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,378
>> Okay, so I thought you and I

985
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,545
had a tight thing.

986
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,588
So we don't have such a tight

987
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,339
thing.

988
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,465
Do we not trust each other?

989
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,341
We're talking like adults.

990
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,592
>> I'm sorry.

991
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,551
We have to let Becky go in

992
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,469
total fairness.

993
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,303
She's the weak link.

994
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,388
Then we'll lose another one.

995
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,138
>> She's not a weak link.

996
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,098
>> She is.

997
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,057
She a princess out here.

998
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,432
You pay attention.

999
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,101
She's a princess out here.

1000
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,394
I just watch and I just...

1001
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,436
>> But she's not... she's not,

1002
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,312
like, weak.

1003
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,605
She's strong.

1004
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,564
I think she has been very

1005
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,565
strong and decisive on the

1006
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,483
challenges.

1007
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,984
I think if you look at Cecilia,

1008
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,194
she hasn't been that strong.

1009
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,237
She's good at puzzles, but

1010
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,279
physically she hasn't been that

1011
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,489
strong.

1012
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,657
>> If five of us vote for

1013
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,867
Cecilia tonight, okay, and three

1014
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,953
of you vote for Becky, then all

1015
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,037
of a sudden you're on the

1016
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,873
outside and, boom, you're gone.

1017
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,166
>> If we get rid of Cecilia,

1018
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,209
we'll have our numbers, okay?

1019
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,545
We can decide later on whether

1020
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,046
we need to draw Becky, you,

1021
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,091
Jonathan, Flicka.

1022
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:30,425
That's five.

1023
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,343
That's a solid five.

1024
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,720
>> That's still not the point,

1025
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,595
though.

1026
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,680
>> Well, what is the point?

1027
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,264
I guess we're talking apples

1028
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:36,556
and oranges.

1029
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,182
>> Yeah, we kind of are,

1030
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,393
because I'm just thinking she's

1031
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,602
the weaker link and I'm not

1032
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,186
there.

1033
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,813
>> I'm trying to think ahead of

1034
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,647
that.

1035
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,606
>> I'm not thinking ahead.

1036
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,399
I'm not...

1037
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,191
>> But this is a game.

1038
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,234
This is like a chess game.

1039
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,235
>> Yeah, right.

1040
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,361
>> This is a 30 day...

1041
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,404
we have 30 more days ahead of

1042
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,155
us.

1043
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:52,697
You can't just think about

1044
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,990
tomorrow.

1045
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:54,824
You have to put yourself in a

1046
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,450
position that you can be there

1047
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,159
in 30 days.

1048
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:56,743
You have to think about that

1049
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,952
now.

1050
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:58,828
>> Uh-huh.

1051
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,746
>> I mean, because otherwise

1052
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,747
you won't be there.

1053
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,457
>> Uh-huh.

1054
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,794
Hmm.

1055
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,795
I don't know.

1056
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,214
I have to think about it still.

1057
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,799
>> We've got to stick tight.

1058
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,383
>> You present your point and,

1059
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,218
okay, I'll listen to you.

1060
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,178
>> I don't like the scheming of

1061
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,304
man.

1062
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,848
I really don't like that at all.

1063
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,141
I feel like I've always been

1064
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,184
blessed.

1065
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,145
Maybe this time I'm wrong.

1066
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:24,729
>> No matter what they said, I

1067
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,105
said, "I'm going to talk to

1068
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,315
Jessica first."

1069
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,357
Okay.

1070
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,067
>> I have a hard time

1071
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,400
trusting...

1072
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,610
>> I don't trust Jonathan.

1073
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,069
>> I don't trust Jonathan.

1074
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,321
>> He's manipulative.

1075
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,990
>> I had a good talk with her.

1076
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,200
She doesn't like the idea of

1077
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,035
playing the game that way.

1078
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,119
>> But Jonathan has a point, the

1079
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,329
numbers game.

1080
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,330
We have to make it to the

1081
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,372
merger.

1082
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,373
We can play the game some more.

1083
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,416
>> I don't want to be picked

1084
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,292
off.

1085
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,126
>> I know, but they are playing

1086
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,252
bad.

1087
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,212
You are not part of the crowd.

1088
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:49,754
I'm not part of the crowd,

1089
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:50,797
period.

1090
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,965
We're just stuck in this...

1091
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,133
>> Now what do you do?

1092
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,343
I don't know what to do.

1093
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,552
I'm getting all wrapped up in

1094
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,929
this whole drama.

1095
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,513
I realize it's a numbers game,

1096
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,058
but I have a lot of respect for

1097
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,893
Ceci, so I don't know.

1098
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,896
It's so hard.

1099
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,773
I'm like, ahh!

1100
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,359
>> Two ways to play the game:

1101
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,152
"I like you, so I'm not going

1102
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,278
to vote for you," or "Sorry, I

1103
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,781
like you, but I got to vote for

1104
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,324
you because I want to go

1105
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:18,574
further."

1106
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,159
We have two different

1107
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,619
philosophies, and it's a war.

1108
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,538
I don't know.

1109
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,455
We'll see how convincing I've

1110
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,623
been.

1111
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,930
>> PROBST: Go ahead and have a

1112
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,974
seat.

1113
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,519
So let's talk about the merge.

1114
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,229
Jonathan, in this case, the

1115
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,856
tribes have been divided based

1116
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,107
on ethnicity.

1117
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,275
Did that add anything to the

1118
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,609
merge?

1119
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,527
>> I didn't think so.

1120
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,736
Honestly, I didn't.

1121
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,320
I think the captains selected

1122
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,155
the strongest people they could

1123
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,365
given the parameters.

1124
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,616
We had a sense of who was

1125
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,034
strong and I'm actually really

1126
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:02,618
pleased with the way the merge

1127
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,328
went.

1128
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,454
>> PROBST: Sundra, as the only

1129
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,831
person from one tribe, you

1130
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,415
suddenly can become extremely

1131
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,417
powerful as everybody now wants

1132
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,170
your vote because you have no

1133
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,546
allegiance to anyone.

1134
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,922
>> Yeah, I mean, you could say

1135
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,299
you are either vulnerable or

1136
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,175
valuable, and I don't give

1137
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,552
credit to either.

1138
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,761
I just try to be there and

1139
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,346
just use my gut to say, "Okay,

1140
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,431
this is what I should do,"

1141
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,599
because, as you know, there's

1142
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,224
no way to guarantee the results

1143
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,227
of playing this game.

1144
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,353
>> PROBST: Yul, assess this

1145
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,479
tribe.

1146
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,689
What do you think would be the

1147
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,732
best direction for this tribe

1148
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,816
to head?

1149
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,318
>> My sense is that some people

1150
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,527
have different priorities in

1151
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,737
terms of what they are looking

1152
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,155
for out of being here.

1153
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,239
I think some people are

1154
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,365
strategizing and trying to make

1155
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,533
alliances and came here to play

1156
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,951
hard to win the game.

1157
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,411
I think other people came here,

1158
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,621
you know, hoping that this

1159
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,914
is going to be a personally

1160
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:48,831
fulfilling experience for

1161
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,248
everyone.

1162
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,375
>> PROBST: And Jonathan,

1163
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,793
nothing wrong or right about

1164
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,836
either one of those ends of the

1165
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,171
continuum.

1166
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,130
>> Absolutely.

1167
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,882
Someone who's here to just

1168
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:58,466
have the experience and not

1169
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,301
play the game, they're going to

1170
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,969
be playing the game.

1171
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,179
The game is happening with them

1172
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:03,930
in it.

1173
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,014
And people who are here who are

1174
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:05,890
strategizing, they're also

1175
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,974
dealing with the personalities

1176
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:07,892
here and they're really in the

1177
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:08,935
experience.

1178
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:09,852
And that's what makes it

1179
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,811
interesting is that none of us

1180
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,771
are thinking about it exactly

1181
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,521
the same way.

1182
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,356
Otherwise, it would be pretty

1183
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:13,731
boring, I think.

1184
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,441
>> PROBST: So Jessica, eight

1185
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,609
days in, is this game already

1186
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,652
more complicated than you

1187
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,612
anticipated?

1188
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,321
>> I think that I'm just not

1189
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,991
used to the manipulation aspect

1190
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,576
of it, and just where people's

1191
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,285
intentions are gets really

1192
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,746
confusing to me.

1193
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,914
Like, are you really telling me

1194
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:30,498
because you're being nice or

1195
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,667
are you telling me this because

1196
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,542
you're, like, trying to get me

1197
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,835
on your side so you could,

1198
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,087
like, get me to, like, vote

1199
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,296
somebody off who I like, you

1200
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,506
know?

1201
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,507
It's just weird, because I'm

1202
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,717
not ready to lose one of our

1203
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,344
members of our tribe yet.

1204
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,595
>> PROBST: Ozzy, how is this

1205
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,513
tribe going to be different

1206
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,307
after tonight's vote?

1207
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,726
>> Well, I'm going to...

1208
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,103
after tonight's vote, I'm going

1209
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:52,687
to know where people actually

1210
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,730
stand as to what they were

1211
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,940
saying before.

1212
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,484
So that's pretty much how it's

1213
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,028
going to go.

1214
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:01,654
>> PROBST: Before we get to the

1215
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,406
vote, two of you have been to

1216
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,615
Exile Island.

1217
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,908
The hidden immunity idol might

1218
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,243
have been found.

1219
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:07,827
Just to be clear, here's how

1220
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,246
it works: if the person in

1221
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,622
possession of the idol receives

1222
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,374
the highest number of votes,

1223
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,834
you present that idol to me

1224
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,085
after the vote, you're back in

1225
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,211
the game.

1226
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,337
And the person with the next

1227
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,547
highest number of votes goes

1228
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,548
home.

1229
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,590
It is time to vote.

1230
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,509
Yul, you're up.

1231
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,728
>> Cecilia, I'm really sorry to

1232
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,353
be sending you home.

1233
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,564
And the vote was either going to

1234
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,523
go against Becky or yourself.

1235
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,151
And between the two, my loyalty

1236
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:40,443
is to Becky.

1237
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,987
Best of luck to you.

1238
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,825
>> It's nothing personal.

1239
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,659
I think you're amazing.

1240
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,660
It's what I think will be

1241
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,954
better for the tribe.

1242
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,504
>> It's nothing personal, girl.

1243
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,757
I'm just doing this as far as

1244
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,924
strategy for moving the tribe

1245
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,718
forward in this game.

1246
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,598
>> You haven't made any effort

1247
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,933
to try and connect to me, get

1248
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,436
to know me at all.

1249
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,620
>> You're a very classy lady.

1250
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,289
This is nothing personal.

1251
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,416
It's just strategy.

1252
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,144
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1253
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,604
votes.

1254
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,074
Once the votes are read, the

1255
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,200
decision is final.

1256
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,243
The person voted out will be

1257
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,244
asked to leave the tribal

1258
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,245
council area immediately.

1259
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,081
I'll read the votes.

1260
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,459
First vote, Cecilia.

1261
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,587
Becky.

1262
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,630
One vote Cecilia; one vote

1263
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,841
Becky.

1264
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:29,677
Two votes Becky; one vote

1265
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,515
Cecilia.

1266
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,892
Cecilia.

1267
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:37,977
That's two votes Cecilia;

1268
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,604
two votes Becky.

1269
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,605
Cecilia.

1270
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,191
We're three votes Cecilia; two

1271
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:44,900
votes Becky.

1272
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,697
Becky.

1273
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,614
We're tied.

1274
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,116
Three votes Becky; three

1275
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:52,575
votes Cecilia.

1276
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,166
Cecilia.

1277
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:00,708
Four votes Cecilia; three

1278
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,585
votes Becky.

1279
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,336
One vote left.

1280
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,261
Third person voted out of

00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,512
Cecilia.

1283
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,973
Please bring me your torch.

1284
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,029
Cecilia, the tribe has spoken.

1285
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,084
Well, one thing is clear, this

1286
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,338
tribe is definitely not unified.

1287
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,298
And only eight days in to a game

1288
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,175
this unpredictable, certainly

1289
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,301
risky.

1290
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,135
Grab your torches.

1291
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,053
Go back to camp.

1292
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:54,762
Good night.

1293
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,026

insane.

never thought I would ever do

1323
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,442
and probably won't ever do

1324
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,443
again.

1325
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,403
I think that they made a mistake

1326
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,320
voting me out.

1327
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,363
I don't think this is going to

1328
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,072
strengthen them.

1329
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,448
It may weaken the tribe,

1330
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,491
unfortunately.
