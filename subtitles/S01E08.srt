00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,713
JEFF PROBST:
<i>16 Americans,</i>
<i>marooned for 39 days</i>

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,215
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China Sea.</i>

3
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,927
<i>Separated into two tribes--</i>
<i>Tagi and Pagong--</i>

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,304
<i>they competed against each</i>
<i>other to remain on the island,</i>

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,140
<i>but now the tribes</i>
<i>have merged into one.</i>

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>Rattana is the name,</i>

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,770
<i>and it is everyone</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,105
<i>Every third night,</i>

9
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,149
<i>the entire tribe will hike</i>
<i>deep into the jungle</i>

10
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,151
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the Tribal Council,</i>

11
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,360
<i>where they must vote</i>
<i>one of their own</i>

12
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>off the island.</i>

13
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,906
<i>In the end, one will remain</i>

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,201
<i>and will leave the island</i>
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,459
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor:

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,586
<i>The stakes were raised</i>
<i>for the castaways</i>

17
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>as the two tribes</i>
<i>merged into one.</i>

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,216
GREG:
<i>There was a lot of baggage</i>
<i>that we left</i>

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,010
on that Pagong beach.

20
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,803
JEFF:
<i>The members of Pagong</i>
<i>were upbeat</i>

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>as they paddled to their</i>
<i>new home at Tagi beach.</i>

22
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,892
I'm excited to go to their camp
and meet new people.

23
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,644
Rich came out and was, like,
"Hey, how are you?"

24
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,313
You know, he swam out,
which was really nice.

25
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,482
They welcomed us with open arms.

26
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,816
JEFF:
<i>But the Tagi alliance</i>

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,859
<i>was a wolf in sheep's clothing.</i>

28
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,487
I don't need to
deal with that.
After Gretch?

29
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,863
Jenna.

30
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,823
I was thinking Sean.

31
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,158
JEFF:
<i>Rudy wasn't happy</i>
<i>with the new Rattana Tribe.</i>

32
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,537
RUDY:
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>we doubled our population.</i>

33
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,830
Personally,
it's a pain in the ass.

34
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,414
JEFF:
<i>Greg won the first</i>

35
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>immunity talisman,</i>

36
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,836
<i>ensuring that only he could not</i>
<i>be voted off at Tribal Council.</i>

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,881
<i>Sean began</i>
<i>his alphabet voting strategy</i>

38
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,842
<i>and to the surprise of many,</i>
<i>it was Gretchen who was ousted.</i>

39
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,177
Oh, my God.

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,386
It's me.

41
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,347
JEFF:
<i>Nine members of Rattana</i>
<i>are left.</i>

42
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,975
<i>Tonight, one more will go.</i>

43
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,299
SEAN:
<i>Today is, like, Day 22.</i>

44
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,843
We had a vote last night,
which is always pretty beat.

45
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,012
Always puts us
in a pretty somber mood.

46
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,222
But last night was
a very strange vote.

47
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,267
Last night, it looks
like there was a conspiracy,

48
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,771
and maybe I'm being paranoid
and I didn't want to believe it,

49
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,609
but four people from Tagi
voted for Gretchen, I think.

50
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,612
SEAN:
<i>You know, the bloodbath</i>
<i>has begun, you know.</i>

51
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,281
People have started taking it
a different way,

52
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,325
'cause there's really no good
reason other than strategy

53
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,744
to vote Gretchen off.

54
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,958
GREG:
Gretchen distinctly disliked
this part of the game.

55
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,501
This was her hardest thing

56
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,211
was voting people off,

57
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,463
and the part
that she liked the most

58
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,298
was the survival aspect.

59
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,343
GERVASE:
<i>I really don't know</i>
<i>what happened last night.</i>

60
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,386
At first sight, it looks like
they just picked Gretchen off.

61
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,140
SEAN:
I think that
my former team, Tagi,

62
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:48,311
probably formed an alliance
against what they perceived

63
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,521
as her... as their
strongest member of Pagong,

64
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,149
which was Gretchen.

65
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,112
It was my idea to get rid
of Gretchen because I...

66
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,324
I thought that she was going
to be the next leader.

67
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,368
She had to go because she...

68
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:08,498
is bright and, uh, is strong
and she was a threat.

69
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,293
SEAN:
<i>The, uh, duplicity of the whole</i>
<i>thing is pretty bad,</i>

70
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,336
because I think that people
went out of their way

71
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,005
to befriend her, and, uh...

72
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,676
and those were the people who
subsequently voted against her.

73
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,511
GREG:
That's the game--
duplicitous, sleaziness--

74
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,346
if you want to play that way.

75
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,430
KELLY:
<i>This is a game;</i>
<i>don't take it personally.</i>

76
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,517
You know, if people came here
to make, you know,

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,144
bosom buddies
and, you know, lifelong friends,

78
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,021
they should've gone
to summer camp.

79
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,025
GERVASE:
<i>I think, really,</i>
<i>if it happens again,</i>

80
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,986
then you can say for sure
there's an alliance,

81
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,196
but if it does,
I'm more determined than ever

82
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,994
to bust that plan up and still
kill them all and win, you know.

83
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,370
As far as Pagong,
we are now four.

84
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,080
They are now five.

85
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,041
They do have a voting bloc
on us whether we see it or not

86
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,918
and they can pick us off
one by one.

87
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,045
Who needs men?

88
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,549
<i>My best strategy</i>
<i>is to bond with the women</i>

89
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:04,053
and try to hold on to the
women's vote as long as I can.

90
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,015
I'm so excited, guys.

91
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,558
I don't care if you
vote me off now

92
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,226
'cause I made it
to my cutoff point.

93
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,103
The girls... no,
there ain't no girls

94
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,855
going for a while,
you guys.

95
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,066
Thanks, Sue.
That makes me
feel better.

96
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,860
SUSAN:
<i>The women seem</i>
<i>to be getting along well</i>

97
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,153
<i>because the women</i>
<i>are all workers.</i>

98
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,072
<i>Actually, I like Jenna better</i>
<i>than I thought I would.</i>

99
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,075
I thought she would drive me
wild and she doesn't, so...

100
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,410
Don't worry.

101
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,536
The guys' days
are numbered.

102
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,913
They are numbered.

103
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,250
Us girls... us girls are
here for a while, trust me.

104
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,251
Oh, man, I love it.

105
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,421
We'll be up at the end.

106
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,590
I do see the women versus men
vote continuing on in Rattana.

107
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,093
As far as my three votes, top--
they're all men.

108
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,391
Oh, God, you guys,
look at these crabs.

109
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,269
<i>I see women go out,</i>
<i>get the crab traps.</i>

110
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,604
<i>The women fix the hut.</i>

111
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,439
<i>We're carrying the weight</i>
<i>of the team.</i>

112
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,816
<i>Maybe that's unfair,</i>
<i>but that's how I see it.</i>

113
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,401
Ooh, look at it.

114
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,612
(<i> women screaming</i> )

115
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,448
Get him...
get him, Sue.

116
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,117
Beat him
with the shoe.

117
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,035
(<i> women laughing</i> )

118
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,828
She had me beat the
hell out of a crab

119
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,497
with a shoe.

120
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,458
SUSAN:
<i>As far as the women</i>
<i>becoming an alliance,</i>

121
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,918
<i>there's a chance that the girls</i>

122
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,835
might want to have an alliance

123
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,587
after there's a few more guys
knocked off.

124
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,631
<i>If they do,</i>
<i>I'll just lead on with them</i>

125
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,591
<i>like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, that's a good idea."</i>

126
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,635
<i>But as far as the women</i>
<i>forming an alliance</i>

127
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,636
and making one, no.

128
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,638
It ain't gonna happen.

129
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,764
I already got mine.
I like mine.

130
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,860
KELLY:
<i>We're all hungry</i>

131
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,822
<i>and we're low on energy,</i>
<i>and there's still no one else</i>

132
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,991
<i>providing any food</i>
<i>except for Rich.</i>

133
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,326
And we're having
to ration the rice.

134
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,786
You don't have
to put

135
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,287
both bowls on right now, Rudy,

136
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,330
is what
I'm saying.

137
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:54,997
Don't be
stubborn.

138
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:55,498
RUDY:
I ain't stubborn.

139
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,582
I'm going to eat

140
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,168
if everybody's
going to eat.

141
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,294
Okay, okay.

142
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,671
I ain't above eating.

143
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,006
<i>Having nine people,</i>
<i>it's, uh...</i>

144
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,800
<i>everything gets smaller again.</i>

145
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,510
The rice pot got smaller,

146
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,846
the sleeping quarters
got smaller.

147
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,347
We got four,
five bags...

148
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,016
So it's four bags there,
so we got eight meals there

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,143
so that's four days.

150
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,854
Or, no, that's only two days.

151
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,648
So, a can's only going
to last us two days?

152
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,568
We're eating that much.

153
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,361
We have to ration
it, then.

154
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:29,240
So instead of making
three pots tonight

155
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,575
we should make two pots
twice a day.

156
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,909
RUDY:
When we go
over there to eat,

157
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,994
the majority rules.

158
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,370
Yeah, two pots.

159
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,705
SUSAN:
<i>I wish some of the other people</i>

160
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,332
<i>would start conserving</i>
<i>a little more...</i>

161
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,208
<i>people that are being pigs.</i>

162
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,086
I'll only eat one bowl
at a sitting.

163
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,255
<i>I'm planning on staying</i>
<i>until the end,</i>

164
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,715
<i>so I really want</i>
<i>to have something</i>

165
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,591
for the last couple of days.

166
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,248
<i>We have our fisherman;</i>
<i>it's Rich.</i>

167
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,459
<i>That's Rich's job.</i>

168
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:21,751
Oh, wow. Two?

169
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,753
Four.

170
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,087
Four?

171
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,422
(<i> laughing</i> ):
What a catch.

172
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:27,757
A ray, a parrot fish,
a catfish

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,176
and a nice little nurse shark.

174
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,637
Baby's gonna have
some protein today.

175
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,974
GERVASE:
<i>Greg showing up, going out</i>
<i>trying to spear a fish.</i>

176
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,059
They've got nothing.

177
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,602
I'm not going to do
any better than they will.

178
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,772
<i>And I think Rich</i>
<i>is in a great position.</i>

179
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,106
<i>We vote Rich off,</i>

180
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,107
we don't eat.

181
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:45,775
Get the torches going.

182
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,777
Get everything
happening.

183
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,987
This is big time,
guys.

184
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,283
Rich, Rich, Rich,
Rich, Rich!

185
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,494
RICHARD:
Now, which one of
you sons of bitches

186
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,454
wrote my name
on a card
last night?

187
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,747
(<i> laughing</i> )

188
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,123
The bastard didn't get
a fish.

189
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,124
Yeah, he's out of here.

190
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,334
I'm starving.

191
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,877
RICHARD:
<i>As far as who voted for me</i>

192
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,836
<i>at the Tribal Council</i>
<i>last night...</i>

193
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,631
and I'm not certain who it is.

194
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,840
I'm thinking
it was probably Greg

195
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,594
<i>who felt threatened by me.</i>

196
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,971
But it could have been
any of them.

197
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,139
<i>I've only been with them</i>
<i>a day or two</i>

198
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,975
<i>and I'd not brought in</i>
<i>any fish.</i>

199
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,603
<i>Today, on the other hand</i>
<i>I brought in a huge catch.</i>

200
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,229
<i>Three rays...</i>

201
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,231
They just lapped that up.

202
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,943
That one's
pretty meaty.

203
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:29,944
GREG:
Let's make
them dead

204
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,028
so they can
stop suffocating.

205
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,446
(<i> loud smack</i> )

206
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,531
Aah!

207
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,824
You guys, I mean,

208
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,492
there's no other
humane way

209
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:37,785
to do that?

210
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,995
It seems humane to me.

211
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,079
Right through its brain.

212
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,498
<i>I could eat rice</i>
<i>for 17 more days.</i>

213
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,958
<i>I could eat rice</i>
<i>the whole time,</i>

214
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,626
<i>but they're loving the fish</i>

215
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>and it seems to make people</i>
<i>feel great,</i>

216
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:51,507
and I squeeze every ounce
of credit out of it that I can.

217
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,175
Susie-Q, look at that, please.

218
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,635
I know,
I said

219
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,011
they look
beautiful.

220
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,845
Dang, Rich!

221
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,180
Those rays
look really good.

222
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,182
We're all very proud
of you, Richie.

223
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,475
It's the most fish
we've had.

224
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,768
Good.

225
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,571
Watch Susie perk up.

226
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,782
She just gets a little protein
and she's back in the race.

227
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,908
GREG:
<i>Rich is playing a big game.</i>

228
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,411
<i>I think Rich thinks</i>
<i>he's very clever.</i>

229
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,872
<i>He has a lot of things</i>
<i>going on in his mind</i>

230
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,415
<i>that he, uh...</i>

231
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,876
selectively decides
what he will share

232
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,960
and with whom.

233
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,007
Fear... comes from...

234
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,759
That's right.

235
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,885
It's useless.

236
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,261
I think religion

237
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,888
is what destroys
our society.

238
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,889
Whoa!

239
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,350
I think it's the reason
people treat

240
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,851
other people as if

241
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,770
they're lower
than themselves.

242
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,773
Rich, that's
ground-shaking.

243
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,484
RICHARD:
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>how Greg sees me.</i>

244
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,735
<i>I'm trying to figure out</i>
<i>whether or not</i>

245
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,904
he's trying to build
an alliance or pull me in

246
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,782
or make me like him in some way.

247
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,533
GREG:
It's kind of weird.
It's good and bad.

248
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,534
You should
give it a go.

249
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,786
RICHARD:
Thank you, buddy.

250
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,790
Don't get that
stuff near me

251
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,750
with those funny faces.

252
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,417
JENNA:
<i>I'm seeing Greg</i>
<i>in a more devious way</i>

253
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,211
<i>than I've ever seen him before.</i>

254
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,253
<i>Since we moved,</i>

255
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,798
I saw him change<i> so</i> much,

256
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,802
and so transparently,
to me anyway,

257
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,763
that I've changed
my whole attitude towards Greg.

258
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,099
GREG:
<i>This scheme is interesting</i>

259
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,892
<i>in that you make friends</i>
<i>with people,</i>

260
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,561
<i>you make alliances</i>

261
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,605
and you have to
cut them loose at some point.

262
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,982
JENNA:
<i>Greg is working just about</i>
<i>everybody in the group.</i>

263
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,027
<i>I think he's always had Colleen</i>

264
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,237
wrapped around
his little finger.

265
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,780
It's not like that.

266
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,074
I mean, honestly,
if there was a girl here

267
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,410
<i>who I got along with</i>
<i>really, really well,</i>

268
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,120
<i>it would be the same thing</i>
<i>that way.</i>

269
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,287
<i>I feel</i>

270
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,122
like I have a friend

271
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,249
and I have somebody
who's my equal

272
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,792
that I can actually
have a conversation with.

273
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,294
Yesterday
night...

274
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,130
I'm voting for you next time.

275
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,590
Fine. See
what happens.

276
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,759
You're voting
for me.

277
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,678
GREG:
<i>This is the game.</i>

278
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,804
You bring
this little kitty along.

279
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,305
You have your little kitten,

280
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,474
<i>and you pet your kitten</i>
<i>and you enjoy this kitten</i>

281
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,309
<i>and the kitten sleeps with you</i>
<i>every night</i>

282
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,936
<i>and then, you're hungry, man.</i>

283
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,521
You look right
in the kitten's eye

284
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,814
and snap its neck.

285
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,023
It's nothing personal.
You're hungry.

286
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,317
The kitten has to give its life
for the next level.

287
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,695
What is it about your pet cat?

288
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,154
My pet
kitten?

289
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,322
Your pet kitten.

290
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,490
It's you,
kitty.

291
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,950
KELLY:
<i>I see him as being a chameleon.</i>

292
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,954
Changing his colors to fit
whoever he's around.

293
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,666
RICHARD:
<i>He's certainly interacted</i>
<i>with me</i>

294
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,460
<i>in an incredibly</i>
<i>interesting way</i>

295
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,878
<i>that suggests to me</i>
<i>that he's trying something</i>

296
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:38,299
that I'm very, very wary of
and that's great.

297
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,010
JENNA:
<i>Rich finds Greg attractive,</i>

298
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,679
<i>so Rich throws these</i>
<i>little innuendoes out there</i>

299
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,014
and Greg will just pick right up
on them,

300
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,642
sit right real close to Rich
and he's playing him.

301
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,521
Orgy, Greg?

302
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,522
Orgy?

303
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,523
Sure.

304
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,524
Have...
You have?

305
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,525
Oh, not right now?

306
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,319
He thought it was
an offer.

307
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,029
GERVASE:
<i>Greg and Rich have joked around</i>
<i>a lot.</i>

308
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,530
<i>We were talking one night.</i>

309
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,199
<i>Rich was getting real personal</i>

310
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,868
about his business,
and Greg was all in it.

311
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,370
You guys have never been
with another guy?

312
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,705
No.

313
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,706
Greg has.

314
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,707
I mean...

315
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,000
Rich, seriously?

316
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,210
Just kid... kid stuff.

317
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,961
That's what
freaks me out.

318
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,046
I mean...
well...
I mean...

319
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,006
No, I...
You...

320
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,883
GREG:
<i>I think, uh, Rich likes</i>
<i>to flirt with everybody,</i>

321
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,428
and instead of directly
shutting him down,

322
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,555
I only played his game back.

323
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,890
He's the shy one
on tape.

324
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,557
I didn't expect that.

325
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,060
I'll tell you the story later.

326
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,686
RICHARD:
<i>He's manipulative.</i>

327
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,939
<i>He's trying to win me over</i>
<i>in some way.</i>

328
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,942
<i>He's just not going about it in</i>
<i>bright enough a way for me.</i>

329
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,111
I would like to spend more time
with him and get to know him,

330
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,239
but... I would also rather have
the million dollars

331
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,449
<i>than to have somebody</i>
<i>like him around to worry about.</i>

332
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,097
Oh, gee.

333
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,807
What the hell is that?

334
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,227
Oh, boy.

335
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,104
Oh, no way.

336
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,105
"It takes skill
to carve the arc.

337
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,732
"May your aim be true
and find its mark.

338
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,401
"Archery is the sport of kings.

339
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,152
A reward from home is
what victory brings."

340
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,153
Oh, my, my.

341
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,282
I'm never going
to win anything

342
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,450
(<i> laughing</i> ):
around here.

343
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,619
Got a little bit
Bows and arrows.

344
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,787
SEAN:
<i>You know, if it has</i>

345
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,622
anything to do
with something from home,

346
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,915
I'd like Jenna
to win it.

347
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:35,583
Thank you, Sean.

348
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,292
I hope it's
my pictures.

349
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,294
They might have
our family send

350
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,628
a care package...
everybody.

351
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,630
They'll just give you
the care package...

352
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,173
KELLY:
<i>The reward is going</i>
<i>to be something from home</i>

353
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,427
<i>and, um, Jenna's thinking</i>
<i>it's-it's our pictures</i>

354
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,430
that we got to bring, and, like,
she<i> really,</i> really...

355
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,180
She misses her daughters
terribly.

356
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,016
Aren't you excited?

357
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,142
I love this stuff.

358
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,686
I'm going to go home
and be, like,

359
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,104
"Oh, I got to do bows
and arrows."

360
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,440
SUSAN:
Wow.

361
00:14:59,523 --> 00:14:59,982
Okay, Jenna,
Too high.

362
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,109
Is that how you hold it?

363
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,153
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Oh.

364
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,988
SUSAN:
<i>It's guys against girls, too,</i>

365
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,156
'cause this
is very even

366
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,532
because these
bow and arrows...

367
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,658
and these
arrows are...

368
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,201
<i>none of them are straight.</i>

369
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,202
Go, Kelly.

370
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,537
Keep your
finger over it.

371
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,497
Okay, put the
string up.

372
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,832
Now, pull her.

373
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,500
Even if you want to

374
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,376
<i>keep it at a angle.</i>

375
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,715
Nice, Rudy.

376
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,017
Who's on the boat?

377
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,310
I think it's Jeff.

378
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,811
RICHARD:
Bringing news

379
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,228
of the competition, I bet.

380
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,271
Oh, hi, Jeff.

381
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,193
It better be something
really good.

382
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,861
I'd rather have food
than anything

383
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:46,654
from home right now.

384
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,864
I would so much
rather have food.

385
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,532
It probably<i> is</i>
a refrigerator,

386
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,160
but what are we going
to refrigerate, our rice?

387
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,662
Maybe it's got
food already.

388
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,162
It's ice cream
sandwiches.

389
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,163
Okay.

390
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,707
(<i> chuckles</i> )

391
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,708
Move the crate.

392
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,293
Perfect.

393
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,091
Oh... a TV.

394
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,885
Okay, now, before
we begin today's
reward challenge,

395
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,179
I'm going to show you
some short clips of video

396
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,555
sent from home.

397
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,556
The winner

398
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,307
of the archery
contest gets

399
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,851
to watch their
entire video.

400
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,520
With that...

401
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,064
I give you this,
a little something from home.

402
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,316
Okay, "a little something
from home."

403
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,275
That's cool.

404
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,694
Hi, Dad.

405
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,112
Um, I hope you're doing
very well.

406
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,905
That's my kid.

407
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:30,948
Aw...

408
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,116
I'm doing pretty well.

409
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,200
Um... I hope

410
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,869
you come back with the million.

411
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,579
Uh, like I said in my letter,

412
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,083
I just...
I just wish you lots of luck.

413
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,167
Yay.

414
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,419
(<i> laughing</i> )

415
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,920
That's sweet.

416
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,130
RICHARD:
Yeah,
that's really cool.

417
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,631
It<i> is</i> cool.

418
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,758
Okay.

419
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,385
Hi, Kelly.

420
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,386
Hi.

421
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,387
I hope you're doing good.

422
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,639
You'll probably win,
but I miss you anyway.

423
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,348
I'm ready for you to come home.

424
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,308
So, eat your rice, keep smiling

425
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,602
and, uh, come home

426
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,438
and let's go kayaking.

427
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,939
I'm ready to go.

428
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:04,940
Peace.

429
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,941
(<i> laughing</i> )

430
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:06,608
I don't know.

431
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,569
Maybe everybody in the room,

432
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,987
anybody who's watching this
right now

433
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,156
could just join in.

434
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,490
You make mama real proud.

435
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,366
Don't go shaming the family,

436
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,119
sleeping with everybody
on the island.

437
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,537
Just remember who loves you.

438
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,538
Sis-sis...

439
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,290
and she's thinking of you.

440
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,291
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

441
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,542
(<i> laughing</i> )

442
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,376
Oh, good, good.

443
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,962
All right.

444
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,338
I'm doing this off the top
of my head, so...

445
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,966
That's my husband
holding my dog.

446
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:31,967
Aw...

447
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,135
That's my dog.

448
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:33,552
You are me, I am you

449
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,804
and you are me.

450
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,641
Together, we make it
through eternity.

451
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,018
Not bad, eh?

452
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,811
You know, here's Stimpy.

453
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,106
He's going to come up
and give you a big kiss.

454
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,149
Here he comes.

455
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,358

SUSAN:
Oh...

460
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,620
my dog looks so unimpressed.

461
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,705
Missing you?

462
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,706
SUSAN:
Oh, yeah, she is.

Hi, Colleen.

464
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,833
We love you.

This is our
sign-off now.

469
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,216
Have fun.

Good luck.

471

That was so cute.

They're really cute.

Hi, Rudy.

474
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,473
I bet you're surprised

475
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,683
to see me
on the island with you.

00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,562
Just wanted to let you know
how much we missed you.

478
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,481
Look at Grandpa.

479
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,316
Hey, who is that?

00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,904
And whether you win or not,

482
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,865
I'm proud of you
for having been selected.

I hope
you're enjoying yourself

'cause I know you like
the challenge.

Take care.

That's a love letter.

Yeah.

All right.

It was nice.

Aw, there's my sister.

And I'm really sorry.

527
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,457
Oh, man.

528
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,507
Are we going to do
the archery now?

529
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,134
JEFF:
Well, there is
an upside to this

530
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:20,469
that still
includes you.

531
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,555
The reward for
today's challenge
is two parts.

532
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,390
One is a private screening

533
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,643
for the full tape.

534
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,937
The winner also gets to make
their own video postcard

535
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,479
and send it home.

536
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,480
And that one, Jenna,

537
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,107
I can guarantee you
will get there

538
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,277
'cause I'll put it
in the overnight
myself tomorrow.

539
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,820
So, one person's going to get

540
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,656
the whole kit and caboodle
tonight

541
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,866
and the others are going
to get nothing else.

542
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:50,832
Okay, so you're going

543
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,793
to get one arrow,
that's it.

544
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,462
Remember, the
one who shoots
their arrow

545
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,464
closest to the bull's-eye,

546
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,132
gets to see
their entire video

547
00:20:59,216 --> 00:20:59,549
and make one

548
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,511
of their own.

549
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,595
You guys
comfortable?

550
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,978
Nice.

551
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,354
Greg is on the mark.

552
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,565
I'll let you handle this.

553
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,151
The split...

554
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,071
Yeah, I'm
worried about that.

555
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,197
Good try.

556
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,533
Yay. You hit
the board.

557
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,409
Oh, I wanted
to see my daughters.

558
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,576
Go, Rudy.

559
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,412
Make it count.

560
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,414
Well, this ain't my bag.

561
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,963
JEFF:
Greg's still looking
good right now.

562
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,262
Close...
but no cigar.

563
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,388
Come on, Sue.

564
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,514
You guys...

565
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,225
JEFF:
Tim's waiting
to hear.

566
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,893
Waiting to hear
from you.

567
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,567
Well... not close.

568
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,319
Good luck, Kelly.

569
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,531
Good try.

570
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,783
Great try.

571
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,285
Nice try.

572
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,288
Mom and Dad
would love

573
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,166
to hear from
you, Colleen.

574
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,047
Good velocity.

575
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,590
All right, Gervase,
no big deal.

576
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,884
Come on, for
your little girl.

577
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,802
The entire...

578
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,766
Nice try,
Gervase. Nice try.

579
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,392
Okay, Rich.

580
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,811
Let's go, Richie.

581
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,232
Dead-Eye Rich.

582
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,484
Here he goes.

583
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,777
Last shot.

584
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,029
It's up to you.

585
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,576
No.

586
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,453
Congratulations, man.

587
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,579
Wait a minute.

588
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,581
Congratulations, Greg.

589
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,665
Thanks, guys.

590
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,460
JEFF:
So Greg is going
back up there

591
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,294
and watch his tape.

592
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,088
You can include
these guys if you want.

593
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,130
You can do whatever
you want with it.

594
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,173
Of course.

595
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:03,882
<i>If it's going to be funny,</i>

596
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,967
<i>which I figured it would,</i>

597
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,969
I thought other people might
get a kick out of it.

598
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,638
At least she could provide
entertainment for other people.

599
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,974
Mukaluka, mau-mau, ping-ping.

600
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,601
(<i> clicking tongue</i> )

601
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,603
How are you doing?

602
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,022
I miss you very much.

603
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:19,606
(<i> kissing sounds</i> )

604
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,150
That's right, ping-ping.

605
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,487
RICHARD:
<i>I didn't think Greg's tape</i>
<i>was unusual.</i>

606
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,029
<i>I expected that</i>

607
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,031
and was excited by it.

608
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,032
You could tell

609
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>she was having fun</i>

610
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,285
<i>and knew he would laugh</i>
<i>at what she was doing</i>

611
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,162
<i>and I was laughing.</i>
<i>I loved it.</i>

612
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,665
Any circumstance
you find yourself in,

613
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,834
you're not sure what to do--
you're in a quandary;

614
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,544
you're in a pickle;

615
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,837
you're in a bind;

616
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,672
think what Billy Joel would do.

617
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,756
Think about it.

618
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,341
(<i> laughing</i> )

619
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:50,887
Think, what would Billy Joel do?

620
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,016
Anything.

621
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,851
Let's talk about
who's probably

622
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,019
sleeping on the island
right now.

623
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,855
All the giant,

624
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,482
scary spiders are sleeping.

625
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,692
That's how mom used to put us
to sleep at night.

626
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,194
All the animals are sleeping.

627
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:06,736
You make Mom proud.

628
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,114
You make Mom real proud.

629
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,542
Just remember who loves you.

630
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,002
Sis-sis.

631
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,212
(<i> kissing sounds</i> )

632
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,339
(<i> silly grunting</i> )

633
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,177
SEAN:
<i>I definitely see Greg</i>
<i>differently now</i>

634
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,178
after seeing his video

635
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,721
and attaching a lit bit
of a family with him.

636
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,222
At least we know

637
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,891
he's not the only screwball
in his family.

638
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,350
Maybe it's a genetic trait
over there.

639
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,102
Okay.e on, buddy.

640
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:39,936
Hi, Julie.

641
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,230
I just want to say,
you know,

642
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:42,731
it was really special

643
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,025
for you to send me

644
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,569
and everybody here
what you did.

645
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,362
We feel like we could feel you

646
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,405
and we felt you.

647
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,948
Some of us felt you

648
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,742
and others just imagined
what it's like to feel you.

649
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,746
RUDY:
<i>I can't understand a guy</i>
<i>talking to his sister that way.</i>

650
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,041
It sounded like Greg
was talking, maybe, incest.

651
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,584
That's the way it sounded to me.

652
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,668
(<i> laughing</i> )

653
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,837
Why not make allusions?

654
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,797
It crosses all those borders.

655
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,133
And, God, what are people
going to think?

656
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,636
<i>And then, sexual allusions</i>
<i>for my sister?</i>

657
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,262
What's gonna happen?

658
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,265
Julie, we got to put up with
this for about two more weeks

659
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,935
and, uh, then we
might kill him.

660
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,354
Is that doing
you a favor?

661
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,980
(<i> laughing</i> )

662
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:24,731
Good work, Rudy.

663
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,816
Good job, Rudy.

664
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,692
RUDY:
Yeah.

665
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,285
JENNA:
<i>I can't imagine</i>

666
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,248
<i>anybody missing their kids</i>
<i>more than I do every night.</i>

667
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,961
Miss my beauties.

668
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,963
Miss Sadie and Sabrina.

669
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,844
<i>I can't imagine my mom</i>
<i>not getting the tape out.</i>

670
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,807
It would've done wonders
to see that my kids are okay.

671
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,768
To hear their voices.

672
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,813
To hear, "I love you, Mommy."

673
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,432
RICHARD:
<i>Yesterday was cool.</i>

674
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,476
<i>We had that reward challenge</i>
<i>with the bow and arrow</i>

675
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,186
<i>and the reward was, the, uh...</i>

676
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,855
videotapes from home,

677
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,025
and for me,
that was<i> way</i> better than food.

678
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,860
GERVASE:
<i>Now, seeing those videos of</i>
<i>everybody's family, it's, like,</i>

679
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,820
<i>even if you didn't</i>
<i>like somebody before,</i>

680
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,698
<i>you see that somebody</i>
<i>cares and loves this person,</i>

681
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,244
<i>so it makes it harder for me</i>
<i>to boot somebody off now.</i>

682
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,999
KELLY:
<i>I felt so bad for Jenna.</i>

683
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,668
<i>She practiced all morning</i>
<i>on that stupid bow and arrow</i>

684
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:12,505
and then it was just, like,
"Why bother" for her.

685
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,175
Those are my bruises
from the bow and arrow.

686
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,760
This is from the bow and arrow.

687
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:20,221
GREG:
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what her feeling is</i>

688
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,723
because now it seems like
she wants to leave the island

689
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,724
and see her girls.

690
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,560
This is going to make it
that much easier

691
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,020
when I do get kicked off.

692
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,855
I'm going to probably cry,
but you know what?

693
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,065
Then I'm going to get off
and go...

694
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,900
"What an adventure!"

695
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,902
And then I get to go home
to my kids, so...

696
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,237
GERVASE:
<i>Jenna is a threat to me</i>
<i>because she has kids</i>

697
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,907
and I have kids, so we're,
like, single parents,

698
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,868
<i>and if people feel</i>
<i>for single parents</i>

699
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,079
<i>and she's tugging on</i>
<i>people's emotions right there</i>

700
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,081
<i>and that can sway somebody</i>
<i>not to vote for Jenna,</i>

701
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:46,956
and that's a threat for me.

702
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,959
Gervase? I don't see him
doing very much.

703
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,925
SUSAN:
<i>The fact you have</i>
<i>more people here now</i>

704
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,136
<i>and we're having to forage</i>
<i>for more food</i>

705
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,971
and there's a lot more slackers
on this other team.

706
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,435
SUSAN:
<i>Gervase. He's a nice guy.</i>

707
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,396
I don't like feed...
I don't like feeding

708
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,606
people like that,
though, you know
whaYeah.ean?

709
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,899
That's where I'm...
That's where I'm
coming from now.

710
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,777
GERVASE:
<i>My work philosophy is this:</i>

711
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,113
<i>Rich is, like,</i>
<i>the resident fisherman;</i>

712
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,155
<i>Rudy's the cook;</i>

713
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,324
<i>Sean is hauling in wood</i>
<i>every day--</i>

714
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,785
<i>you know, it seems like</i>
<i>everybody has a role here--</i>

715
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,246
<i>and I'm just sitting back</i>
<i>relaxing.</i>

716
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,124
Watch me-- I'm going to work
that boy till he's gone now.

717
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,333
He bugs me.

718
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:30,917
GREG:
<i>Gervase is honest.</i>

719
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,876
<i>He's not playing</i>

720
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,961
<i>anybody else's game.</i>

721
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:33,962
<i>I've said over and over</i>

722
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,297
<i>that he was an example</i>

723
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,258
<i>for people</i>
<i>thrown out of their element</i>

724
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,844
to really succeed and have
a great time, which Gervase has.

725
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,470
I got a king.

726
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,055
(<i> laughing</i> )

727
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:44,973
GERVASE:
<i>How have I survived this long?</i>

728
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,684
<i>I always said when I came here,</i>

729
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,935
<i>I was going to be</i>
<i>the entertainer.</i>

730
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,854
The cards man--
I'm glad you brought them.

731
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:54,149
It adds a new dimension
to island life.

732
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,818
GERVASE:
<i>I'm not trying to do anything</i>

733
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,194
shifty or shady;
I'm just being me

734
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,280
and people like me
because that's who I am.

735
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,990
Gervase is not that charming,
trust me.

736
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,033
<i>He's a slacker,</i>

737
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,077
<i>so he won't be around long.</i>

738
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,213
Hey.

739
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:17,964
"Pull me."

740
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,966
Oh, look at this.

741
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,719
"If you want to win immunity

742
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,804
"at the next challenge,

743
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,014
just slip onto the right rope
and run."

744
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,475
"Beware of dead ends.

745
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,018
"The prize you seek...

746
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,186
"is waiting...

747
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,021
at the end of the line."

748
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,023
Wow, that
sounds hard.

749
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,317
A significant amount of luck
with this one.

750
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,361
Oh, you've got
to love that.

751
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,988
At least this way,
I have a chance.

752
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,990
JEFF:
<i>Day 24 on the island.</i>

753
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:48,036
<i>Since the merger,</i>
<i>nothing has been more important</i>

754
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,037
<i>than voting strategy.</i>

755
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,706
The gears are churning.

756
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,041
Nobody is safe.

757
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,042
The only way to stay
in this game:

758
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,920
win today's immunity challenge.

759
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,970
JEFF:
Here we are--

760
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,181
immunity time... again.

761
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,726
"Into the Line" is a rope course
designed to be confusing.

762
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,772
<i>It's a jungle rope maze with</i>
<i>five checkpoints along the way.</i>

763
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,899
<i>Your job is to collect</i>

764
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,441
the colored carabineers

765
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,068
at every checkpoint.

766
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,569
Here's the only hiccup:

767
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,905
you have to be attached
to the rope course at all times

768
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,907
with your carabineer
you have two of them.

769
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,408
At certain points, you're going

770
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,785
to come to a junction--
these trees.

771
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,994
You can't get past them.

772
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,621
You have to take your
other carabineer,

773
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,082
reattach...
then you can un-attach...

774
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,458
now spin around, maneuver,

775
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,377
however you want to do it.

776
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,420
The only thing
you have to keep in mind

777
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,589
is one of these
has to be on at all times.

778
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,091
Also at each checkpoint
are several ropes

779
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,093
that lead directly

780
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,095
<i>to the next checkpoint,</i>

781
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,888
but several ropes
lead to dead ends.

782
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,306
<i>If you hit a dead end,</i>

783
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,142
<i>you've got to backtrack</i>
<i>to your last checkpoint</i>

784
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,936
<i>and choose a new line.</i>

785
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,230
The first person
to reach the end of the course

786
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,565
with five carabineers

787
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,899
gets immunity.

788
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,694
The tighter, the better?

789
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,701
Survivors, ready...

790
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,076
go!

791
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,074
What's happened to us?

792
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,825
We're idiots!

793
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,409
Oh, dude.

794
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,372
(<i> cheering</i> )

795
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,875
Wow! work, man.

796
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,085
Congratulations.

797
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,503
Give me five!

798
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,087
Very good. Very good.

799
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,171
Yes!

800
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,882
Well earned.

801
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,258
Yes!

802
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,092
KELLY:
<i>I knew coming here that</i>
<i>we'd have to vote people off.</i>

803
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,301
<i>What I didn't bank on</i>
<i>was the feelings</i>

804
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,221
<i>that you'd have</i>
<i>towards these people.</i>

805
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,975
<i>I feel like I feel</i>
<i>every Tribal Council</i>

806
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,101
<i>only it gets worse</i>
<i>every time.</i>

807
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,603
I feel like a backstabber.

808
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,730
I feel like a liar.

809
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,402
God, some people
are so nervous, it's sick.

810
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,738
It's sick how nervous
some people are.

811
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,948
RUDY:
<i>People are all looking</i>
<i>around a little more</i>

812
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,451
<i>because it's starting</i>
<i>to get down to the wire,</i>

813
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,286
<i>and evidently,</i>
<i>we're the only ones</i>

814
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,955
with a plan right now.

815
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,834
Once it's past the
next council,

816
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,169
we're invincible.

817
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,129
Right now we're
not invincible.

818
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,299
The voting now
should get very interesting.

819
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,843
If people are fear- and
self-preservation motivated,

820
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,011
<i>they'll band together.</i>

821
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,471
<i>They'll form alliances.</i>

822
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,347
<i>They'll start beating</i>
<i>people out.</i>

823
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,099
<i>Fear-motivated</i>
<i>self-preservation</i>

824
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,768
is the worst game
I can imagine.

825
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,479
KELLY:
<i>How do you, you know,</i>
<i>stay true to yourself</i>

826
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,188
<i>and maintain integrity</i>

827
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,440
and still play this game?

828
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,317
And you know what? You can't.

829
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,987
Yeah, I think that
would look better.

830
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,739
Yeah, tell Rudy that.

831
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,658
RUDY:
<i>It's cut and dried that we can</i>

832
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,620
<i>eliminate somebody every time,</i>
<i>and if we don't,</i>

833
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,998
I'll have to break
somebody's kneecap or something.

834
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,667
SUSAN:
<i>So as long as everybody</i>
<i>can keep their mouth shut now.</i>

835
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,169
Kelly's a little freaky.

836
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,004
She's gets a little going.

837
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,006
<i>I'm like, "Just shut up.</i>

838
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:54,801
<i>Just vote this, and shut up."</i>

839
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,219
KELLY:
I keep telling myself

840
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,970
"Well, I have enough friends.

841
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,347
I didn't come here
to make friends," and da-da-da.

842
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,724
And the truth is,
I like these people.

843
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,433
GERVASE:
<i>This is a game.</i>

844
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,185
<i>You're allowed to do this.</i>

845
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,311
<i>This is a game.</i>

846
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,356
<i>Alliances are fair game.</i>

847
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,067
<i>My thing is, we should always</i>
<i>have the upper hand.</i>

848
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,860
We should've voted Rudy...

849
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,987
We should have voted
for Rudy at first

850
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,865
and then, next vote,
vote your conscience.

851
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,158
Always keep the upper hand

852
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,536
because if they try something,
you can stop it.

853
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,371
SUSAN:
<i>As far as there being</i>
<i>a counterstrategy</i>

854
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,707
from the other side, yeah,
there is some fear about that

855
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,209
because we haven't got
enough of them voted off yet.

856
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,337
COLLEEN:
<i>We have</i>
<i>the upper hand right now, easy.</i>

857
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,381
We have four people
that we could come together

858
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,925
have a vote, and get
the next person off.

859
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,105
Welcome to Tribal Council
number eight.

860
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:33,733
You guys are now
the final core group of nine.

861
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,402
Two of you will make it,
survive long enough to get

862
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,486
to the final vote.

863
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,780
The other seven of you

864
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,158
will return to be
the jury that delivers

865
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:45,161
that vote, so no matter
who gets voted off,

866
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,412
from this point forward,
when they get voted off,

867
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,623
we'll all be back here

868
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:53,085
in 15 days to determine
who leaves with $1 million.

869
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,462
So, Richard,
bearing that in mind,

870
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,965
how do you balance
the ruthlessness

871
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:58,466
required to get

872
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,135
to the final two

873
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,806
with the likability needed
to get the final vote?

874
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,475
Good question.

875
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,811
I'm not even exactly sure
what my strategy's going to be

876
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,481
as to who I'm going to vote for
from week to week.

877
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,816
I'm just going
to keep getting fish,

878
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,485
feeding people--
hope they're happy.

879
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,445
How about
you, Gervase?

880
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,698
You're wearing immunity;
tonight you're fine.

881
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,158
Same thing applies to you.

882
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,826
How do you find that balance?

883
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,620
Just... I'm winging it.

884
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,497
Every day out here,
I'm just winging it.

885
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,832
I like everybody here, you know,

886
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,501
and after seeing their videos
of their families,

887
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,628
I can put faces
with them now.

888
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,671
I see they have

889
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,839
loved ones like I do
caring about them,

890
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,467
rooting for them,
so it makes it a lot harder.

891
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,971
Jenna, how surprised
were you last week

892
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,682
to see Gretchen
get voted off?

893
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,975
I was very surprised.

894
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:53,187
I would've thought she would
have made it to the final two,

895
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,815
but when we merged,
strategies had to shift

896
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,193
and it looked like they
were getting rid of leaders,

897
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,696
so, from here on out,
if I get voted off,

898
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,698
I'll wear it
like a badge of honor

899
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,408
when I walk
down there.

900
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,451
Susan, straight up,
is there an alliance?

901
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:12,373
No, not that I...

902
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,293
I vote people off
that I don't care for,

903
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,088
you know, that really would
irritate me if I was

904
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,841
working with them at a job
or something like that.

905
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,676
Here, I got a chance
to vote them off.

906
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,052
I can get rid of them.

907
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,887
It's, like, yeah!

908
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,056
Kelly, same question.

909
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,599
Do I have to answer?

910
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,059
I'm just kidding.

911
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:37,898
Has your voting strategy changed
now or will it change tonight?

912
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,485
I vote for who I don't
particularly like.

913
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,072
I vote for who I don't want
to spend the next 15 days with.

914
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,241
Colleen, would you do
whatever it takes

915
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,159
to get this money?

916
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,619
Would you play sides
against each other?

917
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,620
No.

918
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,080
Just not important
enough?

919
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,081
Right.

920
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,625
What brought you here
if it's not the money?

921
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,793
I mean, I'm here

922
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,086
for the money, too.

923
00:38:59,170 --> 00:38:59,670
I mean, give me a break.
Of course.

924
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,881
But the thing is that

925
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,883
everybody's here for the money,
you know?

926
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,761
I'm not going to listen
to everybody's sob stories

927
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:07,762
and then weigh them.

928
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,763
That's ridiculous.

929
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,474
Everybody wants the money.

930
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,017
All right. Gervase?
It's time to vote.

931
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,114
My vote is for Jenna.

932
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,783
I think she's really missing
her kids now.

933
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,242
She didn't get
the videotape.

934
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,577
There's not a letter for her,

935
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,288
so, you know, I think
it's really hurting her,

936
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:35,539
so this is her ticket.

937
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:50,137
Keeping with my strategy
of alphabetical order,

938
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,264
I'm voting for Greg tonight.

939
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,266
It would have been
Gervase's turn, but he won

940
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:54,934
immunity, so I had to skip him.

941
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,144
Next person in order is Greg.

942
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,898
I don't think this vote is
going to mean very much.

943
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,710
First time for paranoia,
second time for irritation

944
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:26,715
and third time because
my ear infection is clearing up.

945
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:40,396
♪ Good night, sweetheart,
yeah, it's time to go. ♪

946
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,564
No more competition.

947
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:46,610
Talk to you later, Greg.
Bye-bye.

948
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,668
As always I'd like to remind you
that once the votes are tallied,

949
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,336
the decision is final

950
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,589
and the person will be asked
to leave the island immediately.

951
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,799
I'll read the votes.

952
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,765
"Jenna."

953
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,233
"Jenna."

954
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,323
"Jenna."

955
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,124
"Greg."

956
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:46,629
"Greg."

957
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,766
"Greg."

958
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,768
Three votes for Greg,
three votes for Jenna.

959
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,483
"Greg."

960
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,660
"Greg."

961
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,453
No!

962
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:20,788
(<i> mock sobbing</i> )

963
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,671
JEFF:
Take care, Greg.

964
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:32,091
That's all I need.

965
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,801
Bye, everyone.

966
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,098
Greg, the tribe
has spoken.

967
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,310
It's time
for you to go.

968
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,395
Bye, everybody.

969
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,354

970
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,480

971
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:48,232
RUDY:
I believed him
for a minute.

972
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,109
RICHARD:
You believed him, Rudy?

973
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,110
For a minute there.

974
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,194
When the tears fell.

975
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,654
Look at the tears
back there.

976
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,991
That's it
for tonight's Tribal Council.

977
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,493
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

978
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:00,536
Good night.

979
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,809
<i>Next week on</i> Survivor:

980
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:24,810
I'm just being honest.

981
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,354
If you can't take
the honesty...

JENNA:

I haven't seen or heard
anything from my kids.

989

A twist of fate
that maybe some
didn't expect
