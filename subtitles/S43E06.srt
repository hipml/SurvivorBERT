00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,302
- but I'm just saying, like...
- Get Cody?

497
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:52,314
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.
What do you think?

498
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:54,302
- I'm okay with that. Yeah. Yeah.
- That's...
I'm totally okay with that.

on tonight for me, and I'm

501
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,544
<i>- definitely nervous.</i>
- I've made

502
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,682
a better connection with James

503
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:01,004
- than I have with Cody.
- Yeah.

504
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,302
- So far. <i>
- CASSIDY: Me and Elie</i>

505
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,974
talked about voting together.

506
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:05,992
<i>And I feel like us girls
could kind of get together</i>

507
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,174
<i>and maybe do something.</i>

508
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,238
<i>Unfortunately,
that means it's Cody tonight.</i>

509
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:16,205
ELIE:
I think that we're down
to team up with Coco,

510
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,450
- 'cause that's an easy majority.
- So you just tell me

511
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:21,241
<i>the name so I know where to go.</i>

512
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:23,344
<i>ELIE:
I mean, we don't have
to beat around the bush.</i>

513
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:26,174
- I would like to work with Coco.
- Okay.

514
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,715
And so that means
you and Cassidy are safe.

515
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:30,547
I don't want to vote out a Baka,

516
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,715
and that means
Owen and Sami are safe.

517
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,307
- Okay.
- Not gonna vote for myself.

518
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:36,073
<i>- Yeah...
- JAMES: Okay.</i>

519
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:37,785
- Uh, yeah.
- You don't have
to say anything else.

520
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:40,307
<i>I pulled Elie aside
to see where she wanted to go.</i>

521
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:41,793
She didn't want
to give me a name,

522
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,786
and then she reluctantly
gave me Cody's name.

523
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:48,336
<i>I want to keep her very
confident, but I'm not with her.</i>

524
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:50,098
<i>She doesn't
tell me anything, and</i>

525
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:51,336
I don't trust her.

I haven't eaten a real meal,

531
00:22:04,827 --> 00:22:06,307

532

<i>I don't even know
what the tastes are.</i>

536
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:14,544
<i>I'm just trying to stuff it
as much as possible.</i>

537
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,516
<i>So sorry.
Manners out the door.</i>

538
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,520
I'm so sorry, Nana.
I'm so sorry, my mom.

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,520
RYAN:
My mom loves dragon fruit.

540
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,140
Does anyone want a beer?

541
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,691
- Would that be crazy?
- GABLER: Yeah, I'll have a beer.

542
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:27,073
- Who wants a beer?
- I'd like a beer.

543
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:28,722
- Here, darling.
- Thank you.

<i>We're having a great time
because we're safe.</i>

545
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,860
That means that we don't have to
come back to camp and scramble.

So, tonight.

Yeah, let's, like... What's...

00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:47,613
- What's the scoop?
- RYAN: What's the plan?

553
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:49,065
We could be the final seven.

554
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:53,971
That's the thing.
We could be the final seven.

555
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:55,718
We have the numbers.
We got this spot

556
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:57,377
by winning today.

557
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:00,337
<i>JEANINE: Ryan starts
talking about how it makes sense</i>

558
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,409
<i>that the seven of us are strong,</i>

559
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,547
and I'm not
interested in his pitch.

560
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:06,025
<i>It's just a little ridiculous,</i>

561
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:07,967
<i>the fact that we're just gonna</i>

562
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:10,188
become an alliance because
you boosted me up a ladder.

563
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:12,335
<i>I have my own
alliance at this point.</i>

564
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,788
So we need
to find somebody that,

565
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,647
you know, would help us
get further in the game.

566
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:19,829
NOELLE:
Yeah. I mean, I do have
a good relationship with Cody.

567
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,281
- RYAN: Mm-hmm.
- KARLA: Okay.

568
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,682
- I'd like to keep Cody.
- I'd love to keep Cody.

569
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:25,724
I'd like to keep Owen and Sami.

570
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:27,067
JEANINE:
I'd like to keep Elie.

571
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:29,787
<i>KARLA:
It was pretty evident that</i>

572

<i>everyone wanted
everyone to stay,</i>

573
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,968
with the exception of Gabler.

574
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:36,168
Elie went through my bag
on day three.

575
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,480
So that's something for me
that I remember.

576
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,686
<i>KARLA:
I was just like,</i>

577
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:44,973
"Uh," and then
I took a sip of my beer,

578
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,658
because this
is one of those moments

579
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,828
<i>where you're just like,
"Oh," you know?</i>

580
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:51,931
<i>It is very evident
that Baka is fractured.</i>

581
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,210
<i>JEANINE:
Gabler. Oh, my God.
In that moment,</i>

582
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,830
my jaw drops, because I am just

583
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:01,901
<i>flabbergasted that he would
just throw her under the bus</i>

584
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,900

what comes out</i>

585
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,958
of that man's mouth, especially
in front of me, who...

586
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,450
He knows it's gonna
get back to her.

587
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:10,716
It's gonna be pretty tough
for all of us to vote unanimous.

588
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:12,588
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

589
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:15,239
<i>GABLER:
Everybody was fractured,

<i>And by throwing out</i>

591
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,756
Elie's name, I was trying to...
throw out Elie's name.

592
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:23,412
<i>The trust has been broken with
me and Elie since day three.</i>

593
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:26,687

594
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:29,213
<i>that I know are enemies
that are plotting against me.</i>

595
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,690
<i>And if I can
do that with people,</i>

596
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:36,003
<i>then we build a little bit
more trust together, because</i>

597
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,647
if we're gonna vote Elie out,
it's today.

598
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,589
<i>I want to look like
I'm decisive and trustworthy.</i>

<i>to not just talk to talk

601
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:46,587

<i>I have heard that

I searched your bag
on day three,

00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:15,137
and I have literally
never searched your bag.

625
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,521
I have no idea
where you got that information.

626
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,100
Owen and Sami said they saw you.

627
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:21,199
They told me that you looked
through my bag with Jeanine.

628
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:22,411
Well, it's not true.

629
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:24,167
Why would you
throw me under the bus?

630
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,065
You've been throwing me
under the bus, too.

631
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:28,972
I have not.
That's the thing, Gabler.

632
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:30,992
- I'm not playing like that.
- Somebody went through my bag.

633
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:33,244
- I still felt...
- Was it Jeanine? Who was it?

634
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,544
- Somebody did it.
- I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not like that.

635
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,376
It's important
for you to do that.

636
00:26:37,482 --> 00:26:39,142
- I'm not like that.
- Okay.

637
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:41,061
- Then I-I got to assume
that you guys were together.
- So...

638
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:42,693
Of course.
Jeanine is my best friend.

639
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:44,337
Does Jeanine
have a hidden immunity idol?

640
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:45,789
- Did she find something?
- Yeah.

641
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,206
Yeah, but nobody told me, right?

642
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,751
Why would I tell you
someone else's business?

643
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:50,992
I'm not gonna
tell your business...

644
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:52,199
Am I your ally
or am I not your ally?

645
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:55,031
I feel you have turned on me.

646
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:56,377
All right, well, it's not true.

647
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,342
We wanted to stay Baka strong.

648
00:26:58,448 --> 00:26:59,992
- I have not faltered.
- Then you should have
shared information with me

649
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:01,716
when you could have, and brought
me in and kept me in the loop.

650
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:03,578
- So...
- Well, I have
to go talk to other people

651
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,302
- I know. I know.
- Because you have now put me

652
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,509
on the chopping block, and
I have to deal with that, so...

653
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:10,001
- I don't know that it was me.
- It was you.

654
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:13,413
<i>We talked in circles,
and there was no budging.</i>

655

He's not believing me at all.

656
00:27:15,172 --> 00:27:18,212
<i>So Owen and Sami
really screwed me over.</i>

657
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,000
You told Gabler that I
searched his bag, and I did not.

658
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:22,613
And then he told
everybody at the feast

659
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:24,065
that I was searching his bag.

660
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:26,142
He got my name.
He said from you and from Owen.

661
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:29,071
- What? You-you...
- He told my name to everybody

662
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:30,862
- at the merge feast
to vote for me.
- Yeah.

663
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,205
<i>What the hell?</i>

664
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,830
<i>Gabler blew everything up.</i>

665
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,451
<i>Now Elie is suspicious of me.
And she has enough skill</i>

666
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:39,241
in this game to turn it
right back around on me.

667
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:41,764
<i>So we got
to make her feel comfortable.</i>

668
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:44,026
ELIE:
The two of you told Gabler
that I searched his bag.

669
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:46,718
<i>- I, first of all,
I did not search his bag.
- I didn't tell him.</i>

670
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:48,958
- Does Gabler want to vote for
you? Or is he just trying...
- ELIE: Yeah. Yeah.

671
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,380
<i>OWEN:
Gabler threw Elie
under the bus.</i>

672
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:53,592
<i>And now she is panicking</i>

673
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,169
that she is gonna get voted for
by basically everyone

674
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,655
for being a snake.

675
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:59,338
I don't know
what he's talking about.

676
00:27:59,448 --> 00:28:01,026
OWEN:
I think he's just scared of you.
I don't know what it is.

677
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:03,068
Then I-I need you to help me
clear my name then.

678
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:04,785
- SAMI: Yes...
- Like, if y'all are legit.

679
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:05,992
- We got it.
- I trust you both, and...

680
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:07,414
OWEN:
Who do you want to vote for?

681
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:10,233
- Okay.
- I want to get out there
and talk to people,

682
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:11,716
because I feel like
the longer it festers,

683
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,302
- I'm just not...
- OWEN: No, let's get out there.

684
00:28:13,344 --> 00:28:14,751
- Not trying to have, like...
- Okay, and whatever you do,

685
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,753
whatever you hear,
keep coming back to us, please.

686
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,971
<i>James would be a really
easy target to get rid of,</i>

687
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:28,028
<i>but Elie is so much more
of a threat to have around here.</i>

688
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:31,757
So I think
Elie has to go tonight.

689
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:37,518
So, you and Elie are sisters,

690
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,854
- and I get that, but...
- Yeah.

691
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:41,476
...somebody went through my bag.
I know it.

692
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,716
I also know that you guys found

693
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:46,857
the hidden immunity idol
out here.

694
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:50,205
- Actually, is it okay if we,
maybe, just talk?
- Yeah, yeah...

695
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,302
- Is that okay?
- I don't mind. I won't
disclose any information now.

696
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:54,130
- We'll see you in a minute.
- Thank you so much.

697
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:56,932
<i>Coming back to camp,
all hell broke loose.</i>

698
00:28:57,034 --> 00:29:00,104
Gabler goes off his rocker

699
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,786
<i>and keeps
throwing Elie under the bus</i>

700
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:04,026
<i>and starts telling
everyone that I have an idol.</i>

701
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:05,377
<i>I honestly don't know</i>

702
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,382
how this information
got out at this point.

703
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,312
I don't even care
to deal with it right now.

704
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:11,903
All I care about
is that people feel good

705
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,660
within the Baka five
enough to just vote together.

706
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:17,308
I think for this vote, guys,
we got to stay Baka strong.

707
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:19,164
- I agree. Please.
- JEANINE: We have to.
We have to.

708
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:21,826
We'd be so, so, so, so dumb
to implode right now.

709
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,524
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yeah.

710
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,061
<i>GABLER:
The problem is I don't know that
I can work in the game with her.</i>

711
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:30,343
That's fair, but we just got
to make it to the next step.

712
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:31,723
Me and Sami need our buffs.

713
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:33,967
- We can settle this later.
- Okay.

714
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:35,785
<i>JEANINE:
My main question is
is Gabler with us?</i>

715
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:38,067
<i>And I think he understood
where I was coming from.</i>

716
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:39,932
So hopefully
he'll stick true to his word,

717
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:41,454
<i>and we will vote together.</i>

718
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:43,451
SAMI:
Maybe just tone it down
a little bit,

719
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:45,371
<i>- 'cause Jeanine's got an idol.
- GABLER: I know.</i>

720
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:46,785
- She could play it for Elie.
- Yes.

721
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,167
So you got to keep things cool.

722
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:51,675
- That's all I'm saying.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Got you. Got you.

723
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,210
<i>ELIE:
Yeah. I'm freaking down.</i>

724
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,690
- I don't want to scramble.
- Yeah.

725
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:00,523
I want to trust, you know,
in the things

726
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,520
- that I talk about and say
and call it a day.
- Yeah. Yeah.

727
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,520
<i>JAMES:
Elie is still
saying Cody's name,</i>

728
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,690
<i>but I feel
something sketchy is up.</i>

729
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:11,313
So I need to talk to everybody

730
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:12,693
to see
where everybody's head at.

731
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:21,624
Yeah.

732
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,214
<i>According to James,</i>

733
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,620
<i>Elie put Cody's name
on the chopping block.</i>

734
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:28,314
<i>It seems like Elie's out here
trying to, like,</i>

735
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:30,693
make moves, and, like, you know,

736
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:32,958
<i>cause discord and spread
a little bit of misinformation,</i>

737
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,210
<i>from what I can tell.
And so</i>

738
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,590
Elie's name, you know,
was already out there by Gabler.

739
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:39,759
<i>And so I think
that's the way to go.</i>

740
00:30:43,862 --> 00:30:46,552
- Elie's the one...
- Elie's the one that's doing it.

741
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:49,715
<i>And I think that we need
to break up Elie and Jeanine.</i>

742
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:51,164
<i>- And...
- DWIGHT: Yeah.
I agree with that.</i>

743
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:53,686
- What's up, bro?
- What's up, buddy?

744
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:04,453
Elie.

745
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:05,661
All right.

746
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:17,026
<i>- KARLA: Okay.
- CASSIDY: If we can get Gabler,
we have the numbers</i>

747
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:19,302
- to get Cody out.
- Gabler's not gonna
vote that way, though.

748
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,314
- You don't think?
- No. Gabler wants Elie out.

749
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:22,593
He may give it to me.

750
00:31:24,689 --> 00:31:25,829
Frickin' Elie and Jeanine,

751
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:27,691
guess whose names
they're throwing out.

752
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:28,693
- Who?
- Who?

753
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:30,213
- You two.
- Shut up.

754
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,590
I swear to God.

755
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,209
<i>JAMES:
Damn.</i>

756
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,790
<i>Elie was targeting Cody,
and now she's coming after me.</i>

757
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,476
<i>I knew that I couldn't
trust her, but then</i>

758
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:40,716
a lot of people don't trust her,

759
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:42,408
<i>and that's good for me.</i>

760
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:46,661
So it's important
that Baka votes James.

761
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,718
<i>Everyone in Baka
is voting James.</i>

762
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:50,277
- James?
- Yeah.

763
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,030
- Can we do this? Now's the time.
- Yeah.

764
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:54,757
No, I understand.
I understand.

765
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:57,342
<i>Jeanine is really scrambling</i>

766
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,208
<i>to try to get me on board,
but it's too little, too late.</i>

767
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,480
<i>We're still not</i>

768
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,966
Baka strong.
We're a Baka... show.

769
00:32:04,068 --> 00:32:06,478
<i>These people think
that they've got me fooled,</i>

770
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:09,096
<i>but I know what's going on here.</i>

771
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:10,516
<i>I'm being played.</i>

772
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,170
<i>So I'm gonna vote Elie tonight,
and that's it.</i>

773
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,509
- He just came to me, he said...
- Why would I ever trust him?

774
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:21,761
I'm gonna go home.

775
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:29,037
- Okay?
- Okay.

776
00:32:29,137 --> 00:32:30,095
- I'm down.
- No, I know.

777
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:31,967
I'm the one without any power.

778
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:35,068
<i>I thought I was in a position
where I could call the shots,</i>

779
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:37,212
<i>but now I think
I might be going home.</i>

780
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,340
<i>Fortunately, Jeanine might be
willing to play her idol for me.</i>

781
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,308
<i>Either way, it's gonna be
a real trial for me tonight,</i>

782
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:45,593
<i>and I don't want Gabler</i>

783
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:48,069
to be the person
that crafts my exit out.

784
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:50,172
♪ ♪

785
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:57,379
♪ ♪

786
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,761
♪ ♪

787
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,210
Wow. A lot of people.

788
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,830
- [laughter]
- A lot of people.

789
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:27,481
PROBST:
All right, so, big day.

790
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:29,826
The result
is seven people are safe.

791
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:33,621
Six people still
have to get to the merge.

792
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:36,454
So, Gabler, what happened
when the seven of you showed up

793
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:39,171
and now we have 13 people
all back together in camp?

794
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:41,545
GABLER:
We started off
at the merge meal.

795
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:43,335
There was a little bit
of talk of strategy,

796
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:46,933
and then we leisurely
walked back in, and boom,

797
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:48,314
everything just exploded.

798
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:50,343
I thought
I was gonna go lay down

799
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,588
and just try
to digest for an hour...
- [laughter]

800
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:54,859
...and I have
not stopped talking all day.

801
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,475
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, Jeff. It's gonna be

802
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:58,717
very interesting
this evening, I think.

803
00:33:58,827 --> 00:34:00,377
PROBST:
Cody, how'd you see it?

804
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:02,406
- Oh, it was nutso.
It was complete chaos.
- [laughter]

805
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:04,095
There was, there was
no organized chaos going on.

806
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:06,277
- It was a dust storm.
- Really?

807
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:07,829
CODY:
Absolutely crazy.

808
00:34:07,931 --> 00:34:11,101
- It was almost nauseating. Man.
- DWIGHT: It was a lot.

809
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:13,376
PROBST:
So, Sami, tonight
there are essentially

810
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:15,762
seven people
who have individual immunity.

811
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,212
What are you feeling?

812
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,854
Because you're one of the six
that's in trouble.

813
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,896
SAMI:
Honestly, as soon as
we lost the challenge,

814
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,720
all I could think about
was how scary it is

815
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:27,547
to be vulnerable
versus being safe.

816
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:29,995
It gets to the point where
every conversation that

817
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:31,923
you have with somebody, every
look that you give somebody,

818
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:33,205
it really matters,

819
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,930
because it gets back to you,
at some point.

820
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,820
- PROBST: Cassidy,
you were nodding.
- CASSIDY: Yeah, it's true.

821
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:39,522
And it's hard to know
what dynamics

822
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,480
are going to shift
when you bring

823
00:34:41,586 --> 00:34:43,164
a certain group of people
together, you know?

824
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,066
And anything that anybody
tells you could be a lie,

825
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:48,592
it could be the truth, and it's
really hard to differentiate.

826
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:50,619
So it can form bonds,

827
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:53,524
but it can also
cause chaos, too.

828
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,760
Jeanine, how is this vote
different now that

829
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:59,342
we are into the individual
portion of the game?

830
00:34:59,448 --> 00:35:01,928
It could not be more different
than a-a tribe vote.

831
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:04,794
Like, we're all trying
to gauge not only what is best

832
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:07,656
for our individual game,
but what is every other

833
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:10,028
individual thinking
is best for their game.

834
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:12,687
And that's just, I don't even
know what factorial that is,

835
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:15,313
but 13 to the 12th?

836
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,723
Like, that just, there's
so many permutations of people

837
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:20,167
working together
and thinking different things.

838
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:22,825
PROBST:
Elie, Jeanine just hit
on something so important,

839
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:26,171
which is you have to look
at the game from every single

840
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,785
person's point of view,
and it gets very complicated.

841
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,306
Yeah. Everybody's
got their own mission.

842
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,440
Everybody's got their
own goals and their checklist.

843
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:34,832
And so today was no different.

844
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:37,481
I was thrown a little bit,
because, all of a sudden,

845
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:40,546
my name had at least, you know,
had-had bubbled to the surface.

846
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:44,135
And in that moment, I'm like,
"Oh, this is <i>Survivor?</i>

847
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:47,691
Like, what have I been playing?"
And so I felt really panicked.

848
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:50,173
And spending a lot of time
with somebody who doesn't

849
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,685
see me as an asset,
that's a wasted five minutes.

850
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:55,213
And in this game,
five minutes could be your life.

851
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,790
PROBST:
Wow. So, Owen,

852
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:59,616
is it that tight
that you really have to decide

853
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,594
where you're gonna
spend your time?

854
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:04,379
Right. Trust is the only
currency we have out here,

855
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:06,142
and that's
the beauty of <i>Survivor</i>

856
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:08,761
is that you can
never trust anyone 100%.

857
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,212
We can only trust ourselves

858
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,100
in trying to figure out
who trusts me.

859
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:15,306
Do I trust them?
And, like, all the possibilities

860
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:17,763
that come after that,
it makes your head spin.

861
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:20,312
So it was, uh, it was
an exhilarating afternoon.

862
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:23,973
So, Karla, there had
to be talk of advantages,

863
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,928
idols, Shot in the Dark,
all the things

864
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:29,314
that could change
or blow this Tribal up.

865
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:30,723
Of course. Right. You...

866
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:32,997
Not only do you have
a combination of alliances

867
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,453
or just people working together,

868
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:37,791
but there's been nine people
on journeys already.

869
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,336
You don't know what people
have and what's out there.

870
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,998
And so that adds
another element of stress.

871
00:36:44,103 --> 00:36:46,933
And, Gabler,
when you have an advantage

872
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:49,384
or an idol,
you don't want to play it

873
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:51,902
if you don't have to,
'cause you want to save it.

874
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,410
Absolutely, Jeff.
That is riding the razor's edge.

875
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:56,657
You know, the people
that have idols or advantages

876
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,406
in their pockets,
playing them at the right time

877
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:00,308
is the masterful piece
of <i>Survivor.</i>

878
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:01,763
And if you play 'em wrong,

879
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:03,662
you've got bad jewelry
to go home with.

880
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:06,548
PROBST:
So, Sami,
it sounds like there were

881
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:08,130
at least some discussions
where people said,

882
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,342
"So-and-so might have this,"

883
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:11,448
or "So-and-so has this"
or "I have this."

884
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,302
- Were you a part of that?
- Yeah, and I think

885
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,854
one of the more
important things is, like,

886
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:17,166
the way that those advantages
and idols are played,

887
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:18,889
whether they're played
the right way or not,

888
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:22,521
can change the way that people
view an alliance, you know?

889
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,410
If you said you had somebody's
back and they went on ahead

890
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,717
and played an advantage
or an idol or something,

891
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:30,167
what does that tell you
as a person in a group?

892
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:31,440
That tells you
they didn't really

893
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,522
come in here trusting you.

894
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,917
James, couldn't have said it
better than what Sami just said,

895
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,445
and yet,
it doesn't solve anything,

896
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:41,031
because if
you think you got to play it,

897
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:43,547
you got to play it, because
you got to get to tomorrow.

898
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:46,135
For me, I'm just like,
"Hey, I trust the people that

899
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:49,241
I've talked to,
and it makes pragmatic sense."

900
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:51,454
The vote I'm gonna make tonight,

901
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:53,381
just trying
to not flunk kindergarten, Jeff,

902
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:55,282
and move forward.

903
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:58,099
PROBST:
Jeanine, if you look at what
Sami's saying a different way,

904
00:37:58,206 --> 00:38:01,376
he might really be saying
that sometimes a big move

905
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:03,522
is to not make the big move.

906
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,170
If you're right,
it can lock you like this.

907
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:09,445
If you're wrong, your torch
is here and you're gone.

908
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:13,411
This is a game
of paranoia versus gut.

909
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:16,027
And the difference
is paranoia is very present,

910
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:19,207
and gut is the ability
to latch on to things

911
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,030
that are behind you that

912
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:23,927
you can look back on and say,
"My gut instinct is that

913
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,440
that relationship
in the past worked,"

914
00:38:25,482 --> 00:38:27,142
or, you know,
"I can trust that person."

915
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:30,521

so caught up in the momentary
