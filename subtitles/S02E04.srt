1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:03,837
>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,089
Michael was determined to make a
kill.

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,257
>> MICHAEL: This is the pig-
killer.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,427
>> JEFF V.: His stupid spear.
"I'm going to go catch pigs.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,263
Go get me a pig."
>> JEFF: At Ogakor, Jerri and

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,890
Colby whispered sweet nothings
to each other

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,684
>> COLBY: Black coffee, or cream
and sugar?

8
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:21,020
>> JERRI: Cream and sugar.
I'm such a sucker for cowboys.

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,939
>> JEFF: In the toughest
challenge yet, Kucha won

10
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,942
immunity...
(<i> cheering</i> )

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:29,487
...sending Ogakor to Tribal
Council, where lines were drawn

12
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,573
when Jerri made it clear who her
friends were.

13
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:35,243
>> JERRI: I've been very
fortunate in my ability to bond

14
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,747
with Amber, Mitchell and Colby.
>> JEFF: But there was no bond

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,124
with Maralyn, who was voted out
of the tribe.

16
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,209
It's time for you to go.
13 remain.

17
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:53,261
Tonight, one more will go.
>> TINA: I had slept outside

18
00:00:53,344 --> 00:02:02,038
Tonight, one more will go.
>> TINA: I had slept outside

19
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,874
last night, as did Keith.
We were the first ones up, so we

20
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,584
thought the first ones up, let's
just get up and go fishing this

21
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,213
morning.
So we cleared everything off the

22
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,883
boat, got the fishing rods
together.

23
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,220
Jerri popped up out of the tent,
ran, turned over the canoe...

24
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:22,183
and acted like she was going to
get ready to go fishing.

25
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:27,772
>> MITCHELL: You guys wanna go?
(<i> canister rattling</i> )

26
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,899
You're going to take this?
>> KEITH: Yeah.

27
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,901
Jerri and the others, they
wanted to take the canoe out.

28
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,945
You know, we said, "Well, we're
just getting ourselves ready,

29
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:37,115
we've got all our gear, we're
getting ready to go."

30
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,367
"Oh, we were going to do that."
Well, isn't that ironic, you

31
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,535
know, just 'cause<i> we</i> were going
to go?

32
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,413
>> TINA: Well, that's why we
were going to go, because you

33
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,248
guys were sleeping, so...
(<i> Jerri groans</i> )

34
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,293
I just said "Look, you know, we
were gonna go fishing.

35
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,753
You all were asleep.
We're going to go fishing."

36
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,423
And apparently, Keith wanted to
have a talk with me, so he said,

37
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,300
"Well, Tina, let's just go walk
along the bank and fish that

38
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,762
way."
>> KEITH: At Tribal Council last

39
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,472
night, Tina and I had an
opportunity to get a little bit

40
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,809
better understanding of where we
sit within our own tribe.

41
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,477
When Jerri was asked the
question who her friends are,

42
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:10,231
she made a point of mentioning
Amber, Colby, Mitchell and

43
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,608
herself, that they all get along
best.

44
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,736
And then, of course, she wanted
to make sure that everybody was

45
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,904
clear that she was here to win
the money.

46
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,948
And she's going to do whatever
she has to to win the money.

47
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,076
So, Tina and I were a little
miffed by that.

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,455
>> TINA: You have four or five
young people playing.

49
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,292
You know, they've got so much
chemistry that it is almost

50
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,171
second nature just to-- whoo--
just immediately gravitate

51
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,591
towards one another.
And it makes me feel kind of

52
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:40,303
like an outsider, which I am an
outsider at this point.

53
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,932
>> JERRI: It's all I can do to
keep from just laughing out

54
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:48,978
loud.
At Tribal Council, Jeff asked me

55
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,149
who I felt I had built
friendships with.

56
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,860
And immediately after I said it,
I kind of sucked it back up,

57
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,445
because I realized I was
basically challenging people to

58
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,656
vote for me.
Which doesn't put me in a very

59
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:05,036
good position.
>> KEITH: Jerri is perfect for

60
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,455
this game.
She will ride the team until

61
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:12,043
it's time to take the knife out
and cut someone's throat.

62
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,380
>> JERRI: That was good stuff.
>> KEITH: I didn't come out here

63
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,341
to be pushed around by a
bartender-wannabe-actress.

64
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,679
Maybe it's time just to shake
her world up a little bit.

65
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,181
I can tell you one thing: Tina
and I are not going to go down

66
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,474
without a fight.
I came here to win the money,

67
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:30,061
but now my motive isn't to win
the money, but to do everything

68
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,855
I can to make sure she does<i> not</i>
win the money.

69
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,871
>> ALICIA: Wow, what is it?
>> RODGER: I have no idea.

70
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,374
>> ALICIA: You guys are not
going to believe this one.

71
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,835
>> KIMMI: What?
>> RODGER: We got a chicken egg.

72
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,504
>> ALICIA: We have a real egg.
>> RODGER: "For a change of the

73
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:00,258
menu, you must work with great
haste.

74
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:07,390
Build a pen on your beach, and
slide the pieces in place."

75
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,516
This morning, we received tree
mail.

76
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,937
And I went out there to it, and
it was a bird's nest.

77
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,565
And it involves a challenge of
building a chicken coop.

78
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:20,945
>> ALICIA: Grab one end.
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

79
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,573
>> KIMMI: Okay, all of these are
pretty much straight.

80
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,743
I definitely have to appear that
I'm into this challenge, because

81
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,746
my head was on the chopping
block-- I know, with a couple of

82
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,749
people-- because of, um... you
know, my almost not eating the

83
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,543
worm and the cow brain thing.
At least this chicken coop thing

84
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,837
is a little bit of a change of
pace.

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,589
I know it might seem ironic,
because I don't eat mammals.

86
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,592
You know, I haven't had poultry
in over ten years, and I haven't

87
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,511
had red meat in over 15 years,
but if it boosts up morale for

88
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,513
these guys, it's going to be
good.

89
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,099
>> NICK: Oh, yeah.
>> MICHAEL: See, what I can do

90
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,101
is I can pry this over with my
pry bar here...

91
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,228
>> JEFF V.: I want those
chickens so bad.

92
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,814
For one reason, so Mike will
quit fishing and walking around

93
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,276
here flexing his muscle.
I really want chicken.

94
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,446
And I'm not above snatching it
out of the other team's arms.

95
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:12,497
I want a chicken.
>> JEFF: Okay, today's challenge

96
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:20,171
I want a chicken.
>> JEFF: Okay, today's challenge

97
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,800
is a reward challenge.
And the map to your reward is

98
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,512
scrambled in a puzzle.
The first tribe to completely

99
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,640
unscramble their puzzle gets
three egg-laying chickens and

100
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,936
one rooster.
Big reward, a lot of eggs.

101
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,606
Pick your spots, and we'll get
started.

102
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,403
Playing for three egg-laying
chickens and a rooster.

103
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,573
Survivors ready?
Go!

104
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,789

it up.

>> AMBER: Bring this one up and
we'll bring this one down, over

00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,503
here.
>> COLBY: Right here.

108
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,672

this whole side, so now we can

111
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,682
work this... we got to do this
piece...

112
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,016
>> NICK: Yeah, swing this one
like this.

113
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,352
Goes... no, leave that.
>> RODGER: Doesn't that blue

>> NICK: It goes in the middle.

115

>> RODGER: It goes in the
middle, that's right.

116
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,483
>> KIMMI: Those two need to be
together.

117
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:36,038
That should be one, two, three.
>> COLBY: No, no, no, no.

They could eat a chicken every

159
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:11,027
other day and be totally fine,
until the merger.

160
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,739
And I thought to myself,
"Consume those chickens as

161
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,576
quickly as possible so we're
back to being hungry again."

162
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,745

>> RODGER: Shh...

163
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,540
>> NICK: We woke up in the
morning, Rodger and I, relocated

164
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:26,417
the chicken coop, got them
comfortable.

165
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,210
And then all of a sudden I
see Mike preparing to kill the

166
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,880
rooster.
Everybody else is sleeping, and

167
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,717
I said, "Let's wake up, figure
out what our day schedule is a

168
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,012
little bit more before we kill
it because if we had killed that

169
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,514
rooster, a lot of people would
have been upset.

170
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,392
We have to make decisions as a
group for us to get along.

171
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,062
...we should decide as a group
when we're going to eat it.

172
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,772
>> RODGER: That's-that's what I
asked him...

173
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,523
>> MICHAEL: That's what I just
asked you.

174
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,733
>> NICK: We don't need one
today.

175
00:10:50,816 --> 00:11:00,743
(<i> rooster crowing</i> )
>> ELISABETH: That one's going

176
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:10,836
first.
>> AMBER: There's a fire.

177
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:31,440
first.
>> AMBER: There's a fire.

178
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,985
You can actually hear the trees
falling down and burning.

179
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,910
>> TINA: You can hear it.
I'll put on my tennis shoes.

180
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,455
It seems to be getting closer
and closer.

181
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,249
You can see ash blowing in the
wind.

182
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,794
We have no idea how close it is
to our camp, even though we know

183
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,797
that it has to cross the water
in order to get to us.

184
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,551
>> AMBER: It's a concern, um...
But you know, I think we'll be

185
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,678
safe, as long as we head for the
water and everybody does the

186
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:10,646
right thing.
>> TINA: And you don't realize

187
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,691
that you're nothing to Jerri?
She said, "I'm in it to win,"

188
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,402
and you know, she's going to do
whatever it takes to win.

189
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,155
>> MITCHELL: Yeah.
>> TINA: She sees that we've got

190
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:19,989
the fishing poles out, jumps
out, grabs the boat, turns it

191
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,825
over.
And it's like she has to have

192
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,161
her way.
>> COLBY: Yeah.

193
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,247
>> TINA: And I am so over it, I
just can't hardly stand it.

194
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,292
I mentioned my frustration with
Jerri because it's building.

195
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,003
I don't know if it's just me.
Do other people feel the same

196
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,005
way I feel?
>> COLBY: It's going to get a

197
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,175
lot worse before it gets better.
>> TINA: I'm sorry.

198
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,676
She's the most bossy,
domineering person I've ever

199
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,178
met.
>> COLBY: She's coming, by the

200
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,973
way.
>> MITCHELL: Mm-hmm.

201
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,852
(<i> sighs</i> )
>> TINA: It was a little bit of

202
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,854
it just wanting to see how
strong does Mitch and Colby

203
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,900
align with Jerri.
And my thought was, if I could

204
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,193
get Colby, that would be two of
us.

205
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,989
And then maybe Colby could talk
to Amber, and that would be the

206
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,116
only chance that I would have to
make it.

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,578
At this point, I don't have
anything to lose.

208
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,042
>> COLBY: I had to get out of
the tent.

209
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,378
There's a little estrogen
overload in the tent right now,

210
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,214
and I just couldn't deal with
that.

211
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,090
Tina was taking things way too
personally.

212
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,885
>> KEITH: What happened last
night at Tribal Council is what

213
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,387
really set Tina and I apart.
Jeff said, "Well, who are your

214
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,515
friends?" and Jerri named, you
know, four individuals.

215
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,600
>> COLBY: Right.
>> KEITH: And Tina and I are

216
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,893
sitting on the sideline.
So that was, you know...

217
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,731
Tina and I just figured, "Well,
it's just a matter of time now."

218
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:39,443
>> COLBY: The powers that be
have predetermined long ago the

219
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:43,405
pecking order here, and also the
elimination order.

220
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,115
And, uh, Keith is up.
Keith and I have spent a lot of

221
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,285
time together.
Part of my reason for doing it--

222
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,120
one, we get along.
Two, we need Keith right now, so

223
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,207
the last thing I'm going to do
is alienate him.

224
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,626
>> KEITH: I'm cohabiting with
people who... what do I do with

225
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,086
these people?
>> COLBY: Yep.

226
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,673
>> KEITH: Who knows, man?
You and Jerri could get married.

227
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,049
>> COLBY: I know that ain't
happening.

228
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,717
>> KEITH: Tell you straight on
right now, she ain't good enough

229
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,387
for you.
And you know, it's cool you guys

230
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,973
got your little thing going, but
I'm gonna tell you right now,

231
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,558
she ain't no way good enough for
you.

232
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,767
>> COLBY (<i> laughs</i> ): That's
funny.

233
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,269
>> KEITH: I would beat you like
a dog if I found out you two

234
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,144
hooked up.
>> COLBY (<i> laughs</i> ): Well,

235
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,106
thanks, bro.
>> KEITH: That girl would cut

236
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,109
your throat in a heartbeat.
>> COLBY: Yeah, you're right.

237
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:25,197
(<i> Rocky crowing</i> )
>> RODGER: Everybody's on the

238
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,949
same wavelength-- we want to
have chicken today.

239
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,661
>> MICHAEL: I got a confirmation
from Nick and Jeff, and

240
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,289
Elisabeth said yes.
And if us four are saying yes,

241
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,166
everybody says yes.
>> KIMMI: I say no. Okay.

242
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,336
(<i> sputtering laughter</i> )
I guess that doesn't work.

243
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,630
>> ALICIA: Nope. I say do it
whenever you want to do it.

244
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,464
Just let me know when.
>> KIMMI: Yeah, 'cause I want to

245
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,259
know...
>> RODGER: Well, we've got to

246
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,136
get the water going.
I would love to have fried

247
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,430
chicken tonight.
It would be the first meal where

248
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,140
we didn't have to pass a piece
of fish around six or seven

249
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,309
times and everybody take a bite
of it.

250
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:57,646
Everybody would have their own
piece of chicken.

251
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,273
>> MICHAEL: Oh, it's boiling.
>> RODGER: Boiling?

252
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,568
>> MICHAEL: Boiling.
Rodger...

253
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,823
Do we need anything besides
tools?

254
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:12,953
>> RODGER: Just a hatchet and
a block of wood.

255
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,707
>> KIMMI: Alicia, I'm leaving.
>> ALICIA: Bye, sweetie.

256
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:28,802
I know it's harder for her.
>> RODGER: Just gotta look at

257
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,554
it, it's no different than
eating them fish we've been

258
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,391
eating.
I'm gonna hold his wings.

259
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,646
Just-just make it a good... one
good, clean blow.

260

>> ALICIA: Mm, mm, mm!

261
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,070
>> MICHAEL: Everybody was loving
the chickens.

262
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:51,075
This could be the end of the
game for me, because they no

263
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,327
longer need me for a food
source.

264
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,082
It ups the stakes definitely for
me to catch the food.

265
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,043
But to stay in the limelight is
going to be harder and harder

266
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,672
because you've got to keep one-
upping yourself.

267
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,716
I caught one fish, and then I
caught a bigger one, then I

268
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,218
caught three fish, then I caught
five fish.

269
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,345
What am I going to do now,
wrestle an alligator?

270
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,055

>> JEFF V.: I'll take a chicken

271
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,350
over fish any day.

272
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:22,981
you don't ever go back.

274
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,914
I'm hungry, I'm tired,
physically, emotionally, I'm

275
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:42,292
gone.
I feel that I think the most

276
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,253
about strategies, 'cause first
of all, I don't have much else

277
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,423
to think about.
And second of all, I want to go

278
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,259
far with this.
After seeing Colby and Keith

279
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,430
talking over in the water for a
couple of hours, who knows what

280
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,098
he's trying to convince Colby,
but you know what?

281
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,768
Maybe he's just kind of taking
Keith for a ride.

282
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,603
Colby had been talking a lot to
Keith.

283
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,606
We know Keith is trying to rear
something up from behind to try

284
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,651
to take one of us out.
>> JERRI: The only way it would

285
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,945
work is if Keith convinced Tina
and Colby...

286
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,156
>> AMBER: And Colby.
>> JERRI: ...to vote against me.

287
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,658
>> AMBER: Right, then...
>> JERRI: And you and us three

288
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,827
voted against Keith.
It would be three and three.

289
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,121
>> AMBER: A tie.
>> JERRI: And then you and me

290
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,247
with the most votes, I'd be
gone.

291
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,792
>> AMBER: Yep.
>> JERRI: This is definitely the

292
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,169
first time I've felt a little
bit threatened.

293
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:29,131
And I guess I deserve it after
making that pompous remark at

294
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,801
Tribal Council.
>> AMBER: Colby could be talked

295
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,345
into things easily.
>> JERRI: Yeah, that's what I'm

296
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,931
thinking, too.
>> AMBER: He's not real strong

297
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,309
in his opinion.
He-he sways a lot between what

298
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,269
people tell him.
>> JERRI: Colby does seem to be

299
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,981
the one we're focused on in
trying to ensure he's not

300
00:17:46,064 --> 00:18:00,829
changing his mind.
Ah...

301
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,832
There he is.
Did you find a good spear?

302
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,959
>> COLBY: Yeah, I made a couple.
>> JERRI: Yeah?

303
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,463
Cool.
Colby was pretty excited about

304
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,175
going out hunting for a pig.
And I think it's a brilliant

305
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,845
idea, especially with the fires
right now, 'cause a lot of

306
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,973
wildlife has been flushed this
way.

307
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,185
Fire pretty much stopped.
It's always a possibility that

308
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,895
it could jump the river and come
over here.

309
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,396
I think it's highly unlikely
because there's no wind,

310
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,318
nothing.
>> COLBY: See where all the

311
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,528
ground's burning right there?
>> JERRI: Yeah.

312
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,905
>> COLBY: The fire was right
there. See? It was right there.

313
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,323

We'd love to have a hog around
here.

315
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,036
They're here. We've just got to
find them, and I'm not

316
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,205
having a whole lot of luck.
But I'm bound and determined to

317
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,332
put pork on the plate before I
leave this place.

318
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,835
I mean, they're not going to
live on the water, I don't

319
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,838
think.
They're going to burrow back

320
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,589
aways, and I mean, I don't have
a whole lot of experience with

321
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,051
hogs.
>> JERRI: I think Colby is

322
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:59,888
definitely separating the game
from any relationship with me.

323
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,559
I think it takes a strong person
to do that, quite honestly,

324
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,687
especially when there's
obviously, you know, some

325
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,731
attraction between us.
>> JERRI: Where to, cowboy?

326
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,734
>> COLBY: I don't know.
We'll head this way.

327
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,444
Who knows where the heck we're
going.

328
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,406
Jerri's scared.
She's worried that Keith and

329
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,284
Tina and I are going to join
together and mastermind a back

330
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:24,705
door move to get rid of her.
I don't want you to lose an

331
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,292
ounce of sleep worrying about
what Tina's thinking or doing or

332
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,085
anything like that.
>> JERRI: I'm not losing any

333
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:33,172
sleep.
I'm just... I just know that

334
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,757
she's thinking ahead.
I just want to beat her to the

335
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,385
draw, that's all.
>> COLBY: I'm not saying I'm

336
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,469
holding out on making a deal
with you to see how this thing

337
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,932
plays out.
I'm saying there's no sense in

338
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,393
even making a deal, 'cause if we
go into the merge undermanned,

339
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:50,564
it's all for naught, you know?
>> JERRI: Don't worry about it.

340
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,316
You know, it's not like you're
making a deal with the devil

341
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:57,112
here.
I'm a little leery of Colby, and

342
00:19:57,195 --> 00:20:00,449
I can tell actually that he's
sort of distancing himself from

343
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,912
me a lot more.
And I like hanging out with you,

344
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:09,666
so, you know, it just makes
sense to me... to approach you

345
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,753
with it.
>> COLBY: I'll make you a deal.

346
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,963
It's me, you and Amber through
to the end.

347
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,257
>> JERRI: Make me a deal?
What is that?!

348
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,301
>> COLBY: Well, you were wanting
to strike a deal earlier.

349
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,639
Jerri probably wears a name tag
that says "puppet master" on it.

350
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,515
She loves having Amber in her
hip pocket, and Mitchell in the

351
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,311
same place.
I mean, I simply agreed to go

352
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,314
along with them just because I
thought it could get me down the

353
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,483
road a little better.
It's all good.

354
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,443
(<i> Jerri laughs</i> )
I want to win, and I don't

355
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,613
want to talk to anybody else
about loyalties.

356
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,658
Don't give me that crap.
I haven't trusted anyone since

357
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,326
day one, and anyone playing
smart should have been the same

358
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,536
way.
>> TINA: What about the pigs?

359
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,539
>> COLBY: Nothing.
>> JERRI: No luck.

360
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,749
>> COLBY: We didn't even see
anything.

361
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,043
I'm going to have to piggyback
your ass over this to keep you

362
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,797
dry.
>> JERRI: Oh, my gosh. Whoo!

363
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,133
Oh, you're all muscle.
>> COLBY: I'm going to need some

364
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,303
rest when I get back.
I'm gonna die.

365
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:30,122
(<i> snoring</i> )
>> NICK: Elisabeth?

366
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:44,469
(<i> snoring</i> )
>> NICK: Elisabeth?

367
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,847
>> ELISABETH: Yeah?
>> NICK: There's a pig in the

368
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,891
water.
>> ELISABETH: What?

369
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,518
>> NICK: There's a pig in the
water.

370
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,603
>> ELISABETH: A pig?
>> NICK: Yeah.

371
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,107
>> ELISABETH: There is a pig!
Right over there.

372
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,525
Oh, God, Mike's gone with the
knife.

373
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,177
>> MICHAEL: Why don't you guys
come and help me surround him.

374
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,472
You guys, I got him cornered
here.

375
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,312
Just keep walking around the way
you're walking.

376
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,150
>> NICK: Don't charge me.
>> MICHAEL: He won't.

377
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,277
You know, what I want you to do
is I want you to block off that

378
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,029
entrance there.
>> NICK: All right.

379
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:52,204
>> MICHAEL: Here he comes.
(<i> pig snorting</i> )

(<i> pig squealing</i> )
(<i> sighing with relief</i> )

381
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,353
>> NICK: We got a pig.
>> ELISABETH: What got it?

382
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,189
>> NICK: He killed it.
It was a gross thought, dude.

383
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,983
He had to, he had to...
I'm so glad Kimmi wasn't here.

384
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,527
>> ALICIA: Yeah. Where is she?
>> ELISABETH: If she was, she

385
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,112
would have died.
She would have died.

386
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,613
>> NICK: It was, it was...
>> ELISABETH: Brutal.

387
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,282
>> NICK: ...gross.
It was very gross and brutal.

388
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,496
>> MICHAEL: Life is just a funny
little blending of experiences,

389
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:39,543
and this is just another one.
How it will affect me at my end

390
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,003
of the tribe, I don't know.
It could go either way at this

391
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,131
point.
But if I go out, I'm going out

392
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:51,763
full.
And I'm<i> so</i> happy about that.

393
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:59,688
(<i> chuckling</i> )
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God.

394
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:04,526
Oh, this is like a murder scene.
>> MICHAEL: When I butcher a

395
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,778
deer, I use a hatchet and a
knife.

396
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,869
I think I need to cut the skin
more on the top now, too.

397
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,871
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

398
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,914
Oh, my God.
>> ALICIA: Lots of butchering

399
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,376
going on in Kucha camp today.
>> JEFF V.: This is nothing like

400
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,669
a chicken, that's for sure.
>> ALICIA: We've reached a new

401
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:27,757
level.
>> NICK: This is the craziest

402
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:36,057
thing I've ever seen in my life.
>> MICHAEL: This is how I'm

403
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,018
going to show up at the immunity
challenge.

404
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:38,894
>> RODGER : Pig blood...
>> ELISABETH: Did you just put

405
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,937
that on your face?
>> RODGER: Yeah, he did.

406
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,105
>> MICHAEL: Just like that.
(<i> Rodger cheering</i> )

407
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:47,235
>> ELISABETH: You're crazy.
>> JEFF V.: Mike caught a pig.

408
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,737
He actually caught a pig.
>> KIMMI: I cannot deal with

409
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,699
these people.
I cannot... How big of a pig?

410
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,703
>> JEFF V.: It's a little one.
And there's going to be a lot of

411
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:03,210
ham and bacon and pork coming up
in here... soon.

412
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,420
>> KIMMI: What is wrong with you
people?!

413
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:08,798
This is sick.
We live in a sick tribe.

414
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:22,437
>> MICHAEL: These are pure,
fleshy steaks.

415
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,273
>> ALICIA: The fact that Mike
had the guts to go after that

416
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,775
pig says a lot about Mike's
character.

417
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,778
I can appreciate the fact that
Mike did that, you know?

418
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,280
And-and Mike did that for the
tribe.

419
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,075
Mike killed this pig for us so
we can all eat.

420
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,409
We're having a barbie.
>> RODGER: Mmm... that's

421
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:40,956
cooked...
>> JEFF V.: Oh, my God.

422
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:48,964
Mmm...
>> ALICIA: It's good, right?

423
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,133
>> MICHAEL: I feel better about
my position now that I've made

424
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,011
this kill.
I think my position in the tribe

425
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:59,641
has come up a few levels, and...
it's a good feeling.

426
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,519
>> ELISABETH: Whoa, we're going
to get strong now.

427
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:30,755
>> COLBY: A little bit of love.
"You all read the books and

428
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,218
crammed for the test.
So now it's the time for

429
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,180
survivor knows best.
Head down to the falls with your

430
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:43,018
thinking caps on.
If you lose the next challenge,

431
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,813
one more will be gone."
>> JERRI: First merge with equal

432
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,690
equal amounts of people on both
tribes.

433
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,402
We can't lose another immunity
challenge, so the pressure now

434
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,697
is even more immense than it was
before.

435
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,868
But the next two immunities are
crucial for us and our survival

436
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:10,045
at the merge.
>> JEFF: Take back the immunity

437
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:18,845
at the merge.
>> JEFF: Take back the immunity

438
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,889
idol.
The immunity idol is now back up

439
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:25,852
for grabs.
So, last reward, you guys must

440
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,062
be eating pretty well.
>> JEFF V: We haven't really

441
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,939
been eating the chickens much
because yesterday we all went

442
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,193
out on a, uh, pig hunt and we,
uh, stalked a pig and, uh, we

443
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,363
put a spear right through its
heart and, uh, we've been eating

444
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,406
pig for about a whole day.
>> JEFF: Reaction? They caught a

445
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,408
pig.
>> COLBY: We'd like to have one,

446
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,369
too.
>> JEFF: You've been out looking

447
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,370
for a pig?
>> COLBY: Yeah, you bet.

448
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,039
>> JEFF: Well, today's
challenge-- certainly more

449
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,916
important than chickens or
roosters, even pork.

450
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:52,087
At the end of this challenge,
one tribe will return to camp

451
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,922
safe in the knowledge they're
secure for another three days.

452
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:59,761
The other tribe will head to
Tribal Council, and you will

453
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,222
vote another member out of your
tribe.

454
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,933
It's a simple question-and-
answer game.

455
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,893
There are six spots per tribe.
You'll start at the back and

456
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:11,147
move forward by filling in the
spots with correct answers.

457
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:15,068
Your goal: be the first tribe to
get right here on the yellow

458
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,278
spot and you get immunity.
All right?

459
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,780
Let's go.
Head down, pick the first

460
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:24,661
person.
Michael, Mitchell, come on up.

461
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:31,501
Multiple choice: it is possible
to improvise a compass by

462
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:37,257
magnetizing a needle which of
the following: A) silk; B)

463
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,345
cotton; c) hard wood; or D)
running water.

464
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,808
Show me your answers.
You both say A) silk.

465
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,436
That's right.
Take your first spots.

466
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,147
>> ALICIA: All right!
>> TINA: Good job! Good job!

467
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,860
>> JEFF: Elisabeth, Keith, come
on forward.

468
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:01,990
True or false: the number of
flies in Australia increased

469
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:07,495
after the arrival of Europeans?
You both say true.

470
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,081
True is correct.
Take your next spot.

471
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,421
All right, Alicia, Amber, come
on up.

472
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:23,720
In order to safely purify water,
it must be boiled for at least,

473
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:27,432
A) five minutes; B) ten minutes;
C), 15 minutes or; D) 20

474
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:34,022
minutes?
Correct answer: B) ten minutes.

475
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,567
Pick your spot.
(<i> cheering and whooping</i> )

476
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:44,949
Ogakor has a one-point lead.
Next two.

477
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,577
The answer is true.
Take a spot. We're even up.

478
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,328
(<i> cheering</i> )
Alicia and Jerri, back of the

479
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,372
line.
Colby, going against Jeff.

480
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,875
True.
>> Yes!

481
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,211
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> JEFF: Ogakor in the lead.

482
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,046
Kimmi says false, Jerri says
true.

483
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,882
False is right.
Kimmi, take a spot.

484
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,093
Alicia and Tina.
What was that little thing you

485
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,889
just did, Alicia?
Is that a little...

486
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,058
>> ALICIA: Just getting ready.
>> JEFF: Okay.

487
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,518
>> ALICIA: Third time's a charm,
hopefully.

488
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,896
>> JEFF: Of the ten most
venomous snakes in the world,

489
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:20,944
how many live here?
A) three; B) six: C) nine... or

490
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:25,114
D) ten?
Both wrong. It's nine.

491
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:30,370
See you again in a minute.
All right, Jeff, Jerri, you both

492
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:34,874
say true.
You're right. Take a spot.

493
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,586
Nick, Tina, you're both right.
>> NICK: All right!

494
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,421
>> TINA: Thank you, God!
>> JEFF: Take your spots.

495
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:45,426
(<i> whooping</i> )
Okay, Alicia, come on up.

496
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,556
And Mitchell, you'll be the tie-
breaker for Ogakor.

497
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:56,437
Here's what I'm thinking: I'm
thinking, this tie-breaker's a

498
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,565
little tougher on you, Alicia,
because Mitchell at least has

499
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,316
already answered one.
>> ALICIA: Right.

500
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,442
>> JEFF: He can always fall back
on that.

501
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,318
>> ALICIA: That's right.
>> JEFF: You haven't answered

502
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,445
squat.
You'll be leading the hike to

503
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,196
Tribal Council.
>> ALICIA: Thanks for telling

504
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,948
me.
Thanks for just reassuring me

505
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,116
like that.
>> JEFF: We're in a tie-breaker

506
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,285
situation.
If you both get it right, we go

507
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,329
again.
First person to miss, their

508
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,290
tribe loses, they go to Tribal
Council.

509
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,126
Multiple choice: Which of the
following animals have toxic

510
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:22,088
eggs which should not be
touched?

511
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:32,640
A) gowannas, b) cane toads, c)
akidnas or d) bearded dragons?

512
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:37,520
>> You both said B) cane toads.
You're both right.

513
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:41,357
Going to another question: When
building a fire, you should

514
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,820
never use dead wood to start the
fire, A);

515
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:52,201
B) situate your fire near a rock
slide; C) place wet rocks near

516
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:57,707
the fire; or D) use a car
battery to start the fire?

517
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:06,049
For immunity.
Mitchell says B) you should

518
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,677
never situate your fire near a
rock slide.

519
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:14,140
Alicia says C) you should never
place wet rocks near the fire.

520
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:18,519
C) is right.
Kucha wins.

521
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:28,196
(<i> wild cheering</i> )
Kucha, you get the immunity idol

522
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:38,289
back.
>> AMBER: We're feeling kind of

523
00:32:38,373 --> 00:33:00,561
back.
>> AMBER: We're feeling kind of

524
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,940
blah right now and we're not too
excited to make that hike again

525
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:07,652
tonight.
>> JERRI: And so we prepare once

526
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,321
again for the walk of shame.
>> MITCHELL: I'll have plenty to

527
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,240
say to the camera when I hold up
Keith's name.

528
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,786
He seems to be an instigator, a
few problems.

529
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:21,290
So, when he goes, it'll be a
sigh of relief for me.

530
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:25,962
>> KEITH: Jerri likes to think
that she is the leader in some

531
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,339
way because Amber and Mitchell,
she kind of leads them around a

532
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:33,094
little bit.
My goal tonight is to try to

533
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,097
step in and break all that up.
I'll offer my opinion to the

534
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,099
team and see what everyone
chooses.

535
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,768
>> COLBY: I don't think he has
any idea.

536
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,437
>> MITCHELL: Really?
>> TINA: He didn't take his

537
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,775
fleece or his jacket.
>> COLBY: This, by far, is going

538
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,611
to be the toughest council for
me because I don't agree with

539
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,614
the order in which the union
is voting.

540
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,535
Because the person to go tonight
is-is a huge asset and could

541
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,204
really, really be an asset down
the road.

542
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,694
>> JEFF: First I think I need to
address with you guys a fire

543
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,989
that is burning.
Keith, when you think about

544
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:38,868
that, that there truly is a
fire, does it hit you how real

545
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,996
it is out here?
>> KEITH: Absolutely.

546
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,207
And the fact that the fires are
burning so close, what they're

547
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,209
going to end up doing is pushing
things that are in the outback

548
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,670
towards us.
>> JEFF: What was your reaction

549
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,673
to the fact that Kucha bagged a
pig?

550
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,218
>> COLBY: I'm ticked off that we
don't have pigs yet.

551
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:59,013
I'm ticked off that I haven't
seen pigs or-or pheasants or

552
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,183
quail or anything of that sort,
but I'm not discouraged by that.

553
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:07,522
Why I'm upset is because I play
to win, and nothing else is

554
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,483
acceptable in any way.
>> JEFF: Sort of based on what

555
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,819
you just said, Colby, let me
make the observation of the day:

556
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,657
Kucha is kicking your ass, and
the question I have is: Does it

557
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,285
change your strategy tonight at
all in thinking about what tribe

558
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,372
do we need to take to this
merge?

559
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,084
>> TINA: That's the hardest part
about this game, because you are

560
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,837
pulled in so many different
directions.

561
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,548
You're pulled with loyalty,
you're pulled with self-

562
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,341
survival, you're pulled with
team survival.

563
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,344
And it boils down to you.
You're going to have to be the

564
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,347
one to make the decision.
And... it's brutal.

565
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,892
>> JEFF: Well, obviously,
tonight's vote is pivotal.

566
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:49,230
Behind me, three torches.
Two of the three-- Ogakor.

567
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:59,323
It's time to vote. Colby.
>> MITCHELL: Keith, you add some

568
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:25,975
It's time to vote. Colby.
>> MITCHELL: Keith, you add some

569
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:29,937
tensions with the group at
times, and my hope is that by

570
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,441
eliminating you, we eliminate a
little bit of that friction.

571
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,634
>> TINA: This was not my
original intended vote.

572
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,930
However, on the way here to
Tribal Council, a new scheme was

573
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,514
developed.
So, in the spirit of the

574
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:15,942
Olympics, let the games begin.
>> JEFF: I'll go tally your

575
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:25,993
votes.
Once the votes are tallied, the

576
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:39,340
votes.
Once the votes are tallied, the

577
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,176
decision is final.
The person will be asked to

578
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,804
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

579
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:53,896
First vote: Keith.
Keith.

580
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,489
Keith.
Three votes, Keith.

581
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:15,876
Mitchell.
Mitchell.

582
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,629
Three votes Keith, two votes
Mitchell.

583
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:34,937
We have a tie.
Okay, our first tie.

584
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,397
Here's how it'll work: Keith,
Mitchell, you will not vote.

585
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,570
The other four will vote again.
Obviously, big vote for Ogakor.

586
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,073
I think it's only fair that I
give each of you guys a chance

587
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,909
to plead your case, a chance to
say to the tribe why they need

588
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,581
you to be to beat Kucha.
Keith?

589
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,335
>> KEITH: I'm a competitor and I
will fight to the bitter end to

590
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:01,088
win for this team and continue
to do the heavy work that I've

591
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,883
contributed with the team thus
far.

592
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:08,137
I won't give up.
>> JEFF: Mitchell, why should

593
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,599
they keep you?
(<i> sharp exhale</i> )

594
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,186
>> MITCHELL: We all pulled a
little fast one on me, but...

595
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,772
but I agree with Keith,
actually.

596
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,399
I want you guys to win this.
I want you guys to go on.

597
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,569
I want you guys to beat Kucha.
And physically, mentally,

598
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:29,158
emotionally, I'm drained.
I wanted very, very badly to go

599
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:33,454
far in this game, but if these
next few challenges are strictly

600
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,290
strength, Keith is stronger than
I am.

601
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,500
I can't compete with that.
There's no way I can compete

602
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,585
with that.
>> JEFF: Okay.

603
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,796
We'll have a revote.
You will vote for either Keith

604
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:46,092
or Mitchell.
You are voting to vote them out

605
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,677
of the tribe.
All rules stay the same, but you

606
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,263
have to vote for one of the two.
Jerri.

607
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,150
>> JERRI: Mitchell, I promised
you from the very beginning of

608
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,277
this game that I would not vote
for you, and I am staying true

609
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:15,329
to that promise.
>> TINA: This game isn't easy.

610
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:32,847
to that promise.
>> TINA: This game isn't easy.

611
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,558
I didn't come out here to starve
myself and to face the elements

612
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:47,903
to keep the weakest person.
>> JEFF: I'll read the tie-

613
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:55,244
breaker votes.
Keith.

614
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:07,673
Mitchell.
Mitchell.

615
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:21,729
We have another tie.
It seems we're deadlocked.

616
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,733
In the<i> Survivor</i> rules, in a
deadlock, you go to votes cast

617
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:32,114
in previous Tribal Councils.
The tribe member with the most

618
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,075
votes is the person voted out.
How many votes have you had cast

619
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,411
against you, Keith?
>> KEITH: None.

620
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,079
>> JEFF: Mitchell?
>> MITCHELL: One.

621
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,374
>> JEFF: One.
One vote is the difference.

622
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,376
I need you to bring me your
torch.

623
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:57,723
>> MITCHELL: Okay.
>> JEFF: It's been a long vote,

624
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,725
Mitchell.
The tribe has spoken.

625
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:14,740
It's time for you to go.
Well, I have a feeling that

626
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:15,824
tonight's Tribal Council is
going to have a monumental

627
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:19,245
effect on this tribe.

633
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,939
check them at the door and let's
get down to business.

634
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:47,856
It is going to be one hell of a

took me by surprise.

641
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,627
Well, I guess the bright side
is, I get to eat, and I need to

642
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:12,339
eat.
Look at me...

643
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,718
I feel a little bit betrayed by
some of them, but at the same

644
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,804
time, I want to shake their
hands and congratulate them for

645
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:22,808
pulling the wool over my eyes
because they definitely got me.
