00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,255
<i>Shii Ann's eating habits didn't</i>

<i>She's</i>

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,843
repulsive.

SHII ANN:<i> Culturally, it's not</i>

<i>In Taiwan,</i>

8

PROBST:<i> At Chuay Gahn,</i>
<i>Brian and Ted made a pact.</i>

11
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,939
One of the things we...
we've got to kind of do is

12
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,190
have each other's back.

-What?!

19
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,620
<i>What do you mean</i>

20
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,664
we lost the boat?! (groans)

CLAY:<i> If we don't find</i>

22
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,792

23
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,420

25

29

00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,907

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,243
<i>you do get further</i>

36
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,036
we're all here
for a million dollars.

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,124
ERIN: Time to separate reality
from the game out here.

38
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,626
ROBB: Yeah, it is. I'm having
a little trouble with it.

39
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,795
'Cause I don't want to...
I don't want to base my opinions

40
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,882

this, and I know I'm going to.

PENNY:
<i>This morning when I got up,</i>

42
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,096
<i>Robb said, "Penny,</i>
<i>let me ask you a question."</i>

43
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,557
He said, "Were you ever planning
on voting me out last night?"

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,768
And I said, "Absolutely not,
100% never was I going

45
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,186
to write your
name down last night."

46
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,607
<i>And he said, "Well, you know,</i>
<i>that's kind of funny because</i>

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,944
<i>Ken said that you were going to</i>
<i>vote for me or for Stephanie."</i>

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,489
I don't know how much truth
is being said, you know.

49
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,742
There's no reason to lie to me.

50
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,703
I don't like
backstabbing bull ...

51
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,289
PENNY:<i> So I think Robb</i>
<i>got very upset this morning</i>

52
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,291
<i>thinking that maybe Ken</i>

53
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,084
is playing two different sides.

54
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,086
ROBB:
Now I don't trust anybody,

55
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,922
and Penny is telling me
one thing.

56
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,965
So I'm not playing any games
here, bro,

57
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,801
and I told you I've been
straight up with you,

58
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,803
so obviously... I don't know.

59
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,681
I don't know when you guys were
talking, or I don't even...

60
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,351
I don't even care. To be
honest with you, I don't care.

61
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,895
<i>I was questioning Ken's trust</i>
<i>and Ken's loyalty.</i>

62
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,272
<i>I didn't know if he was trying</i>
<i>to mix everything up, and</i>

63
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,982
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what he was trying to achieve.</i>

64
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,443
So, I confronted him on it.

65
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,986
You know what's bothering me?
Straight up, I think

66
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,488
you're playing a harder game
than anyone here.

67
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,405
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, I do.

68
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,990
Okay, so now,
yesterday going in there,

69
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,117
who did everybody else tell you
to vote for?

70
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,827
-Shii Ann.
-Oh, okay.

71
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,996
-Who did everybody vote for?
-Steph.

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,290
Okay, who did I tell you I was
voting for?

73
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,000
Steph. Who did I vote for?
Steph.

74
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,794
And now you got a problem
with me

75
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,170
because I was honest with you?

76
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,172
Yeah, I don't want
to ... hear it, okay?

77
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,633
<i>I have no idea what</i>
<i>started that. I didn't know</i>

78
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,635
<i>for the first five minutes</i>
<i>that it was even</i>

79
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,719
<i>directed towards me.</i>

80
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,887
And once I realized

81
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,514
it was directed towards me,
I thought he was kidding.

82
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,349
What you just got finished doing
is saying,

83
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,559
"You were the only one that was
honest with me yesterday.

84
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,103
You're playing a harder game
than everybody."

85
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,354
Well, you know what?

86
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,855
Don't ask me.
That pisses me off.

87
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,857
I wasn't ... like that.
I don't ... act like that, dude.

88
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,858
All right?
I'm not a little ... punk.

89
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,360
KEN: That's what you were acting
like last night.

90
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,194
Today I don't know... even know

91
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,112
what the hell
you're talking about.

92
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,197
-I... -Hey, give me
a straight answer.

93
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,658
On the first vote, it was
between me and Jed, right?

94
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,034
KEN:
You're damn straight it was.

95
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,662
-You're damn ... right it was.
-Really?

96
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,080
-According to who?
-According to everybody.

97
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,165
They couldn't st... You were
annoying the ... out of

98
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,458
everybody, because
you wouldn't shut up,

99
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,543
you kept on running
your mouth.

100
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,378
I think I already told you this.
But you know what?

101
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,587
I'm probably lying, right?

102
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,714
You told me
if you heard anything,

103
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,675
you were going to say it to me,
and you didn't tell me.

104
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,218
That was a week and a half ago.
I don't know what the hell

105
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,386
you're bringing that up now for.

106
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,556
Bro, because trust is
instilled early, and if it's...

107
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,391
... up early,
then it's ... up forever.

108
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,227
I-I just think you got some set
of balls

109
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,062
to approach me with this.

110
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,273
I'm the only person that's been
straight with you, and you just

111
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,233
bit the ... hand that's been
trying to feed you. I-I...

112
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:18,526
You obviously heard something
about me before the first

113
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,945
Tribal Council that we had to go
to. You didn't say a word to me

114
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,196
-about it. -Okay, you should
have addressed it back then.

115

-Don't wait a... -That was the
whole basis of my argument.

-Okay, well... -It's me thinking
that you're not being truthful.

117
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,119
So don't ... try to tell me that
I'm doing something I'm not.

118
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,245
-Hey, well, then, why didn't you
ask me? -All right?

119
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,456
-'Cause I'm not ... stupid.
-Why didn't you ask me?

120
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,874
Whatever.

<i>over there, but, you know,</i>

165
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,646
<i>Brian's a good swimmer,</i>

166
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,356
but even good swimmers get
into trouble.

167
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,860
<i>The other two are not even what</i>
<i>I would classify as swimmers.</i>

168
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,653
<i>Um, Clay did take</i>
<i>a float with him,</i>

169
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,488
and Ted was just
out there on his own.

170
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,032
BRIAN: He didn't know
where he was going.

171
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,285
-CLAY: Ted!
-TED: Yo!

172
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,870
-CLAY: It's this way!
-BRIAN: This way. -TED: Oh.

173
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,830
My bad.

174
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,040
I didn't realize I was swimming
in the wrong direction.

175
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,585
Keep doing the breast stroke.
Breast stroke for it here.

176
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,671
This is the most swimming
I've ever done in my life.

177
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,256
And each day,

178
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,593
my skills are getting better and
better and better and better.

179
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,679
I'm just at whale speed.
Whale speed.

180
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,056
CLAY: <i>The harder we'd swim,</i>
<i>it just</i>

181
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,474
<i>seemed like, uh, we weren't</i>
<i>going anywhere.</i>

182
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,935
<i>The island was getting further</i>
<i>away, or staying right there.</i>

183
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,228
<i>We wasn't leaving this beach,</i>

184
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,230
<i>and I got about halfway there,</i>
<i>and I thought, "Man!</i>

185
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:06,027
I'm not too sure I'm too proud
I decided to come do this."

186
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,321
-CLAY: Can you stand up?
-TED: Yeah.

187
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,239
Got any rocks or anything?

188
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,074
There is a cove down this way.

189
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,035
CLAY:
We'll never see this ... again,

190
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,787
but if I ever do, I'm going to
have a hamburger in my backpack.

191
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,955
-BRIAN: Uh-huh.
-(Ted laughs)

192
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,707
CLAY:
<i>And then, you know,</i>

193
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,918
<i>you're there, you're only</i>
<i>halfway through, 'cause you got</i>

194
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,419
<i>to turn around and come back.</i>

195
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,421
<i>Oh, man, if I'd had</i>
<i>a little bitty pillow,</i>

196
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,632
I'd lay down on that island
and stayed right there.

197
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,886
BRIAN:<i> I just swam ahead</i>
<i>to try to find out if there's</i>

198
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,888
<i>another beach around</i>
<i>the actual point of the island</i>

199
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,223
<i>to see if I could</i>
<i>find a boat.</i>

200
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,432
No boat in sight anywhere.

201
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:40,061
Well, we covered everything
that we could possibly cover.

202
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,605
I think the boat
is halfway to Malaysia.

203
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,690
BRIAN:
I think so, too.

204
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,404
CLAY:<i> It's not here. Far as</i>
<i>I know, it's not in this whole</i>

205
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,114
side of the world.
It's-It's gone.

206
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,119
<i>I don't think anybody wants</i>

207
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,205
to talk about
that boat no more.

208
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,507
(chickens clucking)

209
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,560
ROBB:
I'm starving, bro.

210
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,646
KEN:
So?

211
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,652
Right there is a good one.

212
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,321
Dude, just relax.

213
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,364
I'm over it.

214
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,657
KEN:
Unbelievable.

215
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,951
(laughs)

216
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,329
KEN:<i> We had all agreed</i>
<i>to not touch the bananas,</i>

217
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,330
<i>wait till they get ripe,</i>

218
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,790
<i>because Robb's</i>
<i>capable of eating</i>

219
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,375
30 bananas a day, Penny's not,

220
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,335
so we're going to do it
in a fair manner.

221
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,837
KEN: What's the deal?
Are we eating the bananas?

222
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,630
Are we not eating the bananas?
How's this work?

223
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,673
PENNY:
I don't know.

224
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,966
We're waiting on the bananas.

225
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,968
KEN: Well, Robb's in there, he's
in there digging for bananas.

226
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,052
(mutters):
I don't know

227
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,680
ROBB:<i> I was hungry,</i>
<i>so I had a banana.</i>

228
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,182
<i>I don't think anyone wants</i>
<i>to have to ask somebody</i>

229
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,350
<i>if they can have a banana.</i>

230
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,352
<i>We want them,</i>
<i>we're going to enjoy them.</i>

231
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,062
We worked really hard
for that food,

232
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,731
<i>but Ken just took it</i>
<i>upon himself</i>

233
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,899
<i>to be the policeman out here.</i>

234
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,193
So what is this,
a free-for-all on the bananas?

235
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,154
-Is that how we're doing it?
-ROBB: Yeah, I'm talking about,

236
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,405
when we're hungry, eat a banana.

237
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,532
People are going to be hungry,
they're going to eat a banana.

238
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,742
It's not like
I'm gonna walk around

239
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,909
with four bananas in my hand

240
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,952
and sit down and eat
all four of them.

241
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,371
Are we just eating
the bananas whenever, then?

242
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,165
All I know is that we worked
hard for those bananas.

243
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,291
If we're going to eat them,
we're going to eat them.

244
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,542
SHII ANN: Dude, I'm not
complaining about that, but you

245
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,585
-just grabbed another banana.
-Okay, I don't want to argue

246
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,879
over a banana. I'm hungry,
I'm gonna eat a banana.

247
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,213
I don't even want
to hear the word.

248
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,382
I'm not trying to squabble
about the bananas,

249
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,884
-but, like, we're just trying...
-All right, well, then shut up.

250
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,135
...I'm just trying to
figure out what the system is.

251
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,220
SHII ANN:
That's such bull ...

252
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,182
He's eaten, like, more bananas
than everybody else here.

253
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,434
PENNY:<i> Shii Ann started</i>
<i>to get in the middle of it,</i>

254
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,020
<i>and I said,</i>
<i>"Shii Ann, stay out of it.</i>

255
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,229
<i>"We don't need you involved.</i>

256
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,441
We need to stay focused, let
the two of them figure it out."

257
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:55,071
<i>But why they continue to act</i>
<i>like children, I'm not</i>

258
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,281
<i>really sure, but I think</i>
<i>we all need to leave them</i>

259
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,409
alone, really, and let the two
of them work it out.

260
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,096
PROBST:
Come on in, guys.

261
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,225
All right, for today's reward
challenge, we've combined

262
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,435
elements of a very popular
Thai game,

263
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,980
using wicker balls and baskets,
to create our own unique

264
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,483
<i>Survivor</i> reward challenge.
Here's how it works.

265
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,151
Each tribe will select
one member

266
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,946
to be their ball launcher.
The other four members

267
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,116
will be out at four stations
in the beach,

268
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,784
and you'll each be paired up
with somebody

269
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,744
from the other tribe.
Your job--

270
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,122
using wicker baskets,
catch the balls being launched

271
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,915
by your ball launcher.

272
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,667
Every time you catch one,
you score a point.

273
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,253
At the same time,
you're trying to stop

274
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,880
the other tribe
from catching their ball.

275
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,799
Each tribe may call
one timeout.

276
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,176
During a timeout,
you can strategize.

277
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,011
You can also swap positions.

278
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,597
First tribe to catch five
wicker balls wins reward.

279
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,266
Want to know
what you're playing for?

280
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,475
-Yeah.
-PROBST: Number one,

281
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,436
get you away from your beach
for a while.

282
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,273
Number two, you get a chance
to experience Thai culture,

283
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,151
and number three, you get
to indulge in a massive feast.

284
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,694
(people gasping and sighing)

285
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,531
Here's just a sample of the many
delicacies you'll be eating.

286
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,992
A little fresh pineapple stuffed
with rice and cashews,

287
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,493
prawns the size of your fist,

288
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,163
and a little bit of wine
to toast your victory.

289
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,331
You're going to come back
very full,

290
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,125
and hopefully,
in a good frame of mind.

291
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,210
Okay, Sook Jai, because you have
one extra member,

292
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,378
you're sitting
one person out.

293
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,588
Shii Ann, it's going to be you.
The rest

294
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,048
of the tribes, figure out
your strategy, wait for my go.

295
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,718
-Turn around, 'cause they're
coming back at you. -Right.

296
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,803
-Sook Jai!
-Chuay Gahn!

297

298
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,896
Great reward at stake.

305
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,952
Nice job, Robb.

306
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,829
Yeah!

307

Yeah, Robb! Whoo!

314
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:35,648
Yeah!

315
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,399
Robb with his third goal.

316
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,568
Sook Jai-- three,
Chuay Gahn-- one.

317
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,903
-Yeah!
-SHII ANN: Sook Jai!

318
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,571
Helen, play it right.

319
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,531
CLAY:
No, we shoot them this way,

320
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,367
not way off out there
in the damn cliffs.

321
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,576
Hell.

322
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,246

323

00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,254
Nice effort, guys.

325
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,588
No score, though.

326
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,882
Helen, hit Brian.

327
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,926
You just told me to hit Clay!

328
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,763
PROBST:
Ready, aim, fire!

329
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,145

00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,889
that it's going to happen
in the next three days.

498
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,558
It could,
I wouldn't be surprised,

499
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,059
but I guarantee you
it will happen

500
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,811
before two more immunities.

501
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,896
TED:
<i>We need the immunity badly.</i>

502
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,775
<i>Right now Sook Jai is up six</i>
<i>members; we have five members.</i>

503
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,902
<i>If we can win immunity</i>
<i>one more time,</i>

504
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,904
<i>then they have</i>
<i>to come down to five</i>

505
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,197
and then it's just going
to almost be

506
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,657
like starting all over again.

507
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,744
(sighs)

508
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,745
We still in play?

509
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,746
Yeah, of course.

510
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,164
Okay, cool.

511
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,751
(both laugh)

512
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,086
BRIAN:<i> Ted and I have still</i>
<i>a very strong relationship.</i>

513
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,588
We have a certain lingo that,
when we talk about,

514
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,423
we both know
exactly where our head's at.

515
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,884
Yeah, when the merge comes, man,
it's gonna be important

516
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,303
-for all of us to kind of
stay together. -Yeah.

517
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,221
-I know exactly
where your head's at. -Cool.

518
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,099
BRIAN:<i> All we really want</i>
<i>to do is just kind of be</i>

519
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,309
<i>very low-keyed.</i>

520
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,477
<i>No one needs to know</i>
<i>of our strong friendship,</i>

521
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,939
and we're kind of just seeing
if anybody's playing us.

522
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,400
I think Clay is trying
to figure us out.

523
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,693
I think so.

524
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,905
We'll just see what happens when
that situation comes into play.

525
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,907
-I'm gonna play it down, man,
I'm gonna play... -Of course.

526
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,450
-"I don't know what you're
talking about." -Yeah.

527
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,036
Watch your back.

528
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,622
TED:<i> Clay doesn't know</i>

our game plan

535
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,029
KEN: How big were
those prawns yesterday?

536
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,155
ROBB:
Oh, my God, dude, I...

537
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,825
I can't wait to eat
some more Thai food like that.

538
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,826
It's never going
to be that pretty

539
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,035
or in that same place, though.

540
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,331
ROBB:<i> That amazing meal</i>
<i>yesterday, eating on the beach,</i>

541
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,625
<i>and watching the Thai dancers</i>
<i>and the guys play the music--</i>

542
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,335
it was amazing.

543
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,171

544
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,006

546
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,343
<i>but I think I can appreciate it</i>
<i>a little bit more.</i>

547
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,929
Look at this-- snakeskin.

548
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,140
Whatever it shed it's small,
though-- look at it--

549
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,267
unless this is the very tip
of its tail.

550
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,189
<i>Today Ken and I took a walk</i>
<i>into the jungle and walked back</i>

551
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,275
further than I've been
since I've been here.

552
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,404
KEN:
This is nice.

553
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,532
ROBB:
Cool, dude.

554
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,659
KEN: I didn't realize
it went back like that.

555
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,869
ROBB:
Look at this.

556
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,829
-(bat squeaks)
-KEN: If you freak them out,

557
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,872
they're all going to fly out.

558
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,873
Dude, it's huge.

559
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,249
(bat squeaks)

560
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,209
ROBB:
<i>When we walked in the cave,</i>

561
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,170
<i>there's bats flying</i>
<i>all over the place inside,</i>

562
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,379
<i>and I-I walked back kind of far</i>

563
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,505
in there and looked back.

564
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,673
There are so many back in here.

565
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,674
KEN:
I know there are.

566
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,676
Holy ..., dude, look at this.

567
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,719
Robb, be careful.

568
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,887
-(whispers): Come on, man.
-Don't start screaming.

569
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,222
ROBB:<i> It's just amazing,</i>
<i>to be able to walk</i>

570
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,390
and find such a beautiful place

571
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,641
that we've been taking
for granted.

572
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,728
I never would have thought that
I'd be sitting here in a cave

573
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,396
in the middle
of a jungle in Thailand,

574
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,733
savoring one banana
and a canteen full of water

575
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,776
that's warm as piss
and tastes even worse.

576
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,737
<i>I did so much thinking about,</i>

577
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,239
<i>I'll never be here</i>
<i>again in my life,</i>

578
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,700
and it just puts everything
in perspective that much more.

579
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,870
Ken and I really squashed
the beef and really had, I mean,

580
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,246
<i>an amazing enough conversation</i>

581
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,457
<i>that he made me</i>
<i>make sense to myself,</i>

582
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,917
and not many people
have done that.

583
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,419
Listen, it's like you're always

584
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,254
-trying to tell me what to do.
-Well, you know what?

585
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,423
Maybe you should listen when
somebody is trying to help you,

586
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,091
because that's all
I've been trying to do

587
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,259
since you've been here.

588
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,260
And you know what?

589
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,221
It's getting harder
and harder to help you.

590
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,765
<i>Robb and I really don't have</i>
<i>too many differences.</i>

591
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,059
<i>It's just that he's</i>
<i>a young kid, he just needs...</i>

592
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,894
That's why I took him out there
today-- to talk to him,

593
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,270
that's it, you know,
just get his head straight

594
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,772
because I know he's not doing
too well out here.

595
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,732
ROBB:
Hey, for real, though,

596
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,984
I really appreciate
you talking to me, Ken.

597
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,819
Now that we go back,
you're feeling a lot better,

598
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,780
and then
everybody gets along well.

599
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,740
-ROBB: Amen.
<i>-We definitely made peace.</i>

600
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,450
<i>It was good.</i>

601
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,245
I guess it was like hanging out
with an older brother.

602
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,962
JAN:<i> Helen, we have</i>
<i>to have a funeral.</i>

603
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:47,921
HELEN:
Why?

604
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,257
I found a baby bat.

605
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,008
-Aw...
-And it's dead.

606
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,011
I have it hidden
so y'all can see it,

607
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,430
and we're going to bury it
with a cross.

608
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,015
HELEN:<i> Jan was all upset</i>
<i>'cause she found</i>

609
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,685
<i>this, uh-- really, I would</i>

610
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,105
not even call it a baby bat yet;
it was still embryonic stage--

611
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,274
um, slimy, little
baby bat thing.

612
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,150
Oh, God.

613
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,277
See?

614
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,653
-That's its head there.
-Tiny, tiny.

615
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,282
-Yes, there's
its little bat arms. -Man.

616
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,450
HELEN:
<i>I feel bad if a kitten dies,</i>

617
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,286
<i>but I'm looking</i>
<i>at this slimy bat, going,</i>

618
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,788
"Uh, yeah, okay, that's real
sad," you know?

619
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,040
"Bury that thing

the funeral, right?

621
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,003
-JAN: Yes. -TED: Okay.
-HELEN: You're invited, Ted.

622
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,672
I'll send a card
and some flowers.

623
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,675
BRIAN:
<i>She wanted to have a funeral,</i>

624
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,428
<i>and named it Oscar,</i>
<i>and was quite sad</i>

625
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,763
<i>about the little bat</i>
<i>that I was curious</i>

626
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,681
if we could eat it or not--

627
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,308
that was my first words
out of my mouth.

628
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,184
JAN:
Oh, poor baby.

629
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,520
Didn't have a chance,
did you, baby?

630
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,689
BRIAN:
<i>But again, I don't know</i>

631
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,525
<i>if that's just</i>
<i>Jan being emotional or if, uh,</i>

632
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,235
she's actually losing it
a little bit out here.

633
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,697
JAN:
<i>I know it's silly, but</i>

634
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,200
I feel sorry for him,
so I buried him and he's happy.

635
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,120
(laughs) And I'll quit crying
in a minute.

636
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,831
But I'm very sensitive, so--
especially about little animals

637
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,584
that are-- don't have a chance.

638

Here you go.

00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,550
-Treemail.
-It's ensconced in the mailbox.

640
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,634
Got treemail.

00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,558
-(laughs)
-PROBST: Immunity--

663
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,978
the most coveted prize in
this game-- back up for grabs.

664
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,940
To win it, you simply have
to outsmart the other tribe.

665
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,566
Today's challenge is all mental.

666
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,443
It's called Thai 21.

667
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,653
Here's how it works.

668
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,988
There are 21 flags
in this circle.

669
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,368
Your goal-- be the tribe
to get the last flag.

670
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,286
Here's the twist-- on each move,

671
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,290
you can only grab
one, two, or three flags,

672
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,460
so clearly the strategy lies
in determining

673
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:36,172
how many flags to grab
and when to grab them.

674
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,966
Sook Jai, because you have
one extra member,

675
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:38,967
you're sitting somebody out.

676
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,761
-Robb, plant it on the big rock.
-(Robb mutters)

677
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,305
Guys, take a seat on your
benches, start strategizing.

678
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,391
-Wait for my go.
-ERIN: And we can take two.

679
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,684
-We can take two and we win.
-We, we want

680
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,810
-the last flag.
-You understand?

681
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,312
At the end, we want to make sure
there's four flags.

682
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,689
-CLAY: Five or four?
-Five. -No, four.

683
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,649
PROBST:
Here we go, guys.

684
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,735
Sook Jai, you won the coin toss,
you elected to go first.

685
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,820
Make your first move.

686
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,531
You must grab one, two,
or three flags.

687
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,284
Sook Jai electing to grab two.

688
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,502
Sook Jai takes two flags on
their first move, leaving 19.

689
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,129
Chuay Gahn, make your move.

690
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,468
Chuay Gahn also takes two.

691
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,638
Very simple game
with huge consequences.

692
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,142
After one round,
we're down to 17 flags.

693
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,144
Sook Jai, make your move.

694
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,024
Sook Jai takes two more flags,
leaving 15.

695
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,192
Chuay Gahn, make your move.

696
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,027
I hope that's right.

697
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,696
PROBST:
Chuay Gahn takes one.

698
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,698
We're down to 14 flags.

699
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,492
Sook Jai, your move.

700
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,494
Penny takes one.

701
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,081
Chuay Gahn also takes one.

702
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,042
We are down to 12 flags.

703
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,210
I have a better feeling
about, though, staying

704
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,377
-on odds.
-She wants to take one.

705
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,171
-TED: We have two more...
-CLAY: I know, but you take

706
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,298
the three away, that's nine.

707
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,508
Sook Jai, it is your move.

708
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,717
Make it.

709
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,725
We're now down to 11 flags.

710
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:13,353
Chuay Gahn, your move.

711
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,069
We are now down to nine flags.

712
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,737
Immunity at stake.

713
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,657
Your moves are becoming
very critical.

714
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,034
You guys have to help me think,
you've got to help me think.

715
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,077
Sook Jai, it is your move.

716
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,078
Make it.

717
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,120
How many?

718
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,581
I don't know, you guys,
this is... I don't know.

719
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,832
So I think we're looking good.

720
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,751
We just got to see what they
take and take the same amount.

721
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,253
Take three, there's six.

722
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,088
And they could take one.

723
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,422
Got to make a move, guys.

724
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,800
One, two, or three flags.

725
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,927
Let's go.

726
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,220
HELEN: They're going,
they're going three,

727
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,388
they're going three.

728
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,807
PROBST:
Sook Jai takes three.

729
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,774
There are six flags remaining.

730
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,776
Chuay Gahn, it's your move.

731
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:02,819
What y'all want to do?

732
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,280
-If they take two,
we would-- we'd lose. -We lose?

733
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,115
Yeah, if they take two, we lose.

734
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,576
-Take one.
-Hey, listen, we just take one.

735
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,785
That's an awful long time
to think about it.

736
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,453
We have
to go pick up two flags.

737
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,163
-We have to pick up two.
-We have to pick up two.

738
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,206
-Yes.
-Shh. Shh!

739
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,583
Let's go.

740
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,918
Want to do it? Let's go, buddy.

741
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,797
-They're taking two? -We lost.
-We lost, we lost it.

742
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,215
SHII ANN:
We lost.

743
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,511
JAKE:
They won it.

744
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,097
That sucks.

745
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,641
That move will clinch it.

746
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,311
Sook Jai, make your last move.

747
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,437
Play this game out.

748
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,982
Making a very classy move
in grabbing three flags.

749
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,483
Good job.

750
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,693
Thanks.

751
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,281
Chuay Gahn, nicely played.

752
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,282
Grab your last flag.

753
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,373
Everyone, put your hand on it.

754
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,292
Let's go,
let's take it back together.

755
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,713
Chuay Gahn wins immunity.

756
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,553
Way to go, way to go, way to go.

757
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,846
PROBST: Back-to-back immunity,
Chuay Gahn.

758
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,848
Nicely done, well played.

759
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,724
Hey!

760
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,516
-Have a good night.
-TED: Great job.

761
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,517
-Great job, you guys.
-Sook Jai,

762
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,980
just another reminder
of how one wrong move,

763
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:21,981
and you're out of the game.

764
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,566
One of you will be.

765
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,027
I'll see you tomorrow night
at Tribal Council.

766
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,654
You can head back to camp.

767
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,722
JAKE:
<i>We lost the immunity challenge.</i>

768
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,890
<i>Everybody is really</i>

769
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,726
bummed out about that, 'cause we
really wanted to win it.

770
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,895
(murmuring indistinctly)

771
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,231
This is the first,
first time I've been upset

772
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,732
about any challenge we've lost.

773
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,942
This was important.

774
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,486
Yeah, it was.

775
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,488
JAKE: Do we dig out the wine
and talk about it?

776
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,532
ERIN:
<i>We decided to open up</i>

777
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,743
<i>our wine that we had</i>
<i>from our food reward...</i>

778
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,953
We got a lot of wine left.

779
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,122
<i>...and just kind of came</i>
<i>to grips with the fact</i>

780
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,790
that we were going to have
to get rid of someone.

781
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,999
(blows)

782
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,544
ROBB: This is our last night
together as a family, guys,

783
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,129
the six of us.

784
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,880
-KEN: That sucks.
-Yeah, it doesn't feel

785
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:28,798
good, that's for sure.

786
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,050
This is a game of up and downs,
isn't it?

787
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,637
I mean, up one minute,
totally down the next.

788
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,806
ROBB: You know what, man?
It's all positive.

789
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,891
There's no words that can
describe this experience.

790
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,435
When it's all said and done,

791
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,145
you know what I'm gonna
tell people about this?

792
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:46,315
You know, it changed my whole
outlook on life in two weeks.

793
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,817
ERIN:
<i>Everyone just kind of sat down</i>

794
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,068
<i>and poured out their feelings,</i>

795
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,404
<i>which is something</i>
<i>that we really haven't done,</i>

796
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,073
<i>but Robb talked about,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

797
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,450
what he's learned by being here

798
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,660
and it-it really made
all of us think.

799
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,911
ROBB: You know,
before I left, you know

800
00:33:58,995 --> 00:33:59,954
what I thought was
important to me?

801
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,581
How much money I made a week

802
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,750
and getting wasted...

803
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,628
and within, like, five nights
in here, I started really,

804
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,339
like... starting to think
about things, man.

805
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,925
Life is so important
right now to me,

806
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,636
and family, you guys, is the
most important thing in life.

807
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,806
The people you love, the people
who love you just as much--

808
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,600
that's what this is about.

809
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,684
You guys do not understand.

810
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,479
I didn't have a relationship
with my dad for 21 years

811
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,148
of my life, and now I miss him
more than I miss anyone.

812
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,483
I want to go home and tell him

813
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,026
how much I love him,
and that's what I'm gonna

814
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,069
take away from this,
no matter what happens.

815
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,614
I'm already going home a winner.

816
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,450
JAKE:
<i>I love people,</i>

817
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,161
<i>and I like to see people make</i>
<i>breakthroughs</i>

818
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,331
<i>in their own lives,</i>
<i>like I know Robb had.</i>

819
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,999
I think it'll be
meaningful for him

820
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,959
for the rest of his life.

821
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,128
ROBB: I never imagined
I'd get out here

822
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,632
and really warm up
to cherishing bananas.

823
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,716
-(laughs)
-You know what I mean?

824
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,968
KEN: I'll tell you one thing
that I never imagined--

825
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,846
that I'd be hanging out
with a skateboarder freak.

826
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,473
(laughter)

827
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,683
I tell you what,
you're a good man.

828
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,684
I like you.

829
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,560
ROBB:
Amen, bro.

830
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,020
SHII ANN:
Can I just say something?

831
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,146
You and I have had
our differences,

832
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,190
Robb, but I think you're

833
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,025
a really, really good guy.

834
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,860
-I appreciate that.
-I just want you to know that.

835
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,238
-Thank you, thank you very much.
-Okay?

836
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,704

SHII ANN:
<i>We had a great time last night.</i>

838
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,715
A lot of words were said
that were never said before,

839
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,717
so it's kind of,

840
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,388
it's kind of sappy but
really sweet at the same time.

841
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,014
It's a shame,
but that's the way it is.

842
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,684
SHII ANN:
<i>But is it a love fest?</i>

843
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,853
<i>Is it a love tribe?</i>
<i>I don't think so.</i>

844
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,063
We love you, chicken.
Thanks for giving your ultimate

845
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,273
-for us.

SHII ANN:<i> I think it was</i>
<i>a little alcohol,</i>

847
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,905

848
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,782

<i>the politics here.</i>

849
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,701
I don't think
that Penny and Erin trust me

850
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,369
one bit more than I trust them.

851
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,206
<i>This is a game,</i>
<i>and strategically we are</i>

852
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,917
still divided.

853
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,919
PENNY:
Hey, y'all, we're ready to eat.

854
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,423
-(Jake grunts)
-It's so freaking hot.

855
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,425
SHII ANN:
It's really hot.

856
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,928
JAKE:<i> Voting at Tribal Council</i>
<i>is terribly painful for me.</i>

857
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,263
<i>Just like this morning,</i>

858
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,932
<i>I didn't want to kill</i>
<i>that chicken, but I knew that</i>

859
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,809
<i>it's just one of those things</i>
<i>that we know</i>

860
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,520
<i>we have to do, and as painful</i>

861
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,939
as it is, somebody has to go.

862
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,794
Hello, guys.

863
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,465
Well, another interesting three
days in the life of Sook Jai.

864
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,344
A great win, a tough loss,
and here you are again.

865
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,429
Erin, tell me what's your take

866
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,805
on the last three days?

867
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,265
The last three days

868
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,309
have been the most tumultuous
that we've had

869
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,644
since we've been here.

870
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,146
We had our very best night
that we've ever had

871
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,190
when we won the feast,

872
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:18,861
and then the very next night
we lost our immunity, and, uh,

873
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:23,824
it really touched all of us,
I guess, in a...

874
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,660
in a really kind
of emotional way,

875
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,287
so we've, we've all had
a really tough time with it.

876
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,413
PROBST:
So, Penny,

877
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,458
you go back to camp after losing
the immunity challenge,

878
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,835
and the tone completely changes.

879
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,170
Why was this different?

880
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,923
Of all the games we played
the last 18 days,

881
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,843
I think this one was the one
we really wanted to win,

882
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,012
uh, just to keep
the six of us here

883
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,681
for three more nights together.

884
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,183
Robb, tell me about the night
through your eyes.

885
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,017
It was... it was kind of hard,

886
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,686
'cause for me sitting
on the sidelines

887
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,354
and watching them,
watching them lose

888
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,356
and then seeing
their reaction afterwards,

889
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,358
it was tough, you know?

890
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,734
And I started thinking
how thankful I was

891
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,695
to be here and, uh,

892
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,531
how amazing this experience has
been for me, absolutely amazing,

893
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,782
so I thought
I'd share it with them

894
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,576
and try to uplift
everyone's spirits, and

895
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,869
the reaction I got out of them

896
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,038
was a lot more
than I was hoping for.

897
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,208
Some people tucked away
some tears, and

898
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:18,004
all of us just-- I think
all of us just really felt it.

899
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,839
Well, I have to say, Sook Jai,

900
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,091
I am genuinely delighted

901
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,176
for the experience
you guys have had out here.

902
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,178
So, how in the heck are you guys

903
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,888
going to vote
somebody out tonight?

904
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,223
Shii Ann?

905
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,433
Um...

906
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:35,896
I think that tonight, uh,

907
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,482
is going to be really,
really hard, and

908
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,402
I can't speak for anyone else,
but I think that,

909
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:46,073
you know, the last two days
have been, um, kind of

910
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,784
so intimate
that it's going to be

911
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,245
a very difficult vote tonight.

912
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,329
PROBST:
Erin,

913
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,750
is there a different way
to put a spin on it, in that

914
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,084
they're both wins?

915
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,919
I get to play this amazing game,

916
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,922
which is all strategy,
and can be conniving,

917
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,759
and yet in the midst
of all of it, I'm having

918
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,844
a life-changing experience.

919
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,472
I think Robb helped all of us
to realize

920
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,265
what we've all actually gained

921
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,267
from the 18 days
that we've been here,

922
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,187
and it's a lot more
than any of us ever expected.

923
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,606
I think it really put us
at peace

924
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,401
with making the decision that
we have to vote for somebody.

925
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,029
Jake, in all the things that
have happened out here

926
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,783
in 18 days,
where does tonight's vote rank?

927
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,326
It's the worst.

928
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:34,246
It's a very, very difficult vote
for, I-I'm sure, for every

929
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,665
person in this room,
and I wish we didn't have to.

930
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:40,461
I'll never forget these last
few days with these six.

931
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,754
It is time to vote.

932
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,090
Penny, you're first.

933
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,946
There's an old proverb:

934
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,116
"A wise man knows much,
but says little.

935
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,993
A fool knows little,
but says far too much."

936
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,454
Robb, I was just beginning
to like you,

937
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,124
but unfortunately
you have to go.

938
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,043
Sorry, buddy, no hard feelings.

939
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,311
(sighs)

940
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,354
No hard feelings, baby.

941
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:41,564
I had to vote for somebody.

942
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,940
We had our ups and downs,

943
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,025
but, uh, I'm definitely glad
I got to know you.

944
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,162
I'll go tally the votes.

945
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,339
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

946
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,716
The person will be asked
to leave

947
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,384
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

948
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,886
I'll read the votes.

949
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,642
First vote-- Shii Ann.

950
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,023
Robb.

951
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,524
With two B's.

952
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,902
Two B's, guys.

953
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,615
Robb.

954
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,993
Robb.

955
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,287
That's three votes-- Robb,
one vote-- Shii Ann.

956
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,584
Robb.

957
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,753
That's four votes.
That's enough.

958
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,504
You need to bring me your torch.

959
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,972
Robb, the tribe has spoken.

960
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,057
Thanks, bro.

961
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:01,310
Much love, dude.

962
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,811
You guys rule.
Good luck.

963
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,855
Play hard, dude.

964
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,149

you guys are all with me.

969
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,961
you guys have experienced some
real spiritual growth, and yet

970
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,256
it sounds like the person
who inspired that growth

971
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,008
is the same person
you just voted out.

972
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,468
It's a great game, huh?

973
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:36,345
You guys can head back to camp.

974
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,013
