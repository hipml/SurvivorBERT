6
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,680
TIME, AND THIS TIME I WANT TO BE

7
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,180

STARTED ANY BETTER.

11
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,728
>> IN PARADISE.

12
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,812
>> WE GOT SOME FISH.

13
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,522
>> I WANT TO HAVE FUN OUT HERE.

00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,940
I WANT TO DO STUFF.

I JUST LOVE IT OUT HERE.

16
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,276
THIS IS GREAT.

>> Jeff: AT TA KEO...

18
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,113
>> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ME

19
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,072
BEHIND MY BACK.

20
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,073
>> Jeff: ABI AND PEIH-GEE

CONTINUED TO FIGHT, LEAVING ABI

22
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:34,325
ALL ALONE.

23
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,995
>> SHE'S GETTING LAUGHED AT BY

24
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:37,871
HER PEOPLE.

25
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,788
THERE'S ANOTHER HUMAN BEING OUT

26
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,874
THERE FLOUNDERING, THAT'S JUST

27
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:41,082
WRONG.

28
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,001
>> Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

>> Jeff: TA KEO LOST FOR THE

32
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,172

00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,308
FOUND THEMSELVES ON THE OUTS.

00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,726
>> EVERYTHING STARTED GOING

40
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,269
REALLY WELL, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

41
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,813
IT COLLAPSES IN FRONT OF ME.

42
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,523
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

>> THIS CHANGE WILL HAPPEN.

46
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,819
IT'S ABOUT FORMING

47
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,153
RELATIONSHIPS.

48
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,571
>> Jeff: IN THE END, SHIRIN

49
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,363
WAS SENT HOME.

50
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,239
18 ARE LEFT.

51
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:18,161
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

52

Captioning funded by CBS

53
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,339
REAL QUICK, I'M SO GRATEFUL TO

00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,549
BE HERE...YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

55
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,175
SEE ME RUNNING AROUNG HERE WITH

56
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,052
CRAZINESS.

57
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,261
I WANNA BE A STRONG TEAM.

58
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,180
I'M STILL NOT THE STRONGEST

59
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,391
SOCIAL PLAYER OUT HERE.

60
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,560
I'M COMPLETELY ON THE OUTS.

61
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,437
SO I HAVE TO CHANGE.

62
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,772
I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE FOR

63
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,857
ANOTHER COUPLE DAYS.

64
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,445
IN THIS SEASON, WHICH IS ABOUT

65
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,156
CHANGE, AND ABOUT SECOND CHANCE

66
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,326
OF YOU AS A SURVIVOR PLAYER & AS

67
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,869
A PERSON, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

68
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,704
BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE HAVE BEEN

69
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,330
REWARDED.

70
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,542
SO IF I CAN MAKE THE CHANGE I

71
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,252
KNOW IS WITHIN ME HAPPEN,

72
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,336
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY HOPE.

73
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,838
>> I'M JUST GLAD SHE'S GONE,

74
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,256
MAN.

75
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,633
>> ANY OF US MAKES IT TO THE

76
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,802
ACTUAL FINAL, THAT IS A FEATHER

77
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,386
IN YOUR CAP AS FAR AS WHAT YOU

78
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,887
DID TO GET RID OF ONE OF THE

79
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,597
MOST STRATEGIC PEOPLE I'VE EVER

80
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,683
MET ON "SURVIVOR."

81
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,852
I HAVE SIMPLY GONE FROM THE

82
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,188
BOTTOM UP TO THE TOP WITHOUT ANY

83
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,232
FEAR OF GETTING VOTED OUT.

84
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,859
>> IT'S PERFECT.

85
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,359
NOBODY'S ALIENATED.

86
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,736
EVERYBODY'S GOOD.

87
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,947
>> THE NUMBERS ARE ON OUR SIDE,

88
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,491
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN TERRY DIETZ

89
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,869
HAS THIS SOCIAL GAME.

90
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,704
I'M KIND OF PROUD OF MYSELF, YOU

91
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:42,912
KNOW?

92
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,413
IT WORKED OUT GREAT.

93
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,665
AND THERE'S STILL SPENCER TO

94
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,332
VOTE OUT AT THE NEXT TRIBAL IF

95
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,793
WE HAVE TO GO.

96
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,044
BOY, I'M ON TOP OF THE WORLD

97
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,462
RIGHT NOW.

98
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:59,721
LIFE IS GOOD.

99
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:10,732
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

100
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,609

>> Jeff: SHIRIN VOTED OUT AT

107
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:25,455

VARNER, DID GETTING RID OF

>> AFTER LAST NIGHT WE FEEL LIKE

118
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,971
WE GOT THE TEAM UNITY BACK.

119
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,972
TAKING ON THIS CHALLENGE TODAY,

00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,224
WE NEED IT FOR ADDITIONAL TEAM

121
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:45,475

SIDES ARE HAPPY WITH THE WAY

129
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,608
THINGS ARE GOING, WHICH MAKES IT

130
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,777
A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE

131

THIS SWITCH UNIQUE IS WE ARE

141
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,543
SWITCHING FROM TWO TRIBES TO

142
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,214
THREE TRIBES.

143
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,258
>> SHUT THE FROM THE DOOR.

144
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,218

SIX OF YOU WILL END UP ON THE

AND SIX OF YOU WILL GO TO A NEW

151
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,103
BEACH WHERE YOU WILL HAVE TO

152
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,147
START FROM SCRATCH.

153
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:33,731
YOU'LL HAVE THE SAME SUPPLIES

154
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,817
YOU HAD WHEN YOU BEGAN THIS

155
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,442
GAME, BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO BUILD

156
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,569
A NEW SHELTER.

157
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,571
>> OH, COME ON.

158
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,490
>> Jeff: SO, SAVAGE, WHAT IS

159
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,283
HAPPENING EMOTIONALLY RIGHT NOW

FOR YOU?

161
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,077
>> I'M SCARED.

162
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,619
I'M SCARED.

163
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,704
THERE'S SO MUCH LOVE ON THIS

164
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,287
TRIBE.

165
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,789
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY OVER.

166
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,456
THERE SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS

167
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,334
IS GOING TO PLAY OUT, BUT IT

168
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,419
SCARES THE CAP OUT OF ME.

169
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,629
>> WHEN JEFF SAID IT WAS A SWAP,

170
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,755
MY HEART STOPPED.

171
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,548
I HAVEN'T HAD THE BEST LUCK ON

172
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,925
"SURVIVOR" IN TERMS OF SWAPS AND

173
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,926
TWISTS.

174
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,511
I HAVE THE SAME KIND OF HAUNTING

175
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,888
FEAR I HAD 12 YEARS AGO.

176
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,684
I DON'T WANT TO SWAP.

177
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,185
>> Jeff: SHALL WE GET TO THE

178
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:11,394
DRAW?

179
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,311
>> YEAH.

180
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:12,937
>> OH, DEAR.

181
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,897
>> OH, MY GOD.

182
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,774
>> Jeff: HERE'S YOUR FATE

183
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,066
RIGHT HERE.

184
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,528
>> PURPLE.

185
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,572
>> Jeff: JEREMY GOING TO CLOSE

186
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,492
HIS EYES.

187
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,410
VARNER DOESN'T WANT TO LOOK.

188
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:33,207
NOBODY WANTS TO LOOK.

189
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:38,087
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY REVEAL.

190
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,172
>> HELL, YEAH.

191
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,340
HELL, YEAH.

192
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,676
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

193
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,469
>> Jeff: IF YOU'RE ON BAYON,

194
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,596
MOVE OVER TO THE BAYON MATT.

195
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,555
>> I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS

196
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,806
CAMP.

197
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,224
>> Jeff: IF YOU'RE TA KEO,

198
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:50,725
MOVE TO THE TA KEO MAP.

199
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,061
AND IF YOU HAVE YELLOW, YOU'RE

200
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:53,478
RIGHT IN THE CENTER.

201
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,813
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

202
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,522
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

203
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,150
SO WE HAVE OUR THREE TRIBES.

204
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,860
BAYON, SO FOUR OF THE ORIGINAL

205
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,196
BAYON MEMBERS ARE STILL

206
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:03,446
TOGETHER.

207
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,199
MONICA, JEREMY, FISHBACH AND

208
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:06,991
KIMMI.

209
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,826
AND WIGLESWORTH AND SPENCER FROM

210
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,244
TA KEO JOIN THEM.

211
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,538
THE NEW TA KEO TRIBE, FOUR

212
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,874
MEMBERS FROM THE BAYON TRIBE,

213
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,793
KEITH, KASS, JOE AND CIERA NOW

214
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,879
JOIN DIETZ AND WENTWORTH.

215
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,463
>> IT'S A DANGEROUS GAME GOING

216
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,049
INTO A MIX-UP, BUT LOOKING AT

217
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,842
THE TRIBES AS A WHOLE, OUR GIRLS

218
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,176
ARE STRONGER.

219
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,220
OUR GUYS ARE STRONGER.

220
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,013
WE'RE IN A REALLY, REALLY GOOD

221
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,849
SPOT TO TAKE CONTROL OF THIS

222
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,058
GAME.

223
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,812
>> Jeff: IN THE MIDDLE, YOUR

224
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,522
TRIBE NAME, ANGOR.

225
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,357
THE NEW ANGOR HAS FOUR PEOPLE

226
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,402
FROM THE OLD TA KEO TRIBE, LOU,

227
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,403
VARNER, PEIH-GEE AND ABI.

228
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,988
THEY'RE JOINED BY TASHA AND

229
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,697
SAVAGE.

230
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,990
SAVAGE, YOU WERE PRETTY HONEST

231
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,117
IN SAYING YOU WERE SCARED.

232
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,700
NOW YOU END UP ON A TRIBE THAT

233
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,536
HAS TO START OVER.

234
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,453
HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW?

235
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,455
>> OVERWHELMED.

236
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,667
IF THEY GO BY TRIBAL LINES, I'M

237
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,460
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE, AND WE HAVE

238
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,628
A COUPLE DAYS OF UNBELIEVABLY

239
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,422
HARD WORK AHEAD OF US.

240
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,175
I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT'S

241
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:06,717
DEVASTATING.

242
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,136
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

243
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:14,267
BAYON, ANGOR, TA KEO, GRAB YOUR

244
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,809
STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

245
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,519
>> I NEEDED SOME WAY TO GET OUT

246
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,729
OF THE SITUATION WHERE I WAS

247
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,480
PINNED ON THE BOTTOM, AND NOW

248
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,983
IT'S LIKE "SURVIVOR" GODS HAVE

249
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,776
LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, SPENCER,

250
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,279
YOU DO DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE,

251
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,655
HERE'S WHERE YOU WERE.

252
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:32,660
WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

253
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,583
>> HEY, TASHA.

254
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,627
>> WE HAVE NO FOOD.

255
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,046
>> WE HAVE NOTHING.

256
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,340
>> OH, MAN.

257
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:27,965
>> NOTHING.

258
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,217
NO BAMBOO.

259
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,885
>> THAT'S REALLY BUMMING ME OUT.

260
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:38,434
>> LET'S CHECK OUR LITTLE BOAT.

261
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:42,146
>> THAT DUDE IS GOING TO TO GET

262
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,481
A LOT OF --

263
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,565
>> DUDE, LET'S BE SMART.

264
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,151
LET'S STAY WITH OUR FOUR.

265
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,736
GET THESE GUYS OUT OF HERE.

266
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,111
PLEASE, PLEASE.

267
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,112
NOTHING CRAZY.

268
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,155
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

269
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,698
>> NO, NO.

270
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:52,865
NO.

271
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,616
>> IT'S HARD HAVING TO START

272
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,951
OVER.

273
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,620
NOT ONE SHRED OF FOOD, NO

274
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,121
BUILDING MATERIALS, BUT IT COULD

275
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,748
BE WORSE.

276
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,208
I COULD BE IN THE MINORITY OVER

277
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:02,416
HERE.

278
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,918
SO IT IS A LUXURY.

279
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,753
THAT'S THE ONLY LUXURY.

280
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,588
THE ONLY LUXURY WE HAVE IN THIS

281
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,673
NEW TRIBE IS THAT WE'VE GOT TWO

282
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,800
PEOPLE AHEAD OF YOU IN LINE TO

283
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,512
BE VOTED OFF.

284
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,137
WHERE DID THOSE TWO RUN OFF TO?

285
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,474
>> I'M NOT SURE.

286
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,475
>> OKAY.

287
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,435
HERE'S WHAT I THINK, HOPEFULLY A

288
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,770
COUPLE OF THEM ARE ON THE OUTS.

289
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,981
LET'S PROMISE THEM WE COME BACK

290
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,691
TOGETHER AND MERGE, WE CAN ALL

291
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,109
PLAY TOGETHER.

292
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,403
I AM IN THE MINORITY ON THIS NEW

293
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,112
TRIBE.

294
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,739
BUT IF ANYONE COULD SURVIVE

295
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,075
THIS, I CAN.

296
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,868
WHAT I LEARNED THE FIRST TIME I

297
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,413
PLAYED WAS I'M STRONG IN HEART.

298
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,747
I'M HERE TO WIN THIS GAME.

299
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,082
AND I'M GOING TO PLAY THE CARDS

300
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:52,216
THAT I'M DEALT.

301
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,176
>> ANYTHING DOWN THAT WAY?

302
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,761
>> WELL IS ALL THE WAY DOWN ON

303
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,472
THE POINT.

304
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,390
>> TERRY.

305
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,641
NICE THE MEET YOU, BUDDY.

306
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,976
I KNOW KELLY.

307
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,562
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

308
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,147
>> HEY, JOE.

309
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,231
HOW ARE YOU?

310
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,024

312
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:10,276
WHAT?

313
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,862
>> OH, MY GOD, WE CANNOT LOSE

314
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,154
ANYTHING.

315
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,448
>> LOOKING AT NEW TRIBE, WE HAVE

316
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,116
THREE OR FOUR NUMBER-ONE DRAFT

317
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:17,366
CHOICES.

318
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,659
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE LUCK.

319
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,243
IT'S SICK.

320
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,329
WE HAVE TO BRING THE CHICKENS IN

321
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:21,704
AND THE RICE.

322
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,539
I KNOW I'M WITH KELLY.

RELATIONSHIP.

326

WE DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS, BUT I

327
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,586
DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING THE NEED

328
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,128
THE NUMBERS.

329
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,671
A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE IN

330
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,173
THERE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE

331
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,049
GOING TO LOSE A CHALLENGE.

332
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,759
>> YOU GUYS DYING?

CHICKEN RICE.

342
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:56,947
PERFECT.

>> I THINK WE'RE FINE.

349
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,505
IT MAKES ME LESS ASSURED A

350
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:12,880
LITTLE BIT.

351
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,881
NOW WE CAN WIN.

352
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,343
WE HAVE TWO STRONG PEOPLE, TERRY

>> THIS IS A GREAT TRIBE.

360
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:29,814
>> AS LONG AS US FOUR STICK

361
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,191
TIGHT, WE HAVE NUMBERS, AND WE

362
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,861

WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER BEFORE.

374
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,963
SO IF OUR TRIBE LOSES, DIETZ OR

375
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,090
MYSELF WILL BE ON THE CHOPPING

376
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:56,674
BLOCK.

377
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,134
I JUST HAVE A FEELING THAT THE

378
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,051
FOUR ARE GOING TO STICK TOGETHER

379
00:11:59,135 --> 00:11:59,760
FOR THE NUMBERS.

380
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,596
>> DO YOU THINK TERRY COULD HAVE

381
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:02,972
AN IDOL?

382
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,015
>> ALL I KNOW IS HE AND SPENCER

383
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,809
WERE THE TWO LOOKING FOR IT THE

384
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,017
MOST.

385
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,477
TERRY WOULD GO OFF FOR HOURS.

386
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,521
THE IDOL IS STILL IN MY BAG, BUT

387
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,856
I'M PUSHING TERRY UNDER THE BUS,

388
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,276
JUST LIKE KICKING HIM UNDER.

389
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,445
THERE GO UNDER THAT BUS, TERRY.

390
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,531
GO, GO.

391
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:37,965
>> SO HOW DOES THIS COMPARE THE

392
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:38,340
YOUR GUYS BEACH?

393
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,675
>> THIS IS SO NICE.

394
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,051
IT'S WIDER.

395
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:46,223
>> OUR BEACH, WE HAVE A LOT MORE

396
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:46,515
TREE COVER.

397
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,309
>> WELL, WELCOME HOME, GUYS.

398
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:48,809
>> THANK YOU.

399
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,812
>> HERE AT THE NEW BAYON, WE

400
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,149
HAVE JEREMY, KIMMI, STEPHEN AND

401
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:55,774
MYSELF.

402
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,358
AND WE ARE IN THE MAJORITY AS

403
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,527
THE ORIGINAL BAYON MEMBERS.

404
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:11,457
WE ALSO HAVE SPENCER AND HE'S IN

405
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,249
THE MINORITY.

406
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:12,917
>> I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR

407
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,292
ANYTHING BETTER.

408
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,753
>> I LOVE THIS NEW TRIBE.

409
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,130
IT'S SO LIBERATING NOT TO BE IN

410
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,298
CAMP MACHO ANYMORE.

411
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,883
I WAS IN THE BOTTOM OF OUR

412
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,050
TRIBE.

413
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,301
THEN WE SWAPPED AND FOR THE

414
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:22,927
FIRST TIME EVER I KNOW I'M SAFE,

415
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:28,474
SO I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

416
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,935
>> I'M TRYING TO CUT IT IN HALF.

417
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,020
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO

418
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,104
THAT.

419
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,773
AND MY MACHETE SKILLS ARE

420
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,065
TERRIBLE.

421
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,816
>> I'M SOMEONE WHO HAS PLAYED

422
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,400
PRETTY LOGICALLY IN THE PAST,

423
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,987
BUT I'VE FAILED WHEN IT COMES TO

424
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,405
UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONS OF

425
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,031
PEOPLE, AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE

426
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,074
FLAW.

427
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,618
AND SO I'M TRYING SOMETHING NEW

428
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:47,952
ON THIS TRIBE.

429
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,705
I'M TRYING TO HAVE FEELINGS.

430
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,873
WHEN MY CURRENT GIRLFRIEND

431
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,083
STARTED SAYING, LIKE I LOVE YOU,

432
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,918
LIKE I DIDN'T SAY IT BACK.

433
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:56,794
>> REALLY?

434
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,003
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO...

435
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,296
>> NO, THAT'S GOOD.

436
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,715
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO.

437
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,925
>> SHE STILL, LIKE FEELS LIKE...

438
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,427
>> YOU HAVEN'T SAID IT YET?

439
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:05,594
>> NO.

440
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,972
>> OH, SNAP.

441
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,138
WOW.

442
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,390
>> I KNOW.

443
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,935
IT'S LIKE... I'M NOT THAT EASILY

444
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,602
EMOTIONAL, WITH ANYONE.

445
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,563
I STILL HAVE THAT...

446
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,021
>> GUARDED.

447
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,648
>> I'M TRYING TO APPROACH THIS

448
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,358
GAME IN A WAY THAT I CAN FORM

449
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,109
BONDS THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE

450
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,112
HELPFUL, AND THAT WILL CARRY ME

451
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:23,946
FURTHER, SO WHEN I TELL JEREMY

452
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,282
ABOUT SOMETHING REALLY HONEST,

453
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,908
WHICH IS MY CONCERNS ABOUT, YOU

454
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,494
KNOW, ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND, AND

455
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,496
WHEN I ASK HIM AND REALLY TRULY

456
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,122
CARE ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS, I WANT

457
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,250
TO GET TO KNOW HIM BECAUSE IT'S

458
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,167
SOMETHING I HAVEN'T TAKEN THE

459
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:37,960
TIME TO DO BEFORE, AND IT MIGHT

460
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,087
JUST MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY

461
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,130
GAME.

462
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,215
>> YOU THINK I'M HANDLING THAT

463
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:43,507
WRONG.

464
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,093
>> NO, BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO SAY

465
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,095
IT, IT'S GOING TO MEAN SO MUCH

466
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:48,304
MORE.

467
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,054
I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT...

468
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,889
>> THINKING ABOUT IT TOO MUCH?

469
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:51,307
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW.

470
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,309
>> I'M SURE I'M THINKING ABOUT

471
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,268
IT TOO MUCH.

472
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,312
>> WHEN SPENCER JOINED UP, HE

473
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,688
NEEDED TO TALK TO ME.

474
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,314
IT'S GOOD TO SIT DOWN AND TALK.

475
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,482
HE'S A STAND-UP GUY, SOMEONE YOU

476
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,900
CAN REALLY CONNECT WITH AND

477
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,569
TRUST.

478
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,153
HE'S FUNNY AND I'M BIG ON THE

479
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,154
KID.

480
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,614
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

481
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,072
I LOVE VAL.

482
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,075
GOING THROUGH "SURVIVOR" LAST

483
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,036
YEAR WITH HER, IT MULTIPLIED IT

484
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:12,328
BY LIKE TEN.

485
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,038
I THINK WE COULD DEFINITELY HAVE

486
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,080
A BOND.

487
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,582
I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG WE'LL KEEP

488
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,042
HIM, BUT WE CAN USE HIM FOR

489
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:18,917
RIGHT NOW.

490
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:19,293
I'LL TAKE THAT.

491
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,545
WHEN YOU SEE HER, I THINK THAT

492
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,129
WILL OPEN YOUR EYES A LITTLE

493
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,547
BIT.

494
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,299
WOW, LIKE I REALLY MISUS HER.

495
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,008
>> THAT WOULD BE A POWERFUL

496
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,052
THING FOR ME IF I GOT THAT

497
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:28,302
CLARITY.

498
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:45,694
>> THAT WOULD BE COOL.

499
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,664
>> I HATE THIS PLACE.

500
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,541
>> THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED

501
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,127
"SURVIVOR," I WAS ON ONE OF THE

502
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,420
MOST HORRIBLE TRIBES IN

503
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,129
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

504
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:04,630
I'VE WITHIN HERE BEFORE.

505
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,382
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE NOT TO

506
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:06,632
HAVE FOOD.

507
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,258
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE NOT TO

508
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,009
HAVE SHELTER.

509
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,178
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FIGHT

510
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,764
TO STAY IN THIS GAME, SO THIS,

511
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:19,311
THIS IS JUST ROUND TWO FOR ME.

512
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,813
>> YOU ARE TOTALLY DRY.

513
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,438
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

514
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,356
>> I'M IN THE DRY.

515
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,066
>> YOUR DRESS IS DRY.

516
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,192
>> MY DRESS IS NOT DRY.

517
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,985
>> YOU GOT THE GOOD SPOT IN THE

518
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:27,236
MIDDLE.

519
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:27,695
>> YOU WANT TO SWITCH.

520
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,739
>> NO, NO, NO.

521
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,116
>> NO, IT'S AWESOME.

522
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:32,533
I'M GLAD.

523
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,450
>> I'M NOT DRY.

524
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,204
>> ABI HAS A LITTLE BIT OF

525
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,163
RESENTMENT AGAINST PEIH-GEE FOR

526
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,540
SOMETHING.

527
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:44,837
THAT WORKS IN MY FAVOR.

528
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,629
THERE'S STILL TIME LEFT IN THE

529
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,297
DAY THE STRATEGIZE AND CONVERSE,

530
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,632
AND I'M GOING TO USE EVERY

531
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,176
MINUTE OF IT.

532
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,303
>> SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

533
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,305
YOUR GUYS TRIBE DYNAMIC.

534
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,434
>> AS A GROUP IT WAS REAL

535
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,310
HARMONIOUS, AND WE'RE GOLDEN.

536
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,979
WE'RE GOLDEN.

537
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,188
BUT THE POINT IS WHEN WE COME

538
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:08,152
BACK TOGETHER, I CAN GUARANTEE

539
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,194
UCT COATING CAN JOIN US.

540
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:14,158
>> MY OLD MEMBERS FROM TA KEO

541
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,243
WANT TA KEO STRONG, BUT PEIH-GEE

542
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,871
AND I HAD SOME ISSUES BACK AT TA

543
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,707
KEO, AND TASHA SORT OF WHISPERED

544
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,083
SOME SWEET NOTHINGS IN MY EAR.

545
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,710
>> IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK

546
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:24,918
ABOUT.

547
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,004
IF YOU AND SOMEONE ELSE...

548
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,464
>> THIS IS MY SECOND CHANCE.

549
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,758
I WANT TO GO TO THE END, SO I

550
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,467
REALLY, REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT

551
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,095
TO DO.

552
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,638
>> I WANT TO MAKE THE JURY.

553
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,222
I DIDN'T MAKE THE JURY FIRST

554
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,390
TIME.

555
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,099
I MADE IT RIGHT THERE AT IT AND

556
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,225
WENT HOME.

557
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,393
>> YOU COULD BE.

558
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,352
THERE THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

559
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:42,603
>> OKAY.

560
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,354
TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT MORE.

561
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:48,233
>> BOTH TRIBES HAVE FOUR OF OUR,

562
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:48,567
TWO OF YOURS.

563
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,652
IF THEY LOSE, THEY'RE GOING

564
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:50,819
HOME.

565
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,320
AND WE COME TO A MERGE.

566
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,614
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED US.

567
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,450
LIKE YOU WILL NEED US.

568
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,327
>> SAVAGE AND TASHA WANT ME TO

569
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,161
COME AND JOIN THEM.

570
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,872
THEY WILL GET ME TO THE JURY.

571
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,749
ISN'T THAT A LOVELY INVITATION.

572
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,375
IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS, WE CAN

573
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:05,959
TOTALLY DO THIS.

574
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,961
>> IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK

575
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:08,170
ABOUT.

576
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,296
>> I WANT TO SAY, HEY, YOU, YOU,

577
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,255
YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM.

578
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,258
THOSE TWO WE COULD GET RID OF

579
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:13,509
LIKE THAT.

580
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,176
>> I'M IN A TOUGH SPOT.

581
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,719
YOU FOUR ARE TIGHT.

582
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,178
>> I'M ALWAYS OPEN.

583
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,346
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE

584
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,472
MAKING DEALS.

585
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,723
THEY'RE RUNNING UP THE BEACH AND

586
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,182
TALKING TO EVERYBODY.

587
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,809
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT

588
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,392
TAKING AWAY ABI AND MARIA AND

589
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,020
PEIH-GEE, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT

590
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,688
THAT COULD GO WRONG.

591
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:46,708
>> WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT, WATCH

592
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:46,875
OUT.

593
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,210
WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT.

594
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,670
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

595
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:49,962
GET HIM OUT.

596
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,047
WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT.

597
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,674
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

598
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,342
>> THAT WAS AWESOME.

599
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,011
>> SPENCER AND WIGLESWORTH,

600
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,513
THEY'RE BOTH COZYING UP TO US

601
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,180
BECAUSE IT'S 4-2 RIGHT NOW.

602
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,392
SO WE HAVE AN UNBEATABLE

603
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,685
ADVANTAGE, BUT THE IDOL IS

604
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,186
SOMEWHERE ON THIS ISLAND, AND IT

605
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,981
COULD DESTROY EVERYTHING.

606
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,315
>> I HATE THERE ARE IDOLS OUT

607
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,400
THERE.

608
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,985
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE

609
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:13,318
IT IS.

610
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,737
>> YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY IS IT A

611
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,072
GREAT TOOL FOR MYSELF TO HAVE,

612
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,491
BUT IT'S A REAL SYMBOL THAT

613
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,743
BONDS AN ALLIANCE TOGETHER.

614
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,287
>> WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF WE

615
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,997
FOUND THIS IDOL FOR OUR

616
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,247
ALLIANCE.

617
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:25,747
THAT WOULD BE SO STRONG.

618
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,125
IT WOULD MAKE US STRONG.

619
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:28,750
I WOULD BE IN A POWER POSITION

620
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,336
ON A STRONG TRIBE WITH PEOPLE I

621
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,297
TRUST AND PEOPLE I LIKE.

622
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,925
SO ONE OF US NEEDS TO FIND THAT

623
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:42,222
IDOL.

624
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,516
>> THIS LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF

625
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:44,933
PLACE IT WOULD BE.

626
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,312
>> I KNOW.

627
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,397
>> I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN HERE,

628
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,902
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING,

629
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,570
CONSTANTLY.

630
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,488
>> I'M SO FRUSTRATED LOOKING FOR

631
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:58,780
THAT THING.

632
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,907
IT'S IN THE HERE.

633
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,908
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

634
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,325
IS IT ON THE GROUND?

635
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,410
IS IT IN A TREE?

636
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:03,744
IS IT HIGH UP?

637
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,495
IS IT IN THE WATER?

638
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,830
LIKE I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.

639
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,372
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

640
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,416
BUT THIS IS MY SECOND CHANCE,

641
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,375
AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO WORK

642
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:17,758
HARDER THIS TIME.

643
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,801
>> THE IDOL HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE

644
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,093
NOTICEABLE.

645
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,929
IT'S GOT TO BE SOME CRAZY TREE

646
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,597
OR JAGGED ROCK THAT'S JUST

647
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,015
OBVIOUS, BUT SO FAR IT'S NOT

648
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,224
OBVIOUS TO ME.

649
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,436
BUT, YOU KNOW, GOT TO KEEP

650
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,275
LOOKING.

651
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,944
>> THERE WAS A LITTLE TREE FULL

652
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,612
OF LEAVES, AND I STARTED DIGGING

653
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,448
IN IT, AND THE THING JUST POPPED

654
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,491
OUT.

655
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,327
I WAS SO PUMPED.

656
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,912
CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE FOUND A

657
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,496
CLUE TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

658
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,664
IDOL.

659
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,373
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR NEXT

660
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,208
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, ON THE BACK

661
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,418
OF A THIRD BOX IS MY HIDDEN

662
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,504
IMMUNITY IDOL.

663
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,755
FINALLY, TWO SEASONS IT TAKES,

664
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,715
AND I FINALLY FIND SOMETHING,

665
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,424
BUT IS IT AN IDOL?

666
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,927
NO, IT'S NOT AN IDOL, IT'S A

667
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,887
CLUE TO AN IDOL THAT I HAVE TO

668
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,931
GRAB WHEN 18 PEOPLE ARE PLAYING

669
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,307
AROUND ME.

670
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,600
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT WORK.

671
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,559
WE'RE GOING TO GET.

672
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,852
THIS I'M GOING TO BRING THIS

673
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,938
THING HOME.

674
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:30,747
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

675
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:35,377
ALL RIGHT.

676
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,087
SHALL WE GET TO YOUR FIRST

677
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,547
IMMUNITY IDOL AS THREE TRIBES?

678
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,381
>> YES, SIR.

679
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:44,094
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.

680
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,637
MONICA, I'M TAKE THAT BACK.

681
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,514
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

682
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,725
FOR GRABS ALONG WITH A SECOND

683
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,183
IDOL.

684
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,936
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK:

685
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,895
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, EACH

686
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,521
TRIBE WILL PUSH A CART THROUGH

687
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,398
AN OBSTACLE COURSE.

688
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,402
AT EACH TOWER, YOU RECEIVE A

689
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:00,569
KEY.

690
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,573
YOU'LL USE THAT KEY TO UNLOCK A

691
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:04,990
CHEST.

692
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,324
PUT THE CHEST ON THE CART AND

693
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,159
CONTINUE ON.

694
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,994
ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED ALL THREE

695
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:09,661
CHESTS, YOU MUST THEN

696
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,038
DISASSEMBLE THE CART, SLIDE IT

697
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,456
THROUGH A BARRICADE, PUT IT BACK

698
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,458
TOGETHER AND MAKE YOUR WAY TO

699
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,294
THE END WHERE TWO TRIBE MEMBERS

700
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,004
WILL USE THE PIECES INSIDE THE

701
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:24,342
CHEST TO ASSEMBLE A GIANT DRAGON

702
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:24,760
PUZZLE.

703
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,553
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN

704
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,930
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

705
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,766
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

706
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,725
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE THIRD

707
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,769
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SECOND

708
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,019
CHANCE."

709
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,938
THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST

710
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,774
CHALLENGE OF BRAINS VERSUS BRAWN

711
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,858
VERSUS BEAUTY.

712
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,568
SPENCER, TASHA, KASS ALL

713
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,695
PARTICIPATED ON THE SAME BRAIN

714
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,198
TRIBE, A MISERABLE PERFORMANCE.

715
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,200
THEY LOST, WENT TO TRIBAL

716
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:48,784
COUNCIL.

717
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,660
SO BECAUSE EACH OF YOU ARE ON A

718
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,453
DIFFERENT TRIBE RIGHT NOW, THIS

719
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,789
SECOND CHANCE WILL OFFER

720
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,957
REDEMPTION FOR TWO OF YOU, AND

721
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,293
FOR ONE OF YOU HISTORY WILL

722
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,920
REPEAT ITSELF.

723
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:00,212
BIG STAKES.

724
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,421
TAKE A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE AND

725
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:08,386
WE'LL GET STARTED.

726
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,394
ALL RIGHT.

727
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,896
HERE WE GO.

728
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:21,983

ALL THREE TRIBES FAST OUT OF THE

731
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:30,992
GATE.

732
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:31,660
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THAT KEY.

733
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,747
SPENCER HAS THE KEY FOR BAYON.

734
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,581
WOO WORKING ON THAT KEY FOR

735
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,833
ANGKOR.

736
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,708
HE'S GOT IT.

737
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,378
KELLY HAS THE KEY FOR TA KEO.

738
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,296
UNLOCK THAT CHEST AND GET IT ON

739
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,464
THE CART.

740
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,715
CAN'T MOVE FORWARD UNTIL YOU

741
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,676
HAVE YOUR CHEST ON YOUR CART.

742
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,552
TA KEO FIRST OUT OF THE GATE.

743
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,679
BAYON HAS THEIRS.

744
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,390
ANGKOR RIGHT BEHIND.

745
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,351
KELLY HAS THE SECOND KEY FOR TA

746
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:56,518
KEO.

747
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,644
SPENCER STRUGGLING, TRYING TO

748
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,313
GET THAT SECOND KEY.

749
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,482

939
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,501
A RAT, WE GOT A RAT."

940
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,877
>> JEFF, WE'RE TRYING TO BOND.

941
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,213
THAT DOESN'T SEND A GOOD

942
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:58,421
MESSAGE.

943
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,256
>> I MADE A DEAL WITH YOU AND TO

944
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,882
TURNED RIGHT AROUND AND MADE A

945
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,717
DEAL WITH HER.

946
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,176
>> JEFF, YOU'RE WRONG.

947
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,929
>> ARE WE STILL AN ALLIANCE?

948
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:06,804
>> YES, YES.

949
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,056
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE A DEAL

950
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,475
WITH ME?

951
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,561
>> Jeff: SO, WOO, YOU'RE

952
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:13,853
FRUSTRATED?

953
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:14,437
>> IT'S NO SURPRISE I GET THE

954
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,023
LAST WORD AT THE VERY LAST

955
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,066
SECOND.

956
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,692
DISAPPOINTED AGAIN.

957
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:25,532
>> Jeff: TA KEO, BAYON, GRAB

958
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:30,995
YOUR STUFF.

959
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,540
ANGKOR, SOMETIMES IT'S ALL HOW

960
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:33,915
YOU LOOK AT IT.

961
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:39,462
THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A

962
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,673
GREAT UNDERDOG STORY, BUT IN

963
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,882
ORDER TO BE AN UNDERDOG, YOU

964
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,009
HAVE TO HIT ROCK BOTTOM, AND IT

965
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,011
LOOKS LIKE THE BEGINNING OF

966
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,679
THAT.

967
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,263
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

968
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:48,471
CAMP.

969
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,098
>> TASHA CALLED ME A RAT.

970
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,057
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

971
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,850
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIG OLE

972
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,060
MESS AND I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A

973
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:57,146
WAY TO GET OUT OF IT.

974
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,252
>> THIS MORNING I THOUGHT

975
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:19,961
GUARANTEED I'M GOING HOME, BUT

976
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,963
VARNER'S MELTDOWN AFTER THE

977
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:22,505
CHALLENGE, I THINK PAINTED A

978
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,174
HUGE TARGET ON HIS BACK.

979
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,259
>> GOOD EFFORT, EVERYBODY.

980
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,969
>> EVERYONE ON THIS TRIBE LOOKED

981
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,762
AT HIM LIKE, OH, MY GOSH, YOU

982
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,138
CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

983
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:35,685
>> HE'S LIED BEFORE.

984
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,812
>> I WAS LIKE A LITTLE KID

985
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:38,187
INSIDE JUST GIDDY.

986
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,063
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HE JUST

987
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:43,026
HANDED ME AMMUNITION ON A SILVER

988
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,569
PLATTER.

989
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,822
>> PEIH-GEE, IF YOU TAKE ME OUT

990
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,073
OF THE PHYSICAL PART OF THESE

991
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,950
CHALLENGE, IT'S NOT GOING TO GET

992
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,452
EASIER.

993
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,870
JEFF'S NOT PULLING HIS WEIGHT AT

994
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,537
CAMP.

995
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,706
HE'S SLEEPING ALL DAY.

996
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,166
HE STARTS SCRAMBLING, HE'S

997
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:58,750
CALLING PEOPLE OUT.

998
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,834
>> I NOTICED THAT.

999
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:01,586
>> WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THAT YOU

1000
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,505
GUYS TRUST ME AND THAT WE VOTE

1001
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,131
HIM.

1002
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,383
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

1003
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,968
>> WELL, PEIH-GEE, YOU WANT TO

1004
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,720
HAVE A TALK, JUST YOU AND I FOR

1005
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,137
A SECOND?

1006
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,346
>> YEAH.

1007
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,681
I THINK YOU MADE A REALLY GOOD

1008
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,265
CASE.

1009
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,642
GOOD LAWYER.

1010
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,185
>> THANKS.

1011
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,604
>> HE MAKES A GOOD POINT.

1012
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,023
IF WE VOTE OFF TASHA OR SAVAGE,

1013
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:22,982
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MANY MORE

1014
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,400
CHALLENGES TO COME.

1015
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,277
>> I KNOW.

1016
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:30,031
>> VARNER, WE'RE STILL IN THE

1017
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:30,323
MAJORITY.

1018
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:30,948
>> IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO JOIN

1019
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,117
UP WITH SAVAGE AND TASHA.

1020
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,036
ARE THEY GOING TO BE LOYAL?

1021
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,871
I DON'T KNOW.

1022
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,247
YOU HAVE TO TAKE EVERYTHING

1023
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:38,831
DESPERATE PEOPLE SAY WITH A

1024
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,209
GRAIN OF SALT.

1025
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,430
>> EXACTLY.

1026
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:04,023
>> AFTER I SAW HOW UNPREDICTABLE

1027
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,817
VARNER IS, I THINK HE NEEDS TO

1028
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,070
GO NEXT.

1029
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,196
BUT WOO DID VOTE FOR ME, AND HE

1030
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,864
DETESTS ME, TOO.

1031
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:18,204
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I CAN

1032
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:18,621
TRUST HER.

1033
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,872
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

1034
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,166
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING.

1035
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,625
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO

1036
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:22,917
EVERYBODY.

1037
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,586
>>THEY WANT US TO VOTE OUT JEFF?

1038
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,547
>> IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

1039
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,673
>> WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT.

1040
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,259
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP

1041
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,385
YOUR MIND.

1042
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,053
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

1043
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,513
VOTING THESE GUYS.

1044
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,265
>> I KNOW THAT I'M ON THE BOTTOM

1045
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,850
WITH YOU GUYS AND I'M IN THE ON

1046
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:39,600
THE BOTTOM WITH THEM.

1047
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,226
SO I'M GOING TO VOTE WITH THEM.

1048
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,228
I ALREADY MADE UP MY MIND.

1049
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,688
SO IT'S UP TO YOU WHAT YOU WANT

1050
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,313
TO DO.

1051
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,107
>> WE WERE TIGHT SINCE WE'VE

1052
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,816
GOTTEN HERE.

1053
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,608
I THOUGHT WE WERE COOL.

1054
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,318
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT US.

1055
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,486
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO IS GOING

1056
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,487
TO BE GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1057
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,822
THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT

1058
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,823
DOESN'T NEED TO HAPPEN RIGHT

1059
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,157
NOW, PEIH-GEE.

1060
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,492
>> FIRST OF ALL, WHERE DID ALL

1061
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,410
THIS ANIMOSITY COME FROM?

1062
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,161
SHE'S LIKE, I'M NOT WITH YOU AND

1063
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,579
WOO.

1064
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,204
I KNOW I'M ON THE BOTTOM WITH

1065
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,956
YOU GUYS.

1066
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,874
I'M VOTING WITH THEM.

1067
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,041
THAT'S HOW I'M VOTING.

1068
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,626
THAT MADE UP MY MIND, I WANTED

1069
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:05,918
HER GONE.

1070
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,503
>> I DON'T LIKE HOW SHE'S

1071
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,004
TALKING TO ME.

1072
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:08,963
I WANT TO VOTE HER OUT.

1073
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,923
>> SHE'S STRONGER THAN JEFF.

1074
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:11,924
SHE IS.

1075
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,593
>> I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE YOU

1076
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,763
GUYS OUT, BUT...

1077
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:16,971
>> YEAH.

1078
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,139
>> I'M LOOK AT TASHA.

1079
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,932
SHE'S LOOKING AT ME STUNNED.

1080
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,434
>> I DON'T LIKE HOW SHE'S

1081
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:21,768
TALKING TO ME.

1082
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,312
>> IT'S SO EASY.

1083
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,773
IT'S SO EASY TO CREATE SUSPICION

1084
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,733
OR MISDIRECTION BETWEEN PEIH-GEE

1085
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,318
AND ABI.

1086
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:35,198
PEIH-GEE WANTS TO VOTE ABI.

1087
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:40,119
SO YOU AND TASH VOTE PEIH-GEE.

1088
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,579
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY

1089
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,332
EVERYTHING CHANGED ON THIS

1090
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,669
TRIBE.

1091
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,213
>> I CAME BACK TO THIS CAMP

1092
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,381
THINKING I WAS DONE, BUT IF I

1093
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,342
CAN TAKE THIS CLOUD THAT'S OVER

1094
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,052
ME RIGHT NOW AND SLING IT OVER

1095
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,512
SOMEBODY ELSE, I'M GOING TO DO

1096
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,013
IT.

1097
00:34:59,096 --> 00:34:59,764
>> THAT IT?

1098
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,014
>> YEAH.

1099
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,475
>> THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME.

1100
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,518
>> THAT'S IT.

1101
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,895
I APPRECIATE YOU AND WOO.

1102
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,271
I LIKE YOU GUYS SO MUCH, I WANT

1103
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:07,730
TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS.

1104
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,148
>> OPTIONS ARE OPENING UP.

1105
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,193
PEIH-GEE WILL BE VOTING ABI, AND

1106
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,946
ABI WILL BE VOTING PEIH-GEE.

1107
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,405
THE THING ABOUT ABI IS YOU DON'T

1108
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,949
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET,

1109
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,701
AND PEIH-GEE, SHE'S INDECISIVE.

1110
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,786
SO IT'S HARD.

1111
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,164
IT'S A TOUGH DECISION, BUT IT

1112
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,207
FEELS FANTASTIC TO HAVE THE

1113
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,292
TABLES TURNED.

1114
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,878
SAVAGE AND I WERE DOWN 4-2.

1115
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,004
ALL HOPE SEEMED LOVES.

1116
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,673
BUT HERE WE ARE MAKING THE

1117
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:39,053
DECISIONS ON WHO WILL GO HOME

1118
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:46,853
TONIGHT.

1119
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:03,536
>> Jeff: SAVAGE AND TASHBACK

1120
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,120
GRAB A TORCH.

1121
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:09,125
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

1122
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,043
AS PART OF THE RITUAL AS TRIBAL

1123
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,170
COUNCIL, BECAUSE FIRE REPRESENTS

1124
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:12,628
YOUR LIFE.

1125
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,423
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE

1126
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,093
YOU.

1127
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,678
SO SAVAGE, LET'S START BY GOING

1128
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,388
BACK TO THE SWITCH.

1129
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,431
FIRST REACTION WAS WHAT?

1130
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,266
>> I COULDN'T PROCESS IT.

1131
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,477
IT WAS TOO MUCH IN TERMS OF THE

1132
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,687
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WORK TO GET

1133
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,313
JUST REASONABLE SHELTER,

1134
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,315
REASONABLE CAMP, AND THEN TO SEE

1135
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,359
THAT THERE'S TWO BAYONS AND FOUR

1136
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,987
TA KEOS, TOUGH TO PROCESS.

1137
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,614
>> Jeff: SO PEIH-GEE, IS IT A

1138
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,407
FAIR ASSUMPTION TO SAY SAVAGE

1139
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,993
AND TASHA WOULD PROBABLY BE IN

1140
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,619
TROUBLE SIMPLY BASED ON HISTORY.

1141
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,662
>> THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

1142
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,997
WHEN YOU'RE IN A SWAP AND YOU'RE

1143
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,123
IN THE MINORITY FROM THE

1144
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,791
ORIGINAL TRIBE, YOU'RE IN

1145
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,042
TROUBLE.

1146
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,418
>> Jeff: NOW LET'S FAST

1147
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,670
FORWARD TO TODAY'S CHALLENGE

1148
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,297
WHERE A MELTDOWN OCCURRED.

1149
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,008
>> HI.

1150
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,426
>> Jeff: JEFF, WHAT WAS

1151
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:00,801
HAPPENING THERE?

1152
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,595
>> I WAS SENDING A SIGNAL TO

1153
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,638
SOMEONE ON THE OTHER TRIBE I

1154
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,472
CARE ABOUT, AND TASHA JUST JUMPS

1155
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,141
OUT OF NOWHERE AND CALLS ME A

1156
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,434
RAT, AND I WASN'T BEING A RAT.

1157
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,810
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS BEING A

1158
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,394
RAT.

1159
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,520
AND THAT JUST HIT ME.

1160
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,647
I'VE HAD NO SLEEP.

1161
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,898
I'VE HAD IN FOOD.

1162
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:14,941
I'M EMOTIONAL.

1163
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,192
AND HONESTLY, I DON'T REMEMBER

1164
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:16,651
IT.

1165
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,319
IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL MELTDOWN

1166
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,612
THAT I DON'T RECALL.

1167
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,489
>> Jeff: TASHA, I HAVE A

1168
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:21,989
FEELING YOU REMEMBER IT.

1169
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:22,448
>> I DO.

1170
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,325
AND, JEFF, MY MAMA ALWAYS TOLD

1171
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,162
ME, KEEP YOUR FAMILY BUSINESS AT

1172
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:28,746
HOME.

1173
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,040
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER ISSUES WE

1174
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:31,624
HAD, WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT

1175
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,167
AMONGST THE FAMILY.

1176
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,628
ALL I KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS

1177
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,837
COMMUNICATION WHEN OUR FAMILY'S

1178
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,797
RIGHT HERE.

1179
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,882
SO MY INITIAL THOUGHT WAS, TAKE

1180
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,634
'EM OUT NOW SO THAT WE DON'T

1181
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:42,468
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOYALTY

1182
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,179
LATER ON.

1183
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:45,930
>> Jeff: SO, JEFF, YOU THINK

1184
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:46,889
YOU ARE GOING HOME?

1185
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,891
>> PEOPLE CAN OVERCOME ALL KINDS

1186
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,768
OF THINGS.

1187
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,352
WOULDN'T BIT GREAT IF I COULD

1188
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:57,900
ESCAPE WITHOUT ONE VOTE?

1189
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,235
>> Jeff: IS THERE A PLAN?

1190
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,654
WHO SHOULD GO HOME?

1191
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,321
>> I'VE HEARD SO MANY NAMES

1192
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,489
THROWN AROUND, I HAVE NO IDEA

1193
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,783
WHO IS GOING HOME.

1194
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,326
>> Jeff: WHOSE NAME HAVE YOU

1195
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:07,743
HEARD THROWN AROUND?

1196
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,079
>> I'VE HEARD ABI'S NAME THROWN

1197
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:10,913
AROUND.

1198
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:11,914
I'VE HEARD PEIH-GEE'S NAME

1199
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,165
THROWN AROUND.

1200
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,083
I'VE HEARD MY NAME THROWN

1201
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:14,333
AROUND.

1202
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,418
SO I GUESS SAVAGE AND TASHA HAVE

1203
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,544
FOUND THEIR WAY FROM THE BOTTOM

1204
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,671
OF THE HEAP TO THE TOP.

1205
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,506
>> Jeff: TO THE TOP?

1206
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:20,715
>> YES.

1207
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,259
I THINK ALL THE CHOICES AND

1208
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,260
DECISIONS OF WHAT HAPPENS HERE

1209
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:24,844
TONIGHT COME FROM THE TWO OF

1210
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,928
THEM.

1211
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,472
>> Jeff: SO ABI, IF HE'S

1212
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,640
TELLING THE TRUTH, THE FOUR OF

1213
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,726
YOU, PEIH-GEE, YOURSELF, VARNER

1214
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,560
AND WOO ARE NOT ALL TOGETHER,

1215
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:39,859
WHICH IS THE CRASH SAVAGE WOULD

1216
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,067
NEED.

1217
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,527
>> RIGHT, AND I HAVE A STRONG

1218
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,529
FEELING I MAY BE GOING HOME

1219
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:43,946
TONIGHT.

1220
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,989
>> Jeff: BASED ON WHAT?

1221
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,991
>> BASED ON CONVERSATIONS AROUND

1222
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:47,450
CAMP I WASN'T PART OF.

1223
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,368
I'M NOT THAT NAIVE.

1224
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,619
>> Jeff: PEIH-GEE, IF IT'S

1225
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,079
YOU, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN

1226
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,123
SAY TO SWAY THEM?

1227
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,708
>> THIS GAME IS CRAZY.

1228
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,044
I WANT TO BE WITH PEOPLE I FEEL

1229
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,211
SOLID WITH AND I TRUST.

1230
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,212
YOU ALL CAN TRUST ME.

1231
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,797
IF I GAVE YOU MY WORD.

1232
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:02,798
I'M GOOD WITH IT.

1233
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,090
I'M STEADY.

1234
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,134
I'M LOYAL.

1235
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,427
>> Jeff: PRETTY GOOD PITCH,

1236
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,136
ABI.

1237
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,471
WHAT'S YOURS?

1238
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,222
>> MINE IS PRETTY SIMILAR TO

1239
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:10,806
HERS.

1240
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,308
I'VE BEEN WORKING AROUND CAMP,

1241
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,727
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY

1242
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,522
HARD AND HAVING STRONG.

1243
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,149
MY LEVEL OF COMMITMENT IS HUGE

1244
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,693
BECAUSE I AM A COMMITTAL PERSON.

1245
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,570
>> Jeff: SO, JEFF, NOW YOU'VE

1246
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,404
HEARD ALL THE FEEDBACK.

1247
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:25,946
WHAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT?

1248
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,032
>> I SAID IT EARLIER.

1249
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,450
I HAVE NO IDEA, BUT I BELIEVE

1250
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,493
WHAT I SAID.

1251
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,661
SAVAGE AND TASHA ARE IN CONTROL

1252
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:37,625
OF TONIGHT'S VOTE.

1253
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,043
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1254
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,836
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1255
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:50,221
PEIH-GEE, YOU'RE UP.

1256
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,099
>> I'VE WANTED YOU OUT SINCE DAY

1257
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,016
ONE.

1258
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,477
HOPEFULLY IT WILL WORK THIS

1259
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,692
TIME.

1260
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,490
>> YOU TALK WAY TOO MUCH.

1261
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,700
YOU CAN SHUT YOUR MOUTH, TAKE A

1262
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:16,914
CHILL PILL, GIRL.

1263
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:30,010
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1264
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,097
VOTES.

1265
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,311
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1266
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,563
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1267
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:45,526
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1268
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,777
OKAY.

1269
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,070
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1270
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:48,737
DECISION IS FINAL.

1271
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,114
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1272
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,657
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1273
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,408
IMMEDIATELY.

1274
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:56,328
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1275
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,540
FIRST VOTE ABI.

00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,716
ABI.

1278
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:08,966
PEIH-GEE.

1279
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:09,717
WE'RE TIED.

1280
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,387
TWO VOTES ABI, TWO VOTES

1281
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:13,637
PEIH-GEE.

1282
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,805
PEIH-GEE.

1283
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,974
THAT'S THREE VOTES PEIH-GEE, TWO

1284
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:22,229
VOTES ABI, ONE VOTE LEFT.

1285

PEIH-GEE.

1288
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:31,238
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1289
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:41,040
>> WELL PLAYED, GUYS.

1290
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:46,503
WOO, GOOD LUCK.

1291
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,296
>> Jeff: PEIH-GEE, THE TRIBE

1292
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:57,973
HAS SPOKEN.

1293
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,516
WELL, ONE OF THE KEYS THE

1294
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,559
LASTING IN THIS GAME IS YOU HAVE

1295
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:04,730
TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT ON A DIME IN

1296
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,064
ANY SITUATION.

1297
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,650
IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE GONE.

1298
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,777
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR

1305
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,252

>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1307
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,509
"SURVIVOR," ANGKOR IS IN MISERY.

1308
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,136
>> WE SURVIVE A NIGHT IN THIS

1309
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,514
HELLHOLE, NO RESOURCES, NO

1310
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,098
SHELTER, NOTHING.

1311
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,642
THIS IS A DEAD COVE.

1312
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,811
WE'RE IN HELL RIGHT NOW.

1313
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,645
>> Jeff: BUT THEY'RE NOT THE

1314
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:48,107
ONLY ONES WHO ARE SUFFERING.

1315
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:55,406
>> WATCH OUT!

1316
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,573
>> THEY GOT ME GOOD.

1317
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,783
I GUESS I GOT BLIND SIDED.

1318
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,369
I FEEL REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN

1319
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,372
TASHA AND SAVAGE BECAUSE I

1320
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,164
TRUSTED THEM.

1321
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,374
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS MISPLACED.

1322
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,292
I WASN'T EXPECTING.

1323
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:06,917
THIS I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GO

1324
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,877
A LOT FURTHER.

1325
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,254
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF THEY WANT

1326
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,672
TO THROW THEIR LOT IN WITH ABI,

1327
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,047
GOOD LUCK TO THEM.

1328
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,966
SHE'S A HANDFUL.
