00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,851
special episode of<i> Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,938
<i>China,</i> we'll take a closer look

4
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,231
at how the final seven survivors

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,859
made it deep into the game.

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,486
Todd.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,821
>> I'm smaller than the rest of

8
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,780
our people, but I'm quick and

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,865
I'm smart.

10
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:32,741
>> PROBST: Courtney.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:33,533
>> My strength is that I'm not a

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,492
strong player.

13
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,452
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee.

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,327
>> I'm going to come off as a

15
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,120
bitch and I'm going to come off

16
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:37,412
as bossy.

17
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,038
>> PROBST: Erik.

18
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:39,914
>> Unless I'm way off, I haven't

19
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,790
made any enemies.

20
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,666
>> PROBST: Denise.

21
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,500
>> I want to stay in this game

22
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,710
as long as I possibly can.

23
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,794
>> PROBST: Amanda.

24
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,795
>> I try hard.

25
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,671
I'm athletic.

26
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,757
I am a huge threat in this game.

27
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,883
>> PROBST: And James.

28
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,384
>> I really would love to see

29
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,761
how these people would be

30
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,887
without me being here.

31
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,263
It would be hilarious.

32
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,222
Because they honestly would be

33
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,432
dead.

34
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,391
>> Watch your mouth, dude.

35
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,142
Word gets around.

36
00:00:59,225 --> 00:00:59,601
>> Todd, when you come

37
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,185
confronting me, make sure you

38
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,061
know what you're talking about.

39
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:02,645
>> PROBST: We'll also see how

40
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,189
their stories unfolded...

41
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,231
>> Bottoms up, baby.

42
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,316
>> PROBST: ...with 14 scenes of

43
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,400
all new footage.

44
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,401
>> I ate the legs and a little

45
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,652
bit of the ass and now I'm

46
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,196
craving frog.

47
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,155
>> If we lose, you're going

48
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,364
home.

49
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,283
>> My impression of Jaime.

50
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,577
>> Oh, my god.

51
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,411
>> If you're not in the mood to

52
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,204
accept my apology, that's fine.

53
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:19,412
>> No.

54
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,955
I know what kind of person you

55
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,664
are.

56
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,457
>> James...

57
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,291
>> PROBST: New twists constantly

58
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,501
reshaped the game...

59
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,460
Fei Long, you now get to kidnap

60
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,128
one member of their tribe.

61
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,338
...into one of the most

62
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:36,679
unpredictable<i> Survivors</i> ever.

63
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,056
And for the first time ever, one

castaway holds two immunity

65
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,391
idols...

66
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,310
>> I cannot stop smiling,

67
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,603
because I'm not going anywhere.

68
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,729
It's all good, baby.

69
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,855
>> PROBST: ...making him

70
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,107

>> PROBST: 27 days ago, 16

76
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,637
Americans traveled to a remote

77
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,430
section of rural China for the

78
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,474
adventure of a lifetime.

79
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,814
Their journey got off to a

80
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,316
grueling start.

81
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,317
>> We don't know how many more

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,359
stairs there are.

83
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,777
>> Have mercy.

84
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,945
>> Goodness.

85
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:16,988
>> I don't see the end.

86
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,156
>> Guys, it's a long way to go.

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:18,781
>> We got to the temple, I mean,

88
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,033
it was hard.

89
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:20,909
We are carrying bags up 450

90
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,243
stairs and we figured, "Oh, this

91
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,620
is it.

92
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,621
We're ready to start this thing

93
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,371
up."

94
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,582
>> We should build shelter right

95
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,458
here.

96
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,793
>> More stairs?

97
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,337
We're just climbing up these

98
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,379
really steep stairs.

99
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,422
And every time they curved

100
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,256
around, and every time we

101
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,591
thought we were there, it's

102
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,426
another curve, and another

103
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,386
curve.

104
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,389
>> I'm telling you guys, ain't

105
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,724
no money at the top of this

106
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,017
hill.

107
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,393
You might as well slow down.

108
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,229
We'll go another ten.

109
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,231
>> All the young kids, they're

110
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:52,857
all, like, grabbing their stuff,

111
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,317
running up the hills.

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,818
The big guys have got them over

113
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,778
their heads and they're walking

114
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,196
up.

115
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:58,738
I got stuck with Chicken.

116
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,865
He's like, "Take it slow.

117
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,449
You don't have been to rush.

118
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,325
Ten at a time.

119
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,160
We're going to do ten this

120
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,078
time."

121
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:05,954
And he'd stop and sit down and

122
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:06,955
wipe his brow.

123
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:07,956
I'm like, "All right, I'm going

124
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,790
to hang with this dude for a

125
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,459
while."

126
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,010
>> Thank you.

127
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,345
>> Welcome to China.

128
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:29,352
(<i> applause</i> )

129
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,194
>> I was, like, looking at my

130
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,112
outfit.

131
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,071
I was uncomfortable and I was

132
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,155
embarrassed.

133
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:41,781
It's definitely not appropriate

134
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,532
for a temple.

135
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,449
>> Come on, girls.

136
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,325
Cover up the boobies for temple.

137
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,451
>> The Buddhist monks actually

138
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,745
came over and gave us drapes.

139
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,831
Almost all the girls had to use

140
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:50,415
drapes over their dresses.

141
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,375
I'm sure they don't get a whole

142
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,252
lot of skimpy dresses in the

143
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,545
temple.

144
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,924
>> PROBST: During the Buddhist

145
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:05,179
welcoming ceremony Leslie had a

146
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,265
moral dilemma.

147
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,516
>> I'm a believer in Jesus

148
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,892
Christ, and in the bible it

149
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,352
says, "Thou shall not bow down

150
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,729
to any other god."

151
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,022
You know, it really felt like

152
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:14,939
worship, and I just couldn't do

153
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,733
it.

154
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,984
>> PROBST: When the ceremony

155
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,318
ended, the survivors were split

156
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,445
into two tribes.

157
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,571
Yellow tribe, your name is Zhan

158
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,032
Hu, which means "Fighting

159
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,450
Tiger."

160
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,576
Red tribe, your name is Fei

161
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,870
Long-- it means "Flying Dragon."

162
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,495
All right, good luck, guys.

163
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,249
>> Thanks so much.

164
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,174
>> PROBST: After settling into

165
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,300
camp, Todd nominated Aaron to be

166
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,886
the leader of Fei Long.

167
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,095
>> We do need someone who's

168
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:46,971
strong and knows how to take

169
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:47,972
lead, and you're very good at

170
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,390
it.

171
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,434
>> It feels weird, but I can...

172
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,978
I think I can did it.

173
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:54,562
>> I am very, very smart in

174
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,899
trying to push the leader role

175
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,525
more so on to Aaron.

176
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,568
>> PROBST: While over at Zhan

177
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,321
Hu, Chicken's assertiveness was

178
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,989
squashed.

179
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:05,615
>> You think this here is going

180
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,491
to hold up?

181
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,492
>> We have to build something,

182
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,451
though, so let's stop being

183
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,536
negative.

184
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,454
>> I was just giving my opinion

185
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,789
and nobody wanted it, so I'm

186
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,082
done suggesting.

187
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:14,665
>> PROBST: After three days of

188
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,251
intense hunger, Zhan Hu resorted

189
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:17,835
to eating anything they could

190
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,880
get their hands on.

191
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,515
>> Oh, yeah.

192
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,184
>> Just don't stare at it.

193
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,729
>> Just squeeze.

194
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,647
>> It's like popping a big,

195
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,358
nasty zit.

196
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,068
>> Eww!

197
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:42,568
That's disgusting, Erik.

198
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,029
>> Dude, I'm hungry.

199
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,072
We weren't find any plants we

200
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,073
could eat that were edible, and

201
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,449
we couldn't get the fire, so no

202
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,700
rice, so there was nothing.

203
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,286
I was just ready to eat

204
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,372
something.

205
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:57,917
>> You know, that's TMI, man,

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,128
milking worms.

207
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,504
>> Milking worm poo.

208
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,672
>> I'm, like, sitting here, we

209
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,631
squeezing poop out of worms, and

210
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,882
making people eat them, but I

211
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,842
think they'll be glad they

212
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,801
pushed the boundaries, and I

213
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,760
think that's the key to

214
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,387
surviving out here.

215
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,346
>> Shoot it!

216
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,181
>> I'm hard core.

217
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:12,640
>> Whoo!

218
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,767
>> Ching.

219
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,726
>> I'm doing three big guys

220
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,727
here.

221
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,481
>> Oh, just... ah!

222
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,450
>> Do it.

223
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,119
>> Whoo!

224
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,413
>> Ew!

225
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,664
>> Oh!

226
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,666
>> We're still living so

227
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,834
primitively.

228
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,918
Nothing to eat.

229
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,544
We're drinking dirty rain.

230
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,838
Bugs.

231
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,173
You know, they're eating worms.

232
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,216
I mean, it's just gross.

233
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,633
It's just filthy.

234
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,970
It's disgusting.

235
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,598
>> Oh, yeah, that wasn't bad at

236
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:53,764
all.

237
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,515
>> See?

238
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,434
>> I could do another one.

239
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,602
>> PROBST: But worms weren't the

240
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,603
only strange foods the tribes

241
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,688
ate.

242
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,773
>> Oh, my god.

243
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,693
Frogs became a culinary island

244
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,195
treat.

245
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:07,570
>> Roasted frog.

246
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,488
>> I ate the legs and a little

247
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,573
bit of the ass, and now I'm

248
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,533
craving frog.

249
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,534
>> Did you eat the first one,

250
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:13,743
dude?

251
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,828
>> Yeah.

252
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,831
>> PROBST: And eating greens had

253
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,083
a whole new meaning.

254
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,423
>> Good morning, guys.

255
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,633
Got breakfast.

256
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,717
>> Oh, look at that.

257
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,635
>> PROBST: The survivors even

258
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,802
resorted to eating roots from

259
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,096
the water.

260
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,729
>> With some lime juice.

261
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,397
That would be good.

262
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,440
>> Courtney, do you want some of

263
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,399
this rice?

264
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,150
>> I do.

265
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,568
>> Did you guys just have this

266
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,070
like, today, really?

267
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,072
>> Is it okay?

268
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,031
>> PROBST: But nothing killed

269
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,491
appetites more than spoiled

270
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,408
rice.

271
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,493
>> Oh, my gosh.

272
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,787
This is so nasty.

273
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,083
>> The mother lode!

274
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:02,917
>> PROBST: And even clams were

275
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,918
questionable...

276
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:04,877
>> I don't think these things

277
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,795
are cooked all the way.

278
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,587
>> What?

279
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,546
>> All right, you eat it, then.

280
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,381
>> You think I'm not going to

281
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,340
eat that?

282
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,549
>> PROBST: ...which caused a lot

283
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,550
of bickering.

284
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,385
>> Just like with the damn rice.

285
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,177
I said the rice is bad, don't

286
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,011
eat it.

287
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:14,804
>> You did not say the rice is

288
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:14,971
bad.

289
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,514
Shut up, dude.

290
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,265
If somebody said the rice was

291
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,099
bad, I wouldn't have eaten it.

292
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:18,975
>> The survivors searched

293
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,059
everywhere...

294
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,519
>> Yes, dig for dinner.

295
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,061
>> PROBST: ...for anything

296
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,396
remotely edible.

297
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,146
>> Have y'all eaten one of these

298
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,357
things?

299
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,154
>> It's like, "Hey, he'll try

300
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:32,947
it."

301
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,781
>> After eating frog, I guess

302
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,325
I'll eat anything, huh?

303
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,746
>> PROBST: At the first immunity

304
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,706
challenge, lack of food and

305
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,748
sleep didn't fare well for Zhan

306
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,042
Hu.

307
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:45,668
>> Yes!

308
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,669
>> PROBST: And Fei Long

309
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,713
prevailed.

310
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,923
Fei Long wins immunity!

311
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,842
That night, at tribal council,

312
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,177
Zhan Hu decided who was their

313
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,054
weakest link.

314
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:57,847
First person voted out of

315
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,808
<i>Survivor: China,</i> Chicken.

316
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,560
>> Damn!

317
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,185
>> PROBST: The next day at Fei

318
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,730
Long, Todd and Amanda formed an

319
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,023
alliance.

320
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,982
>> You're my long alliance, too.

321
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:08,774
>> Okay.

322
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,400
>> You have to have one in this

323
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,568
game.

324
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,610
You have to.

325
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,570
>> PROBST: And Aaron asserted

326
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,697
himself as the leader, calling

327
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,948
out Jean-Robert.

328
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,491
>> Jean-Robert, you need to

329
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,034
start pulling your weight.

330
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:18,784
>> I know that I'm not working

331
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,702
as much as I'd like to be able

332
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,703
to work.

333
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,581
My brain's working, but my

334
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,165
body's just not able to move

335
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,250
with it.

336
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,543
I wanted to give the perception

337
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,210
that I was a little bit lazy, so

338
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,921
later on when I am contributing

339
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,341
and putting in the work effort,

340
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,633
you know, people are noticing.

341
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,217
>> PROBST: But after a short

342
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,136
time, Aaron's actions caused

343
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,346
people to question his

344
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,265
leadership abilities.

345
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,412
>> I thought you were supposed

346
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:03,913
to be doing something.

347
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,706
I thought y'all were supposed to

348
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,124
be doing something.

349
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,084
We need to do the roof and get

350
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:08,918
some fire.

351
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,710
>> Yeah.

352
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,294
We tried and I couldn't do it.

353
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:10,836
>> So y'all going to stop?

354
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,546
Dude!

355
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,297
You're killing me.

356
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,131
>> Can you get fire?

357
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:14,965
Can you get fire?

358
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,758
>> You can.

359
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,300
We probably can together.

360
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,843
You're supposed to be the damn

361
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:18,761
leader.

362
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,221
Y'all are killing me.

363
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,722
Y'all are killing me.

364
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,932
The only reason why stuff gets

365
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,308
done is I don't want to sleep

366
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,476
on... get rained on.

367
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,060
I can't do all this stuff by

368
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:26,936
myself.

369
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,729
No, I'm not.

370
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,855
We're the only two to actually

371
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,940
do physical activity.

372
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,650
We've got a stewardess, we've

373
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,692
got two older ladies that don't

374
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,693
do much.

375
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,445
We've got a boy... he's a card

376
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,363
player, dude.

377
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,197
He came out here in Louis

378
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,115
Vittons.

379
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,533
>> James comes marching down

380
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,575
and, "Aaron, you're supposed to

381
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:41,867
be a leader.

382
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,743
You're supposed to be showing us

383
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,787
what to do, and you're down here

384
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,788
taking a nap."

385
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,789
And I'm, like, thinking he's

386
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,416
yelling at me at first.

387
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:48,999
I looked over at him, and he's

388
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,168
like, "You're just a flight

389
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,420
attendant.

390
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,546
I'm talking about him, our

391
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,463
leader."

392
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,047
And I was like, "Okay, let him

393
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,716
get ripped up," you know?

394
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,134
>> You have to help.

395
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:58,968
You have to help me out.

396
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,845
The rest of them, hey... you

397
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,846
need to get your ass up.

398
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,763
Come on.

399
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,389
There's just too much delegating

400
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:03,931
and a whole lot of nothing

401
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:04,890
getting done.

402
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,767
Now, I'm not going to do this by

403
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,768
myself anymore.

404
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,352
They're going to pull the rope

405
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,603
with me or they're all going to

406
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,354
die.

407
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,690
I'll move in that cave.

408
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,237
>> PROBST: Up next, Todd calls

409
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,114
out Jean-Robert.

410
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,282
>> Do you have a problem with

411
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,116
me, John-Robert?

412
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:22,491
>> Absolutely not.

413
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,117
>> That's not what I've heard.

414
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,493
>> Todd.

415
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,202
>> What?

416
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:25,870
>> First of all, fix your tone.

417
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,745
>> No.

418
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,413
>> Fix your tone.

419
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,290
>> No.

420
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,091
>> PROBST: At the next reward

421
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,342
challenge...

422
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:40,801
Go!

423
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,304
...Fei Long rolled to their

424
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,763
second straight victory...

425
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,098
Fei Long wins!

426
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,433
...and a major element of the

427
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,018
game was revealed.

428
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,644
Fei Long, because you defeated

429
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,521
Zhan Hu, you now get to kidnap

430
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,024
one member of their tribe.

431
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:55,858
That person will come and live

432
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,026
with you until the next immunity

433
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,903
challenge.

434
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,905
Who are you going to kidnap?

435
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,907
>> Jaime.

436
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,867
>> PROBST: There's one more

437
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,243
layer to this twist.

438
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:06,869
Jaime, this is for you.

439
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,247
It says, "Open in private."

440
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:10,998
When you get to their beach,

441
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,751
find a private spot and read it.

442
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,169
>> Okay.

443
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:15,920
>> PROBST: And if losing wasn't

444
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,631
bad enough, Zhan Hu was hit even

445
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,965
harder when they returned to

446
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:20,841
camp.

447
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,051
>> It looks like a natural

448
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,762
disaster hit our camp.

449
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,597
This is basically destroyed.

450
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,975
>> It was like somebody just

451
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,644
took all the water from every

452
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,187
ocean they could find and just

453
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,522
poured it right on top of us.

454
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,064
>> PROBST: And they quickly

455
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,358
devised a plan to restore their

456
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,109
camp.

457
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,528
>> I'm going in, I'm getting the

458
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,487
machete and I'm cutting a

459
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,488
channel.

460
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,531
>> Yeah, it was pretty

461
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,448
disheartening.

462
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,116
My first reaction was just, "Oh,

463
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,076
brother.

464
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:47,993
Here we go, something else to

465
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:48,911
worry about."

466
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,495
But, you know, when there's a

467
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,079
problem, you can only spend so

468
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,080
much time being worried about

469
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:51,997
it.

470
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,958
You really have to just, "All

471
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,000
right, let's fix it."

472
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,003
>> If you can at least cut

473
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,338
through some of those fibers and

474
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,006
those roots.

475
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,969
>> Oh, there you go, there you

476
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,470
go!

477
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,429
There it is.

478
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,347
>> Are they coming yet?

479
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,348
>> Yeah, it's starting.

480
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,266
>> Great effort.

481
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,684
We're digging channels, trying

482
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,851
to get our different plateaus to

483
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,811
drain.

484
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,853
We have three plateaus here at

485
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,938
our camp, and the top one's

486
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,147
draining into our living one,

487
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,441
which is draining into our

488
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,443
bamboo prep fields, which is

489
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,070
then tumbling two meters down

490
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,031
into the lake.

491
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,832
>> Hopefully, we'll be able to

492
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,000
get this really dry and finally

493
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,167
have a comfortable camp that's

494
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,252
not wet and muddy, so...

495
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,378
The water is actually starting

496
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,588
to flow now, so I think it's

497
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,047
actually working.

498
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,008
>> PROBST: That same day at Fei

499
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,885
Long, Jaime found a quiet place

500
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,138
to open the bamboo tube.

501
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,140
>> "In this sealed tube is a

502
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,349
clue to a hidden immunity idol

503
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,142
at the enemy camp.

504
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,728
You must give the sealed clue to

505
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,396
a member of the tribe."

506
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,731
My strategy, as far as the clue

507
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,940
goes, is I'm going to give it to

508
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,483
whom I think it is their weakest

509
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,027
link.

510
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,320
>> PROBST: In an attempt to be

511
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,738
strategic, Jaime gave the clue

512
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,030
to Leslie.

513
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:06,947
Don't let anybody know you have

514
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,741
it.

515
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,700
>> Okay.

516
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,326
I feel like the Lord really gave

517
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,161
me a gift.

518
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:12,953
>> PROBST: Leslie formed an

519
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,247
alliance of her own, hoping it

520
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,540
would help keep her in the game.

521
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,751
>> I told Todd the idol is here,

522
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,377
so we're going to team up and

523
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,129
use it together.

524
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,923
And I trust him.

525
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,675
>> I can't believe she told me.

526
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,135
I'm in shock!

527
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,219
I would never tell anybody.

528
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,889
What was she thinking?

529
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,019
>> PROBST: The next morning,

530
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,520
Aaron woke everyone up and

531
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:44,109
delivered some surprising news.

532
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,527
>> All right, so, making an

533
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,404
announcement.

534
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,197
It's been real, and it's been

535
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,073
fun, but it hasn't been real

536
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,116
fun.

537
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,326
>> I just can't stand all the

538
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,452
<i>Brady Bunch</i> antics that go on

539
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,119
in this tribe.

540
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,162
Aaron stood up this morning, put

541
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,206
on his little suit and jacket

542
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,459
with his little powwow.

543
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,043
Like, some of us haven't even

544
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,002
taken our heads off the bamboo

545
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,046
yet.

546
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,589
>> I am now relinquishing my

547
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,132
title as leader.

548
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,718
I can't continue to, like, keep

549
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,260
tabs on everyone else, and I

550
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,136
don't want to keep tabs on

551
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,054
everyone else.

552
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,014
But I've definitely enjoyed, you

553
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:14,556
know, helping out, you know,

554
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,934
with whatever advice I can give,

555
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,185
but I'm tired of making

556
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,853
decisions.

557
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,146
>> Aaron came up with this new

558
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,314
brilliant idea-- "I'm

559
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,065
relinquishing my leadership

560
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,942
position."

561
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,068
What?

562
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,027
>> All right, let's get some

563
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,987
fire.

564
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,280
so Amanda is on stairs.

565
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,573
Jean-Robert, you're going to do

566
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,157
logs with James later in the

567
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,992
day.

568
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,412
So does anyone know how to fish?

569
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,162
>> "No, I'm not the leader," and

570
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,666
right afterwards, he told us all

571
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,460
what to do.

572
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,965
>> PROBST: Over at Zhan Hu,

573
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:48,799
Dave's lack of sleep was

574
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,343
starting to affect him.

575
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,596
>> I'm up first primarily

576
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,098
because I got shuffled and

577
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,308
squeezed out of every

578
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,102
comfortable sleeping position

579
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,979
there is.

580
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:02,604
And if no one can see I'm the

581
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,064
tallest person around here,

582
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,442
that's starting to get under my

583
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,318
skin a little bit.

584
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,988
Hello.

585
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,698
You know?

586
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,658
>> PROBST: And Dave expressed

587
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,994
his views about eating before a

588
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:17,995
challenge.

589
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:18,787
>> We decided to do rice and

590
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,580
just a little bit so it will

591
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,330
boil faster.

592
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,165
We don't know how much time we

593
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,458
have to go before our challenge.

594
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,917
>> I'll tell you, man, eating

595
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,377
the rice right before a

596
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,045
challenge, I don't know.

597
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,005
I know that digestion diverts

598
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,590
all your energy to your stomach.

599
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,341
>> But we're all starving.

600
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,179
>> I'm... I'm... watch this.

601
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:39,016
Please, patience.

602
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:39,475
>> You're so dramatic.

603
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,351
>> Well, you know, I mentioned

604
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,645
this so many times.

605
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,938
And I have reasons for it.

606
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,939
>> I think it's better to eat

607
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:46,857
when you're starving before you

608
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,067
have to exert energy.

609
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,692
>> My physiology, my metabolism

610
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,109
is not yours.

611
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,612
Whatever you guys need to feel

612
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,946
better about it, if you feel

613
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,864
better after a meal, then by all

614
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,574
means, cook the rice.

615
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,034
>> If you don't want to eat,

616
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:57,326
that's...

617
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,328
Well, I don't think any of us

618
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:03,749
need to eat right now.

619
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,708
I just think it's smart to.

620
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,626
>> You guys know your bodies.

621
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,543
You guys start yourselves up.

622
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,419
I am not going to tell you what

623
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,295
to do, what not to do in that

624
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,213
respect.

625
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,672
>> Dave hasn't been eating.

626
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,965
He hasn't wanted to because he

627
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,466
says his energy is high.

628
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,301
He keeps telling everybody that

629
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,594
he somehow gets magical energy

630
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,096
from the air and he doesn't need

631
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,223
to eat.

632
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,557
I think he'd be smarter than

633
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,517
that.

634
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,434
>> Good things come to those who

635
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,310
wait.

636
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,645
I don't like doing things half-

637
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,729
assed.

638
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,647
>> PROBST: At the immunity

639
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,233
challenge, Dave ate his words,

640
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,693
causing Zhan Hu to lose.

641
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,695
Fei Long wins immunity!

642
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,032
When Zhan Hu returned to camp,

643
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:37,574
Dave knew he was in the hot

644
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,660
seat.

645
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,786
>> I apologize.

646
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,246
I feel like I let us down today.

647
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,497
>> Start the fire.

648
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,414
>> Let me finish.

649
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,415
>> In the fireplace.

650
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,500
>> Let me finish.

651
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,501
>> PROBST: And his constant

652
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,418
bickering with Ashley...

653
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,628
>> You're the leader, and I'm

654
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,337
going to let you do what you

655
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:50,546
want.

656
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,047
>> How many fires have you

657
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,756
built, sweetheart?

658
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,590
>> PROBST: ...put them both in

659
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,591
jeopardy.

660
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,759
At tribal council, Ashley ended

661
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,218
up getting the boot.

662
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,805
Ashley, the tribe has spoken.

663
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,852
The next morning at Fei Long,

664
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,311
Leslie cleaned up around camp.

665
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,378
>> Oh, they were?

666
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,505
Okay.

667
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:43,640
>> This morning, I woke up, and

668
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,433
I caught Leslie throwing away

669
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,268
our bait.

670
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,311
We caught it yesterday.

671
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,478
We needed that today to catch

672
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,813
the crabs and the fish.

673
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,064
And she thought there were too

674
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:51,648
many flies on it, so she threw

675
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,400
all our food away.

676
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,359
I was in shock.

677
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,320
I cannot believe how silly some

678
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,573
people can be.

679
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,786
>> Huh?

680
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,787
Huh?

681
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,246
Yeah.

682
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,331
>> And I'm really sorry, I threw

683
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,457
out those fish.

684
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,292
I didn't realize we were going

685
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:10,751
to use them for bait.

686
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,376
>> And tried to find them, and I

687
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,461
couldn't.

688
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,462
Here's what I'm going to do.

689
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,421
I know.

690
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,632
I have a learning curve.

691
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,216
I know.

692
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,176
You can yell at me.

693
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,636
You can scream at me.

694
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,803
I'm going to go down and try to

695
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,804
catch some more with the little

696
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,889
net, okay?

697
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,264
>> Uh-huh.

698
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,767
She wakes me up this morning and

699
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,392
tells me, "Oh, yeah, you need to

700
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,393
go fishing.

701
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,436
I'm like, "Cool, whatever."

702
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,271
"Oh, but I threw out the bait."

703
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,774
I don't understand that!

704
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,027
I mean, that's amazing.

705
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,320
I really would love to see how

706
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,488
these people would be without me

707
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,614
being here.

708
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,407
It would be hilarious, because

709
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,367
they honestly would be dead.

710
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,453
They'd be in the little boat

711
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,663
swimming, and would die of

712
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,789
thirst and hunger and just die

713
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,376
and float off in the river.

714
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,627
>> PROBST: At the next immunity

715
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,171
challenge....

716
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,591
>> Get that off my finger!

717
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,676
>> PROBST: Todd struggled with

718
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,760
the puzzle.

719
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,928
>> Move it from my face!

720
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:03,845
>> PROBST: Zhan Hu wins

721
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,348
immunity!

722
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,686
With Fei Long facing their first

723
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,980
tribal council, Jean-Robert

724
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,523
started placing blame on others.

725
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,482
>> What's on your mind regarding

726
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,317
today's challenge?

727
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,485
>> It's a strategy thing and we

728
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,528
messed it up.

729
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,737
It's that simple.

730
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,322
>> You know, you guys said we're

731
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,199
all promoting Todd to put the

732
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:24,783
things in, so I didn't want to

733
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,535
get in his way, but I handed

734
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,619
them all in the right places.

735
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,578
It was a matter of going up or

736
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,538
down.

737
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,789
You know, it wasn't that

738
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,790
complicated a puzzle.

739
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,791
>> Did you... did you realize

740
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,792
this and then...

741
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,794
>> I let Todd take the charge

742
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,878
and he was doing it, and it

743
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,921
looked like he was doing just

744
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,214
fine for a while.

745
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:39,798
>> Now Jean-Robert is spinning

746
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,465
it that Todd didn't do the

747
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,718
puzzle right, so it's always

748
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,094
someone else besides him.

749
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,888
But, like, I don't care.

750
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,224
I'll vote for snoreface

751
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:49,808
Jean-Robert because he annoys

752
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,061
the crap out of me.

753
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,657
>> Okay, I'm going to leave you

754
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,408
guys.

755
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,367
I just wanted to...

756
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,703
>> Yeah.

757
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:12,956
>> PROBST: And Todd became very

758
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,457
defensive.

759
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,333
>> You have a problem with me,

760
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:15,959
Jean-Robert, thinking I screwed

761
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,586
up the puzzle or something?

762
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,545
>> Absolutely not.

763
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,629
>> That's not what I've heard.

764
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,006
>> So what did you hear?

765
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:21,965
>> Someone said that you thought

766
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:22,924
that I screwed up the puzzle.

767
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,967
>> I didn't say any such thing.

768
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:24,843
>> You've got to watch your

769
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,594
mouth, dude.

770
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,428
Word gets around.

771
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,054
>> Todd, first of all, fix your

772
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,305
tone.

773
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,056
>> No.

774
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:29,931
>> Fix your tone.

775
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,724
>> Who said I said... James,

776
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,017
were you here?

777
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,934
Did I say he screwed up the

778
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:33,852
puzzle?

779
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,936
I'm asking you, James.

780
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,812
You were here.

781
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,605
Did I say he screwed up the

782
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,731
puzzle?

783
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,857
Amanda, did I say that Todd

784
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,900
screwed up the puzzle?

785
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,859
>> Amanda wasn't here.

786
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:41,943
She was with me, dude.

787
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,819
>> Aaron, did I say that Todd

788
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,653
screwed up the puzzle?

789
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,529
>> No.

790
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:44,863
>> Thank you.

791
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,239
So when you come confronting me,

792
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:46,990
make sure you know what you're

793
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:47,657
talking about.

794
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,450
>> That's why I came straight to

795
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,326
you, Jean-Robert.

796
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,035
>> Okay, but you came to me with

797
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:50,786
a tone.

798
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,661
>> Okay, well, wouldn't you?

799
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,746
>> Listen, we're all upset

800
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,914
because we lost a challenge.

801
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,915
>> Okay.

802
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,916
>> So all I'm saying is what

803
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,833
could we have done better?

804
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,459
You, absolutely, were not even

805
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,504
close to being one of the people

806
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,963
accountable for messing up

807
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:02,964
today.

808
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:03,965
>> All right, sorry for freaking

809
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:04,966
on you.

810
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,717
I just want to clear it out.

811
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,635
>> All right.

812
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,427
>> I get a little crazy like

813
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:07,719
that, okay?

814
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,596
>> Yeah, all right.

815
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,099
>> So, of course, I run back to

816
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,310
camp and kind of lose it on

817
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:15,977
Jean-Robert for a second, and I

818
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,561
wanted to put him in his place

819
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,480
and let him realize, "Yeah, you

820
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,941
know, I'm 150 pounds lighter

821
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,901
than you, dude, but I have a

822
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,152
very, very strong opinion, and

823
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,070
I'm going to knock you down if I

824
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,279
have to."

825
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:26,822
>> This team hates to lose.

826
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,490
>> Everybody gets kind of on

827
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,533
edge.

828
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,492
>> This team hates to lose.

829
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,952
That's one good thing.

830
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,537
>> PROBST: But at tribal

831
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,081
council, Fei Long kept Jean-

832
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,416
Robert for his strength.

833
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,543
Third person voted out of

834
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,836
<i>Survivor: China...</i>

835
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,545
And Leslie was voted out.

836
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,464
Up next:

837
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,383
>> If we lose, you're going

838
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:46,633
home.

839
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,551
That's not my call.

840
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,635
>> PROBST: Frosti gets handed an

841
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,678
ultimatum.

842
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,721
>> It's either we win and end up

843
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,639
going really far in the game or

844
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,851
lose and go home.

845
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,359
>> PROBST: By the morning of day

846
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,194
ten, Courtney had reached her

847
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,904
boiling point with Jean-Robert.

848
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:08,822
>> Don't touch that!

849
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,991
Don't touch that!

850
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:12,742
>> Okay, sorry.

851
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,703
I was afraid it might be hot.

852
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,746
>> He's, like, a cocky son of a

853
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,123
bitch, and he sucks so bad.

854
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,166
There's no getting out of that.

855
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,293
>> PROBST: Later that day at the

856
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,711
immunity challenge...

857
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,546
Sherea launches again!

858
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,464
...Sherea gave a brave

859
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,257
performance.

860
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,383
And scores!

861
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,593
But her efforts were not

862
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,677
enough...

863
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,596
James connects again.

864
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,597
...as Fei Long won another

865
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:33,889
challenge.

866
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,807
(<i> cheers</i> )

867
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,934
After another loss, Sherea and

868
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,019
Dave were at each other's

869
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,563
throats.

870
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,861
>> Sherea, please do not throw

871
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,738
those away.

872
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,074
>> I wish you would touch me.

873
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:53,700
I wish... I wish you would touch

874
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,576
me.

875
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,494
>> I'm saving some of these

876
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,370
shells.

877
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,121
>> Back up off me.

878
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:58,914
>> I'm saving...

879
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,706
>> Back up off of me.

880
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,124
>> Would you please...

881
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,083
>> Back up off of me.

882
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,126
>> If it were up to me, if we

883
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:03,752
could get rid of both of them,

884
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,837
it would be great.

885
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,546
>> Do not walk up on me again.

886
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,799
>> PROBST: And at tribal

887
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,759
council, Zhan Hu decided they'd

888
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,886
had enough of Dave.

889
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,804
Fourth person voted out of

>> PROBST: On day 13, another

893
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:23,855
twist was revealed.

894
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,815
>> Ah!

895
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,652
>> Fei Long, choose the two

896
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,986
warriors from Zhan Hu who you

897
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,446
feel could best help to

898
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:31,905
strengthen your tribe.

899
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,697

900
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,574
up.

901
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,034
Sherea and Frosti had to move to

902
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,869
the Fei Long tribe.

903
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:38,912

908
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,293
>> Hello.

909

>> PROBST: With the new tribes

910
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,379
in place, Fei Long took some

time to lighten things up around

912
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,631
camp.

913
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,175

>> I would have to say that...

917
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,016
that... that... that... winning

918
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,351
is... god, it's so good!

919
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,435

>> I don't even know how it

923
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:10,777
started, but we started doing

924
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,820
impressions.

925
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,364
And we did Jean-Robert, and how

926
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,824
he just likes to talk about

927
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,534
himself, and Todd stuck out his

928
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,995
belly, how Jean-Robert does.

929
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,454
And I was like, "Keep going,

930
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,455
don't stop."

931
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,331
This is what me and my friends

932
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:23,999
do at home.

933
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:24,666
We sit around and we jaw on each

934
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,542
other.

935
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,293
That means talk about each

936
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,002
other.

937
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:27,877
>> You guys...

938
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:28,837

939
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,130
together...

940
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,381
>> I'm kind of like liking you.

941
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,465
You're like, "Over on the other

942
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,092
side over there, we wasn't

943
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:34,718
eatin' anything.

944
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:39,597

to...

948
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,728
>> You put your one hand, and

949
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,522
you shake your ass.

950
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,440
>> People do say I walk like

951
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,193
that.

952
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,362
>> Denise-- "Oh, I don't care.

953
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,865
Everybody get in the car.

954
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,909
We go down to Salem, we get

955
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,244
ourselves some Bud.

956
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:01,745
I do some karate.

957
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,164
I just don't care.

958
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:09,210
At all, about anything."

959
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,299
>> Oh, my God.

960
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:14,841
>> Jeff...

961
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,719
(<i> laughter</i> )

962
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,138
"We're team Abercrombie and

963
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,681
Fitch, and you guys are all,

964
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,141
like, team you know, what's

965
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,393
left."

966
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,895
And then sometimes it's the one

967
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,481
eye, like, real open.

968
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,316
"Okay."

969
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,609
And the butt goes out more and

970
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:32,817
more.

971
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,236
It's the visible thinking.

972
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,363
That's what gets me.

973
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,614
It's, like, the visible thought

974
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,573
process.

975
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,616
And she's like... like when they

976
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,658
finish the challenges, she's

977
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,618
like... it gets, like, more

978
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,286
intense.

979
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,205
She's like, "I'm ready to go."

980
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,456
(<i> laughter</i> )

981
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,957
"I'm ready."

982
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,127
"Yo, when I compete, it's on."

983
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,297
With her little boobies and her

984
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:58,259
hot pink bikini, and she

985
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,594
bartends at a frat house.

986
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,261
And it's like, "Can I order you

987
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:00,762
online?

988
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,721
Like, aren't there ads for you

989
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,515
in the back of a magazine

990
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,474
somewhere?"

991
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:08,186
Like, come on.

992
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,354
>> PROBST: But over at Zhan Hu,

993
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,438
things were all business with

994
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,565
Jaime and Peih-Gee.

995
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:26,996
>> PROBST: At the immunity

996
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,831
challenge...

997
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,456
>> Boys, take your time and just

998
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,833
get your breath first.

999
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,000
Wait a minute.

1000
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,168
Wait a long minute.

1001
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,462
>> PROBST: Jaime and Peih-Gee's

1002
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,047
plan was set in motion.

1003
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,550
Fei Long wins immunity!

1004
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,009
And Aaron was the fifth person

1005
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,096
voted out of<i> Survivor: China.</i>

1006
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,349
The next day at the reward

1007
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,976
challenge...

1008
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,104
Fei Long wins reward.

1009
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,647
James was kidnapped by his old

1010
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,690
tribe.

1011
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,024
James, this is for you.

1012
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,111
Once back at Fei Long, James put

1013
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,238
his fate in Todd's hands.

1014
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,573
>> I know what they're talking

1015
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,949
about.

1016
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,033
It's those stupid bats above the

1017
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,618
freaking thing.

1018
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,828
>> PROBST: Todd and Amanda found

1019
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,664
the hidden immunity idol, but

1020
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,583
Frosti unexpectedly got

1021
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:11,875
involved.

1022
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,917
>> Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1023
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,919
All I could think was "Frosti,

1024
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,504
Frosti, no."

1025
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,797
So Todd and Amanda came up with

1026
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,549
a new plan for James to take the

1027
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,217
immunity idol and throw the next

1028
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,719
challenge in order to save

1029
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,888
himself.

1030
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,016
>> If you're running, trip.

1031
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,435
James loses immunity.

1032
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,645
They vote for him, but he uses

1033
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,938
the idol to get rid of Jaime.

1034
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,107
>> PROBST: Then Todd told James

1035
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,650
about the second hidden immunity

1036
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,486
idol at the Zhan Hu camp.

1037
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,820
>> All I have to do is stay

1038
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,405
focused, get the other idol and

1039
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:42,989
then I'll have both of them.

1040
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:43,948
I mean, it's going to be

1041
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:44,824
wonderful.

1042
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,285
I'm having a great time.

1043
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,036
>> PROBST: But with Frosti now

1044
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,038
in the mix, Todd and Amanda had

1045
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,456
to make a foolproof plan.

1046
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,333
>> People have said if we lose,

1047
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,709
you're going home.

1048
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,793
That's not my call.

1049
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,795
So, I mean, it will... it will

1050
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,589
help, though, for you to fight

1051
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,424
even harder to win, because it's

1052
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,884
either win and end up going

1053
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,637
really far in the game, or lose

1054
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,055
and go home.

1055
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:07,931
Do you know what I mean?

1056
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:08,932
And I like you way too much to

1057
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:09,974
send you home.

1058
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:10,600
>> We're not trying to blackmail

1059
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:10,934
you.

1060
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,769
>> I promise I'm not.

1061
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,561
I promise I'm not trying to play

1062
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,646
godfather.

1063
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,730
I like you way too much to watch

1064
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:16,231
you go 11th place, dude.

1065
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,608
Way too much.

1066
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,984
If we lose today, Frosti knows

1067
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,736
he's going home, because he saw

1068
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,154
the hidden immunity idol, and he

1069
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,281
knows our plan now, so we had to

1070
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,699
throw that blackmail in his face

1071
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,283
and say "Look, this is how it

1072
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,076
is.

1073
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,745
You have an ultimatum-- win and

1074
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,372
stay, lose, go home."

1075
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,498
>> How do you feel right now?

1076
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,083
>> Yeah, you look kind of

1077
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,334
dumbstruck.

1078
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,128
>> Well, I mean, you know I have

1079
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,004
to be on your side.

1080
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:40,255
>> Yeah.

1081
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,798
I trust you now, because...

1082
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,590
(<i> laughter</i> )

1083
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,508
>> That makes me sound horrible.

1084
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,052
>> We blackmailed Frosti because

1085
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,345
we don't want him giving any

1086
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,763
information to Zhan Hu today,

1087
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,390
and with Frosti helping us win

1088
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,350
as much as he can, and James

1089
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,394
helping Zhan Hu lose as much as

1090
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,729
he can, I'm pretty confident

1091
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,772
that we'll win the challenge

1092
00:30:57,855 --> 00:31:00,233
today.

1093
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,442
>> PROBST: At the immunity

1094
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,027
challenge...

1095
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,195
Go.

1096
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,238
...Frosti put his best foot

1097
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,364
forward in an effort to stay in

1098
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,574
the game.

1099
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,075
Frosti, he's licking the plate.

1100
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,327
Fei Long scores!

1101
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,329
These are chicken fetuses.

1102
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,206
Go.

1103
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,001
James spitting it back up.

1104
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,044
Denise is struggling.

1105
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,212
But Denise couldn't get her head

1106
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,839
around the task...

1107
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,923
>> Sorry, James.

1108
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,091
>> PROBST: ...ruining James'

1109
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,093
and Todd's perfect plan.

1110
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,305
>> I got it.

1111
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,180
>> Chew it!

1112
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:31,931
>> That's right, baby.

1113
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:32,557
>> PROBST: James puts it all in

1114
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,057
his mouth.

1115
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,935
James scores for Zhan Hu.

1116
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,395
>> Genius idea.

1117
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,772
Smashed.

1118
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,274
>> PROBST: That night at tribal

1119
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,109
council, Frosti's ongoing

1120
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,320
loyalty paid off.

1121
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,113
Sixth person voted out of

1122
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,115
<i>Survivor: China.</i>

1123
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,618
And Sherea was voted out.

1124
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,661
Even though James and Todd's

1125
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,121
plan didn't pan out, James'

1126
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,873
spirits were up when he found

1127
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,207
the second hidden immunity idol.

1128
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,167
>> That's funny.

1129
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,169
I'm on<i> Survivor</i> with two idols.

1130
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,173
>> PROBST: Later that day, Jaime

1131
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,049
and Erik found a discarded

1132
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,009
plaque that James had left

1133
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,844
behind.

1134
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:11,596

it off.

gone.

something.

decided to do some snooping.

1160
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:55,556
But in the dark, she was unable

1161

your boy?

1320
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:52,979
Nobody told me, bro.

1321
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,105
...is the realization that

1322
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,147
you're holding out on me.

1323
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,149
That's what I came up with.

1324
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:00,861
>> PROBST: Jean-Robert came up

1325
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:01,404
with a plan to take out his

1326
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,823
closest ally.

1327
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,533
We could blindside him tonight,

1328
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,160
because he will not pull out the

1329
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,078
idol tonight.

1330
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:09,954
>> Let's see how it goes

1331
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:10,871
tonight.

1332
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,081
I was kind of bothered by the

1333
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,582
fact he's coming up with all

1334
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,834
these ideas that I've had for

1335
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,876
days now.

1336
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,752
>> PROBST: But Todd turned the

1337
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,004
tables on Jean-Robert.

1338
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,840
>> I think our best bet is...

1339
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:21,966
>> I don't want to break the

1340
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:22,800
system, but...

1341
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,592
>> Do we want to tell Denise or

1342
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,343
no?

1343
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,469
>> No-- hell no!

1344
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,637
>> PROBST: But at tribal

1345
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,805
council, James took the risk of

1346
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,389
not using one of his idols...

1347
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,808
James.

1348
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,184
...and almost paid the price.

1349
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,436
James received three votes.

1350
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,854
One vote left.

1351
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,605
But in the end, Jean-Robert with

1352
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,024
five votes was dealt a losing

1353
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,317
hand.

1354
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,401
Jean-Robert, the tribe has

1355
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,528
spoken.

1356
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,993
At the reward challenge, Peih-

1357
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,496
Gee was captain of the red team,

1358
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,331
Erik captain of the yellow.

1359
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,042
Go.

1360
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,877
Peih-Gee's team dropped the

1361
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,128
ball.

1362
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,337
James, too hard, Peih-Gee can't

1363
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,839
get it.

1364
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,007
And Erik's team bounced to

1365
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,924
victory.

1366
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:04,550
Frosti, Amanda, Erik, and

1367
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,677
Courtney, cruising down the

1368
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,054
river.

1369
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,096
>> All right, everyone, cheers

1370
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,097
to us.

1371
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,098
>> PROBST: During the cruise,

1372
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,975
Courtney grew closer to Frosti.

1373
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,895
>> I love my Frosti.

1374
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,188
I love my Frosti.

1375
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,314
>> PROBST: Back at camp,

1376
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,565
Peih-Gee blamed James for losing

1377
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,525
the challenge.

1378
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,117
That's why y'all lose.

1379
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,368
You're quick to blame.

1380
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,578
>> Mm-hmm.

1381
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,621
>> I can finish?

1382
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,622
Can I please finish?

1383
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,414
>> No, you can't, because I

1384
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:35,706
don't care.

1385
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,208
>> You know, I need to take a

1386
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,585
walk right now.

1387
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,544
>> Peih-Gee, she's just stupid.

1388
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,798
>> PROBST: After she cooled off,

1389
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,008
Peih-Gee tried to make amends.

1390
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,433
>> No, you're not.

1391
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:54,767
Don't politic.

1392
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,476
>> I'm not politicking.

1393
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,477
I'm apologizing.

1394
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,561
So you can accept it or you're

1395
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,604
not, but I really am sorry,

1396
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,356
okay?

1397
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,148
>> No, you're not.

1398
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:01,899
You're really not.

1399
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:02,691
>> Please stop messing with me

1400
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,609
and go sit down somewhere else.

1401
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,693
>> No, I came up to apologize.

1402
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,569
I didn't come out to fight with

1403
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,529
you some more, okay?

1404
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,488
>> Well, obviously, you did.

1405
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,739
>> You know what?

1406
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,241
Listen, that's cool.

1407
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,408
You're not in the mood to accept

1408
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:11,909
my apology, that's fine.

1409
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,661
I can understand that.

1410
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,413
>> I know what kind of person

1411
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,539
You are, and this is just a

1412
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,540
bunch of fluff, and I really

1413
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,499
don't like fluff.

1414
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,458
I'm not a fluff person.

1415
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,584
>> James....

1416
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,795
>> I'm really not.

1417
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,921
>> After losing the reward

1418
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:24,922
challenge, I was really pissed

1419
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:25,589
to have lost, but I shouldn't

1420
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,716
have taken it out on James.

1421
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,051
So, I don't know.

1422
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:29,969
I'm in, like, a really bad

1423
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,680
position.

1424
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,722
>> PROBST: But at the immunity

1425
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,099
challenge...

1426
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,308
Peih-Gee wins immunity.

1427
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:36,642
>> Oh, my God!

1428
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,685
>> PROBST: ...Peih-Gee narrowly

1429
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,728
beats Frosti.

1430
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,021
With Peih-Gee immune, the former

1431
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,690
Fei Long saw Frosti as the

1432
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,234
biggest threat.

1433
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,193
>> He's got to go before Erik.

1434
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,404
>> Has to go.

1435
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,658
>> PROBST: And Todd tried to

1436
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,785
sway Courtney's decision.

1437
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,499
>> Frosti's kind of like my

1438
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:00,875
little munchkin.

1439
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,625
And everyone's kind of worried

1440
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,919
about me because they know he's,

1441
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:04,712
you know, like, my good friend.

1442
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,630
>> PROBST: That night at tribal

1443
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,756
council...

1444
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,216
Ninth person voted out and the

1445
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,676
third member of our jury...

1446
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,261
...Todd's efforts paid off.

1447
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,764
Frosti, the tribe has spoken.

1448
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,974
All right.

1449
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:17,975
Tonight, you will not be heading

1450
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,643
directly back to camp.

1451
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,607
We have more business to attend

1452
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,484
to here.

1453
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:36,911
>> PROBST: Where 16 once stood,

1454
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,371
only seven remain.

1455
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:39,997
How will James choose to use his

1456
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,833
two immunity idols?

1457
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,501
>> I have the big joker and the

1458
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,127
little joker, so I'm going to be

1459
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:45,753
here for a while, so you might

1460
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,670
as well go on and get

1461
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,630
comfortable.

1462
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,506
>> PROBST: What new adventures

1463
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,341
will the survivors face?

1464
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,217
What future twist will the

1465
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,051
challenges bring?

1466
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:52,968
Today, you are playing for....

1467
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:53,719
>> What?

1468
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,261
>> PROBST: Join us as the

1469
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,805

directly back to camp.

1482
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:18,327
A twist at tribal council

1483
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,328
catches everyone off guard.

1484
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,287
We have more business to attend

1485
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:20,663
to here.

1486
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,123
And Amanda turns on her

1487
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:29,380
alliance.

1488
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,464
>> Fei Long is not together

1489
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,466
anymore.

1490
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:37,846
>> That is not a new style for

1491
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,806
Denise.

1492
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,475
I believe that the USA hockey

1493
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:43,060
team is missing a player.

1494
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,144
I mean, the flight attendant

1495
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:44,937
voice is getting to me.

1496
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,063
You can almost hear everyone

1497
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:46,855
opening their little bag of

1498
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:47,606
peanuts every time he says

1499
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,607
something.

1500
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,401
Peih-Gee seems kind of smug,

1501
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,819
like, "Yum, I love me some pig

1502
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,112
knuckles."

1503
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:53,946
