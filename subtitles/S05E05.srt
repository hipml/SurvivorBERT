JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:06,047
<i>At Chuay Gahn,</i>
<i>Ted and Ghandia were no longer</i>

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,091
<i>on speaking terms,</i>
<i>following their confrontation.</i>

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,093
The relationship between
Ghandia and I

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,177
<i>is nonexistent.</i>

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,887
<i>I only see five people on</i>
<i>this island.</i>

7
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,098
PROBST:<i> Their rift divided</i>
<i>the tribe along gender lines.</i>

8
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,767
HELEN:
<i>I do believe Ghandia's story.</i>

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,269
<i>The guys will believe</i>
<i>Ted's side.</i>

10
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,604
PROBST:<i> Stephanie was</i>
<i>on the outs with Sook Jai.</i>

11
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,064
STEPHANIE:
<i>They got rid of Jed.</i>

12
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,315
Piss on them.

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,275
SHII ANN:<i> I don't know</i>
<i>what Stephanie's problem is.</i>

14
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,277
<i>Honestly,</i>
<i>I think she just feels</i>

15
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,278
-like we're all idiots.
-Go!

16
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,613
PROBST:
<i>At the reward challenge,</i>

17
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,240
<i>Sook Jai's physical strength</i>

18
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>secured them another victory.</i>

19
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,662
<i>Along with it</i>
<i>came bananas and chickens.</i>

20
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,122
We're going to check
for eggs every day,

21
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,790
and I expect there to be eggs!

22
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,459
PROBST:
<i>Sook Jai also won immunity.</i>

23
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,627
-Sook Jai wins immunity!
-Sook Jai!

24
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,755
Yeah!

25
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,922
PROBST:
<i>Back at Chuay Gahn,</i>

26
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,133
<i>Ghandia wanted the women</i>
<i>to vote for Clay.</i>

27
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,801
But here's where I'm thinking
with this.

28
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,136
If we keep the girls together,
then we have a leverage

29
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,014
-of a three-to-two vote.
-Mm-hmm. All right.

30
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,390
I will be so happy tonight
if Clay is gone.

31
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,269
PROBST:<i> But Helen was torn</i>
<i>between her loyalty to Ghandia</i>

32
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,812
<i>and her desire</i>
<i>to play the game.</i>

33
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,481
HELEN:<i> I want to play,</i>
<i>but it would mean</i>

34
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,149
<i>voting Ghandia off tonight.</i>

35
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,486
Honestly, right now,
I'm still betwixt and between.

36
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,780
PROBST:<i> In the end,</i>
<i>gender lines broke down.</i>

37
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,199
<i>Helen jumped ship, voting</i>
<i>Ghandia out of the tribe.</i>

38
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,450
Tribe has spoken.

39
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,285
<i>12 are left.</i>

40
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,622
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

41
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,613
Here, I'll put it back
in the same place.

42
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,250
CLAY:<i> We had a very interesting</i>
<i>Tribal Council.</i>

43
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,294
<i>Little bit of a shocker.</i>
<i>Now, we knew that Jan</i>

44
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,254
<i>was being manipulated</i>
<i>by, uh, Ghandia,</i>

45
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,299
<i>but we didn't know just...</i>
<i>just how much.</i>

46
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,259
Why the hell
did she vote for me?

47
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,304
That, uh, didn't make
a whole lot of sense.

48
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,098
<i>Her head's the one that's got</i>
<i>the "X" on it the next time.</i>

49
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,600
<i>She's the next one to go.</i>

50
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,938
JAN:
<i>Uh, I voted for Clay.</i>

51
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,773
<i>Clay will know it's me,</i>
<i>and he doesn't</i>

52
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,484
forgive or forget,
so I know I'm next to go.

53
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,612
<i>Helen said she was going</i>

54
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,405
<i>to vote for Clay,</i>
<i>but she did not.</i>

55
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>It's her vote--</i>
<i>she can choose to change it,</i>

56
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,076
<i>and I think she changed it.</i>

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,494
BRIAN:
It's been a long day.

58
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,954
(loud yawning)

59
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,289
HELEN:
<i>I know the gir... the girls</i>

60
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,791
<i>are gonna think I betrayed</i>
<i>them, and I'm just gonna</i>

61
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,500
<i>have to live with that, but...</i>

62
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,836
<i>it was... one of those</i>

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,129
necessary evils.

64
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,340
Had to be done,
but it wasn't enjoyable to do.

65
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,758
And, um...

66
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,594
<i>if that gets me further</i>
<i>ahead, then so be it.</i>

67
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,648
(chickens clucking)

68
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,279
(rooster crowing)

69
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,031
(chickens clucking)

70
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,367
PENNY:<i> We had already decided</i>
<i>that when we woke up,</i>

71
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>as soon as we</i>
<i>heard the rooster crow,</i>

72
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,663
<i>we were gonna get up</i>
<i>and we were gonna</i>

73
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,207
eat, you know, one
of the chickens this morning.

74
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,542
(chickens clucking, squawking)

75
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,170
JAKE: Steph, if you hold it,
I'll kill it, okay?

76
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,964
STEPHANIE:
All right.

77
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,597
(cracking)

78
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,809
STEPHANIE:
<i>I got up and grabbed him and...</i>

79
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,728
and held him while Jake, you
know, broke his neck, and then

80
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,355
<i>we proceeded</i>
<i>to, uh, boil the pot of water</i>

81
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,233
<i>and put him in there</i>
<i>to loosen the feathers up</i>

82
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,484
<i>and pluck the feathers</i>
<i>out of him...</i>

83
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,945
<i>Then we just boiled him</i>
<i>for, like, an hour.</i>

84
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,879
Mmm, he smells good!

85
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,547
He smells great.

86
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,008
Everybody come dive in.

87
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,384
Oh, my gosh.

88
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,678
Pull a piece off,
or however you want to do it.

89
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,223
JAKE: We thank you
for giving your life,

90
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,516
Mr. Bird, but, boy,

91
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,560
I tell you what,
you sure do taste good.

92
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,895
Mmm, mmm!

93
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,064
SHII ANN:
<i>It was so tasty.</i>

94
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,191
<i>It was probably--</i>
<i>I mean, it was so tough,</i>

95
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,193
<i>it was like eating leather</i>
<i>a little bit,</i>

96
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:19,902
but it was
the best-tasting chicken

97
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,196
I've ever had in my entire life.

98
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,490
Guys, it doesn't get
any better than this.

Oh, my God.

100
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,785
Who said they wanted the liver?

101
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,911
I'll eat the heart
and the liver.

102
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,413
ROBB:<i> Shii Ann had a piece,</i>
<i>and she ate</i>

103
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,250
<i>lungs and intestines and necks</i>
<i>and picked the bones</i>

104
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,543
<i>so that there's nothing left.</i>
<i>I don't know,</i>

105
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,628
her eating habits
are just repulsive.

106
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,137
This has got to be the best.

107
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,430
<i>She licks her fingers</i>
<i>too much,</i>

108
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,223
<i>then tries... reaches back in</i>
<i>and grabs stuff</i>

109
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:49,724
<i>while everybody else is eating.</i>

110
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,060
She's just gross.

111
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,686
Robb, if you want
to try some of the neck,

112
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,937
there's a lot
of meat around it.

113
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,314
Yech!

114
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,857
SHII ANN:
<i>Culturally, it's not</i>

115
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,276
<i>an American thing to eat, like,</i>

116
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,446
<i>necks and hearts and gizzards</i>
<i>and stuff like that.</i>

117
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,906
Most people
don't eat that stuff.

118
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,409

<i>I grew up partly in Taiwan.</i>

122
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,250
<i>In Taiwan, it's considered</i>
<i>a great snack.</i>

123
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,627
-The neck is gone; I ate it.
-ROBB: You ate the whole neck?

124
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,338
Yeah, it was good.

125
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,145
Crabs are very slim.

126
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,480
It's horrible.
I don't see 'em running.

127
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,606
I mean, you don't...
you don't even see any.

128
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,650
I mean, that's, you know,
if I could see 'em

129
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,277
just running off,
at least I'd know there's

130
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,155
some out there, but right now I
don't even see any running off.

131
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,491

Boy, I would like...

133
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,662
I would like one, just a little
bit of that taste right now.

of the nice chicken

204

<i>that blood was kind of</i>

213

<i>coming out of his foot.</i>

214

Something...
okay, the wave came,

215
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,847

and when my foot went back,

216
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,683
something came and bit me.
I don't know

217
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,019
what out there has
a mouth big enough to bite me

218
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,687
and put a mark like this on me,
but it was sharp,

219
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,063

whatever it was.

purple tinge around it.

Throwing a little

Mm-hmm.

00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,864
There must be a reasonable
explanation for all of this.

I had her nice and secure,
tight, too.

289

Inside of it was our net, too.

290

The tide must have
washed it way up.

those rocks, right there.

-I have no idea.

go way up there.

just floated the boat.

<i>If we don't find that boat,</i>

hungrier and hungrier
for that meat.

304
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,945
So that means no Betsy,
that means no net.

-Only thing I can think of

if that twine floats.

Hey, Magilla, what's
the deal with the boat, man?

334

Why are you always
stealing stuff?

Talk to me. Why?

336
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,353
I mean, we didn't
do anything to you--

It's an auction; buying food.

PROBST:
Gonna have a little fun today.

391
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,259
But before we get to the auction
I'm gonna make you an offer.

392
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,762
Before I make the offer,
I want you to hear me clearly.

393
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,057
Do not speak for 60 seconds.

394
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,308
When the 60 seconds is up,

395
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,810
I'll then ask you
for a response.

396
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,479
Clear? No talking.

397
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,481
Here's the offer.

398
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,357
Does anybody here...

399
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,193
want to switch tribes?

400
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,825
Does any one person

401
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,620
from one tribe
want to switch with another?

402
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,209
Think about this; this is
an individual decision.

403
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,629
One of those forks in the road.

404
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,633
Chance to change your fate
or stay where you are.

405
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,019
Okay.

406
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,897
Sook Jai, I'll start with you--
anybody on Sook Jai

<i>I was so tempted</i>
<i>to switch tribes, so tempted.</i>

412
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,663
PENNY:<i> My immediate</i>
<i>reaction was, like,</i>

413
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,706
<i>"I've got to do this,"</i>
<i>you know.</i>

414
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,042
<i>I was looking</i>

415
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,419
<i>really wanting to go,</i>

416
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,713
I take that as a no.

417
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,216
Chuay Gahn,

418
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,176

HELEN:
<i>Hmm, thought about it.</i>

421
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,016
<i>I'm gonna stay where I am.</i>
<i>But if I were Jan,</i>

JAN:
<i>I'm gonna stick with my tribe.</i>

were given a thousand dollars
U.S. currency.

433
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,079
You can spend it as you like,

434
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,247
but you'll be bidding
as a tribe.

435

The auction will stop suddenly
and without warning.

There is a limited
number of items.

437
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,255
You can get greedy;
you can get conservative.

<i>the last couple of days.</i>

612
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,482
<i>She's been around the tribe</i>
<i>a little bit more,</i>

613
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,317
<i>and she's been more helpful.</i>

614
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,194
And she's wanted
to participate

615
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,988
in all the things
that we do.

616
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,115
<i>I think Stephanie</i>

617
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,825
<i>a little bit concerned about</i>

618
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:21,579
<i>where she does stand in this</i>
<i>tribe, so maybe she is trying</i>

619
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,832

STEPHANIE:
<i>You know, just because</i>

621
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,170

I mean, I'm not like that
a whole lot anyway.

624
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,801
<i>The reason that there's...</i>
<i>I think, the niceness</i>

<i>is being spread around is,</i>

626
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,179
<i>'cause everyone's not</i>
<i>starving to death.</i>

627
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,017
I mean, to starve
to death will make you an ass.

628
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,767
I mean, it will.

00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,936
<i>We just have</i>
<i>to basically suck it up and</i>

661
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,897
do what we have to do
as far as getting our water,

662
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,899
which is to swim over
to the hole and then back.

663
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,992
HELEN:<i> There was a little bit</i>
<i>of talk about, "Oh, you sure?</i>

664
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,078
<i>You can wait till tomorrow."</i>
<i>I'm like,</i>

665
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,287
<i>"No, we can't wait</i>
<i>till tomorrow.</i>

666
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,455
<i>"We're out of water, and</i>

667
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,998
<i>we don't know</i>
<i>what our challenge is today."</i>

668
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,835
If nothing else,
we have got to stay hydrated.

669
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,676
-Jellyfish.
-HELEN: Yech!

670
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,470
Well, at least there ain't
no sharks, yet.

671
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,848
HELEN:<i> I would prefer</i>
<i>to have the boat, but I</i>

672
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,932
can swim over to get water.

673
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,101
My only fear is,

674
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,145
<i>you got to make sure</i>
<i>you don't swim</i>

675
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,771
<i>and exhaust yourself</i>
<i>for a challenge,</i>

676
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:56,651
<i>'cause you never know.</i>

677
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,446
HELEN:
I don't want anybody

678
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,490
cutting back so much on water
they're getting dizzy.

679
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,616
BRIAN:
No, definitely.

680
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,868
-Especially with the stuff we
got coming up. -Yeah.

681
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,163
BRIAN:
<i>Immunity we must win.</i>

682
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,928
PROBST:
Come on in, guys.

683
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,850
First things first. Stephanie,
bring me that immunity idol.

684
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,436
I know it feels good.

685
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,357
Immunity back up for grabs.

686
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,861
For today's immunity challenge,
you're going to be sorting fish.

687
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,361
A whole lot of fish.

688
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,988
Thousands of fish.

689
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,573
All this fish came
from right out here

690
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,201
in the Andaman Sea
off that fishing boat.

691
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,035
There are four different types:

692
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,579
Got your Barramundi,

693
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,332
your Trevally.

694
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,043
You guys are very familiar
with this one-- squid.

695
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,545
And a cute little local fish

696
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,048
that we're calling
the little silver fish.

697
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,591
Four different types of fish.

698
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:05,220
Your job-- sort the fish
into their respective bins.

699
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,555
Every fish must be sorted,

700
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,891
and every fish
must be in the right bin.

701
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,768
The winning tribe goes home
with immunity.

702
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,894
Cannot be voted out. Losers--

703
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,272
back to Tribal Council,
and for somebody else,

704
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,441
this game is over tonight.

705
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,401
Sook Jai, because you have
two extra members,

706
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,029
you're sitting two people out.
You picked Erin and Ken.

707
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,740
Everybody else get ready,
wait for my go.

708
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,408
Immunity at stake.
Survivors ready?

709
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,451
-Yes.
-JAN: Yes. -Go!

710
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,056
ERIN:
Come on, guys, you can do it!

711
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,440
PROBST:
That is an effort,

712
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,275
Stephanie, I got to say.

713
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,569
Catch a fish.
Oh, watch out, Brian.

714
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,195
-BRIAN: Clay, you got to watch
it. -PROBST: Nice shot, Clay.

715
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,405
BRIAN:
Clay, in the bucket, man.

716
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,781
They're all over the ground.

717
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:09,075
You're making me do double work.

718
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,414
TED:
Don't worry about me, man.

719
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,291
I got... I'm on a roll.

720
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,085
Just do your fish.

721
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,509
BRIAN: Ted, we're running low
on big fish.

722
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,012
CLAY:
Don't forget your fish.

723
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,235
JAN:
Come on.

724
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,820
-Come on, guys. Come on...
-Going for the small fish.

725
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:46,571
-Come on, come on. -I'm gonna
drop. Watch-Watch your back.

726
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,156
Come on, guys.
Guys, let's go.

727
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,365
-Let's go. Get it!
-Watch your back.

728
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,789
PROBST:
Good eyes, Robb.

729
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,667
You guys are not going to want
to dig around in this sand.

730
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,920
Don't think I'm not watching,
'cause I am.

731
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,008
PENNY:
Keep working, y'all.

732
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,843
TED: Come on, Jan.
Y-You're dropping some.

733
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,136
JAN: I got it, I got it.
I've got it.

734
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,473
Grab the ice. Grab...

735
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,391
CLAY:
Watch how many you drop.

736
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,145
-Check, check!
-Is that it?

737
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,355
-Check, check, check.
-Is that it?

738
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,857
-Check, check, check, check.
-Check, check, check, check.

739
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,359
-Check area. Check area.
-Check, check.

740
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,819
-Check.
-Check area.

741
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,321
Get it, get it, get it,
get it, get it!

742
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,530
Got one.

743
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,032
-TED: Check, check.
-JAN: Get it in there.

744
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,158
-TED: Check, check, check.
-Check.

745
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,035
-Check area.
-Talk to me.

746
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,036
-Talk to me. Talk to me.
-Finished.

747
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,204
-Finished.
-Finished!

748
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,122
One of your fish is not sorted
correctly.

749
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,207
It's sitting out there waiting
to be discovered.

750
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,042
-I'll check the squid.
-PROBST: Still alive,

751
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,211
Sook Jai. Chuay Gahn's
missing a fish.

752
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,755
PENNY: Come on, keep working.
Pass.

753
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,219
-There, right there.
-That's what I'm looking for.

754
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,221
-Chuay Gahn wins immunity!
-CLAY: Yeah!

755
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,181
-TED: Yeah!
-HELEN: Oh!

756
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,434
CLAY:
We get fish out of it, too.

757
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,394
Okay, let's go.

758
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,688
-One, two three. Chuay Gahn!
-Chuay Gahn!

759
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,897
-Chuay Gahn!
-Thank you, God.

760
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,232
Boy, did we do that one!

761
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,567
Yes! Yes!

762
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,902
Chuay Gahn! Yes!

763
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:09,278
-Chuay Gahn, who wants this?
-I'll take it.

764
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,240
PROBST: Chuay Gahn, you guys
can head back to camp.

765
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,242
Sook Jai, see you guys tonight
at Tribal Council.

766
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,578
Somebody's going home.

767
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,934
SHII ANN: So, who's your
favorite on the other team?

768
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,102
When you looked over?

769
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,438
-They all seem really nice.
-Don't they?

770
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,231
STEPHANIE:
<i>When we had the 60 seconds</i>

771
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,816
<i>of silence</i>
<i>where we could decide</i>

772
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,276
<i>whether we wanted</i>
<i>to jump tribes, I wish I had.</i>

773
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,903
I would have a better chance
over there,

774
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,114
and I think that I would have
more fun over there.

775
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,657
I really do.

776
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,950
<i>Everybody is kind of</i>

777
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:58,119
<i>pretty much blah around here,</i>
<i>and I pretty much</i>

778
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,287
<i>feel as like</i>
<i>they're out to get me.</i>

779
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,166
<i>I could be wrong,</i>
<i>but I feel like I'm next.</i>

780
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,007
ERIN:
<i>Things are going pretty well.</i>

781
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,635
<i>The only kind of dysfunction</i>
<i>we have going on right now</i>

782
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,971
<i>is with Shii Ann.</i>

783
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,347
<i>And I don't even think</i>
<i>she really knows that</i>

784
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,309
we even really have that much of
a dysfunction going on with her.

785
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,020
ERIN:
I can't believe it.

786
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,022
She doesn't use her head.
She doesn't think.

787
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,982
ROBB: The most upsetting thing
about it is, like,

788
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:30,318
at the reward we had utensils,
and she was using her fingers.

789
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,652
It's just disgusting.

790
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,321
Like, all of us have enough
manners not to do that.

791
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,822
ROBB:
It's appalling, dude.

792
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,990
She's a girl, too.

793
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,325
-Give me a break, dude.
-I know.

794
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,826
Who the hell would
take her home?

795
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,328
JAKE:
<i>I don't know what it is that</i>

796
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,663
Shii Ann does
that irritates other people,

797
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,831
but it's something.

798
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,708
ROBB: It's funny 'cause Ken says
she's a city girl,

799
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,876
and they're all like her.

800
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,169
I don't ever want to meet
another New York City girl.

801
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,838
ERIN: Oh, God, me, neither.
She just bugs me so much.

802
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,381
I can't wait to get rid of her.

803
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,591
JAKE:<i> She doesn't irritate me,</i>
<i>and the reason</i>

804
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,343
<i>she doesn't irritate</i>
<i>me is because she works,</i>

805
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,720
and Shii Ann to me is just one

806
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,348
of the all-time good ones
as far as that goes.

807
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,183
We've had one hell
of an experience,

808
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,519
and we got a lot more days
to go.

809
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,063
-This is a third of the way
through it. -Yup.

810
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,898
So you can't let
your dauber get down.

811
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,358
You just have to keep going.

812
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,859
And when people look like

813
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,860
they're over there
talking about it,

814
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,154
when you think
they're conniving against you,

815
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,864
here's what you got to do.

816
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,200
You got to say,
"Man, those people like me.

817
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,869
"Look at them, they're over
there talking about me.

818
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,496
They're talking about
how wonderful I am."

819
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,914
-You do that...
-Yeah?

820
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,374
...you'll never get
your dauber down.

821
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,625
Yup.

822
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,502
Well, just don't worry about
what anybody else is thinking.

823
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,255
Don't worry about
what anybody else is saying.

824
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,049
I just cry...

825
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,218
Sometimes you just want
to cry?

826
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,344
Yeah, sometimes
I just want to cry.

827
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,429
Well, that's okay.

828
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,431
Crying's good for you.

829
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,267
SHII ANN:<i> Which one of these</i>
<i>things is not like the other?</i>

830
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,896
<i>Okay? I'm the only minority</i>
<i>on this island.</i>

831
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,232
<i>I'd forgotten how</i>

832
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,360
culturally different
I am from the mass of America.

833
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,780
<i>So I'm sticking out</i>
<i>like a sore thumb.</i>

834
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,896
Hey, guys.

835
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,565
Tonight, task at hand--

836
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,942
vote out another member
from your own tribe.

837
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,236
Before we get to the vote, Robb,

838
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,072
straight scoop-- what's you
guys' impression of Chuay Gahn?

839
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,199
They seem like a happy bunch
of people,

840
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,827
like they're all getting along
pretty well, and, uh,

841
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,412
good for them, man.

842
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,164
You guys think you're stronger
than Chuay Gahn?

843
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,457
For sure. Without a doubt.
Come on, bro.

844
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,335
Come on, bro?
Who's sitting at Tribal Council?

845
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,961
ROBB:
Hey. This is one...

846
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,338
I-I think
we're still up on them.

847
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,673
I'm just saying,
you're not kicking their ass.

848
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,676
Mm. We'll see what the future
holds for Chuay Gahn.

849
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,345
All I know is, tonight
somebody's going home,

850
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,763
because you guys lost
today, so...

851
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,513
-It's all right.
-That is a fact.

852
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,600
That is a fact, Jack.

853
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,230
Stephanie, you were sick
first couple of days, right?

854
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,522
Are you contributing
as much as anybody else?

855
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,816
STEPHANIE:
I was sick, and-and...

856
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,985
but I overcame it,
and I think that, you know,

857
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,321
yeah, I'm still contributing
just as much as everyone else,

858
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,656
and I'm really proud of them,

859
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,075
'cause they-they were kind of
struggling at first, I thought,

860
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,577
as far as the survivor mode.
Um... because in the beginning,

861
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,705
they were a little more focused
on the shelter,

862
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,457
you know, and I didn't think
that that was priority, in-in

863
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,835
the situation that we were in,
where food and water was...

864
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,421
was, uh, what we needed
to... to survive.

865
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,090
And, uh,
they've come a long way.

866
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,007
They're doing
a whole lot better.

867
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,176
Ken, when you hear
that kind of a comment,

868
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,511
is that, "That's Stephanie,
we-we know that,"

869
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,720
or does that surprise you that

870
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,182
she was sort of sitting back
there and feeling that way?

871
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:49,850
KEN: No, it didn't surprise me
at all.

872
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,810
I mean, it was... it was obvious

873
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,312
that she had no interest
in the shelter, and

874
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,357
from square one, their main
priority was food and...

875
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:56,816
and water.

876
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,651
PROBST:
Okay.

877
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,569
Obviously, nobody took
the offer up

878
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,197
on the switch, but

879
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,532
strategically,
will anybody admit

880
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,201
that you went through
the process of thinking,

881
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,411
"All right, this is a game.

882
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,871
Do I gain anything
from doing this?"

883
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,873
Shii Ann, did it go
through your head at all?

884
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,710
I thought about it for, like,
two seconds, but really, no,

885
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,378
because I really like
this tribe, and

886
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,338
I feel very comfortable here,
and I don't...

887
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,382
I don't think
I want to switch at this time.

888
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,384
Time to vote.

889
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,593
Penny, you're first.

890
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,901
Tonight I'm voting
for Stephanie,

891
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,446
um, based on what happened
the first week of camp.

892
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,614
There were a few words
that were exchanged

893
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,532
that were not very nice,

894
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,493
and some things
that were done at camp

895
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,536
that a few of us
didn't appreciate.

896
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,929
Shii, I do think
you're a sweet girl,

897
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,682
but you really get
on my nerves, so,

898
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,893
have to vote for you.

899
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,577
Tonight my vote's for Steph.

900
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,830
Steph, you're a beautiful,
beautiful person,

901
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,832
and I just wish
you hadn't alienated yourself

902
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,459
so much from the start.

903
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,002
And then we could have seen

904
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,046
just how beautiful a person
you really were.

905
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,309
Sorry, girl.

906
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,686
You get on my nerves, and
I don't like being around you.

907
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,855
Nothing personal.

908
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,907
I'll go tally the votes.

909
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,506
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

910
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,674
The person voted out
will be asked

911
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,343
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

912
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:29,802
I'll read the votes.

913
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,349
First vote...

914
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,935
Steph.

915
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,773
Steph. That's two votes-- Steph.

916
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,530
Shii Ann.

917
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,830
Shii Ann. It's two votes--
Shii Ann, two votes-- Steph.

918
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,712
Stephanie, that's three votes.

919
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:10,843
Fourth vote-- Steph.

920
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,928
That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

921
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,690
Stephanie, the tribe has spoken.

922
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,361
Good luck, guys.

923
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,529
See you.

924
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,198
Bye, babe.

925
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,084
PROBST: Well, you guys
have been out here 15 days,

926
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,252
a long time for sure,

927
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,089
but just a little over the third
of the way into this game.

928
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,466
Think about it.
Sleep on it.

929
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,926
Take your torches,
head back to camp.

930
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,177
Good night, guys.

931
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,691

939
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,753
You got some set of balls
to approach me with this.

940
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,797
Don't ... try to tell me that
I'm doing something I'm not,

941
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,383
all right?
'Cause I'm not ... stupid.

942
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,139
I just want to say that, um,

943
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,849
