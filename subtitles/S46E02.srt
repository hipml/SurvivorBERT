Kenz, I need

And I'm not confident, man.

KENZIE:
I love Bhanu. I have

65
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,479
a sweet spot
in my soul for him.

66
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,182

he's not a good liar.

67
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,684
He almost, like, blew it.

68
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,319
Aah!

69
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,721
KENZIE: He shoots from the hip
and he's very passionate.

70
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,592
So, I can see it being
a liability down the line

71
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,894
that he can't keep

72
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,830
what needs to be kept secret
secret.

73
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,366

you know, Kenzie is cool

-TIFFANY: Kenzie has a very

85
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,637
vibrant personality.

86
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,607
She's good at making friends,
she's good at, like,

87
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,175
you know,
just drawing people in.

88

So,

89
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,612
it makes me a little nervous.

90
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,715
She knows her best bet
is to lock in with me and you.

91
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:13,086
I just need to figure out, like,
how locked in with me she is.

92
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,321
I don't know why
I get a weird vibe

93

00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,001
Good smell. (blowing)

-TIFFANY: I smell it.
KENZIE: Fire?

96
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,171
You smell that smoke?

97
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,173
It's getting hot...

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,275

people have,

107
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,094

we are losers.

00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,632
Oh, my God.

109
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,602
Ooh! It's hard when you have,
like, nothing in your body.

110
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,871

people are starting

111

112
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,509
and people are starting
to, like,

113
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,744
lose their spirit a little bit.

114
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,615
It's just tough. It's just hard.

115
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,452
I mean, there's just a lot
going on. Like,

116
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,256
I haven't slept,
I haven't really eaten.

117
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,393
It's just so overwhelming

118
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,563
because it seems like everything
is just gonna be easy

119
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,632
and perfect
and you're just gonna, like,

120
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,167
get it done.

121
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,968
And then you get here
and you're faced

122
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,603
with the reality that, like,

123
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,906
being so tired and depleted.

124
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,340

and this is hard.

126
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,747
I know I have
what it takes to win, but

127
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,383
I think I needed
to take a second

128

back in the game.

129
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,388

Right now, I'm closest

159

164
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,977
I do think that she is...

165
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,312
she is as-as big
as a threat as people think.

166
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,014
I was, like, day one

167
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,451
with Venus. Like,
we connected on a heart level.

168
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:42,188
But very quickly, I learned
people don't trust her.

169
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,091
And if she's being perceived
a certain way, and

170
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,094
it's lighting off alarms
in more than one person,

171
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,998
I have to distance myself
from her, even if it's hard.

172
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,366
If no one trusts her
as a number,

173
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,800
she's not a number
to me, either.

174
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,338
-Today, probably not, but...
-Not at all today?

175
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,340
I mean, maybe later, later,

176

-and, like, sit and stuff.
-Yeah.

178
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,579
When it comes to Soda,

179
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,447
I had an immediate connection
with her.

180
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:12,051
But right now,
she has her game face on, and

181
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,252
I know what's going on.

182
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,454
Soda's not dumb, you know?

183
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,089
Soda's with the numbers.

184
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,759
Tevin-- right now, he's king.
He's at the top.

185
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,394
Tevin has a deep,
personal connection

186
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,962
with literally everyone but me.

187
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,430
So,

188
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,333
if the most social butterfly
is not trying to, like,

189
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,102
talk to me in any way,
then I'm screwed.

190
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,305
This is amazing.
Thank you. Um...

191
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,240
Next thing I want to do is
go get some vines 'cause

192
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,741
I want
to put our clothing line up,

193
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,843
and then I want
to build the thing for this

194
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,312
and work on the fireplace,
as well.

195
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,547
HUNTER:
Okay. What we need
to do is just...

196
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,582
VENUS:
Right now, I'm stressed
because it feels like

197
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,785
I'm not even being heard.

198
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,620
It's, like, everyone has, like,

199
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,889
some kind of connection with
one another, but I feel like

200
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:54,360
I don't really have a deep
emotional bond with anyone,

201
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,230
and it feels like...
I'm not even, like, worth...

202
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,533
like, I'm not even worth
talking to.

203
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,602
I feel like people might look
at me, and they assume

204
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,405
things have been handed to me,
or that I haven't worked hard

205
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,074
or struggled in any way.

206
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,510
But the truth is that my parents
immigrated from Iran to Canada.

207
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,212
They realized that

208
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,247
as the government was becoming
more and more oppressive,

209
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,017
that this was no place
to raise a young woman.

210
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,653
And from childhood,
I've tried to show

211
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,457
just how capable
and strong Persian women are.

212
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,560
So, my whole life, it's, like,
I don't want to be seen as weak.

213
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,829
Like, I need
to be this, like, tough badass.

214
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,264
Like, I can't let people
see me struggle.

215
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,333
And so, in this game,

216
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,935
I'm going in
with that same mentality,

217
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,670
and it's kind of biting me
in the ass because

218
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,505
people want
to see that vulnerability.

219
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,273
They want to be able
to connect with you emotionally,

220
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,843
and I'm struggling
to do that right now.

221
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,612
It hurts on a social
and, like, personal level

222
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,614
to see that no one's even trying
to make an effort

223
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,050
to acknowledge your existence.

224
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,019
And I don't know what to do.

225
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,453
Makes you feel like

226
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,988
there's something wrong
with you.

227
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,025
And, like,
I can't be anyone but myself.

228
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,432
BEN: All right, guys.

229
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,935
Can't start a fire
without a spark.

230
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,407
Being the first to light fire
is totally on the bucket list.

231
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,475
-MORIAH: You're gonna do it.
-MARIA: There we go.

232
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,544
There we go. We got it. We got
it. We got it. We got it.

233
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,746
(cheering)

234
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,150
We lit fire, baby!

235
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,185
Oh, yeah!

236
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,854
BEN:
So I'm just sitting there
with the flint,

237
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,958
going hard at it,
and I got it, and I lit fire.

238
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,828
And I felt higher
than rocking a sick show.

239
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,164
You did it, Ben. My man!

240
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,933
BEN:
I'm crying thinking
about fire. Like,

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,402
I didn't even cry
over meeting Nicolas Cage.

242
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,138
-High five, buddy. You did it.
-Bring it in, dude.
-Dude.

243
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,141
BEN:
I was always the kid
with so much energy.

244
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,876
Teachers couldn't handle me.

245
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,311
You know,
I haven't been the sharpest tool

246
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,713
in the shred my whole life,
you know?

247
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,249
I had a stutter
and I had a lisp.

248
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,717
So, like, I was bullied.

249
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,454
But I remember my dad
had a guitar in his closet.

250
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,923
I found it. The power of rock--

251
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,259
the thing that helped me
overcome my insecurities.

252
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,695
I've played shows
all over the world.

253
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,864
I played big festivals,

254
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,533
and I did so many things

255
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,769
that, like,
I think I blew my own mind.

256
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,839
-Good job, Ben.
-Thanks, dudes.

257
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,241
-Dude, you crushed.
-You kept at it.

258
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,276
BEN:
But in my head,
I feel like I am, like,

259
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,079
still a little, insecure kid.

260
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,950
Who I am has always been in me,
but I haven't trusted it.

261
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,285
I don't know why I'm crying.
I'm just, like, so hyped.

262
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,755
(laughing)

263
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,925
BEN:
For me, it was so important
to get fire because

264
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,928
it was so out of my element
and comfort zone.

265
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,331
Makes you feel like
you could do anything.

266
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,700
-MARIA: Ben, you know
who's proud of you?
-Who?

267
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,034
MARIA:
Everybody.

268
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,369
(all cheering)

269
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,670
TIM: As a tribe,

270
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,573
we're communicating
in a healthy way.

271
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,941
I think
it wouldn't hurt to throw in

272
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,910
just a few pieces of husk.

273
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,645
TIM:
Even individually,
I'm in a good place.

274
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,580
I got Charlie and Ben.

275
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,781
MORIAH:
Here. I'm gonna...

276
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:03,916
MARIA:
Go over there to get the water?

277
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,185
TIM:
We know that Maria has

278
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,286
a benefit right now.

279
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:13,726
TIM:
Maria went on a journey
and she has an extra vote and

280
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,960
it's a big deal.

281
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,563
We know that Maria
has the extra vote.

282
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,332
BEN:
I think somebody's gonna
have to approach Maria.

283
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,169
I feel like Tim's got a
good connection going with her.

284
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,638
TIM:
The goal we all should have
in common is Maria.

285
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,939
Yeah.

286
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,241
CHARLIE:
So if we could pull her in, then

287
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,576
-we've got four.
-BEN: Yeah.

288
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,478
And, like, she might have
an extra vote, too, so...

289
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,014
The way that it's going is

290
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,783
Tim and Ben...

291
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,485
and then me,

292
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,788
and they want
to work with Maria.

293
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,792
-Just maybe for, like,
a minute, you know...
-Yeah.

294
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,696
CHARLIE:
And then you have
the three women and myself--

295
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,897
"Charlie's Angels."

296
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,232
MORIAH:
I do want to say, like, I think

297
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,667
it's really important
to, like, solidify

298
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,569
-and talk about this now.
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

299
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,571
Everyone's trying
to count to four.

300
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,838
The Angels and Charlie--

301
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,307
that's four.

302
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,242
But that leaves me
on the bottom.

303
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:07,213
If we lose three times,
it's just the Angels.

304
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,115
And so, I feel a little bit,
you know,

305
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,284
dancing without a partner
out here, you know?

306
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,453
It's just me on the dance floor,
and I want to-I want

307
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,455
to waltz with someone.
I want to tango with someone.

308
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,090
You know, that's what I want
to do out here.

309
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,025
I want to have a ride-or-die.

310
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,294
And it seems like

311
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,530
Maria and I have built bonds
with both sides.

312
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,131
So,

313
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,666
if there's someone out here
that I feel like

314
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,336
would be a good alliance partner
for me, it would be Maria.

315
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,372
CHARLIE: So it's, like...

316
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,275
The ladies and me,
which I friggin' love.

317
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,843
-Yeah, I love that, too.
-I love it.

318
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,980
But the thing is is, like,
we need strength, obviously.

319
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,350
-Like, we need some strong...
-People?

320
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,987
Maria and I might be
the two best buds, you know,

321
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,657
that pair that can decide
the direction of the tribe.

322
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,660
In any alliance,
there has to be sub-alliances.

323
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,195
-Right?
-Yeah, and, uh...

324
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,163
Which is dirty to think about,
but, like, there has to be.

325
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,165
But it's-it's...
it's just a fact of the game.

326
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,067
And, like, my favorite players
are Malcolm and Denise.

327
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,370
-Yeah. Malcolm and Denise.
-Like, I'm a...

328
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,005
-I'm like a ride-or-die player.
-You like...

329
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,906
Denise is one of my favorites.

330
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,242
And it's gonna be us two. Cool?

331
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,344
I...

332
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,681
We're gonna do this.

333
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,017
I feel like I could emulate her

334
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,654
because she's kind of, like,
that strong... that strong mom.

335
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,824
Yeah. You're a stronger mom.
I can tell.

336
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,660
MARIA:
I like the idea
of working with Charlie.

337
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:31,096
You know, this reminds me a lot
like Malcolm and Denise.

338
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,798
-And if we just
keep our options open,
-Yeah.

339
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,800
-like, we don't have
to make any decisions right now.
-Yeah.

340
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,770
At this point,
we could go either way

341
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:42,274
with Moriah and Jem
or with Ben and Tim.

342
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,942
So it kind of was
exciting for me

343
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,011
to think that, well,
maybe the two of us could be

344
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,280
the decision-makers
working together.

345
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,750
Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,521
Right. Yup.

347
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,837
VENUS:
I'm not blind.

348
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,972
I see that I'm on the bottom,

349
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,275
and it all comes back to Tevin.

350
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,943
It doesn't matter
how hard I try.

351
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,212
He has too many links
with too many people,

352
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,414
and there's nothing
I can possibly do

353
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,916
to compete with those.

354
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,952
So I want to double down
on finding that idol

355
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,090
in order to actually ensure some
kind of backup safety for myself

356
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,892
and turn the tides to throw
the votes on someone else.

357
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,629
So, I need to find this idol
and I need to find it quick.

358
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,737
My feeling is that

359
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,272
I'm up on the chopping block
or Venus.

360
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,377
So if I can get an idol, that
will save me, that would be big.

361
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,779
HUNTER: I guess it's something
about being Southern

362
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,848
or something about just wanting
to collect firewood,

363
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:59,118
but I've played it really well
because they all think I'm just,

364
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,619
you know,
the happy-go-lucky country guy

365
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,488
who's just having a good time
out here camping.

366
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,224
But the reality is
I'm here to play hard.

367
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,658
I'm the only one going out

368
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,460
and getting a substantial amount
of firewood,

369
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,028
so why not just look around?

370
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,132
I know the trails, I know
interesting-looking trees,

371
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,635
and so, I'm pretty confident
that I'm gonna find this thing.

372
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,410
Ooh.

373
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,178
Ooh! Snap.

374
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,248
What is this? Oh.
A Beware Advantage?

375
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,450
So I see a parchment paper

376
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,719
sticking out of a tree, and

377
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,854
I pull it out
and it says "Beware."

378
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,362
I didn't come to Survivor to...

379
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,197
not take risks,

380
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,466
so we're gonna open it
and see what it says.

381
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,475
Well, Beware Advantage is here.
Dig down.

382
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,043
Oh, my God.

383
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,112
So, I open up
the Beware Advantage

384
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,616
and it tells me to dig right
beneath where this note is.

385
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,585
And I'm digging, digging,
digging, digging.

386
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,586
And I hit a box.

387
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,321
Oh, my God. What is this?

388
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,989
I'm super excited
and I go to open it up

389
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,324
and there's a lock on it.

390
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,126
I was like,
"Oh, why is there a lock?"

391
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,596
Then I realized that the box
has, like, a little tube,

392
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,897
and then there's a note
in there.

393
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,833
Oh, my God. It's complicated.

394
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,156
That's why it's...

395
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,724
This Beware Advantage is
very different from anything

396
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,526
I've seen
because the stipulation

397
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,695
on the Beware Advantage is
you have to lose

398
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,296
to retrieve
further instructions.

399
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,631
So,

400
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,733
if we continue to win,
I'm still safe.

401
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,404
If we do lose, then I am gonna
go into scramble mode because

402
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,206
if I don't find it before
Tribal Council, I'm useless.

403
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,674
I don't have no vote.

404
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,309
It's nerve-racking
because you see this Ferrari

405
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,613
in your driveway, but you have
no gas, you have no key.

406
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,947
I basically have

407
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,949
a useless car
that you can't drive.

408
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,553
An idol is, like, everything to
me, but I have to work for it.

409
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,488
Survivor, man.

410
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,624
You ain't make it easy
for a brother.

411
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,397
♪ ♪

412
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,275
Q: Right.

413
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,776
-TIFFANY: So why you doing it?
-Q: For the protein.

414
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,211
TIFFANY:
Girl, the amount of protein

415
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,413
you getting
from them little ants...

416
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:46,985
JESS: Yeah.

417
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,554
TIFFANY:
Jess is a little weird,

418
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,689
a little quirky and out there,

419
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,925
but she's such a nice person.

420
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,962
I think she's just
a little socially awkward.

421
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,934
-(laughs)
-JESS: In my tribe,

422
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,637
I'm going up against some
very strong personalities, and

423
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,840
I thought that I would be
this kind of social butterfly.

424
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,142
But I don't know--

425
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,443
maybe I've been
a little bit more reserved

426
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,711
than my normal self.

427
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,212
That's why I eat the ants--

428
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,948
so I don't have to talk.

429
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,449
BHANU:
So,

430
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,850
-you're recently married?
-JESS: Yeah.

431
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,186
We'd been together
for seven years or something

432
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,821
when we got married.

433
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,089
BHANU:
Did you meet him in Canada?

434
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,992
No, I met him outside a bar
in Hong Kong.

435
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,594
He's from St. Louis.

436
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,762
BHANU:
This is... this crazy,
your story.

437
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,431
TIFFANY:
That's what I said.

438
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,766
BHANU:
Um, I can't put all
these puzzle pieces together.

439
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,768
I'm a puzzle.
No, I'm not.

440
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,470
I feel like
people don't really know

441
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,440
what I'm like inside,
but I've come to realize

442
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,342
that it doesn't really matter
what they think.

443
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,811
I have a family that loves me,
a husband that loves me,

444
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,879
and that's what's important.

445
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,748
But right now, my strategy
is not to be the person

446
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,184
on the outs, so,

447
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,020
I'm making more of an effort
to get them to know me.

448
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,521
-How do you say "hello"?
-JESS: Something...

449
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,956
-Ni hao.
-Q: Ni hao.
-TIFFANY: Ni hao.

450
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,293
-BHANU: How about "thank you"?
-Xiexie.

451
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,562
-What is, "xiexie ni"?
-"Ni" is "you."

452
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,997
-So it's like, "Xiexie..."
-Yeah.

453
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,965
-How do you know that?
-Rush Hour, baby.

454
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,600
-JESS: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

455
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,537
Q: It's a movie
with Jackie Chan in it.

456
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,340
KENZIE: The situation
as it stands right now is

457
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,175
that Q, Tiff and I--

458
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,544
we have the numbers right now.
We have three.

459
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,615
-Do you want me
to come with you?
-BHANU: Yeah.

460
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,317
Let's go.

461
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,652
KENZIE:
But here's the thing.

462
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,321
Q and Tiff both
are strong players.

463
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,556
-JESS: You went inside the cave?
-KENZIE: Yeah.

464
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,091
I'll show you the way.

465
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,662
And part of my job as a stylist
is building connections.

466
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,598
So, the best thing for my game
is being friends with everyone

467
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,368
and keeping my options open
because, eventually,

468
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,903
big moves have to be made.

469
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,972
-BHANU: Wow.
KENZIE: Like,
isn't this amazing?

470
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,774
BHANU:
This is-this is gorgeous.

471
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,076
How I wish this was,
uh, the last day.

472
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,546
KENZIE: Yeah.

473
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,782
-I mean,
we can pull off anything.
-JESS: Yeah.

474
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,452
KENZIE:
I mean, we have to kind of
see how the challenge goes.

475
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,721
-JESS: Yeah.
-Like, I want to win.

476
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:06,692
But I also want to, like,
not discount any options.

477
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,367
And then just, like,
scrap our way through?

478
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,536
It's either them or us,
you know?

479
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,538
I kind of tossed some bait

480
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,907
out there to see if I could
work with Jess and Bhanu

481
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,444
on a possible blindside, and

482
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,679
I didn't really get much.

483
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,716
What do you think?

484
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,686
-I need to think more
about what I think.
-Okay.

485
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:39,257
I don't think Jess or Bhanu
are very strategic players

486
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,626
and I don't want
to have to hold people's

487
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,228
hands through this game.

488
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,965
You can't go to Tiff and Q and
talk about this conversation.

489
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,467
-JESS: Yeah. Yeah.
-KENZIE: They will freak out.

490
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,069
-I'm not gonna say that.
-Okay, good.

491
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,071
JESS:
That was actually
the first time that I talked

492
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,406
strategy with Kenzie
in a meaningful way.

493
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,241
And she's playing
really, really hard.

494
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,776
KENZIE:
Every... We're all
stirring the pot.

495
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,177
We're all stirring
the same pot.

496
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,213
We're all stirring the same pot.

497
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,684
JESS:
I honestly can't tell
if she's for real

498
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,719
because she can look at you
and make you feel

499
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,621
like you're her best friend, so,

500
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,924
Kenzie is playing a great social
game, and that's dangerous.

501
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,459
So at this point,

502
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,028
my plan is to blindside Kenzie.

503
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,309
Q:
Jess threw Kenzie
under the bus by saying,

504
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,545
"Kenzie threw out 'we should
get rid of strength.'"

505
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,180
If Kenzie's supposed to be

506
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,482
in my alliance of three,

507
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,817
she shouldn't have said that.

508
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,287
It'll all work out. Trust me.

509
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,889
Right now,
I think Jess is trying

510
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,557
to come up with a solution

511
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,958
to get the target off her back.

512
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,660
She felt some heat
last night at Tribal.

513
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,797
-If we vote together,
we both will be here.
-Yeah.

514
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,499
Q:
But now I'm thinking,
can I trust Kenzie?

515
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,514
JEM:
Ooh, it's piping hot.

516
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,754
We got the...
the saltwater papaya coming.

517
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,889
Oh, hell, yeah.

518
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,092
Oh, wow. Really?

519
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,461
Tim's the papaya papa.

520
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,931
I'll take that nickname--
Papaya Papa.

521
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,800
All right, so, Charlie's Tarzan,

522
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,468
Maria's Lieutenant Mom,
Mo's Mochete.

523
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,437
-(laughing)
-Ooh.

524
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,840
-I'm Benevolence.
-Water.

525
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,543
-Jungle Jem!
-MARIA: Ah!

526
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,847
Jungle Jem! We got 'em!

527
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,889
(laughing):
Yeah.

528
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:54,593
I knew coming out into this game
that strategy-wise,

529
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,697
I'll be good,
but a weakness of mine is

530
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,465
the social game.

531
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,133
-MARIA: That's a lot.
-JEM: I don't need
his validation.

532
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,070
Okay, we're good.
Let's pop this in.

533
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,272
But I think
it's just so important

534
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,508
to connect with people
out here, and

535
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,977
I'm going to have to
figure out a way.

536
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,411
So,

537
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,046
I'm a massive Taylor Swift fan,

538
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:18,016
and I love Star Wars
and Harry Potter

539
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,918
and all these nerdy things.

540
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,954
So, anytime I can sort of
be spouting all...

541
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,457
any sort of stuff like that
and... and just showing people

542
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,627
what I like and who I am,
that's what I want to do.

543
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,667
Whoever runs out

544
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:39,204
-of songs first loses.
-MORIAH: From one artist.

545
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,072
CHARLIE:
What you got, Ben?

546
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:44,809
I'd go with, uh...

547
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,012
-I'd go with Metallica.
-CHARLIE: Metallica?

548
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,681
Greatest metal band of all time.

549
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,416
Yeah.

550
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,817
CHARLIE:
I've been getting

551
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,053
to know Ben really well.
He's, like,

552
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,222
a music savant.
So I was like,

553
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,157
"I'm gonna put
my Taylor Swift knowledge

554
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,594
head-to-head against
Ben's Metallica knowledge."

555
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:07,065
-Metallica versus T. Swift,
Charlie versus Ben?
-Yeah.

556
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,935
-You ready?
-Okay, go.

557
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,803
"All of the Girls
You Loved Before."

558
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,905
-"My Apocalypse."
-"The Best Day."

559
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,273
-BEN: "Seek & Destroy."
-CHARLIE: "You Belong with Me."

560
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,275
-"Jump in the Fire.
-"Should've Said No."

561
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,810
"Motorbreath."

562
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,946
"Mr. Perfectly Fine"
about Joe Jonas.

563
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,681
-Ooh.
-They're cool now, though.

564
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,417
-(laughing)
-BEN: What a stupid way
to pass time.

565
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,152
And if I had done that
in any other setting,

566
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,586
everybody around me

567
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,455
would be like, "Ben, shut up."

568
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:34,259
But here, everybody was like,
"Yo, they're going for it."

569
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,660
-"Dyers Eve."
-"Gorgeous."

570
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,829
-"Enter Sandman."
-(laughing)

571
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,865
-"Delicate."
-"Sad But True."

572
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,968
"This is Why
We Can't Have Nice Things."

573
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,536
-"Holier Than Thou."
-(laughing)

574
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,371
-"I Did Something Bad."
-"The Unforgiven."

575
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,506
MORIAH: I'm living
in a universe right now

576
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,476
where I am wildly entertained

577
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:55,313
by just two guys just
saying names back and forth.

578
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,615
-"The Struggle Within."
-"Clean."

579
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,352
-"Ain't My Bitch."
-(laughing)

580
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,387
-Facts: It's a Metallica song.
-CHARLIE: I ain't your bitch.

581
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,955
It's a grueling battle,

582
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,690
back and forth,
one after another.

583
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,025
BEN:
All right, onto the next album.

584
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,860
"Some Kind of Monster."

585
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,095
"We are Never Ever
Getting Back Together."

586
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,363
Like, ever.

587
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,865
-"The House That Jack Built."
-"All Too Well."

588
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,301
-"Until It Sleeps."
-"All Too Well,"
ten-minute version.

589
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,769
Ooh.

590
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,839
Okay, well, we have that
on this album. Don't worry.

591
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,140
(laughing)

592
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,142
TIM:
It's, like, name after name.

593
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,744
And, like, yo,
y'all at least named, like,

594
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,213
75 songs each, yo.

595
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,848
So we're getting into the albums
I'm not very into,

596
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,750
-but I still got 'em in my mind.
-CHARLIE: Ooh, yeah, let's go.

597
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,917
-Come on!
-BEN: I've still got 'em.

598
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,985
JEM: I've never listened

599
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,354
to a single song of Metallica's.

600
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,390
Wait. There's the Metallica
album with Lou Reed,

601
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,924
which is really terrible.

602
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,596
JEM:
At some point, I'm like,

603
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,131
"Are we done? Like, is this it?"

604
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,070
BEN:
I'm just thinking on this album.
I got more.

605
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,673
Okay, here we go.
"Creeping Death."

606
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,375
A song about Passover.

607
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,277
Uh, "Coney Island."

608
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,712
"2 X 4"

609
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,047
"You're Not Sorry."

610
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,381
Damn. All right.

611
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,883
How many more you got?

612
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,584
A lot.

613
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,020
BEN:
Man, if I only knew the
really bad albums a little more.

614
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,422
(laughing)

615
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,924
I don't believe
in any bad Taylor Swift albums.

616
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,127
BEN:
Listen, there's a bit of
an unfair advantage, because

617
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,063
although I love Metallica,

618
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,698
I'm not a stan
for terrible albums.

619
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,167
Dude, I think I got to tap out.

620
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,935
It's not right.

621
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,171
Well, Ben,
this has been the great war.

622
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,505
-TIM: Great job.
-Which is... which is...

623
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,340
We can... We'll go round two
with another band.

624
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,810
-Which is another
Taylor Swift song.
-Oh. Dead.

625
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,845
CHARLIE: I was pretty impressed
with both of us

626
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,081
just being able
to recall so many songs,

627
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,515
and it was just fun.

628
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,784
It was pure, pure fun.

629
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,653
And doing things like that,

630
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,388
I think it just
endears you to people.

631
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,590
We easily named a hundred songs.

632
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,492
Yeah, we... we went hard.

633
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,760
Yeah.

634
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,995
Charlie is an adorable goofball,

635
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,564
and I love him for it.

636
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,365
I am having the most fun

637
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,634
out here, you know.
It's, like,

638
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,404
I would say, even
if I ever did Survivor again,

639
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,406
I don't think the experience
would be this dope,

640
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,740
'cause it's these people

641
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,642
that are making it
so enjoyable for me.

642
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,015
♪ ♪

643
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,784
So, I don't know if you said,
Liz, but did you ever say

644
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,453
that you would, like, remarry?

645
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,655
Maybe. I cannot imagine

646
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:20,992
the person that would marry Liz.

647
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,694
-Oh.
-I don't mean this

648
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,630
any type of way,
but there is a special type

649
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:29,667
of... man
who can deal with someone

650
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,904
making so much money
and not actually needing them.

651
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,839
Wow.

652
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:38,209
LIZ: I own my own company.
I'm an online entrepreneur, and

653
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,080
I've pushed myself so hard
because I came from nothing.

654
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,214
And honestly,

655
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,983
I came into this game

656
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,117
wanting the title.

657
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,318
I don't need the money.

658
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,254
The money would better my life,

659
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,922
but it wouldn't change my life.

660
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:56,094
And so, winning this game is
going to show my daughter and

661
00:29:56,161 --> 00:30:00,131
my family that, "Wow, Liz
really can do anything. Maybe

662
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,101
I can do something similar
one day."

663
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,536
That's the most important thing.

664
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,638
TEVIN: I think that
there's plenty of men out there

665
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,473
who would want to be with Liz.

666
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,575
-That's for your...
your first comment.
-SODA: Agreed.

667
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,710
TEVIN:
So, whether you're looking
at a range of men now...

668
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:13,912
-Well, they want to,
but can they?
-TEVIN: Ooh.

669
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,814
Everybody wants to be with Liz.
Trust me.

670
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,816
TEVIN:
Oh. You trust lady luck.

671
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,185
RANDEN:
I just don't understand

672
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,187
what kind of game
Liz is playing.

673
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,156
Nobody knows who Liz is.
Liz wears rainbows.

674
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,858
She's a CEO of five companies.

675
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,459
She teaches everybody
how to make a million dollars.

676
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,228
So, it's-it's crazy.

677
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,096
Have you had any conversations
with her? Like, real ones?

678
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,831
Yeah, a little bit. Well,
the problem with Liz is that

679
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,501
she's like a... It's like
talking to a billboard.

680
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,336
You know what I mean?
It's kind of like, you know,

681
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,837
-she's telling you...
-She's got a phrase
for everything?

682
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,606
Yeah. "I'm like a CEO,
I'm a company." And she's like,

683
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,107
"Well, I'm too good to do this."
And whatever.

684
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,176
At this point,
I have to make a decision.

685
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,878
I have this amazing
Beware Advantage.

686
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,680
I'm very excited

687
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,181
because if I complete
the Beware Advantage,

688
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,250
I have an idol in my pocket.

689
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,886
The problem is, for me

690
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,588
to stay in the game longer
and make big moves,

691
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:00,325
I just feel as if, like,
I need one person to trust

692
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,060
on this island,

693
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,462
and that's the biggest issue
I have in my tribe.

694
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,331
I don't really trust anybody.

695
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,832
-Good talking.
-RANDEN: Soda and Hunter

696
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,968
are close to Tevin.

697
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,469
-I just chugged this. Like...
-You need them electrolytes.

698
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,804
It was full.

699
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,372
RANDEN:
And then Liz--

700
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,640
there's too many
inconsistencies.

701
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,975
Like, I do a lot
of podcast interviews.

702
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,376
I've done, like, 300 in the last

703
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,711
-Yeah?
-two years or something.

704
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,045
RANDEN:
I don't know.

705
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,380
Something's not up
with that story.

706
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,648
But that's just me.

707
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,983
It could be Survivor
kind of paranoia.

708
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,451
Venus, I think, in my opinion,

709
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,186
she's the ultimate liar
in this game.

710
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,121
-If I go off,
and you see me, like,
-Yeah.

711
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,589
-by the water, I'm just, like...
-Chilling.

712
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,924
-I'm just chilling. Like,
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

713
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,792
I'm not, like, looking around.

714
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,728
RANDEN:
So, I don't have many options.

715
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,597
But at the end of the day,
I made a decision

716
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,532
and I said, "I'm going to trust
the one person

717
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,234
"I originally thought
not to trust,

718
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,570
and if it fails,
then that's on me."

719
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,019
-Okay.
-RANDEN: weirdly enough,

720
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,620
the person I shouldn't
be comfortable with--

721
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,055
I'm actually comfortable
with Venus.

722
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,890
I shouldn't be, though.
She's young,

723
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:09,427
she's ambitious, and I just feel
like she will cut my throat.

724
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,397
But I came to Survivor
to gamble and risk.

725
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:15,033
So... I did it. I told her.

726
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,475
VENUS:
So, Randen tells me
that he finds himself

727
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,278
a Beware Advantage.

728
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,315
And the moment I heard it,
I became, like, a statue.

729
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,949
I couldn't process
what he was saying

730
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,384
'cause I was equal parts
excited,

731
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,454
equal parts pissed
that it didn't happen to me.

732
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,256
My whole thing is, like,
I want to use your gifts

733
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,792
and my gifts
to get further in the game.

734
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,126
You know what I mean?

735
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,797
Like, "I'm like, damn,
like, there really is...

736
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,198
I can't catch a damn break."

737
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,167
And you're my break.
God bless you.

738
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:53,204
I really thought that
my life in this game is over.

739
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,573
And within the span
of just one day,

740
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,908
everything has changed.

741
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,276
All of a sudden, I have

742
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,913
an advantage I could
potentially use to my favor,

743
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:04,115
a rock solid-alliance.

744
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,852
So, it does a lot to...
breathe some life in my game.

745
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,454

So, Q, obviously,

771
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,479
it's not fun for Yanu to go
to Tribal and vote somebody out,

772
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,815
but it is a game
and you're down somebody.

773
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:47,151
And clearly, these two other
tribes are taking a little joy

774
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,620
in talking and joking
about who it was

775

we're the laughingstock,

Right now we're down to five

781
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,399

I'm from India.
And we want freedom.

790
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:28,526
Gandhi was on a hunger strike

Hunger is not

moving obstacles along the way.

829
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:01,218
When you get to the end, you'll

and a bit of a vocabulary.

978
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,693

Those blocks are very heavy.

997
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:04,408

00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,350
When you have it
and it'll stand,

1016
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,985
get to your mat for the win.

1017
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,888
Yanu now is in on this.

1018
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,157

This is a wide-open challenge
right now.

1024
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,369
Any tribe could win.

1025
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,304
Aah! Aah!

1026
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,073

PROBST: Siga one letter away,

1028
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:14,678
but getting that letter in

1029
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,213
is a whole different thing.

1030
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,021
BEN:
Jeff, come on!

1031
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,057
SODA:

1036
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,768
Let go, let go, let go...

We got to switch these two.

1044
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,284
We have to switch these two?

1045
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,553
-Come on. Come on.
-There's got to be an N.

1046
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,455
Got to push. (grunts)

1047
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,457

00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:07,931
-All right, guys, almost there.
-Aah!

1053
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,867
-Oh!
-PROBST: Yanu, another disaster.

1054
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,635
Blocks everywhere.

1055
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,237
-CHARLIE: All right, Ben.
-(groaning)

1056
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,973

half their puzzle.
-CHARLIE: It's okay.

1057
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,241
(overlapping shouting)

1058
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,776
Nami loses everything.

1059
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,912
(Tiffany screams)

1060
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,480

-(Tiffany screams)
-PROBST: Yanu, another disaster.

1062

00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,196
-Siga loses half their puzzle.
-(distorted screaming)

1064
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,100
Nami loses everything.

1065
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,669
We are wide-open again.

1066
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,607
All three tribes
are still in it.

1067
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,911
You've got to spell
a word correctly on both sides

1068
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,680
and get it to hold on its own.

1069
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,383
The-the... Wait.

1070
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,151
Okay, that letter
over there and this.

1071
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,786
Someone needs
to grab that letter.

1072
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,621
Can we hold on for a sec?
I got to readjust it real quick.

1073
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,590
Wait. Just hold it,
hold it, hold it.

1074
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,425
Oh, my God!

1075

PROBST:
Yanu loses everything again.

1076
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,595

KENZIE: Still not in.

1078
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,831

1081
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,836
-Yes. Oh! No!
-Okay...

1082
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,940
And once again,
Siga loses half their puzzle.

1083
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,608
Tiff, you need to move over.

1084
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,978

That's wrong.
-This is wrong.

1085
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,046
-Okay.

1086
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,414
-I'm gonna grab this, okay?
-Okay.

1087
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,548

Give me that. Come on.
Girl, you got to move faster.

1091
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:43,193
This is a difficult challenge

1092
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,596
that requires communication.

1093
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,134
RANDEN: Come.

1094
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,471

00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,367
-Where's that headband, baby?
-(chuckles)

1182
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:11,835
PROBST:
That headband is toast.

1183
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,836
LIZ: Damn!

1184
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,704
PROBST:
Siga...

1185
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,339
Congratulations.

1186
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,378
Nami, nobody going home
from your tribe.

1187
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,079
Head out. Enjoy the night off.

1188
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:25,215
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Jeff.

1189
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:26,917
PROBST:
Your massive
Survivor fishing kit

1190
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,219
will be waiting for you
back at camp.

1191
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,088
SODA:
Oh, man. Wow.

1192
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,024
PROBST:
Siga, nobody going home
from your tribe.

1193
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,492
Head out. Enjoy the night off.

1194
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,128
And your fishing kit will be
waiting for you back at camp.

1195
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,163
BEN:
Oh, my God.

1196
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:48,071
PROBST:
Bhanu, I saw some real emotion,
maybe frustration

1197
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,940
from you during that challenge.

1198
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,408
What were you feeling?

1199
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:52,742
(sighs)

1200
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:53,743
(stammers)

1201
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,345
We're doing everything right,

1202
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,048
but where we're losing,
I just don't understand that.

1203
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,883
We have the strength.

1204
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,353
What we're missing is the...

1205
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,889
the planning.
I think that's what it is.

1206
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,057
The planning is missing,

1207
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,125
and we have
to put our minds together

1208
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,127
and I think we're
gonna have a chat today

1209
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,530
and that's what
we're gonna do tonight.

1210
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:15,999
PROBST:
Tiffany, this is what happens.

1211
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,269
When you lose once, "Hey,
that's all right. We got it."

1212
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,337
You lose twice.

1213
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:22,572
But when you just
continue to lose...

1214
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,275
-Look at your body language.
You're frustrated.
-I'm pissed.

1215
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,143
I'm pissed. No,
I'm not frustrated. I'm pissed.

1216
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,913
I have a real attitude
right now, so I'm gonna keep

1217
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,549
my actual thoughts to myself
before I say something

1218
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,584
that's gonna have
people looking at me sideways.

1219
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:38,221
But I do not think we should
have lost that challenge.

1220
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:39,589
At all.

1221
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,527
PROBST:
So, Jess, just
listening to Tiffany,

1222
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,229
though she didn't
say anything directly,

1223
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,698
it's gonna be an interesting
afternoon back at camp.

1224
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,334
She's gonna give me
a spanking back at camp.

1225
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,936
Oh, you think
it's directed at you?

1226
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,905
I think so.
Everyone's been yelling at me.

1227
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,140
All day or during the challenge?

1228
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,075
JESS:
During the challenge.

1229
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:02,178
Are you feeling that pressure

1230
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,547
as you head back to camp now?

1231
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:06,049
I think we're going to
have to talk about it at camp.

1232
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,551
I'm just going to
catch my breath right now.

1233
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:10,186
I am feeling pressure.
I think we all are.

1234
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:13,089
PROBST:
All right, Yanu,
once again, Tribal Council,

1235
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,758
where somebody
will be the second person

1236
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,359
voted out of Survivor 46.

1237
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,795
As a penalty for losing--
sorry for you--

1238
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,996
I'm gonna keep this flint.

1239
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,197
Grab your stuff. Head out.

1240
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,999
See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

1241
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,502
KENZIE: We started strong,
and then the puzzle--

1242
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,103
it literally fell apart,

1243
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,705
like, on top of all of us,

1244
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,308
-because Bhanu has a hard time
-(distorted): Jess!

1245
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,877
when he's faced under pressure.

1246
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,246
But Jess dropped a bunch
of pieces a hundred times

1247
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,981
and couldn't
spell the word "persistence."

1248
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,885
So I feel like Jess is our
common denominator in losing.

1249
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,987
I want Jess to go tonight.

1250
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:51,962
There is simply
nothing like Survivor.

1251
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,030
It will test you
on so many levels

1252
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:55,865
and offers you nowhere to hide.

1253
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,468
If that sounds like fun,
apply to be on Survivor.

1254
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,207
NAMI TRIBE: ♪ Nami, Nami ♪

1255
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,042
♪ Nami, Nami ♪

1256
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,479
-♪ Nami... ♪
-♪ Nami, Nami, Nami... ♪

1257
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,648
-Oh, my God.
-(excited chatter)

1258
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,652
-Oh, my God.
-SODA: Holy crap.

1259
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,120
TEVIN:
This is like Christmas.

1260
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:19,055
-Wow!
-TEVIN: Oh, my God.

1261
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,323
LIZ:
Okay, go!

1262
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,126
-Oh! We got the fish!
-LIZ: Ah! We did it!

1263
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,861
TEVIN:
I feel like Rupert.

1264
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,897
Oh, this is like
a dream come true. (chuckles)

1265
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,300
What y'all want to do? Fishing?

1266
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,035
-But we can all go out together.
-SODA: Okay.

1267
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,605
I'm probably gonna rest,
'cause that huge-ass wagon

1268
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:37,040
went over my toe
during the challenge.

1269
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,808
-Oh...
-SODA: Did it really?
-VENUS: Yeah.

1270
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,644
-Got pretty crushed,
so I'm gonna rest.
-SODA: Wow.

1271
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,112
-LIZ: I think she got crushed.
-Yeah.

1272
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,880
We won this challenge,

1273
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:44,881
but I got really pissed

1274
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,750
afterwards. I actually got

1275
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:49,819
my toe crushed by that huge...

1276
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,255
huge-ass wagon because no one
was listening to me. I said,

1277
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:53,790
"Turn left, turn left,"
and they just kept

1278
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,159
going straight and ran me over.

1279
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:59,462
What's the point of winning
if I'm not even being heard?

1280
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,698
-SODA: Was it the moment where
you were wedged at the front
-Yeah.

1281
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,700
-and I tried to push you back?
-VENUS: It was the moment

1282
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,402
when I was saying, "Left, left,"
but you kept going straight,

1283
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,903
and it went right over my toe.

1284
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,171
TEVIN:
This journey
I'm having with Venus

1285
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,573
is really ridiculous, honestly.

1286
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,908
It's up and down.

1287
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,911
It's up and down, and I'm trying
to navigate it, and it...

1288
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,013
It's tough. It is very tough.

1289
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,481
You guys can have a celebration,

1290
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,684
but I'm exhausted right now,
so I'll talk later.

1291
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:24,154
TEVIN:
She's, like, commenting
on the challenge, and we won.

1292
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,023
She brings the tribe morale
down, and, uh, I'm getting

1293
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,525
real tired
and real sick of this.

1294
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,028
I had a little bit of an issue

1295
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,897
with how we worked together
as a team today,

1296
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:37,734
and I personally felt like my
voice wasn't being heard at all.

1297
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,169
Specifically, when
we start the challenge,

1298
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,336
and we're, like,
moving the wagon,

1299
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,838
-you guys are pushing.
-Mm-hmm.

1300
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,407
Immediately, I say, you know,
"Turn left, turn left,"

1301
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,943
and because there was a lack
of listening, a lack of trust,

1302
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,580
it ran right over my toe,
which could have been avoided.

1303
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,216
I'm gonna continuously
be in the immunity challenges,

1304
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,884
so if you guys
want to keep winning,

1305
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:57,520
you have to find a way
to, like, work with me.

1306
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,289
-"We," right?
-VENUS: All of us.

1307
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,124
-Sometimes, when you say "you,"
I don't know...
-Did I say "you"? Sorry.

1308
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,525
Yeah, sometimes
when you say "you," I just

1309
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,194
don't know if it means me
or if it means everyone.

1310
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,162
-No, no, no. I'm talking
in general, I'm talking general.
-Okay, okay.

1311
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,832
Venus, like,
I adore you as a human being,

1312
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:10,333
and I want
to have this camaraderie,

1313
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,202
and we have to have
this camaraderie

1314
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,336
for challenges.

1315
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:14,471
With that being said,

1316
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,172
she plays the victim a bit.

1317
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,308
I'm like,
"I'm not gonna baby you.

1318
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,944
That's a 'you' thing. I can't do
that work for you. I'm not you."

1319
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,980
-She's a person that takes
a long time to process.
-Right.

1320
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,082
So it's, like, imperative
that we don't take anything

1321
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,184
-she's doing personally.
-Right.

1322
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,452
Because she... this is...

1323
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,354
I've learned
this is just how she is.

1324
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,990
She-she could change on a dime
based on her emotions.

1325
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,625
-It's very clear.
-Right.

1326
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,897
VENUS:
I am a natural introvert,
but I don't think

1327
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,700
I would have this issue
with any other tribe.

1328
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,468
It's just that I...
we happen to have

1329
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,004
two really big
personalities here.

1330
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,907
I don't really know who she's
mad at. I guess everyone.

1331
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:51,941
VENUS:
Sodasia--

1332
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,676
she has a tendency...
(chuckles)

1333
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,445
to kind of want to be
the star of the show.

1334
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,614
Nami, congratulations.

1335
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,617
VENUS:
And her tendency to grab
the immunity idol from me,

1336
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,252
every time
Jeff hands it to me...

1337
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,921
Congratulations.
It's coming back.

1338
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:06,756
VENUS:
It's kind of, like,
really rude and annoying.

1339
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,625
The fact that
your first reaction is to just

1340
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:11,361
grab it for yourself--
like, it's a bit childish.

1341
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,696
You don't want to see
a pissed off version of me.

1342
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,865
I've been sad the past
three days. Now I'm just pissed.

1343
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,501
So I'm gonna work twice as hard
to work with Randen

1344
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:22,338
to use his Beware Advantage
to get to a merge,

1345
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,741
and I will flip immediately

1346
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,709
against these people.

1347
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,712
♪ ♪

1348
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,032
BHANU:
Hey.

1349
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:51,401
Tiff.

1350
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,838
No. Come on, dude.

1351
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,508
You kicked some butt there.

1352
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,777
You kicked butt there!

1353
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:03,780
(sniffles)

1354
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:08,318
TIFFANY:
I'm-a take a little walk.
I'll be back.

1355
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:09,619
Cool.

1356
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,387
(sniffles, sighs)

1357
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,071
(groans)

1358
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,242
(sniffling)

1359
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,185
I'm not crying because we lost.

1360
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:45,455
I mean, I was hurt that we lost,
but I was just even more upset

1361
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:47,991
because of the way
I lost control.

1362
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,159
That's just
not the type of player

1363
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,095
that I want to be perceived as.

1364
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,429
Like, nobody

1365
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:56,065
on the other tribes
even knows me yet.

1366
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,767
I don't want
their perception of me

1367
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,970
to be this crazy,
angry Black girl

1368
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,140
that can't keep her cool
during challenges.

1369
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,911
(sniffles) And I feel like
that's what I looked like today.

1370
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,217
But I was so broken.

1371
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:19,255
Because it's like, you're
not taking this seriously.

1372
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,224
And I can't work
with people like that.

1373
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,593
I cannot work
with people like that.

1374
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,061
KENZIE:
You want to take a second

1375
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:26,262
-or you want to talk?
-We can talk.

1376
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,563
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good.

1377
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,766
-Hey. It was not you.
-God, I'm so...

1378
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,601
-I'm so angry.
-I know.

1379
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,369
-It's just...
-It wasn't on you.

1380
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:34,637
Hey, bro.

1381
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,506
-I know.
-There were so many times
that I looked up

1382
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:39,142
during the challenge
and Jess was literally walking.

1383
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,643
-I know.
-I'm like, "Bro."

1384
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,011
KENZIE:
Tiff was down, down and out.

1385
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,446
Like, I feel

1386
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,548
for her. It's not
a good feeling, but I'm like,

1387
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,951
"We lost it. Let's move on
and talk about Tribal."

1388
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,852
-I felt the same thing.
-Like, she kept dropping 'em.

1389
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,521
Look, we can't think about that.

1390
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:53,022
We only have
a few hours until Tribal,

1391
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,357
so you and I
need to get straight.

1392
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,758
Like, what do you want to do?

1393
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:58,094
Do you want to hide an idol,
make her think she's safe

1394
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:59,729
so she doesn't play
her Shot in the Dark?

1395
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:02,532
-I feel like we don't
have a choice at this point.
-Okay.

1396
01:00:02,598 --> 01:00:04,067
I woke up this morning
with an idea

1397
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,236
that we could hide a fake idol

1398
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,105
and make Jess think she has

1399
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,174
a real idol
so that she doesn't play

1400
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,442
her Shot in the Dark.

1401
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,746
I macheted off the beads
from Jelinsky's water bottle.

1402
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,781
I tell Tiff this idea.

1403
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,184
We used the note
from Tiffany's idol

1404
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,753
and the parchment from
Tiffany's Beware Advantage.

1405
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,421
All right,
this look official to me.

1406
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:27,457
KENZIE:
Then Tiff went to hide it.

1407
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,929
The traps have been laid out.

1408
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:35,131
They are...
The carrot is in the snare.

1409
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,833
TIFFANY:
She'll think she has an idol,

1410
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:38,801
-so she won't
play her Shot in the Dark.
-Q: Right.

1411
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:42,205
KENZIE:
The only ones in on this plan
are me, Q and Tiff.

1412
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,273
-Y'all do what y'all have to do.
-TIFFANY: All right.

1413
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,508
I think it's a foolproof plan.

1414
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:46,776
Like, she's gonna find it.

1415
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:48,277
It's sticking out a little bit.
It's perfect.

1416
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,651
Honestly, I'm about
to start go looking for idols.

1417
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:56,986
Oh, my God.

1418
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,022
Do you think you're in trouble?

1419
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,423
It's Survivor.

1420
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,159
None of us
could be too comfortable.

1421
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,328
-JESS: Yeah.
-I'm scared, too, like...

1422
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,363
Guess we should
go look for the idol.

1423
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,599
TIFFANY:
We should. We absolutely should.
Come on.

1424
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,336
You don't want
to look for idols? Girl?

1425
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,038
Your name
is on the chopping block.

1426
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:17,874
At the very least, you should
be like, "Absolutely."

1427
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,610
Not "Yeah, I think so."

1428
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,581
JESS:
Oh, my God. Spider.

1429
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:28,184
-You search those rocks
over there?
-No.

1430
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,553
I led her over to the wall,

1431
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,754
and sister's over here
looking at trees.

1432
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:33,523
I'm like,
"Did you check the wall?

1433
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,757
Did you check the rock wall?"

1434
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,866
You said you don't
think it's in this area?

1435
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,568
But we literally
looked everywhere else.

1436
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:48,071
You searched
real good over there?

1437
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,139
It's right there, girl.

1438
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,275
Sis can't look for idols
to save her life.

1439
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:56,245
I literally planted the idol
in the same exact spot

1440
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,914
where I found it, and

1441
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,215
she walks right on past.

1442
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,952
I'm not gonna get this girl
to get this idol.

1443
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,826
Did you talk to her?

1444
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:16,899
Jess is not gonna find it,

1445
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:20,069
even if we had
a blinking neon sign

1446
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,672
that was like,
"There's an idol right here."

1447
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:24,807
Jess would have just, like,
walked right underneath it.

1448
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,081
Should we let Q...

1449
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:46,762
(whispering):
Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess.

1450
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,132
-Yeah?
-(whispers): Come here.

1451
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,500
Hurry, hurry.

1452
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:53,603
-Okay.
-Listen...

1453
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,976
Yes. It's my idol.

1454
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,111
-Can we go over here?
-Come on, come on, come on.

1455
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:03,846
I show Jess this fake idol,
and I tell her,

1456
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:05,214
"You have to write down
who I want."

1457
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:07,250
Okay.

1458
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,487
When I give you this,
just keep looking.

1459
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,656
-Keep looking
until we have to leave.
-I will keep looking.

1460
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:15,791
Q:
Because of my relationship
with Jess,

1461
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,793
and telling Jess that
I want us to work together,

1462
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,395
but I want no one
to know about it,

1463
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,598
has allowed me to present
this fake idol to Jess

1464
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,467
and her think it's real.

1465
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,502
-Play it cool at Tribal.
-Okay.

1466
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,337
I told you, I got your back.
Trying to help.

1467
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:31,407
Do not say that I gave you this,
we talked.

1468
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,042
You go that way.
I'm going this way.

1469
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:36,179
We should get rid of Jess
for many reasons,

1470
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,247
but I am Jess's number one.

1471
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,615
All I need to do is tell Jess

1472
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:40,983
to write down Kenzie.

1473
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,451
How do you...

1474
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,287
Come on, show me.

1475
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,755
Q:
I am Bhanu's number one.

1476
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:48,791
I have Bhanu's vote. The three
of us have enough votes.

1477
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,426
We can get Kenzie out this game.

1478
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:52,428
Okay.

1479
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,531
Q:
I have Jess on one side,
who I want going home.

1480
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,633
I have Kenzie on the other side,
who I want going home.

1481
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,069
So I know one of the two
that I want to go home...

1482
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,104
...will exit tonight.

1483
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,906
-(whoops)
-(chuckles)

1484
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,012
TIFFANY:
Man, I just want to eat.

1485
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,815
KENZIE: When we get that flint,
we're gonna be set.

1486
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:15,117
TIFFANY:
Be careful.

1487
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,186
Ow.

1488
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:19,488
-You cut yourself?
-Yeah.

1489
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,424
-Is it bad?
-Yeah, it is pretty bad.

1490
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,526
-TIFFANY: Oh, my God.
-Really, really bad.

1491
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,661
TIFFANY:
See? I told you to be careful.

1492
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:28,030
KENZIE:
We're about to go to Tribal

1493
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,633
and our best person
with the machete

1494
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,768
chops his finger open.

1495
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,136
We can't catch a break.

1496
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,872
Just the cherry on top.

1497
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:39,275
(laughs) Oh, this sucks.

1498
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,110
KENZIE:
Jess was never gonna

1499
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,613
find the fake idol, so Q

1500
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:44,880
just gave it to her.

1501
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,716
-(laughs)
-Girl, what are we working to?

1502
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:48,150
This is clown school.

1503
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,152
(snorts)

1504
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,888
You have to be smart
to go to clown school.

1505
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,290
This is remedial clown school.

1506
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:57,460
KENZIE:
It's pretty glaringly obvious

1507
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:00,329
that Q, Tiff and I
are the only people here

1508
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,398
who know anything
about the game.

1509
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,300
And we are working with...

1510
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,435
Oh, my God. There's, like,
something pointy in my neck.

1511
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:07,737
...some dinguses.

1512
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:08,771
Why can't something go right?

1513
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:10,473
Hopefully,
just go right tonight.

1514
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,341
I'm voting for Jess tonight.

1515
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,844
Not because she's a bad person,
it's just,

1516
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:16,946
she's a bad Survivor player.
It is what it is.

1517
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,050
JESS:
My game tonight relies on Q,

1518
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,219
but I'm starting to wonder,
like, I don't even know

1519
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,187
if the idol he gave me is real.

1520
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,322
It's got this

1521
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,124
thing that looks like
every adornment

1522
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,960
on every Survivor gear
that we have.

1523
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:34,063
Can you look me in the eyes and
tell me that the idol is real?

1524
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,831
I found the idol on day...

1525
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:38,167
I tell you what.
Just give it back.

1526
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,335
-(chuckles)
-No, no, no, no.

1527
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:42,038
'Cause I'm risking my idol

1528
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,839
-for you to stay.
-Okay.

1529
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:45,675
For you to question it...

1530
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,443
JESS:
I don't really have a choice
but to play it

1531
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,278
and hope that it's real.

1532
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,781
I think Kenzie's a huge threat.
She's just

1533
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,516
gonna sail to the final three
if they don't...

1534
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:54,950
if they don't get rid of her.

1535
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:58,554
But I think Tiffany and Q
are working together,

1536
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,256
so I don't think
Q would pull off

1537
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:01,390
a blindside tonight

1538
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,491
without Tiff.

1539
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:05,528
Do you think
Tiffany would vote Kenzie?

1540
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,263
That's a good question.

1541
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,298
JESS:
So I'm going
to put Kenzie's name out there,

1542
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:10,866
which is probably very stupid,

1543
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:13,235
but I need to be
playing this game as well.

1544
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,737
TIFFANY:
Like, where's your head at?

1545
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,006
I feel like nobody wants to,
like, throw out a name.

1546
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,375
There's five of us
who need three people

1547
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:20,743
-to vote one person out.
-Yeah.

1548
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,012
What's the pros and cons
of everybody?

1549
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,447
Who do you want to start with?

1550
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,949
-Um, I'll start with Bhanu.
-Yeah.

1551
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:30,419
While-while he's
a sweet, sweet soul,

1552
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,455
I think he's
a bit emotional at times.

1553
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,324
-Yeah.
-TIFFANY: Jess, pros...

1554
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,661
I'll circle back to that.

1555
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,262
Yeah, I don't know
what Jess' pros are,

1556
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,631
so I think we're pretty solid on
the fact that we want Jess out.

1557
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,834
What are
your pros and cons for Kenz?

1558
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,703
Oh, my God.
Kenz is so socially strong

1559
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,538
-that if she went to the merge,
-Yeah.

1560
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,440
she's, like, so fast
getting to everybody

1561
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,075
and bonding with them.

1562
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,411
-Is that a pro or a con, though?
-Yeah.

1563
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,680
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I don't know. I haven't
made that up in my mind yet.

1564
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:00,282
At this point,
I think Jess is kind of, like,

1565
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:03,018
floating around
and putting out feelers

1566
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,320
to see who...

1567
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,222
who will not
write her name down.

1568
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:07,890
We were talking about
pros and cons of everybody.

1569
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,358
We were on, like, Q.

1570
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,494
JESS:
Q, pros: tribe strength.

1571
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,496
-Yeah, so-so
what are y'all thinking?
-JESS: Yeah.

1572
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:15,164
TIFFANY:
It's Bhanu?

1573
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,700
I mean, what else is there?
I don't want it to be any of us.

1574
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,406
-KENZIE: But right now...
-JESS: Yeah.

1575
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:24,774
we have a chance to not lose.

1576
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,276
-BOTH: Yeah.
-KENZIE: And that
is because of Q.

1577
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:31,547
But, right now,
it's pretty essential

1578
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,616
-that we keep him.
-TIFFANY: I agree.

1579
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,551
Last Tribal,
I wanted Jess out first,

1580
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,887
and the whole way home,

1581
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:40,790
I just kept thinking to myself,

1582
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,591
"You should've
got Jess out first."

1583
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,727
-Y'all ready? Okay.
-Yeah.

1584
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:46,028
TIFFANY:
But I'm okay with that,

1585
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:47,029
because she going home

1586
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:48,230
tonight anyway, so...

1587
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:54,069
JESS:
Well, Kenz joined us.

1588
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:55,638
-What'd she say?
-Well...

1589
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:57,273
(chuckles softly)

1590
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,308
-BHANU: Jess,
you got to be open with Q.
-She pitched one of you,

1591
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,677
-and it was... you.
-Q: Okay.

1592
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,748
BHANU:
Bro, this is not nice.

1593
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,049
I don't like this.

1594
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,385
I don't like
to have my name out there.

1595
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:12,188
I just don't understand.
Why me?

1596
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,191
I'm giving my blood,
sweat and tears to this tribe,

1597
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,660
and when... and the result,
outcome is this?

1598
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,095
Just because
I'm a little emotional

1599
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,631
doesn't mean that
you guys vote me out.

1600
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,169
(whispers):
Like, we need to vote her out.

1601
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:28,871
She's playing you like a fiddle.

1602
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,141
BHANU:
I'm very nervous, because
Jess and I just started

1603
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,976
talking strategy,
and I don't know

1604
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,678
if she's gonna
stick to the plan

1605
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:37,112
to blindside Kenzie.

1606
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:38,981
What do you say

1607
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:40,950
that I can trust you with this,

1608
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:43,252
that you're gonna
not gonna go back and talk

1609
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,553
to Kenzie about our plan?

1610
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,388
How can I trust that?

1611
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:49,191
Jess...

1612
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:50,626
Q: So what'd they say about me?

1613
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:53,562
They want to keep you 'cause
you're strong. (chuckles softly)

1614
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,231
Q:
Oh, because I'm strong, huh?

1615
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,632
But then, at some point,
it won't matter

1616
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,667
-how strong any of us are.
-Q: Right.

1617
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,974
See, Tiff has to be on board.

1618
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,610
-You're right.
-JESS: Yeah.

1619
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:10,579
Bhanu, you're not
going anywhere. Trust me.

1620
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,382
I have Jess and Bhanu's vote,

1621
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:14,750
but the problem is this.

1622
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,753
Bhanu and Jess
are both liabilities,

1623
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,388
so I need Tiff. I need her.

1624
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,357
I need her
to be on the same page as me.

1625
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,298
-For real?
-Yeah, that's what she said.

1626
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:32,034
Damn. That's crazy.

1627
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:34,637
-Yeah.
-Yo, Kenzie is definitely
intimidated by you.

1628
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:36,238
Kenzie wants me to herself.

1629
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:38,507
What'd Kenzie say?

1630
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:40,876
Well, no, she didn't
say anything specific to me.

1631
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:43,812
She just, like,
she'll make comments like,

1632
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,514
"You're my number one, right?"

1633
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:46,882
I'm like,
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah," like...

1634
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,418
But, no, I-I do...
I can pick up on the fact

1635
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:51,120
that she's intimidated
by our relationship.

1636
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:54,056
Man, I don't trust
that girl now, bro.

1637
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:55,858
Let me get, uh, closer to you.

1638
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,395
Q:
Kenzie don't like
that I am Tiff's number one.

1639
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,164
Eventually, she's gonna
get jealous. Why not just

1640
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,400
get rid of this problem
before it's an actual problem?

1641
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:05,868
Kenzie don't
really want me here.

1642
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:07,369
-I'm telling you.
-TIFFANY: You don't
think she do?

1643
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:08,938
Hell no.
She want me here now

1644
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:11,173
-because of the strength.
-Huh.

1645
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,475
We go to the merge,
she will get rid of me

1646
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,144
-in a heartbeat.
-TIFFANY: Kenzie's

1647
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,079
super loyal to me.

1648
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,982
I don't know
if she's as loyal to Q.

1649
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,217
And that's where
the divide comes.

1650
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,386
Q wants her out ASAP,

1651
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,821
but is it too soon?

1652
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,357
Q:
Somebody don't want me here
and I can feel it,

1653
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,159
I can't play with them.

1654
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:31,427
...

1655
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:33,629
Q:
I don't trust Kenzie

1656
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:34,897
and she doesn't trust me.

1657
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:37,266
But here's the deal.
I'm in the middle.

1658
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,668
I have two plans going
and I don't know which plan

1659
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:40,970
we're gonna execute.

1660
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,906
Keeping Jess means
I have a loyal number.

1661
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,542
She's someone
who can vote with me, but

1662
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,977
I have to babysit a lot more.

1663
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,879
If we keep Kenzie,
I don't have to do much work.

1664
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,114
She's a self-starter.

1665
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,716
Kenzie's gonna
go on the other side

1666
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:55,117
and bring in numbers,

1667
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,786
but those numbers
might not benefit me.

1668
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:00,055
I have to figure out
which one will be the best

1669
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,558
for my endgame, and
I have to figure it out quick.

01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:43,966
the unique aspects
of Survivor is that

1674
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,534
you have to play this game,

1675
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:47,436
live in these conditions,
with people

1676
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:50,973
you may not normally
want to even be around.

1677
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,242
Jeff, we have to rely on
each other in these conditions.

1678
01:11:53,308 --> 01:11:54,510
We don't have anybody else.

1679
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,779
We have to use
each other's resourcefulness.

1680
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:59,915
Bhanu even cut his finger with a
machete today, just to feed us.

1681
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,618
-Like, we're learning to...
-You mean he fed you
part of his flesh?

1682
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,653
(laughing)

1683
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,922
I wish.
I really need the protein.

1684
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:11,060
PROBST:
So, Kenzie, you're
always relying on each other,

1685
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,928
even though you're
voting each other out,

1686
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,564
and that's part of what
makes it so complicated.

1687
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,533
KENZIE:
Yeah, it is complicated
because we all

1688
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:19,535
genuinely enjoy each other,

1689
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:21,570
but, like,
now we're having to choose

1690
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:23,672
who can we work with
long-term in gameplay.

1691
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,376
It's hard, but that's
the reality of the game.

1692
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:31,814
Tiffany, Kenzie was very
specific in saying, "Right now,

1693
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,984
we have to decide who we can
play this game with long-term."

1694
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:39,822
I agree with her. I'm a person
who-who acts off of data.

1695
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:41,824
And if we look at the data,

1696
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,294
we have lost
every challenge we competed in.

1697
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,797
So we would be fools
not to think about

1698
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,333
who can we play this game
with beyond

1699
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,335
the tribe stage of the game.

1700
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:56,205
Wow. I'm trying to think
if there's been a tribe

1701
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:59,441
that has admitted this
publicly in front of each other,

1702
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,610
especially
this early in the game.

1703
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,180
So, Jess, does
it frighten you that it could

1704
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:08,283
come down tonight,
potentially, to relationships

1705
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,986
-that people are
thinking about days from now?
-JESS: Yeah.

1706
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,856
It's a dog-eat-dog world
out here,

1707
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:16,859
and I don't know
that we have our stuff together

1708
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:18,093
to win
the next immunity challenge.

1709
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,361
We have to be realistic,

1710
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:21,797
and we have to think about
how to move forward.

1711
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:24,566
And it sucks because Kenzie
and I have not talked strategy.

1712
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,136
We've been kind of
tiptoeing around each other.

1713
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:28,437
I described it as, like,

1714
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:30,405
we're dancing
without touching each other.

1715
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,074
-It's really weird.
-(Kenzie chuckles)

1716
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,175
It's weird 'cause we're both,

1717
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,743
like, the smallest people
on the tribe,

1718
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,112
-and, like, everybody thinks
that you're their BFF,
-Yeah.

1719
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,447
and you're just amazing.

1720
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:42,317
Like, you're-you're going
to eat everybody moving forward.

1721
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:43,952
-Like...
-KENZIE: Yeah.

1722
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,687
I love that you pointed that out
to everyone.

1723
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,223
-I should've said this
to your face.
-KENZIE: It's fine. It's okay,

1724
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,925
but it doesn't, like,
make me want to be like,

1725
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,860
"So, what do you want to do?

1726
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,463
"Throw me under the bus?
Beautiful.

1727
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,064
Love it. Let's dance."

1728
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:59,234
So, no, I didn't want to talk
strategy with you today.

1729
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:01,937
PROBST:
Wow, so, Q,

1730
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,972
I'm guessing
you didn't anticipate

1731
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,008
Tribal Council
was gonna go exactly like this.

1732
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:07,976
You know, Jess, in her mind,

1733
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,244
she thinks she's in trouble.

1734
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:10,746
So now she's saying, "Okay,

1735
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,315
"if I'm going out,
I want everybody to be aware

1736
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:16,385
of what is a hidden threat
within this camp."

1737
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:18,720
And if that's her truth,
that's her truth.

1738
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,457
Let's talk
about today's challenge.

1739
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,092
Tiffany, you were so frustrated

1740
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,161
you said,
"I'm not even gonna talk,"

1741
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,597
which is a normal situation.

1742
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:31,733
When you lose like this,
if you're not frustrated

1743
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,037
or a little angry,
then you're not in it.

1744
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,104
Yeah.

1745
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,941
I was-I was devastated
after that loss.

1746
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:40,609
I willed myself
through that challenge.

1747
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:43,679
I gave everything I had.

1748
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,781
So to still do that and lose,

1749
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,483
like, it-it broke me, like...

1750
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,485
So I knew at the end,
when we were

1751
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:54,022
just standing there,
I was upset from the loss

1752
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:56,992
and I knew that we were
coming back here tonight.

1753
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:01,196
I knew it was better for me
to just shut up in that moment

1754
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:04,700
than to say something stupid
that I would want to take back.

1755
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:08,770
Bhanu, you had no problem
releasing your emotions today.

1756
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,572
Jeff, I'm a very
passionate person.

1757
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,741
What's in here is here.

1758
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:13,942
I get that a lot.

1759
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,744
"Oh, Bhanu is emotional.
He's crying.

1760
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,646
He's weak."

1761
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:21,116
Do you know
how much courage it takes

1762
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,352
for someone to just
show their emotions?

1763
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:27,155
I'm showing all my courage.
I'm showing my true self.

1764
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:30,025
I'm authentic. And tonight,
I'm holding my tears

1765
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:31,393
and I don't want
to get emotional

1766
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:35,097
because, Jeff, I heard someone
in the tribe saying that,

1767
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:38,300
"Oh, Bhanu, he's-he's weak.
He's too emotional."

1768
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,470
If this passion, if this emotion
is making you feel like,

1769
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:42,838
"Oh, my God, you're too...

1770
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,474
You're-you're too this,
you're too that," I'm sorry.

1771
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,976
I'm so sorry.

1772
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,612
But this is me,
the passionate me.

1773
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,149
So are you saying you think
you're in trouble tonight?

1774
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,217
-Because...
-Absolutely.

1775
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,686
I'm 100% on the chopping block
tonight,

1776
01:15:57,753 --> 01:16:00,889
but tell me where
I'm failing in this tribe.

1777
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:03,525
They know that I'm reliable.
They know that I'm trustworthy.

1778
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:06,128
They know that I'm honest.
They know that I'm disciplined.

1779
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:08,096
They know that I'm hardworking.

1780
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,066
When you close, it's what?

1781
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:13,535
-It's a strength. It's a power.
-I feel it.

1782
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:17,172
I've told them. I had these
conversations with Tiffany,

1783
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,575
with Q, of course,
Kenzie as well.

1784
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:25,113
And I told them,
individually and together,

1785
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,983
"Work with me.
I want to work with you."

1786
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:31,420
Bhanu, I got to say something,
because you've done this twice,

1787
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,422
so I don't feel
like I'm stepping

1788
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:34,756
-into your game too much.
-Please. Please.

1789
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:37,392
You appear
to be very forthcoming

1790
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:38,694
about who you're tight with.

1791
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,462
At the first Tribal Council,

1792
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,564
you were blurting out
lots of things and saying,

1793
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:44,900
"Let's just vote
'cause it's Jelinsky."

1794
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,269
And just now,
what I've gathered is

1795
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:51,039
you have an alliance
with Kenzie, Q and Tiffany.

1796
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,041
So how about Jess?

1797
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:56,311
Jess and I...
Oh, how can I explain this?

1798
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:59,614
I only connected
with Jess yesterday.

1799
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,383
Yeah.

1800
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:06,254
So, Q,
what do you make of Tribal now?

1801
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:09,358
Q:
Jeff, we have
to be very, very careful

1802
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:11,526
of what we say
when we sit in this seat.

1803
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:14,463
The emotions don't
have to come out all the time.

1804
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:16,865
Being able to control them
is just as powerful

1805
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,000
as letting 'em out.

1806
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:20,369
Jeff, the only reason
why I said this

1807
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:22,471
is because this is our tribe.

1808
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:25,340
If we're in a merge,
I'm not gonna say, like,

1809
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:28,043
"Oh, they said this..."
This is just our tribe.

1810
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,045
This is Yanu.

1811
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:32,047
Once I say it, I'm done with it.

1812
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:35,650
-Right, but it's gonna come
a time where you can't say it.
-But what Q's saying...

1813
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,353
It's gonna have to stay here.
It can't come out of the mouth.

1814
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,589
I can do that, too.
I'm training myself.

1815
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:42,958
If Jess now feels like

1816
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,894
we're all in an alliance
and she's going home,

1817
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,363
what if she pulls out an idol
and write my name down?

1818
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,033
You see how
that kind of plays itself?

1819
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:54,336
Q, I understand that,
but I also trust in

1820
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,138
my connection with Jess.

1821
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,110

01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:25,053
not a hidden immunity idol.

1837
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,254
Any votes cast for Jess

1838
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:27,355
will still count.

1839
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:28,356
(both laugh)

1840
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:30,492
All right, I'll read the votes.

1841
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,430
First vote: Bhanu.

1842
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:45,273
Jess. One vote Bhanu,
one vote Jess.

1843
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:53,415
That's two votes Jess,
one vote Bhanu.

1844
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:59,387
Second person voted out
of Survivor 46: Jess.

1845
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:00,655
Oh, man.

1846
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,524
You guys are so good.

1847
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,162
Oh, my God.

(groans)

1849
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,474
-Jess...
-(laughs)

1850
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,810
-You okay?
-This, just, whole thing
is so surreal.

1851
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:22,978
Yeah, I'm okay.

1852
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:24,980
The tribe has spoken.

1853
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,684
Time for you to go.

1854
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,020
-Bye, Jess.
-Bye, Jess.
-JESS (laughs): Bye.

1855
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,658
Geez Louise.

1856
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,266
Grab your torches
and head back to camp.

1857
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:46,268
Good night.

a really sweet dude.

I can see right through

Next time on Survivor...

Oh, my God.

This is out of control.

She's like this mermaid dragon.

1870
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:29,444
I got got.
Those people are masterminds.

1871
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:30,712
That was incredible.

1872
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,147
So, if there's anything
I could take away

1873
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,382
from my experience,
it's that I should have started

1874
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,184
strategizing
at the very beginning,

1875
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,520
but I had an amazing time
playing Survivor.

1876
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:40,455
I really enjoyed
getting to know everybody.

1877
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,590
I've had a blast out here.
Even though, like, my face

1878
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:43,792
might not convey it.

1879
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:46,428
I-I don't have
enough calories to smile.
