1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,601
...After a surprise elimination.

2
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:02,869
I'm angry here.

3
00:00:02,994 --> 00:00:05,208
There, I will have to play 
from the bottom of the ladder.

4
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,581
In the Gen X tribe,

5
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,051
David found an idol...

6
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:11,176
...and thought 
maybe he should use it.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:13,680
Clearly, Ken, Cece and I 
are at the bottom of the ladder.

8
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:17,115
But Jessica wanted to turn 
against the majority alliance.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,378
Paul is not with us. 
He's with the guys.

10
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:22,288
Eliminating Paul 
would be best for our tribe.

11
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:25,892
At the council,

12
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:29,402
sunday and lucy 
suivirent le plan de jessica

13
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,363
and eliminated Paul...

14
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:33,375
Paul, the tribe has spoken.

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,145
...taking Bret and Chris 
by surprise.

16
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:38,735
There are 17 left.

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,930
Who will be eliminated tonight?

18
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,168
I would like to speak.

19
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:02,270
I'm not talking to you tonight.

20
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,329
We'll see tomorrow morning.

21
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:05,832
Upon returning from the council,

22
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,757
I was downright pissed.

23
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,056
It was quite a surprise.

24
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:12,772
I was close to 
throwing the rice in the ocean

25
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:16,142
and create 
my own one person tribe.

26
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:17,758
What the hell happened?

27
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:19,245
He held the reins.

28
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,775
No one is speaking! 
No more whispers! Come on, come on!

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,499
It has nothing to do with you two.

30
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:25,160
We want to know what's going on.

31
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,363
This is the problem 
we were facing.

32
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,728
Straight in the eye, Paul said to me:

33
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:32,421
"If the guys 
want an alliance of guys,

34
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:33,693
Good luck to you."

35
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:36,287
- He didn't promise me anything. 
- Never anything like this.

36
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:38,786
Today, 
some are very unhappy.

37
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,600
Especially Bret and Chris.

38
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,548
I don't know if they believe me.

39
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:44,437
For now, 
there is too much anger.

40
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,081
It's painful, believe me,

41
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,587
it was not an easy decision 
for anyone.

42
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:49,743
We would have said so.

43
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,553
I am very nervous.

44
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,679
I hope...

45
00:01:52,804 --> 00:01:55,115
...that it wasn't 
a bad idea.

46
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,781
Did we make a mistake?

47
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:09,061
Let's forget the past. 
Moving forward.

48
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:13,617
This morning, I felt bad, 
because Bret and Chris feel betrayed.

49
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:17,012
It's almost 
like cheating on someone

50
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,639
and 
that the relationship now needs to be repaired.

51
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:23,743
- We can patch things up, do you think? 
- Yeah, you just have to...

52
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:26,083
- Give them time? 
- Yeah.

53
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,336
The guys are furious 
because they really trusted Jessica.

54
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,703
And honestly, 
I don't have 100% confidence in her.

55
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:34,262
She the first

56
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,956
implanted in my head 
the idea of ​​voting for Paul.

57
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,568
She didn't do it by accident.

58
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:42,128
It's like she's trying 
to take control.

59
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:46,007
I feel like I 
have to fix it.

60
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,235
So, as far as I'm concerned,

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,604
Sorry, you know, it's a game.

62
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,603
- No need to apologize. 
- I know your worth.

63
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:56,142
But I can also tell you

64
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:59,867
that the power-hungry 
had to pull out a power-hungry.

65
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,579
But now you know 
who is trying to take over.

66
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:04,851
Lucy arrives and says:

67
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,175
"Jessica is 
pulling the strings."

68
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,198
Jess plays it hard, 
and I applaud him for it.

69
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:13,457
But now 
you've played your cards.

70
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:15,161
I want you to know

71
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:17,864
that Ken and Dave 
trust me completely.

72
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:20,997
So if you have plans...

73
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:23,370
- Can you make them? 
- I can make them, yes.

74
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,794
I don't trust Jess.

75
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,074
Yes, but know that I can...

76
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,310
- Understood. 
- You understand?

77
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:33,576
Lucy thinks she has Dave and Ken 
in her pocket

78
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,116
and that maybe we could take 
action against Jess.

79
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,425
I don't like Jess.

80
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,952
I can not stand her.

81
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:41,821
So if I can help 
make her squirt, I will.

82
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:44,200
Next tip...

83
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:46,489
She needs to get out.

84
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:07,781
I'm losing my mind, I'm so hungry.

85
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,817
Go hunt that pig, 
whatever it is, if necessary.

86
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:13,248
Do you really think 
there's a pig on this island?

87
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:15,321
We saw pig tracks 
on the beach.

88
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:18,558
The definition of a Gen Y would be:

89
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:22,362
a young man full of dreams, 
ready to conquer the world.

90
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,037
Let's kill a pig!

91
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:26,761
And I like it, 
because I'm a dreamer.

92
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:28,168
Gen X is like:

93
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:31,150
"Okay, high school, college, 
subway, job,

94
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:33,273
build yourself a life!" 
I don't want that.

95
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:36,685
Wait, did you hear?

96
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:39,054
- It's a goat. 
- Where is she?

97
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,714
- Where is she? 
- The!

98
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,239
She's up there!

99
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,926
She is on the way.

100
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,052
Oh my God!

101
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,597
- Let's go to the hill side. 
- Let's go catch it!

102
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,557
- Speak softly! 
- I say!

103
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:52,576
There, up there!

104
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:53,901
Oh my God!

105
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,838
They don't really hunt, do they?

106
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,893
The search for the idol 
has really slowed down on this camp.

107
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,437
But I feel like 
she could still be there.

108
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:08,074
So I think I have 
to dedicate myself to his research.

109
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,313
Because after the elimination of Mari,

110
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,889
I clearly have my 
head on the block.

111
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,249
What if I could 
get my hands on an idol,

112
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,252
I could save myself.

113
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:22,931
Oh my...

114
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,138
Oh my...!

115
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:26,796
Oh my God!

116
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,561
I knew it!

117
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:30,585
By the way, I knew it!

118
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,731
Oh my God!

119
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,983
I can't open it!

120
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,258
Too excited!

121
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:40,283
"Mother Nature hides your security.

122
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,593
Your tribe's crest 
marks power.

123
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,911
The coveted prize is shelled."

124
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:47,046
Lord! 
She couldn't be here?

125
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,615
I still have to search?

126
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,828
It's incredible.

127
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:52,619
For a super-hyper 
Survivor fan like me,

128
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,188
it's absolutely a dream.

129
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,957
I found the clue. 
All that remains is to decipher it.

130
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:00,395
Always nothing?

131
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,604
- Nope. 
- No goat.

132
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,431
I don't know how long

133
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:06,066
I can lose looking for it.

134
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:08,181
So I have to go back to camp

135
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:10,345
and search another time.

136
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,090
Over here, everyone!

137
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,764
Gen Y, discover

138
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,900
the new Gen X tribe.

139
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,460
Paul was eliminated

140
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:34,994
at the last tip.

141
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,364
- Wow, I didn't see that coming! 
- Neither do I.

142
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:44,579
Ready for 
today's reward event?

143
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:49,651
Today 
you will collect a ring.

144
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:53,698
Then you'll come back 
to your flag

145
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:56,773
while the other tribe 
will try to stop you

146
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:59,154
in every possible way.

147
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:02,905
The first 
to have a hand on the flag

148
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,624
and another on the ring

149
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:06,776
scores a point for his team.

150
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:09,062
The first to three points 
win the reward.

151
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:11,139
- Want to know what's at stake? 
- Yes!

152
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,673
I think you'll like it.

153
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,604
sausages,

154
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:21,341
- vegetables, spices. 
- Spices!

155
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:22,631
A grill!

156
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,744
- Laugh. 
- Any!

157
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,212
Is it worth it?

158
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:27,889
Okay, Gen Y,

159
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,050
you are one more. 
Who will not participate?

160
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,459
Who will it be?

161
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,061
It will be Michelle.

162
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,681
The others, one minute 
to get organized and we'll start.

163
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:48,234
Well, on and go.

164
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,836
Two men

165
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:51,471
against two men.

166
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:54,049
It will be Chris and David

167
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,985
against Jay and Adam.

168
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,646
From the outset, 
an interesting confrontation.

169
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:02,772
Alright, round one.

170
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:04,517
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?

171
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,819
There are big waves.

172
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:11,967
You'll have to swim to the ring.

173
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,074
Jay goes straight for Chris.

174
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,337
He blocks it. 
Chris tries to push him away

175
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:19,040
like an insect.

176
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,701
That leaves Adam 
free to go to the ring.

177
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:24,104
Excellent Gen Y strategy.

178
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:27,125
Jay sacrifices his body.

179
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:28,975
Adam is in trouble now.

180
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,920
He sees a clumsy attacking him.

181
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,390
And very easily, 
Adam gives up the ring.

182
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,217
There is no photo.

183
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,559
Chris holds Jay and Adam,

184
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,997
allowing David to return.

185
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,223
Come on, Dave!

186
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:44,812
Grab his fingers, Adam!

187
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:46,468
Chris is unstoppable.

188
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,243
He gives David 
all the time he needs.

189
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:52,566
The first point goes to Gen X!

190
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,442
The women.

191
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:58,938
Sunday and Cece

192
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:02,075
against Figgy and Michaela.

193
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:03,952
On and go.

194
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,386
Survivors, ready?

195
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:09,574
Michaela and Figgy leave quickly.

196
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,494
Cece is going to stay back 
and play defense.

197
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:15,631
Sunday also remains behind.

198
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:19,668
They let Gen Y 
do the work and bring the ring back.

199
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,062
- Advance 
- Sunday, advance!

200
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,380
This is where the game gets interesting.

201
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:29,110
Michaela throws to Figgy.

202
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,870
It's Figgy versus Cece.

203
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:36,175
Is Cece strong enough 
to come back to her flag?

204
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:38,511
Now 
the battle can begin.

205
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:41,921
Michaela shoots and gets closer.

206
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:45,444
Michaela and Figgy 
approach the flag.

207
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:47,028
Cece and Sunday

208
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,322
try to hold them back, but to no avail.

209
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:52,418
Michaela has her sights set!

210
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,576
Can she get there?

211
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,698
Gen Y score, draw!

212
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:04,779
Next round:

213
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,931
Bret and Ken for Gen X,

214
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,985
an excited Taylor and Will

215
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,111
for Gen Y.

216
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,995
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?

217
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,791
Everyone rushes towards the ring.

218
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,916
No one stays behind.

219
00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:21,196
Taylor intercepts Ken.

220
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:23,665
He knocks him out,

221
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,425
giving Will an opening.

222
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,137
Taylor, very aggressive, holds Bret back.

223
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:31,664
Now Ken is going after Will.

224
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:36,686
Ken snatched the ring from Will!

225
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:39,895
Taylor is now 
restrained by Bret.

226
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:43,555
Taylor can't 
get away from Bret,

227
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,453
Will rattrapper Ken.

228
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,513
Come on, Ken!

229
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:48,950
Taylor breaks free from Bret, 
he's on it.

230
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:50,383
There, there is a battle!

231
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:52,352
Ken does the forcing.

232
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,605
Bret helps him shoot.

233
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:56,828
The Gen X are very close.

234
00:10:56,953 --> 00:10:57,957
Come on, Bret!

235
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:00,468
Can they get there? 
Taylor counterattacks.

236
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,062
Will shoots as well.

237
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:06,170
Ken scores for Gen X!

238
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:07,901
The Gen X take the lead.

239
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,373
Next round:

240
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:15,241
it will be Jessica and Lucy

241
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:18,153
against Michaela and Hannah.

242
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:21,481
Gen X leads 2-1. 
We go to three points.

243
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,524
They can win now.

244
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,659
On and go.

245
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,962
Survivors, ready?

246
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,696
Jessica swims towards the ring.

247
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:34,707
Hannah attacks Lucy 
and tries to restrain her.

248
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,129
Lucy escapes.

249
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:38,346
Jessica is all alone.

250
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:47,650
Lucy attempts to restrain 
Michaela and Hannah.

251
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,747
Michaela takes her top off 
so she can attack Jessica.

252
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,217
Michaela is now 
facing Jessica.

253
00:11:57,741 --> 00:11:59,581
She tries to grab the ring.

254
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:02,288
Gen Y must score, 
they are trailing 2 - 1.

255
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,391
Huge in-game reward.

256
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:08,365
Lucy tries to pull them closer.

257
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:10,697
This way! This way!

258
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,042
Lucy tries to get rid of Hannah.

259
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,269
She has the flag in sight.

260
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:19,673
Michaela pulls her back 
now.

261
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:23,148
Michaela pulls him away from the flag.

262
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,745
Michaela is on!

263
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,051
Michaela gives it her all!

264
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:32,485
All!

265
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:36,364
She can equalize for Gen Y!

266
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:38,058
It's epic!

267
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,435
Michaela succeeds!

268
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,412
Gen Y equalize! 2 - 2!

269
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,127
Huge effort from Michaela,

270
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:48,710
who lost her top in the operation

271
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,725
- without it stopping him. 
- Oh my God!

272
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,915
That's what it takes 
to win in Survivor!

273
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,916
Cheer! 
You literally gave it your all!

274
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,134
We go to the test of strength.

275
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,909
It's quits or double.

276
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:04,386
It's David and Chris 
versus Jay and Zeke.

277
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:05,938
Come on, Hulk!

278
00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:10,290
Considerable pressure 
is exerted on Jay and Zeke.

279
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,194
Let's go. For the reward. 
Survivors, ready?

280
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:28,236
Zeke, the smallest of the four,

281
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:32,520
attacks Chris, 
just trying to annoy him,

282
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,357
to harass him.

283
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,750
And it works!

284
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,762
Jay has the ring.

285
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,688
Jay has an opening!

286
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:44,263
Zeke is doing a great job 
with Chris!

287
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,372
Now 
Chris takes the ring from Jay.

288
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,731
Come on, Jay!

289
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:55,235
We are close!

290
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:57,671
A huge battle!

291
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:01,182
Zeke makes things very difficult.

292
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,642
A big wave is coming!

293
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,454
She gets everyone on board.

294
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:10,227
Gen Y are closer than ever.

295
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,868
Zeke holds Chris back.

296
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,123
Chris escapes.

297
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:18,358
He has the ring.

298
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:20,719
Jay holds it again.

299
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,826
Chris pulls it now.

300
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:26,308
Chris approaches.

301
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:29,711
A big turnaround, 
and another wave!

302
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,286
Who brings them together!

303
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:35,099
That's it!

304
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,979
Gen X earn the reward!

305
00:14:55,357 --> 00:14:57,372
It was a colossal ordeal!

306
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,141
Gen X come out victorious.

307
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,601
A great reward,

308
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:03,827
who will be waiting for you at the camp.

309
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:06,706
- Enjoy it, it's deserved. 
- Thank you, Jeff!

310
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:08,749
- Cheer. 
- Thanks. Good luck.

311
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,769
Gen Y, I have nothing for you. 
Take your things and leave.

312
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:26,582
Nice job, friends.

313
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:27,994
Michaela ripped it all up.

314
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:30,917
- There wasn't much to do. 
- The girls tore everything up.

315
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,633
The last group, you, you, 
you were the last, I believe,

316
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,777
it was so tight!

317
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,414
The reward event 
was a nightmare from the start.

318
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:43,720
Their guys are huge.

319
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,940
Chris must be 
three times my height.

320
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:49,839
- He lifted me up and threw me! 
- Yeah, boom! With one hand!

321
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:51,284
We got demolished.

322
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,961
Michaela, on the other hand,

323
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,654
is like an Amazon.

324
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,008
Champion! 
It was impressive!

325
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,681
Michaela, the champion!

326
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:01,027
I'm one of those who... 
I like to win, you know?

327
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,970
And when stuff happens,

328
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,708
like my bathing suit 
getting ripped off,

329
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,090
we can either lose,

330
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:10,510
or get the shirt ripped off 
and win.

331
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,293
So I thought to myself...

332
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:14,374
"They're going to see boobs 
today!"

333
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:17,078
- We lacked strategy. 
- It's true.

334
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:19,972
- We learned our lesson. 
- Better organized, we could have won.

335
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:22,115
I would have liked 
to do a better performance.

336
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,139
But it was not 
a test for me.

337
00:16:24,264 --> 00:16:25,719
I'm not super comfortable

338
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:27,954
with physical clashes.

339
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,450
I'm going to wash these shoes.

340
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:34,060
I feel like I need 
this idol more than ever.

341
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,831
But I have little time left,

342
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,641
'cause I have to make sure I find her

343
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:41,601
before we go back to the board 
or get mixed up.

344
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:43,937
"The crest of your tribe 
marks power."

345
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:45,939
This is the emblem of the tribe.

346
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:47,941
"The coveted prize is shelled."

347
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:49,923
"Encrusted". Shellfish.

348
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:52,854
The clue says to seek

349
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:54,890
the emblem of the tribe

350
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,292
somewhere in the indicated area

351
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,767
and look for a seashell.

352
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,730
If you open the seashell, 
you will find the immunity idol.

353
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:05,048
No. 
Back to the beach.

354
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,027
I search everywhere

355
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,462
and I don't see it. 
He is not there.

356
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,901
So I walk along the beach,

357
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:15,544
hoping to spot something, 
find something.

358
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,222
That's the emblem of the tribe!

359
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,915
That's what I wanted!

360
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:35,830
Come on, open up!

361
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:40,459
I have to go back to camp!

362
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,201
I no longer need you.

363
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:49,667
You can leave.

364
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,250
Yeah, that'll do.

365
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,771
Hey, Adam!

366
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,188
Oh, don't!

367
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:58,747
How 
's your idol search going?

368
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,122
I'm working on it!

369
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,040
Good luck, friend!

370
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,811
I hope she didn't corner me.

371
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:07,832
Has she seen me with this?

372
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:16,515
Oh my God!

373
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:19,361
I'll put it 
on, just for fun!

374
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,329
I found an immunity idol!

375
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:23,945
It's beyond my wildest dreams.

376
00:18:24,195 --> 00:18:27,107
I finally started looking for 
it today, and I found it!

377
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:29,396
Mom, this is for you.

378
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:30,777
I love you so.

379
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,002
The decision to come here 
was very hard to make.

380
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:36,911
My mother was diagnosed, 
seven months ago,

381
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,094
stage 4 lung cancer.

382
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:42,069
This disease wreaks such havoc!

383
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:48,424
It was such a nightmare!

384
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:55,777
It's the worst thing imaginable.

385
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:02,970
As my biggest dream 
comes true

386
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:06,636
as 
my worst nightmare arrives,

387
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:10,886
it's not... It seems unreal.

388
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,571
My mom is a huge super-fan.

389
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:18,600
She is my ultimate reason for being here.

390
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:22,537
I want to give my mother 
something to look forward to.

391
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:25,165
That she can see me finding this,

392
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,342
that's why I came.

393
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,067
To bring 
some joy back to my family.

394
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,846
Everyone kept their sausages.

395
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:41,915
Sausages for breakfast!

396
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,015
We 
have peppers, onions left...

397
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,853
I had not been so happy here.

398
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,256
Anyone need some water?

399
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:52,367
It's good for me.

400
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:01,409
Have you spoken to anyone about...?

401
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:03,670
In case we lose?

402
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,668
I won't give you 
a name right away.

403
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:10,074
- I don't want... to talk. 
- Yes yes.

404
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:12,469
I took a walk with Lucy 
today,

405
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:15,208
to try to get an idea 
of ​​what she has in mind.

406
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,155
'Cause even though I survived 
the last tip,

407
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,263
I'm afraid that Ken and I 
remain at the bottom of the ladder.

408
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,796
So the smartest 
thing for me to do, for now,

409
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,571
it is to go 
in the direction of the majority.

410
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,645
You two have nothing to fear.

411
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,771
OK.

412
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,064
What do you have in mind?

413
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,233
Where Jessica came from.

414
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:35,769
You two don't have 
to be paranoid.

415
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:38,163
Then I don't want to see you 
talking to anyone else.

416
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:40,140
Otherwise, it will upset me.

417
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:42,290
- OK. 
- That's all.

418
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:43,818
It suits you?

419
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,922
Everyone is in on it.

420
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:48,343
- Are you going to tell him? 
- Nope.

421
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:52,285
Because if you do, 
no one will trust you.

422
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,411
I say.

423
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,646
- OK? 
- Thanks.

424
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:58,934
Lucy approached me and Dave

425
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,734
"We're going to eliminate Jess."

426
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,360
What really pissed me off,

427
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:05,298
is that Lucy 
had a kind of list of rules

428
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:07,403
on what we had the right 
to do or not.

429
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:09,169
"Don't talk to that person!"

430
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:11,639
"Don't sneak over there!" 
"Don't go alone!"

431
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:12,839
And I say to myself:

432
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:15,917
"We went 
from one dictator to another."

433
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,610
And it doesn't work for me.

434
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:31,191
Over here, everyone!

435
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,739
What is that?

436
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,747
Let's come to the 
immunity test of the day.

437
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,107
First of all, Zeke,

438
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:48,675
I take back the idol.

439
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,021
See you soon!

440
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:51,878
"See you soon",

441
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:53,453
they say, Gen X!

442
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,585
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

443
00:21:58,835 --> 00:21:59,919
Today,

444
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:03,219
you will go through a series of obstacles 
until you reach a chair.

445
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:05,960
Your tribe 
will then raise the chair,

446
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:09,704
allowing you to collect 
ten numbered bags.

447
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:12,132
Then the next one goes.

448
00:22:12,257 --> 00:22:14,609
Once the 30 bags have been collected,

449
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:18,248
you will form a sentence 
with the letters they contain.

450
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:20,373
The first tribe to achieve this

451
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,616
wins immunity, 
is immune from voting.

452
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,309
The losers will go to the council, 
where someone will be eliminated from the game.

453
00:22:26,434 --> 00:22:28,356
Gen Y, you are one more.

454
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,058
Who will not participate?

455
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:33,995
Adam, on the bench. The others, 
one minute to get organized

456
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,470
and we'll start.

457
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,697
Well, on and go.

458
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:45,040
For immunity.

459
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:46,296
Survivors, ready?

460
00:22:50,657 --> 00:22:51,905
First, the obstacles.

461
00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:54,716
Chris makes 
it look very easy.

462
00:22:57,979 --> 00:23:00,222
Chris quickly crosses the obstacle.

463
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,426
Chris is in the chair. 
Start shooting, Gen X!

464
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,953
The one, the one!

465
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:08,588
If you can lift Chris, 
you can lift everyone!

466
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:11,519
Figgy is in the chair, 
she goes to get the one.

467
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,030
You have to take them in order, 
from 1 to 10, then come back.

468
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:18,640
Leftmost!

469
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:24,088
Chris must be 
three times the weight of Figgy.

470
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:25,538
I'm almost there, shoot!

471
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:29,876
- At the top! 
- To the left!

472
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:31,386
I got it!

473
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,388
Chris has two. 
Figgy has two.

474
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:34,689
Perfect equality.

475
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,625
Chris has three.

476
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,184
Top, all right!

477
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,508
Gen X leads, 
they have number four.

478
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:42,230
Figgy blocks on the three.

479
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:45,667
Chris has number five.

480
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:47,975
Gen Y are losing ground.

481
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,600
Chris rushes, he is at six.

482
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,470
More than one for Chris.

483
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:00,507
Come down! Chris has all ten!

484
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,779
You have to bring them to the table 
before you come back.

485
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,554
Top right!

486
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:07,989
Go away!

487
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:10,392
Figgy has all ten!

488
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:15,797
This is Ken, for Gen X.

489
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:19,426
Figgy leaves. 
Ken is in the chair.

490
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:23,705
Ken is aiming for the numbers 11 to 20.

491
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:27,008
This is Michelle.

492
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:30,441
Ken ale 14.

493
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:32,881
Michelle tries to catch up to him.

494
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:34,716
Ken ale 15.

495
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,900
Gen Y are fighting 
to stay in the game.

496
00:24:39,753 --> 00:24:42,423
Ken struggles 
to catch number 20.

497
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,627
The tribe gives everything it has. 
He has it!

498
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:49,490
So far, the Gen X strategy 
is working well.

499
00:24:52,662 --> 00:24:54,002
Michelle is 18.

500
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:56,371
Meet David for Gen X

501
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:57,873
and Michelle ale 20.

502
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,442
Gen Y 
are in on the action again.

503
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:05,772
Like in football, in high school!

504
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,141
David is in the chair.

505
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:09,609
We back to the end!

506
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:11,836
This is Michaela.

507
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:13,813
She was unstoppable

508
00:25:14,118 --> 00:25:15,648
in the reward test.

509
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:18,978
David but 24.

510
00:25:21,074 --> 00:25:25,039
Michaela must take 
numbers 21 through 30, in order.

511
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,960
Can she catch David?

512
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:28,728
David but 26.

513
00:25:30,188 --> 00:25:32,140
27, and the 28, right there!

514
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:33,675
David is at 28.

515
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,511
Michaela quickly arrives at 24.

516
00:25:38,726 --> 00:25:40,151
David but 29.

517
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:42,684
More than a room for David.

518
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:49,991
- And he has it! David comes back down. 
- To your left!

519
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:51,584
You go-y, Dave, you go-y!

520
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:53,328
Michaela is at 29.

521
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:56,590
And David... They have all 30!

522
00:25:56,715 --> 00:25:58,066
Forward, Gen X!

523
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:01,719
Michaela at 30.

524
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:03,338
Take it down!

525
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:06,799
Another hotly contested event!

526
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:11,413
Now you have to 
reconstruct a sentence.

527
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:12,839
You have 30 letters.

528
00:26:12,964 --> 00:26:15,568
You have to guess the sentence

529
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:17,852
to continue surviving 
in this game.

530
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,921
This is where communication

531
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:21,389
is crucial.

532
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,199
Gen Ys count the letters. 
Will it work?

533
00:26:25,324 --> 00:26:28,621
No need to place the letters 
if you know it won't work.

534
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:30,990
Gen Xers 
have a different approach.

535
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:32,392
"I want to see him!"

536
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,061
Come on guys!

537
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:36,763
Shut up, shut up!

538
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:38,673
Gen Y think.

539
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:39,924
Are discussing.

540
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:42,936
It's the hare and the tortoise.

541
00:26:43,713 --> 00:26:45,713
David has another idea.

542
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,459
Is it the right one?

543
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:49,393
There's only one "G"?

544
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,454
So many words can be written 
with these letters!

545
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:55,571
What could it be?

546
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:07,027
Gen Ys spent a lot 
of time talking and thinking.

547
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,244
Gen X are experimenting.

548
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,131
Two different approaches.

549
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,547
Which will turn out

550
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,035
fruitful?

551
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,146
- That's it! That's it! 
- Gen X have another idea!

552
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:20,246
Gen Ys don't panic.

553
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:24,893
They don't even seem to realize 
they're up against another tribe.

554
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,133
They do their thing

555
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:28,990
Gen Y way.

556
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:30,684
There is no "D".

557
00:27:35,027 --> 00:27:37,791
45 Minutes 
It's been going on for quite a while.

558
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:40,502
It's a real study in contrasts.

559
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,763
- There is only one "R". 
- The Gen X proceed by attempts.

560
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:46,308
Gen Ys work from the mind,

561
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,333
but few letters move.

562
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,903
Girls! Girls!

563
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:51,580
And if ...

564
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:53,281
That's it, Dave, that's it!

565
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:55,461
It's something"...

566
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:58,616
"Someone loses"...

567
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:03,583
Gen Y are moving fast now.

568
00:28:03,877 --> 00:28:07,329
Suddenly, 
the two tribes are launched.

569
00:28:08,198 --> 00:28:10,332
You can feel the energy rising.

570
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,694
Don't stop, Dave!

571
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:18,406
Gen Y think they have it, 
all of a sudden.

572
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,532
Say it!

573
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,489
"Someone will lose their flame tonight."

574
00:28:21,614 --> 00:28:22,764
It's just!

575
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:25,810
Gen Ys win immunity!

576
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:29,464
None of them 
will lose their flame tonight.

577
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:37,492
Gen Y!

578
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:39,361
You wanted her back.

579
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:40,711
You have it.

580
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:45,390
Take your things, 
return to camp.

581
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,325
Enjoy your free evening.

582
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,004
Okay, Gen X.

583
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:50,538
Advice.

584
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,404
Someone will be 
the 4th person eliminated from this game.

585
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:56,069
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

586
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:15,689
Alright, that sucks.

587
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:17,891
We have made so much effort!

588
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:20,193
It was hard, the puzzle was hard.

589
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:21,536
What are we going to do?

590
00:29:22,472 --> 00:29:24,364
I will light the fire.

591
00:29:25,156 --> 00:29:28,702
Losing immunity today 
was tough, because on the board,

592
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:30,845
I'm not sure 
what will happen.

593
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,239
Bret and I were 
taken by surprise the day before yesterday,

594
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:35,321
so I don't feel 
safe at all.

595
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,285
But we have a plan:

596
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,732
taking Jess out by surprise.

597
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:41,307
I'm counting on Lucy 
to make it happen.

598
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,796
This puzzle was killing us.

599
00:29:48,557 --> 00:29:50,957
Yeah. 
But we did our best.

600
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:55,362
But you think 
Dave is with us?

601
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:56,973
Yes, I recruited them.

602
00:29:57,098 --> 00:29:59,107
- You are sure of it? 
- Yes it is certain.

603
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:01,376
It's Ken, Dave,

604
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,245
Bret, you and me.

605
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:07,354
I'm like a "mother tigress",

606
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:10,699
because the scenario that I love 
is me having control.

607
00:30:10,824 --> 00:30:13,325
Often I displease 
my husband and my children,

608
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,315
because I make all the decisions.

609
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,060
But somebody's got to do it, 
so if it works at home,

610
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:20,835
it should work here.

611
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:29,087
What do you have in mind?

612
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:30,492
It's very, very simple.

613
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:32,932
This morning when you and I 
were scolded and said

614
00:30:33,057 --> 00:30:35,187
not to speak to anyone, 
for me, that was settled.

615
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:43,432
It puts us, you, me and Cece back 
at the bottom of the ladder.

616
00:30:44,237 --> 00:30:46,922
What must happen, in my opinion, 
is that you, me,

617
00:30:47,354 --> 00:30:48,504
Cece and Jess,

618
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,327
It's only been four.

619
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:54,106
And Jess recruits Sunday.

620
00:30:54,231 --> 00:30:55,288
Oh my God!

621
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,165
In real life,

622
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,683
Lucy must be used to deciding.

623
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:00,894
But here,

624
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:04,562
you have to be careful 
what you say, and how.

625
00:31:04,687 --> 00:31:07,133
Because you can really upset people.

626
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:09,669
And that's exactly 
what happened, because there,

627
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:11,499
Ken wants to take her out.

628
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:15,372
And frankly, 
that sounds like a great idea to me.

629
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:17,519
We vote for Lucy, okay?

630
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:19,979
She must not have wind 
of our discussion.

631
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:22,954
On se verra là-bas, more... 
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy!

632
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:32,000
Honey... 
Lucy wants you out.

633
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:34,150
She and Chris and Bret 
don't trust you.

634
00:31:34,984 --> 00:31:36,084
No way.

635
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:38,907
Our only chance to stay,

636
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:40,861
it's for Lucy to leave.

637
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,702
What have you heard all day?

638
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:45,712
- Your name. On the block. 
- Yes, who said my name?

639
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,710
Ever since Paul left, 
Lucy has been putting everything on you.

640
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:50,945
She came to tell 
David and me

641
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,480
not to trust you. 
Your name will come out.

642
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:54,606
My name?

643
00:31:54,731 --> 00:31:56,983
Your name will come out. 
You need to talk to Sunday.

644
00:31:57,108 --> 00:31:59,594
Otherwise, you're screwed.

645
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:01,436
I am dumbfounded.

646
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:02,964
know me this

647
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,526
that it's me they want out,

648
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:07,994
because I was the mastermind 
behind Paul's elimination.

649
00:32:08,297 --> 00:32:10,130
Which surprises me greatly.

650
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,275
Because I thought 
we had the idea together.

651
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,110
So that seems a bit suspicious to me.

652
00:32:21,624 --> 00:32:23,243
I think we all vote for Cece.

653
00:32:23,368 --> 00:32:24,970
Yes, that's what I had imagined.

654
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:27,147
But Ken says

655
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:30,050
that you tell everyone 
to vote for me

656
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:34,554
and he's trying to convince me 
to vote for you.

657
00:32:37,737 --> 00:32:39,801
There, things degenerate

658
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:41,227
at high speed.

659
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:42,715
Ken told Jess!

660
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,487
Frankly, I'm shocked.

661
00:32:44,968 --> 00:32:47,534
It was the dumbest 
stunt in the world.

662
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:48,809
It's stupid.

663
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:54,170
Jessica repeated everything to Lucy.

664
00:32:55,537 --> 00:32:56,538
Why?

665
00:32:56,955 --> 00:32:58,607
That does not make any sense.

666
00:32:58,732 --> 00:32:59,733
I'm shocked.

667
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:01,990
I thought my connection with Jess

668
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,412
was genuine.

669
00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:07,153
And I just found out 
she betrayed me,

670
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,657
taking everything i told her

671
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:12,300
to serve it to Lucy 
on a silver platter.

672
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:13,827
So who are you voting for?

673
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:16,127
I do not know.

674
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,076
I don't like being told what to do, 
who I can talk to.

675
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,503
"Don't stray from the camp!"

676
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:26,595
- "Don't go and argue." Basically... 
- So that you don't reveal everything.

677
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,377
Basically, you gave me rules, 
which I, as an adult, shouldn't do.

678
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:32,921
Ken turns out to be a traitor.

679
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:35,115
My way of approaching him offended him.

680
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:38,393
I probably 
could have been nicer,

681
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,531
but Ken is emotional as a girl.

682
00:33:40,656 --> 00:33:42,577
Go on! Be serious!

683
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:44,524
We're just gonna fire Jessica.

684
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:47,172
Why worry now 
about who we eliminate?

685
00:33:47,297 --> 00:33:50,272
The important thing is: 
"At least you stay in the game.", right?

686
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:52,690
- Dave! 
- What do we do? What are you voting for?

687
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:54,968
What the hell is going on? 
Do we do it or what?

688
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:56,727
I thought it was Jessica.

689
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:59,961
At this point it's such a mess

690
00:34:00,086 --> 00:34:03,718
that the safest thing 
might be to write "Jessica".

691
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:06,911
But if I do that, 
I go back to the bottom of the ladder.

692
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:09,482
- You're not voting for me, are you? 
- But no.

693
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:11,010
My other option

694
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:13,562
is that i could play my idol 
for jessica

695
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:14,837
and save her.

696
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:17,042
But I lied to Lucy to her face.

697
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:19,359
And I think she knows it. 
I'm sure.

698
00:34:19,718 --> 00:34:21,695
Pack all your bags

699
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:24,955
because we have a cafeteria here.

700
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,499
I just want to have the idol,

701
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:29,369
just for safety. 
I don't intend to play it,

702
00:34:29,494 --> 00:34:30,495
most...

703
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,183
I have a lot to consider.

704
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:56,129
Let's talk about the last tip.

705
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:59,674
David. Did he unite this tribe

706
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:01,935
or did he rather express:

707
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,303
"The game is on."?

708
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:05,304
I don't think he united us.

709
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:07,358
It was the right move to play,

710
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:09,964
yes, the game is on.

711
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:13,084
Chris, how did you react 
back to camp after the vote?

712
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:17,260
Bret and I 
were angry with our allies.

713
00:35:17,385 --> 00:35:19,835
We were totally 
taken by surprise.

714
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:22,697
This tribe 
is in complete chaos.

715
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:25,191
We gotta raise the bar

716
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,092
or we'll be in big trouble.

717
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:31,773
If Chris and Bret really believe 
they were taken by surprise,

718
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:33,366
What does that mean

719
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:35,844
for the remaining five of the six?

720
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,713
I think we've all thought

721
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:41,580
why things 
happened this way.

722
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,585
But unfortunately,

723
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,545
we can still see the ramifications,

724
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,455
and whether it happens or not

725
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,257
let the five re-form,

726
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:50,984
I hope that is the case.

727
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:53,286
Lucy, it seems

728
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:54,921
that the last advice

729
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:57,042
was a bomb that exploded,

730
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,526
and now 
the game is on.

731
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:02,804
Yes. Everyone 
starts to feel threatened.

732
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,698
We hear 
a lot of different things,

733
00:36:04,823 --> 00:36:07,753
we mention your name, 
we mention another name...

734
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:09,078
Hence the chaos,

735
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:11,319
because no one knows 
who will vote for whom.

736
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:13,640
What do you think? 
Do you have an idea tonight?

737
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:15,408
I thought I was safe

738
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:20,014
until Jessica told me 
Ken wanted me out.

739
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:21,848
And I don't know if he could muster

740
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,992
enough people for that.

741
00:36:24,587 --> 00:36:26,848
Ken, you nod.

742
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:29,923
Yes, it refers to a discussion 
we had today.

743
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:33,198
There are different ways 
to ask for something.

744
00:36:33,323 --> 00:36:35,774
"Do you mind...?" 
"Are you okay with...?"

745
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:37,497
And then there's coming up and saying:

746
00:36:37,622 --> 00:36:39,107
"You will do this."

747
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:41,034
Yes, but that's my way of speaking.

748
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,268
I may be too direct, 
but in general, with men,

749
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:46,421
I guess 
they support straight talk.

750
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:48,675
And many tell me 
they appreciate it.

751
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:51,663
Thinking about it, instead,

752
00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:54,422
"Lucy tell me 
something that will help me

753
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,125
to move on to the next..."

754
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,085
Do you realize that you are reoffending?

755
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,662
No, no, I...

756
00:37:00,787 --> 00:37:02,856
"Let's hurry,

757
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:04,891
here is your decision, 
no explanation."

758
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:08,463
That was the whole idea, 
what I was trying to do.

759
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:10,090
Ken, the result,

760
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,899
it's that Lucy now thinks 
you want her out

761
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:15,178
and that you have 
at least discussed it with Jessica.

762
00:37:15,303 --> 00:37:18,480
What confidence do you have 
in the fact that this vote

763
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:20,774
will go as you wish?

764
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,651
I hesitated all day.

765
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:24,753
This is what happens

766
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:27,022
when someone 
I was loyal to

767
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:28,915
turns out not to be so loyal.

768
00:37:29,218 --> 00:37:31,760
Jessica, you reacted strongly.

769
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:33,078
Was he talking about you?

770
00:37:33,203 --> 00:37:35,130
Yes. I know he's talking about me.

771
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,357
But am I supposed to believe 
what you told me,

772
00:37:37,482 --> 00:37:38,483
100 %,

773
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:41,911
about what you told me others 
said about me today?

774
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,878
That's the thing, 
you never know who's telling the truth.

775
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:51,329
This is living advice!

776
00:37:51,454 --> 00:37:53,597
"Alive" in the sense of 
"not set in stone".

777
00:37:53,722 --> 00:37:56,783
Exactly. We leave the beach 
with an idea of ​​what we're going to do,

778
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,378
then she changes to the council.

779
00:37:58,658 --> 00:38:00,246
Anything can happen to the board.

780
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:02,157
It's completely unpredictable.

781
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:06,219
Jessica, 
watch your body language!

782
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:09,055
Have you 
questioned your vote tonight?

783
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,460
Chris, how about you?

784
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,063
I do not 
question my vote.

785
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,902
I may still 
take a hit,

786
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:21,901
but no 
doubts, so...

787
00:38:22,026 --> 00:38:24,913
The only question to ask 
is who is the pigeon at the table.

788
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:29,017
Everyone went all-in, 
who's the idiot who shouldn't have?

789
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:30,510
This is the real question.

790
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:32,623
The time seems right 
to find out.

791
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,899
It's time to vote.

792
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:36,274
Sunday, over to you.

793
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,810
This is for you, Paulie. 
Torpedoes launched!

794
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:14,721
I will count the votes.

795
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:26,299
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

796
00:39:26,424 --> 00:39:28,210
now is the time to do it.

797
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:38,769
Oh, damn it!

798
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:42,290
Can I say a few words, 
real quick?

799
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:43,583
Yes, stand there.

800
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:46,982
Good. I want 
you all to know:

801
00:39:47,107 --> 00:39:49,856
it was a pleasure to meet you, 
I enjoy your company.

802
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:53,326
And now for the part 
that might upset some people.

803
00:39:56,287 --> 00:39:58,407
I play this for Jessica.

804
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:00,467
Good.

805
00:40:07,602 --> 00:40:09,409
This is an immunity idol.

806
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:12,921
Votes against Jessica 
will not count.

807
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,583
I will read the votes.

808
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:22,557
Jessica. 
Does not count.

809
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,394
Jessica. 
Does not count.

810
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:31,106
Jessica. 
Does not count.

811
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,544
Jessica. 
Does not count.

812
00:40:39,597 --> 00:40:41,349
Jessica. 
Does not count.

813
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:46,521
What what. 
A Cece vote.

814
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,160
Lucy. 
A Cece vote,

815
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,462
one vote Lucy, one vote left.

816
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,147
Fourth person eliminated 
from Survivor Gen Y vs Gen X...

817
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:10,003
Bring me your torch.

818
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:16,376
Wow.

819
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,994
Lucy, the tribe has spoken.

820
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:32,198
It's time to go.

821
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:41,968
We were talking about living advice...

822
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:43,903
It doesn't get more alive than that!

823
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,181
Take your torches, 
return to camp.

824
00:41:46,306 --> 00:41:47,356
Good night.

825
00:42:03,781 --> 00:42:06,501
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

826
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:10,071
Next time in Survivor...

827
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:13,117
The Gen X idol is brought back into play.

828
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:14,476
A quest for the idol!

829
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:15,935
And a surprise mix...

830
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,278
Throw away your bandanas!

831
00:42:19,297 --> 00:42:21,381
...threatens to separate two lovers.

832
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:22,942
I really love Taylor.

833
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:25,487
My biggest fear 
is that we will be separated.

834
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:27,689
You have no idea 
what will happen.

835
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:30,339
I was almost in control

836
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,303
and it almost worked.

837
00:42:32,428 --> 00:42:35,335
I didn't expect 
Dave to play the idol,

838
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,038
I was rather shocked.

839
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:38,484
I went all out,

840
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:41,231
I probably should have 
gone more slowly.

841
00:42:41,356 --> 00:42:43,456
This is one of the lessons 
I learned.

842
00:42:43,581 --> 00:42:45,456
But unfortunately,

843
00:42:45,581 --> 00:42:47,203
a little too late.
