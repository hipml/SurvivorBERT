1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:03,920
>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,090
Three days before the merge,
Kucha had a one-member advantage

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,635
over Ogakor.
>> NICK: It's a huge advantage,

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,846
because the pressure is on them
to win the next challenge.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,264
>> JEFF: And it looked like they
might regain their winning

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,768
streak when Nick led them to
victory in the reward challenge.

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,438
>> NICK: We are a very cocky
group.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:25,942
It's fun to have them talk about
how hungry they are, and us

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,402
going there and win all their
food.

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,071
>> JEFF: Ogakor couldn't hide
their frustration.

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,823
>> JERRI: The other tribe will
probably just pick us off one by

12
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,243
one.
>> JEFF: But before the immunity

13
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:39,456
challenge could take place, the
game took a violent twist,

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,167
Michael passed out in the fire,
and was severely burned.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,003
>> (<i> Michael groaning</i> )
>> MICHAEL: Kucha, you guys

16
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,422
know what to do.
>> JERRI: There has been an

17
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,339
accident at the Kucha camp, and
one of their members has been

18
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:52,135
evacuated.
>> JEFF: Michael's evacuation

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,263
leaves Kucha and Ogakor even,
with five members each.

20
00:00:55,346 --> 00:01:00,310
Tonight, will new strategies and
new friendships be born as the

21
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,938
two tribes merge into one?
Who will be the first person

22
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:13,990
voted out of the new tribe?
>> They've been handed a gift.

23
00:01:14,073 --> 00:02:21,057
voted out of the new tribe?
>> They've been handed a gift.

24
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,061
They are going into this with an
advantage, because we were

25
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,437
supposed to be one up on them
anyway.

26
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,065
They were about to be voted off
one by one, and they know it.

27
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,401
>> JEFF V.: For the last three
weeks, we've been competing with

28
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,320
another tribe.
At this point we get down to ten

29
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,072
total people, and we come
together and merge into one

30
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,366
tribe.
>> KIMMI: It blows my mind to

31
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,702
even picture any sort of loyalty
toward...

32
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,578
I don't even know them.
We have been through so much

33
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,373
together.
>> JEFF V.: We've talked about

34
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,042
strategy and how we were going
to merge with this other team

35
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,712
ever since Mike got hurt,
because the last thing that he

36
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,256
said to us as he left was that
somebody from Kucha needs to

37
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,467
take this money.
And regardless of what happens,

38
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,095
we need to eat 'em up and spit
'em out.

39
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,264
>> ALICIA: This is going to have
to get ugly if we really want

40
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,391
this thing to work.
>> The first vote, we have to do

41
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,602
something to get an advantage.
>> NICK: It's going to depend on

42
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,729
that first vote, and it's smooth
sailing from there.

43
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,607
>> You hit it on the head, son.
>> ELISABETH: If I had to vote

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,568
right now, I'd vote Colby, and
I'd vote Jerri next.

45
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,737
>> ALICIA: It's got to be Jerri
and Colby first.

46
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,239
>> JEFF V.: My instinct says
Tina was the guiding force.

47
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,490
When I was standing in that
number one circle and I was

48
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,952
quizzing her, and the way she
was answering my questions just

49
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,247
told me that she was putting on
a face, and was a shrewd woman.

50
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,167
>> JEFF V.: We were just trying
to figure out who probably is

51
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,961
Ogakor's weak link, and maybe we
can convince them to come over

52
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,338
and vote on our side.
>> ALICIA: Tina will not turn on

53
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,633
her team.
>> JEFF V.: No, I know Tina

54
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,093
won't turn.
>> ALICIA: There's no way.

55
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,470
>> Most likely to turn is Keith.
>> Keith and Amber.

56
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,098
>> ALICIA: I just think Nick and
I are going to have to be ready

57
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,475
for anything 'cause he and I are
going to be the first ones.

58
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,310
>> KIMMI: See, I think they'll
be gunnin' for me.

59
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,186
>> JEFF V.: Listen to you all
talking.

60
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,022
It's me.
Plus, Kimmi on the first reward

61
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:55,109
challenge.
They asked who Debb voted for,

62
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,778
and Kimmi said Jeff, so they
know that I have a vote against

63
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,115
me.
We're anticipating a five to

64
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,369
five tie in the first vote.
And in the rules, when there's a

65
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,538
deadlock tie, the person with
the most votes accumulated to

66
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,499
that point is the one to leave.
>> NICK: I had totally forgotten

67
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,001
about that.
>> JEFF V.: It's never left my

68
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,169
mind.
>> RODGER: If they remember

69
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,338
that...
>> JEFF V.: But then again,

70
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,340
that's a vote against me, so it
wouldn't leave my mind.

71
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,426
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> ELISABETH: What happens then?

72
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,514
>> I would be, like, forget
about it.

73
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,195
>> COLBY: Yesterday everything
was canceled because of the

74
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:42,365
accident with Kucha.
You know, you're just left with

75
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,701
days that seem like there's at
least 19 to 20 hours of

76
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,495
daylight.
We have no idea what's going

77
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:51,290
on, and we have no idea how
drastic or serious the situation

78
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,376
is with Kucha.
>> TINA: It's so unfortunate.

79
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,838
>> COLBY: Automatically, we
assume the worst... horrible.

80
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,258
The worst part about this is
waiting around for information.

81
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,760
>> TINA: It's like getting a
phone call from the hospital,

82
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,804
saying, "Oh, we've got him here,
but can't tell you what's

83
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,723
wrong."
>> JERRI: You don't think Rodger

84
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,892
had a stroke or anything?
(<i> Tina gasps dramatically</i> )

85
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,522
>> TINA: Oh, my gosh.
>> COLBY: We don't know

86
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,066
anything.
We don't know when we're

87
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,569
merging, we don't know the
condition of Kucha's member

88
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,447
who's been in an accident.
We don't know very much at all.

89
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,622
>> AMBER: "Boys night out."
>> COLBY: Well?

90
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,209
>> AMBER: It's different.
>> AMBER: "You've wondered for

91
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,087
weeks 'What's their camp like?'
So, here's your big chance.

92
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,049
Send your scouts for the hike.
The men will visit while the

93
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,425
women remain.
Cook a big dinner,

94
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,802
there'll be guests to
entertain."

95
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,554
So, we'll stay here and the guys
are going to come to our camp,

96
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,806
we'll cook dinner for them,
they're going to cook for you

97
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,433
guys.
>> COLBY: Cool.

98
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,936
So, we get to go on a hike.
>> KEITH: I'm all over that.

99
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,521
>> COLBY: Yeah!
Finally get out and do

100
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,482
something.
I better iron a shirt!

101
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,610
(<i> laughing</i> )
Big night out on the town,

102
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,362
brother.
>> KEITH: Big night, you know?

103
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,782
(<i> indistinct conversations</i> )
Life is good.

104
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,744
>> COLBY: Life is good.
>> KEITH: The merge is when the

105
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,580
two teams come together to make
one team, and the game becomes

106
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:16,167
one against one instead of team
against team.

107
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:16,793
>> COLBY: Tina, you going to
catch the kids some fish

108
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,171
tonight?
>> TINA: I hope.

109
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,091
You go to one camp or the other,
and I'm not sure how that

110
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,302
decision is going to be made at
this point.

111
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,179
>> KEITH: We'll get a real great
take on the guys in their tribe,

112
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,974
and where things lie.
>> TINA: It's important for us

113
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,686
to get information right now
about who's had votes cast

114
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,522
against them, because it's
probably going to come down to a

115
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,150
tie-breaker vote.
>> COLBY: We've got to be

116
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,569
totally silent on who's had any
votes.

117
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,946
>> JERRI: Yes, we do have a lot
at stake.

118
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,739
If we slip anything out
regarding the voting situation,

119
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,077
we're done.
The only thing to break the tie

120
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,580
is past votes for the person who
is voted for.

121
00:06:54,664 --> 00:07:00,002
If they were to vote for myself
or Keith... we'd be out.

122
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,353
>> ELISABETH: Hey, fellas, are
you guys ready to hear this?

123
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:21,149
We got mail.
"Girls' night out.

124
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,651
You've wondered for weeks
'What's their camp like?'

125
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,696
So here's your big chance.
Send your scouts for the hike.

126
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,741
The women will go visit, while
the fellows remain.

127
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,536
Cook a big dinner, there'll be
guests to entertain."

128
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,038
>> JEFF V.: So, you guys are
going over there, and those

129
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,540
girls are coming over here.
They're keeping the chicks

130
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,251
apart.
>> ELISABETH: They're going to

131
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,879
send their chicks here?
>> ALICIA: Oh, that's sneaky.

132
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,046
>> ELISABETH: That is very
sneaky.

133
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,382
>> ALICIA: That is very sneaky.
This is how it's going to

134
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,718
start-- separate the boys and
the girls.

135
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,888
>> JEFF V.: We knew that the
merger was going to start today.

136
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,890
We just weren't sure exactly
how.

137
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,226
So, we got this note, and our
girls are going to them, and

138
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,021
their chicks are coming to us,
and we're entertaining them and

139
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,732
swooning them and somehow
convincing them that this is the

140
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,569
place to live-- Kucha beach.
>> ALICIA: We know we don't want

141
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,238
to go over there, so they better
really pull out all the stops.

142
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,365
>> NICK: I think we have a
really nice camp, and nobody

143
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,909
really wants to move to a new
place where things are real

144
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,537
strange.
And it would kind of be our home

145
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,874
field, our home turf advantage.
>> JEFF V.: If we're responsible

146
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,168
for the dinner, then those girls
are eating much better than

147
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,921
y'all are.
>> ALICIA: Wait a minute.

148
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,091
(<i> all talking</i> )
>> ALICIA: Wait, time out.

149
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,301
>> ELISABETH: Women will go
visit.

150
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,802
>> ALICIA: Do we have the
Mountain Dew at least?

151
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
>> MEN: No!
>> ELISABETH: You have two cans

152
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,056
left?
>> ALICIA: You see how fast you

153
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,098
guys turned on us?
>> ELISABETH: We have to bring a

154
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,808
housewarming gift.
>> NICK: We're not turning on

155
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,227
you.
>> JEFF V.: Nobody's turning on

156
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,269
nobody.
>> RODGER: We need our own

157
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,938
stuff.
>> JEFF V.: We got the majority

158
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,064
of them over here.
>> NICK: There's more of them to

159
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,732
woo.
We need to woo them.

160
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,901
>> ELISABETH: Woo-woo-woo, "woo
them"?

161
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,363
>> ALICIA: You know what?
I don't like you guys anymore.

162
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,949
>> ELISABETH: This is why they
did this to us.

163
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,659
As much as it stinks that Alicia
and I aren't going to get to

164
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,913
join in our last chicken, we
know that it's for the

165
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:04,001
betterment of the whole group to
leave and go eat plain rice with

166
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:09,632
Keith and Colby.
He's supposedly a chef.

167
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,427
I don't know how much he can do
with white rice, and...

168
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,429
We're going to miss our Kucha
spices.

169
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,473
>> ALICIA: Yeah, we had a lot of
good stuff going on in our camp.

170
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,726
Those girls are going to be well
taken care of.

171
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,813
>> ELISABETH: Living large.
Whoo!

172
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,191
>> ALICIA: Elisabeth and I felt
really strange walking away from

173
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,987
camp, just us two.
It was really kind of cool,

174
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,656
and eventually it's going to
change this game.

175
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,784
It's a big open book, and we got
to write the rest of the pages

176
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:46,836
that go in it.
>> COLBY: I'm very curious as to

177
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,671
how they've been living the last
19 days.

178
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,881
With their shelter, with their
eating, you know, there's a lot

179
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:55,886
of things I want to know to see
if that's where we want to be.

180
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,347
>> ELISABETH: I'm excited.
I'm so curious to see what their

181
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,724
camp is like.
>> ALICIA: Well, that's the

182
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,312
thing...
And how they set it up for us.

183
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,943
>> TINA: Fe, fi, fo, fum!
I smell the blood of a Kucha

184
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,238
girl!
>> ALICIA: What's up?

185
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,658
>> ELISABETH: Hey!
>> ALICIA: What's up?

186
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,620
You know how funny it is--
the guys are expecting you guys

187
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,955
right now.
(<i> laughter</i> )

188
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,250
>> ALICIA: We had... laying out
the tablecloth.

189
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,753
>> It said "Boys Night Out."
>> ALICIA: They're so ready.

190
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,881
They're going to die when they
see your guys.

191
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,883
>> TINA: We've been so worried.
>> ELISABETH: They didn't even

192
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,677
tell you guys what happened?
>> TINA: No, not a word.

193
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,887
>> ALICIA: What did your note
say?

194
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,055
>> AMBER: Somebody got hurt and
they would not be returning.

195
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,931
>> TINA: And they've been
evacuated out.

196
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,350
>> ELISABETH: Sit down for this
one.

197
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,268
>> ALICIA: Yeah, this is a, it's
a big deal.

198
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,896
>> ELISABETH: It was good to
hear that they were worried and

199
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,731
hoping everything and praying
everything was okay with Mike.

200
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,735
He apparently just
hyperventilated and passed out.

201
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:57,239
And all of a sudden, I see him
down and he was face-first into

202
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:57,990
the fire.
>> ALICIA: His hands were burned

203
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,992
off.
When his hands were in the

204
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,869
water, the skin was floating up
above his hand.

205
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,162
>> ELISABETH: They were just
red.

206
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,081
>> ALICIA: They put a helicopter
right on our beach and took him

207
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,041
away.
>> TINA: Have you heard any news

208
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,125
on him at all?
>> ALICIA: Yeah, he's going to

209
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,213
be okay.
>> TINA: Glad to know it's not

210
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,798
one of those things that's life-
threatening.

211
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,258
I felt a lot of relief.
>> ALICIA: We were crying, we

212
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,552
were a mess.
It was really sad.

213
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,513
>> ELISABETH: It was very
difficult.

214
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,931
>> JERRI: When we first found
out yesterday that we were

215
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,934
merging with all five of us,
after the accident over at

216
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,814
Kucha... we didn't really know
whether to celebrate or feel

217
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:34,443
bad.
>> ALICIA: Whatever takes you

218
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,195
out of the game takes you out of
the game.

219
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,615
Whether it's a snake bite or the
fire, it was part of the game.

220
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,951
And he is the sixth person to
leave.

221
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,287
>> TINA: The importance at this
point in at five and five, had a

222
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,833
huge impact on the other four
tribes, if we had gone in at six

223
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,419
and four, we would have been
picked off one by one, no doubt

224
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,630
about it.
We're starting off the second

225
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,965
half of the game on equal
ground.

226
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,803
It's a tie ball game, we're
going into overtime.

227
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,939
>> COLBY: We got to be getting
close. Look at this.

228
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,192
Anybody home?
>> KEITH: Knock-knock.

229
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,861
<i>Hola.</i>
>> JEFF V.: What?

230
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,197
Wait a minute!
>> COLBY: What are you guys

231
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,866
doing?
Well, we took a little trip down

232
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,951
the beach.
>> KEITH: Hi, man!

233
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:29,665
>> NICK: Good to see you.
>> JEFF V.: So, your note said

234
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,876
what, "Boys Night Out"?
>> COLBY: "Boys Night Out."

235
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,211
>> JEFF V.: Ours said "Girls
Night Out."

236
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,338
>> RODGER: We were expecting the
women over here.

237
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,674
>> COLBY: Rodger, I'm real
sorry, bro.

238
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,468
I didn't even bring a skirt with
me, so I can't do anything for

239
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,846
you, man.
>> COLBY: When Keith and I

240
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,390
showed up, they couldn't have
been more disappointed.

241
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,728
They were ready to wine and dine
the women of Ogakor, and Keith

242
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,481
and I come strolling in.
Look, you guys already had the

243
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,774
table set and everything.
Y'all really were expecting

244
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,027
the...
(<i> all talking and laughing</i> )

245
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,780
>> KEITH: Colby and I were
actually kind of hoping it was

246
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,574
going to be the girls cooking
for the guys.

247
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,701
We had a good time, great
camaraderie, kind of like

248
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,203
soldiers in the field that are
putting their weapons down for

249
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,497
awhile.
>> COLBY: Well, now, you guys

250
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,373
called this Camp Carnage, but it
looks like you guys are living

251
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,876
pretty plush around here.
Our girls, when they sent us

252
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,129
off, they're like, "Man, check
out their camp-- if it's

253
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,715
smelling and there's flies, I
don't want to move over there."

254
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,009
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> JEFF V.: All I saw from Colby

255
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:26,222
were teeth-- big smile, how's it
going, whatever.

256
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,766
He just seemed very cheery and
very happy, and Keith seemed

257
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,893
like a little puppy tailing
behind him.

258
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,895
We saved a chicken for you.
>> KEITH: Are you serious?

259
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,939
>> RODGER: Yeah, we're going to
have chicken tonight.

260
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,692
>> KEITH: You guys are too much.
>> JEFF V.: We got spices, too.

261
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,694
>> KEITH: We can roast it in
paper bark.

262
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,779
Wrap that whole thing in there,
put the spices on and slow roast

263
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,114
that.
They saved a chicken for us.

264
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,034
They killed their last chicken
and cooked it, which just was a

265
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,037
real gentleman thing to do for
us.

266
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,748
>> JEFF V.: You know, there's a
<i>Survivor</i> twist to everything,

267
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,000
and they got us again.
I was expecting women, you know.

268
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,587
We were going to lather them up
and go pick them flowers, and

269
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,757
now we're going to have to shift
gears.

270
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,926
(<i> laughing</i> )
They're nice, you know?

271
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,178
They're nice guys.
I knew they would be, but I get

272
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,098
the feeling that Keith is an
outsider.

273
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,224
So far, they're exactly what I
expected.

274
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,603
They seem to have a good
relationship together, which I

275
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,023
didn't expect.
I figured that Keith would sort

276
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,569
of be off on his own, and he
could be, you know?

277
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,946
They may be working us here.
Just pick one up, take a bite,

278
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,949
pass it.
>> COLBY: I didn't think I'd see

279
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,119
chicken across these lips for 24
days.

280
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,956
That lemon pepper is the bomb.
>> JEFF V.: It was good chicken,

281
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,583
and it was good to be able to
provide them with chicken,

282
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,501
'cause they obviously had not
been eating.

283
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,295
>> KEITH: Colby, what do you
want me to do with this bone,

284
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,380
man?
I don't like the way we're

285
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,131
passing.
Can we change the passing

286
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,134
around?
Can we go the other way?

287
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,638
That was a huge thing for us.
We really enjoyed that a lot.

288
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,641
I think as the days go on, this
game is going to be difficult.

289
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,643
It is for me personally, 'cause
I get caught up in the

290
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,229
friendship thing quite easily.
>> RODGER: Even though it was

291
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,439
little tough, that was still a
good chicken.

292
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,982
>> KEITH: Yeah.
>> COLBY: It was an excellent

293
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,319
chicken.
>> RODGER: I know everybody is

294
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,987
nicey-nicey now, but I imagine
that'll change.

295
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,364
I think it will be even more
interesting once all ten of us,

296
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,616
the women and everybody is in
the hut.

297
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,951
There'll be some times I'm sure
when things won't be so nice

298
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:21,837
around here.
>> ELISABETH: You need some

299
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,881
help?
>> JERRI: I think I'll be all

300
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,549
right.
I'm just trying to cover this,

301
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,760
'cause you know what I just
realized?

302
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,011
Our only matches are in Keith's
pocket.

303
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,097
>> ALICIA: Uh-oh.
>> JERRI: Yeah, "uh-oh" is

304
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,850
right.
So, I'm thinking we should

305
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:38,520
probably cook everything because
Keith has the matches.

306
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,521
>> ALICIA: Are you sure he has
them?

307
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,316
>> JERRI: I know he does.
>> ALICIA: He's probably

308
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,484
laughing right now, going "Guess
what?

309
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,361
It's raining and I got the
matches."

310
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,529
>> JERRI: He doesn't realize it,
I'm sure.

311
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:52,826
I don't want to talk about Keith
in front of our guests.

312
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,203
>> ALICIA: Smell that.
>> JERRI: If I voice my opinions

313
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,206
about how I really feel about
him, they are going to figure

314
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,834
out that votes have been placed
against him.

315
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,587
He should not be in charge of
the matches.

316
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:08,217
Could have potentially now been
an issue where we couldn't eat.

317
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,886
>> TINA: I don't think it was a
deliberate thing where he said,

318
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,012
"I'm going to take my matches
with me so the girls won't have

319
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,223
it."
He would not do that under any

320
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,184
circumstances.
It's in Jerri's best interest to

321
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:24,400

Jerri's a good chick.

325
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:36,245
going to make my famous
tortilla, and we opened a can of

326
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,956
whole peeled tomatoes.
>> ALICIA: We just want to tell

getting chicken right now.

00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,084

There's no way they saved any

329

330
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,797

>> ALICIA: That's okay.

332
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,592
>> AMBER: This is definitely
difficult for us.

333
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,262
I mean, we wish we had so much
more to offer them.

334
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,888
It's upsetting that we can't
give them as much as they can

335
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,932
give us.
>> ALICIA: Wow, that looks

336
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,976
amazing, though.
>> JERRI: Give me, like, some

337
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,437
ingredients that I can get
creative with.

338
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,272
>> ALICIA: When you don't have a
lot of food and you open up a

00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,231

time.

340
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,734
So, we're really honored that
they did that.

>> ALICIA: I feel like I can't

342
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,614
wait to get them back to our
camp to give them something to

343
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,783
eat, you know?
And I never thought that I would

344
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,702
feel that way.
I really thought I would be

345
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,205
thinking I'm not sharing
anything with them.

346
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,503
I don't eat meat, I don't eat
pork, and I'm, like, craving a

347
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,255
hot dog and a hamburger; I could
care less right now.

348

dog.

food 19 of those 20.

351
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,306
So, what's your favorite kind of
food?

352
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,641
>> JERRI: Hot fudge.
>> TINA: How about Dove

We are absolutely torturing
ourselves.

00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,609
>> ALICIA: Have you ever had
different flavor Tootsie Rolls,

357
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,319
like cherry Tootsie Rolls?
>> TINA: Yes.

358
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:54,198
>> JERRI: Vanilla?
>> ALICIA: They are yummy.

359
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,326
>> JERRI: When did they come out
with vanilla Tootsie Rolls?

360
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,376
>> AMBER: I asked Alicia about
their firewood situation.

361
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,713
She said they have so, so much,
they don't worry about the

362
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,965
firewood at all.
>> JERRI: They have a kitchen,

363
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,300
they have all these wonderful
things.

364
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,679
We have nothing.
>> AMBER: I agree.

I'm totally for going.
>> JERRI: I'm so stoked about

it?

Yep, I think that's what it is.

00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,721
thoughts.
>> RODGER: That-That was one of

472
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,181
my thoughts, too.
>> TINA: But we're on this high

473
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,391
thing.
>> NICK: Yeah.

474
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,017
>> TINA: And if it runs down,
it'll run down over there, won't

475
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,394
it?
>> RODGER: It's called a dry

476
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,645
creek bed.
I don't know if it's always dry

477
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,313
or not.
That's the question.

478
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,565
My idea was to originally build
the, uh, hut up in the trees

479
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,526
where you got some good anchors,
and then the girls said, they

480
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,195
would like to stay down on the
sand 'cause it sleeps better.

481
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,530
>> Is that...?
>> RODGER: Go down with it a

482
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:14,870
little bit.
>> RODGER: Okay, go.

483
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,496
>> ALICIA: Hey, Jer?
>> JERRI: Yeah.

484
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,290
>> ALICIA: What was that little
big fish-- what was that?

485
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:18,999
>> JERRI: All right, you know
what?

486
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,709
>> ELISABETH: Oh.
>> Oh, yeah.

487
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,169
>> ALICIA: That would be a
perfect name.

488
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,128
>> ELISABETH: What is that?
>> RODGER: Barramundi.

489
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,088
>> ALICIA: Barramundi?
>> JEFF V.: Barramundi.

490
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,631
>> Ooh, I like that fish.
>> ALICIA: You...

491
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,425
That means, like, if you catch
this fish, we'll be eating for

492
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,718
days.
>> JERRI: We are called the

493
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,888
Barramundi tribe.
It's a great name for our new

494
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,681
tribe, 'cause this is when
things get slippery and

495
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:38,768
sneaky, and it's hard to catch
people.

496
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,769
>> ELISABETH: It's the catch of
the day.

497
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,689
We're quite a catch.
>> KEITH: Good old honeymoon

498
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,525
stage is going to end quickly.
We're going to have to go into

499
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,236
an immunity challenge, and it's
going to be obvious that we're

500
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,823
kind of two teams living as one
tribe.

501
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:02,292
>> JEFF: Welcome!
I will take the immunity idol.

502
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,629
Barramundi, new tribe name.
New tribe, new game.

503
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,757
No longer playing for tribal
immunity, playing for individual

504
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,594
immunity.
(<i> all responding</i> )

505
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,555
>> JEFF: This is what you covet.
Wear this, you're immune from

506
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,806
Tribal Council.
You cannot be voted out.

507
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,808
Today's challenge is called "The
Perch."

508
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,646
There are ten wooden pillars to
stand on, one for each of you.

509
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm going to warn you-- this
could be a long one.

510
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:29,736
This challenge tests both your
will and endurance.

511
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:34,407
Last one standing wins this, is
immune from the vote tonight.

512
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,332
Keep your eye on the talisman!
Immunity at stake.

513
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:56,137
Survivors ready... go!
>> JERRI: Anybody want to look

514
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,973
up at the sky and see if the sun
might peek out?

515
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:58,974
>> RODGER: I'm-I'm afraid to
look.

516
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,142
>> ELISABETH: Rodger's, like,
"I'm not looking."

517
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,186
>> RODGER: I am fixed on the
woods up there, son.

518
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,563
I don't look down at the water.
(<i> laughter</i> )

519
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:16,658
If I did, I'd be a goner.
>> JEFF V.: I'm going to try to

520
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,035
alphabetize the 50 states.
>> RODGER: Well, that...

521
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,204
>> AMBER: Isn't there a song?
>> RODGER: Arkansas.

522
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,415
>> JERRI: Alabama.
>> ELISABETH: Boy, things sure

523
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,792
have gotten fun out here.
(<i> laughter</i> )

524
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,835
>> NICK: You guys, have a good
game.

525
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,338
>> All right.
>> ALICIA: Bye, baby.

526
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,841
>> Bye.
>> Bye, Nick.

527
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,343
>> RODGER: Just don't get too
close to me, Nick, 'cause I'm

528
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,804
liable to be next.
>> NICK: I've been sick the last

529
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,681
couple days, and I got up there,
felt a little dizzy, knew I

530
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,685
wasn't going to win, and jumped
off, and got a good hour of rest

531
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,229
so, that made much more sense to
me than standing up on that

532
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,356
block and getting tired.
>> COLBY: I'll jump in right

533
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,190
now...
Like, if it makes you feel

534
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,651
better.
>> AMBER: Colby, you're jumping?

535
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,403
>> COLBY: Yeah.
>> Check on Nick for us.

536
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,738
>> AMBER: Oh, what a splash!
(<i> applause</i> )

537
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,825
>> And it...
>> I like the flip.

538
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,538
>> NICK: This game's gonna go
forever.

539
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,540
>> COLBY: It is gonna go
forever.

540
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:10,879
My strategy was to make the-the
Kucha guys mad, to convince them

541
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,716
that I'm the man to vote for.
If I can draw some attention

542
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,054
away from Keith and Jerri, who
both have several votes for

543
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,930
them, we really need one of
those guys to win immunity and

544
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,768
the other to be camouflaged.
Because if Kucha members vote

545
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,354
for either Jerri or Keith, we're
going down.

546
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,772
It's not even bothering some of
those guys out there.

547
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,857
It's killing me.
>> NICK: Yeah.

548
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,402
>> JEFF V.: I feel so good!
>> AMBER: Uh-oh.

549
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,239
Jeff's bringing something out,
guys.

550
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,115
>> ELISABETH: Is that an ice
cream cone on there?

551
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,242
>> JEFF V.: No, no, that's
peanut butter.

552
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,577
>> ELISABETH: It's not peanut
butter now.

553
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,370
Both you guys, shut up.
>> JEFF V.: That's peanut

554
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,080
butter.
>> ELISABETH: That's not.

555
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,123
Is it Skippy?
>> JEFF: Hey, guys.

556
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,875
I have a little peanut butter,
chocolate...

557
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,252
>> ELISABETH: Oh!
Chocolate.

558
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,962
>> JEFF V.: The first person off
gets it?

559
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,631
>> So what are you saying
exactly?

560
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,467
>> JEFF V.: Who gets it?
>> ELISABETH: Colby!

561
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,802
>> JEFF: That's a great idea.
Colby?

562
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,429
>> COLBY: Yeah.
>> JEFF: Nick, come here.

563
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,558
>> ALL (<i> screaming</i> ): No!
>> That's not right.

564
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,936
>> ELISABETH: This is why you
keep your mouth shut.

565
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,979
My mom says "Elisabeth, keep
your mouth shut!"

566
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,981
Do I listen?
No!

567
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,858
>> JEFF: He's getting a big old
dip, Elisabeth.

568
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,819
That's pure peanut butter right
there.

569
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:20,782
Anybody decides to bail, you can
join me.

570
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,993
>> JERRI: This is torture!
>> RODGER: I was just waiting

571
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,622
for you to say those words.
>> You can get a big scoop.

572
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,416
>> JEFF V.: That's not enough.
>> JERRI: No, that's not enough,

573
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,750
Jeff.
>> JEFF V.: That's not enough,

574
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,584
Jeff.
Forget it.

575
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,004
>> JEFF: Okay.
It's plenty for Rodger.

576
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,007
>> RODGER: It ain't very good.
Stick it out.

577
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,968
>> COLBY: That one bite of
peanut butter was better than

578
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,970
any of the wine and cheese and
crackers...

579
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,806
>> JEFF V.: Damn it! Shut up.
>> COLBY: Come on over to the

580
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,057
dark side, Jeff.
>> AMBER: If you don't think you

581
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,017
can outstand us, then I would
go, 'cause you're not gonna get

582
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,645
that later.
>> JEFF V.: Not if y'all are

583
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,522
gonna vote me off, though.
>> He's gonna be up there...

584
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,523
>> COLBY: Now, see, you hear
that, Jeff?

585
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,483
>> JEFF V.: What?
>> COLBY: Look at these women.

586
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,986
They're bound and determined to
win this.

587
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:05,660
>> Oh!
>> Oh!

588
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,328
>> God.
>> Oh, my God.

589
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,997
>> COLBY: Oh, my God.
>> JERRI: Oh, my God.

590
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,584
>> JEFF V.: Elisabeth...
>> ELISABETH: Is it good?

591
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,337
>> JEFF: No more takers?
Okay.

592
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:21,259
Four hours.
See you guys in another couple.

593
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,352
>> TINA: What you got there,
buddy?

594
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:35,523
>> JEFF: Here's the offer.
An ice cream.

595
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:45,867
I got a really hot chocolate.
>> AMBER: I just couldn't stand

596
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:54,918
there.
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

597
00:29:55,001 --> 00:30:14,395
there.
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

598
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,897
>> JEFF V.: Maybe they feel
vulnerable.

599
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,066
Maybe those are the four people
that feel the most vulnerable.

600
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,276
I felt vulnerable, but, you
know, I couldn't do it.

601
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,865
I knew I couldn't do it.
>> RODGER: Tina out there-- she

602
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,116
has not had anything to eat all
day long.

603
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,537
She-She didn't eat any breakfast
this morning, and the rest of us

604
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,289
all had about a little bit over
a half a cup of rice.

605
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,125
And I know they're getting cold,
too.

606
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,127
>> COLBY: These four are pretty
damn determined.

607
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,921
I've never seen anything like
it.

608
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,548
I had no idea it would last this
long.

609
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,424
There's no telling how long
those four are gonna stay out

610
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,969
there.
Another fun day for Club

611
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:53,059
Barramundi.
>> JEFF: I'll tell you, this

612
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,562
fire feels good right here.
Unfortunately, not enough to

613
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,438
heat you up.
>> ALICIA: Yeah, we know.

614
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,941
>> ELISABETH: Is there any
more negotiating?

615
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:13,121
>> JEFF: Maybe.
What makes you want to negotiate

616
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,124
now, but you didn't earlier?
>> ELISABETH: A boat ride

617
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:30,179
back... could be worth it.
>> How long you think they're

618
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,849
going to stay out there?
>> JEFF V.: I heard Tina say

619
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,726
"Nothing is bringing me down at
this point."

620
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:44,027
I bet Elisabeth goes next.
>> JEFF: Stay dry, I'll get you

621
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,029
in.
>> ELISABETH: It's past my

622
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,656
bedtime.
>> RODGER: Getting off,

623
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,326
Elisabeth!
(<i> cheers</i> )

624
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,036
>> ELISABETH: Good job, you
guys.

625
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:59,167
Go get 'em.
>> RODGER: You okay?

626
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,503
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God,
it feels so good.

627
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,214
>> RODGER: We're all real proud
of you.

628
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,975
>> JEFF V.: I think they've been
out there over ten hours now.

629
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,145
I know that Alicia is concerned
she's being voted for tonight,

630
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:26,027
so I think she's going to stay.
These people are crazy.

631
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,698
You guys know we got to go to
Tribal Council tonight?

632
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,203
>> Hey, Jeff.
>> JEFF: Your faces say a lot.

633
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:40,541
Here's what I have.
Hot coffee, or hot chocolate.

634
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:47,048
>> ALICIA: And a boat ride in.
>> JEFF: And a boat ride in.

635
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,176
>> ALICIA: I'll take it.
I'm done.

636
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,220
>> JEFF: All righty.
>> KEITH: Hey, Tina?

637
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,056
>> TINA: What?
>> KEITH: I need this one.

638
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,476
>> TINA: I looked over at Keith
and Keith said "Tina, I need

639
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,187
this one."
In his heart he must have really

640
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:05,066
thought that he was going to get
the votes cast against him.

641
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,401
>> ALICIA: I'm good.
I want coffee!

642
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,113
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )
>> ALICIA: Are you coming with

643
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,906
me?
>> TINA: I am.

644
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,742
>> ALICIA: Oh, Tina is getting
down.

645
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,287
>> TINA: It's the hardest thing
I've ever done to come in.

646
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,289
Much harder to come in than stay
out there, because I've been out

647
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:25,086
there ten hours.
I knew for our team that I

648
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,922
needed to make that decision.
So I stepped down and let him

649
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:31,801
have it.
>> KEITH: Yes!

650
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:36,389
>> Good work, Keith.
>> JEFF: Wear that.

651
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,128
>> JEFF: What a day!
>> ALICIA: What a day.

652
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,923
>> JEFF: You guys just finished
a marathon immunity challenge.

653
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,300
Come to Tribal Council, where
unfortunately, you're going to

654
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,344
vote the first person out of
your new tribe.

655
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,138
Let's talk about today's
challenge.

656
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,350
Nick lasted 90 minutes.
Now, at the other end of the

657
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:26,314
spectrum, Keith lasted ten
hours, 18 minutes.

658
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:31,486
You get immunity.
Tina, Alicia lasted 10 hours, 17

659
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,281
minutes, 55 seconds.
Alicia, I'm thinking you

660
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,701
obviously must not be worried,
because you were out there for a

661
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,828
long time and finally said
"Okay, I guess I've proved my

662
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,873
point."
>> ALICIA: This challenge felt

663
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,501
like it was going to go on
forever.

664
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,963
And I don't think that my
stepping off is going to change

665
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,175
what was going to happen tonight
anyways.

666
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,052
>> JEFF: Keith, when I came up
to you and handed you the

667
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,388
talisman, I said
"congratulations," and you

668
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,350
said "Tina gave that to me."
>> KEITH: I really firmly

669
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:08,481
believe that if she did not say,
"Okay, I'm done now," we'd all

670
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:13,694
still be there, we really would.
She's become like my sister, I'm

671
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,365
telling you, and it was
definitely a gift.

672
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:21,244
>> JEFF: What was it, Tina, that
finally made you say, okay?

673
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,163
>> TINA: At this point, I'm
still a team player.

674
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,582
Our team advancing does mean a
lot.

675
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:32,380
I know Keith needed this.
So... it's all right.

676
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,215
>> JEFF: Rodger, when you look
at what happened today and how

677
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,886
many people took a bribe sooner
or later and jumped off, do

678
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,556
you think everybody here is
really worried?

679
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,391
>> RODGER: Well, everybody but
Keith I would say, Keith is

680
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,061
definitely not worried, but yes
I think anyone of the other nine

681
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:51,399
of us are, has a very good
possibility of being voted off.

682
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,735
>> JEFF: Here's the deal.
Survive tonight's vote, you

683
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,405
are here till the bitter end.
You'll be part of the jury at

684
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,199
the very least, you may be the
final two.

685
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,369
If you're voted out tonight,
game is over.

686
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,081
You go home, and that's it.
Let's vote.

687
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:17,174
Nick, you're up.
>> COLBY: It was a strategic

688
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:31,439
Nick, you're up.
>> COLBY: It was a strategic

689
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:38,154
move that was determined the
first week we were here.

690
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,505
>> RODGER: I really like the
guy, but he's from the Ogakor

691
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,676
tribe and they have all got to
go.

692
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,314
>> TINA: He seemed like a really
great guy, this is 100% a

693
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:19,487
strategic vote.
>> JEFF V.: 'Cause everything

694
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:26,410
is bigger and better in Texas...
this lone star has got to go.

695
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,220
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

696
00:37:55,773 --> 00:38:00,194
>> JEFF: Once the votes are
tallied, the decision is final.

697
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:01,654
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area

698
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:11,038
immediately.
First vote, Colby.

699
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:20,089
Colby.
Jeff.

700
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:26,512
Jeff.
Two votes each Jeff and Colby.

701
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:34,562
Jeff.
Colby.

702
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:41,902
Jeff.
Colby.

703
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:48,743
I'll read the last two.
One for Jeff, that's five.

704
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:54,457
Look at that, one for Colby.
We have a tie.

705
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,210
Okay.
In the case of a tie, here's how

706
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,089
it works.
Jeff, Colby, you will not vote.

707
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,383
The other eight of you will
vote.

708
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,720
And as is customary, I'm going
to give you guys a chance to

709
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,431
plead your case, although I
don't know who you're pleading

710
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,225
to, this is obviously two tribes
voting completely down tribal

711
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,936
lines.
Jeff, we'll start with you.

712
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,646
>> JEFF V.: There's nothing that
I can say, I don't think, to

713
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,400
change anybody's mind.
If I go home tonight I will walk

714
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,652
out of here with a smile on my
face, and be very proud of every

715
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,615
moment that I had here.
>> JEFF: Colby?

716
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,492
>> COLBY: I only know how to
play the game one way and that's

717
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,661
full tilt, and if that makes me
a threat then so be it.

718
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:37,291
But I'm here for one reason and
that's to win, and this is the

719
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,752
only way I know how.
>> JEFF: What we're going to do

720
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,587
is, we're going to vote again.
Nick, you're up first, if you

721
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,300
would, please.
Thanks.

722
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,161
>> JEFF: Same rules apply, as
with any vote once they're

723
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:22,503
tallied the decision is final.
Jeff.

724
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:30,845
Colby.
Jeff.

725
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:37,685
Colby.
Jeff.

726
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:47,194
Colby.
Jeff.

727
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:56,036
Colby.
So it's very clear, old tribal

728
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,956
lines run very deep in this
group.

729
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,208
I think we could be here until
the sun comes up and nobody here

730
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,336
is going to change their vote.
So we're ruling this a

731
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,381
deadlocked vote.
Now what happens, the rules

732
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:11,719
state we go to votes cast in
previous Tribal Councils.

733
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,347
Whoever has more votes, Jeff or
Colby, will be voted out.

734
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,558
Colby, how many votes have you
had cast against you?

735
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,603
>> Zero.
>> JEFF: Zero. Jeff?

736
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:24,523
>> JEFF V.: One that I know of.
>> JEFF: Enough.

737
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:33,574
You need to bring me your torch.
>> JEFF: Jeff, the tribe has

738
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:44,752
You need to bring me your torch.
>> JEFF: Jeff, the tribe has

739
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:57,765
spoken.
It's time for you to go.

740
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,727
I could be wrong, but I have a
feeling over the next few days

741
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:06,106
new friendships are going to
emerge, new voting patterns will

742
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,569
form.
You guys have had a long day.

743
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,571
You can grab your torches and
head back to camp.

744
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:21,622
I'll see you tomorrow.
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes

745
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:34,301
I'll see you tomorrow.
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes

746
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:39,932
from our next episode and hear
what Jeff has to say.

747
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,644
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>
Will tribal loyalties begin to

748
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,647
crumble when Elisabeth
discovers a crack in Ogakor's

749
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,441
alliance?
>> ELISABETH: That makes me

750
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,317
sick.
I'm not going to sit here being

751
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,820
sick.
I think there's a crack in their

752
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,614
tribe right now.
If you want to stay here, if you

753
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,033
want to keep playing this game,
you better get a little more

754
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:06,292
ruthless sometimes.
>> JEFF V.: I knew this was

755
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:10,170
going to happen because of a
very large mouth of a former

756
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:14,008
tribe member at Kucha, Ogakor
knew I had that vote, and I knew

757
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,801
there was nothing I could do
about it.

758
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:20,180
So I'm going home and I've had
an awesome time.

759
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,976
This has just been the most
amazing experience I've ever had

760
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,769
in my entire life.
