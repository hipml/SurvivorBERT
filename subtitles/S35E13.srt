00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:01,770

HAVE A SEAT!

35
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,177
THIS SEASON, WE STARTED WITH
THREE TRIBES.

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,222
AND BY DESIGN, THE IDEA WAS
LET'S PUT A LOT OF SECRETS IN

37
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,056
THE GAME.

38
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,350
THAT'S WHAT OUR BIG CREATIVE
IDEA WAS.

39
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,351
LET'S HAVE SECRETS.

40
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,312
THEY'LL BE EVERYWHERE.

41
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,356
THEY'LL BLINDSIDE EACH OTHER
WITH SECRETS AND THEN NOBODY IN

42
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,735
THIS GAME COULD KEEP A SINGLE
SECRET PUP NEVER KNOW WHAT

43
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,402
THEY'RE GOING TO DO.

44
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,404

WENT HOME EARLY.

47
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,792
YOU DON'T COME OUT HERE AND GIVE
UP EVERYTHING TO LEAVE EARLY BUT

48
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,334
THAT'S THE WAY THE GAME GOES.

49
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,586
AND WE HAVE OUR JURY.

50
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,379

WE HAVE A COUPLE OF SPOTS LEFT.

52
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,257
ONCE YOU GET TO THE JURY PHASE,
IT GETS COMPLICATED.

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,385
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE OUT
OF THE GAME, THEY ULTIMATELY

54
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,179
HAVE THE FINAL SAY IN WHO WINS
BECAUSE IT'S THEIR VOTES AND

55
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:24,352

BETWEEN THREE OF OUR FINAL FIVE.

169
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,957
>> THERE CAN'T BE ANOTHER ONE.

170
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,250
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS
ANOTHER ONE.

171
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,795
>> THE FACT THAT BEN PLAYED HIS
IDOL, MEANS HE NOW HAS NO IDOL,

172
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,756
WHICH IS LOVELY.

173
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,133
AND, FRANKLY, I'M HAPPY THAT
ASHLEY IS GONE.

174
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,260
SO IT WORKED OUT JUST FINE FOR
ME.

175
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,639
AND NOW I AM IN A GROUP OF FIVE
WHERE FOUR PEOPLE HAVE THE EXACT

176
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,766
SAME TARGET-- BEN.

177
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,601
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE FOUND ANOTHER
IDOL.

178
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,645
I MEAN, THAT REALLY IS SKILL.

179
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:46,108
>> BEN IS LIKE THE BAD GUY IN
ANY HORROR MOVIE-- I JUST KEEP

180
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,319
TRYING TO KILL HIM, AND HE KEEPS
COMING BACK TO LIFE.

181
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,113
>> NOT EVEN ENTERTAIN HEARING
HIM OUT.

182
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,406
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND.

183
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,115
>> YEAH.

184
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,283
>> ONE OF US MUST WIN TOMORROW.

185
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:54,659
>> I KNOW.

186
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,285
>> OH, YEAH.

187
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:56,953
OH, YEAH.

188
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,121
>> BEN NEEDS TO LEAVE THIS GAME.

189
00:08:59,205 --> 00:08:59,956
HE'S VERY DANGEROUS.

190
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,624
YOU KNOW, I DON'T MEAN THE $1
MILLION.

191
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:06,337
I'M PLAYING TO WIN "SURVIVOR"
BECAUSE I AM GOING TO BE THE

192
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,130
ULTIMATE "SURVIVOR."

193
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,801
BEN'S PLAYING BECAUSE HE FEELS
THIS NEED TO WIN THIS MONEY FOR

194
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,972
HIS FAMILY, WHICH MAKES HIM
FEROCIOUS.

195
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,349
>> HOPEFULLY HE DOESN'T FIND
THAT IDOL.

196
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:24,438
>> IT WAS A LONG TRIBAL, AND NOW
WE GET TO SLEEP.

197
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,481
>> I AGREE.

198
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:25,982
>> BRING IT IN.

199
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,486
>> LET'S FINISH IT.

200
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,781
>> I WONDER WHERE HE IS.

201
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,200
>> I'M VULNERABLE, YOU KNOW.

202
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:36,701
I HAVE NO PROTECTION NOW.

203
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,203
I HAVE NO ALLIANCE.

204
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,539
AND I KNOW THEY'RE GUNNING FOR
ME.

205
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,834
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BLOW
UP THEIR GAME IS IF I FIND

206
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,336
ANOTHER IDOL.

207
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,297
IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

208
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,006
NOBODY FOLLOWED ME.

209
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,257
THEY'RE FEELING TOO COMFORTABLE.

210
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,344
I DON'T KNOW WHY BECAUSE AN IDOL
CAN BE PLAYED UNTIL FIVE, SO AS

211
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,848
LONG AS MY HEART IS BEATING, I'M
LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

212
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,349
EVERYBODY'S SLEEPING.

213
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,020
EVERYBODY'S ZONKED OUT, COZY
WITH THEIR BLANKETS AND PILLOWS,

214
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,688
AND I'M OUT HERE FOR MY FAMILY.

215
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,649
SO THERE AIN'T NO TIME FOR
SLEEPING OR REST.

216
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,609
THIS IS MORE THAN A GAME TO ME,
YOU KNOW.

217
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,027
THIS IS A MISSION.

218
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,242
THIS IS A JOB.

219
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,178
>> I'M SO EXHAUSTED.

220
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:41,265
I'M TRYING TO HOLD MY EYES OPEN,
AND I JUST CAN'T.

221
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:41,932
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

222
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,601
AND I CAN'T FIND THIS THING.

223
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,853
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I'M
LETTING MY WIFE DOWN.

224
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,899
BUT I KNOW SHE'LL BE PROUD OF ME
FOR HOW HARD I TRIED.

225
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,026
I'M NOT JUST GOING TO ROLL OVER
AND DIE.

226
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,404
BUT MY BACK SUPAGAINST THE WALL.

227
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,073
OH, MY GOSH!

228
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,199
NO WAY!

229
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,575
NO WAY!

230
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,369
NO WAY!

231
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,412
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

232
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,580
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

233
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,708
I WAS ABOUT TO GET SOME SLEEP,
AND LITERALLY, RIGHT THERE

234
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,921
BEHIND ME, IS THE DING MARK ON
THE GOSH DARN RAFT THAT I'VE

235
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,756
BEEN LOOKING FOR, FOREVER.

236
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,549
NO WAY!

237
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,094
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

238
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,720
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

239
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:24,433
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.

240
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,227
OH, MY GOD!

241
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,271
NUMBER THREE, BABY.

242
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,317
THIS IDOL GUARANTEES ME A SPOT
IN THE FINAL FOUR AND, YOU KNOW,

243
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,153
RYAN, DEVON, CHRISSY AND MIKE
THINK THEY HAVE CONTROL OF THE

244
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,824
GAME, BUT I'LL BE DROPPING A BIG
OLD BEN BOMB AT THE END OF

245
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,449
TRIBAL.

246
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:40,783
YOU THINK I'M GOING HOME?

247
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,910
WATCH THIS.

248
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,802
♪ ♪ ♪
>> ALL RIGHT.

249
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,072
>> NICE JOB, DEVON.

250
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,115
>> SLEEP ALL RIGHT LAST NIGHT?

251
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,075
>> I SLEPT ALL RIGHT.

252
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,412
>> OH, YEAH.

253
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,792
>> MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BEN IS
SO INCREDIBLY COMPLEX.

254
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,086
WE WERE FRIENDS TO THE END, AND
NOW WE CAN'T STAND EACH OTHER.

255
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:02,091
SO I DECIDE THAT I'M GOING TO
APPROACH BEN AND SIMPLY MAKE UP

256
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,468
WITH HIM.

257
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,177
CAN WE BE FRIENDS AGAIN?

258
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,305
>> TOTALLY.

259
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,432
YEAH.

260
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,101
COME HERE, HONEY.

261
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,896
>> WE HUGGED IT OUT AND, YOU
KNOW, NOW I SUPPOSE WE'RE

262
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,981
FRIENDS.

263
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,608
BUT, HONESTLY, IT IS ONLY FOR
GAME PLAY AT THIS POINT.

264
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,442
I REALLY DID MISS YOU.

265
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,111
>> I MISSED YOU, TOO.

266
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,612
I MISSED TALKING WITH YOU.

267
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,239
I MISSED SLEEPING NEXT TO YOU.

268
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,158
>> NOW WE SLEEP NEXT TO EACH
OTHER BUT WITH EIGHT FEET

269
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:28,450
BETWEEN US.

270
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,910
>> YEAH.

271
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:34,957
>> TRUTHFULLY, I STILL DON'T
TRUST BEN AT ALL, BUT FOR GAME

272
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,752
PLAY, I NEEDED TO HAVE HIM THINK
THAT WE WERE WORKING OUR WAY

273
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,920
TOWARDS A BETTER RELATIONSHIP.

274
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,756
BECAUSE IN THE EVENT HE WINS
IMMUNITY, I JUST NEED TO MAKE

275
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,008
SURE I GET TO THE FINAL FOUR.

276
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:51,098
IF YOU WIN TODAY, WOULD YOU EVER
CONSIDER THIS: WOULD YOU RATHER

277
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,517
GIVE THE FINAL THREE TO THE
FINAL THREE BEST PLAYERS IN THE

278
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,643
GAME?

279
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,687
>> WELL, THAT'S THE-- LIKE--
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

280
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,146
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

281
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,231
I DON'T KNOW.

282
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,108
I'M NOT STUPID.

283
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:05,487
CHRISSY'S TRYING TO FINAGLE HER
WAY IN, IF I WIN INDIVIDUAL

284
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,238
IMMUNITY.

285
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,823
AND IT AIN'T GOING TO WORK AT
ALL.

286
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:12,328
IF YOU WIN, IMMUNITY TODAY, ARE
YOU GOING TO TAKE ME?

287
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,037
I DON'T THINK SO.

288
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,996
>> YEAH.

289
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,164
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

290
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,375
>> OKAY, SO JUST IN THE IDEA
ANYWAY THAT IF YOU END UP--

291
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,335
>> YEAH.

292
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,169
I'LL GIVE IT TO THE LADY, PROPS
TO HER.

293
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,004
AT LEAST SHE'S TRYING.

294
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,883
BUT YOU'RE BARKING UP THE WRONG
TREE THERE, SISTER.

295
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,887
CHRISSY IS MY BIGGEST
COMPETITOR.

296
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,514
SHE'S BUILDING A RESUME AT THIS
POINT.

297
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,016
SHE COULD WIN THE MILLION
DOLLARS.

298
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,352
>> IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK
ABOUT.

299
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:41,357
>> I DON'T WANT HER IN THE GAME
ANY LONG LONGER.

300
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:51,408
I'M GOING TO PLAY MY IDOL AND
SHE'S GONE.

301
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:59,083
I'M GOING TO PLAY MY IDOL AND
SHE'S GONE.

302
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,836
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SHALL WE
GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY DISMJ.

303
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,254
>> YES.

304
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,715
>> Jeff: CHRISSY FOR THE
SECOND TIME, I HAVE TO TAKE IT

305
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,134
BACK.

306
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,552
>> HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON.

307
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,470
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

308
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:16,517
RAONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK U
FOR GRABS.

309
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,103
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO SWIM OUT TO A PLATFORM,

310
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:27,111
CLIMB UP A STACK OF CRATES, LEAP
OFF, AND RETRIEVE A SET OF KEYS.

311
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:31,240
YOU'LL THEN CROSS A BALANCE BEAM
AND RETRIEVE A SECOND SET OF

312
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,616
KEYS.

313
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:38,205
YOU'LLIZE THOYOU'LL USE THOSE KE
YOUR PUZZLE.

314
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,375
FINALLY, YOU'LL MANEUVER BALLS
TO MATCH THE CORRESPONDING

315
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,626
COLOR.

316
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,713
FIRST PERSON TO LINE THEIR BALLS
UP WITH THE COLORS ON THE WHEEL,

317
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,258
WINS IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A SPOT
IN THE FINAL FOUR.

318
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,261
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE SEVENTH

319
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,763
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

320
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,933
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.

321
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,143
>> YES!

322
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,769
>> Jeff: YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?

323
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,937
>> YES.

324
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,315
>> Jeff: THE WINNER WILL ENJOY
BACK AT CAMP GOOD OLD COMFORT

325
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:05,941
FOOD.

326
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:06,191
CHICKEN, MASHED POTATOES.

327
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,276
>> OH!

328
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,945
>> Jeff: GRAVY, VEGGIES.

329
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:10,863
>> OH, MY!

330
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,323
>> Jeff: WINE, AND CHEESECAKE
FOR DESSERT.

331
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,283
>> CHEESECAKE!

332
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,409
THAT'S MY FAVORITE!

333
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,620
>> Jeff: BIG BOOST GOING INTO
THESE LAST FEW DAYS, HUGE

334
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,288
STAKES.

335
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,124
I KNOW IT'S WORTH PLAYING FOR.

336
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,626
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPORTS.

337
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,840
WE'LL GET STARTED.

338
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,469
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

339
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:38,307
FOR IMMUNITY, A GUARANTEED SPOT
IN THE FINAL FOUR, AND REWARD.

340
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,518
SURVIVORS READY?

341
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:47,357
GO!

342
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,320
YOUR FIRST STEP IS TO RETRIEVE
THOSE FIRST SET OF KEYS.

343
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,324
DEVON FLYING THROUGH IT, TAKES
HIS LEAP, HE'S GOT IT.

344
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,450
RYAN HAS HIS!

345
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,493
MIKE HAS HIS!

346
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,285
BEN'S GOT HIS!

347
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,831
CHRISSY LAST TO GET THERE.

348
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,876
CHRISSY HAS HERS.

349
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,545
EVERYBODY NOW HAS THEIR FIRST
SET.

350
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,548
DEVON NOW ON TO THE BEAM.

351
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,300
RYAN CRAWLING OUT.

352
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:13,801
RYAN DROPS.

353
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,676
HE'S GOT TO GO BACK.

354
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,346
MIKE IS GOING TO CRAWL ACROSS
THAT BEAM.

355
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,723
HERE COMES CHRISSY, DEAD LAST.

356
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,184
BEN NOW ON THE BEAM.

357
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,896
IT IS DEVON WORKING ON THOSE
KNOTS.

358
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,981
MIKE WORKING ON THE KNOTS.

359
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,692
DEVON TRYING TO HANG IN THERE,
HE CAN'T.

360
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,027
DEVON'S GOT TO GO BACK.

361
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,446
AND IT'S GOING TO GO MIKE FIRST
ACROSS WITH HIS SECOND SET OF

362
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,072
KEYS.

363
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:39,910
WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT!

364
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,702
DEVON'S ACROSS.

365
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,705
YOU'RE GOOD!

366
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,040
RYAN DROPS AGAIN.

367
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:45,874
HE'S GOT TO GO BACK.

368
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,211
DEVON AND MIKE REACH THE FINAL
STAGE.

369
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,879
UNLOCK YOUR PUZZLE!

370
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,713
HERE COMES CHRISSY.

371
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,758
SHE IS QUICKLY TRYING TO MAKE UP
GROUND.

372
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,926
BEN IS ACROSS NOW.

373
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,219
HE'S GOOD.

374
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,889
IT IS NOW RYAN LEFT ALONE TRYING
TO GET ACROSS THAT BEAM WITH HIS

375
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,225
SECOND SET OF KEYS.

376
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:07,896
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO FIND WHICH KEY
OPENOPENS THAT PUZZLE AND START

377
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,527
SOLVING IT.

378
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,236
RYAN'S ACROSS.

379
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,697
HE'S GOOD!

380
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,532
CHRISSY HAS HER PUZZLE UNLOCKED.

381
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,909
SHE IS QUICKLY BACK IN THIS.

382
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,538
YOU'VE GOT TO MANEUVER THE BALLS
THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND MATCH IT

383
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,290
WITH THE CORRESPONDING COLOR.

384
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,251
RYAN LAST TO GET HERE.

385
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,088
NOW HE'S GOT TO GET HIS PUZZLE
UNLOCKED.

386
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,465
BEN HAS HIS PUZZLE UNLOCKED.

387
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:40,095
MIKE WAS FIRST TO GET ACROSS,
BUT HAS LOST A LOT OF TIME

388
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,389
TRYING TO FIND THE KEY TO OPEN
HIS PUZZLE.

389
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:47,728
NOW MIKE'S IN IT.

390
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:52,232
ANOTHER COMPLICATED AND
BRAND-NEW "SURVIVOR" PUZZLE.

391
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,903
YOU'RE GOING TO SPIN THAT WHEEL
AND MOVE THE BALLS AROUND UNTIL

392
00:19:55,986 --> 00:20:00,282
ALL OF THE BALLS LINE UP WITH
ALL OF THE MATCHING COLORS.

393
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,286
ONCE YOU START FIGURING OUT HOW
THIS WORKS, YOU CAN START MOVING

394
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,495
FAST.

395
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,625
BUT THE KEY TO THIS CHALLENGE IS
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK

396
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,461
SEVERAL MOVES AHEAD AND FIGURE
OUT WHERE THESE BALLS NEED TO

397
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,464
GET TO AND HOW TO GET THEM
THERE.

398
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,798
MIKE MOVING NICELY NOW.

399
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,301
HE'S GOT SOMETHING GOING.

400
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,096
CHRISSY HAS BEEN MOVING FAST
FROM THE BEGINNING, LIKE SHE

401
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,639
KNOWS THIS PUZZLE.

402
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,474
BEN NOW MOVING NICELY.

403
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,518
BEN IS MAKING PROGRESS.

404
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:33,649
IT IS BEN, CHRISSY, AND MIKE
RIGHT NOW, WITH RYAN AND DEVON

405
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,983
GETTING LOST.

406
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:40,405
THE ONLY PERSON LEFT IN THE GAME
THAT HAS WON AN IMMUNITY IS

407
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:40,822
CHRISSY.

408
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,074
SHE'S WON TWO.

409
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,494
IMMUNITY AT TRIBAL IS THE SINGLE
GREATEST FEELING YOU CAN HAVE AT

410
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,662
TRIBAL.

411
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,333
THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE YOU
LIVE TO SEE DAY 38 IS RIGHT

412
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,542
HERE.

413
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:57,172
THIS COULD COME DOWN TO A FEW
MOVES, AND WHO WILL GET THERE

414
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:59,508
FIRST.

415
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,969
>> JEFF.

416
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:09,893
>> Jeff: CHRISSY THINKS SHE
HAS IT.

417
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,019
CHRISSY HAS IT!

418
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,357
CHRISSY WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A SPOT IN

419
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:23,240
THE FINAL FOUR AND A NICE REWARD
BACK AT CAMP!

420
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,408
>> NICE JOB, CHRISSY.

421
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:29,496
>> THANK YOU.

422
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:35,377
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, COME ON
OVER.

423
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,715
THIRD INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WIN
PUTS YOU WITHIN ONE OF THE

424
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,843
RECORD ON "SURVIVOR" BY WOMEN IN
THIS GAME AT FOUR.

425
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:47,723
MORE IMPORTANTLY, GUARANTEES YOU
A SPOT IN THE FINAL FOUR, ONE

426
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,516
STEP CLOSER TO THE END.

427
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,602
AND YOU HAVE REWARD BACK AT
CAMP.

428
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,022
COMFORT FOOD FOR ONE WOULD BE
NICE WITH TWO.

429
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,775
BRING ONE PERSON TO JOIN YOU.

430
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,363
>> I WOULD LIKE TO BRING DOCTOR
MIKE.

431
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,866
>> Jeff: DOCTOR MIKE COME ON
OVER.

432
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,616
>> THANK YOU.

433
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,035
>> I WENT WITH HIM ON THE LAST
ONE.

434
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,161
>> THANK YOU.

435
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,580
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, CHRISSY,
THERE IS ENOUGH FOOD FOR ONE

436
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,372
MORE.

437
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,874
>> I THINK I'D LIKE TO BRING
DEVON.

438
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,416
>> Jeff: DEVON, COME ON OVER.

439
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:14,833
JOIN US.

440
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,292
>> THANK YOU.

441
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,501
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

442
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,547
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO BACK AT
CAMP, YOU GUYS WILL ENJOY THE

443
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,423
FOOD.

444
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,009
RYAN AND BEN, YOU'LL ENJOY--
>> NOTHING.

445
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,261
>> Jeff: YOU'RE RIGHT, I GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU.

446
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:29,264
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT WILL
BECOME THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF OUR

447
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:29,765
JURY.

448
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,433
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.

449
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,601
CONGRATS.

450
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,936
GRAB YOUR STF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

451
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,397
>> CHRISSY IS UNBEATABLE.

452
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,607
I'M BUMMED SHE WON BECAUSE I WAS
GUNNING FOR HER.

453
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,610
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE
BEST WAY TO USE THIS IDOL AND

454
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,488
MAKE A DECISION ON WHO IS GOING

455
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,680
♪ ♪ ♪
>> OH, MY GOD.

456
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,599
>> OH, WE EACH HAVE OUR OWN
CHICKEN!

457
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,725
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

458
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,479
>> GUYS, DO YOU THINK--
>> WE EACH HAVE OUR OWN CHICKEN.

459
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,940
>> DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CLUE
HERE TO THE IDOL.

460
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:24,194
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A CLUE
HERE SO CAN WE JUST LOOK FOR TWO

461
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:24,653
SECONDS.

462
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,362
>> THERE MIGHT BE.

463
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,698
>> LOOK UNDER ALL THE CHICKENS.

464
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:34,621
>> NO CHICKENS, NO NAPKINS.

465
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,289
>> WE'RE GOOD.

466
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,667
>> LET'S EAT.

467
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,670
>> IF BEN SOMEHOW CAN FIND
ANOTHER IDOL, THEN THIS GAME

468
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,921
COULD BLOW UP YET AGAIN.

469
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:47,050
SO THE FIRST THING WE DID AT THE
REWARD WAS WENT THROUGH EVERY

470
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,219
SCRAP OF EVERYTHING LOOKING FOR
A CLUE, AND THERE WAS NOTHING.

471
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,848
>> WITH KWE PLEASE CHEERS TO US
THREE AND RYAN BEING FINAL FOUR.

472
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,849
>> YES!

473
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:54,516
OH, YES!

474
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,684
>> OKAY.

475
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,020
>> TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL IS
ABOUT TRIMMING THE FAT, AND

476
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,272
GETTING TO THE FINAL FOUR.

477
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:04,234
MY ENTIRE GAME AT THIS POINT IS
FOCUSED AROUND GETTING BEN OUT.

478
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,527
>> SO CAN WE DISCUSS THE
POSSIBILITY OF BEN PLAYING

479
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,821
ANOTHER FREAKING IDOL TONIGHT?

480
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,322
>> NO WAY.

481
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:09,781
I'M VOTING BEN.

482
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,574
>> I'M VOTING BEN.

483
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,867
>> I'M VOTING BEN.

484
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:17,205
>> AND IF I GO BECAUSE HE PLAYS
THE THIRD IDOL IN A ROW, THEN SO

485
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,331
BE IF.

486
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:22,502
>> YEAH, BUT GOOD FOR US, THAT
RYAN IS BABY-SITTING BEN.

487
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,506
>> SO YOU GOT BABY SITTING
DUTIES WHILE THEY'RE OFF EATING.

488
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,593
THAT'S THE WAY THEY FIGURED,
HUH?

489
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,219
IT DOES KIND OF SUCK.

490
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,179
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME.

491
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,430
>> YEAH.

492
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:39,686
>> IF WE COULD FIND THE IMMUNITY
IDOL, AND I'LL WEAR THE IMMUNITY

493
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,565
NECKLACE, THEN WE'LL GIVE
SOMEONE THE DEAD SUPER IMMUNITY

494
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,274
NECKLACE.

495
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,401
AND JUST BE LIKE, "SORRY, DUDE."

496
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,569
>> HOLD ON.

497
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,405
YOU HAVE A NECKLACE ASSOCIATED
WITH YOUR SUPER IMMUNITY?

498
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,489
>> IT'S DEAD.

499
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,284
IT'S BEEN-- IT ONLY WAS-- IT
ONLY WAS GOOD FOR A DAY.

500
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,619
>> WE COULD PLANT IT.

501
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,787
>> BUT WE CAN, ONE, PLANT IT.

502
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:02,876
OR, TWO, WE CAN TELL BEN WE HAD
A CLUE AND FOUND THE IDOL.

503
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,544
IT WOULD BE LIKE, BEN YOU'RE
DONE.

504
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,378
>> PERFECT.

505
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,713
>> I MEAN, THIS IS THE BEST PLAN
EVER.

506
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,090
IT'S GOING TO MAKE-- IT'S GOING
TO SHUT HIM DOWN.

507
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,759
HE'LL JUST LAY IN THE SHELTER
ALL DAY.

508
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,928
>> HOW FUN WOULD THAT BE?

509
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,056
BEN HAS PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE
INCREDIBLE AT FINDING IDOLS.

510
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:22,229
SO THE PLAN IS SIMPLY TO USE
THAT DEAD SUPER IMMUNITY IDOL

511
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,981
THAT RYAN GAVE ME AT THE FIRST
TRIBAL COUNCIL, PUT IT TOGETHER

512
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:29,986
WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM
RYAN'S ACTUAL IDOL THAT WAS

513
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,238
PLAYED.

514
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,739
AND TELL BEN THAT WE FOUND THE
IDOL SO THAT HE'LL STOP LOOKING

515
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,532
THIS AFTERNOON.

516
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,826
IT'S SO BRILLIANT.

517
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,664
>> I'M GOING TO GO FILL MY
WATER.

518
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,790
I'M GOING TO START LOOKING.

519
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:46,962
>> DON'T WASTE TOO MUCH ENERGY.

520
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,506
>> WHAT IS THAT?

521
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,674
>> WOW!

522
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,925
WELL DONE.

523
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,301
>> NO WAY!

524
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,970
FOR REAL?

525
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:55,804
YOU FOUND AN IDOL?

526
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,638
>> IT WAS MORE THAN A REWARD.

527
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:02,602
>> LET ME SEE-- LET ME SEE THE
PAPER.

528
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,980
OH, WOW.

529
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,439
THAT'S A FANCY ONE, TOO.

530
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,026
>> I'M JUST TELLING YOU, YOU
MIGHT AS WELL NOT WASTE YOUR

531
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,652
ENERGY.

532
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,988
I MEAN, SAVE YOUR ENERGY.

533
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:17,575
>> AN IDOL AT A REWARD, HUH?

534
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,286
>> NOTHING LIKE TWO IN ONE DAY.

535
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,495
( LAUGHS )
WELL.

536
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:24,332
>> I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE I'LL
WEAR ON TOP, BUT, CLEARLY, I'LL

537
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:24,666
BE GIVING THIS ONE AWAY TONIGHT.

538
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,167
>> TO ME?

539
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:26,751
>> NO.

540
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,795
>> WELL, THAT'S A DOWNER.

541
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:34,801
I FIGURED IF I DIDN'T WIN TODAY,
I WAS GOING HOME ANYWAY.

542
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:40,807
WELL, I'M GOING TO GO GET SOME
WATER.

543
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,061
>> I WOULD SAY THAT WENT WELL.

544
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,855
( LOUVRES )
THAT WAS SO GOOD.

545
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:52,193
>> OH, MAN, HE BOUGHT IT HOOK,
LINE, AND SINKER, AND IT REALLY

546
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,361
WORKED TO PERFECTION.

547
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,823
HE WAS SHOCKED, AND THAT LET US
ALL KNOW HE DOES NOT HAVE A

548
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,576
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, WHICH IS A
VERY GOOD THING.

549
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,827
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

550
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,914
THERE AIN'T NO WAY IT'S A REAL
IDOL BECAUSE I GOT THE ONE IN MY

551
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,290
BOOT.

552
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,208
OH, MY GOD.

553
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,046
HOW EPIC IS THIS?

554
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,214
"WELL DON'T WASTE TOO MUCH
ENERGY."

555
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,133
CLASSIC, CLASSIC.

556
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,843
IT'S A GOOD-LOOKING FAKE IDOL,
TOO.

557
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,513
NOW I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO FAKE
LOOK FOR IDOLS NO MORE.

558
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,932
SHE JUST MADE MY JOB EASIER.

559
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:23,892
YEAH, TWO-FER.

560
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,394
GOT ME A TWO-FER.

561
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,063
NOPE, NO, YOU DIDN'T.

562
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,731
YOU GOT A ONE-FER.

563
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,359
I'M ONE STEP HAEFD THEM THROUGH
THIS WHOLE DARN GAME.

564
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,693
>> IS THAT THE IDOL?

565
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,402
YOU FOUND IT?

566
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,612
>> YEAH.

567
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:39,199
>> THESE FOUR THINK THEY'RE SO
SMART, BUT IT'S LIKE A BUNCH OF

568
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,784
BLIND MICE JUST RUNNING AROUND
BUMPING INTO STUFF.

569
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,911
>> OH!

570
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,912
>> NOBODY SAW THAT.

571
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,705
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

572
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,873
>> OH, YEAH, I'M FINE.

573
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,999
I JUST FELL.

574
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,876
>> I THINK THEY DO UNDERESTIMATE
ME, YOU KNOW.

575
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,754
AND IT'S HILARIOUS FOR ME.

576
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,298
BUT ONE OF THEM'S STILL GOING
HOME.

577
00:27:55,382 --> 00:28:00,136
I MEAN AT THIS POINT I KIND OF
GOT MY HAND ON EVERYONE'S FATE.

578
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,931
TONIGHT, IT COMES DOWN TO WHO I
CAN BEAT.

579
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,933
AND THE CHALLENGE TOMORROW.

580
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:09,604
RYAN IS SAFE BECAUSE AS FAR AS
CHALLENGES GO, THAT BOY AIN'T

581
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:09,938
DONE NOTHING.

582
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,688
>> COOL!

583
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,775
>> SO IT'S BETWEEN MIKE AND
DEVON.

584
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,360
>> WE'RE SET, DUDE!

585
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,947
>> SO PHYSICALLY, DEVON IS THE
STRONGEST COMPETITOR.

586
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:24,077
BUT DOC, HE'S GOOD AT CHALLENGES
AND HE'S GOOD AT SOLVING

587
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,619
PUZZLES.

588
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,495
NOT FAST, BUT HE'S GOOD.

589
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,622
SO THIS DECISION IS HUGE.

590
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,123
>> I KNOW YOU'RE BUMMED.

591
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,791
>> I'M NOT BUMMED.

592
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,250
>> YOU'RE NOT?

593
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,794
>> NO, DUDE.

594
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,087
I'M GOING TO HAVE A MEAL
TONIGHT.

595
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,296
>> YEAH.

596
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,298
>> I WOULD HAVE RATHER HAVE
LIKED TO MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS

597
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:37,799
BUT, WHATEVER.

598
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,633
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

599
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:41,344
>> I'M GETTING A WEIRD FEELING
FROM BEN.

600
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,013
HE'S ACTING LIKE HE'S GIVINGIP
IN THIS GAME.

601
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,808
BUT HE WOULDN'T JUST GIVE UP
LIKE THAT.

602
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,225
BEN'S A GOOD PLAYER.

603
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,476
HE'S DANGEROUS.

604
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,649
HE MAY JUST BE ACTING ONE WAY SO
THAT WE THINK HE HASN'T FOUND A

605
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,066
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

606
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,484
IT'S TERRIFYING.

607
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,736
>> DO YOU KNOW WHOSE NAME HE'S
WRITING DOWN?

608
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,697
>> NO.

609
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,281
>> I'M VOTING BEN.

610
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,658
>> YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

611
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:07,078
>> SO YOU'RE CERTAIN HE DOESN'T
HAVE AN IDOL.

612
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,957
BECAUSE I'M THINKING OF PUTTING
DOC'S NAME DOWN TONIGHT JUST IN

613
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,249
CASE.

614
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:11,666
>> WHY?

615
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:12,459
>> I DON'T KNOW.

616
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,251
>> I MEAN, I FOLLOWED HIM ALL
DAY.

617
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,878
>> YEAH, BUT IT COULDN'T HURT,
RIGHT?

618
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,880
>> I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD DO
THAT.

619
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,007
JUST, YOU KNOW--
>> PIS HIM OFF?

620
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,884
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW.

621
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,720
>> I'M GOING TO SEE HOW TRIBAL
GOES TONIGHT.

622
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,512
>> UH-HUH.

623
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,222
>> AS LONG AS YOU'RE CERTAIN--
OKAY.

624
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,182
ALL RIGHT.

625
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,517
I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S
NO MORE IDOLS.

626
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,229
I MEAN, FOR BEN TO FIND ANOTHER
ONE WOULD BE CRAZY, BUT MAYBE IF

627
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,023
I VOTE MIKE, IT'S KIND OF
PROVIDE MEEG WITH A LITTLE

628
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,191
SAFETY NET.

629
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,695
THE SUPER BOWL, MIKE WILL BE
PISSED OFF AT ME, AND WOULDN'T

630
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,697
TAKE ME IN THE FINAL THREE.

631
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,159
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS OUR REAL
SHOT WHERE WE ACTUALLY FEEL

632
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,869
LIKE, FINALLY, WE'RE GETTING RID
OF BEN.

633
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:52,040
I JUST GOT TO PRAY THAT BEN
DOESN'T PULL OFF A MIRACLE

634
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,792
TONIGHT.

635
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,963

>> Jeff: SO MUCH GAME PLAY

636
00:29:59,047 --> 00:29:59,714
HAPPENING.

637
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:00,882
CHRISSY'S ON FIRE.

638
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,050
SHE'S UNBEATABLE.

639
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,676
THE FOUR ARE GLOATING.

640
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,720
THEY THINK THEY'RE SENDING BEN
HOME.

641
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,555
BUT BEN KNOWS THAT ISN'T
HAPPENING.

642
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,643
BUT THE QUESTION-- THE QUESTION
IS DEVON.

643
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,061
HE SUSPECTS SOMETHING'S OFF.

644
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,938
HE'S CONSIDERING VOTING FOR
MIKE, BUT IT'S RISKY BECAUSE IF

645
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:18,024
YOU'RE WRONG, IT CAN COST YOU.

646
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,943
ONE BAD DECISION IN THIS GAME
HAUNT YOU FOREVER.

647
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,237
STAND UP, YOU YOU GUYS.

648
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,279
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

649
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,073
>> ORIGINALLY FROM NEW YORK, BUT
WE LIVE HERE IN L.A.

650
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,408
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DO
YOU DO IN THIS CASE?

651
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,870
IF YOU'RE DEVON AND YOU'VE GOT A
WEIRD SENSE BUT YOU'RE IN AN

652
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,663
ALLIANCE WITH FOUR?

653
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,249
>> YOUR GUT, YOU HAVE TWOOG YOUR
GUT.

654
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,126
>> I MEAN, IF YOU'RE DEVON, YOU
HAVE TO ENSURE YOU'RE IN THIS

655
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,253
GAME ANOTHER DAY.

656
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,923
SO IF YOU'VE GOT TO PUT MIKE'S
NAME DOWN, PUT IT DOWN.

657
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,049
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

658
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,386
SEE, AND THAT'S WHY THIS GAME
CONTINUES TO ENTERTAIN US.

659
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,889
IT'S A STRATEGY, AND YOU CAN
PLAY ALONG AT HOME BECAUSE YOU

660
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,643
HAVE TO BE PLAYING AT A HIGH
LEVEL, AND IF YOU'RE NOT THE ONE

661
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,144
MAKING THE MOVE, SOMEBODY ELSE
PROBABLY IS.

662
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,939
I TOTAL YOU, IT'S A BATTLE TO
THE END "SURVIVOR" FINALE.

00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,477
>> YEAH, IT'S VERY CLEAR.

685
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,023
HE'S THROWN HIS MOVES OUT THERE,
KIND OF IN-YOUR-FACE MOVES.

686
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:26,027
HE'S NOT ONE TO STAY BEHIND THE
CURTAINS AND MAKE SECRET MOVES.

687
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,362
HE'S JUST OUT HERE TO PLAY.

688
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,031
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, AT THE LAST
TRIBAL, YOU WERE SURPRISED THAT

689
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,866
BEN HAD AN IDOL.

690
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:35,036
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN WHEN BEN IS
THE COMMON ENEMY?

691
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,205
WHY IS HE LEFT ALONE TO FIND AN
IDOL?

692
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:41,042
>> AS MUCH AS WE TRY TO BABY SIT
A PERSON AROUND CAMP, WE JUST

693
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,003
CAN'T BE WITH THEM 24 HOURS A
DAY.

694
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,714
I MEAN, HE'S GETTING UP IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND RUNNING

695
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,049
AROUND LOOKING FOR IDOLS.

696
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,511
I MEAN, WE'RE AT DAY 37, AND
WE'RE ALL EXHAUSTED AND RUNNING

697
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,595
ON FUMES.

698
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,348
AND WE'RE JUST HOPING SOMEBODY
ELSE WILL TAKE THAT ON.

699
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:59,394
>> Jeff: MIKE, DOES THAT FEEL
TRUE TO YOU, THAT MAYBE IT IS A

700
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,188
COMBINATION OF THE FOUR OF YOU
THINKING IN SIMILAR WAYS, AND

701
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,566
THEN HOPING SOMEBODY ELSE IS
ACTUALLY DOING THE HARD WORK?

702
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:10,071
>> I THINK THAT I SPENT MY FAIR
SHARE OF TIME WITH BEN OR

703
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,322
WATCHING BEN.

704
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,283
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, BEN HAS
BEEN A GREAT BUFFENER THIS GAME,

705
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,493
RIGHT?

706
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,079
LIKE, EVERY TIME BEN IS STILL
HERE, THERE'S A COMMON ENEMY.

707
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,916
>> Jeff: AND, CHRISSY, WHILE
MIKE WAS TALKING, YOU PULLED

708
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,084
SOMETHING OUT.

709
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,087
>> SO, THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
WAS THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON

710
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:26,963
GIVING.

711
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,589
NOT ONLY --
>> I'LL SAY IT FOR YOU-- NOT

712
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,926
ONLY DO YOU WIN YOUR THIRD
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, WHICH PUTS

713
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,430
YOU WITHIN ONE OF THE RECORD FOR
A WOMAN IN THIS GAME-- FOUR.

714
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,139
>> RIGHT, THANK YOU.

715
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,724
>> Jeff: YOU ALSO WIN REWARD.

716
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,267
>> I WIN REWARD.

717
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,271
AND I TOOK MIKE AND DEVON TO A
FEAST BACK AT CAMP.

718
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,065
AND WHILE I WAS THERE, I FOUND A
CLUE TO THE IDOL AND WENT AND

719
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,275
DUG IT UP.

720
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,445
AND I ACTUALLY DID END UP SORT
OF DOING WHAT BEN DID, WHICH WAS

721
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,280
PLAYING THE CARDS OUT IN THE
OPEN.

722
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,366
SO THE PLAN IS JUST BY THE END
OF THE NIGHT, I'LL GIVE IT TO

723
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,285
ONE OF THESE GUYS SINCE,
OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T NEED BOTH.

724
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,455
>> Jeff: SO, BEN, HOW DID
CHRISSY DELIVER THE NEWS TO YOU

725
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,706
ABOUT THE IDOL?

726
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,333
>> I WAS GOING TO GO GET SOME
WATER AND LOOK FOR AN IDOL, AND

727
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,128
SHE SAID, "WELL, DON'T WASTE
YOUR ENERGY."

728
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,672
AND THEN SHE PULLED IT OUT AND
SHOWED IT TO ME.

729
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,967
AND, YEAH, IT WAS PRETEE THAT
WAS A HEARTBREAKER.

730
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,343
>> Jeff: AND DID THE VIBE AT
CAMP CHANGE AFTER THAT?

731
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,261
>> YUP.

732
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:19,474
THESE GUYS ARE ALL PRETTY HAPPY
ABOUT IT.

733
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,142
MY CHANCES OF STAYING IN THE
GAME WAS EITHER TO WIN THE

734
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,311
IMMUNITY NECKLACE OR FIND THE
IDOL.

735
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,522
AND CHRISSY HAD QUITE THE DAY
TODAY.

736
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:31,235
>> Jeff: DEVON, HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE IT IN TERMS OF GRACEFUL

737
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,236
OR GLOATING?

738
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,322
>> I DON'T THINK CHRISSY WAS
GLOATING IN ANY WAY.

739
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,492
I THINK SHE WAS BEING MORE
GRACEFUL.

740
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,327
>> IT WAS 100% GLOATING, JEFF.

741
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,997
SHE WAS ON CLOUD NINE WITH HER
LITTLE NECKLACE, AND I THINK YOU

742
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,166
SAID, "OH, IT WAS A GREAT DAY.

743
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,669
IT WAS A TWO-FEREDAY," OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

744
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,672
>> I MIGHT HAVE SAID IT WAS A
TWO-FEREDAY.

745
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,131
I'M PROUD OF MY DAY.

746
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,508
I HAD A GOOD DAY.

747
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,718
>> Jeff: BEN, WHAT'S IT FEEL
LIKE TO SIT WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT

748
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,804
NOW AND KNOW THAT THE END COULD
BE TONIGHT?

749
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,055
>> IT'S PRETTY ROUGH.

750
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,183
I CAME OUT HERE TO WIN A MILLION
DOLLARS FOR MY WIFE AND MY KIDS.

751
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,727
YOU KNOW, IT SUCKS.

752
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,313
IT SUCKS, FLAT OUT, JEFF.

753
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:11,692
TO SEE THE DREAMS GET RUIN BY
THESE FOUR-- AND GOOD ON THEM.

754
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,402
BUT IT'S A HARD PILL TO SWALLOW.

755
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:17,532
>> Jeff: RYAN, WHEN YOU HEAR
BEN SAY THAT, IT'S SORT OF THE

756
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:22,161
TRUTH FOR EVERYBODY WHO GETS
VOTED OUT IS THEY, IN ESSENCE,

757
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,330
THEY ARE BLAMING EVERYBODY ELSE
FOR KILLING THEIR GAME.

758
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,542
AND, YET, THAT'S THE POINT OF
THE GAME.

759
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,211
>> BEN REALLY COMPLETELY
DESTROYED THE GAME.

760
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,381
I HAD TO COMPLETELY READJUST MY
GAME AND RETOOL TO GET TO THE

761
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,341
POINT WHERE I AM AT TODAY.

762
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,342
I DON'T KNOW.

763
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:40,721
I DON'T LIKE BLINDSIDING OR
VOTING ANYBODY OUT.

764
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,891
I LOVE THIS GAME, BUT THAT IS
NOT SOMETHING I TAKE JOY IN.

765
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,687
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, US
FOUR HAD THE NUMBERS, AND IT

766
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,022
JUST SO HAPPENED THAT HE WAS ON
THE OUTSIDE OF THEM, AND

767
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,440
THAT'S-- THAT'S THE GAME.

768
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,777
>> Jeff: OKAY, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.

769
00:35:54,861 --> 00:36:01,909
MIKE, YOU'RE UP.

770
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:20,511
>> OH, MAN.

771
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:26,517
>> OH, MAN.

772
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:38,070
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

773
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,115
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

774
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,034
TONIGHT IS THE LAST TIME YOU CAN
DO SO.

775
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,160
>> DOES ANYBODY WANT THIS?

776
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,788
>> NO.

777
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,458
>> OKAY.

778
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:57,131
( WHISTLING )
( EXPLOSION )

779
00:36:57,214 --> 00:37:00,676
BEN BOMB!

780
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,886
LA-LA-LA!

781
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,806
WHILE YOU GUYS WERE SLEEPING,
WHAT'S THAT SAYING, "THE EARLY

782
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:11,479
BIRD GETS THE WORM?"
>> OH, MY GOSH!

783
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,856
>> Jeff:
>> JEFF.

784
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,152
>> THIS GUY IS INSANE.

785
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,279
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

786
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,531
ANY VOTES CAST FOR BEN WILL NOT
COUNT.

787
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,991
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

788
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,828
>> SINCE WE'RE PULLING FAKE
IDOLS OUT, I MIGHT AS WELL GET

789
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,830
MINE OUT, TOO.

790
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,624
>> Jeff: FIRST VOTE, BEN.

791
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,708
DOES NOT COUNT.

792
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,835
>> WELL PLAYED, BEN.

793
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,380
>> Jeff: BEN, DOES NOT COUNT.

794
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:45,554
BEN, DOES NOT COUNT.

795
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:53,521
DR. MIKE, ONE VOTE DR. MIKE, ONE
VOTE LEFT.

796
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:53,771
DEVON.

797
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,355
>> OH!

798
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,315
>> Jeff: WE HAVE A TIE.

799
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,903
ONE VOTE MIKE, ONE VOTE DEVON.

800
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,529
>> DID YOU WRITE DOWN MY NAME?

801
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:07,201
>> I DID.

802
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,077
SORRY, MIKE.

803
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,453
>> Jeff: SO HERE'S WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.

804
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,663
WE'RE GOING TO REVOTE.

805
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:14,083
WE WILL ONLY VOTE FOR MIKE OR
DEVON, AND MIKE AND DEVON WILL

806
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:14,875
NOT VOTE.

807
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,503
BEN, YOU WANT TO COME GRAB THE
URN?

808
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,673
>> NOW YOUR FAITH IS IN THOSE
TWO.

809
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:31,767
>> YEAH, IT IS.

810
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:51,746
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

811
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,583
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

812
00:38:55,666 --> 00:39:05,259
FIRST VOTE, DEVON.

813
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:06,177
MIKE.

814
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,973
ONE VOTE MIKE, ONE VOTE DEVON,
ONE VOTE LEFT.

815
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,894
14th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

816
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:15,603
MIKE.

817
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,479
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

818
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:25,112
>> GOOD GAME, GUYS.

819
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:29,533
>> YOU LIVED YOUR DREAM.

820
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:37,792
>> Jeff: MIKE, THE TWRIEB HAS
SPOKEN.

821
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,044
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

822
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,378
>> SEE YOU, DOC.

823
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:41,962
LOVE YOU.

824
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,130
>> GOOD LUCK, EVERYBODY!

825
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,423
>> WE LOVE YOU!

826
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,594
>> THANKS, MIKE.

827
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,721
>> Jeff: WELL,
CONGRATULATIONS.

828
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,391
YOU HAVE MADE IT TO THE FINAL
FOUR.

829
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,937
TOMORROW, YOU'LL COMPETE IN YOUR
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

830
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,941
AND TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO
SLEEP ON, THERE'S A TWIST.

831
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:02,733
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

832
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,526
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

833
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,944
GOOD NIGHT.

834
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,989
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE LITERALLY
GOING TO GIVE US SOMETHING TO

835
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,660
SLEEP ON.

836
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,831
>> I THINK THEY FELT LIKE THEY
NEEDED DEVON MORE THAN THEY

837
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,582
NEEDED ME IN ORDER TO BEAT BEN.

838
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,792
>> AND GET IT.

839
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,795
IF I MADE IT TO THE FINAL THREE,
I WOULD HAVE WON "SURVIVOR."

840
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:26,006
BUT I MADE IT 37 DAYS IN THE
GREATEST GAME EVER INVENTED ON

841
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,386
THE FACE OF THIS EARTH.

842
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,724
<i>( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
>> Jeff: HE DID IT!

843
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:40,688
IT WAS A HUGE MOVE, BUT THAT IS
HOW YOU PLAY "SURVIVOR."

844
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,856
DEVON HAD A BAD FEELING.

845
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:46,694
HE LISTENED TO HIS GUT, AND AS A
RESULT, DEVON'S STILL IN,

846
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,862
DR. MIKE ISN'T.

847
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,280
DR. MIKE, COME ON OUT!

848
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:54,827
<i>( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
WOW.

849
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,204
LOOK AT THE LOVE!

850
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,581
HOW YOU DOING?

851
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,041

852
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:01,876
I'M GOOD.

853
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,252

PRETTY GOOD.

854
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,920
>> IT'S AMAZING, GUYS.

855
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:05,588
IT'S AMAZING.

856
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,505
LOOK AT THIS.

857
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,257
THIS IS AWESOME!

858
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,925
<i>( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO, HERE'S

859
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,177
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

860
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,557
GIVEN HOW TIGHT YOU GUYS WERE,
WHEN YOU SAW THAT VOTE, WERE YOU

861
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,186
SHOCKED OR DID IT GO THROUGH
YOUR MIND THAT IT COULD HAPPEN?

862
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,438
>> THESE GUYS ARE ALL GREAT
PLAYERS.

863
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,231
AND I KNEW THIS COULD HAPPEN.

864
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,733
BUT I WAS HOPING IT WOULDN'T.

865
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,943
I WAS, LIKE, HOLDING MY CARDS,
ONE MORE VOTE.

866
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,111
I ALMOST MADE IT.

867
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,572
>> Jeff: DID YOU DEBATE DOING
THE SAME THING TO DEVON?

868
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,615
>> OH, I WAS PLANNING TO.

869
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,783
I TOLD-- I TOLD RYAN I WAS
VOTING FOR DEVON TONIGHT.

870
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,579
AND I JUST --
>> SO THAT-- OKAY, THAT'S THE

871
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,747
DIFFERENCE RIGHT THERE.

872
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,209
DEVON HAS-- WE ALWAYS SAY TO
PEOPLE BEFORE-- BEFORE THE GAME

873
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,086
STARTS, "PLAY AS THOUGH YOU'RE
PLAYING FOR THE SECOND TIME,"

874
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,214
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE BIG
MOVES.

875
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:48,714
DEVON MADE THE BIG MOVE PUP
DIDN'T.

876
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,089
YOU'RE HERE.

877
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,633
HE'S STILL IN.

878
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,927
>> THANKS, JEFF.

879
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,761
THANKS.

880
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,929
SHOULD I THROW THE CHECK IN THE
FIRE?

881
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,764
>> Jeff: ONE OTHER-- ONE OTHER
YE, JUST FROM A DREAM POINT OF

882
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:01,101
VIEW, YOU TALKED ABOUT-- YOUR
WIFE EVEN SAID IT-- IT'S THE

883
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,520
ONLY SELFISH THING YOU'VE DONE
IN YOUR LIFE.

884
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,146
DID IT FULFILL?

885
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,232
WHY WAS THIS THE DREAM?

886
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:11,779
>> I MEAN, YOU'RE AS A KID, YOU
GROW UP AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A

887
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:12,738
FAMILY AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A
WIFE AND KIDS AND I GOT IT, AND

888
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,739
IT'S AMAZING.

889
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,326
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WANT TO
WIN "SURVIVOR."

890
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,994
I WANT TO PLAY "SURVIVOR."

37 DAYS!

894

AND THIS WAS THE FIRST VOTE THAT
I WAS, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, I

00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,756
GOT TO LOOK ONE MORE VOTE AHEAD,
SET UP MY FINAL THREE SO I CAN

921
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,204
I'M STILL SITTING HERE ALIVE.

922
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,000
SO I POTENTIALLY DID MAKE A
MILLION-DOLLAR MOVE RIGHT THERE.

923
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,712
>> "SURVIVOR" ENCYCLOPEDIA.

TRIBA>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS AMAZI

930
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,729
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHERE IT
GETS TRICKY.

931
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:13,108
I HAVE NO MORE BEN BOMBS TO DROP
IN ON TRIBAL.

932
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,860
THERE AIN'T NO MORE IDOLS IN THE
GAME.

933
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:19,239
SO THE FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST MOMENT OF

934
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,368
MY LIFE, AND I HAVE TO WIN IT
BECAUSE AIN'T NONE OF THEM GOING

935
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,494
TO TAKE ME TO THE END.

936
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:26,747
THE ONLY WAY I'M GETTING TO THE
END IS IF I TAKE MYSELF.

937
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,956
>> DAMN YOU, BEN!

938
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,417
>> I HAVE TO WIN!

939
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,919
>> I HAVE TO WIN IMMUNITY
TOMORROW.

940
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,587
I HAVE NO PROTECTION NOW.

941
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,422
I HAVE NO ALLIANCE.

942
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,384
BUT I DO HAVE MY WIFE AND MY
KID.

943
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,928
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT,
AND THAT'S MY DRIVING FORCE.

944
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,389
SO IT'S "GO" TIME.

945
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,432
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT EVERYTHING
I GOT.

946
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,934
Y'ALL, I'M GOING TO GO GET
WATER.

00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:51,438

00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,731
>> I WONDER WHAT THE TWIST IS.

951
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,109
>> THE TWIST IS WE NEED TO BEAT
BEN TOMORROW, I FEEL LIKE.

952
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,904
>> THE EENL WAY WE HAVE A SHOT
IS IF WE BEAT HIM AT IMMUNITY.

953
00:44:58,987 --> 00:44:59,738
>> EXACTLY.

954
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,408
>> THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHERE
WE'RE AT.

955
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:07,454
>> I CAN'T GET RID OF BEN, AND
IT'S DRIVING ME ABSOLUTELY

BANANAS.

957
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:09,915
BUT THE REALITY IS, EVEN THOUGH
I FEEL LIKE CAN BEAT BEN, I

958
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,959
DON'T WANT TO BRING HIM TO THE
FINAL THREE.

959
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,628
SO AS LONG AS ONE OF US WINS
IMMUNITY, HE WILL BE VOTED OUT

960
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,671
OF THE GAME.

961
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,132
THEN AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE TWIST IS, RIGHT?

962
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,008
SO THE TWIST COULD TOTALLY FOIL
THOSE PLANS.

963
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,678
I HAVE NO IDEA.

964
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,055
I'VE COME TO DECIDE THAT YOU
CAN'T EXPECT ANYTHING IN

965
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,225
"SURVIVOR" BECAUSE NO MATTER
WHAT YOU EXPECT, SOMETHING ELSE

966
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:34,022
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

967
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:54,168
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

968
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,047
ALL RIGHT.

969
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,007
FINAL FOUR.

970
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,969
SHALL WE GET TO YOUR FINAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

971
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:09,224
FIRST THINGS FIRST, CHRISSY, FOR
THE THIRD TIME, I HAVE TO TAKE

972
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:09,933
IT BACK.

973
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:17,983
>> I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN SOON.

974
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:22,863
>> Jeff: FOR THE LAST TIME,
IMMUNITY IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

975
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,825
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO STACK LETTER BLOCKS ON

976
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,370
A VERY WOBBLY PLATFORM.

977
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:35,876
FIRST PERSON TO SPELL "HEROES,
HEALERS, HUSTLERS," WINS

978
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:40,172
IMMUNITY AND WITH THIS NECKLACE,
GUARANTEES THEMSELVES A SPOT IN

979
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:43,383

YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO PLEAD

YOU DESERVE THE TITLE OF "SOLE

LOSERS, TONIGHT, SOMEBODY WILL
BECOME THE EIGHTH AND FINAL

983
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,230
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

984
00:46:56,313 --> 00:47:01,360
AND AS I MENTIONED, LAST NIGHT
AT TRIBAL, THERE IS A TWIST.

985
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:08,575
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S CHALLENGE
ALSO RECEIVES THE FINAL SECRET

986
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,538
ADVANTAGE OF THE GAME.

987
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,081
STAKES DON'T GET ANY BIGGER.

988
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:25,551
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS, AND WE'LL
GET STARTED.

989
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,428
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

990
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,721
BIG STAKES.

991
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,140
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

992
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,102
SURVIVORS READY?

993
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:39,940
GO!

994
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,776
FIRST IT'S HOME BLOCKS CAN YOU
CARRY OUT?

995
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:46,113
THEN YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK THIS
STRUCTURE WITH YOUR FOOT, AND

996
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,740
THEN IT GETS WOBBLY, AND THAT'S
WHERE THE WORK STARTS.

997
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:52,953
YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THESE
LETTERS WITHOUT THEM DROPPING.

998
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,788
RYAN OFF TO A FAST START.

999
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,748
BEN NOW WORKING ON TWO LETTERS.

1000
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,959
CHRISSY HAS LETTERS QUICKLY.

1001
00:47:59,042 --> 00:47:59,501
CHRISSY DROPS.

1002
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,711
SHE'S GOT TO GO BACK.

1003
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:04,965
ONCE YOU DROP, YOU'VE GOT TO
LOCK YOUR STRUCTURE IN, PICK UP

1004
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,384
YOUR BLOCKS, AND GO BACK AND
START AGAIN.

1005
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:11,138
BUT ANY BLOCKS THAT REMAIN ARE
STILL GOOD.

1006
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,975
RYAN LOCKING OUT, LOCKING OUT IS
A BIG PART OF THIS CHALLENGE.

1007
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:19,980
WHEN YOU LOCK YOUR STRUCTURE
BACK IN, THAT IS OFTEN WHERE YOU

1008
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:20,981
DROP BLOCKS.

1009
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,482
RYAN NOW WITH THE EARLY LEAD.

1010
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:27,154
HE'S GOING TO HEAD BACK.

1011
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,196
AND DEVON DROPS.

1012
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,449
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

1013
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:34,620
YOU HAVE TO BE GENTLE WHEN YOU
LOCK THIS BACK IN.

1014
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,372
YOU'VE GOT ADRENALINE PUMPING
THROUGH YOUR BODY, BUT YOU'VE

1015
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,499
GOT TO REMAIN CALM.

1016
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,835
THIS IS YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

1017
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:45,005
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

1018
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,008
RYAN NOW WITH THE EARLY LEAD.

1019
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,177
HE'S GOT "HEROES" SPELLED.

1020
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,930
DEVON IS STARTING OVER.

1021
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,642
CHRISSY STILL WORKING ON
"HEROES."

1022
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,686
BEN NOW HAS HIS FIRST WORD
SPELLED.

1023
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:07,569
CAN HE LOCK IN WITH THE TOUCH
REQUIRED THAT NOTHING WILL FALL?

1024
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,528
AND HE DOES.

1025
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,864
BEN NOW HEADING BACK FOR MORE
LETTERS.

1026
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:14,201
WE ARE NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW
WITH RYAN AND BEN.

1027
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:18,914
RYAN BEGINS WORKING ON
"HEALERS," THE SECOND WORD.

1028
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,166
DEVON BACK ON "HEROES."

1029
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:21,541
DEVON DROPS AGAIN.

1030
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,919
CHRISSY DROPS.

1031
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:28,006
CHRISSY STRUGGLING FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN A LONG TIME IN A

1032
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:28,757
CHALLENGE.

1033
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,633
RIGHT NOW IT IS NOT LOOKING
GOOD.

1034
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,176
IT IS NOW BEN WORKING ON HIS
SECOND WORD.

1035
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:36,390
BEN REALLY TAKING HIS TIME, NOT
PANICKING AT ALL.

1036
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,559
RYAN'S GOT "HEALERS" COMPLETED
NOW.

1037
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,437
RYAN IS TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY
THERE, AND STARTS HIS WAY BACK.

1038
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,272
BEN RIGHT ON HIS TAIL.

1039
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,067
RYAN AT THE CRITICAL POINT.

1040
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,111
AND HE DROPS THREE.

1041
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,613
RYAN HAS TO GO BACK.

1042
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,616
AND THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR BEN
NOW!

1043
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,577
HE'S NOW GOING TO TRY TO LOCK
IN.

1044
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,204
IT IS NOW BEN IN THE LEAD.

1045
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:03,083
HE HAS NOBODY EVEN CLOSE TO HIM.

1046
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:09,464
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE, A LINE.

1047
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,884
A GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE FINAL
THREE.

1048
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,721
THIS IS ALL ALL-IN MOVE BY BEN
RIGHT NOW.

1049
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,432
NO SECRET, BEN HAS BEEN THE
TARGET, TRYING TO GET HIM OUT,

1050
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,433
UNABLE TO DO IT.

1051
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,768
AND HERE WE ARE IN THE FINAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1052
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:28,108
BEN JUST A FEW LETTERS AWAY FROM
WINNING HIS WAY TO THE END.

1053
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,235
BEN PLACES ANOTHER LETTER.

1054
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,487
BEN HAS FOUR LETTERS LEFT.

1055
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,158
IF HE'S RIGHT, THIS WOULD SECURE
BEN A SPOT IN THE FINAL TRIBAL

1056
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:36,783
COUNCIL.

1057
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,243
BEN PLACES HIS LAST LETTER.

1058
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:42,456
HE'S STILL GOT TO GET THIS
LOCKED IN AND BE RIGHT.

1059
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,792
BEN LOOKING FOR THAT LAST TOUCH.

1060
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:52,466
TO LOCK IN.

1061
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:57,971
BEN THINKS HE HAS IT.

1062
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,807
>> Jeff: NO, SOMETHING IS NOT
RIGHT!

1063
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,683
WHAT'S WRONG?

1064
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,186
BEN'S GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE
DID WRONG.

1065
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,854
THE DOOR IS STILL OPEN!

1066
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,189
DEVON NOW PICKING UP THE PACE!

1067
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,983
RYAN SEES THE OPPORTUNITY.

1068
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,318
CHRISSY NOT GIVING UP.

1069
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,112
NOW BEN IS PANICKING.

1070
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,615
RACING TO GET BACK OUT THERE,
AND HE LOSES BLOCKS.

1071
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,201
BEN LOSES ALMOST EVERYTHING!

1072
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,327
DISASTER FOR BEN.

1073
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:25,332
HE'S GOT TO HEAD BACK AND REDO
ALL THE WORK HE JUST LOST.

1074
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:32,631
RYAN NOW WITH A COMFORTABLE
LEAD, AND HE CAN NOW SLOW DOWN.

1075
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:36,301
AND RYAN HAAS LOST NEARLY
EVERYTHING.

1076
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:40,013
AND CHRISSY LOSES EVERYTHING.

1077
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,014
AND DEVON DROPS.

1078
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,516
HE'S GOT TO GO BACK.

1079
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,016
WOW!

1080
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,976

00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:49,731
THE DOOR IS WYATT OPEN AGAIN IN
THIS CHALLENGE.

1082
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,526
BEN IS BACK IN THE LEAD NOW.

1083
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,862
BEN QUICKLY HAS PUT "HEROES"
BACK TOGETHER.

1084
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,989
HE'S NOW GOING TO TRY TO LOCK
IN.

1085
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:02,327
AND BEN ONCE AGAIN MOVES TOO
FAST AND LOSES ABSOLUTELY

1086
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,537
EVERYTHING!

1087
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,249
THE LESSON IN THIS CHALLENGE IS
STARING YOU IN THE FACE: YOU

1088
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:13,380
NEVER GIVE UP BECAUSE ALL IT
TAKES IS ONE PERSON TO DROP ONE

1089
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:18,218

RYAN DROPS MORE.

1096
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,036
AND MORE.

1097
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,289
CHRISSY WORKING ON "HUSTLERS."

1098
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:51,710
BEN CLOSING THE GAB RIGHT NOW AS
HE FINISHES "HEALERS."

1099
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,422
HE'S NOW TRYING TO LOCK IN
WITHOUT DROPPING ANY BLOCKS.

1100
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,426
BEN RACES BACK, AND HE'S GOING
TO GRAB ALL THE BLOCKS FOR HIS

1101
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,468
LAST WORD ONCE AGAIN.

1102
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,763
CHRISSY PLACES ANOTHER LETTER IN
"HUSTLERS."

1103
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:04,264
IT'S CHRISSY IN THE LEAD.

00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:11,104
ALL THE LETTERS HE NEEDS TO WIN
THIS CHALLENGE IN HIS ARMS IF HE

00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:17,277
CAN FINALLY COMPLETE THE
CHALLENGE.

1107
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,406
BEN PLACES HIS FIRST, CHRISSY
PLACES ANOTHER BLOCK.

1108
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,326
CHRISSY IS FOUR BLOCKS AWAY FROM
FINISHING THIS CHALLENGE, BUT

1109
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:30,248
THE BLOCK BLOCKS ARE A LONG WAYS
BEN HAS ALL OF HIS WITH HIM.

1110

1187
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,371
>> Jeff: YOUR MOM'S ROCKING
IT.

1188
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:39,205
SHE'S READY TO ROCK IT.

1189
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,457
AND I GOTTA ASK-- POP UP,
QLIEWRS NAME?

1190
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,667
>> I'M GRANT.

1191
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,128
>> Jeff: BECAUSE I WAS
WATCHING YOU.

1192
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,045
ARE YOU A BEN FAN?

1193
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:46,713
>> YES.

1194
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,425
>> Jeff: THE UPSIDE DOWN "U."

1195
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,719
IT'S GOING TO HAUNT HIM FOREVER,
THAT "U."

1196
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,680
CHRISSY IS IN THE FINAL THREE,
AND THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL

1197
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:56,347
JOIN HER?

1198
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,557
THERE ARE NO MORE CHALLENGES.

1199
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,225
THERE ARE NO MORE IDOLS.

1200
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,561
BUT THERE IS ONE TWIST LEFT, AND
CHRISSYS THAT.

1201
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,731
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS IT?

1202
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,524

1203

BUT UNTIL JEFF SNUFFS MY TORCH,
THERE MIGHT BE OPTIONS.

1234
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:59,512
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT I COULD
STAY IN THIS GAME AND GO TO THE

1235
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:00,346
END WITH YOU?

1236
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,848
>> UM--
>> I'D LOVE TO SIT NEXT TO YOU.

1237
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:02,932

1238
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,310
>> AND I RESPECT IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO SIT NEXT TO ME.

1239
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:10,231
>> OKAY, SO THIS IS, ACTUALLY,
HOW I WILL RESPOND TO YOU.

1240
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:16,029
AND THAT IS BY SAYING I WILL GO
INTO TRIBAL TONIGHT AND HEAR YOU

1241
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,739
OUT.

1242
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:21,409
AND YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT.

1243
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,370
BEN APPROACHED ME TO SEE IF I
WOULD CONSIDER TAKING HIM TO THE

1244
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,538
FINAL THREE.

1245
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:28,207
NOW, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY
ABSOLUTELY NOT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T

1246
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,667
WANT TO SHUT HIM OUT.

1247
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,588
SO I TOLD BEN, ", YOU KNOW,
WHAT, I'M WILLING TO THINK ABOUT

1248
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,380
IT."

1249
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:34,839
BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S
HAPPENING.

1250
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,382
BEN NEEDS TO GO.

1251
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,550
ALL RIGHT, YOU.

1252
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:40,553
BUT BEFORE I CAN THINK MUCH
FURTHER ABOUT, THAT I NEED TO

1253
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:49,062
GET AWAY PRIVATELY TO READ MY
SECRET ADVANTAGE.

1254
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,522
OKAY, SECRET ADVANTAGE.

1255
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,148
"CONGRATULATIONS.

1256
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:57,028
YOU ARE IN THE FINAL THREE.

1257
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:01,240
YOU HAVE ALSO WON AN ADVANTAGE
IN THE FORM OF INFORMATION.

1258
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,577
THIS IS THE LAST AND PERHAPS
BIGGEST SECRET OF THE GAME, AND

1259
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,580
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS.

1260
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:12,460
TONIGHT, YOU ARE IN CHARGE AND
WILL CAST THE ONLY VOTE.

1261
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:18,257
YOU WILL CHOOSE ONE PERSON-TO-TO
SIT--" UUUH!

1262
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,718
"YOU WILL CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO
SIT NEXT TO YOU AT THE FINAL

REMAINING PLAYERS TO AROUND

1264
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:29,143
THEIR WAY TO THE END BY BATTLING
IT OUT IN A FIRE-MAKING

1265
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:29,936
CHALLENGE.

1266
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:30,937
THE WINNER SECURES THE FINAL
SEAT.

1267
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:35,817
THE LOSER BECOMES THE EIGHTH
MEMBER OF THE JURY.

1268
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,984
JURY."

1269
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,613
THIS IS A HUGE TWIST IN THE
GAME, AND IT MEANS THE DOOR IS

1270
01:01:40,696 --> 01:01:41,823
OPEN FOR BEN TO POTENTIALLY COME
TO THE FINAL THREE.

1271
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,074
NOT GOOD.

1272
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,952
BUT RIGHT NOW, I HAVE THE POWER
BECAUSE I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO

1273
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,288
KNOWS ABOUT THE FIRE-MAKING
CHALLENGE.

1274
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,417
SO MY DECISION IS SIMPLY BASED
ON WHO CAN BEAT BEN.

1275
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,086
I'VE GOT RYAN AND I'VE GOT
DEVON.

1276
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,754
RYAN PROBABLY NEVER MADE A FIRE
IN HIS LIFE.

1277
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:01,968
SO THE ONLY WAY TO SEND BEN HOME
IS TO HAVE HIM MAKE FIRE AGAINST

1278
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,136
DEVON.

1279
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,431
NOW, I NEED TO TELL DEVON SO
THAT HE HAS TIME TO PRACTICE.

1280
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,975
LIKE, WHATEVER HE NEEDS TO DO TO
GET READY FOR THIS CHALLENGE, I

1281
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:14,439
WANT DEVON TO DO.

1282
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,983
"AND YOU'LL CHOOSE THE PERSON TO
SIT NEXT TO YOU."

1283
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,234
WOW.

1284
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:22,321
>> IF I PICK YOU TO SIT NEXT TO
ME, THEN RYAN HAS TO MAKE FIRE

1285
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,239
WITH BEN.

1286
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,158
IF I PICK RYAN, YOU WILL NEED TO
MAKE FIRE.

1287
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,492
>> SO IT'S UP TO ME.

1288
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,535
IT WAS SHOCKING TO ME.

1289
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,661
I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS TWIST.

1290
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:30,872
IMMEDIATELY, I KNOW SHE'S
SHOWING ME THIS BECAUSE SHE

1291
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:34,625
THINKS I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN
BEAT BEN.

1292
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:35,835
I'M EXCITED, MAN.

1293
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,044
I'M PUMPED.

1294
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,840
IT'S GOING TO GIVE ME THAT EXACT
UMPH AT THE END OF MY GAME TO

1295
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,342
SHOW THE JURY THEY DESERVE THE
MILLION DOLLARS, THAT I'M ONE

1296
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,302
WHO TOOK DOWN BEN.

1297
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:48,681
>> I DON'T WANT BEN TO KNOW HE
HAS A CHANCE.

1298
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:49,348
THIS IS YOUR DAY.

1299
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:53,227
>> OKAY, I CAN DO THIS.

1300
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:57,899
>> HOW FUN IS THIS TWIST GOING
TO BE,O A SCALE OF 1-10,

1301
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:58,191
CHRISSY?

1302
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:58,566
>> 0.

1303
01:02:58,649 --> 01:02:59,609
>> WHAT IS IT?

1304
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:03,404
>> DEVON AND BEN ARE GOING TO
HAVE A FIRE-MAKING?

1305
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,238
>> WHY?

1306
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:07,074
>> SHE BRINGS ONE PERSON WITH
HER.

1307
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,993
SHE'S BRINGING YOU.

1308
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,411
>> OH, MY GOD, THANK YOU.

1309
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,998
>> THE OTHER TWO MUST BATTLE IT
OUT AND MAKE FIRE.

1310
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:17,210
THE ONLY WAY TO GET BEN OUT IS
FOR DEVON TO MAKE FIRE AND BEAT

1311
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:17,752
HIM.

1312
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:18,211
>> I COULDN'T BEAT HIM.

1313
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:18,628
>> I KNOW.

1314
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,838
>> OH, MY GOSH!

1315
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,382
DEVON'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
FIRE AGAINST BEN AND CHRISSY

1316
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,052
SAYS THAT "YOU'RE GOING WITH ME
TO THE FINAL THREE."

1317
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,261
I AM FLOORED.

1318
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:33,392
WHO KNEW THAT MY INABILITY TO
MAKE FIRE WOULD SAVE ME ON DAY

1319
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:33,643
38.

1320
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:34,894
INEIC.

1321
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:39,607
>> HE WILL BE THE ONE PERSON WHO
CAN FINALLY GET HIM OUT OF THIS

1322
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,399
GAME.

1323
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,859
GO GET FLINT RIGHT NOW AND
PRACTICE.

1324
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:45,571
>> THROUGHOUT THIS GAME, I HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO START FIRE WITH

1325
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,697
FLINT.

1326
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:56,791
I'VE DONE IT PLENTY OF MORNINGS,
BUT I NEED TO PRACTICE.

1327
01:03:56,874 --> 01:04:06,717
I'VE DONE IT PLENTY OF MORNINGS,
BUT I NEED TO PRACTICE.

1328
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:09,971
>> SO I'M STRIKE THE FLINT, AND
ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT BREAKSES.

1329
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:13,307
I'M THINKING THIS PROBABLY MEANT
TO BE.

1330
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,602
THIS FLINT JUST BROKE BECAUSE
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO WASTE MY

1331
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,770
ENERGY.

1332
01:04:17,853 --> 01:04:20,773
I NEED TO GO INTO THIS TRIBAL
COUNCIL CALM, COOL, AND I NEED

1333
01:04:20,856 --> 01:04:23,067
TO BELIEVE IN MYSELF BECAUSE I
DOMENT THE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

1334
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:28,781
MY LIFE, FOR MY FAMILY'S LIFE,
FOR EVERYONE I CARE ABOUT.

1335
01:04:28,864 --> 01:04:30,658
TONIGHT COULD CHANGE THE REST OF
MY LIFE.

1336
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:31,784
IT ALL LIES ON ME.

1337
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:35,997
IT'S CRAZY.

1338
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,292
>> BEN HAS NO IDEA THAT HE WILL
BE GOING TO A FIRE-MAKING

1339
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,168
CHALLENGE TONIGHT.

1340
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:45,298
THIS GAME'S IN DEVON'S HANDS,
AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT HE CAN DO

1341
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:45,798
IT.

1342
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:46,632
BUT I AM VERY NERVOUS.

1343
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,926
EITHER ONE OF THOSE GUYS COULD
WIN IT.

1344
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:52,763
SO ONCE AGAIN, IT IS GOING TO BE
A VERY INTERESTING TRIBAL

1345
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:59,645
TONIGHT, AND WE WILL NOT HAVE
ANSWERS UNTIL THE BITTER END.

MILLION-DOLLAR FIRE-MAKING

POPULAR GUYS, DEVON AND BEN.

01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,458
HE'S GOT NO TIME TO PREPARE.

1353
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,293
HE THINKS IT'S GAME OVER.

1354
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,338
WHICH IS WHY WE SAY ALL THE TIME
ON THE SHOW YOU NEVER GIVE UP.

1355
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,505
NEVER GIVE UP!

1356
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,884
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS
COMING AROUND THE CORNER.

1357
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,011
WE ARE LIVE IN LOS ANGELES!

DR. MIKE VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1367
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:19,183
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S START WITH
TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1368
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:23,479
CHRISSY, YOU WIN YOUR FOURTH
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, TYING THE

1369
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:27,400
RECORD FOR THE MOST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WINS BY A WOMAN.

1370
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,943
NICELY DONE.

1371
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,528
SO WHAT'S THE FEELING?

1372
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:34,615
WHEN YOU JUST TAKE IN THAT
MOMENT, KNOWING YOU HAVE SECURED

1373
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,076
YOURSELF A SPOT AT THE FINAL
TRIBAL?

1374
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,579
>> FOR ME, THE FOURTH WIN WAS
INCREDIBLE KNOWING I WAS GOING

1375
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,580
TO THE FINAL THREE.

1376
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,083
AND THAT WAS A SUPER-HARD
CHALLENGE.

1377
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,419
SO IT WAS JUST A GREAT FEELING
ALL AROUND.

1378
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,422
>> Jeff: RYAN, IT WAS ONE OF
THE MOST ELECTRIC CHALLENGES

1379
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,297
WE'VE EVER HAD.

1380
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,133
AND YOU HAD THE EARLY LEAD.

1381
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,300
>> YEAH, I DID.

1382
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:57,263
YOU KNOW, I'M A HUGE FAN, AND
WEARINWEARING THAT NECKLACE,

1383
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,266
ESPECIALLY ON DAY 38, IS
SOMETHING THAT YOU DREAM ABOUT.

1384
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:03,602
IT WAS TOUGH, AND I MAY REPLAY
THAT CHALLENGE FOR A LONG TIME.

1385
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:07,606
>> Jeff: BEN, YOU HAD MORE
SHOTS ON GOAL THAN ANYBODY.

1386
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,443
AND YOU COULD NOT CLOSE THE
DEAL.

1387
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:16,073
>> AN UPSIDE DOWN "U" WILL
FOREVER HAUNT ME, BECAUSE THAT

1388
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,284
WAS A MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE
RIGHT THERE.

1389
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,287
YOU KNOW, I KNOW I'M ON THE
BOTTOM.

1390
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,580
IT'S CLEAR AND EVIDENT.

1391
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:26,625
SO I HATE TO SAY IT IS WHAT IT
IS, BUT IF I GET SNUFFED

1392
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,462
TONIGHT, I DID MY BEST, AND I'M
PROUD OF MY GAME.

1393
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,422
AND I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.

1394
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:35,301
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, ALONG WITH
WINNING TODAY'S IMMUNITY

1395
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,138
CHALLENGE, YOU ALSO WON THE LAST
SECRET ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME.

1396
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:43,184
DID YOU KEEP IT A SECRET OR DID
YOU SHARE IT WITH ANYBODY?

1397
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,227
>> I DID SHARE IT.

1398
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,855
BUT NOT WITH EVERYONE.

1399
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,815
>> Jeff: BEN, YOU'RE LOOKING
AROUND NOW.

1400
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,485
>> YEAH, I'M WONDERING WHO SHE
SHARED IT WITH, BECAUSE IT

1401
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,110
WASN'T ME.

1402
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,445
>> SHE SHARED IT WITH ME.

1403
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:55,446
>> SAME.

1404
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:56,989
>> THAT MAKES SENSE, THOUGH.

1405
01:07:57,072 --> 01:07:59,366
I MEAN, I GET THAT.

1406
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,494
I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT IT IS
NOW.

1407
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,413
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, DO YOU WANT
TO CATCH THE JURY UP AND BEN ON

1408
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,831
WHAT IT SAYS?

1409
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,041
>> SURE.

1410
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:09,919
>> "CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE
WON AN ADVANTAGE IN THE FORM OF

1411
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,128
INFORMATION.

1412
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:14,340
TONIGHT, YOU WILL CHOOSE ONE
PERSON TO SIT NEXT TO YOU AT THE

1413
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:18,344
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL, FORCING
THE TWO REMAINING PLAYERS TO

1414
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:24,350
EARN THEIR WAY TO THE END BY
BATTLING IT OUT IN A FIRE-MAKING

1415
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:28,395
CHALLENGE."

1416
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,814
>> WOW.

1417
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:33,192
>> Jeff: SO, CHRISSY, I'M
GUESSING YOU THOUGHT A LOT THIS

1418
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,528
AFTERNOON, GIVEN THAT YOU SHARED
IT WITH RYAN AND DEVON.

1419
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:38,531
>> WELL, LET ME SAY ONE THING
FIRST.

1420
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,366
FOR SOME OF US TO BE IN CHARGE
OF THEIR OWN FATE, I SEE THE

1421
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,367
BEAUTY IN THAT.

1422
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:45,830
THAT SAID, I HOPE THAT IT ENDS
IN A CERTAIN WAY.

1423
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,415
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, CHRISSY,
YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE ONE

1424
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:53,712
PERSON THAT YOU CAN GUARANTEE IS
SITTING NEXT TO YOU, AND YOU'RE

1425
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,215
SIMULTANEOUSLY LEAVING THE OTHER
TWO TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES.

1426
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,175
THAT THIRD SPOT WILL BE EARNED.

1427
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,094
IT WON'T BE JUST GIVEN.

1428
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:00,886
HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION?

1429
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:01,929
>> I HAVE.

1430
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:06,600
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET US
KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

1431
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:13,941
>> I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE RYAN TO
THE FINAL THREE.

1432
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:16,569
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO, RYAN,
FIRST OF ALL, HOW DOES THAT FEEL

1433
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,820
TO HEAR THAT?

1434
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:20,739
>> IT'S JUST A REALLY GOOD
FEELING.

1435
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:21,699
I THANK CHRISSY.

1436
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,742
WE'VE BEEN IN LOCKSTEP A LOT OF
WAY HERE.

1437
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,579
AND I GET A CHANCE TO PLEAD MY
CASE TO THE JURY.

1438
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:27,788
IT FEELS INCREDIBLE.

1439
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,456
>> Jeff: DEVON, HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL THAT YOU WILL HAVE

1440
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,418
TO EARN YOUR WAY TO THE FINAL
THREE.

1441
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,212
>> I LOVE THE FEELING.

1442
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:39,633
THIS IS MY CHANCE TO PUT MY FATE
IN MY OWN HANDS.

1443
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:40,676
IT FEELS GREAT.

1444
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,054
>> Jeff: AND, BEN, YOUR KNEE
IS LITERALLY BOUNCING.

1445
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,639
>> THIS IS AWESOME.

1446
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,725
YOU KNOW, I BLEW IT TODAY.

1447
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:50,644
AND THAT'S ALL ME.

1448
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,146
BUT I GET A SECOND CHANCE.

1449
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,607
>> Jeff: LITERALLY, A LAST
GASP.

1450
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,067
>> I'M READY TO GO MAKE SOME
FIRE.

1451
01:09:57,151 --> 01:10:00,571
AND I'M GOING TO DO MY BEST, AND
WE'RE GOING TO COMPETE, TWO

1452
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:02,656
WARRIORS BATTLING IT OUT TRYING
TO MAKE A FIRE.

1453
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,491
>> MAY THE BOAST MAN WIN.

1454
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,452
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO HERE'S
HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.

1455
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:10,289
38 DAYS IN, YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW
TO MAKE FIRE.

1456
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:14,501
AND IF YOU CAN, IT COULD BE
WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS.

1457
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,630
I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO THINK

1458
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:18,714
STARTED.

1459
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:29,975
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, THERE IS
ONE SEAT LEFT AT THE FINAL

1460
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,060
THREE.

1461
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:33,646
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHOSE BUTT
WILL BE SITTING IN IT.

1462
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:37,650
BEN AND DEVON, TAKE YOUR SPOTS
AT THE FIRE-MAKING STATION.

1463
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:40,486
WE HAVE CHRISY AND RYAN ALREADY
IN THE FINAL THREE.

1464
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:44,490
FIRST TIME EVER THE FINAL SPOT
WILL BE EARNED BY A FIRE-MAKING

1465
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:45,324
SHOWDOWN.

1466
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,118
YOU EACH HAVE THE EXACT SAME
SUPPLIES.

1467
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,496
YOUR JOB IS TO BUILD A FIRE THAT
IS HIGH ENOUGH AND HOT ENOUGH TO

1468
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,915
BURN THROUGH THAT CORD.

1469
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:56,168
FIRST PERSON THAT BURNS THROUGH
THEIR CORD, THAT FLAG RAISES,

1470
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:58,671
YOU ARE SITTING AT THE FINAL
THREE.

1471
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,715
LOSER BECOMES THE EIGHTH AND
FINAL MEMBER OF THE JURY, AND

1472
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:04,218
YOU WILL BE SITTING OVER THERE.

1473
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:04,593
YOU GUYS BOTH READY?

1474
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:05,594
>> YES, SIR.

1475
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:06,387
>> Jeff: GOOD LUCK.

1476
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:10,224
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

1477
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:17,189
THIS COULD GO VERY FAST.

1478
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,363
>> Jeff: THIS IS NOT LIKE
MAKING FIRE BACK AT CAMP WHERE

1479
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,699
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF PRESSURE.

1480
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:31,328
THIS IS POTENTIALLY A
MILLION-DOLLAR CHALLENGE.

1481
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,415
SIDE BY SIDE, BOTH GUYS WITH THE
SAME PROCESS.

1482
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:39,586
DEVON GOING TO GO FOR IT FIRST,
TRYING TO GET A SPARK, TRYING TO

1483
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,132
GET THAT MAGNESIUM TO GO.

1484
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:49,263
BEN GOING TO JOIN HIM, BOTH
SPARKING THEIR FLINT.

1485
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:53,392
BEN HAS A LITTLE SOMETHING BUT
IT GOES OUT.

1486
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:58,564
DEVON NOW SCRAPING MORE
MAGNESIUM.

1487
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:02,359
BEN LOOK FOR A SPARK TO GET
SOMETHING TO LIGHT.

1488
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:06,196
DEVON TAKING A MORE METHODICAL
APPROACH WITH MAGNESIUM, TRYING

1489
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,618
TO BUILD A LITTLE PILE OF IT,
HOPING THAT WILL IGNITE.

1490
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:12,411
DEVON SPARK BIG.

1491
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:16,165
TRYING TO GET IT GOING.

1492
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,420
>> DEVON'S GOT ONE.

1493
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:28,093
>> Jeff: DEVON'S GOT A LITTLE
SOMETHING, BUT IT GOES OUT.

1494
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:33,098
BEN CONTINUES TO STRIKE THE
KNIFE, AND HE'S GOT A LITTLE

1495
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,767
SOMETHING GOING.

1496
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,060
CAN HE KEEP IT GOING?

1497
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:41,440
BENBEN HAS THE FIRST FLAME, BUT
THAT'S GOING TO GO OUT QUICKLY.

1498
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:46,779
HEY HE'S TO GET STICKS ON IT AND
GET SOMETHING TO TAKE.

1499
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,948
BEN HAS MORE FLAME, HAS SOME
STICKS ON THERE.

1500
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,617
CAN HE KEEP IT GOING?

1501
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,702
DEVON STRIKING FASTER NOW.

1502
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,790
WORKING HARD TRYING TO GET
SOMETHING GOING.

1503
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:01,835
FIRE STARTING TO BURN FOR BEN.

1504
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:02,795
>> DEVON, YOU'RE STILL IN IT.

1505
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,631
>> Jeff: REACTIONS FROM CHRISY
AND RYAN NOW.

1506
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:09,301
EVERYBODY'S BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT
WHAT THEY WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN.

1507
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:12,137
BEN IS THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS
BEN TO WIN.

1508
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:16,517
EVERYBODY ELSE PULLING FOR
DEVON.

1509
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,312
BEN NOW PULLING OUT THE BIGGER
PIECES.

1510
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:26,610
AND THAT'S GOING TO HELP LOCK
THAT FIRE IN.

1511
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:28,987
DEVON CONTINUE TO STRIKE.

1512
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:34,451
FASTER AND FASTER, TRYING TO GET
SOMETHING GOING.

1513
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:37,996
BEN'S FLAME IS BURNING HIGH NOW,
AND IT'S STARTING TO HIT THAT

1514
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:38,622
CORD.

1515
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:43,043

01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:51,635

1519
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:53,720
YES!

1520
01:13:53,804 --> 01:14:00,018
BEN WINS THE FIRE SHOWDOWN AND
EARNS THE FINAL SEAT AT TRIBAL

1521
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,688

01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:35,387

01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:03,081
CHRISSY, BEN, RYAN.

1535
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:07,878
TOMORROW, THE POWER IN THE GAME
SHIFTS TO THE JURY.

1536
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:12,382
EIGHT PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD A HAND
IN VOTING OUT OF THE GAME WILL

1537
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:15,761
NOW DECIDE WHICH ONE OF YOU THEY

TOMORROW.

1543
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,147
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, GOOD NIGHT.

1544
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,650
>> OH, MAN, IT'S A BUMMER TO GO
HOME AT THIS POINT.

1545
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:33,111
ONE DAY SHORT, MAKING FINAL
THREE.

1546
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:33,946
BUT, CONGRATS TO BEN.

1547
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,781
HE KILLED IT IN THAT FIRE
CHALLENGE.

1548
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,742
EVEN THOUGH I LOST, AT LEAST MY
FATE LIED IN MY HANDS, AND I

1549
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:39,952
WENT OUT WITH A BIG BANG.

1550
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:44,248
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME,
I'M A STRONGER MAN, AND I JUST

1551
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:47,125
FEEL BLESSED TO HAVE HAD THIS
EXPERIENCE.

1552
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:52,547
I'M WALKING AWAY FROM HERE
HAPPY.

1553
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,758
<i>( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).</i>

1554
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:57,636
>> Jeff: YOU GOTTA LOVE DEVON.

1555
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,932
NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT A
FIRE-MAKING SHOWDOWN AS AN

1556
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:02,975
OPPORTUNITY.

1557
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:05,686
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR
PLAYERS OF THE SEASON.

1558
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,188
DEVON, COME ON OUT.

1559
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:14,778
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LOOK AT THAT.

1560
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:18,699
STANDING OVATION.

1561
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:21,159
ALL RIGHT, HAVE A SEAT, GUYS.

1562
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:24,871
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WERE ON THAT
OR NOT, BUT EVERYBODY STOOD UP.

1563
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:27,791
SO, FIRST, JUST WHAT IS THAT
LIKE?

1564
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:31,378
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST THIS YOUNG
MAN.

1565
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:32,504
YOU COME OUT TO PLAY THIS CRAZY
GAME.

1566
01:16:32,587 --> 01:16:36,341
WHEN PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU, WHAT
IS IT THEY SAY THEY'RE

1567
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:37,301
CONNECTING WITH, THIS LOVE?

1568
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:41,221
>> I'VE GOT NOTHING BUT GOOD
FEEDBACK, JEFF.

1569
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,347
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1570
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,891
I FEEL SO GRATEFUL TO # JUST TO
HAVE GOTTEN THIS WHOLE

1571
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:45,851
EXPERIENCE AND ALL THE POSITIVE
LOVE.

1572
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,854
>> Jeff: IS IT MOMS, DADS,
KIDS, EVERYBODY?

1573
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,857
>> YEAH, THE BEST IS JUST WHEN A
PARENT TELLS ME ABOUT HOW THEIR

1574
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,818
KID LOVES ME AND LOOKS UP TO ME.

1575
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:59,698
I JUST FEEL SO HONORED TO BE A
POSITIVE ROLE MODEL.

1576
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:03,869
<i>( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
>> Jeff: IT'S REALLY

1577
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,037
INTERESTING.

1578
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,748
MIKE WAS OUT HERE, AND HE SAID,
"I THOUGHT ABOUT VOTING FOR

1579
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:08,707
DEVON, BUT I DIDN'T."

1580
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,375
YOU DID.

1581
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,543
SO YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME.

1582
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:15,547
AND THEN WHEN CHRISSY, YOU KNOW,
SOME WOULD SAY DUMPED THE

1583
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,757
RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU, BECAUSE
SHE WAS IN GOOD SHAPE.

1584
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,884
SHE HAD EARNED HER WAY TO THE
END.

1585
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:19,885
NOW SHE NEEDED YOU TO HELP HER.

1586
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,845
YOU DIDN'T SAY, "WOW, WHY DOES
RYAN GET TO GO?"

1587
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:24,181
YOU SAID, "I LOVE IT.

1588
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:28,352
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY"
GUYS LOOK AT THIS AS GAME PLAY,

1589
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:32,856
NOTHING ELSE, JUST A GAME.

1590
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:34,900
>> IT IS JUST A GAME.

1591
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:38,403
IT'S ALL FUN, AND TO JUST BE
ABLE TO GET OUT THERE AND PLAY

1592
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,363
THE GAME.

1593
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:41,907
I WAS ALREADY BLESSED JUST TO
EVEN BE PRESENT.

1594
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,911
SO-- AND TO MAKE IT AS FAR AS I
DID.

1595
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,580
>> Jeff: I WATCHED DEVON
BACKSTAGE WATCHING THAT

1596
01:17:48,663 --> 01:17:49,206
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.

1597
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:50,248
FIRST TIME YOU'VE SEEN IT.

1598
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:53,794
AND YOU WERE EYE DON'T KNOW IF
YOU KNOW, BUT YOU WERE

1599
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:55,045
TRANSFIXED.

1600
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,089
WHAT-- JUST WHAT IS THAT FEELING
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING WHAT YOU

1601
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,758
KNOW HAPPENED, BUT YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN IT?

1602
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,052
>> YEAH, IT BROUGHT ME BACK,
DEFINITELY.

1603
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,262
IT BROUGHT BACK ALL OF THE
EMOTION I WAS FEELING AND

1604
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:04,930
EVERYTHING.

1605
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,056
AND I'M SUPER STOKED FOR BEN.

1606
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:09,601
I MEAN, HE DESERVED TO BE IN THE
FINAL THREE.

1607
01:18:09,684 --> 01:18:10,602
HE'S THE MAN.

1608
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:12,896
>> Jeff: AND THAT'S WHY
EVERYBODY LOVES DEVON.

1609
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:14,856
ALL RIGHT, AND IN CASE YOU'RE
WONDERING, THAT FINAL FOUR TWIST

1610
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,817
IS NOT A ONE-OFF.

1611
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,318
THAT IS A PART OF THE SHOW.

1612
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:21,405
SO YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE IT
AGAIN NEXT SEASON.

1613
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:23,240
DEVON, THE FINAL MEMBER OF THE
JURY.

1614
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:27,619
WE HAVE OUR FINAL THREE--
CHRISSY, RYAN, BEN, FINAL TRIBAL

1615
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:30,580
COUNCIL IS NEXT!

1616
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:56,940
♪ ♪ ♪
>> THERE IT IS, DAY 39.

1617
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,442
I'M GOING TO THE TREE.

1618
01:18:58,525 --> 01:18:59,860
>> HAVE FUN.

1619
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:00,193
>> DAY 39.

1620

1621
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:03,071
>> I'M MARKING THE TREE, DUDE.

1622
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:06,950
>> I'M SITTING HERE ON DAY 39 OF
"SURVIVOR," AS A SUPER FAN.

1623
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:12,497
MY DREAM POTENTIALLY FOUR VOTES
AWAY FROM WINNING A MILLION

1624
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,334
DOLLARS AND THE TITLE OF "SOLE
SURVIVOR."

1625
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,961
IT'S REALLY A DREAM COME TRUE.

1626
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:20,005
>> I JUST GOT CHILLS.

1627
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,214
>> WE MADE IT.

1628
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:24,968
>> STRATEGICALLY, IT HASN'T GONE
EXACTLY HOW I ANTICIPATED IT

1629
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:28,680
GOING, BUT I WAS WITH THE GAME
EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY AND HAD

1630
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:32,017
TO CONTROL MY WAY TO THE END,
LUKE A TRUE HUSTLER DOES, AND I

1631
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,060
THINK I DID THAT.

1632
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:35,520
LAST HUSTLER STANDING.

1633
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,689
I THINK I'M THE UNDERDOG GOING
INTO THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL, SO I

1634
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:41,193
NEED TO PERSUADE THE JURY I HAD
CONTROL OF THE GAME ENTIRE.

1635
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:42,027
NOW, THAT'S A COMPLETE LIE.

1636
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,405
BUT I THINK IF MIGHT WORK.

1637
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,198
OH, MY GOD!

1638
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:50,327
>> I SEE A CLEAN FRYING PAN,
EGGS!

1639
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:50,786
>> OH, MY GOD.

1640
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:53,371
>> MILK, SAUSAGES.

1641
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:53,955
CHAMPAGNE.

1642
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,373
DAY ONE, I WAS TERRIFIED.

1643
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,210
I THREW UP AT THE FIRST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

1644
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:58,960
THAT'S HOW TERRIFIED I WAS.

1645
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,337
>> FINAL THREE.

1646
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,379
>> FINAL THREE.

1647
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,881
>> FINAL THREE.

1648
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:04,049
CHEERS, YOU ALL.

1649
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,718
>> WHO WOULD KNOW I WOULD TIE
THE RECORD FOR MOST IMMUNITY

1650
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:08,929
CHALLENGES WON BY A WOMAN IN
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

1651
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:09,387
I KILLED IT.

1652
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,555
IT WAS A FUN RIDE.

1653
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,557
>> IT'S A RIDE, FOR SURE.

1654
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,851
>> THE RIDE IS NOT OVER YET.

1655
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,728
OF COURSE, THE GAME IS NOT OVER
YET.

1656
01:20:16,811 --> 01:20:23,235
I HAVE SOME FIERCE COMPETITION,
BUT I AM A MOM, SO I'M AN

1657
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:23,944
EVERYDAY HERO.

1658
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:26,404
I THINK I DESERVE TO WIN
TONIGHT.

1659
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,948
I THINK I PLAYED A HEROIC GAME.

1660
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:32,410
AND I WANT OTHER MOMS TO KNOW
THEY SHOULD ALWAYS DREAM IN

1661
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,038
THEMSELVES AND BELIEVE IN THEIR
DREAMS BECAUSE EVENTUALLY THEY

1662
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,248
MAY JUST COME TRUE.

1663
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:42,087
>> EVERYBODY HAPPY?

1664
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,549
>> YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER LET OFF
THE GAS.

1665
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:50,595
I'VE BEEN FULL THROTTLE 100%
FROM DAY ONE.

1666
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:54,140
THIS GAME AND I ARE LIKE TWO
PEAS IN A POD.

1667
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:56,977
BEING IN THE MARINES, I'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT OF BATTLES IN

1668
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,646
LIFE, AND TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE
A BATTLE.

1669
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:01,731
BECAUSE RYAN IS A GOOD TALKER.

1670
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:04,276
AND CHRISSY WON FOUR IMMUNITY
CHALLENGES.

1671
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:08,738
I HAVE TO GO IN HUMBLE BUT
CONFIDENT.

1672
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:12,033
MY GAME'S BEEN ABOUT PROVIDING
FOR MY FAMILY MORE THAN

1673
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,953
ANYTHINGES, AND AT THE END OF
THE DAY I NEED TO BRING A

1674
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,122
PAYCHECK HOME TO MY WIFE AND MY
TWO KIDS.

1675
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:21,293
I'VE NEVER HAD A MILLION-DOLLAR
NIGHT.

1676
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,629
AND I PROBABLY NEVER WILL AGAIN.

1677
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:34,723
THIS IS THE BIGGEST NIGHT OF MY
LIFE.

1678
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:54,659
THIS IS THE BIGGEST NIGHT OF MY
LIFE.

1679
01:21:54,743 --> 01:22:00,040
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF YOUR JURY.

1680
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:02,375
DESI.

1681
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,209
COLE.

1682
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,503
JP.

1683
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,130
JOE.

1684
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:08,173
LAUREN.

1685
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,633
ASHLEY.

1686
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:10,634
MIKE.

1687
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:16,556
AND DEVON, EIGHTH AND FINAL
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1688
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:20,018
WELCOME TO THE FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

1689
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,269
COUNCIL.

1690
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,855
CHRISSY, BEN, RYAN, TONIGHT WILL
BE YOUR BIGGEST BATTLE BECAUSE

1691
01:22:23,938 --> 01:22:27,150
TONIGHT THE POWER SHIFTS TO THE
JURY.

1692
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:31,029
THEY WILL DECIDE WHO DESERVES
THE TITLE OF "SOLE SURVIVOR" AND

1693
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,073
THE MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES
ALONG WITH IT.

1694
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:36,368
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL IS CENTERED
AROUND THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE

1695
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,162
GAME: OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.

1696
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:44,376
OUTWIT IS THE SOCIAL PART OF THE
GAME-- YOUR RELATIONSHIPS,

1697
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:47,170
ALLIANCES, RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE
OF THOSE ALLIANCES.

1698
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:50,423
THE OUTPLAY IS HOW DID YOU DEAL
WITH THE CONDITIONS PUT ON YOU

1699
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:51,216
BY THE GAME?

1700
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,885
YOU HAVE TO COMPETE IN
CHALLENGES.

1701
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,220
THERE ARE SWITCHES AND TWISTS TW
AND ADVANTAGES.

1702
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:58,264
AND THE LAST AND MAYBE THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART IS OUTLAST.

1703
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:04,229
DID YOU PUT ON THE JURY PEOPLE
WHO RESPECT HOW YOU OUTWITTED

1704
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:07,190
AND OUTPLAYED MORE THAN THE TWO
PEOPLE SITTING NEXT TO YOU.

1705
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:12,195
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MINUTE
TO GATHER YOUR THOUGHTS.

1706
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:14,280
WE'LL GET STARTED.

1707
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,954
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELL, THEY
SAID IT ALL.

1708
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:23,248
NOW IT COMES DOWN TO THE JURY
VOTES.

1709
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,917
OH, YOU HAVE A BUFF ON.

1710
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,253
THIS IS PERFECT.

1711
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,380
>> AVA.

1712
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:32,924
>> Jeff: THAT'S MY DAUGHTER'S
NAME.

1713
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:36,970
SO, I HAVE'S QUESTION FOR YOU:
DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU WOULD VOTE

1714
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:37,387
FOR?

1715
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:38,555
>> Jeff: YES.

1716
01:23:38,638 --> 01:23:40,724
>> OKAY, HERE'S A PIECE OF
"SURVIVOR--" REAL DEAL-- HERE'S

1717
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:41,975
A "SURVIVOR" PEN.

1718
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:42,767
DON'T SHOW ANYBODY.

1719
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,435
USE MY BACK.

1720
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,061
WRITE DOWN THE NAME.

1721
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,604
DON'T ANYBODY SAY ANYTHING.

1722
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:50,108
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF
YOU AGREE WITH THE MAJORITY OF

1723
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:53,611
THE JURY.

1724
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:54,112
OKAY?

1725
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,281
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

1726
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,616
FOLD IT UP.

1727
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,534
OKAY, KEEP THAT.

1728
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:03,788
NEXT TIME I SEE YOU, I WILL HAVE
THE VOTES.

1729
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:16,301
IT'S THE "SURVIVOR" FINALE LIVE
FROM LOS ANGELES.

1730
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:20,305
>> Jeff: OKAY, CHRISSY, BEN,
RYAN, LET'S GET STARTED WITH THE

1731
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:22,307
WHO WANTS TO GET US STARTED.

1732
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:22,807
DESI.

1733
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,058
>> ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

1734
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:27,645
SO, CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THREE
OF YOU FOR BEING HERE IN THIS

1735
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:28,813
POSITION.

1736
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,316
CHRISSY, HATS OFF TO YOU FOR
WINNING FOUR INDIVIDUAL

1737
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:35,320
BEN, HATS OFF TO YOU FOR GETTING
IDOLS AND KNOW CONTINUING IN THE

1738
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:36,529
GAME.

1739
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:39,824
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, RYAN, IT
FEELS AS IF EVERYBODY FELT THEY

1740
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,118
COULD BEAT YOU AT THE FINAL
THREE AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

1741
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:44,996
SITTING HERE TONIGHT SO I'D LIKE
TO GIVE YOU THE STUDENT TO

1742
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:47,665
CONVINCE US AS TO WHY YOU'RE
SITTING HERE BASED UPON YOUR

1743
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:47,957
SOCIAL GAME?

1744
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,042
>> SURE.

1745
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:50,835
SO EVERYTHING IN MY GAME
EMANATED FROM THE SOCIAL GAME.

1746
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,338
I FOUND THE ADVANTAGE ON DAY ONE
ON THE BOAT.

1747
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:57,300
I USED THAT ADVANTAGE TO BUILD A
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRISSY AND

1748
01:24:57,383 --> 01:25:00,970
DEVON AND THAT WAS A SOCIAL GAME
PLAY ON MY PART.

1749
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,681
NOW, THE SEVEN, I FEEL LIKE WAS
ACTUALLY MY IDEA.

1750
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,226
I CONJURED IT BECAUSE I HAD
STRONG INCLINATIONS AND I HAD

1751
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:09,187
GAME MOVES BASED ON THE
ADVANTAGE AND THE RELATIONSHIPS

1752
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,356
THAT I COULD BUILD WITH THAT
ADVANTAGE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE

1753
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,400
GAME AND FORM THAT SEVEN GOING
INTO THE MERGE WITH THE NUMBERS.

1754
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:18,154
SO I HAD TO DEPEND ON FACTORS
THAT I'M GOOD AT.

1755
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,032
I HAD TO DEPEND ON THE SOCIAL
RELATIONSHIPS THAT I COULD BUILD

1756
01:25:21,115 --> 01:25:21,825
WITH PEOPLE.

1757
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,034
THAT WAS MY STRENGTH IN THE
GAME.

1758
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:25,370
>> THEN, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHY YOU MAY HAVE FELT THAT IT

1759
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:30,250
WAS WISE TO THEN NEVER HAVE A
SINGLE STRATEGIC CONVERSATION

1760
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:31,543
WITH ME?

1761
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:35,171
YOU KNOW, THAT SHOWS A FAULT IN
YOUR SOCIAL GAME BECAUSE YOU PUT

1762
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,214
ME ON THE JURY.

1763
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,591
>> I DON'T HAVE A STRATEGIC
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.

1764
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:40,844
THE RELATIONSHIP WOULD PARLAY
INTO THE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP.

1765
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:45,557
BUT A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION
THAT I HAD WITH YOU WAS FILTERED

1766
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,432
THROUGH DEVON.

1767
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:47,392
>> DEVON, CAN YOU COSINE ON ANY
OF THIS?

1768
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:51,813
>> YEAH, UH--
>> I MEAN, THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

1769
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:56,401
RYAN'S SITTING IN THE HOT SEAT,
AND YOU MIGHT MAKE OR BREAK WHAT

1770
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:57,569
HAPPENS.

1771
01:25:57,652 --> 01:26:00,363
>> UP UNTIL THE ALLIANCE OF
SEVEN, RYAN'S SOCIAL PLAY WAS

1772
01:26:00,446 --> 01:26:01,573
USED THROUGH ME.

1773
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,408
>> THERE WAS A COMMUNICATION
WITH RYAN WHEN I GOT BLINDSIDED

1774
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:05,535
WHEN YOU GUYS FLIPPED?

1775
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:06,744
>> RYAN DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THAT.

1776
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,746
>> YEAH, THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD
POINT.

1777
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,748
I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE JP
VOTE.

1778
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:13,084
I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE JOE
VOTE.

1779
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:15,920
JP WAS ONE OF MY CLOSEST ALLIES
AT THE TIME.

1780
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:19,632
>> I'M GLAD WE STARTED WITH THE
OUTWIT BECAUSE, HONESTLY, RYAN,

1781
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:23,887
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE THE
PUPPET MASTER WHEN IT CAME TO

1782
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:24,429
DEVON.

1783
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,388
YOU PUT HIM AS A FRONT.

1784
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:28,725
NO ONE EXPECTED YOU, AND DEVON
GOT THE HEAT.

1785
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:30,393
I RESPECT THE PLAY AND I
APPRECIATE IT.

1786
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:37,609
>> I FEEL LIKE SOME OF THESE
TRIBALS PEOPLE MAKE PITCHES AND

1787
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:38,902
RAH-RAH-PITCHES TO THE JURY.

1788
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:41,738
AND KING BEN--
>> I WANT TO GO WITH KING BEN.

1789
01:26:41,821 --> 01:26:43,823
BEN, YOUR SOCIAL GAISMS
HORRIBLE.

1790
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:45,950
YOU AND I NEVER COMIEWCTD.

1791
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,286
THE ONLY CONVERSATION I RECALL
IS YOU YELLING AT ME.

1792
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:51,581
AND CHRISSY, YOU AND OUR
RELATIONSHIP-- BOAFGTHS YOU ARE

1793
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:52,624
FANS.

1794
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:56,294
YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT AT SOME
POINT WE WOULD BE HERE.

1795
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,548
AND YOU FOCUSED ON CHALLENGES
AND IDOLS AND CHAOS, AND FORGOT

1796
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:07,847
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
ASPECTS OF "SURVIVOR."

1797
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,183
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

1798
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:11,434
THIS SOCIAL ASPECT OF IT IS ALL
NEW TO ME.

1799
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:14,312
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I COULDN'T
EVEN SIT AT A CHRISTMAS DINNER

1800
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:20,360
WITH MY OWN FAMILY, LET ALONE
SIT ON A BEACH WITH A BUNCH OF

1801
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:21,778
STRANGERS AND PLAY A SOCIAL
GAME.

1802
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:24,656
I'M OUT HERE LEARNING HOW TO
INTERACT WITH YOU GUYS AND

1803
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:29,661
STRANGERS, NOT ONLY AS A GAME
PLAY, BUT JUST TRYING TO-- JUST

1804
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:33,665
TRYING TO BETTER MYSELF AS-- AS
A FRIEND AND A MAN.

1805
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:34,457
YOU KNOW?

1806
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:35,583
>> I CAN ANSWER?

1807
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:36,834
>> SURE.

1808
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,420
>> YEAH, SO I THINK THAT I JUST
HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SOCIAL

1809
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:43,508
GAME THAN NEEZ GUYS WHO PLANNED
MANY, MANY ALLIANCES AND WANTED

1810
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:44,634
TO BLINDSIDE THIS PERSON, THAT
PERSON.

1811
01:27:44,717 --> 01:27:48,513
I GOT TO THE FINAL THREE,
FRANKLY, BY BEING LOYAL TO MY

1812
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:49,347
ALLIANCES.

1813
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:52,976
I STAYED LOYAL TO RYAN THE
ENTIRE TIME.

1814
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:53,977
I STAYED LOYAL TO JP.

1815
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,521
I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS GOING TO BE
BLINDSIDED.

1816
01:27:56,604 --> 01:28:00,233
SO MY GAME WAS NOT TO GO OUT AND
MAKE A MILLION DIFFERENT MOVES.

1817
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:02,485
AS FAR AS THE OTHER ASPECT OF
SOCIAL GOES, I REALLY DID TRY

1818
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:06,739
AND GET TO KNOW EACH OF YOU
INDIVIDUALLY, AND I STILL COULD

1819
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:09,033
PROBABLY TELL EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF YOU PERSONAL DETAILS ABOUT

1820
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,493
YOUR LIFE, LIKE REAL THINGS.

1821
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:12,161
>> TELL ME MY REAL THING.

1822
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:15,039
>> SO WHAT-- OKAY, ONE OF THE
REASONS YOU DON'T WANT TO GET

1823
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,499
MARRIED IS BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS
GOT DIVORCED WHEN YOU WERE

1824
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:19,669
YOUNG, AND THAT WAS HORRIBLE FOR
YOU, AND YOU DON'T THINK THAT

1825
01:28:19,752 --> 01:28:21,504
MARRIAGE WORKS.

1826
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:25,049
>> Jeff: COLE, WHERE DO YOU
WEIGH IN ON THE SOCIAL PART OF

1827
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,175
THE GAME?

1828
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,219
>> RIGHT, SO I WANT TO FOCUS ON
BEN HERE FOR A MINUTE.

1829
01:28:28,302 --> 01:28:30,388
I KNOW I WAS A TARGET OF YOURS
BASED ON SOME FOOD ISSUES THAT

1830
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:30,722
WENT DOWN.

1831
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:31,973
>> RIGHT.

1832
01:28:32,056 --> 01:28:35,601
>> I'LL GO AHEAD AND ADMIT TO
EVERYONE THAT I DID EAT MYSELF A

1833
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:37,061
LITTLE EXTRA PEANUT BUTTER.

1834
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:40,189
YOU MANAGED TO PAINT A PICTURE
OF ME BEING A THIEF, AND IT PUT

1835
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:41,399
A HUGE TARGET ON MY BACK.

1836
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:42,567
>> RIGHT.

1837
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:45,111
>> HOWEVER, IF YOU CAN JUST
CLEAR MY NAME THEN I WOULD BE

1838
01:28:45,194 --> 01:28:47,947
LIKE, WELL, THAT WAS A BRILLIANT
SOCIAL STRATEGIC MOVE.

1839
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:52,076
>> WELL, YES, I DID PAINT YOU A
TARGET BECAUSE YOU WERE

1840
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,579
PHYSICALLY STRONG, KILLING IT IN
ALL THE CHALLENGES, AND IF THAT

1841
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,915
WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET
PEOPLE TO TURN ON YOU, WELL, I'M

1842
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,250
GOING TO USE THAT.

1843
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:02,420
NOTHING PERSONAL AGAINST YOU--
>> NO, COLE, IT WENT BEYOND JUST

1844
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,880
PAINTING A TARGET ON YOUR BACK
ABOUT FOOD.

1845
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:06,424
HE HAD SOMETHING, A VENDETTA
AGAINST YOU.

1846
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:07,175
>> NO.

1847
01:29:07,258 --> 01:29:08,426
>> WHO REALLY WANT RESPECTED
YOU?

1848
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:12,555
WHO DID YOU HAVE THE BEST
CONVERSATIONS WITH?

1849
01:29:12,638 --> 01:29:16,059
WHO DIDN'T YOU GET INTO AN
ARGUMENT WITH?

1850
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:16,768
>> ME.

1851
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,145
>> NO, IT WAS A STRATEGIC MOVE.

1852
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:22,398
AND YOU AND I TALKED MAN TO MAN
AND I OWN THAT.

1853
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:25,902
I SAID I HAVE TO WORK ON THE
SOCIAL GAME AND SAT ON THE BEACH

1854
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:28,780
WITH LAUREN AND DEVON AND TOLD
STORIES I HAVEN'T TOLD FRIENDS

1855
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:29,280
BACK HOME.

1856
01:29:29,363 --> 01:29:31,407
I OPENED UP WITH MIKE.

1857
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:31,783
I TOLD STORIES.

1858
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:33,034
THAT'S REAL.

1859
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:34,160
THIS IS MY LIFE.

1860
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:37,246
>> BEN, YOU'RE SAYING YOU TOLD
PEOPLE A LOT OF THINGS BUT

1861
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:38,623
CHRISSY GENUINELY REACHED OUT
AND ASKED ABOUT PEOPLE.

1862
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:40,958
AND THAT'S HUGE SOCIALLY.

1863
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,043
PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THEMSELVES.

1864
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:45,379
SHE JUST SPIT OUT INFORMATION
ABOUT JOE'S CHILDHOOD.

1865
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:47,673
I REMEMBER HEARING HER HAVING
THESE CONVERSATIONS THINKING

1866
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:49,217
THIS WOMAN'S A GENIUS.

1867
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,426
>> THANK YOU, ASHLEY.

1868
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:53,971
AND I THINK WE KNOW MIKE AND I
HAD A GREAT SOCIAL CONNECTION.

1869
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:57,475
DEVON AND I HAD A GREAT SOCIAL
CONNECTION.

1870
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:00,311
COLE, AND YOU, YOU GOT A 34 ON
YOUR S.A.T.

1871
01:30:00,394 --> 01:30:04,023
>> YOU CAN GO ABOUT MAKING
FRIENDSHIPS WITH HEME BUT IT'S

1872
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:07,652
HOW YOU USE THE FRIENDSHIPS AND
RELATIONSHIPS YOU MADE DURING

1873
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,654
THE GAME AND I DON'T KNOW THAT
ABOUT YOU.

1874
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:14,659
>> GETTING TO KNOW PEOPLE HERE
WAS PART OF MY GAME PLAY.

1875
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:18,788
LEARNING WHAT MADE YOU TICK TO
SEE IF I SORT OF AGREED WITH

1876
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:20,414
YOUR PHILOSOPHY ON HOW TO WIN
THIS GAME.

1877
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,333
FOR EXAMPLE, DEVON, WHEN I GOT
TO KNOW DEVON--

1878
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:23,584
>> IT WAS THROUGH ME!

1879
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,711
>> RYAN, JUST BECAUSE YOUR BODY
IS PRESENT DOESN'T MEAN OTHER

1880
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:31,342
PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVE A
RELATIONSHIP THROUGH YOU.

1881
01:30:31,425 --> 01:30:33,344
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T--
>> YOU'RE JUST MAKING A LOT OF

1882
01:30:33,427 --> 01:30:35,221
>> I'M NOT MAKING A LOT OF
STATEMENTS.

1883
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:37,348
>> THAT WE ARE NOW FINDING OUT
ARE NOT ACTUALLY ACCURATE.

1884
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:40,726
SO HE IS GOING TO--
>> AS FAR AS THIS GOES, THE

1885
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:46,357
SMALL HE SAID/SHE SAID STUFF IS
NOT MAKING AN IMPACT ON THE

1886
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,525
DECISION.

1887
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,277
>> I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ON A
HUMAN LEVEL TO EACH YOU.

1888
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,530
I AM EXTREMELY PROUD OF EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF YOU ALL FOR MAKING

1889
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:53,823
IT THIS FAR.

1890
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:57,326
WE STILL RESPECT EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF YOU AND I WANT TO REMIND

1891
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,871
YOU TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND
REALIZE THIS IS JUST A GAME.

1892
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:02,456
OUTSIDE AND THIS GAME YOU CAN
STILL TRUST THE PEOPLE AROUND

1893
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,583
YOU.

1894
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:07,587
>> I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
SAYING THAT BECAUSE IT WASN'T

1895
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:08,713
DIRECTED AT JUST THEM.

1896
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:13,217
IT WAS DIRECTED AT ALL OF US.

1897
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:16,304
>> I THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT, BUT
WE HAD A GREAT DAY.

1898
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:17,847
>> THAT'S GOOD.

1899
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,015
LET'S MOVE ON.

1900
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:21,058
>> Jeff: WE WILL MOVE ON TO
THE OUTPLAY PART OF THE GAME.

1901
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,394
THIS IS HOW YOU RESPOND TO THE
CONDITIONS OF THE GAMEUE HAVE TO

1902
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:24,187
BUILD A SHELTER.

1903
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,105
YOU HAVE TO COMPETE IN
CHALLENGES.

1904
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:30,902
THERE ARE TWISTS, SWITCHES,
ADVANTAGES, HOW YOU RESPOND TO

1905
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:33,571
THOSE IS NOW WHAT THEY WILL
QUESTION YOU WITH B.

1906
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:35,615
WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST?

1907
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:36,824
COLE.

1908
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:40,578
>> AS A WILDERNESS GUY MYSELF,
THE SURVIVAL SKILLS MEAN A LOT

1909
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:44,916
TO ME, BUILDING THE SHELTER,
MAKING A FIRE, AND I RESPECT THE

1910
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:46,709
HELL OUT OF CHRISSY FOR WINNING
FOUR CHALLENGES.

1911
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:49,045
THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE.

1912
01:31:49,128 --> 01:31:52,465
BEN, YOU FOUND ALL OF YOUR IDOLS
AND PLAYED THEM PERFECTLY.

1913
01:31:52,548 --> 01:31:56,093
RYAN, YOU HAVEN'T DONE MUCH
AROUND CAMP.

1914
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:58,763
THERE HAVE NOT BEEN A LOT OF
SURVIVAL SKILLS DEMONSTRATED.

1915
01:31:58,846 --> 01:31:59,222
JUST BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

1916
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,223
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1917
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:02,600
I CAN'T ARGUE ANY OF THOSE
POINTS YOU JUST SAID.

1918
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:05,728
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE
EVER BEEN CAMPING IN MY ENTIRE

1919
01:32:05,811 --> 01:32:09,774
LIFE FOR ME SO I KNEW I COULD
NOT BE A PROVIDER LIKE JP COULD.

1920
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:13,444
I CANNOT CRACK A COCONUT LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE CAN, I CANNOT

1921
01:32:13,527 --> 01:32:14,445
COOK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE CAN.

1922
01:32:14,528 --> 01:32:16,822
I HAVE NOT DONE ANY OF THESE
THINGS BEFORE.

1923
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:21,452
I DID NOT WANT TO STEP ON ANY
TOES IF SOMEBODY THOUGHT THEY

1924
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:22,620
COULD DO BETTER.

1925
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,747
IF I WENT IN AND BURNEDLET RICE
WHERE WOULD THAT LEAVE ME.

1926
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:29,794
>> I HAD NEVER TENDED A FIRE OR
OPENED A COCONUT OR USED A

1927
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:33,339
MACHETE OR EVEN SEEN A MACHETE,
SO FOR YOU TO SAY, I DIDN'T WANT

1928
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:37,677
TO TRY THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT
WHAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO."

1929
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,805
>> YOU SAID, YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
MESS UP.

1930
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:42,974
NONE OF US WANTED TO MESS UP,
EITHER.

1931
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:44,850
>> BUT I'M BEING HONEST.

1932
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:46,435
THAT'S NOT MY STRENGTH IN THE
GAME.

1933
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,104
>> YOU COULD HAVE GONE TO GET
THE WATER--

1934
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:51,023
>> SAT AROUND AND TALKED ABOUT
ICED COFFEE--

1935
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:52,984
>> YOU LITERALLY HARDLY EVER
WENT FOR WATER.

1936
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:57,154
>> LET'S GET TO THE IDOLS AND
THE ADVANTAGES BECAUSE WE KNOW

1937
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:58,656
AT CAMP LIFE, WE'RE NOT ABOUT
THAT LIFE.

1938
01:32:58,739 --> 01:32:59,490
>> SURE.

1939
01:32:59,573 --> 01:33:00,992
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ADVANTAGE
FIRST.

1940
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:03,411
DAY ONE, I FOUND THE ADVANTAGE
ON THE BOAT.

1941
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:05,997
THEN AS WE SAID BEFORE, I USED
THE ADVANTAGE TO PROGRESS TO THE

1942
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,206
END OF THE GAME.

1943
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:10,042
THE STORY WITH THE IDOL, WHICH
WAS HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE FLAG

1944
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:11,168
BACK AT CAMP.

1945
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:14,171
I DIG UP THE IDOL, JP WAS THERE,
I SHOVE IT IN MY PANTS.

1946
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:19,176
MASS CHAOS ENENSUES --
>> I HAD NO IDEA RYAN HAD IT.

1947
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,845
>> THAT'S WHY SHE RODE ME AND
JUMPED ON MY BACK.

1948
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,556
>> AND I SET UP THAT ENTIRE
SITUATION.

1949
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:25,975
>> THAT WAS WELL PLAYED BECAUSE
IT PUT A BIGGER TARGET ON MY

1950
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:26,309
BACK AT THE END OF IT.

1951
01:33:26,392 --> 01:33:27,476
>> RIGHT.

1952
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,814
AND BASICALLY I HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO PLAY IT ONCE YOU GUYS

1953
01:33:31,897 --> 01:33:32,523
FLUSHED IT.

1954
01:33:32,606 --> 01:33:33,733
THAT WAS THE STORY OF THE IDOL.

1955
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:37,236
>> WOULD LIKE TO SAY I'M VERY
PROUD OF EVERY FEMALE THAT MADE

1956
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,905
IT THIS FAR IN THE GAME ON THIS
JURY AS WELL AS CHRISSY WHO BLEW

1957
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:42,199
US ALL AWAY WITH WINNING FOUR.

1958
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:47,455
>> DESI, LAUREN, ASHLEY, AND I
TOOK EIGHT OF THE NINE.

1959
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:49,749
>> I JUST WANT TO GIVE CHRISSY
HUGE CREDIT FOR THAT.

1960
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:50,750
>> THANK YOU.

1961
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:53,544
SO I WAS TERRIFIED WHEN THE
CHALLENGES STARTED.

1962
01:33:53,627 --> 01:33:56,339
I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY SPORTS
AS A KID.

1963
01:33:56,422 --> 01:33:59,300
I WAS TOLD MY WHOLE LIFE THAT I
SUCK AT ANYTHING PHYSICAL.

1964
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:00,926
I THREW UP ON THE DECK ON THE
FIRST CHALLENGE.

1965
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:06,057
BECAUSE THIS WAS THE ONE THING
THAT I WAS SO SCARED OF.

1966
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,142
SOMEHOW, I FOUND THE COURAGE TO
JUST DO THIS.

1967
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:13,230
AND I'M REALLY PROUD THAT THERE
HAVE BEEN 258 FEMALE CONTESTANTS

1968
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:17,401
ON "SURVIVOR," AND THERE ARE NOW
ONLY FOUR THAT HAVE WON FOUR

1969
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,070
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITIES, AND I AM
ONE OF THEM.

1970
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:22,281
I ALSO GOT TWO INDIVIDUAL
REWARDS AND THE SECRET ADVANTAGE

1971
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:24,033
FOR THE FINAL TRIBAL.

1972
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:26,202
>> YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF
YOURSELF.

1973
01:34:26,285 --> 01:34:27,453
>> I'M ALMOST 50 YEARS OLD.

1974
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:30,998
>> YOU APPLIED FOR 16 YEARS AND
ARE A PROVEN FACT THAT GIVING UP

1975
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:33,376
IS NOT AN OPTION IN YOUR BOOK
AND CONGRATULATIONS.

1976
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:34,043
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1977
01:34:34,126 --> 01:34:36,295
>> I MEAN, WE HAVE A QUEEN.

1978
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:40,758
WE HAVE QUEEN CHRISSY, WHO WON
FOUR INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

1979
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:42,426
CHALLENGES AND YOU CONTINUE
WINNING.

1980
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,928
AND I RESPECT THAT, BECAUSE JUST
LIKE BEN, YOUR BACK WAS AGAINST

1981
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:46,263
THE WALL, AND YOU HAD TO WIN.

1982
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:47,598
AND I LOVE BEN.

1983
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:50,601
I LOVE THE WAY YOU PLAYED.

1984
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:54,480
LAST NIGHT IT CAME DOWN TO THE
FIRE AND DEVON WENT HOME.

1985
01:34:54,563 --> 01:34:56,941
IT TOOK MY 10 DAYS TO FIND TWO
IDOLS.

1986
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,777
YOU FOUND THREE IN SEVERAL DAYS.

1987
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:03,614
WAS IT EASY OR DID YOU PUT IN
THE WORK AND THE EFFORT?

1988
01:35:03,697 --> 01:35:06,826
>> AFTER THE BLINDSIDE AGAINST
LAUREN I KNEW I WAS ON MY OWN.

1989
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:09,578
HAD NO ALLIANCE.

1990
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:12,456
NOBODY WANTED TO LOOK AT ME OR
BE SEEN TALKING TO ME.

1991
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,626
I CHOSE TO GET UP IN THE MORNING
BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE AND GO

1992
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:16,669
LOOK.

1993
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:18,754
I DIDN'T SIT AROUND AND WATCH
THE SUNSET, YOU KNOW.

1994
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:19,922
WHILE THEY WERE SLEEPING, I WAS
LOOKING FOR IDOLS.

1995
01:35:20,005 --> 01:35:24,593
WHEN I RAN OUT OF IDOLS, HER
SECRET ADVANTAGE GAVE ME LIFE,

1996
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:26,303
AND I TOOK EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND
NEVER QUIT.

1997
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:27,805
THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS GOING TO
SAVE ME WAS ME.

1998
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:32,810
SO, YES, I PUT IN THE TIME TO
FIND THE IDOLS.

1999
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,019
>> SO HERE'S A BETTER QUESTION.

2000
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:36,939
THERE IS A POINT IN THE GAME
WHERE THERE WERE FOUR OF YOU AND

2001
01:35:37,022 --> 01:35:38,149
THEN THERE WAS BEN.

2002
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:41,986
HOW DID YOU ALL ALLOW BEN THE
OPPORTUNITY TO GO OFF ON HIS OWN

2003
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:44,822
THIS MANY TIMES TO FIND THAT
MANY IDOLS?

2004
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:47,783
>> I WAS ONE STEP AHEAD ON EVERY
IDOL.

2005
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:51,162
THESE GUYS WENT LOOKING AT THE
RAFT, BUT I ALREADY HAD IT IN MY

2006
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,329
POCKET.

2007
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:53,998
MIKE WAS LOOKING UNDER THE
SHELTER, I ALREADY HAD IT IN MY

2008
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:55,166
POCKET.

2009
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:59,670
MIKE WAS LOOKING AT THE ROCK
PIT, I HAD ALREADY HAD INT IN MY

2010
01:35:59,753 --> 01:36:04,216
SHE PLAYED A FAKE IDOL AND I
KNEW IT WAS FAKE BECAUSE I

2011
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,134
ALREADY HAD IT IN MY POCKET.

2012
01:36:05,217 --> 01:36:10,389
>> WE TRIED TO TRAIL HIM--
>> FOUR PEOPLE.

2013
01:36:10,473 --> 01:36:12,850
>> THAT WAS A GAME FLAW FOR ALL
FOUR OF US.

2014
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:17,521
>> Jeff: IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON
TO THE OUTLAF PART OF THE GAME.

2015
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:18,856
THIS SHIFTS BACK TO YOU GUYS.

2016
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:22,693
DID YOU PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE ON
THE JURY?

2017
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:26,906
DID THEY RESPECT YOUR OUTEXPWIT
OUTPLAY MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO?

2018
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:29,116
THIS IS YOUR LAST MOMENT TO MAKE
SURE THE PEOPLE YOU PUT OVER

2019
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,036
THERE ARE ABOUT TO WRITE YOUR
NAME DOWN.

2020
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:33,078
RYAN, YOU WANT TO GO FIRST?

2021
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:36,540
>> YES, SO I COULD NOT RELY ON
WINNING CHALLENGES.

2022
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:38,083
I KNEW THAT GOING INTO THE GAME,
SO I HAD TO BUILD THESE SOCIAL

2023
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:40,085
RELATIONSHIPS TO GET ME THROUGH
THE EARLY PART OF THE GAME, AND

2024
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:41,378
IT WORKED.

2025
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:45,090
AND I WAS AT 13 OUT OF 15 TRIBAL
COUNCILS, AND MY NAME WAS NEVER

2026
01:36:45,174 --> 01:36:46,300
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

2027
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:49,720
AND IT WAS NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE
WANTED TO TAKE ME TO THE END.

2028
01:36:49,803 --> 01:36:52,556
IT WAS BECAUSE I BUILT ENOUGH
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND BONDS

2029
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,559
WITH PEOPLE THAT THEY WOULDN'T
LET MY NAME COME UP ON THE

2030
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:56,810
CHOPPING BLOCK.

2031
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:58,020
I THINK I HAD MORE DEALS TO THE
END THAN ANYBODY ELSE DID, AND

2032
01:36:58,103 --> 01:37:00,606
THAT'S A CREDIT TO MY GAME.

2033
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:04,527
THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF CREDIT
FOR PLAYING HARD, I BUT I

2034
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,070
FORTIFIED THE SOCIAL BONDS,
SECURED AN IDOL, GOT AN

2035
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:07,905
ADVANTAGE, AND I NEVER GAVE UP.

2036
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:10,074
THAT'S WHY I'M SITTING HERE.

2037
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:13,077
NOBODY DRAGGED ME HERE.

2038
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,245
NOBODY.

2039
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:16,539
AND--
>> RYAN, I CAN DISRUPT FOR A

2040
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:16,830
SECOND?

2041
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:17,790
>> YES.

2042
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:20,167
>> WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED IN
PLAYING THIS GAME?

2043
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:23,254
>> I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MYSELF.

2044
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:26,757
I GOT REJUVENATED WHEN MY DAD
CAME OUT HERE ON DAY 31.

2045
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,927
THAT WAS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE
HONESTLY.

2046
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:32,596
THIS GAME SAY CONFLUENCE OF
CONSTANT EMOTIONS OVERLAPPING

2047
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,847
EACH OTHER.

2048
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:38,018
IT'S MAY ME REALIZE ABOUT MYSELF
THEY VALUE THE SIMPLICITIES OF

2049
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:41,105
LIFE, HAVING PEOPLE CLOSE TO
YOU, HAVING A FAMILY.

2050
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:44,483
YOU ALL KNOW I'M A HUGE FAN OF
"SURVIVOR" AND IT'S BEEN A DREAM

2051
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,319
TO PLAY THE GAME BUT I NEVER
LOOKED AT MYSELF INTRO

2052
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:52,116
SPECTIVELY AS THIS GAME HAS
COMPELLED ME TO DO.

2053
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:52,950
>> Jeff: BEN.

2054
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:55,828
>> MINE IS GOING TO BE SHORT AND
SWEET.

2055
01:37:55,911 --> 01:37:58,747
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF I HAD A HAND
IN PUTTING THERE BECAUSE YOU

2056
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:00,082
GUYS WERE HURDLES.

2057
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:03,252
YOU GUYS WERE A HURDLE TO A
MILLION DOLLARS PUP WERE A

2058
01:38:03,335 --> 01:38:06,630
THREAT TO ME PROVIDING FOR MY
FAMILY, AND I RESPECT YOU GUYS

2059
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:07,423
AS THREATS.

2060
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:12,845
BUT I HAD TO PUT YOU IN THOSE
SEATS.

2061
01:38:12,928 --> 01:38:16,432
>> BEN, WIN OR LOSE TONIGHT, YOU
HAVE PLAYED ONE OF THE BEST

2062
01:38:16,515 --> 01:38:17,808
GAMES IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

2063
01:38:17,891 --> 01:38:19,852
AND YOU WILL BE A LEGEND IN THIS
GAME.

2064
01:38:19,935 --> 01:38:24,773
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO YOU GIVE US
NOT WHY YOU VOTED US OUT, BUT

2065
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:25,608
WHY YOU SHOULD BE THE WINNER
TONIGHT?

2066
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:30,654
>> I HAVE TO PIGG PIGGYBACK OFF
THAT.

2067
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:35,326
FOR SOMEONE WHO HAD HIS BACK
AGAINST THE WALL FOR SO LONG.

2068
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:37,036
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE GIVING
UP.

2069
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,955
I KNOW YOU'RE A FIGHTER AND I
KNOW YOU HAVE IT IN YOU, AND I

2070
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:41,165
NEED MORE.

2071
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:44,627
>> YES, SIR, THE REASON I SHOULD
BE THE SOLE SURVIVOR THIS YEAR

2072
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:47,796
BECAUSE AFTER BEING DEEMED A
KING AND DEEMED A DICTATOR BY

2073
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:51,508
HER, I NEVER QUIT LOOKING AND I
NEVER QUIT BATTLING AGAINST ALL

2074
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:52,217
OF YOU ALL.

2075
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:53,177
I WAS NOT PUT HERE.

2076
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,386
I GOT MYSELF HERE.

2077
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:58,390
AND I-- I TOLD EVERYONE I WAS
OUT HERE FOR MY FAMILY, AND I AM

2078
01:38:58,474 --> 01:38:59,683
OUT HERE FOR MY FAMILY.

2079
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:02,436
AND I TALKED ABOUT STUFF THAT
HAPPENED IN THE MILITARY.

2080
01:39:02,519 --> 01:39:05,356
I CAME BACK WITH P.T.S.D.

2081
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:09,568
A LOT OF COMBAT VETS DO, AND ME
BEING OUT HERE NOW IS A MESSAGE

2082
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:13,489
TO ALL THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO
ARE STRUGGLING THAT YOU DON'T

2083
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:15,032
HAVE TO FEEL ALONE.

2084
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:18,202
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL THAT
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS.

2085
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:19,453
IT'S POWERFUL.

2086
01:39:19,536 --> 01:39:25,417
SO IF I CAN BE LABELED A HERO
FOR SHOWING ALL THOSE VETS THAT

2087
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:28,879
IT CAN BE DONE AND THERE IS
HAPPINESS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

2088
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:31,882
TO WORK HARD FOR IT.

2089
01:39:31,965 --> 01:39:34,134
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT CAN BE DONE.

2090
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:38,055
SO...

2091
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:39,306
>> Jeff: CHRISSY.

2092
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,059
>> OKAY, I CAME INTO THIS GAME
TOTALLY UNDERESTIMATING MYSELF.

2093
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:45,437
AND THROUGHOUT THE GAME, I
REALIZED THERE ARE TIMES I NEED

2094
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:47,940
TO JUST SAY, "I'M AWESOME AT
THAT."

2095
01:39:48,023 --> 01:39:53,737
AND IN THIS CASE, I'M SAYING, I
KICKED ASS CHALLENGES.

2096
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,031
I KICKED ASS STRATEGICALLY.

2097
01:39:56,115 --> 01:39:57,908
I THINK I TRUTH MADE CONNECTIONS
WITH EACH OF YOU.

2098
01:39:57,991 --> 01:40:02,037
I GOT TO THE END PLAYING A GOOD,
CLEAN, SOLID GAME WITHOUT

2099
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:02,579
LEAVING A TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION.

2100
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,748
I DID AN AWESOME JOB.

2101
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:09,753
BUT I WANT TO SAY ALL MOMS ARE
HEROES BECAUSE THEY PUT OTHER

2102
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:10,421
PEOPLE BEFORE THEMSELVES.

2103
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:12,214
THEY DON'T EVEN STOP AND THINK.

2104
01:40:12,297 --> 01:40:13,090
THEY PUT THEMSELVESES ON THE
LINE EVERY DAY.

2105
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:16,343
YES, NOT LIKE A FIREFIGHTER OR A
MARINE.

2106
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:19,680
BUT IT IS WITH GREAT LOVE AND NO
THOUGHT THAT THEY GET IN THERE

2107
01:40:19,763 --> 01:40:21,306
AND DO WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO
FOR THEIR KIDS.

2108
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:25,686
AND SO, MOMS ARE NOT ONLY
HEROES.

2109
01:40:25,769 --> 01:40:28,230
BUT WE ARE ALSO HEALERS, AND WE
ARE ALSO HUSTLERS.

2110
01:40:28,313 --> 01:40:35,946
SO IN A WAY, MY GAME AND WHO I
AM IS ALL PARTS OF THAT.

2111
01:40:36,029 --> 01:40:39,491
AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE FACT
THAT I'VE BEEN APPLYING FOR 16

2112
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:40,492
YEARS.

2113
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,453
THE WHOLE THING SUNEVER GIVE UP
ON YOUR DREAMS.

2114
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:46,999
YOU BE CAN BE A 47-YEAR-OLD MOM
AND FREAKING DO THIS.

2115
01:40:47,082 --> 01:40:49,626
WHOEVER WINS THIS SEASON IS THE
REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL OF US.

2116
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:53,297
AND I THINK IF YOU VOTE ME AS
THE WINNER, YOU ALL CAN FEEL

2117
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:55,174
PROUD OF ME AS THE WINNER OF
YOUR SEASON AND SOMETHING WE CAN

2118
01:40:55,257 --> 01:40:57,134
ALL REALLY CELEBRATE.

2119
01:40:57,217 --> 01:41:02,973
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, VERY
HEALTHY, CANDID, CHALLENGING

2120
01:41:03,056 --> 01:41:04,141
FINAL TRIBAL.

2121
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:06,143
JURY, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A
MOMENT TO TAKE IN EVERYTHING

2122
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:08,270
THAT'S BEEN SAID, AND THEN WE
WILL VOTE.

2123
01:41:21,074 --> 01:41:24,161
>> Jeff: OKAY, SO 39 DAYS OF
"SURVIVOR" COMES DOWN TO THIS

2124
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:25,412
ONE FINAL VOTE.

2125
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:28,165
JURY, YOU ARE VOTING FOR EITHER
CHRISSY, BEN, OR RYAN, WHOEVER

2126
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:33,003
YOU THINK PLAYED THE BEST GAME
AND WANT TO REWARD WITH THE

2127
01:41:33,086 --> 01:41:36,173
TITLE OF "SOLE SURVIVOR" AND A
MILLION DOLLARS.

2128
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:41,011
FOR THE LAST TIME, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.

2129
01:41:41,094 --> 01:41:46,517
DESI, YOU'RE UP.

2130
01:41:55,108 --> 01:41:58,320
>> I HOPE YOU MAKE SOMETHING
BETTER FOR A LOT OF VETERANS AND

2131
01:41:58,403 --> 01:42:02,908
MAKE ME PROUD.

2132
01:42:13,126 --> 01:42:16,547
>> COMING INTO THE FINAL TRIBAL,
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANY WAY

2133
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:21,176
YOU WERE GOING TO PULL IT OFF,
BUT I'M ALWAYS ROOTING FOR THE

2134
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,053
UNDERDOG, AND I HOPE YOU WIN
TONIGHT.

2135
01:42:23,136 --> 01:42:29,142
GOOD LUCK.

2136
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:42,406
>> ALTHOUGH I HAVE MANY REASONS
NOT TO VOTE FOR EACH OF THESE

2137
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:48,370
INDIVIDUALS, I BELIEVE THIS ONE
HAS PROVEN TO BE THE ULTIMATE

2138
01:42:48,453 --> 01:42:55,502
SURVIVOR THAT I'M OKAY
REPRESENTING OUR SEASON.

2139
01:42:55,586 --> 01:43:06,597
>> Jeff: FOR THE LAST TIME,
I'LL GO GET THE VOTES.

2140
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:10,225
THANK YOU ALL FOR ANOTHER GREAT
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."

2141
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:13,312
AND I WILL SEE YOU BACK IN THE
STATES FOR THE READING OF THE

2142
01:43:13,395 --> 01:43:16,398
VOTES.

2143
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:53,018
<i>( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
>> Jeff: DON'T LEAVE ME

2144
01:43:53,101 --> 01:43:53,393
HANGING!

2145
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:54,144
LOOK AT YOU!

2146
01:43:54,227 --> 01:43:54,519
LOOK AT YOU!

2147
01:43:54,603 --> 01:43:56,146
OH, MY GOD!

2148
01:43:56,229 --> 01:43:58,273
ALL THE LOVE!

2149
01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:02,527
COCHRAN!

2150
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:07,324
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT!

2151
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:09,993
THANK YOU, GUYS.

2152
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:11,286
WHAT A FUN NIGHT.

2153
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,163
THE ENERGY HERE HAS BEEN
ELECTRIC.

2154
01:44:13,246 --> 01:44:14,331
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU GUYS.

2155
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:18,335
THANK YOU, REALLY, FOR ANOTHER
GREAT SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."

2156
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:22,631
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
STARTERRED OUT A LITTLE CAGEY,

2157
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:25,300
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, A SLOW BURN.

2158
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:30,389
>> AND WASN'T SURE WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN, AND THE GAME PLAY KICKED

2159
01:44:30,472 --> 01:44:31,640
IN.

2160
01:44:31,723 --> 01:44:32,849
THE GREATEST PARENT OF THE GAME
FOR ME IS WHEN SOCIAL POLITICS

2161
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:37,354
COMES FULL CIRCLE AND THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE VOTED OUT NOW ARE IN

2162
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:38,605
CHARGE.

2163
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:40,482
AND THE QUESTION BECOMES, "DID
YOU GUYS DO THE JOB YOU HAVE TO

2164
01:44:40,565 --> 01:44:42,359
DO," WHICH IS PUT THE RIGHT
PEOPLE ON THE JURY.

2165
01:44:42,442 --> 01:44:45,195
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR GAMES.

2166
01:44:45,278 --> 01:44:45,529
RYAN.

2167
01:44:45,612 --> 01:44:46,738
SUPER FAN.

2168
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:49,950
PLAYED WITH SUCH HEART THAT WE
LITERALLY SAW YOUR HEART BEATING

2169
01:44:50,033 --> 01:44:52,035
THROUGH YOUR TINY LITTLE CHEST.

2170
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:54,496
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
DURING THE LOVED ONE VISIT, YOUR

2171
01:44:54,579 --> 01:44:59,251
DAD CAME OUT, YOU WERE REALLY
OPEN ABOUT YOUR BOND AND THAT

2172
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:02,004
"SURVIVOR" WAS A SHARED
EXPERIENCE BETWEEN YOU TWO.

2173
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:05,048
BEN, YOUR BACK HAS BEEN UP
AGAINST THE WALL FOR A LONG

2174
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:06,008
TIME.

2175
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:08,010
A LOT OF TRIBALS, YOU NEVER
STOPPED FIGHTING.

2176
01:45:08,093 --> 01:45:10,220
YOU WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE
REASON YOU WERE OUT THERE.

2177
01:45:10,303 --> 01:45:12,305
WE MET YOUR WIFE.

2178
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:15,392
YOU CREDIT HER WITH SAVING YOUR
LIFE, LITERALLY, AND YOU ARE ARE

2179
01:45:15,475 --> 01:45:16,643
PLAYING FOR YOUR KIDS.

2180
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:21,231
AND YOU WERE ALSO VERY OPEN AND
VULNERABLE ABOUT THE FACT THAT

2181
01:45:21,314 --> 01:45:25,569
YOU WANTED OTHER VETS WHO WERE
SUFFERING FROM P.T.S.D. TO SEE

2182
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:26,903
THAT THERE IS LIFE AFTER COMBAT.

2183
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:29,156
>> YES, SIR, YES, SIR.

2184
01:45:29,239 --> 01:45:30,741
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STORY.

2185
01:45:30,824 --> 01:45:32,617
A WORK MOM.

2186
01:45:32,701 --> 01:45:34,453
47 YEARS OLD.

2187
01:45:34,536 --> 01:45:36,580
APPLIED FOR 16 YEARS TO GET OUT
HERE.

2188
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:40,751
YOU DOMINATED, SET RECORDS IN
THIS GAME.

2189
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:44,755
WHEN WE SAW YOUR HUSBAND-- YOUR
HUSBAND CAME OUT AT THE LOVED

2190
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:46,548
ONE, AND WE SAW A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SIDE OF YOU.

2191
01:45:46,631 --> 01:45:49,593
YOU SAID HE'S THE GREATEST MAN
YOU'VE EVER KNOWN.

2192
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:52,596
AND YOU SAID, "IT REMINDS ME
WHEN I GET BACK HOME I WANT TO

2193
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:54,431
PUT FOCUS BACK ON THE FAMILY."

2194
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:58,226
THREE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
REASONS FOR PLAYING, BUT ALL OF

2195
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:59,436
THEM GOT YOU HERE.

2196
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:02,314
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
SURVIVOR AND YOU DREAM OF

2197
01:46:02,397 --> 01:46:03,273
PLAYING, THIS IS IT.

2198
01:46:03,356 --> 01:46:05,942
THE ESSENCE IS COULD I ACTUALLY
LAST 39 DAYS?

2199
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,570
COULD I GET TO THE FINAL THREE
AND GET A CHANCE TO PLEAD MY

2200
01:46:08,653 --> 01:46:11,156
CASE THEY DESERVE IT?

2201
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:12,074
AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT.

2202
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:13,492
NOBODY CAN TAKE THAT AWAY FROM
YOU.

2203
01:46:13,575 --> 01:46:15,869
BUT THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE
WINNER.

2204
01:46:15,952 --> 01:46:17,579
IT'S WHY IT'S SUCH A GREAT GAME.

2205
01:46:17,662 --> 01:46:21,541
THESE ARE THE VOTES FOR THE
WINNER OF OUR 35th SEASON OF

2227
01:47:43,498 --> 01:47:46,877
AND DRANK EXPERIENCES.

2228
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,547
BEN WAS ON A MISSION, AND WHILE
OTHERS SLEPT, HE WAS OUT THERE

2229
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:51,798
MAKING THINGS HAPPEN, LOOKING
FOR IDOLS.

2230
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:55,218
HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD KEEP
A SECRET.

2231
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:56,553
LET ME GET HIM.

2232
01:47:56,636 --> 01:47:57,470

01:48:08,481 --> 01:48:10,400
>> Jeff: IT'S GOT A LOT OF
PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THERE.

2241
01:48:10,483 --> 01:48:11,067
THAT IS YOUR CHECK.

2242
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:11,568
THE REAL DEAL.

GAVE HIM A BIG HUG.

2249
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:26,082
LOOK AT THAT.

2250
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:27,417
39 DAYS FOR THIS.

2251
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:35,425
IT TAKES A LOT TO WIN THIS SHOW.

01:48:35,508 --> 01:48:40,639
ALL RIGHT, SO, BEN, BEN, COME IN
HERE.

SO, YOU KNOW, YOUR HUSBAND LEFT,
YOUR SON LEFT FOR SIX WEEKS.

2255
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:48,355
IT'S A LONG TIME.

01:48:48,438 --> 01:48:50,232
YOU HAVE TO MANAGE THE FORT AT
HOME.

2257
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:51,608
HE'S OUT HERE DOING HIS THING.

2258
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:54,611
ALL THE PLAYERS WHO HAVE EVER
PLAYED KNOW HOW TOUGH IT IS.

2259
01:48:54,694 --> 01:48:57,781
BUT WHEN YOU WATCH THIS SHOW
OVER THIS LONG, YOU REALLY CAN

>> BEN IS LIKE THE BAD GUY IN
ANY HORROR MOVIE-- HE KEEPS

2327
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:50,453
COMING BACK TO LIFE.

2328

YOU THINK I'M GOING HOME?

2332
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:57,877
WATCH THIS!

2333
01:51:57,961 --> 01:52:04,968
( WHISTLES )
( EXPLOSION )

2334
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:06,219
LA-LA-LA.

2335
01:52:06,302 --> 01:52:11,307
>> Jeff: WITH NO MORE IDOLS IN
THE THE GAME... SOMETHING IS NOT

2336
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:12,475
RIGHT.

2337
01:52:12,559 --> 01:52:15,687
BEN LOST THE FINAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE TO HIS FORMER ALLY,

2338
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:16,479
CHRISSY.

2339
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:17,439
>> A MILLION DOLLARS WAS AT
STAKE.

2340
01:52:17,522 --> 01:52:19,023
I JUST LET IT SLIP AWAY.

2341
01:52:19,107 --> 01:52:22,318
>> Jeff: BUT A NEW TWIST IN
THE GAME GAVE BEN ONE LAST SHOT

2342
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:24,195
TO MAKE IT TO THE FINAL THREE.

2343
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:25,989
>> Jeff: BEN WINS!

2344
01:52:26,072 --> 01:52:27,365
BEN SEIZED THE MOMENT.

2345
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:31,494
AND ON DAY 39, FACED HIS FINAL
OBSTACLE-- THE JURY.

2346
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:35,331
>> I NEVER QUIT LOOKING, AND I
NEVER QUIT BATTLING AGAINST ALL

2347
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:35,832
OF YOU ALL.

2348
01:52:35,915 --> 01:52:38,001
I WAS NOT PUT HERE.

2349
01:52:38,084 --> 01:52:38,960
I GOT MYSELF HERE.

2350
01:52:39,043 --> 01:52:41,838
>> MAKE SOMETHING BETTER FOR A
LOT OF VETERANS.

2351
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:42,380
<i>( APPLAUSE ).</i>

2352
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:43,131
>> Jeff: THERE GU!

2353
01:52:43,214 --> 01:52:45,508
THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES.

2354
01:52:45,592 --> 01:52:50,180
WATCHING THAT BACK, DO YOU
REMEMBER HOW ARDUOUS THE JOURNEY

2355
01:52:50,263 --> 01:52:50,847
IS?

2356
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:52,348
>> OH, IT WAS-- IT WAS SO HARD.

2357
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:54,350
HAVING, YOU KNOW, MY BACK UP
AGAINST THE WALL.

2358
01:52:54,434 --> 01:52:58,396
I HAD TO FIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY,
EVERY MORNING, EVERY NIGHT.

2359
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,190
>> Jeff: YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT
THAT.

2360
01:53:00,273 --> 01:53:03,193
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE
ASK ME A LOT IS FINDING IDOLS.

2361
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:06,529
HOW DO YOU KEEP FINDING IDOLS?

2362
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:09,199
WILL YOU PUT IN PERSPECTIVE YOU
WERE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND

2363
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:10,074
LOOKING.

2364
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:11,034
>> YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND FIND
THE IDOL.

2365
01:53:11,117 --> 01:53:13,745
IF YOU'RE NOT LOOK FOR IT, YOU
WON'T FIND IT.

2366
01:53:13,828 --> 01:53:16,498
EVERY MORNING I WENT OUT AND
LOOKED FOR THE IDOL, AND I NEVER

2367
01:53:16,581 --> 01:53:17,665
GAVE UP.

2368
01:53:17,749 --> 01:53:20,210
I NEVER QUIT, AND I WAS-- THE
EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM, I

2369
01:53:20,293 --> 01:53:21,169
GUESS.

2370
01:53:21,252 --> 01:53:22,045
>> Jeff: WELL,
CONGRATULATIONS, WELL EARNED.

2371
01:53:22,128 --> 01:53:22,962
>> THANKS.

2372
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:24,380
>> Jeff: REALLY GREAT HAVING
YOU ON THE SHOW.

2373
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:25,632
THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES.

2374
01:53:25,715 --> 01:53:29,093
IT WAS A CRAZY SEASON BECAUSE ON
ONE HAND, YOU HAD CHRISSY, WHO

2375
01:53:29,177 --> 01:53:32,138
WAS A DOMINANT FORCE.

2376
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:35,600
AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU
HAD PLAYERS LIKE LAUREN, WHO

2377
01:53:35,683 --> 01:53:37,936
GAVE AWAY HER IDOL AND THEN GOT
VOTE OUT THAT NIGHT.

2378
01:53:38,019 --> 01:53:42,565
AND THAT MISTAKE, BY THE WAY, IS
A NOD TOWARD WHAT WE'RE DOING

2379
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:44,901
NEXT SEASON, AND I'M SO EXCITED
WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING NEXT

2380
01:53:44,984 --> 01:53:48,947
SEASON, I CAN'T WAIT-- I WANT TO
GIVE YOU A LITTLE TASTE, JUST A

2381
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:55,870
FEW SECONDS, WHET YOUR APPETITE.

2382
01:54:04,837 --> 01:54:06,047
>> Jeff: OH, IT'S GOING TO BE
GOOD.

2383
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:08,091
WE'RE GOING TO CLEAR THE STAGE,
WE'LL GET SOME CHAIRS AND WE'LL

2384
01:54:08,174 --> 01:54:11,553
GET TO GETTIN'.

2385
01:54:11,636 --> 01:54:13,638
THED IS VIE LIVE FINALE FROM
L.A.
