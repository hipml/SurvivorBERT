JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor:

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Ambassadors from</i>
<i>both tribes were sent</i>

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,755
<i>to assess the two camps.</i>

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,923
SHII ANN:
This is great.

5
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,133
This is much better
than our shelter.

6
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:11,136
PROBST:<i> Shii Ann and Clay</i>
<i>visited Chuay Gahn,</i>

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,554
<i>while Helen and Ken</i>
<i>visited Sook Jai.</i>

8
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,431
HELEN:
Did you guys build this?

9
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,766
-KEN: Yes, we did.
-Wa-ho!

10
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,602
PROBST: The two tribes will
now live together on one beach.

11
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,147
The question is: which beach
are you going to live on?

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,398
-Looks like we're going
to Chuay Gahn. -Chuay Gahn.

13
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,483
PROBST:<i> Believing</i>
<i>they had merged, Shii Ann made</i>

14
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,569
<i>a plan with Chuay Gahn.</i>

15
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:28,570
I'm working a deal.

16
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,113
I'm voting Penny out.

17
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,365
Don't sink everybody else
and yourself

18
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,950
because you're pissed off
at one person.

19
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,452
<i>If she does turn,</i>

20
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,287
the rest of her life,
she'll be considered a rat.

21
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,288
PROBST:
<i>But at the immunity challenge,</i>

22
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,497
<i>the survivors got</i>
<i>a big surprise</i>

23
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,417
<i>when they learned</i>
<i>the two tribes had not merged.</i>

24
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,420
What I said to you guys
when you left is,

25
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,798
two tribes will live together
on the same beach.

26
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,635
<i>Sook Jai and Chuay Gahn battled</i>
<i>again for tribal immunity.</i>

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,929
-(cheering)
-Chuay Gahn wins immunity!

28
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,640
<i>Chuay Gahn won, sending</i>
<i>Sook Jai to Tribal Council,</i>

29
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>where Shii Ann found herself</i>
<i>in the hot seat.</i>

30
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,353
I have already found out
that some people

31
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,605
weren't being true to our tribe.

32
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,149
PROBST:
<i>Shii Ann tried to target Penny.</i>

33
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,485
SHII ANN:
Penny, you're manipulative.

34
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,528
I know that that's not
a pleasant word,

35
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,822
but it's the way that
you've played the game.

36
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,823
PROBST:
<i>But when the votes came in,</i>

37
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,159
<i>it was Shii Ann</i>
<i>who was voted out.</i>

38
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,704
<i>With both tribes living</i>
<i>on the same beach,</i>

39
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,831
<i>what strategies</i>
<i>will come into play</i>

40
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,292

BRIAN:
No, I got to see what's up.

44
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,285
Because if Shii Ann is gone...

45
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,371
I got to see who's coming
back to our house.

46
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,914
-TED: After we spanked them.
-BRIAN: Uh-huh.

47
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,207
TED:
You know what I'm saying?

48
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,084
-Yep. -And I can't wait
for them to answer

49
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,879
the question when I say... I'm
gonna ask them; I'm gonna say:

50
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,965
what made you vote off Erin

51
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,259
or what made you vote off
Shii Ann or whatever?

52
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,012
Just to see
what their reaction will be.

53
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,889
There is a lot of tension in
their camp, though, isn't there?

54
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,640
-There is a lot of tension.
-Oh, there is, man.

55
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,434
Like I said, if they vote off

56
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,438
Su Yi... Sin Jun...
they're not thinking.

57
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,566
-Nope. -Because she-she's a lot
more damage than Erin would be.

58
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,276
-So I'll be curious... -They're
making an emotional decision.

59
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,277
Correct.

60
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,446
Which will be a mistake.

61
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,454
PENNY:<i> Shii Ann</i>
<i>was plotting against me</i>

62
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,789
<i>to the other tribe, and...</i>

63
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,834
I thought she had succeeded
and I pretty much, you know,

64
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,794
had already said my good-byes.

65
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,130
The joke is on her
as far as I'm concerned.

66
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,132
I'm still here and she's not.

67
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,634
<i>I couldn't have been happier</i>

68
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,261
<i>to hear that it was tribe</i>
<i>against tribe</i>

69
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,348
because I knew, with Sook Jai,
I was still safe.

70
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,267
We're all four and
we're all strong and true.

71
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,310
Let's stay together.

72
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,811
Let stay true to one another.

73
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,854
Remember,

74
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,690
we'll still be competing
against this other team

75
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,484
in future challenges,

76
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,944

(overlapping chatter)

78
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,322

and thank you all very much

79
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,823

<i>and I would, too,</i>
<i>if I were her.</i>

83
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,329
She is definitely walking
on eggshells,

84
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,957

since the second we got here,

85
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,334
<i>so she has to, she has</i>
<i>to undo the damage</i>

86

<i>that's already been done</i>

87
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,505

Threatened you?

106
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,413
Well, she, she seems to claim

107
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,873
that you guys have
a deal with her that

108
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,417
if we got rid of her,
you guys were going

109
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,378
to pick us off one by one, so...

110
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,171
we didn't like to have
a threat like that,

111
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,589
so we voted her the hell out.

112

She what?!

113
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,217

-Yeah.

00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,643
Okay. I'll do it with you.

168
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,728
-Okay. Cool. Cool.
-No problem.

169
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,527
-PENNY: I would love
a cup of coffee. -Whoo!

170
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,320
You know,
the one thing I miss most

171
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,614
-is my cup of coffee
in the morning. -I do, too.

172
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,199
I love to wake up to that.

173
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,200
Kind of like stumble
in the kitchen

174
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,910
in the morning,
just get that kick in the ass.

175
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:33,911
All right, by God,
here I come.

176
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,163
PENNY: Right about now,
it's about that time.

177
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,332
TED:<i> For me, my observation</i>
<i>is it seems like Penny</i>

178
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,459
<i>is really going out of her way</i>

179
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,711
to be superly overly nice,

180
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,047
to the point where
it doesn't feel genuine.

181
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,884
It feels... it feels fake.

182
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,386
We were thankful that
y'all had a fire for us

183
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,555
-and some soup left.
-Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,056
There's a little dirt
on your nose.

185
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,559
JAN:
<i>Penny could be a threat</i>

186
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,561
<i>for anybody in this game,</i>
<i>absolutely.</i>

187
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,604
<i>I think she,</i>

188
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:03,566
<i>uh, uses being very cute</i>
<i>and very sweet</i>

189
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,444
to her advantage in the game,
and... why not?

190
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,071
It's part of her tools,
part of the package.

191
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,531
CLAY: Y'all,
who talks funnier, her or me?

192
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,242
"Like" is "lahk."

193
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,243
(laughter)

194
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,494
I'm just glad to know

195
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,081
that I'm not the worst one with
the Southern accent out here.

196
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,625
-Right.
-His hair's getting light.

197
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,251
It's between you and Jan.

-Oh...!

<i>Penny is a...</i>

200
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,090
cute, sweet little girl.

209
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,777
we all just kind of
cut our eyes over

210
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,112
and giggle, like, yeah,
there's a little bit more

211
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,739
of that butter
that's not working.

212

Oh!

213
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,285
My God!
Let the games begin.

214
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,831
I don't really start till I hear
that thing go in the basket.

215
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,917
I mean, I just want you to know,

216
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,502
don't feel pressure,
but you know

217
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,795
how I respond to it.

218
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,797
-JAN: Oh!
-(Ted laughs)

219
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,006

Damn, it's pressure.

220
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,174
One more time...

221
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,302
KEN:<i> There's definitely</i>

<i>with these people,</i>
<i>and there's definitely</i>

223
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,974
a strategic reason for those
people to get along with us,

224
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,309
because things
change real quick.

225
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,020
Once I get this, you know
it's over, right, Jake?

226
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,399
Oh, my God!

227

everybody today
I'm becoming Australian.

231
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,538

"no worries, mate" thing, and...

232

<i>-I'm not gonna think about it.</i>
-I'm killing that chicken,

233
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,125
and I'm getting
that chicken bowl.

234
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,210
I figure I helped
earn that chicken.

235
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,422
-I can damn sure kill him.
-You're right.

236
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,342
JAN:
Chicken Snappin' 101.

237
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,512
I see the yellow bananas comin'.

238
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,514
(indistinct conversation,
chicken clucking)

239
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:01,058
Is that dessert tonight?

240
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,852
Who wants a really soft one?

241
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,061
JAKE:
Here.

242
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,022
(indistinct conversation)

243
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,356
Can I pick somebody
to share that with?

244
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,191
JAKE:
Are we sharing these, or, uh...

245
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,735
-Uh, no.
-Would you like to share?

246
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,153
There's one for all of us.

247
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,988
BRIAN:<i> As much as they don't</i>
<i>want to admit it, as much as</i>

<i>we try not to admit it,</i>

249
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,991
<i>it's us against them,</i>

<i>Even though we're living</i>
<i>together and hanging out and...</i>

251
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,330
it all looks peachy,
there's a lot of phoniness.

252
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,498
<i>Everyone wants to start picking</i>

<i>slowly but surely.</i>

00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>I can feel it.</i>

255
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,920
I can sme... sense it,
I can smell it.

256
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,509
KEN:
<i>The cave smells of urine.</i>

257
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,844
<i>Chuay Gahn</i>

258
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,888
has been pissing
in the front of the cave.

259
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,015
So now the whole cave
is starting to smell.

260
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,225
<i>It's the piss cave.</i>
<i>Very nice.</i>

261
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,561
I'm surprised, with that sun
hitting that sand

262
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,563
and everything,
that it even stinks, so...

263
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,733
Well, it doesn't hit the sand;
it's right here inside the cave.

264
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,569
JAKE: Why don't they pee
out there in the sand?

265
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,196
I don't know, I didn't do it.

266
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,073
<i>I come here,</i>
<i>I lay down at the front</i>

267
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,449
<i>of their cave,</i>
<i>and I smell urine.</i>

268
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,617
It's like pissing
in your front door.

269
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,910
You know, you walk
in your front door,

270
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,911
you close it,
"Honey, I'm home,

271
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,871
<i>let me take a piss right here."</i>

272
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,289
<i>Animals don't even do that.</i>

273
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,083
<i>Animals are genetically...</i>

274
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,544
<i>encoded not to piss</i>
<i>where they eat.</i>

275
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,213
<i>And it's happening here.</i>

276
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,673
<i>I-I don't understand it, but...</i>

277
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,757
KEN:
It stinks, though.

278
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,093
It smells like under
the boardwalk in Coney Island.

279
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,761
<i>I do feel like a visitor here.</i>

280
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,390
Personally... I-I don't go
around pissing where I sleep.

281
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,558
They do, and just
for that simple fact,

282
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,935
<i>I can't feel at home here.</i>

283
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,728
He wants to go pee first.

284
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,939
CLAY:<i> There ain't nobody</i>
<i>peeing in the cave.</i>

285
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,109
<i>I mean, it smells like a cave</i>
<i>the whole time I've been here.</i>

286
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,360
<i>I mean, it's nothing like</i>

287
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,986
your living room
with the candles going,

288
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,071
that's for damn sure.

289
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,572
But it is a cave.

290
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,574
<i>You can't forget that.</i>

291
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,550
JAN: Plate washers, let's go,
let's go. Chop-chop.

292
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,514
But it's interest... interesting
to me, even after, uh,

293
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,099
being out here in the wilderness

294
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,184
after hundreds of thousands
of years, the girls

295
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,602
are still doing...
are very domesticated,

296
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,688
and they enjoy it,
which I think is great.

297
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,524
JAKE: Yeah, 'cause I told 'em
I'd be happy to do the dishes.

298
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,859
BRIAN:
Kind of resorts back to,

299
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,986
like, the good old days,
when the men just ate,

300
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,321
and the women did
all the cooking and cleaning.

301
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,323
-So... -JAKE (laughs):
You notice he's saying that

302
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,366
when they're down there.

303
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,118
BRIAN: Yeah, of course,
but it's very interesting.

304
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,079
I mean, it's a...
it's quite an observation.

305
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,333
-So it's four...
-HELEN: Four cups of flour

306
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,460
and one cup of sugar.

307
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,627
Only one cup of sugar?

308
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,337
Yeah, and a little bit
of vanilla.

309
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,714
And, uh, my grandmother's
caramel recipe--

310
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,215
that's pretty good, too.
You cut them

311
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,800
in these little, you know,
squares like this,

312
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,510
and you... then you fold up
the wax paper.

313
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,387
-No way I can do that.
-Uh-uh.

314
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,514
JAKE:<i> I like every single person</i>
<i>on the other tribe.</i>

315
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,183
<i>The only one</i>
<i>that drives me crazy</i>

316
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,518
<i>is Helen</i>
<i>with the constant recipes.</i>

317
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,855
You know, I've heard recipes
till I'm just green in the face.

318
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,523
Swedish almond bars.

319
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,025
You start out
with your cookie sheet,

320
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,651
you put the toasted almonds
all over the bottom.

321
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,403
Pour the batter on top.
Like, I'll sprinkle raisins

322
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,529
around on that.
I love raisins.

323
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,822
See, I'm not
a big raisin person.

324
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,824
-HELEN: Yeah.
-JAKE:<i> My God.</i>

325
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,868
<i>You need, I need to go</i>
<i>somewhere else when she starts</i>

326
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,871
that recipe stuff,
which is nonstop 24-7.

327
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,414
Cashew butterscotch squares.

328
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,249
-Ooh, that sounds good.
-Ooh, what are those?

329
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,918
Same type thing--
pastry on the bottom,

330
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,669
and then cashews
and butterscotch chips on top,

331
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,962
and they bake in the oven.

332
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,422
It's-- just is something
to cut into squares

333
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,883
and put in people's
lunch boxes and stuff.

334
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,220
-Got-dang, that incessant talk
about food... -Yeah.

335
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,347
-and recipes drives me
totally wild. -Uh-huh.

336
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,516
That's why I'm more
than happy to go out.

337
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,476
-Yakety-yakety-yak.
-Helen loves to just talk

338
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,561
-about the same thing.
-And it's all food.

339
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,397
I'm thinking, Jesus,
don't you girls ever just be?

340
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,649
BRIAN:
<i>Jake and I like to get out.</i>

341
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,067
<i>I'm kind of getting</i>
<i>a little bit of cabin fever</i>

342
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,653
<i>or, if they want to call it</i>
<i>out here, a little cave, uh...</i>

343
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,946
uh, cave fever.

344
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,405
I'm going stir-cavey.

345
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,407
(thunder crashing)

346
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,752
JAKE:<i> I'm very careful</i>
<i>with what I tell Brian,</i>

347
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,963
<i>and I think he's probably</i>
<i>very careful</i>

348
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,339
<i>with what he tells me.</i>

349
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,049
We're still two separate tribes.

350
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,724
Which one of our girls
do you think's the best-looking?

351
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,601
-Oh, out of Penny or Erin?
-Yeah.

352
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,562
I think Penny's got
a cuter look.

353
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,106
Exotic-looking-- she's...
she's a pretty girl.

354
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,649
JAKE:
<i>I'm trying to figure out</i>

355
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,818
<i>information from him, like:</i>
<i>who in your tribe</i>

356
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,946
<i>would you think</i>
<i>should be voted off first?</i>

357
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,282
<i>And he's doing the same thing</i>
<i>to me all the time.</i>

358
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,783
<i>And part of the time,</i>

359
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,451
we're telling each other
the truth,

360
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,121
and part of the time, we're
kind of fudging a little bit.

361
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,455
But, you know, we're building

362
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,291
<i>a confidence with one another,</i>

363
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,293
<i>and once that confidence</i>
<i>is built,</i>

364
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,295
<i>then I think we'll</i>
<i>be able to...</i>

365
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,171
form an alliance of sorts.

366
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,842
BRIAN:<i> Jake, he might be</i>
<i>picking my brain a little bit,</i>

367
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,969
<i>but I'm not, uh,</i>
<i>telling him much.</i>

368
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,429
He's always asking
a couple questions here

369
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,722
how I feel about the tribe,

370
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,348
<i>and he's kind of</i>
<i>feeling me out,</i>

371
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,977
<i>and I'm not giving him</i>
<i>anything-- at least not yet.</i>

372
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,325
HELEN: A cup of sugar,
half a cup of plain old cocoa.

373
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,701
You know, cocoa, not mix.

374
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,119
-Mm-hmm.
-Cocoa.

375
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,954
Then you're going to take
another cup of sugar,

376
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,664
and you're going to pour...

377
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,042
Brian-- he's a good guy.

378
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,501
Yeah, I like him.

379
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,211
I was going to see
if you wanted

380
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,673
to try to figure out
if we could make

381
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,300
you and I from this side,

382
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:30,429
and him and Clay from that side,
be the final four.

383
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,307
Well, uh, if you'll leave me
alone with him

384
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,976
a little bit longer,
I might be able to get to that.

385
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,103
-Okay.
-I might be able to.

386
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,981
But... I'm just not sure.

387
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,399
Yeah, don't be.

388
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,318
Don't believe
everything he says.

389
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,653
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not.

390
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,488
Just remember,
he's a used car dealer.

391
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,656
Mm-hmm.

392
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,324
What do they sell?
They sell lemons.

393
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,035
-Mm-hmm.
-Be careful.

394
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,920
JAN:
Treemail, children!

395
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,588
JAKE:
Treemail!

396
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,882
You guys are going
to go bonkers over this.

397
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,550
-Holy...
-What is that?

398
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,927
That looks to me

399
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,845
like the immunity idol
in that... inside that...

400
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,764
-Inside.
-Looks like a genie

401
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,598
-in a crystal ball.
-Wow.

402
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,892
JAKE:
"How you deal with adversity

403
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,353
"will show who copes the best.

404
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,063
"Anyone can shine
when it's easy,

405
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,691
"but how do you deal
with stress?

406
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,611
"No physical strength required,
or power from your brain.

407
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,949
All you need for this one
is the desire to win this game."

408
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,283
Wow.

409
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,119
JAKE:
<i>Sook Jai really needs to win</i>

410
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,620
<i>this immunity challenge bad.</i>

411
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,289
<i>I mean, if we could</i>
<i>possibly win this one,</i>

412
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,249
that would put us back

413
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,418
on an equal footing
with the other tribe.

414
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,382
(screeches)

415
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,772
First things first-- Brian.

416
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,651
Take back the immunity idol.

417
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,447
Today's challenge
is for immunity,

418
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,742
and it's going to test
your ability to remain calm

419
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,453
when your instincts
tell you to panic.

420
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,748
We've constructed eight
individual bamboo snorkels.

421
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,458
You'll take a deep breath,

422
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,502
go underwater, get your mouth
around the snorkel piece,

423
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,631
blow out the water
and then begin normal breathing.

424
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,091
So, in theory,
you should be able

425
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,801
to stay down there
for a long time,

426
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,180
but for some of you,
those first few breaths

427
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,973
are going to be cause for panic.

428
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,476
These snorkels
are not traditional snorkels.

429
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,812
They don't have a mouthpiece
that has a good snug fit.

430
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,272
It's a piece of bamboo.

431
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,356
You're going to leak a little.

432
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,150
You're probably going
to swallow some salt water.

433
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,944
Once you come up
for air, you're out.

434
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,988
Because this
is a tribe challenge,

435
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,156
here's how we'll
determine the winner.

436
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,950
We'll take the total
cumulative time

437
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,328
for the members of each tribe.

438
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,581
So every second
you're underwater counts.

439
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,458
Three of your members
could come up right away,

440
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,335
and if the fourth person
stays down long enough,

441
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,669
you can still win this thing.

442
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,630
Chuay Gahn, for the first time,

443
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,632
you have more members
than Sook Jai.

444
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,467
You're sitting one person out.
Who's sitting out?

445
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,885
-Uh... Helen.
-Helen.

446
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,012
Helen, take your spot
at the front of the boat.

447
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,514
Everybody else,
take your positions.

448
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,057
Wait for my go.

449
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,685
Swim on out and take your spot.

450
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,695
This challenge could last hours;
could be over in minutes.

451
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,740
All depends
on how you handle stress.

452
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,076
Here we go, guys.
For immunity.

453
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,995
Three, two, one.

454
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,039
Down.

455
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,735
Penny's first up
at nine seconds.

456
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,702
(wheezes, coughs)

457
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,996
Ken, you're up at 15 seconds.

458
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,163
(coughs)

459
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,457
Everybody for Chuay Gahn
still down.

460
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,054
Clay, 20 seconds.

461
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,556
-Ted, you're at 21.
-Damn!

462
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,558
Jan, you're at 23.

463
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,226
Wow, that was fast, guys.

464
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,438
Erin, up at 25 seconds.

465
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,108
Only two people left
in the water:

466
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,986
Brian for Chuay Gahn,
Jake for Sook Jai.

467
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,779
Here's where we're at, guys.

468
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,615
Chuay Gahn has 64 seconds
underwater.

469
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,284
Sook Jai
has 49 seconds underwater.

470
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,121
That's a 15-second lead
for Chuay Gahn.

471
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,498
The only way Sook Jai can win
is if Jake

472
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,377
stays under the water
16 seconds longer than Brian.

473
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,464
Jake comes up first,
Chuay Gahn wins immunity.

474
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,751
PROBST:
Jake is up.

475
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,503
Chuay Gahn wins immunity.

476
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,421
Clay, go let him know.

477
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,675
CLAY:
We got it. We got it.

478
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,676
We won. You got it.

479
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,552
Yo, B, get out now.

480
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,139
CLAY:
You got it.

481
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,023
PROBST:
Who wants this?

482
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,358
-Brian!
-Brian!

483
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,609
PROBST:
Nice work, Brian.

484
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,027
-I'll take that.
-You earned it.

485
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,362
Another three days.

486
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,990
You guys are on a hot streak.
Congratulations.

487
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,742
Guys, I hate to be the messenger
of more bad news,

488
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,036
but another day together
at Tribal Council,

489
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,039
another member of Sook Jai
voted out.

490
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,374
Need you to swim off
to the beach.

491
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,613
(clattering)

492
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,410
(rummaging)

493
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,426
Got some food waiting for us?

494
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,886
I'm hungry, y'all.

495
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,429
I'm telling you, I am hungry.

496
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,931
Get out, before you come back,
you're just hungry.

497
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,600
It's like,
it's like leaving the house.

498
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,810
-You're just hungry, period,
you know? -Yeah.

499
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,354
Let's get some wood
on this fire.

500
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:45,113
Is there any reason why the lid
is off our noodles?

501
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,698
You're kidding me, right?

502
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,949
No.

503
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,744
Like, then they're dumped out
on the floor.

504
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,912
Here.

505
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,959
No. He opened the lid and got
into the real stuff.

506
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,503
Who?

507
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,922
-The monkey.
-Oh, no.

508
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,800
Did he knock it again?

509
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,469
All the bananas that were saved
for tonight are gone.

510
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,762
No way!

511
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,972
That's who knocked over
our, um... that's...

512
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,976
Well, I did think
that that was a possibility.

513
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,061
He came in here messing around.

514
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,021
They must be bringing
the whole family down here.

515
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,689
-Yeah, he scouted out
the area... -Oh, big-time.

516
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,982
The chicken feed was in...

517
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,110
they-they got
into the chicken feed, too.

518
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,820
-They got into it?
-The chicken's gone.

519
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,530
-The chicken's gone?
-No!

520
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,156
No, just the chicken feed.

521
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,992
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

522
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,994
HELEN:<i> Our monkey visitor</i>
<i>again has, um,</i>

523
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,956
<i>invaded the camp, and, uh...</i>

524
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,334
he ate the bananas
that we had left for tonight

525
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,795
that were just perfectly ripe.

526
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:45,006
Damn monkey-- I swear I'm going
to kill him if I get him.

527
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,466
<i>And then he got</i>
<i>into our noodles.</i>

528
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,884
<i>I mean, my God, that...</i>
<i>that's it.</i>

529
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,094
<i>That's our food here.</i>

530
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,805
<i>I have real doubts</i>
<i>that it's going to last us</i>

531
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,515
<i>the next</i>
<i>two and a half weeks, anyway.</i>

532
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,683
<i>With monkey claws in there</i>

533
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,018
<i>taking them out, uh,</i>
<i>it's not going to last.</i>

534
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,520
<i>-It-it's just not.</i>
-We got to eat.

535
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,397
Thank you.
That's... that's good enough.

536
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,690
-That's perfect.
-HELEN:<i> If he takes our...</i>

537
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,193
if he takes our noodles, we are
up the creek without a paddle.

538
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,113
We'll be eating rocks
or something, so...

539
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,665
If I'd have blown
that water out...

540
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,208
You got one shot at it.

541
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,835
-Yeah. -You didn't get it
the first time.

542
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,713
-You didn't have enough oxygen
to get the thrust, -Uh-uh.

543
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,590
because of the...

544
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,386
JAKE:<i> It's... it's really hard</i>
<i>on me today</i>

545
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,388
<i>'cause I'm taking this one</i>
<i>really personal.</i>

546
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,224
<i>I feel totally responsible</i>
<i>for the fact</i>

547
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,768
<i>that we're going back</i>
<i>to Tribal Council.</i>

548
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,687
<i>What I'd rather do</i>
<i>is just go off somewhere</i>

549
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,355
<i>and just be by myself</i>

550
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:46,568
and act... you know,
just be pissed off.

551
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,736
<i>But you can't do that.</i>

552
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,070
<i>I mean, you came back here</i>
<i>with the winners.</i>

553
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,238
<i>They're the winners.</i>
<i>You got to congratulate them.</i>

554
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,618
<i>You got to try not</i>
<i>to berate yourself so bad</i>

555
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,536
<i>in front of them, even though</i>

556
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,413
it's happening
underneath the core,

557
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,998
you know,
where you're just saying,

558
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,583
"Why did you do that?

559
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,044
Why did it happen
that way today?"

560
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,629
Win some, you lose some.

561
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,422
It sucks, but you know what?

562
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,757
(Jake sniffles)

563
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,218
W-Well... we can't go back
and change it.

564
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,928
I wish I could.

565
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,180
I... I wish I could, too.

566
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,391
This is how our fate
is determined, okay?

567
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,977
And we're a team,
and we said that

568
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,979
we were going to rebuild
ourselves after all...

569
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,439
all that crap with Shii Ann.

570
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,900
We have rebuilt ourselves,
but you know what?

571
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,944
We knew that this day
was going to come.

572
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,779
We knew we were
going to have to start

573
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,240
voting out people
that we didn't want to.

574
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,284
And it sucks, but you know what?

575
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,037
You got to be strong
in your heart.

576
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,831
Thanks.

577
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,958
And I don't blame you.

578
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,959
Penny doesn't blame you.

579
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,126
Ken doesn't blame you.

580
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,253
None of us blame you.

581
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,629
It's part of the game.

582
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,339
Okay.

583
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,132
It is not your fault.

584
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,592
-Okay.
-Okay?

585
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,969
You believe me, okay?

586
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,012
Okay.

587
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,185
(Jake sniffling)

588
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,116
BRIAN:<i> Well, we had another,</i>
<i>uh, immunity challenge and, um,</i>

589
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,784
<i>it's still</i>
<i>kind of weird, though,</i>

590
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,452
<i>winning and then having</i>
<i>to come back</i>

591
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,663
<i>and not really being able</i>
<i>to celebrate a win.</i>

592
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,707
<i>So you're not</i>
<i>looking too, uh... uh...</i>

593
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,458
uh, happy, because they've got

594
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,252
a major, disappointing
decision to make.

595
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,129
So that's
a very strange feeling.

596
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,630
-It's not a fun win.
-It's like a bittersweet...

597
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,173
a bittersweet victory,
you know what I mean?

598
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,050
-I think we're both cheated
in some way. -I know, 'cause I

599
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,719
don't want to say good-bye
to any of you guys.

600
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,678
And we're cheated...
we're cheated

601
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,806
because we can't really
fully enjoy our win.

602
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:40,765
-Right?
-Right.

603
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,893
Because we kind of like
you guys. You-you...

604
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,145
-you're living with us.
-It's sad.

605
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,354
You know, you guys

606
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,189
obviously can't be happy,
really, for us,

607
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,858
because of the decision

608
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,193
that has to be made
and stuff like that.

609
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,738
So... this...
this is a weird way of feeling.

610
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,489
You want to jump and holler
and...

611
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,866
and scream, but you can't,
because,

612
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,368
<i>you know, the people living</i>
<i>with you that you just beat.</i>

613
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,203
<i>And you don't want</i>
<i>to rub it in their face</i>

614
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,997
<i>'cause, you know,</i>
<i>that can hurt you later on</i>

615
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,790
<i>if one of them's on the jury.</i>
<i>But yet,</i>

616
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,375
<i>they were sad,</i>
<i>but trying to be happy for us.</i>

617
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,419
<i>And that's why we're just</i>
<i>having to tell them,</i>

618
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,879
<i>"Oh, we're so sorry</i>
<i>y'all got to go</i>

619
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,880
to Tribal Council tonight,"

620
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,883
but we were so damn happy,
it was unbelievable.

621
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,010
...we don't leave anything out,
too-- no coconut out, nothing.

622
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,803
PENNY:<i> This is the first time,</i>
<i>I think,</i>

623
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,890
<i>we've really actually</i>
<i>been able to talk</i>

624
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,725
<i>about how we're all feeling,</i>
<i>because...</i>

625
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,977
<i>now you've got four people</i>
<i>who are pissed off</i>

626
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,730
that we didn't win,
and you've got five happy people

627
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,859
who can't talk about how badly
they just kicked our butts.

628
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,362
<i>And when you're losing</i>
<i>all the time against them,</i>

629
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,322
<i>it's hard to stay upbeat</i>

630
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,991
<i>and keep your mind</i>
<i>off the game.</i>

631
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,916
JAKE: My personal opinion
is we ought to cook the chicken.

632
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,918
Mine, too.

633
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,961
I mean, they're going
to share it with us anyway,

634
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,755
but at least...

635
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,466
lets who brought it into camp
get a chance to eat it.

636
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,760
-Together.
-Yeah.

637
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,222
That's fine by me--
whatever you guys want to do.

638
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,266
This was supposed to have been
the final four. (laughs)

639
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,310
Well, it is the final four.

640
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,062
(laughing):
In our tribe.

641
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,440
It's the final four
out of the final nine.

642
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,692
Don't take it to heart, Pops.

643
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,111
Well, thanks.

644
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,071
I mean, look, we...
this is our fourth time

645
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,907
in a row to go
to Tribal Council.

646
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,243
They haven't been
the last four times.

647
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:27,580
So if I'm not here, I want
you three to kick some ass

648
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,165
and make them go
to Tribal Council.

649
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,917
I feel exactly the same way.

650
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,461
I mean, who knows
where this game's going to go?

651
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,797
The only thing I know
is this is our last time

652
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,800
for the four of us
to be together, and I hate that.

653
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:43,054
Maybe the four of us
should sleep together tonight.

654
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,726
That sounds almost... erotic.

655
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,019
(laughs)

656
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,063
I'm kidding.

657
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,691
Well, it's got to be...

658
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,359
you know,
it's going to get tricky.

659
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,446
Let me keep my relationship
with Brian.

660
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,823
And I'm trying
to develop one with Clay,

661
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,783
so let me try to keep them.

662
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,952
Y'all develop them how...
how you can.

663
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,663
Whatever we do
from this point forward,

664
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:11,499
just... just remember
that's where it is.

665
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,126
No matter what happens.

666
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,297
And no matter
what it looks like...

667
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:21,259
...our team's loyal.

668
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,261
We're loyal.

669
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,942
All right, we're going to say
a few words about this chicken.

670
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,155
This is Lucky, who's been
with us a number of days.

671
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,284
TED:
<i>I didn't grow up on a farm.</i>

672
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,869
<i>I'm not a hunter.</i>

673
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,413
<i>You know, I really didn't want</i>
<i>to see the process</i>

674
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,916
<i>of, uh, bringing Lucky</i>
<i>to the dinner table...</i>

675
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,710
because I was basically looking
at Lucky as... as a pet.

676
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,838
<i>And if it was up to me,</i>
<i>I would let Lucky go free.</i>

677
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,425
You know, in, uh, Buddhist
philosophy, the Dalai Lama--

678
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,178
he said, "This chicken's darma

679
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,057
is to give sustenance
to the rest of us."

680
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,558
CLAY:<i> You know,</i>
<i>I was raised around farms</i>

681
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,726
<i>and-and ranches, and...</i>

682
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,561
I've never seen such a ceremony

683
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,730
over killing a damn chicken
in my life.

684
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:17,732
<i>There's animals put on here</i>
<i>for us to eat,</i>

685
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:19,567
<i>and, uh...</i>
<i>hell, kill 'em and eat 'em.</i>

686
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,277
It's not that big a deal.

687
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,490
The chicken eats the grain,
and then we eat the chicken,

688
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,618
so with that,
we say to this chicken,

689
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,911
thank you for giving your life.

690
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,581
And we should have a prayer
of thanksgiving

691
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,293
at the time we actually eat
the chicken today.

692
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,255
So, chicken, thank you
for giving your life.

693
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,465
(snapping)

694
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,513
(chicken flapping)

695
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,847
(snapping)

696
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,893
(rapid flapping)

697
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,736
Now, that's just the last-minute
muscle twitches of death.

698
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,321
JAN:
<i>I had never participated</i>

699
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,283
in wringing a chicken's neck,

700
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,827
<i>and holding the legs</i>
<i>and watching it flap,</i>

701
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,955
<i>which was very hard for me</i>
<i>'cause I'm very tender-hearted,</i>

702
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,958
but it had a purpose,
and the purpose was to feed us,

703
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,626
so it was not a senseless death.

704
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,338
-Can I take these?
-Sure.

705
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,802
(sniffling)

706
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:31,514
Um, I'm burying
Lucky's head and feet

707
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,933
in my little pet cemetery.

708
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,769
JAN:
<i>I have a pet cemetery here,</i>

709
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,647
<i>and it started with Oliver,</i>
<i>the little bat that I found,</i>

710
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,149
and then, today, I added, uh...

711
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,318
uh, Lucky's head
and Lucky's feet.

712
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,654
I'll put them right here by
Oliver so they can be friends.

713
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,450
Of course, my team thinks
I'm crazy, but that's okay.

714
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,367
(sniffles)

715
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,661
Didn't know my cemetery
would be so active

716
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,788
while I was here,
but it has been.

717
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,125
<i>It was just to say</i>
<i>thank you and, you know,</i>

718
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,585
<i>"Y'all look after each other."</i>

719
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,338
<i>And so, of course,</i>
<i>that did make me cry,</i>

720
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,964
<i>but I'm happy they're together.</i>

721
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,008
(sniffles)
Okay, good luck.

722
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,217
There's more meat on here

723
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,011
than I thought
there was going to be.

724
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,680
Oh, my God,
that smells so good.

725
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,890
That broth
is out of this world.

726
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,099
Oh, yeah.

727
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,852
Man, Lucky really tastes good.

728
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,020
Thank you, Lucky.

729
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,688
I got a kiss from Clay Jordan.

730
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,899
Oh, my God,
am I queen for a day.

731
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,526
-Mmm. -No doubt. -We might
even have supper here, guys.

732
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,527
'Cause, you know,
if you guys are going

733
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,363
to Tribal Council,
you're getting back late.

734
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,909
You can either eat before you go
or eat when you get back.

735
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,166
(thunder rumbling)

736
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,505
Oops.
I forgot to yell, "Fore."

737
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,886
Here we are,
the final four of Sook Jai.

738
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,222
Somebody's got to go.

739
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,599
Nobody wants anybody to go.

740
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:01,729
Now, do we want to go ahead
and reveal who's going tonight,

741
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:06,734
or had you rather just do it
at the Tribal Council?

742
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,949
ERIN: It makes me sick
thinking about this.

743
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,617
It makes us all sick
thinking about it.

744
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,577
I mean, look how far
we've come together.

745
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:21,791
24 days, and we've all
been so close.

746
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,919
This is the real, true, hard one

747
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,212
-because I love all you guys.
-Oh, God.

748
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,547
-I love y'all, too.
-I love all y'all, too.

749
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,715
I'll-I'll tell you...
I'll tell you...

750
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,967
-anyone of you wants to know.
-I love all of you, too.

751
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,760
Wouldn't you know
it'd start raining when we get

752
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,138
-right here, huh?
-Good Lord's crying with us.

753
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,432
Yeah, he is crying with us.

754
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,058
Yo, let's get in
out of the rain,

755
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,728
'cause we're going to be
freezing later.

756
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,948
JAKE: If it was you,
would you want to know?

757
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,576
I think I'd want to know

758
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,996
'cause I wouldn't want
to be shocked.

759
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,458
-How about you?
-I don't know how I feel.

760
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,959
How about you?

761
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,961
I would only want to know
if everybody's

762
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:09,464
in agreement that that's
what we're going to do.

763
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,965
It's got to be unanimous--
that's how...

764
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,925
that's how I feel
about stuff like this.

765
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,387
PENNY: Well, let's just save it
for Tribal Council, then.

766
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,431
Yeah.

767
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,516
Is that the way
we're going to do it?

768
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,311
Tribal Council,
we'll just find out?

769
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,104
All right.

770
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,773
-All right.
-God, I love you guys.

771
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,776
-I love you guys, too.
-Love you, too.

772
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,279
You're special, special,
special people.

773
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,826
Oh, it just sucks
'cause this is the fourth time

774
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,662
in a row that we're going.

775
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,832
You know, you'd like to see them
have to experience this.

776
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,501
JAKE:
<i>It's tough</i>

777
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,838
when you have to vote
somebody off that you love...

778
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,007
and you've been through a lot
of stuff with.

779
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,967
And all of us feel that way.

780
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,304
Every one of us.
Every last one of us.

781
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,849
Thank you very much.

782
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,894
-Hey, guys.
-We'll see each other soon.

783
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,854
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

784
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,981
Good luck, Erin. All right?

785
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,191
Good luck.

786
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,152
-No shame.
-Okay.

787
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,529
See you a little later.

788
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,822
Good luck, everybody.

789
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,532
Very nice meeting
every single one of you.

790
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,325
KEN:
<i>I kind of laughed to myself.</i>

791
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,911
This is a game,
and I'm fighting back tears?

792
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,663
<i>I used to compare this</i>
<i>to Monopoly.</i>

793
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,039
<i>This is nothing like Monopoly.</i>

794
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,332
<i>This is amazing.</i>

795
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,876
-See you guys later.
-See you guys.

796
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,545
-Bye, guys.
-Bye, Erin.

797
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,879
-Bye, y'all.
-Later.

798
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,881
Bye, Penny. Bye, Jake.

799
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,393
-(sniffling) -Get this nice
little group hug here.

800
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,520
JAKE: Oh, you girls told me
not to do that.

801
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,522
(chuckling):
I know.

802
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,858
I'm sorry.

803
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,027
TED:
<i>I do feel sad for Sook Jai.</i>

804
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,237
<i>You know, at first,</i>

805
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,406
we were like,
"Well, hey, you know,

806
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,242
they're our competitors.
It doesn't make any difference."

807
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,702
<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>after living with them</i>

808
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,953
<i>and getting to know them and...</i>

809
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,790
<i>it is a sad reality</i>
<i>that one of them has to go.</i>

810
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,726
Welcome, guys.

811
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,437
I want to start first
just by checking in on

812
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,772
what it's like back at camp.

813
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,774
I'm wondering
if you're starting to feel

814
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,527
more like visitors, maybe,
than residents.

815
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,653
Ken?

816
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,948
Actually, it's quite the
opposite: I feel more at home.

817
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,743
Uh, each day that passes,
I think that the, uh...

818
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,120
the Chuay Gahn tribe
has been very gracious.

819
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,204
They've just been phenomenal.

820
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,166
They've accepted us
into their... into their home,

821
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,126
and now it's our home.
We're family,

822
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,128
and then, when we leave
to compete, we compete.

823
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,631
And it's-it's-it's...
it's amazing

824
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,716
'cause it humanizes
the whole game

825
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,593
because now this person
who I'm talking to

826
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,512
and laughing with
and singing with right now,

827
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,432
I know I'm going to be
competing against tomorrow.

828
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,184
Erin... diplomatic answer.

829
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,811
A little hard for me
to believe that there's not

830
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,814
some feeling of... of weirdness

831
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,276
in a game that is often
controlled by numbers.

832
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,320
-What's it like for you?
-We do feel

833
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,322
like a large family,
but the number game

834
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,491
is really starting
to catch up with us.

835
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,326
For the majority of the game,

836
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,662
we have had, uh,
strength in numbers.

837
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,330
Now we're the underdogs,

838
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,624
and Chuay Gahn does have
an advantage over us,

839
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,334
but they don't make us
feel that way.

840
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,378
Leaving for Tribal Council
tonight, they all walked us out.

841
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,213
They knew it was one
of the hardest things

842
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,464
that we've had to do.

843
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,008
They walked us out,
gave us big hugs,

844
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,678
told us all good luck and, uh,

845
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,055
you know, waved to us good-bye.

846
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,515
Penny, what's the impact

847
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,518
in terms of roles
or working around camp?

848
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,354
Is there any feeling in the back
of your mind that,

849
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,690
"I've got to work
with these guys a little bit

850
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,151
because I may need them
later in this game?"

851
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,236
I definitely think so.

852
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,531
Um, the first couple of days,
we were like visitors.

853
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,117
It was like being guests
in someone's home.

854
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,661
You had to kind of learn
how they do their chores.

855
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,746
How do they sleep?
How do they eat?

856
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,833
But, you know, now it's
kind of turned the opposite,

857
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,043
where we're all sharing
in the cooking

858
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,170
and the smashing of the leaves,

859
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,589
and now we're starting
to kind of team up

860
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,383
and pair up
with the Chuay Gahn members,

861
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,260
and I feel like
we're getting to know them

862
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,387
a lot better
than the first couple days.

863
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,389
Erin, why should they keep you?

864
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,765
Why not just
vote you out tonight?

865
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,225
I think they should keep me

866
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,436
because I feel like
I contribute to this tribe.

867
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,230
I feel like I have, um...

868
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,108
haven't caused any,
uh, turmoil or drama

869
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,568
or hostility within the tribe.

870
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,111
I've been true to my word

871
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,614
with each and every member,
um, of Sook Jai.

872
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,284
And I feel like
I'm an asset to this tribe.

873
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,118
PROBST:
Penny, how about you?

874
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,578
You could be
a threat at this point.

875
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,413
Even though we still
have a tribe game,

876
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,123
at some point,
I got to get rid of you

877
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,250
if I want to win this thing.
Why not tonight?

878
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,918
I help the tribe out.

879
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,087
You know, I-I do my chores.

880
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,630
I don't just lay around

881
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,091
unless we're all laying around
as a group.

882
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,594
I just don't go off on my own
and take little naps

883
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,387
unless the whole tribe is.

884
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,973
Um, so I feel that I pull
my own weight as well.

885
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,101
Jake, how about for you?
Three younger people--

886
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,312
"Let's turn on the old guy
tonight and get rid of him."

887
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,231
I'm probably the strongest
of the teammates in the water.

888
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,150
So from any... anything
that's got anything

889
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,736
to do with the water,
it's probably my bag,

890
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,280
and I think most
of my teammates know that.

891
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,199
I'm an early riser.

892
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,409
And I like
to get my chores done early,

893
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,119
and get everything
taken care of,

894
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,038
so, I think
I pull my own weight.

895
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,122
How about for you, Ken?

896
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,458
I think they should keep me
because of the fact

897
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,004
that I am physically
strong enough to get by.

898
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,048
PROBST:
Well, tonight's vote is big,

899
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,925
because whoever is voted
out tonight will become

900
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,551
the first member of our jury.

901
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,011
They'll have one
of the seven votes

902
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,473
that ultimately determines
who is the sole survivor.

903
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,141
They'll return to all future
Tribal Councils

904
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,309
to gather information,

905
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,353
and they'll be a part
of the final vote.

906
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,439
So with that in mind,
it is time to vote.

907
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,816
Jake, you're first.

908
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,370
This is probably one of
the most difficult votes

909
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,913
that I've ever had to do.

910
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,498
You've been a great tribe mate.

911
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,250
You've been a great companion.

912
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,019
I think
you've roughed it enough.

913
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,689
It seems like
it's beginning to wear on you.

914
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,365
I'll go tally the votes.

915
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,544
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

916
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,920
Person voted out will be asked

917
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,714
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

918
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,466
I'll read the votes.

919
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,930
First vote...

920
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,725
Ken.

921
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,395
Erin.

922
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:24,690
That's one vote-- Erin,
one vote-- Ken.

923
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,903
That's two votes-- Erin.

924
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,368
The eighth person voted out,

925
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,788
first member of our jury-- Erin.

926
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,333
You need to bring me your torch.

927
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,054
Erin, the tribe has spoken.

928
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,099
It's time for you to go.

929
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,100
Good luck.

930
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,560
I love you guys.

931
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,145
I'm sorry.

932
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,275
Bye.

933
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,626
You guys are
running out of members.

934
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,961
You're running out of time.

935
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,296
What you can't
run out of is hope.

936
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,132
Anything is possible
in this game.

937
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,135
You need to go back to camp,
try to get a good night's sleep.

938
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,553
Good night.

939
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,526
<i>Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

940
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,156
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor:

941
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,701
<i>reminders of home</i>
<i>strike an emotional cord.</i>

942
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,703
Oh ...

943
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,579
PROBST:<i> But for one survivor,</i>
<i>it could backfire.</i>

944
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,039
Brand-new cars in the garage--

945
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,457
<i>that'd be enough</i>
<i>to vote them off,</i>

946
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,750
<i>because they don't need</i>
<i>the money.</i>

947
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,461
PROBST:<i> And the scramble</i>
<i>to the finish line begins.</i>

948
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,922
They've been worried since
square one that I was a threat.

949
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,882
We've got to create
a little bit of a stir.

950
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,889
I'm very happy the way
that I've played the game.

951
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,975
My number one goal was
to make it to the jury,

952
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,184
and I made it.

953
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,520
<i>I wasn't predicting</i>
<i>to get voted off tonight,</i>

954
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:27,730
<i>but that's how the game is.</i>

955
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,816
<i>I came to Thailand</i>
<i>with a small bag and myself,</i>

956
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,819
<i>and I'm leaving with more than</i>
<i>I ever could have expected.</i>

957
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,321
I'm ready
to sit back now and watch

958
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,197
and see how the rest
of the game is played,

959
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,907
because it's extremely
unpredictable.
