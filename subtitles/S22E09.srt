1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,045
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,256
SARITA DROPS OUT OF THE DUEL.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,260
MATT SEIZED THE MOMENT, AND WILL
RE-ENTER THIS GAME.

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,930
AS MATT'S TIME AT REDEMPTION
ISLAND FINALLY CAME TO AN END,

5
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,140
THE TRIBES WERE MERGED.

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,934
BUT MATT WAS UNSURE ABOUT

7
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,144
STICKING WITH THE TRIBE THAT

8
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,939
VOTED HIM OUT OR MAKING A BRAND
NEW ALLIANCE.

9
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,900
ROB AND THE FORMER OMETEPE TRIBE

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,236
HAD A NARROW ADVANTAGE AT 6-5,

11
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,612
BUT RALPH, FROM THE FORMER

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,114
ZAPATERA TRIBE, HAD A HIDDEN

13
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,407
IMMUNITY IDOL, THAT COULD BE

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,117
USED TO EVEN THINGS OUT.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,452
>> WE PLAY THE IDOL AND THEN ALL

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,912
WE'VE GOT TO DO IS REEL MATT IN
AND WE'RE GOOD.

17
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,289
>> Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

18
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,583
CHALLENGE THE SITUATION IMPROVED

19
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,918
FOR ROB WHEN HIS
CLOSEST ALLY WON.

20
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,920
MIKE FALLS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

21
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,173
NATALIE WINS FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY!

22
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,383
AND WHEN HE FINALLY GOT ALL THE

23
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,093
ORIGINAL OMETEPE TRIBE MEMBERS

24
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,471
ON HIS SIDE, HE WAS BACK IN
COMPLETE CONTROL.

25
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,097
>> I DON'T WANT TO SWITCH.
I DON'T WANT TO FLIP.

26
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,599
IF IT'S GOD'S WILL HE'LL TAKE ME

27
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,641
AS FAR AS HE WANTS ME TO GO.

28
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,311
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, ROB
WAS THRILLED WHEN

29
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,812
RALPH PLAYED THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

30
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,522
IDOL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE KEPT

31
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,524
AND MATT TRUSTED ROB AGAIN AND

32
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,818
PAID THE PRICE, A SECOND
BLINDSIDE.

33
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,947
MATT, ONCE AGAIN,
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

34
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:13,656
MATT IS NOW HEADING TO

35
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,700
REDEMPTION ISLAND WHERE AT LEAST

36
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,619
ONE OF YOU WILL HAVE TO FACE HIM

37
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,287
IN A DUEL, AND I HAVE A FEELING

38
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,791
FORGIVENESS, NOT GOING TO BE ON
HIS MIND.

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,547
>> FIRST AND FOREMOST, I'D LIKE

40
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,256
TO CONGRATULATE MYSELF ON BEING

41
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,509
THE MOST NAIVE PERSON TO EVER

42
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,843
PLAY THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR."

43
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,303
FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU.

44
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,222
FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME.

45
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:43,144
SO I AM REAPING THE BENEFITS
OF MY-- MY SHAME.

46
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,732
I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT BLINDSIDED

47
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,317
TWICE BY THE SAME PEOPLE.

48
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,944
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE A MORON.

49
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,362
IT'S LIKE IT'S THE BIGGEST

50
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,655
PRACTICAL JOKE IN THE WORLD

51
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,198
THAT'S BEING PLAYED RIGHT NOW.

52
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,201
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

53
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,369
EXACTLY YOUR PLAN IS, BUT I TOLD

54
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,539
YOU I'D STAY HERE AS LONG AS YOU

55
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,707
WANTED ME TO, AND I GUESS--

56
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,960
I GUESS YOU WANTED ME
TO COME BACK

57
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,754
AND SAY, "HERE I AM."

58
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,422
I TRUST YOU.

59
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,174
THIS IS YOUR WILL.

60
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:18,721
YOU'RE USING MY STUPIDITY
FOR GLORY.

61
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,348
SO THANK YOU, LORD, FOR THIS

62
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:24,853
OPPORTUNITY AND BLESSED
BE YOUR NAME.

63
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,750
>> A VERY, VERY SMART PLAY
BY THEM LAST NIGHT.

64
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,919
>> DON'T SAY "THEM."

65
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,922
>> WELL, BY ROB.

66
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,300
>> THAT WAS, LIKE,
STRAIGHT MOB STYLE.

67
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,095
>> HE JUST ELIMINATED
THE WILD CARD ALTOGETHER.

68
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,889
>> I THOUGHT LAST NIGHT'S MOVE

69
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,598
BY ROB WAS GENIUS.

70
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,309
THIS WAS, LIKE, A HIT STRAIGHT

71
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,935
OUT OF A MOB MOVIE.

72
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,604
LIKE, THE GUY COMES BACK.

73
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,230
THERE'S LITTLE QUESTION ABOUT

74
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,607
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN
TRUST HIM,

75
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,108
BUT YOU JUST WELCOME HIM
BACK IN

76
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,068
AND YOU PAT HIM ON THE BACK,
YOU SIT DOWN

77
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,069
AND YOU HAVE DINNER WITH HIM

78
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,404
AND GO OUT ON
THE FISHING BOATS AND KILL HIM.

79
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:20,783
>> HEY, ROB?
>> YES.

80
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,119
>> AS MUCH AS I HATED IT.
>> YEAH.

81
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,121
>> IT WAS A BRILLIANT MOVE BY
YOU GUYS LAST NIGHT.

82
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,122
>> THANKS, MAN.

83
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,123
>> WELL PLAYED.

84
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,625
>> YEAH.

85
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,293
I APPRECIATE IT.

86
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,836
>> YEAH.

87
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,381
>> MAN, IT'S PART OF THE GAME,
UNFORTUNATELY.

88
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,341
>> YEAH.

89
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,342
POOR KID.

90
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,343
>> YEAH.

91
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,385
>> COLD-BLOODED, MAN.

92
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,096
FOR THEM TO SEND MATT BACK TO

93
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,349
REDEMPTION WAS JUST
COLD-BLOODED.

94
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:48,061
I MEAN, DO-- IT'S A GAME, BUT DO

95
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,896
YOU NOT HAVE ANY FEELING AT ALL

96
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,605
FOR A HUMAN BEING?

97
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,941
>> YOU GOT, LIKE, THE LITTLE--

98
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,319
>> SUPERMAN.
>> SUPERMAN!

99
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,320
>> SO, YOU KNOW, WITH PEOPLE

100
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,530
LIKE THAT PLAYING THE GAME,

101
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,406
THERE'S NO BREAKING
THAT BARRIER.

102
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,159
THAT'S HOW WE FEEL RIGHT NOW.

103
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:07,538
THERE'S NO BREAKING
THEIR LOYAL SHIELD.

104
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,207
>> WHAT'S THAT?

105
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,167
>> AM I ON THE CHOP BLOCK?

106
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,751
>> CHOP BLOCK?

107
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,670
OH, THE CHOPPING BLOCK?

108
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,213
>> AM I THE ONE THEY'RE GOING
TO SEND HOME?

109
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,508
>> OH, I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

110
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,052
WE DON'T KNOW.

111
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:25,348
>> HEY, IF YOU WERE IN
THE TOP THREE, I--

112
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,851
I'LL DEFINITELY VOTE
FOR YOU AND NOT BOSTON ROB.

113
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,020
>> YOU CAN TRY, BUT STILL WE

114
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,022
HAVEN'T TALK--
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

115
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,274
KIND OF POINTLESS.

116
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,861
>> ALL RIGHTY.
>> ALL RIGHTY?

117
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,698
>> IT'S A HARD--
IT'S A HARD GAME.

118
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,325
>> NOW SINCE WE'RE MERGED

119
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,703
WE HAVE NO CONTROL,
I DON'T THINK.

120
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,913
THAT'S VERY AGGRAVATING.

121
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,040
I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON.

122
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,834
THEY WON'T LET US KNOW NOTHING.

123
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,752
I MEAN, HOW CAN WE PLAY A GAME

124
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,879
WHEN WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START?

125
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,173
>> FROM HERE ON OUT WE DON'T

126
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,301
DECIDE WHO'S GOING NEXT
UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE.

127
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,219
>> YES.

128
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,887
>> WE'RE GOING TO DO
THE BUDDY SYSTEM.

129
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,848
NOBODY TALKS TO ANYBODY
ON THEIR OWN.

130
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,058
DON'T EVEN ENTERTAIN ANY--

131
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,603
>> NO CONVERSATION ABOUT US,
JUST THE WEATHER AND--

132
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,189
>> WE'RE GUARANTEED TO GO
TO THE FINAL SIX.

133
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,190
>> YA!

134
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,191
>> ALL OF US.

135
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,192
HERE WE GO, OMETEPE.

136
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,069
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, OMETEPE!

137
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,446
VOTING MATTY OFF LAST NIGHT

138
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,364
ACCOMPLISHED ONE MAIN GOAL

139
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,615
AND THAT WAS BRINGING THE OLD

140
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,243
OMETEPE TRIBE
MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER.

141
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,578
I HAVE A WHOLE VISION THAT I'M

142
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,748
TRYING TO PUT INTO ACTION HERE--

143
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,042
KEEPING US VERSUS THEM
MENTALITY,

144
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,877
THUS, THE SEPARATE SHELTERS,

145
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,587
THE SEPARATE EATING TIMES.

146
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,549
I WANT MY GROUP
TO HATE ZAPATERA.

147
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,760
IT'S US VERSUS THEM,

148
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,344
AND WE'RE BETTER THAN THEM.

149
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,929
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ARROGANT
ABOUT IT,

150
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,555
AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOW IT.

151
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,599
I'M NOT.

152
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,267
BUT I WANT THEM TO.

153
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,811
BECAUSE I WANT THEIR VOTES
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

154
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,774
>> WHO?

155
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,609
>> ASHLEY DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT RALPH SAID TO HER?

156
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,736
>> NO.

157
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,074
>> RALPH PULLED HER ASIDE
AND WAS LIKE,

158
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,951
"I WANT YOU-- LIKE, IF YOU

159
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,578
MAKE IT TO THE TOP THREE,

160
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,788
I'M VOTING FOR YOU."

161
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,499
AND HE WAS LIKE
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ROB?

162
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,960
AND SHE SAID NO,
HE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

163
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,545
>> OKAY, GOOD.

164
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,630
THANKS FOR TELLING ME.

165
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,591
THANK YOU FOR BEING HONEST.

166
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,135
SO NATALIE JUST CAME AND TOLD ME

167
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,512
THAT RALPH APPROACHED ASHLEY

168
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,722
AND SAID IF SHE MAKES IT
TO THE TOP THREE

169
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,307
HE'S VOTING FOR HER.

170
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,767
HE'S DOING THAT SO ASHLEY MAKES

171
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,022
A CASE TO NOT VOTE OFF RALPH.

172
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,108
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE
HIS ASS OFF ANYWAY.

173
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,734
OKAY. HE'S NOT GOING
TO VOTE FOR ME, RALPH?

174
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,654
HE'S NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR
ASHLEY,

175
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,948
BECAUSE SHE AIN'T GOING
TO BE THERE NOW

176
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,865
AND IT'S YOUR FAULT.

177
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,035
ASHLEY, YOU COULD HAVE
MADE IT TO THE END

178
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,663
BUT YOU DECIDED NOT
TO TELL ME ANYTHING.

179
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,332
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME EVERYTHING.

180
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,000
IT'S MY GAME.

181
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,253
I'M IN CHARGE.

00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,931
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

183
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,816
PHILLIP DID YOU HAVE
A COLLISION WITH A HAWK?

184
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,234
>> NO, I DIDN'T HAVE
A COLLISION.

185
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,862
I HAD A MEDITATION
AND THROUGH THE MEDITATION

186
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,488
I ASKED FOR A SIGN

187
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,698
AND OUT OF THIN AIR
APPEARED THIS FEATHER.

188
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,534
>> Jeff: LITERALLY
OUT OF THIN AIR?

189
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,202
>> OUT OF THIN AIR.

190
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,955
>> Jeff: SO ALL THINGS
LOOK GOOD FOR YOU TODAY.

191
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:36,831

00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:41,752

197
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,052
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO HELP ME.

198
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,471
>> I KNOW.

199
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,228

TAKE IN A MOUTH FULL OF WATER,

SPIT THE WATER INTO A BOWL,

209
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:16,996

ONE MORE GULP COULD DO IT.

00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,889
>> Jeff: CAN ROB DO IT
RIGHT HERE?

271
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,432
NO.

00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,739
GO.

278
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,033
YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THIS PUZZLE

279
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,577
FROM OUR VERY FIRST CHALLENGE.

280
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,912
WE HAD A LARGE VERSION
OF THIS.

281
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,081
SOLID COLORS WILL BE

282
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,375

283
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,918

ONE FORMER OMETEPE.

290
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,762
IT IS ONE MERGED TRIBE

291
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,805
BUT AS WE FOUND OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL,

292
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,808
THAT DOES NOT MEAN EVERYBODY
IS GETTING ALONG.

293
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,768
A WIN HERE WOULD BE NICE

294
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,144
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

295
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,938
GRANT DOING A NICE JOB.

298
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,235
>> COME ON, MIKE.

299
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,277
YOU CAN DO IT, MAN.

300
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,278
>> JUST FOCUS.

301
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,279
YOU GOT IT.

302
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,406

00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,292
>> WORK IT, GRANT.

311
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:50,876
>> Jeff: GRANT THINKS HE HAS IT.

312
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,878
>> YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

313
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,633
>> Jeff: GRANT WINS IMMUNITY!

314
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,513
>> I'M HORRIBLE AT THOSE THINGS.

315
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:06,809
>> Jeff: GRANT, COME ON OVER.

AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY

323
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,658
WILL BE SENT
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

324
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,160
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

325
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,036
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

326
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,348
>> TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

327
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,476
WAS SO CLOSE, SO CLOSE.

328
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,352
IT WAS, LIKE, WELL, YOU KNOW,

329
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,062
PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR TRIBAL COUNCIL.

330
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,398
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE
OF THE FIVE OF US TONIGHT

331
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,526
UNLESS WE CAN PULL OFF
A MIRACLE, A HAIL MARY.

332
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,113
>> I WAS LOOKING AT YOU.

333
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,656
( LAUGHTER )

334
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,033
>> LET'S GO JUST JUMP IN
AND CRASH THEIR PARTY.

335
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,577
>> I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

336
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,166
>> WHY HAS THE FLAGPOLE MOVED?

337
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,292
>> I DON'T KNOW.

338
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,001
IT COULD BE A HIDDEN IDOL.

339
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,212
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE ALL

340
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,880
PREPARING TO POTENTIALLY GO
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

341
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,883
WE TOSSED AROUND THE IDEA

342
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,927
OF TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN WOO

343
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,638
SOME OF THE OMETEPE TRIBE,

344
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,557
BUT ROB'S GOT THEM
ON SUCH LOCKDOWN.

345
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,017
I MEAN, HE'S LIKE THE--

346
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,144
HE'S LIKE THE PRISON GUARD.

347
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,105
>> THEY'RE DIGGING AT THE FLAG.

348
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,232
LET'S GO DIG.

349
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,233
COME ON.

350
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,234
>> WHAT?

351
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,236
>> COME ON, COME ON!

352
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,738
>> OH, THEY'RE COVERING IT
BACK UP!

353
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,950
>> THEY'RE COMING BACK.

354
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,036
>> LET'S SCREW WITH THEM.

355
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,375
>> WHAT ARE WE DIGGING?

356
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,088
I THINK WE INTERRUPTED
SOMETHING.

357
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,090
>> WE WERE JUST LOOKING
FOR ROCKS.

358
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,466
>> ROCKS?

359
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,592
>> I FOUND A COUPLE.

360
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,927
>> THERE ARE ROCKS OVER THERE.

361
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,720
ALL YOU CAN EAT ROCKS.

362
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,268
>> WE'LL STAND BACK AND WATCH.

363
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,853
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO
UNTIL WE HIT WATER.

364
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,272
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET IT.

365
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,439
>> YUP.

366
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,441
>> IMMEDIATELY UPON RETURNING

367
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,068
FROM THE CHALLENGE, MIKE AND I

368
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:21,986
DECIDED TO LOOK UNDER THE FLAG.

369
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,780
WE HAD A THOUGHT THAT MAYBE

370
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,490
AN IDOL HAD BEEN PLACED THERE.

371
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,450
BUT THE MURLONIO CRIME SYNDICATE

372
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,285
DECIDE TO GET SHOVELS OUT

373
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,621
AND DUG A FEW FEET DEEP
AROUND THE AREA.

374
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,583
BY THAT POINT IN TIME WE HAD

375
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,001
PRETTY MUCH COME
TO THE CONCLUSION

376
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,752
THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.

377
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,753
>> ANYTHING?

378
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,754
>> NO.

379
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,880
>> NOT YET.

380
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,842
>> I THOUGHT THERE WAS AN IDOL
UNDER THE FLAG, THOUGH.

381
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,176
>> REALLY?

382
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,970
>> THE ZAPATERA TRIBE
COULD REALLY USE IT.

383
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,015
>> THEY CAME RUNNING BACK,
GRABBED SHOVELS.

384
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,225
THEY THOUGHT WE WERE LOOKING
FOR AN IDOL,

385
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,143
AND I THINK ROB THINKS
TO SOME DEGREE

386
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,186
THAT WE MAY HAVE
FOUND IT BEFORE--

387
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,149
BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO GET
BACK WITH THE SHOVELS.

388
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,151
WELL, WE TRIED.

389
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,699
>> HERE'S THE THING--

390
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,159
I STILL CAN'T SHAKE
THIS IDOL PARANOIA.

391
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,119
LIKE, IDOLS ARE WHAT KILLED ME

392
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,038
LAST TIME AROUND, AND I'M STILL

393
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,165
STRUGGLING WITH THEM.

394
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,791
I KNOW I HAVE ONE IDOL.

395
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,335
BUT LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL,

396
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,002
RALPH PLAYED HIS IDOL.

397
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,130
SO I BELIEVE ANOTHER IDOL

398
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,965
COULD BE IN PLAY AT THIS POINT.

399
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,425
>> THEY'RE FREAKING OUT NOW
BECAUSE THEY THINK

400
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,343
WE MIGHT HAVE FOUND IT
UNDER THE FLAGPOLE.

401
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,219
ISN'T IF FUN PLAYING
WITH THESE CLOWNS

402
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,139
OVER HERE ON THIS OTHER TRIBE?

403
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,352
>> TONIGHT, WE BASICALLY HAVE TO

404
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,729
MAKE UP A VOTE THAT COULD

405
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,229
POTENTIALLY COST ME MY

406
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,065
"SURVIVOR" LIFE.

407
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,400
LET'S GO AROUND.

408
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,652
WHO DOES EVERYBODY THINK?

409
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,653
>> I WOULD GO WITH RALPH.

410
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,197
>> BUT WHO IS OUR BIGGEST THREAT
AT THIS POINT?

411
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,156
>> IT'S EITHER MIKE--

412
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,700
I WOULD EITHER DO MIKE OR DAVID.

413
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,702
>> DAVID IS STRATEGICALLY SMART

414
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,371
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

415
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,997
WHO IS GOING TO HAVE THE BEST

416
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,208
CHANCE TO BEAT MATTY
AT REDEMPTION.

417
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,584
>> MIKE.
>> MIKE.

418
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,251
>> NO.

419
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,462
DAVID.

420
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,130
>> SO WE HAVE TO PICK SOMEONE TO

421
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,298
VOTE OUT TONIGHT KNOWING THE

422
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,717
POSSIBILITY THAT PERSON MAY

423
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,052
ACTUALLY HAVE AN IDOL OR

424
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,887
SOMEBODY ELSE MAY HAVE ONE AND

425
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,055
GIVE IT TO THAT PERSON.

426
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,723
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES IN

427
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,809
"SURVIVOR" WHERE YOU
HAVE TO GAMBLE.

428
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,185
HOLD MY HAND.
HOLD MY HAND.

429
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,854
GET YOUR BUDDY.

430
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,106
>> I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

431
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,066
>> I HAVE TO GO, TOO.

432
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,568
>> WE'LL GO UP HERE.

433
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,862
>> I'VE GOT TO GO, TOO.

434
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,963
>> Jeff: SO, PHILLIP,
YOUR PREDICTION

435
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,089
THAT THE FEATHER
WOULD BRING GOOD LUCK

436
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,426
TO A FORMER OMETEPE MEMBER
CAME TRUE.

437
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,178
GRANT WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE TONIGHT AT THE VOTE.

438
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,304
YOU KNEW THAT.

439
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,765
>> MY GREAT-GREAT-GRAND FATHER,

440
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,809
A FULL-BLOODED CHEROKEE,

441
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,061
CAME TO ME IN A MEDITATION,

442
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,272
AND HE TOLD ME
THAT WAS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

443
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,274
HE ALSO STATED
THE FORMER OMETEPE

444
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,737
SHALL LIVE LONG
IN "SURVIVOR" LORE.

445
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,781
>> Jeff: MIKE,
THERE'S SIX OMETEPE.

446
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,783
THERE'S FIVE ZAPATERA.

447
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,493
YOU GUYS ARE IN TROUBLE
RIGHT NOW.

448
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,078
>> YOU KNOW, YOU COME INTO A

449
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,456
TRIBAL COUNCIL WITH
ZERO OPTIONS,

450
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,041
AND IT'S NOT A FUN SITUATION.

451
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,127
>> Jeff: JULIE, DO YOU LOOK
AT THESE SIX

452
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,629
AND THINK SOMEBODY
IS ON THE BOTTOM?

453
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,131
>> ABSOLUTELY.

454
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,466
IT'S OBVIOUS WHO WE THINK IS AT

455
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,593
THE BOTTOM
BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA.

456
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,303
>> Jeff: SO, THEN, DAVID,
OF THE SIX,

457
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,846
WHO IS ON THE BOTTOM?

458
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,431
>> WE THINK PHILLIP.

459
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,933
>> I ENJOY BEING ON THE BOTTOM.

460
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:40,476
IF THAT'S WHERE I AM.

461
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,478
IT'S A NICE PLACE TO BE.

462
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,313
YOU CAN LOOK UP AND SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

463
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,397
SO, IF SOMEONE SAID TO ME,

464
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,941
"YOU'RE THE GUY THAT'S ALWAYS
GETTING THE WOOD.

465
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,651
YOU'RE THE GUY THAT'S ALWAYS
FETCHING THE WATER."

466
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,445
GUESS WHAT, BEING ONE
OF 12 MEMBERS

467
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,030
IN MY FAMILY, IT'S FUNNY.

468
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,573
I DID THAT AS A CHILD.

469
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,575
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I HAVE A NEW

470
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,161
FAMILY RIGHT NOW
HERE ON "SURVIVOR."

471
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,206
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

472
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,374
>> MATT THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE HIS FAMILY, TOO.

473
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,671
>> Jeff: SO, RALPH,
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY IN,

474
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,341
BUT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST
BLOCKING EVERYTHING.

475
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,134
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP,
JEFF.

476
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,636
IF I'M STILL HERE
IN THE MORNING,

477
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,304
I'M GOING TO PUSH
LIKE THE DICKENS.

478
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,889
I MIGHT GET A FEATHER TOMORROW.

479
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:19,807
YOU NEVER KNOW.

480
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,017
>> IT TAKES COURAGE
AND DETERMINATION

481
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,727
AND KNOWING WHEN
TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE

482
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,353
TO GET A FEATHER.

483
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,980
>> OH.

484
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,816
SO YOU CAN HOLD
YOUR TONGUE, RIGHT, HUH?

485
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,358
>> APPARENTLY SO,
I'M STILL HERE.

486
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,401
>> GOD BLESS HIM.

487
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,986
HE MIGHT GO OUT ON THE BEACH

488
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,321
AND A WHOLE BIRD MIGHT FALL DOWN

489
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,699
AND GET A WHOLE BUNCH
OF FEATHERS.

490
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,700
>> Jeff: WOW.

491
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,537
MIKE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF PHILLIP'S FEATHER?

492
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,247
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S
AN INSECURITY THING.

493
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,916
I THINK PHILLIP IS STRUGGLING
TO FIND HIMSELF.

494
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,960
I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS
WHO HE IS.

495
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:48,585
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M JUST A GUY

496
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,088
WHO GOT A COLLEGE DEGREE,

497
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,506
BECAME A SPECIAL AGENT,

498
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,383
WORKING FOR THREE
SEPARATE AGENCIES.

499
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,093
I SERVED IN THE
UNITED STATES ARMY

500
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,427
AND HAD THE SECOND
HIGHEST MEDAL

501
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,637
THEY GIVE DURING PEACE TIME.

502
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,596
>> JUST GIVE IT UP.

503
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,764
>> I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE IT UP.

504
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,890
>> YOU SOUND LIKE A LUNATIC.

505
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,016
>> YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE?

506
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,226
>> AN EDUCATED INDIVIDUAL.

507
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,894
>> A GUY AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE CESSPOOL

508
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,063
STRUGGLING TO GET OUT OF IT.

509
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,399
>> PHILLIP NEVER CEASES
TO AMAZE ME.

510
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,025
>> KEEP BEING AMAZED

511
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,403
WHEN I SEE YOU SAIL AWAY.

512
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,238
>> Jeff: I GOT TO SAY,
I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA

513
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,199
WHO IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.

514
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,743
DO THE FIVE OF YOU ON
THE FORMER ZAPATERA TRIBE

515
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,079
HAVE ANY IDEA WHO IT MIGHT BE?

516
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,414
>> I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

517
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,125
IT WILL BE ONE
OF THE FIVE OF US.

518
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,920
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GRANT HAS

519
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,088
THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

520
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:33,755
YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR GRANT.

521
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,883
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

522
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,259
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

523
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,468
MIKE, YOU'RE UP.

524
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,488
>> PHIL, YOU ARE ONE
ODD DUCK, BROTHER.

525
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,057
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

526
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,982
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN

527
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,609
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT
TO PLAY IT,

528
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,945
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

529
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,492
ALL RIGHT, ONCE THE VOTES
ARE READ,

530
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,618
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

531
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,161
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

532
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,955
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

533
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,665

THAT'S THREE VOTES PHILLIP.

537
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,846
PHILLIP.

538
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,848
FOUR VOTES PHILLIP.

539
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,143

545
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,369

00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,500
FIVE VOTES MIKE,

549
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,961
ONE VOTE LEFT.

550
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,546
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

551
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,589
"SURVIVOR: REDEMPTION ISLAND,"

552
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,632
MIKE.

553
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,634
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

554
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,852
MIKE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

555
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,397
YOU'LL HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

556
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,774
WHERE YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET BACK IN THIS GAME.

557
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,152
>> VERY WELL.

558
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,657
>> Jeff: WELL, IT'S PRETTY
CLEAR THAT THE FORMER ZAPATERA

559
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,202
ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE
NUMBERS WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO

560
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,289
KEEP DIGGING, TRYING
TO FIND A WAY IN.

561
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,082
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

562
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,459
GOOD NIGHT.

563
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,090
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED

564
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,384
ONE MORE SURVIVOR WILL BE VOTED
OUT TONIGHT.

565
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,285
>> TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS
PRETTY INTERESTING.

566
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,828
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING I TOOK

567
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,247
AWAY FROM IT IS THAT PHILLIP IS

568
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,750
SLOWLY BECOMING A VERY LOYAL
SOLDIER.

569
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,752
WHICH IS GOOD FOR ME.

570
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,924
( LAUGHTER )

571
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,384
AND EVEN WHEN FACED WITH "YOU'RE

572
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,511
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK"

573
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,471
COMMENT, BY THE OTHER TRIBE, HE

574
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,516
RESPOND THAT, "I LOVE BEING AT
THE BOTTOM.

575
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,142
THAT'S WHERE I'M COMFORTABLE."

576
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,477
I'M VERY HAPPY THAT PHILLIP IS

577
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,603
OBEYING AND DOING AS HE'S TOLD

578
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,689
AND HE'LL BE REWARDED FOR IT.

579
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,326
PHILLIP'S NOT REALLY CRAZY.

580
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:31,952
HE'S KIND OF PLAYING CRAZY.

581
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,620
BUT HE IS A LITTLE CRAZY.

582
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:37,374
SO EVEN THIS EARLY, I'M STILL

583
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:41,336
THINKING ABOUT MY END GAME AND
THE JURY.

584
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,839
SO AS FAR AS PHILLIP AND I GO,

585
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,673
PHILLIP'S AT THE TOP OF MY LIST.

586
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,508
HE'S MY NUMBER ONE.

587
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,676
THAT'S ALL HE NEEDS TO KNOW.

588
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,346
SO NATALIE AND PHILLIP ARE

589
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,639
COMING TO THE FINAL THREE
WITH ME.

590
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,362
>> THANK YOU, SIR.

591
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:12,367
>> COULD YOU-- COULD YOU AND
ANDREA SHARE?

592
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,910
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

593
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,328
THANK YOU.

594
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,831
>> EVERYBODY THINKS PHILLIP IS
NAIVE.

595
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,832
PHILLIP IS IDIOT.

596
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,500
PHILLIP IS A CRAZY GUY.

597
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,543
THIS IS A GAME.

598
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,044
EVERYBODY WANTS TO STAND AT

599
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,338
FINAL WITH A GUY LIKE ME WHO HAS

600
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,673
BEEN POLARIZING, INSULTING, AND

601
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,760
SO KNOWING BOSTON ROB THE WAY I

602
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,678
KNOW HIM, HE'S THINKING, WHO CAN

603
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,222
I HAVE STAND NEXT TO ME AND WHO

604
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,308
DOESN'T LOOK SO PRETTY?

605
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,059
PHIL SHEPPARD.

606
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:38,727
BUT I'M A SMART GUY.

607
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,562
I'M A COMPLEX PERSON, AND I

608
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,772
GOTTA MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

609
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,733
BUT THERE'S A TIME FOR THAT AND

610
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,776
NOW ISN'T THE TIME.

611
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,070
>> TODAY'S THE DAY.

612
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,405
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

613
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,407
>> GOOD LUCK WITH GETTING
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK.

614
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,744
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.
>> OKAY.

615
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,745
THAT'S ALL I GOTTA DO
IS GO TALK TO THEM.

616
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,122
>> NO.

617
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,624
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACCOMPLISH
ANYTHING IF YOU TALK TO

618
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,417
ALL OF THEM.

619
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,710
YOU GET ONE SHOT. YOU GET ONE
TRY TO TALK TO THEM.

620
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,629
IF YOU DON'T GET SOME PROGRESS

621
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:09,007
ON THE FIRST CHANCE, THEN IT'S
OVER.

622
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,758
GOING OVER THERE AND RUINING IT
NOW--

623
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,927
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

624
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,970
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
GOING TO DO.

625
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,100
>> DON'T DO SOMETHING STUPID.
>> ALL RIGHT.

626
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:19,809
>> WE NEED TO GET THIS GAME
ON THE ROAD.

627
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,729
TIME'S TICKING.

628
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,064
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE ON TIME.

629
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,190
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME MOVES.

630
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,943
>> YOU KNOW, A TRIBE THAT STICKS
TOGETHER ENDS TOGETHER.

631
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,277
>> UH-HUH.

632
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,570
>> AND WHAT THEY WANT TO HAVE
HAPPEN--

633
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,112
>> UNTIL YOU MERGE.

634
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,948
IT'S ABOUT ONE ON ONE.

635
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,617
>> YOU WANNA WIN THE MILLION OR
YOU WANNA LET ROB WIN IT?

636
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,786
>> I'M REALLY NOT CONCERNED.

637
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,665
>> I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU,
AND NOBODY WANTS TO TALK.

638
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,458
>> THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK
ABOUT.

639
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,960
>> THERE'S A WHOLE LOT TO TALK
ABOUT.

640
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,461
THIS IS A GAME.

641
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,588
>> WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT
THE GAME WITH YOU.

642
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,297
IF YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR

643
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:49,965
STEERS AND HOW YOU STARTED YOUR

644
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,758
FARM, WE'LL BE HAPPY TO HEAR IT,

645
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,343
FOR A LITTLE BIT-- FOR A LITTLE
BIT.

646
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,177
>> I WANT TO GIVE YOU MY
OPINION.

647
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,971
>> WELL, WE APPRECIATE YOUR
OPINION.

648
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,180
AS MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO

649
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,266
SAY, OPINIONS ARE LIKE,
EVERYBODY HAS ONE.

650
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,934
>> YOU CAN TALK ABOUT LIKE YOUR
HOME AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

651
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,353
>> YEAH BUT AT HOME, WE TALK
ABOUT THAT WHEN WE ARE

652
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,354
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

653
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,022
THIS IS A GAME. WE GOT TO WORRY
ABOUT A GAME.

654
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,315
>> YOU JUST CAME OVER.

655
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,024
I WAS HAVING A PRIVATE
CONVERSATION.

656
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,651
MOST PEOPLE SAY, "EXCUSE ME."

657
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,486
ANYWAY, BACK TO OUR
CONVERSATION.

658
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,154
>> HE'S SO NUTS.

659
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,030
>> WHEN NOBODY IS WILLING TO

660
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,324
PLAY THE GAME IT'S NOT
A LOT OF FUN.

661
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,118
WE'RE JUST SITTING HERE TRYING

662
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,369
TO HANG ON AS LONG AS WE CAN,

663
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,413
AND THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT

664
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,791
I'M NOT ALREADY
THE NEXT ON THE LIST.

665
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,592
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

666
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,889
>> OH!

667
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:44,060
>> Jeff: THEY LOOK GOOD,
PHILLIP?

668
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,145
>> OH, YEAH, BABY.

669
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,187
>> Jeff: WELL, I'M HAPPY TO

670
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,398
TELL YOU THAT TODAY EVERYBODY

671
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,983
WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

672
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,319
FEAST ON CHEESEBURGERS.

673
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:52,694
SHALL WE GET TO IT?

674
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,737
>> YES.

675
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,779
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.

676
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,700
GRANT, TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.

677
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,036
>> MY GOODNESS!

678
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,040
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY

679
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,334
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

680
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,543
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU ARE

681
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,086
GOING TO HANG FROM A BAR FOR AS

682
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:10,920
LONG AS YOU CAN.

683
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,965
AFTER 20 MINUTES, YOU'LL BE

684
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,384
ALLOWED TO USE YOUR LEGS ONLY.

685
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,094
ONCE YOU DROP FROM THE BAR,

686
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,512
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

687
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,056
LAST PERSON LEFT HANGING WINS

688
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,391
IMMUNITY, IS SAFE AT THE VOTE.

689
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,726
LOSERS, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED

690
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,228
OUT AND SENT TO REDEMPTION
ISLAND.

691
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,438
NOW TO THE CHEESEBURGERS.

692
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,358
YOU'RE GOING TO EACH TAKE A
WHITE ROCK AND A BLACK ROCK.

693
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,859
TAKE ONE OF EACH.

694
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,944
INDIVIDUAL DECISION.

695
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,780
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THIS SECRET
UNTIL I ASK YOU.

696
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,954
BLACK ROCK MEANS I WANT TO PLAY.

697
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,791
I WANT A SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

698
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,584
WHITE MEANS I'M EATIN'.

699
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,211
EVERYBODY PUT YOUR PALMS OUT

700
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:51,961
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

701
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,589
EVERYBODY REVEAL.

702
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,550
ONLY TWO PEOPLE OPTING TO EAT.

703
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,094
PHILLIP IS GOING TO EAT
CHEESEBURGERS.

704
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,011
STEVE IS GOING TO EAT
CHEESEBURGERS.

705
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,431
EVERYBODY ELSE FIGHTING FOR
IMMUNITY.

706
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,809
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS AND WE'LL
GET STARTED.

707
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,068
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD AND GET IN
YOUR POSITIONS.

708
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,907
EVERYBODY LOOKING GOOD.

709
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,910
ALL RIGHT, THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

710
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,120
START EATING.

>> Jeff: THOSE BURGERS BETTER
BE GOOD.

00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,663
ROB IS FIRST OUT.

728
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:10,623
ROB WILL TAKE A SPOT ON THE
BENCH.

729
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,958
NOW HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO SIT

730
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,377

YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT.

734
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:19,591
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT DAVID,

735
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,926

THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE THE

748
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,046
DIFFICULTY QUITE A BIT.

749
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,839
YOU WILL HAVE TO LET GO OF YOUR

750
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,217

I NEVER WANT TO LOSE.

832
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,088
I ALWAYS LIKE TO HAVE AN EDGE.

833
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:31,259
I DON'T WANT THE ZAPATERA PEOPLE
TO HAVE IMMUNITY.

834
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,595
I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE ANY
KIND OF MOMENTUM.

835
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,432
I DON'T WANT THEM TO FEEL LIKE
THEY HAVE ANY POWER.

836
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,433
SO AS LONG AS SOMEONE FROM OUR

837
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,352

BRING A BASKET.

845
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,169
>> ARE THEY ALIVE OR ARE THEY
DEAD?

846
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,670
>> THEY'RE ALL DEAD.

847
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,130
>> IF THEY'RE DEAD, YOU CAN'T
EAT THEM.

848
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,339
>> THEY'RE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE.

849
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,633
>> NO.

850
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,302
>> THEY'RE NOT?
>> SEE IT?

851
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,095
IT'S LIKE RIGAMORTISE ALREADY
SET IN.

852
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:16,512
>> THAT WON'T HURT THEM.

853
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,263
WE'LL EAT 'EM.

854
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,432
>> OKAY.

855
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,100
>> HELL, I CAUGHT THEM ON THE
RIVER BANKS AND TOOK ME

856
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,852
THREE HOURS TO GET HOME BEFORE.

857
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,604
>> ROB IS TRYING TO TELL HIS

858
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,271
PEOPLE THAT FISH ISN'T ANY GOOD.

859
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,648
>> THEY'RE ALL SOFT, STILL.

860
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,357
THEY'RE ALL STILL SOFT.

861
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,610
>> I THINK ROB JUST DOESN'T WANT

862
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,278
HIS PEOPLE TO TAKE ANYTHING FROM
US.

863
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,823
NOW, IF ROB WERE TO CATCH ALL

864
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,992
THAT FISH, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A DIFFERENT STORY.

865
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,203
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FEASTING
OVER THERE.

866
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,956
>> OH, MAN.

867
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,832
THOSE BIG FISH ARE GOOD.

868
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,168
>> I'LL HAVE A LITTLE PIECE OF
THAT.

869
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,503
>> I'M HUNGRY, BRO.

870
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,296
>> THE FISH IS ALREADY
ROTTED AND DEAD.

871
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,341
>> JUST DON'T LET IT AFFECT YOUR
JUDGMENT.

872
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,718
>> YEAH.

873
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,844
>> IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE A DAY

874
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,304
TO GET THESE HUNGER PANGS AWAY.

875
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,014
>> HERE'S THE THING I'M RUNNING

876
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,265
MY TRIBE LIKE THE ARMY.

877
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,725
I'M THE GENERAL, THEY'RE

878
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,976
SOLDIERS AND THEY'RE ALL DOING

879
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,144
AS THEY'RE TOLD WHICH IS A

880
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,813
WONDERFUL THING.

881
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,230
>> GRANT, COME TASTE THIS.

882
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,356
IT'S AWESOME.

883
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,357
>> HOW IS IT?

884
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,317
>> COME TAKE JUST A TASTE.

885
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,735
>> AMAZING.

886
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,237
>> THERE'S NO FOOD OUT HERE, SO

887
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,405
I'LL EAT ANYTHING, NO MATTER
WHAT ROB SAYS.

888
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,699
>> THIS IS A GOOD ONE.

889
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,617
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NAME OF
THIS ONE IS.

890
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,869
I'M MY OWN MAN, I MAKE MY OWN
DECISIONS.

891
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,330
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A
DICTATORSHIP GOING ON.

892
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,208
>> GRANT, WE HAVE SO MUCH FISH.
REALLY.

893
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,377
>> HE'S BEEN INSTRUCTED NOT TO.

894
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,087
>> HE CONTROLS THEIR DIET.

895
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,005
IT'S AMAZING.

896
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,383
>> THE OMETEPE TRIBE WAS TOLD
NOT TO EAT THE FISH.

897
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,552
I DON'T KNOW IF ROB WANTS TO

898
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,386
KEEP THEM WEAK OR HE JUST WANTS

899
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,888
TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER THEM.

900
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,556
IT'S CULT-LIKE.

901
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,392
HE SHOWED THE POWER THAT HE HAS

902
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,977
BY JUST INSTILLING FEAR IN

903
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,687
EVERYONE WITH THE WHOLE MATT
SITUATION.

904
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,605
IF YOU GIVE ANY INCLINATION

905
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,107
YOU'RE WAIVERING IN YOUR

906
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,860
LOYALTY, HE'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF
THEN AND THERE.

907
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,445
SO NOBODY IS GOING TO CROSS HIM.

908
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:03,369
>> I'VE JUST GOT TO SLEEP FOR A
COUPLE OF HOURS.

909
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,415
I'M LIVING ON A CUP OF RICE, AND
IT'S GETTING REALLY OLD.

910
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,084
>> YOU KNOW, WHAT IT COMES DOWN

911
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,879
TO TONIGHT IS DAVID OR STEVE.

912
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,921
>> I'M NOT GOING TO LAST MUCH

913
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:14,463
LONGER, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

914
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,383
>> DO I ELIMINATE WHAT I

915
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,594
CONSIDER THE BIGGEST STRATEGICAL

916
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,888
THREAT IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW, OR

917
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:26,100
DO I GIVE THE OLD DYING T-REX
WHAT HE WANTS?

918
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,435
BECAUSE I THINK HE WANTS TO GO

919
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,729
HOME AND GET RID OF STEVE, IT

920
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,480
MAY GIVE ME A JURY VOTE.

921
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,940
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE

922
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,109
A MERCY KILLING IN ME FROM TIME
TO TIME.

923
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,153
HAVEN'T I?

924
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,461
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, SAME
FEATHER?

925
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,795
>> ABSOLUTELY.

926
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,463
>> Jeff: HAVE YOU HAD ANY
OTHER MEDITATIONS?

927
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,882
>> WELL, THAT'S PART OF IT.

928
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,010
BUT THERE'S ALSO, FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN 22 SEASONS, A HIGHLY

929
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,846
EFFECTIVE AND BEAUTEOUS

930
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,681
AND GLORIOUS OPERATION IN EFFECT
RIGHT NOW.

931
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,849
>> Jeff: WHICH IS WHAT?

932
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,893
>> IT'S CALLED STEALTH.

933
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,649
>> Jeff: STEALTH R US.

934
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,525
>> AND I AM KNOWN AS THE
SPECIALIST.

935
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,528
MY PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITIES:
INFILTRATE AND SUPPLANT

936
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:24,283
INCEPTIONS INTO THE FORMER
ZAPATERA TRIBE.

937
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,119
WE HAVE HERE, BOSTON ROB, THE
MINERALIST.

938
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,706
PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITIES --
TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR

939
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,958
CHALLENGING AND DEVELOP

940
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,501
STRATEGIC ALLIANCES THAT ARE
IMPERVIOUS.

941
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,211
WHERE'S GRANT?

942
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,629
THE DESTROYER OF ASPIRATIONS.

943
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,463
BETTER THAN KNOWN AS THE
ASSASSIN.

944
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,174
PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITIES--

945
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:42,635
TO GO OUT AND COMPETE DESTROYING
ANY COMPETITOR.

946
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,805
AND I FORGOT TO MENTION THE
THREE DEGREES WHO ARE HIGHLY

947
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,974
EFFECTIVE, FORMIDABLE, AGILE,

948
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,226
AND HAVE SUPREME ABILITIES TO

949
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,186
FOCUS THEIR MIND LIKE THEY DID
TODAY.

950
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,981
>> Jeff: WOW.

951
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:59,068
RALPH, PRETTY TOUGH TO BEAT
STEALTH R US.

952
00:37:59,151 --> 00:37:59,777
>> IT IS.

953
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,363
YOU RECKON HIS GRANDFATHER TOLD

954
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,157
HIM TO SIT ON THE BENCH AND EAT
HAMBURGERS TODAY?

955
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,201
>> Jeff: I GUESS THE ARGUMENT

956
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,996
WOULD BE DOES "STEALTH R US"
CARE?

957
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,831
>> I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR MY

958
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,666
TRIBEMATES KNOW WHAT I BRING TO
THE TABLE.

959
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,792
AND, YES, IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR

960
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,503
THEM TO SEE ME DO THAT BUT THEY
KNOW WHERE MY HEART IS.

961
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:21,382
TODAY I ATE AND I MAKE NO
APOLOGIES FOR THAT.

962
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,551
>> Jeff: STEVE, HOW ABOUT
YOU?

963
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,511
WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE SITTING
OUT TODAY?

964
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:29,640
THIS IS A TIME WHEN YOU NEED
IMMUNITY MORE THAN EVER.

965
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,100
>> IT'S JUST NOT MY THING.

966
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,351
I'D LAST A SHORT TIME.

967
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,561
SO I JUST MADE THE DECISION TO
TAKE THE

968
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,564
FOOD AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

969
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,733
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, DO YOU SEE

970
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,734
ANY OF THE ZAPATERAS TRYING TO

971
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,404
FIND A CRACK IN THE STEALTH R US
ORGANIZATION?

972
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,364
>> THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN

973
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,699
TO TRY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT

974
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,909
OUR ALLIANCE IS SO STRONG, WE

975
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,578
HAVE A BUDDY SYSTEM, AND IT'S
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE.

976
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,080
>> Jeff: A BUDDY SYSTEM.

977
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,416
>> THEY ARE NEVER ALONE, EVER.

978
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,293
THEY'RE ALWAYS WITH SOMEBODY
ELSE.

979
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,419
ROB HAS COMPLETE CONTROL OVER
THEM.

980
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:02,256
IT'S NOT EVEN A TRIBE.
IT'S A CULT.

981
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:06,344
>> Jeff: DAVID, AT THIS POINT,

982
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,928
EVERYBODY ON ZAPATERA'S GOT TO

983
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,430
BE THINKING ONE THING-- AS LONG

984
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,557
AS IT ISN'T ME TONIGHT.
CORRECT?

985
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,392
>> THERE'S THAT, DEFINITELY, BUT

986
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,477
AT THE SAME TIME, WITH THE

987
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,270
NUMBERS THE WAY THEY ARE HERE,

988
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,647
IT'S VIRTUALLY IRSURMOUNTABLE,

989
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,441
SO THE OTHER PHASE OF THE GAME,

990
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,276
REDEMPTION ISLAND, MAY BE A

991
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,903
BETTER TACTIC TO TRY TO ADVANCE

992
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,612
YOURSELF THAT WAY.

993
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:28,991
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, ANDREA HAS

994
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:29,658
THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

995
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,786
YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR ANDREA.

996
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,661
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

997
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,789
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

998
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,458
ANDREA, YOU'RE UP.

999
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,566
>> HOPEFULLY THIS WORKS.

1000
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,831
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

1001
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,714
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1002
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,675
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1003
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,678
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1004
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,641
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTE ARE READ THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

1005
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,811
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE

1006
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,687
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

1007
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,689
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1008
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,609
FIRST VOTE, ROB.

1009
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,531
ROB.

1010
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:52,950
ROB.

1011
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,494
IT SAYS, "PLEASE COUNT THIS AS
FOUR ROBS."

1012
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,537
IT WILL ONLY COUNT AS ONE.

1013
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,206
>> I COULDN'T HELP BUT TRY.

1014
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,169
>> Jeff: THAT'S FOUR VOTES
ROB.

1015
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,506
DAVID.

1016
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,135
DAVID.

1017
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,390
DAVID.
THAT'S THREE VOTES DAVID.

1018
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:18,392
DAVID.

1019
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:20,728
DAVID.
THAT'S FIVE VOTES DAVID.

1020
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,856
FOUR VOTES ROB.

1021
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,691
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT THE

1022
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,359
"SURVIVOR: REDEMPTION ISLAND,"

1023
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,278
DAVID.

1024
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,654
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1025
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:44,585
DAVID, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1026
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,086
YOU'LL NOW HEAD TO REDEMPTION

1027
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,254
ISLAND WHERE YOU WILL HAVE A

1028
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,756
CHANCE TO GET BACK IN THIS GAME.

1029
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,924
>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

1030
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,051
>> Jeff: GOOD LUCK.

1031
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,140
WELL, IF YOU'RE A FORMER

1032
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,600
ZAPATERA, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR--

1033
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,976
YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO

1034
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,728
FIND A WAY TO CRACK THE STEALTH

1035
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,772
"R" US ORGANIZATION.

1036
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,815
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

1037
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,942
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1038
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,109
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1039
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,153
GOOD NIGHT.

1040
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:23,540
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1041
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,295
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":

1042
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,297
PHILLIP TAKES ISSUE
WITH STEVE.

1043
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,840
>> YOU DON'T START NOTHING THERE
WON'T BE NONE.

1044
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,676
BUT IF YOU START IT, I'M GOING
TO FINISH IT.

1045
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,387
YOU NOW CALLED ME CRAZY.

1046
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,471
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOME

1047
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:39,348
WHITE FOLKS THEY LIKE TO TAKE A

1048
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,057
BLACK MAN AND MAKE THEM CRAZY

1049
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,142
WHEN HE MAKES AN ARGUMENT THAT

1050
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,602
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR.

1051
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,271
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT TO SAY
ABOUT THAT?

1052
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,273
YOU ARE CRAZY.

1053
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,446
>> THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN
REALLY FRUSTRATING.

1054
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,155
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME THE

1055
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,032
WHEELS START TO SPIN AND I START

1056
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,033
TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME,

1057
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,829
THAT THE BRAKES GET PUT ON IT BY
SOMEBODY ELSE.

1058
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,664
KNOCK, KNOCK.

1059
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,665
>> WHO IS THAT?

1060
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,166
>> DAVID MURPHY.

1061
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,418
>> WHAT!
>> YEAH.

1062
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,502
WHAT IS "SURVIVOR" DOING TO US?
I DON'T KNOW MAN.
