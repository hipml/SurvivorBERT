20
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,186

24
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,781
Over 300 people have tested

themselves in the most

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,618
difficult and groundbreaking

00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:20,413

00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,500
We have gathered 20 of them to

37
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,133
>> I'm a villain.

38
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,301
I think villains are smarter

39
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,386
than heroes because they don't

40
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,388

00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,766

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,767
to get.

43
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,768
It's a fact.

44
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,352
It's a proven fact.

45
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:28,064
Google it.

46
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,400
>> The Heroes are definitely

47
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,818
people I would rather play the

48
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,569

49
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,194
The Villains are the people

50
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,404
I've always been against.

51
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,657
So this is perfect for me to be

52
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,325
on the heroes' side and battle

53
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,368

54
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,121
don't like anyway.

55
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,664
>> I've been labeled things

56
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,791
like "She-devil in a blue

57
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,668
bikini," "The wicked witch of

58
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,586
the West."

59
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,629
"Man-eater Manthey"-- that was

60
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,797
my favorite one.

61
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,217

63
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,681
came to do the first time-- get

64
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,433
to the end and make the money.

65
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,851
So I'm definitely coming back

66
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,395

67
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,274
>> This time, I slay everyone

68
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,151
and trust no one.

69
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,110
This is my chance for

70
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,403
redemption.

71
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,989
>> I'm not in the shape I was

72
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,616
last time, but I still think

73
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,118
that I could hang in there as

74
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,579
tough as any guy next to me.

75
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:25,747
>> But these people are

76
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,790
smart, they'll get rid of me

77
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,791
right right away.

78
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,501
It's the smartest thing they

79
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,753
could do, but they won't.

80
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,422
They never do.

81
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,257
>> I'm almost a decade older

82
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,800
than I was the first time.

83
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,511
So to me, it's a test to see if

84
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,931
I still got it.

85
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,349
>> Last time I was mean, and

86
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,059
this time I'm meaner.

87
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,310
You know, I'll lie.

88
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,269
I don't care.

89
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,856

193
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,541
notorious of all time?

194
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,793
>> I'm still in awe that I'm

195
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,836
here with...

196
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,963
with all these great players.

197
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:49,797
Finally, I can play the game

198
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,299
with somebody that respects

199
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:51,882
the game.

200
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,093
>> PROBST: Boston Rob, you

201
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,178
proud to be seen as one of the

202
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,638
ten biggest villains

203
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,223
of all time?

204
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,475
>> I'm a villain?

205
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,060
(all laughing)

206
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:03,477
Well, it's all in

207
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,396
perspective, I guess.

208
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:05,855
It's how you see it.

209
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,774
>> PROBST: Rupert, a lot of

210
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,109
people have played this game.

211
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,319
>> Yup.

212
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,486
>> PROBST: You're still, to

213
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,488
this day, one of the

214
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,448
most popular.

215
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,699
>> Uh, it's, it's been

216
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,534
an honor since the first time

217
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:19,327
that I got to play.

218
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,746
And now when I found out I'm on

219
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,747
the Heroes' side, I tell

220
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,750
you, I love the game, and being

221
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,294
able to have this chance,

222
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,503
it's, it's an honor.

223
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,088
>> PROBST: Tom, another big

224
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,382
hero, played a very solid game.

225
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,633
A lot of people like you.

226
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,218
They were happy you won, which

227
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,054
isn't always the case with some

228
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,305
of our winners.

229
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,599
Stack up these two tribes.

230
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,600
>> You know, we kind of got

231
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,809
maybe some positive energy

232
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,311
going just 'cause we've been

233
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,021
labeled the good guys, but, um,

234
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,064
I also wouldn't assume that

235
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,440
anybody would stick with the

236
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,733
game-play that they had.

237
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,817
If it didn't work for them in a

238
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,693
previous season, I would say

239
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,694
that they might do a 180 on this

240
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,405
thing and spin it around, and I

241
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,366
think that could be from

242
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,367
either tribe.

243
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,493
>> PROBST: Colby, in your

244
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,827
season,<i> Survivor: Australia,</i>

245
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,413
our second season,

246
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,289
going back almost ten years

247
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,458
ago, you were so popular, people

248
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,502
were naming their children

249
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,878
"Colby."

250
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:11,462
(laughter)

251
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,380
>> Most of the ones I heard

252
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,423
about named their dogs "Colby."

253
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:14,882
(laughter)

254
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,758
So a kid's not bad.

255
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,092
I'll take that.

256
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:16,926
>> PROBST: What's the

257
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,886
perspective now, almost

258
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,179
ten years later?

259
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,430
>> It's taken me almost this

260
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,474
long to really get enough

261
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,060
perspective to appreciate it,

262
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,478
and this is, this is my third

263
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,813
time back, and it is,

264
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,730
it is humbling.

265
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,440
It's the experience and it's

266
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,566
the adventure.

267
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,527
If you're not fired up at this

268
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,027
point riding in on those

269
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,071
birds, you don't have a pulse.

270
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,447
>> PROBST: J.T., is it at all

271
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,949
intimidating, even within

272
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,783
your own tribe, when you

273
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,035
look around at who's

274
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:43,411
surrounding you?

275
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,036
>> It's definitely intimidating.

276
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,912
I watched these people

277
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,830
when I was in high school.

278
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,706
I was too young to apply for

279
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,333
the show, so I couldn't do it,

280
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,127
and now I'm out here competing

281
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:51,460
against them.

282
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,837
And I'm still a rookie out here.

283
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,422
I'm probably the youngest one

284
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:54,880
out here.

285
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,048
I feel like a young kid against

286
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,091
these people, but I'm ready.

287
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,342
>> PROBST: Anybody out here

288
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,052
feel they are on the wrong

289
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,887
tribe, legitimately feel

290
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,722
they're on the wrong tribe?

291
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,807
>> Oh, yeah.

292
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,141
>> What'd we do?

293
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,226
>> Yeah, what did we do?

294
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:07,768
>> What did we do that was

295
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,644
so bad?

296
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,311
>> PROBST: So pretty much every

297
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,646
Villain thinks they should be

298
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,021
on the Hero tribe.

299
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,273
(laughter)

300
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,816
Except Jerri Manthey, the

301
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,317
original black widow, still

302
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,487
owning her title.

303
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,655
>> I even got a black hat for

304
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,948
this season.

305
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,658
>> Is there a little symbolism

306
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,576
with her hat being black and

307
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,118
mine being white?

308
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,162
>> PROBST: Good versus evil?

309
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,955
>> It was not a mistake.

310
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,790
>> PROBST: Parvati, let's be

311
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,500
clear; while you did a great

312
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,084
job and were rewarded with a

313
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,046
million dollars, you led one of

314
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,257
the most notorious tribe of

315
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,383
women ever in the history

316
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,301
of the game.

317
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,510
You betrayed people left

318
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,094
and right.

319
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,637
You guys were responsible for

320
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,431
many, many blindsides.

321
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,849
Great player?

322
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,017
Yes, that's why you're here.

323
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,018
Hero? No.

324
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,020
James, from your two cents--

325
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,397
Parvati, hero or villain?

326
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,899
>> Villain.

327
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,191
(laughter)

328
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,193
>> PROBST: James is bigger

329
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:57,443
than me.

330
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,069
James is right.

331
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,196
>> I will fight him.

332
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,989
I'm not scared of him.

333
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:02,198
(laughs)

334
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:02,823
I don't care how big you are.

335
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,073
>> Uh-huh.

336
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,575
>> PROBST: Anybody here willing

337
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,201
to say that the sheer size of

338
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,952
James does make them take pause

339
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,662
for a moment?

340
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,205
>> Yes.

341
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:09,455
>> Yes.

342
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,750
>> I don't want to wrestle him.

343
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,210
>> Hello?

344
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,503
>> PROBST: James, anybody on

345
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,504
the Villain tribe

346
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,838
intimidate you?

347
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,507
>> It's the same story every

348
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,299
every time.

349
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,842
The talkers are the most

350
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,092
dangerous.

351
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,887
The ones who strategize are the

352
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,013
best ones at the game.

353
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,556
They-- bar none-- have won most

354
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,057
of the series, most of

355
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,642
the seasons.

356
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,226
>> PROBST: So you've learned

357
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:30,768
something in your two times

358
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,852
out here.

359
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,354
>> Believe it or not, I have.

360
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,063
>> PROBST: Going back to

361
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,105
when you were voted out with two

362
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:35,856
idols, one in each pocket.

363
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,566
(James laughs)

364
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,318
>> Yes, thanks for reminding me.

365
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,569
>> PROBST: Boston Rob, how big

366
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,071
a factor is size versus scrap?

367
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,033
>> I-I think that we have a huge

368
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,952
advantage over them.

369
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,078
Our women are clearly stronger

370
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,037
than their women.

371
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,957
And our guys can hold the best

372
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,791
of it.

373
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,250
>> Yes, yes.

374
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:54,750
>> I'm being serious.

375
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,292
>> You got the gloves, Jeff?

376
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,669
>> I don't see how they're

377
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,836
gonna be able to keep up

378
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,587
with us.

379
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,422
I love you, Colby, but, man,

380
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,091
you got the raw end

381
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,092
of the stick.

382
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:03,884
>> I'm so glad he's here.

383
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,053
I'm so glad Rob's back.

384
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,846
>> PROBST: So, Rob, nobody on

385
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,597
this tribe of Heroes

386
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,515
intimidates you?

387
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,100
>> I didn't say that, Jeff.

388
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,102
I just said I think that we have

389
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,645
the advantage.

390
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,564
And we're not gonna be busy

391
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,941
dealing with all the egos

392
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:19,233
over there.

393
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,318
>> PROBST: All right, well,

394
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,111
we're gonna see how you

395
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,738
match up right now.

396
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,322
It's time to get to your first

397
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,782
reward challenge.

398
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:27,908
Here's how it works: you will

399
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,536
square off two-on-two.

400
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,371
On my go, both pairs will race

401
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,123
out to dig up one bag.

402
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,625
Once you have the bag, you must

403
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,419
race back to your finish mat.

404
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,003
That's where it's gonna

405
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,004
get physical.

406
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,673
You have four people battling

407
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,633
for one bag.

408
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,718
To score a point for your

409
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,011
tribe, you have to be touching

410
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,430
the bag and your finish mat at

411
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,639
the same time.

412
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,099
First tribe to score three

413
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,559
points wins reward.

414
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,143
Want to know what you're

415
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,686
playing for?

416
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,270
>> Yeah.

417
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:56,478
>> Yes.

418
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,606
>> PROBST: Well, in addition to

419
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,732
the challenges being physical,

420
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,482
the conditions are gonna be

421
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,483
demanding as well.

422
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,069
Between the heat and the rain,

423
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,196
if you do not stay hydrated,

424
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,741
you will not last long.

425
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,159
Fire for the winner of the

426
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,285
first challenge.

427
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,746
Having fire ten minutes into

428
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,706
this game gives you a huge

429
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,332
advantage going into that first

430
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,750
immunity challenge.

431
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,168
You win that challenge, you

432
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,252
have momentum, you could ride

433
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,462
that all the way to the end.

434
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,172
I know it's worth playing for.

435
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:23,714
I'm gonna give you a minute

436
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,549
to strategize on your matchups,

437
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,052
then we'll get started.

438
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,098
All right, let's get to our

439
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,600
first challenge.

440
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,894
The first matchup is going to

441
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,187
be Stephenie and Cirie for the

442
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,482
Heroes, taking on Parvati and

443
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,441
Danielle for the Villains.

444
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,776
This is the lane you're going

445
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,193
Right where I am.

446
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,194
Just come to me.

447
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,111
Survivors ready?

448
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,698
Go!

449
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,284
There's one bag in this sand.

450
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,870
You've got to find it, and

451
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,497
you've got to get back

452
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,331
to your mat.

453
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:02,211
Danielle and Cirie did this

454
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,171
challenge in their season,

455
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,882
<i>Exile Island.</i>

456
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,884
They're now opponents in the

457
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,804
same challenge.

458
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,221
Cirie has the bag.

459
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,641
Cirie and Parvati going at it.

460
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,434
And it's physical quickly.

461
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,977
Danielle trying to steal it

462
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:19,269
from Cirie.

463
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,564
>> Come on, Danielle!

464
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,899
Hold onto it, Danielle!

465
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:24,525
>> PROBST: Stephenie and

466
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,193
Danielle now have it.

467
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,154
Parvati now has the bag for the

468
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,491
for the Villains.

469
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,243
>> Yeah!

470
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,622
>> PROBST: Parvati takes it back

471
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,290
from Stephenie, but Stephenie

472
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,420
takes Parvati down.

473
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,212
Cirie in on it.

474
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,256
Cirie now and Danielle.

475
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,007
Cirie is like a linebacker in

476
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,383
this challenge.

477
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,260
Parvati working Stephenie over.

478
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,393
>> Come on, Danielle!

479
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,602
>> Come on, Parvi!

480
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,854
>> PROBST: Danielle has the bag

481
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:02,855
for the Villains!

482
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,940
Villains score the first point!

483
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:11,029
Villains lead one-zip.

484
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,239
>> My shoulder.

485
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,783
Wait, wait, wait.

486
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,451
>> No. We got medic. He's here.

487
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,994
>> No, no, no.

488
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,121
Hold on, hold on.

489
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,248
I gotta relax.

490
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,083
>> PROBST: What happened?

491
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,669
>> If it's out...

492
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,295
>> What do you want me to do?

493
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,756
>> I'm a medical student, and

494
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,339
when I saw Stephenie dislocate

495
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,425
her shoulder, I knew she could

496
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,093
leave the game permanently over

497
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,511
something like that.

498
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,220
>> PROBST: You want medical

499
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,638
look at it?

500
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,057
>> What happens if medical

501
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,974
looks at it?

502
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,809
>> PROBST: Stay here, stay here.

503
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,811
Medical.

504
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:51,153
>> Ah!

505
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,654
>> Hi.

506
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,280
>> PROBST: Her shoulder's

507
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:53,947
popped out.

508
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,157
>> Yeah, we'll get her down.

509
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,950
You can just kneel down for

510
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,659
for me?

511
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,327
(Stephenie gasping)

512
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,369
Hold it up.

513
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,454
>> PROBST: Hold it up?

514
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:00,704
Like that?

515
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,914
>> Yup.

516
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,415
Just need someone to go

517
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,708
over there.

518
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,250
You're all right.

519
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,045
>> PROBST: Hang tight, okay?

520
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:12,382
(Stephenie gasping)

521
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,425
(crunch)

522
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,261
>> Oh! Okay.

523
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,055
>> Yay!

524
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,139
>> The Villains are brutal.

525
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,140
They dislocated my shoulder the

526
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,683
first challenge.

527
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,018
I mean, really?

528
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,478
Like, you're already on the

529
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,355
Villain tribe, do you have to

530
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,189
act like a total, like, jerk?

531
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,358
It's okay now. I just...

532
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,192
>> PROBST: Wow.

533
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,319
>> All right, guys, let's go.

534
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,115
>> PROBST: All right, we have

535
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,783
played our first point of the

536
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,159
first challenge of

537
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,744
<i>Survivor 20,</i> and we have

538
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,495
our first injury.

539
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,454
Stephenie's shoulder had

540
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,289
to be popped back into place.

541
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,500
Next round is one man,

542
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,209
one woman.

543
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,087
It's Amanda and J.T.

544
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,214
taking on Randy and Jerri.

545
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:56,093
Lane two.

546
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:56,510
Survivors ready?

547
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,553
Go!

548
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,971
>> Come on, Jerri!

549
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,138
Kick some ass!

550
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,807
>> PROBST: Looking for that bag.

551
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,891
then you gotta get back

552
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,433
with it.

553
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,645
Everybody putting one hand in

554
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,772
the sand and one eye on their

555
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,358
their opponent.

556
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,192
>> Randy!

557
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,026
>> PROBST: Jerri's got it.

558
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,112
Now, it's a battle to get it up.

559
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,905
Jerri found it, but she didn't

560
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,906
get it up.

561
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,074
Amanda trying to pull Jerri out

562
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:19,575
of there.

563
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,325
>> Get right on him, Randy!

564
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,368
Pull him down!

565
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,411

00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,203
at it.

567
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,790
>> Jerri, get back down!

00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,167
>> PROBST: Nobody has the bag!

569
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:29,960
>> Punch him!

570
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,253

to get back to your mat.

00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,309
up and down, went like a "J."

763
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,644
My toe is broke.

764
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,770
>> Oh, my God.

765
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,814
>> I can feel it.

766
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,607
Not that one, this one.

767
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:11,194
>> We'll fix you with codeine.

768
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,446
(Rupert gasps)

769
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:13,822
>> There we go.

770
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,239
That's stuck in now.

771
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:14,823
>> My toe is broke, and I felt

772
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,325
it cracking inside.

773
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,577
But I'm not getting put out of

774
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,830
this game over a damn toe.

775
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,914
First damn day.

776
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,169
>> PROBST: All right,

777
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,671
so let's do an injury count.

778
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,381
Rupert has a broken toe,

779
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,300
Stephenie has a dislocated and

780
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,843
then relocated shoulder.

781
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,179
Hopefully, it was worth it.

782
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,432
Big victory for the Heroes.

783
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:40,640
Fire.

784
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,642
And a map to your new home.

785
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:46,730
Villains, you are definitely

786
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,773
living up to your name.

787
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,816
Grab your stuff, head to your

788
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,358
camp and start working on

789
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:50,650
on shelter.

790
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,820
>> The Villains lost.

791
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,531
You think that really bothers

792
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,657
me, losing?

793
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,700
'Cause I'm used to losing with

794
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,743
a bunch of dummies.

795
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,785
But the difference is this

796
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,955
ain't a bunch of dummies.

797
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,706
We<i> will</i> win.

798
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,167
And I'm looking forward to

799
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,252
sending the Heroes to Tribal

800
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,338
Council and letting them do

801
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,965
their hero thing.

802
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,144
>> Look what we've got here.

803
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,062
We've got fins.

804
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,938
>> Fins, and is there a sling

805
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,565
in here, or not?

806
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,567
>> Fins!

807
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,151
>> There's a...

808
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:33,943
>> Yeah, that's it.

809
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:34,194
>> What?

810
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,570
>> You gotta make your own out

811
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:35,904
of a stick.

812
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,655
>> Make it.

813
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,239
>> I can't believe I'm doing

814
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:38,531
this again.

815
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,033
It's just starting to sink in.

816
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:40,867
I believe I'm going to have to

817
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,701
stay on my toes with these

818
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,535
fellas.

819
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,703
I'm ready for it.

820
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,205
I'm ready for the challenge.

821
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,790
>> I think that we should live

822
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,416
under this tree because it's

823
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,292
it's dry.

824
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,418
>> That's what I'm,

825
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:50,919
that's what I'm thinking.

826
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,463
This is, like, the biggest tree

827
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,965
right here, right?

828
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,259
>> I am, yeah, really bad.

829
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:58,802
>> Really?

830
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,928
>> I got about ten bites

831
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,678
already.

832
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,304
>> They like that dragon blood.

833
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:01,596
(laughter)

834
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,264
>> I got way more to prove

835
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,891
right here than I did the

836
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,683
last time.

837
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,936
If I could do it here, if I can

838
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,438
take it all the way, if I can

839
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,523
whup these all-stars, doesn't

840
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:21,658
that mean I'm the best ever?

841
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,118
>> I'm gonna play similar

842
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,452
to the same game.

843
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,955
I'm gonna use the mind game.

844
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,790
They better give it their all

845
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,585
and play the game because

846
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,878
I'm taking this crap serious.

847
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,297
That's why I'm here.

848
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,341
I have to work my magic on,

849
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,884
on the villain side, which is

850
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,304
gonna be tough.

851
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,223
I'm gonna be straight up

852
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,141
with you.

853
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,976
>> Yeah.

854
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,396
>> Yeah, so do I.

855
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,689
>> I'm an aggressive player.

856
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,399
I'm here to win, and, you know,

857
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,067
I want to make smart alliances.

858
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,527
>> The thing is, if we can

859
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,153
trust each other and we can do

860
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,821
this... which I trust you.

861
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,613
>> Yeah.

862
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,156
>> ...which, I trust you.

863
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:01,656
>> Yeah, I trust you, too.

864
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:02,157
>> You have to trust me.

865
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,576
You have to no matter what.

866
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,160
>> I know.

867
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,578
>> Because that's the whole name

868
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,537
of the game.

869
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:07,954
>> I know, I know.

870
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,622
>> And this is where it happens

871
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:09,956
the first day.

872
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,457
This is when it happens.

873
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,082
>> Sure, I know.

874
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,625
>> With Russell, he's a great

875
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,085
person to play this game with.

876
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,628
He knows exactly what he's

877
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,129
he's doing.

878
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,046
I'm going with my gut and I

879
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,007
think that I-I should stick with

880
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,966
him until it gets to a point

881
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,509
where I feel like he'd

882
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,637
turn on me.

883
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,472
>> I know.

884
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,973
>> I'll do whatever it takes to

885
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:27,849
get to the top, but what I'm

886
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,266
telling you is...

887
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:28,683
>> Yeah.

888
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:29,434
>> ...is I want to get

889
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,560
to the top with you.

890
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,060
>> Yeah.

891
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,812
>> We are going to be better of

892
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,813
a pair than you can even

893
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,189
possibly imagine.

894
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,315
>> I agree.

895
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:40,612
...period.

896
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,112
That's what I really,

897
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,072
really want.

898
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,825
>> And I can swing it.

899
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,714
>> I clearly know that Russell

900
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,007
is running around talking to

901
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,050
everyone and telling everyone

902
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,885
the same thing, but we can

903
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,637
either work with each other or

904
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,472
against each other, and I do

905
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,307
not want to work against him.

906
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,350
Are you kidding?

907
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,060
He's just an incredible force.

908
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,066
>> I do.

909
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,115
>> With Russell, I definitely

910
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,118
feel like I am making a deal

911
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,870
with the devil, but I want the

912
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,829
devil on my side.

913
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,665
>> These are all-stars, but you

914
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,374
know what?

915
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:34,874
I'm a little above that.

916
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,418
Like Michael Jordan is in

917
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,671
basketball, like Michael Phelps

918
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,463
is in swimming.

919
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,089
There's always somebody that's

920
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:45,301
<i>above</i> their sport.

921
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,762
And I'm the best player

922
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:48,930
that ever played this game.

923
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,848
Now guess what?

924
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,975
I get to prove it.

925
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,520
(chuckles)

926
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,115
>> Sweet!

927
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,117
>> All right!

928
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,660
Nice!

929
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,120
>> Man, we got a net.

930
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,663
>> Wow!

931
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,914
We have a net?

932
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,332
>> A net! Oh, sweet.

933
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,293
>> Well, here we are, guys.

934
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,295
>> Here we are.

935
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,463
>> Heroes?

936
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,631
>> We're heroes!

937
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,215
>> Yeah!

938
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:24,465
>> Heroes!

939
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,967
(laughter)

940
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,467
>> "Return, revenge and

941
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,844
redemption."

942
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:28,636
>> Well...

943
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,012
>> All right.

944
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,388
>> Shall we take a

945
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,097
celebratory dip?

946
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,848
>> Yes.

947
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,724
>> I think so.

948
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,558
>> It takes a little bit to get

949
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,018
back into the rhythm of

950
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,978
<i>Survivor</i> and go, "All right, I

951
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,895
"remember this.

952
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,814
It's gonna be miserable."

953
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,149
A little chillier than you'd

954
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:41,941
think, isn't it?

955
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,568
But you just don't remember

956
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,320
what it feels like to be

957
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,112
stranded and know you're just

958
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,113
at the tip, you're at the

959
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:47,655
beginning of a long journey,

960
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,533
if you're lucky.

961
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,285
>> It's got to be the best

962
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,661
first-day challenge I've ever

963
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,079
seen in any<i> Survivor.</i>

964
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,623
Sugar got topless.

965
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:56,873
(laughter)

966
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,082
Stephenie dislocated her

967
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,167
shoulder and put it back in,

968
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,462
and Rupert broke one toe in

969
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,254
three places.

970
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,423
>> You know, the challenge, I

971
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,550
think our team showed its

972
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,134
it's strength.

973
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,427
Unfortunately, I didn't.

974
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,803
You know, the challenge was

975
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,262
rough for me.

976
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,639
I don't like losing at

977
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,848
anything, and I got beat by

978
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,057
Coach.

979
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,477
So I'm so rusty on the game,

980
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,269
but I'm having a good time.

981
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,187
>> We're making our first group

982
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,772
decision.

983
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,105
>> Oh, goody!

984
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,316
>> I mean, we can just build

985
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,609
something really quick

986
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,777
right now.

987
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,362
Yeah, we can always move it.

988
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,696
>> Um, the two oldest men...

989
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,323
>> Oh, no, no, no!

990
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:34,118
>> can we have, can we...?

991
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:34,369
(laughter)

992
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,161
can we just...?

993
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,289
>> The two older men, could

994
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,082
you guys keep your opinions

995
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,625
to yourself?

996
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,418
>> We're all kids, and we don't

997
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:42,752
know anything.

998
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:43,920
So-- what do you guys think?

999
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,047
Is it better to have more bugs

1000
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,257
in the jungle or would it be

1001
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,842
too cold out here or can we

1002
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,260
just build a shelter to block

1003
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,011
the wind?

1004
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,012
>> I say here.

1005
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,681
>> I say front.

1006
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,973
All for here?

1007
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,600
>> We'll have a fire.

1008
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,268
>> We can start a fire

1009
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,144
in the rain.

1010
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,270
>> All right.

1011
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:11,030
>> Yay!

1012
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,534
>> Wow, this is light.

1013
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,997
There you go!

1014
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,082
Get it, girl!

1015
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,417
>> I love my tribe.

1016
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,710
We have a good aura.

1017
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,502
We have good energy.

1018
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,086
You know, we all have a good

1019
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,337
work ethic.

1020
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:26,921
If you just wanna help, like,

1021
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:27,547
start putting 'em up, maybe, I

1022
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,214
guess, right?

1023
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:28,423
>> Yeah.

1024
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,007
>> We know what needs to be

1025
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,843
done, and we work together,

1026
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,553
and I feel really lucky to be

1027
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,722
on the Heroes' side and to have

1028
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,140
the team I have.

1029
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,433
>> I think we should use the

1030
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,101
big ones, maybe, for the top,

1031
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,019
higher up, so it could be

1032
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:42,270
more...

1033
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,938
Like, everything was going

1034
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:44,480
right.

1035
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,357
We have good karma right now.

1036
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,068
It's great.

1037
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,363
>> You know what we need?

1038
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,073
Like, the post to split the

1039
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,409
coconut husk on.

1040
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,286
You got to get, like, a short,

1041
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,996
pointy...

1042
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:00,455
(chicken clucking)

1043
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,749
Thought I heard some clucking,

1044
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,332
and went around and looked in

1045
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,543
the bush, and I see some

1046
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,961
movement out of the corner

1047
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,379
of my eye, and here comes a

1048
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,756
rooster, three hens, walking

1049
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,133
right out.

1050
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,092
Guys, look at this.

1051
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,511
There are at least three

1052
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,846
chickens right here.

1053
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,138
>> Chicken?

1054
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:17,805
>> Stay right here, Tom.

1055
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,015
I'm gonna go around the

1056
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:19,807
other side.

1057
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,058
>> Here's another one

1058
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:21,350
right here.

1059
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,144
>> Great, we got four chickens.

1060
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:23,603
There's another one.

1061
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:23,811
>> Yep.

1062
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,395
>> Well, we got three people

1063
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,065
still, so anybody that can catch

1064
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,024
a chicken, come this way.

1065
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,108
>> Go around the back, guys,

1066
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,151
and draw them out towards us.

1067
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,612
>> Does he have the net?

1068
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,237
>> Yeah, grab that fishing net,

1069
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,781
would be great.

1070
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,701
>> Bring it up.

1071
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,912
Everybody who's free should

1072
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:44,791
just surround them.

1073
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,876
Hey, uh...

1074
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,128
how about if we have four of us

1075
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,880
go, like, one, two, and then

1076
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,173
just throw it out like this?

1077
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,549
>> So, are you ready?

1078
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,926
>> Don't overthrow.

1079
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:55,927
>> Shh, shh, shh.

1080
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,511
>> Are we gonna throw it on

1081
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,096
three?

1082
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:58,638
>> We're gonna throw it on

1083
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,931
three.

1084
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:00,556
>> ...two...

1085
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,225
We're just practicing.

1086
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,476
>> ...three.

1087
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:03,810
>> Yeah, baby!

1088
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,394
>> No, it's getting away!

1089
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,938
>> Got it, got it!

1090
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:07,355
>> You got it, man.

1091
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,190
(chickens clucking)

1092
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,274
(whooping)

1093
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,109
>> We got ourselves chicken!

1094
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:12,652
>> Winner, winner, chicken

1095
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,529
dinner!

1096
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,863
>> Yeah! Winner, winner, chicken

1097
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,156
dinner!

1098
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,199
>> I have seen my share of

1099
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,326
chickens, and I've caught my

1100
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,161
share of 'em, but never in the

1101
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,038
wild, and to actually, you know,

1102
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:24,580
catch them successfully, all

1103
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,415
four of them, that's

1104
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,750
incredible.

1105
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,043
>> Oh, my God.

1106
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:30,294
I don't believe it.

1107
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,629
>> I know.

1108
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,214
>> Oh, my God, you guys!

1109
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,257
>> Nice work.

1110
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,134
>> They are cute, aren't they?

1111
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,261
Watching these guys working

1112
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,514
together, I'm ecstatic.

1113
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,641
Coming back into<i> Survivor,</i> I

1114
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,352
know the first five days are

1115
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,312
the hardest time.

1116
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,439
I haven't hit that wall yet.

1117
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,984
Maybe in our tribe, we won't.

1118
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,318
I mean, shoot, we found

1119
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,194
chickens?

1120
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,404
We're going to be out of the

1121
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,406
elements.

1122
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:11,043
It's good to be a Hero.

1123
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:11,878
>> What'd you guys think of

1124
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,962
the challenge today?

1125
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,380
>> Let's review-- we're glad

1126
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,299
that Rupert stubbed his toe.

1127
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,758
>> Aargh!

1128
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,009
(laughter)

1129
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:18,634
>> The thing is, like, one part

1130
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,636
of me, like, wants to have

1131
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,181
sympathy for him, but another

1132
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,349
side of me, I almost relished

1133
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,350
the fact that they got injured.

1134
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,936
I was like, "Good for them."

1135
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,353
(laughter)

1136
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,022
>> I definitely had mixed

1137
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:31,564
emotions about losing the

1138
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,649
challenge, because whereas

1139
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,276
personally it made a statement,

1140
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,402
the tribe lost.

1141
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,571
I had him the whole time.

1142
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,280
There was not one point in that

1143
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,115
challenge where I thought he

1144
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,074
was gonna get the better of me.

1145
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,159
>> You were very relaxed.

1146
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:43,826
I saw it in your face.

1147
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,785
>> Well, there was this sec

1148
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,329
that he almost took off running

1149
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:46,954
and you had to tackle him down.

1150
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:47,413
>> Yeah.

1151
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,916
>> We were like, "No!"

1152
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,375
>> Everybody thought that Colby

1153
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,752
was gonna have his way with me.

1154
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,378
The tribe was taking about it

1155
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,421
long after I'd forgotten it,

1156
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,506
about how I'd gone out there

1157
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,925
and basically frog-marched Colby

1158
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,010
to, uh, to the mat at the end.

1159
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,011
So it was very fulfilling.

1160
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,221
And at the very end, dude, I

1161
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:03,846
was, like, kind of, like, moved

1162
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,767
him, moved him, moved him, mat.

1163
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,809
>> Bam.

1164
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,936
(laughter)

1165
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:10,478
>> It was... I enjoyed every

1166
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,063
second of that.

1167
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,440
Coach, what a surprise.

1168
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,108
Honestly, I'm-I'm very surprised

1169
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:16,567
by Coach.

1170
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,860
There's just something about

1171
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,486
him, and I don't know what it

1172
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,278
is yet.

1173
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,572
I'm definitely gonna make it a

1174
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,157
point to get to know Coach.

1175
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,367
I know I'm stealing Coach's

1176
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,994
mantra here, but I'm going into

1177
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:27,703
this like a warrior.

1178
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,454
'Cause that's really what you

1179
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,789
have to do.

1180
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,540
>> How did you know that was my

1181
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,625
mantra?

1182
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,085
>> Uh, I heard stuff about you.

1183
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:34,418
>> Yeah, okay.

1184
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,879
One thing that appeals to me

1185
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,339
about Jerri is that she's a

1186
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,632
different kind of girl, and, uh,

1187
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,216
that interests me, because I'm

1188
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,926
a different kind of guy.

1189
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,427
>> Randy, I hear you chuckling

1190
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,929
over there.

1191
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,430
>> (laughing): No, I'm laughing

1192
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,933
at Colby's face.

1193
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,476
Actually, he looked a little

1194
00:37:50,559 --> 00:38:08,786
scared.

1195
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,371
...you don't step away from

1196
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,580
love.

1197
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,332
If it's hitting you in the

1198
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,625
face, you grab ahold to it.

1199
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,876
You never know, man.

1200
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,253
>> You never know.

1201
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:17,670
>> You never know.

1202
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,089
>> I would never get in the way

1203
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,298
of true love.

1204
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,550
>> Go for it, dude. Go for it.

1205
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,426
>> I agree.

1206
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,302
>> Are you talking about

1207
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,387
Parvati?

1208
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,263
(laughter)

1209
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,682
>> I have never in a million

1210
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,225
years would think about coming

1211
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:31,934
out on<i> Survivor</i> and actually

1212
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,686
being interested in somebody.

1213
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,395
But Jerri and I, we have a

1214
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,480
little connection.

1215
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,733
>> How's it going, Coach?

1216
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:42,445
I'm keeping my eye on him.

1217
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,405
>> Are you guys playing Cupid?

1218
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:44,613
>> Yes.

1219
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,116
You and the dragon slayer.

1220
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:47,408
(laughing)

1221
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,618
>> Ooh, I see romance blooming

1222
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,620
between Jerri and Coach.

1223
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,497
And Jerri's in total denial,

1224
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,999
but she totally flirts, and

1225
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,542
she's, I think, in spite of

1226
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,586
herself, a little bit in love

1227
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,881
with the dragon slayer.

1228
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,007
>> I'm setting you up with

1229
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,716
Coach.

1230
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,675
What's the problem?

1231
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,634
You know what?

1232
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,594
Love finds you sometimes, and

1233
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,596
you don't even know it.

1234
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,388
>> Well, you do know that just

1235
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,558
by cuddling together one night,

1236
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,976
we created a whole little...

1237
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,977
>> I know.

1238
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,604
>> ...controversial buzz that

1239
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,898
could potentially not be...

1240
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,690
I don't know.

1241
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,691
>> Well, I just think we carry

1242
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,484
on our business.

1243
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,860
I mean, I think that if we just

1244
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:23,778
go about our day and we don't

1245
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,820
have too many talks like this,

1246
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:25,654
unless we're walking down the

1247
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,030
beach that way.

1248
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,364
>> I know, right?

1249
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:27,948
>> But it sucks, because, you

1250
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,284
know, obviously, I want to talk

1251
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,494
to you.

1252
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:31,911
>> I know, I know.

1253
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:32,578
>> The girls were joking about

1254
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,537
it.

1255
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,622
They were, like, "Oh, the black

1256
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,457
widow and the dragon slayer--

1257
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,458
what a combination."

1258
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,126
Hey, you never know, we might

1259
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,586
pair up and run this game.

1260
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,171
But we need to be careful,

1261
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,380
Jerri and I, of having the

1262
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,715
appearance of being in an

1263
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,800
unbreakable alliance.

1264
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,176
>> Will you promise me if I

1265
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,177
should worry about something,

1266
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,178
let me know?

1267
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,137
>> Well, don't worry about

1268
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,305
anything.

1269
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:52,098
Okay?

1270
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,015
>> Okay. Yeah, 'cause the

1271
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,058
last... I hate feeling alone

1272
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:54,809
out here.

1273
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,684
>> Don't... You're not alone.

1274
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,727
>> It's the worst feeling in

1275
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,436
the world.

1276
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,687
>> No, you shouldn't be worried.

1277
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,022
You're with the dragon slayer,

1278
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,315
man-- don't you worry about

1279
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,442
that.

1280
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,374
>> We got a good group.

1281
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:18,916
>> That's what I'm saying.

1282
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,500
>> Here's the thing, this is

1283
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,584
between me and you right here,

1284
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,378
it's got to be.

1285
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:22,920
But I'm willing to make an

1286
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:23,504
alliance right now with you.

1287
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,505
'Cause I haven't made an

1288
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,799
alliance with nobody, brother.

1289
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,175
>> Yeah.

1290
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,260
>> I don't want the physical

1291
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,344
threat of being thrown out of

1292
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:30,928
here.

1293
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:31,929
We should never lose, man.

1294
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,513
>> Yeah.

1295
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,681
>> I don't want flower power to

1296
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,890
be running over this thing like

1297
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:35,599
it was, you know.

1298
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,684
>> Hey, I went through it, so...

1299
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,476
>> I know, man.

1300
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,477
>> It was terrible.

1301
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,728
>> James and I, you know, we're

1302
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,729
buddies right off the bat.

1303
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,398
We both work hard.

1304
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:42,815
He's a guy's guy.

1305
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,942
I mean, we can talk straight up.

1306
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:45,901
Anything he tells me, I

1307
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,694
believe it.

1308
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,112
Could I ever beat James if it

1309
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,530
was me and him in the final two?

1310
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,991
No. But... I don't see me and

1311
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,242
him in the final two.

1312
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,702
I'd rather see us rock on

1313
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,995
through and stay strong, dude.

1314
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,329
>> Yeah, let's keep the guys

1315
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,330
together.

1316
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,456
>> If we go to... That's...

1317
00:40:59,540 --> 00:40:59,915
hey, that's the deal.

1318
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,584
>> No, for real.

1319
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,877
>> I'm gonna form alliances

1320
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,878
with everyone I can.

1321
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,462
My strategy is to keep everyone

1322
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,841
on my side, man.

1323
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,719
>> Here's the thing, Candice...

1324
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,181
...for J.T. and James.

1325
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,849
>> I know that James and Amanda

1326
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,934
played together.

1327
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,607
>> I don't know them, but I

1328
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,983
know that there's people that,

1329
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,903
you know...

1330
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,030
>> Yeah. That's my concern.

1331
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,656
>> The first couple of days are

1332
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,408
always the worst out here.

1333
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:34,867
Because you don't have

1334
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,494
everything settled, you don't

1335
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,246
know everybody, and so it's

1336
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,207
always kind of awkward.

1337
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,542
>> What do you know about Cirie?

1338
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,543
>> You mean, like, how she

1339
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:44,919
played the game?

1340
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:45,544
>> I don't know anything about

1341
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,254
her.

1342
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,550
>> I don't know her.

1343
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:51,759
>> Yeah.

1344
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:55,346
>> Are they friends?

1345
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,805
>> Going into the game again,

1346
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,599
I'm worried about people who

1347
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,351
have a history together,

1348
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:00,893
they've played on seasons

1349
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,020
before together.

1350
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,397
And I don't really have anyone

1351
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,941
that I have a solid history

1352
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,567
with going into the game.

1353
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,362
>> Well, didn't take long for

1354
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,488
the game to start.

1355
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,405
>> (laughs): Yeah.

1356
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,406
>> We're back again.

1357
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,407
>> I know.

1358
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,408
What do you think?

1359
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,409
>> I don't know yet.

1360
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,410
What do you think?

1361
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,411
>> I don't know, I'm trying

1362
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,371
to...

1363
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,372
>> Trying to assess the

1364
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:21,956
situation.

1365
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:22,790
>> Yeah. (laughs)

1366
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,625
Exactly.

1367
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,168
We can't be off alone like

1368
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,295
this, though.

1369
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,092
>> James, myself, and Cirie,

1370
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,343
you know, we've played this

1371
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:34,802
game together before.

1372
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,719
I've played this twice with

1373
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,888
James-- in China and Micronesia.

1374
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,265
I've played it once with Cirie,

1375
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,641
and Cirie and I went to the end

1376
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,642
together.

1377
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,018
We were in an alliance the

1378
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,311
whole time, so we're going to

1379
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,562
have to watch our distance,

1380
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,064
because if people think we're

1381
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,316
too chummy, it could... it could

1382
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,858
definitely play against us.

1383
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,194
>> So, how you doing, my friend?

1384
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,280
Welcome to Samoa. (laughing)

1385
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:54,863
>> Thank God we're on the same

1386
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,282
tribe.

1387
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,491
>> It's good to be here with you

1388
00:42:57,574 --> 00:43:00,369
again-- yeah, that's great!

1389
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,037
It's like déjà vu, right?

1390
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,956
So, um, hopefully, we can just

1391
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,249
run this thing where we avoid

1392
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,750
Tribal Council in the beginning.

1393
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,128
>> Yeah, but I'm trying to

1394
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,463
think who... who do you want to

1395
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,965
get involved with here.

1396
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:13,882
>> Right.

1397
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,552
My closest ally is Stephenie.

1398
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,305
We played well together in our

1399
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:19,805
season in Palau.

1400
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,640
And, uh, I was thrilled to see

1401
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,851
her back here on this beach in

1402
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,811
my tribe.

1403
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,688
I think Colby... Colby, J.T.

1404
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,189
and you would be my choice, but

1405
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,441
like you said, we don't know

1406
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,025
what they're thinking is...

1407
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,651
>> That's what I was thinking.

1408
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,320
>> I'm gonna try to work with

1409
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,196
Stephenie as far as we can, but

1410
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,906
she might not be my smartest

1411
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,117
end player.

1412
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,869
If I were to get that far in

1413
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,745
the game and were to face a

1414
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,122
jury, I want somebody else who

1415
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:45,748
won the million dollars to sit

1416
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,541
next to me.

1417
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,959
So, you know, seeing you right

1418
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,294
away, I will... you know, you

1419
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,754
want to make some kind of an

1420
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:52,755
oath, whatever.

1421
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,465
You and I need each other in the

1422
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,049
finals, because we both won

1423
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:55,758
the money.

1424
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,842
>> They have to choose one of

1425
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,635
us.

1426
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,720
>> If either one of us, no

1427
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,013
matter how good a game we play,

1428
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:01,930
goes up against someone who

1429
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:02,848
didn't win...

1430
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:03,140
>> We lose.

1431
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,600
Me and you, man.

1432
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,560
>> It's a good plan.

1433
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:08,103
>> People are expecting me to be

1434
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,313
that guy they saw on Tocantins,

1435
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,689
you know, that guy who stuck by

1436
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,149
his word and done everything he

1437
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,109
had to do.

1438
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,277
But this game is completely

1439
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,236
different, because everyone's

1440
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,695
already seen me play.

1441
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,281
>> You're my guy for the end.

1442
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:19,823
>> All right, you got me.

1443
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,658
>> Right.

1444
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,785
>> You know, I need you...

1445
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,078
and you need me.

1446
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,037
>> We need each other.

1447
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,663
>> To win this game of<i> Survivor,</i>

1448
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,082
you have to have a dark side

1449
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:28,749
somewhere.

1450
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,376
You have to be willing to

1451
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,835
sacrifice some of your

1452
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,587
integrity to make it far in

1453
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,588
this game.

1454
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,256
And I'm not looking to save

1455
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,508
my hero name.

1456
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,259
I'm here to do what I have to

1457
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,302
do to win this game.

1458
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:40,886
So it's going to be a whole

1459
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,473
different ballgame for me.

1460
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:54,817
(sighs)

1461
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,193
>> Sandra, do you know how to

1462
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,236
do this?

1463
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,612
(laughter)

1464
00:44:58,695 --> 00:44:59,113
>> This is not working.

1465
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,281
I think I'm not going to do

1466
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,785
this anymore.

1467
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,537
>> We got ten people here.

1468
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,913
They don't want to do anything

1469
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,415
for more than, like, ten minutes

1470
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,290
at a time.

1471
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,417
>> I know.

1472
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,418
>> But nobody has any energy,

1473
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,043
because we don't have any water.

1474
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,878
>> Everybody's going to be dead

1475
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,505
for this challenge if we don't

1476
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,673
get water.

1477
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,507
>> Yeah.

1478
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,800
>> We have to build a fire.

1479
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,427
It's been six years since I've

1480
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,010
played the game, and a lot has

1481
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,763
changed.

1482
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,849
Like, there's nobody here that

1483
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,809
wants to do anything.

1484
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,227
They don't want to build a

1485
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,019
shelter.

1486
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,646
They don't want to try to get a

1487
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,397
fire going.

1488
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,731
It's not that they don't know

1489
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,858
what to do-- they've all played

1490
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:36,942
<i>Survivor</i> before.

1491
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:37,860
Sandra's won the game.

1492
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,654
So they know what they're

1493
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:41,572
doing.

1494
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,574
And it's, like, ripping at my

1495
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,992
every fiber. Ugh!

1496
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,495
My wife told me, have patience.

1497
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,665
Amber, I'm trying.

1498
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:52,207
>> You're-you're just gonna

1499
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,959
carve a gouge in there and...

1500
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,043
>> A little gouge.

1501
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,545
Then I'm going to take another

1502
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,005
piece of bamboo and rub it

1503
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:58,255
like this.

1504
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,965
>> You know, nobody's going to

1505
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,341
get voted out for not making

1506
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,551
fire, and nobody's going to get

1507
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:02,843
to stay...

1508
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,927
>> If they do.

1509
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,597
>> ...trying to make fire.

1510
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,140
So why don't we blow it off?

1511
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:08,974
>> Do you think? (laughs)

1512
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,310
You're just going to wear

1513
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,437
yourself out.

1514
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:16,815
>> You know, I played this game

1515
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,067
before, and if you don't have

1516
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,861
flint and steel, you can't make

1517
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,279
fire.

1518
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:22,821
Not by rubbing two sticks

1519
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,490
together.

1520
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,699
This game lasts 39 days.

1521
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,075
I think we'll get fire by the

1522
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,077
end of 39 days.

1523
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,788
>> Now, slow, short strokes at

1524
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:41,215
first.

1525
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,342
A little faster, guys.

1526
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,262
>> Starting to get some smoke.

1527
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,263
>> Yeah!

1528
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,556
>> Oh, my God!

1529
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,724
>> Keep going.

1530
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:51,975
All right, real fast now.

1531
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,061
>> Here we go!

1532
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,230
(loud grunting)

1533
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,065
>> Three, two, one.

1534
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,943
Do it.

1535
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,915
>> Flames.

1536
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,208
>> It's happening.

1537
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,042
>> This is happening.

1538
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,335
>> Rob, you're the man down

1539
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,044
here, too.

1540
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,087
None of us are gonna do

1541
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:20,337
anything.

1542
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,172
You're in charge.

1543
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,804
>> Here we go.

1544
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,889
>> Here we go.

1545
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:31,265
(excited shouts)

1546
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,015
>> Oh, yeah!

1547
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,059
Unbelievable!

1548
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:37,145
>> I'm still the same guy I was

1549
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:37,896
the first time I played this

1550
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,691
game-- that competitiveness,

1551
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,235
that cutthroat-ness, that's me.

1552
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,027
At the same time, a lot has

1553
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,780
happened with me personally in

1554
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,156
my life in the six years since

1555
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:48,907
I've played this game last.

1556
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,117
You know, I got married, I had

1557
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,869
a kid, I'm learning compromise

1558
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,787
and patience.

1559
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,330
But look at these people, you

1560
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:55,998
know?

1561
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,416
Not the brightest bulbs, and

1562
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,709
I'm here trying to make the

1563
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,043
most of it, trying to make it

1564
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,587
work.

1565
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,546
>> We got fire!

1566
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:02,963
(excited shouts)

1567
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,923
>> Look at it!

1568
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:05,924
>> Wow!

1569
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,092
>> Beautiful!

1570
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:07,968
>> Amazing!

1571
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,428
>> I wouldn't have believed it

1572
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,596
if I didn't see it.

1573
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,556
>> (laughs): I know, man.

1574
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,181
>> Now, I got to tell you, I'm a

1575
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,642
little in awe of Rob, and I'm

1576
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,810
not like that with people.

1577
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:17,978
You know, he's played it twice.

1578
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,438
He's intuitive and ingenious

1579
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,606
and very smart.

1580
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,273
So that's great.

1581
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,899
I mean, he's a great guy to

1582
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:23,317
have on the tribe.

1583
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,901
You are the man.

1584
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:25,485
And it's, like, when you're

1585
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,987
talking, I'm just, like...

1586
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,322
I'm, like, literally hanging on

1587
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,364
every word.

1588
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,324
>> I appreciate it, I do.

1589
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,074
>> I'm serious.

1590
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:31,950
I'm, like, hanging on every

1591
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:32,159
word.

1592
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,411
>> We made fire, and now

1593
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:35,662
Coach is going off with Boston

1594
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,163
Rob like he's a hero or

1595
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,081
something.

1596
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,042
>> I'm bromancing on my idol,

1597
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:40,417
what can I say?

1598
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,044
>> Rob, he thinks he's the boss

1599
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,920
of the camp.

1600
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,047
He thinks he's in control.

1601
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,382
But this is my mountain, and I'm

1602
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,926
still the king of the hill.

1603
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,928
<i>Survivor</i> is my palace.

1604
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,930
So I'm still the king, unless

1605
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:54,931
I'm dethroned.

1606
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:55,974
And you know what?

1607
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,060
That ain't gonna happen.

1608
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,855
>> PROBST: Coming up on this

1609
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,190
special two-hour season

1610

>> We have to divide them.

1613
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,570
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?

1614
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,196
Go!

1615
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,115
>> Come on, Heroes!

1616
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,367
>> PROBST: Coach leading the

1617
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,076
tribe of Villains, using all of

1618
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,121
that life experience in a kayak.

1619
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:18,997
>> It's only a matter of time

1620
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,957
before that tribe

1621
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,503
self-destructs.

1622
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,588
>> It's time to cut his throat.

1623
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:41,144
>> Being able to get out in the

1624
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,439
ocean, that's where I feel most

1625
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,440
comfortable.

1626
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,192
But my toe is broken at least

1627
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,485
two places.

1628
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,194
And I haven't caught a darn

1629
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,195
fish yet.

1630
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,781
I think it'd be better off

1631
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,991
for me right now, especially

1632
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,159
with my darn toe, to be a

1633
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,161
worker bee.

1634
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,914
I'm going to start us a fire.

1635
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,833
You can do this.

1636
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:11,049
Just start the damn fire.

1637
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,884
(whispers): Gosh darn it.

1638
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,928
Come on.

1639
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,096
Come on. Come on.

1640
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,641
Come on, you can do this.

1641
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,768
>> Rupert the fire maker.

1642
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,936
(laughing): He shaved half the

1643
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,272
magnesium off the flint, you

1644
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,065
know, and still couldn't get the

1645
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,067
fire.

1646
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,193
You don't want to say anything.

1647
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,279
You just sit there and watch,

1648
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,116
because his ego is so humongous.

1649
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,410
What can you say?

1650
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,872
>> Yeah, I'll tell you why I

1651
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,123
can't, Rupe.

1652
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,833
>> You want to go ahead, but,

1653
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,918
uh, I've been sitting here

1654
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,128
for a while, and... we've had

1655
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,797
some hellacious piles of

1656
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,090
magnesium.

1657
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,967
God!

1658
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,010
It's okay.

1659
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:55,469
It's a state of mind.

1660
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,721
Making fire is as much a state

1661
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,806
of mind as anything.

1662
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,936
(birds chirping)

1663
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:16,281
>> Wow, that's looking...

1664
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,743
Now we're talking.

1665
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:20,952
>> Yay.

1666
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,204
The only thing that I'm worried

1667
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,164
about is my darn broken toe.

1668
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,666
If it starts coming up more and

1669
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,334
more about how much pain I'm

1670
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,295
really in and what I really can

1671
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,589
bring to this tribe-- because I

1672
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,633
haven't done a whole lot yet--

1673
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,300
that worries me.

1674
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,970
Wow. Good for you guys.

00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,044
If he breaks his leg.

1690
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,045
>> He's a father.

1691
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,213
>> Yeah, I was told not to do

1692
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,089
anything stupid.

1693
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:14,548
You go ahead and try.

1694
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,591
I could probably get up there

1695
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,217
and get them, but why would I

1696
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,469
risk falling and getting hurt?

1697
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,345
Man, it's higher than it looks.

1698
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,764
But I know somebody that, you

1699
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,099
know, is so full of themself,

1700
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,183
when you give them a challenge,

1701
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,560
they're just going to have to

1702
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,602
do it because they're the

1703
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,020
greatest and the best, and

1704
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,272
you know, every day out here

1705
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:34,734
they get stronger.

1706
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,278
>> He wants to be a Hero, but

1707
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,821
he's really a Villain, so we'll

1708
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,865
see how this goes.

1709
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,323
>> I say don't do it.

1710
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,534
>> Get your ass up that tree,

1711
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,618
will ya?

1712
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,911
>> Boston Rob and I do have a

1713
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,037
good time together, you know?

1714
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:46,621
I like talking to him, because

1715
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:47,330
he's really-- he's sharp, and I

1716
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,332
like that, and he's gonna

1717
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,542
challenge me, and I think I'm

1718
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,793
gonna challenge him.

1719
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,044
I think I need somebody that's

1720
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,296
able to sharpen me, as iron

1721
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,422
sharpens iron.

1722
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,049
>> Come on, you can do it.

1723
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,301
>> Oh, at least he'll land in

1724
00:52:59,384 --> 00:52:59,593
the water.

1725
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,385
>> You want to make a bet?

1726
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,261
>> What?

1727
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,220
>> If he makes it or not?

1728
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,306
I'll bet you a dollar.

1729
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,600
>> The person that I think I'm

1730
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,143
most like is Boston Rob.

1731
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,020
Seeing Rob here, it reminds me

1732
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,229
of when he played the first

1733
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,439
time-- I loved him.

1734
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,024
Okay.

1735
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:14,608
>> All right?

1736
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,734
>> All right, a dollar.

1737
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:16,318
A dollar that he won't make it

1738
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,278
to the top, and you're saying

1739
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,529
a dollar that he'll do it?

1740
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,488
>> He's going to do it.

1741
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,740
>> That's someone I could see

1742
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,742
myself aligning with until it's

1743
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,494
time to cut his throat.

1744
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,459
>> I bet on you!

1745
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,460
>> What?

1746
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,419
>> I bet that you would make it.

1747
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,713
>> I bet that you'd fall in the

1748
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,297
water.

1749
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,885
>> Oh, he's giving up!

1750
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,678
Oh, no, he's giving up!

1751
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,138
>> You're not a warrior!

1752
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:45,472
Get up there!

1753
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:49,059
>> Get back down, get back down.

1754
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:49,976
>> Man!

1755
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,228
>> Right to Sandra, winner,

1756
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,065
from... from Boston Bob the

1757
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,983
loser.

1758
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,485
>> Boston Bob.

1759
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,779
>> So I bowed out, swallowed my

1760
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:01,905
pride.

1761
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:02,322
It's not worth it.

1762
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,824
Tucked my tail, went back down.

1763
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:05,951
>> Man, you cost me.

1764
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,077
>> I won.

1765
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:07,661
>> I made a bet and I lost.

1766
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,329

1767
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,664
it up to that where it starts

1768
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,706
getting steep.

1769
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,666
>> Coulda, shoulda, woulda,

1770
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:12,874
didn't.

1771
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,500
>> But it's not worth it.

1772
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,877
Could I make it up there? Yes.

1773
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,504
But if I fall off, I mean, why

1774
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,880
risk that?

1775
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:19,506
>> From the Hero to the zero.

1776
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,383

>> Yep.

1778
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,385

1779
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,762
>> From the Villain to the never

1780

that I've got these sexy young

stay strong and compete.

1799

to... (laughs)

I couldn't even roll over

without her rolling over and

1812
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:37,876
putting her arms around me, or

1813

She's becoming a bit annoying.

1828

Nobody really had a good

was three and scared the life

1873
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,071
out of me.

1874
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,364
She took one and grabbed it by

1875
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:31,990
its neck and spun it around and

1876
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,491
and popped its head off and

1877
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:33,908
then it run around.

1878
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:34,659
It was traumatic-- like, we were

1879
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,286
screaming.

1880
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,328
We didn't know what to do.

1881
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:37,954
And I don't know, it was a good

1882
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,247
time.

1883
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:39,789
Kind of... kind of very...

1884
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,457
it was traumatic.

1885
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,419
But it was... it's funny now.

1886
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:45,712
It smells good.

1887
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,463
I can smell it already.

1888
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,507
>> Mmm!

1889
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,800
>> It's pretty good.

1890
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,177
>> It is good. Yeah.

1891
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,428
>> You know, it's little

1892
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,596
victories like the chicken that

1893
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,555
get you fired up.

1894
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,098
It just goes to show we have

1895
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,475
sustainability out here.

1896
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,518
That's a huge thing.

1897
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,728
>> Thank you.

1898
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,396
>> Thanks for cooking, boys.

1899
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:03,938
>> I think the Villains can

1900
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:07,400
stay positive for a short time.

1901
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:09,027
But without fire, without the

1902
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,154
small victories, it's only a

1903
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,447
matter of time before that

1904
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,657
tribe self-destructs.

1905
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,451
>> We're living large on Hero

1906
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:17,994
Beach, James.

1907
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:25,919
It's good to be a Hero.

1908
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:26,586
>> Treemail!

1909
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,339
>> "This challenge is a big one.

1910
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,507
It's not for the stupid or weak.

1911
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,759
You've been here before, so

1912
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,219
save your excuses at Tribal

1913
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:34,886
Council.

1914
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:35,720
Feel free to speak.

1915
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:38,014
Life's tough enough on the

1916
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,599
island, with suffering hunger

1917
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,767
and thirst, so don't add to the

1918
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,144
humiliation by being the one

1919
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,146
who is voted off first."

1920
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,857
Ooh...

1921
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,400
>> The Villains were beaten the

1922
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,902
other day but not broken.

1923
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,695
Today, we build ourselves up

1924
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,406
again to go out there and to

1925
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,243
thrash the Heroes unmercifully.

1926
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,494
>> Today is the difference

1927
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,079
maker in the whole game.

1928
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,080
We gotta win.

1929
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,498
>> Hopefully, we will not only

1930
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,792
defeat them, but we will beat

1931
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,503
them as well, mentally, and...

1932
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,004
turn things around for the

1933
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:10,672
better.

1934
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:11,965
>> Villains!

1935
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:12,674
>> Get your evil on!

1936
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,842
>> I got my evil right here.

1937
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:26,020
>> Yeah.

1938
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:26,729
>> JEFF PROBST: Come on in,

1939
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,815
guys!

1940
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,708
So, Heroes, you guys had fire.

1941
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:47,709
J.T., how's it going?

1942
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,252
Were you able to get fire going?

1943
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,503
>> Yeah, it's been pretty good,

1944
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:51,296
actually.

1945
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,213
We're staying a lot drier than

1946
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,172
I expected.

1947
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:53,798
>> Our roof is pretty thatched

1948
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:56,926
pretty well so we kept dry.

1949
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,720
>> PROBST: Tom, how's the food?

1950
00:59:58,803 --> 00:59:59,804
>> Food's going pretty good.

1951
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,722
We got lucky with a couple of--

1952
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:04,309
one rooster, three hens, had a

1953
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:04,767
nice breakfast today.

1954
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,852
>> PROBST: Rob, what's going on

1955
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,729
over at the Villains' camp?

1956
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,939
>> Yeah, it's not quite as good

1957
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,482
as the way they're talking over

1958
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,483
there.

1959
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,985
Our shelter is terrible.

1960
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,194
>> Well, it's not that bad.

1961
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:15,903
>> It's terrible.

1962
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:16,237
It's terrible.

1963
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,196
>> It's bad.

1964
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,031
It's really bad.

1965
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:18,948
>> PROBST: And therein lies the

1966
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:19,949
difference between Coach, who

1967
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,076
can endure anything, and the

1968
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,619
rest of us who would like

1969
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,704
something to lie down on.

1970
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,705
All right, you guys ready to

1971
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,707
get to your first immunity

1972
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,499
challenge?

1973
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,042
>> Do it.

1974
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:29,250
>> Yeah.

1975
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,626
>> PROBST: All right, for

1976
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,210
today's challenge, six tribe

1977
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,379
members will race to assemble a

1978
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,297
boat.

1979
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,257
You must then use seven planks

1980
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,509
to keep the boat together.

1981
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,761
You'll paddle out, grab a

1982
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,846
torch, paddle back, where you

1983
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,390
will remove the seven planks

1984
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,350
and bring them back to the

1985
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:45,767
start.

1986
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,809
The four remaining tribe

1987
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:47,727
members must then solve a

1988
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,103
puzzle.

1989
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,063
Once you have the puzzle

1990
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,564
completed, you will use those

1991
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,649
planks to build a ladder to

1992
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,610
allow you to place the puzzle

1993
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,653
in its appropriate spot.

1994
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,113
It's then a race to the top.

1995
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,365
First tribe to get all their

1996
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,783
members to the top, light their

1997
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:06,662
fire barrel, wins immunity.

1998
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,539
This is what you want in this

1999
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:08,873
game.

2000
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,833
If you have immunity, you are

2001
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:11,709
safe.

2002
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,127
You can't be voted out.

2003
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:13,836
Without it, you are vulnerable.

2004
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,755
Losing tribe goes to Tribal

2005
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,673
Council where somebody will be

2006
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,218
the first person voted out of

2007
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,095
<i>Survivor: Heroes vs.</i>

2008
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,347
<i>Villains.</i>

2009
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,391
One item of note-- both Candice

2010
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,393
and Parvati have both competed

2011
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:28,935
in this challenge in their

2012
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,396
original season.

2013
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,271
In the Cook Islands they were

2014
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,064
on the same tribe.

2015
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:33,856
They were winners.

2016
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,191
Today they are opponents.

2017
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:35,983
See how it plays out.

2018
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:36,734
I'll give you a minute to

2019
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,652
strategize.

2020
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,737
We'll get started.

2021
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:44,951
All right, here we go.

2022
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,662
At stake, immunity, and for the

2023
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:49,997
Villains, fire if they win.

2024
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,666
Survivors ready?

2025
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:52,291
Go!

2026
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,377
>> Come on, Heroes!

2027
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,714
>> Come on, Villains.

2028
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,841
Get ugly!

2029
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:00,425
>> PROBST: You need all the

2030
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,717
pieces.

2031
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:02,677
You need the planks.

2032
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,011
You need your paddles.

2033
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,097
You need all of it.

2034
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,142
Both tribes doing a good job of

2035
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:09,976
getting all their pieces out in

2036
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,311
the water to start putting this

2037
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:12,770
boat together.

2038
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:15,314
James carrying two by himself.

2039
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,899
>> That goes here...

2040
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:17,942
>> Hold that.

2041
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,944
>> Let's go, guys.

2042
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:20,278
Hey, let's go.

2043
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,737
We've got to put these together.

2044
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,239
>> Let's go, Heroes!

2045
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,574
>> Great job, guys.

2046
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:25,658
>> PROBST: Heroes getting it

2047
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:26,951
together quickly.

2048
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,579
Villains already falling behind.

2049
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:29,996
>> One small hole.

2050
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:30,997
>> That one there?

2051
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,249
>> Yes.

2052
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,167
>> PROBST: Got to get those

2053
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:34,917
planks in.

2054
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:35,918
That's what's keeping your boat

2055
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:36,752
together.

2056
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:37,170
>> That doesn't fit.

2057
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,088

01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,050
>> Yeah, baby!

2246
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,219
Good job, good job!

2247
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:57,346
>> Man!

2248
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:03,102
>> PROBST: Villains,

2249
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:06,313
congratulations.

2250
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,899
Immunity keeps you safe from

2251
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,359
Tribal Council.

2252
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,902
Fire will hopefully get your

2253
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:12,820
camp in order.

2254
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:13,529
>> Yes!

2255
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,071
>> Yeah!

2256
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,614
>> Yes!

2257
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:16,198
>> PROBST: Sugar, three days

2258
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,160
into this game, right on cue,

2259
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,828
you're crying.

2260
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,955
>> Yeah.

2261
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:25,332
>> PROBST: All right, Heroes.

2262
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,625
Tribal Council tonight.

2263
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,918
One of the ten of you will be

2264
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,170
the first person voted out of

2265
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,505
<i>Survivor: Heroes vs.</i>

2266
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,423
<i>Villains.</i>

2267
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:33,090
Grab your stuff.

2268
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:33,966
Head back to camp.

2269
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:34,508
I will see you at Tribal.

2270
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,218
Villains, congratulations.

2271
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:36,594
Grab your stuff.

2272
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:37,136
Head back to camp.

2273
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,929
>> Thank you.

2274
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,681
>> If Sugar's having some sort

2275
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,016
of emotional breakdown on day

2276
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:42,641
three, she's not fit to be out

2277
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,895
here another 36 days.

2278
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,438
Losing her, we're going to

2279
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:49,899
miss...

2280
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:50,983
Yeah, I don't think we're going

2281
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:53,110
to miss much.

2282
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:10,085
>> Yeah, how do you like us now,

2283
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,128
huh?

2284
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,296
>> Yeah!

2285
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:13,756
>> All right!

2286
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:14,965
>> Good job.

2287
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,968
>> Good work.

2288
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:18,511
>> Now, we have a relaxing

2289
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,178
afternoon.

2290
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,263
Nobody has to go cut anybody's

2291
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,890
throat.

2292
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:26,769
We just have a nice nice, huh?

2293
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,270
>> It was exciting to win the

2294
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:29,438
immunity challenge.

2295
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,148
We had to do it because we

2296
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,317
didn't want one of our people

2297
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,151
to be the first to leave

2298
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,237
<i>Heroes vs. Villains.</i>

2299
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,156
Now we're trying to figure out

2300
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,741
who they're going to send home

2301
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,117
and why.

2302
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,244
>> Well, Tom and Stephenie are

2303
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:45,204
together.

2304
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,373
They were together from before.

2305
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,250
James has to be with Cirie and

2306
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:54,839
Amanda and what's the other one?

2307
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:55,381
When push comes to shove and

2308
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,383
nobody wants to go home first,

2309
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,592
it's about who all you've been

2310
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,553
with and who you know.

2311
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:01,303
>> Yeah.

2312
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,429
>> What I like about it is they

2313
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:03,347
all shook up now.

2314
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,683
Now they are divided.

2315
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,852
We have to divide them.

2316
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:10,020
The Heroes got their asses

2317
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,022
handed to them.

2318
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:12,565
And, you know what, we were

2319
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:13,315
having a good time just sitting

2320
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,818
back loving it.

2321
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,361
Oh, I'm happy!

2322
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,113
>> Keep going, keep going.

2323
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,614
>> It strengthens our tribe and

2324
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,324
it weakens the Heroes' tribe.

2325
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,785
>> We looked like a team a

2326
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,203
little bit today.

2327
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:30,165
Like eight out of ten, 80%...

2328
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:31,959
>> A solid B-plus.

2329
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:32,543
>> They got to stab somebody

2330
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,378
in the back.

2331
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:36,046
They're over there being

2332
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,047
villains.

2333
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,174
That's what they're doing.

2334
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:49,810
>> This is not good.

2335
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:50,436
Nobody in a million years would

2336
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,271
have guessed we are going to

2337
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,857
Tribal Council on day three.

2338
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,483
Hopefully, this loss does

2339
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:59,361
nothing to our momentum other

2340
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:00,321
than show us that we're

2341
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,323
vulnerable.

2342
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:04,366
They might be a little more

2343
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,576
sneaky and a little more game

2344
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:07,411
playey and a little more damn

2345
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:08,287
puzzle oriented, and that's

2346
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,371
fine.

2347
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,372
>> Well, they wanted it pretty

2348
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,373
bad.

2349
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,375
>> They needed it.

2350
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,460
>> Yeah.

2351
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,712
>> And we were a little cocky.

2352
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:17,880
We walked in there like the

2353
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:18,797
heroes.

2354
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,341
You know, there's big "S's" on

2355
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,801
all of our chests.

2356
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,682
This<i> Heroes vs. Villains</i> is

2357
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:29,475
going to be a tough one.

2358
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,019
When we thought we had it in

2359
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:34,396
the bag, they showed us we

2360
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,273
don't.

2361
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,734
>> You guys want some coconuts?

2362
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,368
>> Neither was I.

2363
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:49,995
>> What do you think?

2364
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,163
>> Amanda?

2365
01:10:51,246 --> 01:10:51,372
>> Okay.

2366
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,374
>> Okay, we all...?

2367
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:54,708
Well, that's fine with me.

2368
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,001
As long as it's not me.

2369
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:56,585
>> It's freaking awesome with

2370
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,087
me. Please.

2371
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,338
>> Okay.

2372
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,173
>> When we lost, I felt really,

2373
01:11:01,256 --> 01:11:02,216
really awful.

2374
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:02,758
I helped us lose, I guess,

2375
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:04,551
because I was on the puzzle,

2376
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,261
and I felt bad because we had

2377
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,471
such a good lead before.

2378
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:09,431
I just was disappointed in

2379
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,225
myself.

2380
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,686
And scared.

2381
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,354
I don't want to talk to anyone.

2382
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:15,688
>> Me, either.

2383
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,399
>> I'm so depressed right now.

2384
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,401
(laughing)

2385
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:22,903
These are all people, some of

2386
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:23,529
them have all played together

2387
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,532
before, and they're really good.

2388
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,158
And I think that Amanda and

2389
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:28,742
James are together, so we have

2390
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:31,078
to break that up, if at all

2391
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:33,205
possible.

2392
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,006
>> This isn't a bad thing.

2393
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,048
>> No.

2394
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,008
>> I think Sugar.

2395
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,050
I think everyone's thinking

2396
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:45,968
Sugar.

2397
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:48,137
>> Yeah.

2398
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:01,984
>> Is that done?

2399
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:02,776
>> Yeah.

2400
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,485
>> Yeah?

2401
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:04,570
>> Yeah.

2402
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,946
>> What are you thinking?

2403
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,364
>> I'm thinking that you have a

2404
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:08,449
follower and you got one of

2405
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:10,826
the smartest strategic players

2406
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:11,827
in the game.

2407
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:12,870
Why are we taking out the

2408
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:13,954
follower instead of the

2409
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,039
strategic player?

2410
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:15,873
Cirie...

2411
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:16,665
>> Oh, Cirie?

2412
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,042
>> ...has run this game a few

2413
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:20,252
times. So...

2414
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:21,795
I really believe that when you

2415
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,255
identify a threat, you take them

2416
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:24,340
out as soon as possible.

2417
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,300
You don't wait.

2418
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:27,426
People did that on my season,

2419
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:28,719
and they waited too long, and

2420
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:29,803
then they didn't get the

2421
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,096
opportunity to get rid of me.

2422
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,015
So I don't want to have those

2423
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,516
regrets that those people had.

2424
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,018
>> I have no problem.

2425
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:37,311
>> Just a thought.

2426
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:38,187
Just a thought.

2427
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:39,354
>> I'm down with that.

2428
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:40,898
>> Cirie is just a brilliant

2429
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:41,482
strategist in the game.

2430
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,400
She's proven that, so I'm just

2431
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,611
a little nervous to give her a

2432
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:55,871
bye tonight.

2433
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:57,956
>> So I told you three my

2434
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:58,999
concerns about Cirie.

2435
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,834
>> Cirie-- I worry about her the

2436
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:01,877
most.

2437
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,753
>> Right.

2438
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:08,384
>> Cirie's tricky.

2439
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:09,551
>> So, who are<i> we</i> voting for?

2440
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,594
That's what I'm...

2441
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:11,720
>> I like Sugar...

2442
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:12,888
>> They're voting for Sugar?

2443
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,056
>> Who's voting for Sugar?

2444
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,432
>> The other group.

2445
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:16,767
>> Do we need to break up Tom

2446
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:17,893
and Stephenie?

2447
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,144
>> I agree.

2448
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:19,645
Because why waste a vote?

2449
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,147
And you're not going to be able

2450
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:22,981
to get him later.

2451
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,233
So, what are we doing? Tom?

2452
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:25,192
>> Tom or Stephenie.

2453
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:26,110
I'm good with either one.

2454
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:27,236
>> You got to make a decision

2455
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:28,278
which one before we go back,

2456
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:29,363
'cause we're not going to be

2457
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,865
able to talk again.

2458
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,242
>> Word on the street is, Sugar

2459
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:33,784
is supposed to go tonight.

2460
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:35,369
Why Sugar?

2461
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:36,662
Sugar, yes, she's annoying,

2462
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,622
which is even a better reason

2463
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:39,540
for me to keep her around,

2464
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,375
because as long as there's

2465
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:41,834
somebody annoying and

2466
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,585
somebody... less strong than I

2467
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,462
am, then that takes the target

2468
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,464
off of me.

2469
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:51,260
So if we could get one of the

2470
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:52,719
stronger players out, like Tom

2471
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,263
or Stephenie, that would be

2472
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:54,888
better for me.

2473
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,306
So I'd rather not have Sugar go

2474
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,808
tonight.

2475
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:00,602
My concern is, if we don't

2476
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,980
knock one of them out, like

2477
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:03,564
Stephenie, who ca...

2478
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,732
We're going to lose challenges

2479
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:06,608
without Stephenie?

2480
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:06,859
>> Maybe.

2481
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:09,611
She's a really strong swimmer.

2482
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,321
>> And can't-- and Sugar is not?

2483
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:11,738
>> I don't think so.

2484
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:12,614
>> I don't know.

2485
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:16,535
I'm just... you know...

2486
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,162
>> There is an advantage of

2487
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:19,580
keeping Stephenie right now and

2488
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:20,622
getting rid of Sugar,

2489
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,623
physically, like, for the

2490
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,624
challenges.

2491
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:23,625
But strategically, Stephenie

2492
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:26,628
has got game and she has to go.

2493
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,045
You think Stephenie?

2494
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,006
>> The smartest... the smartest

2495
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,424
move right now would be

2496
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:30,716
Stephenie.

2497
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,551
I mean, think about it.

2498
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:33,969
We want to make moves that's

2499
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:36,013
gonna guarantee us, you know,

2500
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:38,891
getting further in this game.

2501
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,684
>> It's so hard, because you

2502
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,935
want to keep your team strong,

2503
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,228
but strategically, you have to

2504
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:43,854
put yourself in a good position.

2505
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:45,939
Either you're doing it for

2506
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:46,940
challenges, or you're going to

2507
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:47,858
get rid of someone for

2508
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:49,902
strategic reasons.

2509
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,112
Or you just don't like them.

2510
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,281
Cirie and I are here for blood,

2511
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:55,157
okay?

2512
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:00,954
We are here to win this thing.

2513
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,081
♪ ♪

2514
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,770
♪ ♪

2515
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,456
>> PROBST: Behind each of you is

2516
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:44,957
a torch.

2517
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,375
Go ahead and grab a torch.

2518
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:46,959
Approach a flame, dip it in,

2519
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,670
and get fire.

2520
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:55,717
This is part of the ritual of

2521
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,345
Tribal Council, because in this

2522
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:00,097
game, as you know, fire

2523
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,224
represents your life.

2524
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:03,558
As long as you have fire,

2525
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:04,101
you're still in the game.

2526
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:06,186
When your fire is gone, so are

2527
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:06,853
you.

2528
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,272
That will be the case for one

2529
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:10,649
of you tonight.

2530
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,485
First, let me just welcome you

2531
01:16:13,568 --> 01:16:13,735
to Tribal.

2532
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:16,405
We're 40 feet in the air in the

2533
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,240
middle of the jungle, no roof.

2534
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:19,741
If it rains, we will get wet.

2535
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,369
As I'm sure will happen once or

2536
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:23,954
twice out here.

2537
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:25,372
I just want to look at some of

2538
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:25,914
the reasons you might vote

2539
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,958
somebody off.

2540
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:29,668
Tom, how big a factor do you

2541
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:32,421
think prior relationships-- you

2542
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,423
and Stephenie, Amanda and

2543
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,133
Cirie, people that have played

2544
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,217
together before that others

2545
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,468
might look at and think: they've

2546
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:39,636
got to be friends, they got to

2547
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,679
be in an alliance, they know

2548
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:41,555
each other?

2549
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,056
>> I think that we all worried

2550
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,266
about that coming into it.

2551
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:45,392
I think it's kind of been

2552
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:46,435
pushed to the side now.

2553
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:47,728
We realize that you just got

2554
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:49,021
to give everybody a clean slate

2555
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,439
and take it from there.

2556
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:51,648
So, I'm not too worried about

2557
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:53,483
the previous relationships.

2558
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:54,401
>> PROBST: Sugar, you haven't

2559
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:55,902
played with anybody.

2560
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,279
Do you buy what Tom's saying?

2561
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:58,947
Is it fine, it's a clean slate?

2562
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,365
"I don't really care if they

2563
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,533
knew somebody else before."

2564
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:02,576
>> Well, I thought that was a

2565
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:03,660
really good speech, but I do

2566
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,704
think that that is definitely a

2567
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,415
factor-- people who have played

2568
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:09,374
together and people who knew

2569
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,375
each other and people who hang

2570
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,626
out, or whatever.

2571
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,169
>> PROBST: What about past

2572
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:13,545
success?

2573
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:14,796
Amanda, you've played twice,

2574
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,132
and you've made it to the end

2575
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:18,342
both times.

2576
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:18,884
Do you find yourself already

2577
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:21,053
trying to deflect some of the

2578
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,805
attention that might be on you?

2579
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:24,973
>> You know, one thing that I

2580
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,183
did do in both my seasons to

2581
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:26,767
get to the end was make loyal

2582
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,602
alliances.

2583
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:30,354
So I think in a way it's a

2584
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,772
positive thing for me.

2585
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,023
And, yeah, I haven't won.

2586
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:34,358
Like, obviously, we all know,

2587
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:35,400
I'm not good at Tribal Council.

2588
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,360
>> Yeah, that was the best

2589
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:37,694
Tribal Council question you've

2590
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:38,570
ever answered.

2591
01:17:38,653 --> 01:17:39,071
>> See? I'm working on it.

2592
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,364
>> You answered that really

2593
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:40,989
correctly.

2594
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:41,740
I'm surprised.

2595
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:42,157
I'd say it out loud.

2596
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,867
>> Shut up, James.

2597
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:44,951
>> That was the best.

2598
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:46,328
>> PROBST: You're surprised and

2599
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:47,079
I'm excited.

2600
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:47,412
>> Obviously.

2601
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:47,996
>> It took me a while, but I'm

2602
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,082
getting the hang of it.

2603
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,625
So, yeah, it's both.

2604
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:52,667
I mean, there's people in this

2605
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:53,585
game that have won.

2606
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:55,212
I mean, come on, you know.

2607
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:57,339
>> PROBST: Cirie, you're the

2608
01:17:57,422 --> 01:17:59,091
woman that stayed at home and

2609
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,926
watched<i> Survivor</i> on the couch.

2610
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,552
And now here you are for the

2611
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:05,055
third time-- yet another reason

2612
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:06,556
to get rid of somebody.

2613
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,683
She's grown into a bona fide

2614
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,060
threat to win the game.

2615
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,770
How do you defend that, first

2616
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,522
Tribal Council?

2617
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,649
>> Well, like you said, Jeff,

2618
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,317
everybody here is a threat.

2619
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:17,901
If they weren't threatening,

2620
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:19,861
they wouldn't be here.

2621
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,321
>> PROBST: Steph, that's really

2622
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:21,947
what we're getting at, at this

2623
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,949
first Tribal Council.

2624
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:24,741
Is there's a reason to get rid

2625
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,743
of every single person up here.

2626
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:29,329
>> Well, I think, as far as

2627
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:30,705
trying to make a decision

2628
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:32,082
tonight, it's the first one,

2629
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,875
and that's the hardest, I think.

2630
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,502
But we don't want to come back

2631
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:36,503
here.

2632
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:37,587
I mean, what I'm doing is I'm

2633
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,213
going to go with who I think is

2634
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:39,798
the weakest for the team right

2635
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:40,924
now.

2636
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:43,051
And will help us stay the

2637
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,553
strongest we can to continue to

2638
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:45,846
win.

2639
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:46,805
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

2640
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:47,931
today's challenge.

2641
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:49,224
James, first half of the

2642
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:50,809
challenge, you guys smoked them

2643
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:51,852
by a long ways.

2644
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:54,646
Then we got to the puzzle.

2645
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:58,150
Amanda, Sugar, Cirie, Rupert--

2646
01:18:58,233 --> 01:18:58,775
disaster.

2647
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,777
>> It's sucked because nobody

2648
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,404
was focusing.

2649
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:03,697
Everybody had their own opinion.

2650
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,906
It was like everybody wanted to

2651
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:06,783
solve the puzzle differently.

2652
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,076
But hopefully, they'll focus

2653
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,494
next time because this just

2654
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,787
can't happen no more.

2655
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,289
>> PROBST: Cirie, if it's you

2656
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,874
tonight, is it fair to take it

2657
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:15,876
because you were one of the

2658
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:16,960
people that blew it on the

2659
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:19,171
puzzle?

2660
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,881
>> I don't think one challenge

2661
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,300
should determine your worth in

2662
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:26,136
the long run of this game.

2663
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:26,845
It could have been Tom and

2664
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,139
Stephenie, and they could have

2665
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:29,890
lost the puzzle.

2666
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:32,017
>> PROBST: Sugar, you were one

2667
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,602
of the four people that blew it

2668
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:33,935
on the puzzle.

2669
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:34,895
>> I know.

2670
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:36,771
>> PROBST: There's no debate

2671
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:37,689
about that.

2672
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:38,607
Would it be fair to say "Voting

2673
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:39,941
Sugar out"?

2674
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,109
>> Well, that's why I was

2675
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,652
crying.

2676
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:43,403
>> PROBST: Because you're

2677
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:44,029
afraid that might be the reason?

2678
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,697
>> Yeah.

2679
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:46,698
>> PROBST: Would that be

2680
01:19:46,781 --> 01:19:47,616
criteria enough for you to get

2681
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:48,241
rid of somebody?

2682
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,619
>> No, not me.

2683
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:51,203
I wouldn't vote somebody out

2684
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,079
just because they were part of

2685
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:54,498
a team that didn't win the

2686
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:55,999
challenge.

2687
01:19:56,082 --> 01:19:57,292
>> PROBST: Candice, you got to

2688
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,460
vote somebody out.

2689
01:19:58,543 --> 01:19:59,711
Does it make it easier for you

2690
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:00,795
to say "Well, I could just

2691
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,088
simply blame it on the puzzle"?

2692
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,048
>> I think the people who

2693
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,008
stepped up to do the puzzle

2694
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:06,343
were pretty brave, so I think

2695
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:07,802
we should appreciate that they

2696
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,638
stepped up to do that and not

2697
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:11,223
start voting people out for

2698
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,140
that because otherwise nobody

2699
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,183
is ever going to do a puzzle.

2700
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:13,934
>> PROBST: Tom, do you vote

2701
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:17,604
tonight based on long-term game

2702
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:19,147
or short-term game?

2703
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,565
>> I think that people are

2704
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,108
developing their relationships,

2705
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:23,568
and kind of everyone is always

2706
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,986
looking towards the endgame,

2707
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,279
but that's not what we're

2708
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:27,989
working on now.

2709
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,699
We're working on staying strong

2710
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,076
with your best people, and

2711
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,410
let's not come back here

2712
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:33,453
anymore and we don't have to

2713
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:34,454
worry about who we're voting

2714
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:35,539
out.

2715
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:36,540
>> PROBST: Candice, a lot of

2716
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:37,123
these people know each other.

2717
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,042
Is the first Tribal Council

2718
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,669
maybe an opportunity to take

2719
01:20:40,752 --> 01:20:42,003
one person out of the equation

2720
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,838
and really change things up?

2721
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:44,422
>> I think the first Tribal

2722
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,508
Council is an opportunity to do

2723
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:47,592
anything.

2724
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,094
We've got ten people here, and

2725
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,512
there's a lot of different

2726
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:51,930
ideas going around.

2727
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:55,016
So, yes...

2728
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,268
Or no.

2729
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,562

clearly there's a legitimate

2732
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,525
reason to vote every single

01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:04,067
person out.

2734
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,986
The only thing left to do is

2735
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:07,112
find out who that person is

2736
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,029
going to be.

2737
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,239
It is time to vote.

2738
01:21:09,322 --> 01:21:11,700
