1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:06,906
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR", KARA, ALISON, AND

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,309
ALEC CONSIDERED WORKING WITH THE
DAVIDS.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,846
WELL GIVE YOU FIRST THREE TO
CREATE AN ALLIANCE WITH THE

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:13,680
DAVIDS.

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,615
Jeff: BUT TRUST WAS AN
ISSUE.

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,551
THERES GOLIATHS IN MY FACE
AGAIN.

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,287
Jeff: AND THE DAVIDS
PREPARED FOR BATTLE.

8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,689
WE HAVE THREE ADVANTAGES.

9
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:26,593
AND WE CANT SCREW UP THIS
VOTE.

10
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:30,530
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THE POWER SHIFTED WHEN NICK

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,132
PLAYED HIS ADVANTAGE.

12
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,300
WHOSE VOTE ARE YOU GOING TO
STEAL?

13
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,636
I THINK ILL TAKE ALISONS
VOTE.

14
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:40,573
Jeff: WHICH CAUSED ALEC AND
KARA TO SAVE FACE WITH THE

15
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:45,145
DAVIDS AND COMPELLED DAN TO PLAY
HIS IDOL.

16
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,012
YOURE PLAYING THIS

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:46,613
FOR YOURSELF?

18
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,281
YES, SIR.

19
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,384
Jeff: BUT IT WAS BLOCKED BY
A NEW ADVANTAGE, THE IDOL

20
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,652
NULLIFIER.

21
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,755
THIS NULLIFIER WAS PLAYED
AGAINST DAN.

22
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,624
OH, MY GOD.

23
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,959
Jeff: BING.

24
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:00,994
SENDING DAN TO THE JURY.

25
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:05,799
DAN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

26
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,900
TEN ARE LEFT.

27
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,937
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

28
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,945
ANOTHER EPIC TRIBAL.

29
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,414
TWO ADVANTAGES PLAYED
CORRECTLY.

30
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,716
HOW RARE IS THAT?

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,485
OH, MY GOD.

32
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,653
CONGRATULATIONS.

33
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,887
WELL PLAYED.

34
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,758
PLAYING THAT NULLIFIER AND
PLAYING IT TO PERFECTION FELT

35
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,026
GREAT.

36
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:37,330
HELL, I FEEL I SHOULD GO DOWN IN
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY FOR THAT ONE.

37
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,998
THEY NEVER SEEN IT COMING.

38
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:43,369
NOW THAT WE HAVE NUMBERS EVEN AT
5-5, HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP OUT

39
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,406
FOOT ON THEIR THROATS AND BURY
THEM AND RIDE OFF INTO THE

40
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,340
SUNSET.

41
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,543
DO YOU GUYS WANT TO EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED?

42
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,279
WE SWITCHED THE NAME FROM THE
GOLIATH TRIBE.

43
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,447
I DIDNT VOTE TONIGHT.

44
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,215
OKAY.

45
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:55,482
AND?

46
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,649
ME?

47
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,685
YEP.

48
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:07,894
HAVING YOUR ALLIANCE STAB YOU
IN THE BACK DOESNT FEEL GOOD.

49
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:13,600
AND I WILL WITHOUT HESITATION
WRITE ANY OF THEIR NAMES DOWN AS

50
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,802
QUICKLY AND AS SOON AS I CAN.

51
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,606
THE ONLY REASON THEY CAST
THOSE VOTES FOR ME IS TO MAKE IT

52
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,108
LOOK LIKE THEY WERE STILL WITH
YOU GUYS SO THEY COULD COME

53
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,877
BECOME AND HAVE A STORY TO TELL.

54
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,913
IM IN THE A SCORNED WOMAN,
BECAUSE I CAN HANDLE VOTES AND

55
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:31,818
BLIND SIDES AND BACKSTAB, BUT
THAT IS WHAT I NEED YOU TO KNOW.

56
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,752
GOT IT.

57
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,288
THE GOLIATH TRIBE IS DEAD AS
DEAD CAN BE.

58
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,857
I DONT THINK THEY KNOW HOW
VICIOUS I CAN, BE BUT THEYRE

59
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:49,235
GOING TO FIND OUT VERY SOON.

60
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:58,144
THE ONLY PEOPLE AWAKE ARE ME
AND DAVIE.

61
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,615
COME ON, SOMEBODY PLAYS AN IDOL,
ITS VERY LIKELY ANOTHER ONE IS

62
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,885
OUT THERE.

63
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,788
I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE IN
THIS AREA BECAUSE NOTHING HAS

64
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,991
BEEN HIDDEN HERE YET.

65
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,994
ME AND NICK WANT TO HAVE AS MANY
ADVANTAGES AS WE CAN IN THIS

66
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,565
GAME, MANLY FOR ME BECAUSE I
SUCK AT THESE DAMN IMMUNITY

67
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,436
CHALLENGES.

68
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,973
MOST OF THE CLUES HAVE BEEN
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND.

69
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:31,044
AT FIRST WE CONTINUE TO SEE
ANYTHING AND WERE GETTING

70
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,314
NERVOUS BECAUSE THE GOLIATHS ARE
GETTING READY TO WAKE UP.

71
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,115
HOLY CRAP.

72
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,183
IM SO STOKED.

73
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,719
ALL IM THINKING IS FINALLY I
FOUND AN IDOL.

74
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,621
BUT ITS NOT AN IDOL.

75
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,856
ITS AN IDOL CLUE.

76
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,625
SO IT SAYS, "CONGRATULATIONS.

77
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,528
YOU HAVE FOUND THE CLUE TO A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

78
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,330
IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO BE
DARING.

79
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,566
TONIGHT WHILE THE OTHERS SLEEP,
YOU MUST SNEAK OUT OF CAMP.

80
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,238
YOUR IDOL AWAITS AT THE ISLANDS
FURTHEST POINT.

81
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,472
LOOK FOR THE FLAME.

82
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,274
GOOD LUCK."

83
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,809
THATS SO FRUSTRATING.

84
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,246
I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TONIGHT.

85
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,414
ITS GOING TO BE HARD TO SNEAK
OUT OF CAMP.

86
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,550
ITS GOING TO TAKE SOME
CREATIVITY.

87
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,085
ILL DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO,
EVEN IF IT MEANS STAYING UP ALL

88
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,121
NIGHT TO FIND THIS THING.

89
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:39,579
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

90
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,413
ALL RIGHT.

91
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,415
LETS GET TO TODAYS REWARD

92
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,451

102
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,148

OH, YEAH.

FEET ON THE BOTTOM ROPE USING

Jeff: MIKE MOVING SLOWLY
WHILE DAVIE CONTINUES TO RIP

182
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,908

183
00:07:55,942 --> 00:08:01,948
VERY FAST TIME FOR DAVIE.

184
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,782
GO, PURPLE.

185
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,983
PURPLE HAS EVERYBODY ACROSS.

186
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,686
MIKE STILL WORKING FOR ORANGE.

187
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,021
PURPLE GETS TO THE PLATFORM.

188
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,256
GO, PURPLE.

189
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,859
NICK GOING TO JUMP OUT NOW FOR
THE FINAL STAGE OF THIS

190
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:13,593
CHALLENGE.

191
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,928
PURPLE WITH A BIG TIME
ADVANTAGE.

192
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:20,766
START THROWING THOSE RUNGS.

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,734
MIKE IS ACROSS.

194
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,735
GO, CHRISTIAN.

195
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,304
CHRISTIAN THE FIFTH AND FINAL
MEMBER FOR ORANGE.

196
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,272
NICK TOSSES.

197
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,006
THATS NO GOOD.

198
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,474
ITS GOT TO BE LEVEL.

199
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,810
CHRISTIAN GOING VERY
AGGRESSIVELY, TRYING TO MAKE UP

200
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,947
SOME TIME.

201
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,750
NICK LANDS THE FIRST LADDER
RUNG.

202
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,951
COME ON CHRISTIAN.

203
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:44,056
Jeff: PURPLE DOWN TO TWO
LADDER RUNGS.

204
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,525
CHRISTIAN ANEN CREDIBLY FAST
TIME.

205
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,092
GO, ORANGE.

206
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,293
NICK GOING TO TRY AGAIN.

207
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,061
JUST MISSES.

208
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,297
IT IS ALEC IN THE WATER FOR
ORANGE NOW.

209
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,999
NICK WITH A ONE-RUNG LEAD.

210
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,268
THERE ARE THREE RUNGS TOTAL.

211
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,837
HERE GOES ALEC.

212
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,007
NO, THAT WONT WORK, ALEC.

213
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,379
NICK ANOTHER CONNECTION, BUT
ITS LOPSIDED.

214
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,948
ALEC HAS THE FIRST LADDER RUNG.

215
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,416
WE ARE TIED 1-1.

216
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,952
IT WOULD BE A HUGE COMEBACK FOR
ORANGE.

217
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,322
GO GET IT, GO GET IT, GO GET
IT.

218
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,990
Jeff: NICK NOW GOING TO
SWAP OUT.

219
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,258
HERE COMES DAVIE.

220
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,328
ALEC GOING TO TRY AGAIN.

221
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:22,862
OH.

222
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,963
YOU ALMOST HAD IT.

223
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,600
Jeff: IT IS DAVIE FOR
PURPLE AND HE LANDS IT ON HIS

224
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,167
FIRST ONE.

225
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,635
IT IS 2-1.

226
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,403
ALEC SCORES HIS SECOND.

227
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,470
WE ARE TIED AGAIN.

228
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,107
ALEC CAN WIN IT AND HE DOES.

229
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,443
ORANGE WINS REWARD.

230
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:43,416
WHAT A COMEBACK FROM ORANGE.

231
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:48,588
ALISON, GABBY, MIKE, ALEC,
CHRISTIAN, NICE AFTERNOON, PLANS

232
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,089
FOR YOU, "SURVIVOR" PICNIC.

233
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:50,690
HEAD TO THE BEACH.

234
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,691
THE BOAT WILL PICK YOU UP.

235
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,161
THANK YOU.

236
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,197
DAVIE, CARL, CARBACK ANGELINA,
NICK, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

237
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,765
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

238
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,403
I HAD A CHANCE TO PROVE RIGHT
THERE IN MY GRASP AND IT GOT

239
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,771
AWAY BECAUSE OF ALEC.

240
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,106
HES A CHALLENGE KING.

241
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,508
HES PROVEN THAT TIME AND TIME
AGAIN.

242
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,777
SO FIRST CHANCE YOU GET TO GET
HIM OUT OF HERE, YOU GET HIM OUT

243
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,279
OF HERE.

244
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,992
WINNER, WINNER, WINNER.

245
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,927
OH, YEAH.

246
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,732
OH, MY GOD.

247
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,102
OH.

248
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,103
CONGRATULATIONS.

249
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,238
THANK YOU GUYS FOR ALL THE
SUPPORT.

250
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,539
ESPECIALLY ALEC.

251
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,576
REWARD CHALLENGE COULDNT
HAVE GONE ANY BETTER.

252
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,810
WE ALL CONTRIBUTED.

253
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,245
EVERYONE DID SO WELL.

254
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,080
IM SO GRATEFUL WE HAD ALEC ON
OUR TEAM.

255
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,782
I WAS THE STAR OF THE SHOW.

256
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,984
SO RIGHT NOW IS A CHANCE TO
CAPITALIZE ON THAT.

257
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,554
WE DONT HAVE THE NUMBERS RIGHT
NOW, AND ANGELINA IS PLAYING

258
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,789
WITH THE DAVIDS.

259
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,625
I NEED TO GET THIS RELATIONSHIP
GOING WITH CHRISTIAN AND GABBY

260
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
AGAIN.

261
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,297
WITH YOUR NAME POPPING UP AT
TRIBAL, I WAS NOT A PART OF THAT

262
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:05,698
AT ALL.

263
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,400
OKAY.

264
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:11,871
WHEN IM BAR TENDING AND IM
FLIRTING WITH A GIRL, E-MAIL

265
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,039
WORKING FOR THE TIP.

266
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:17,543
RIGHT NOW CHRISTIAN AND GABBY
ARE SITTING ACROSS THE BAR.

267
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,147
THEYRE THE TWO HOTTEST GIRLS
IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

268
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,217
IM PUTTING THE CHARM ON AND IM
WORKING FOR THEIR FREAKIN

269
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:25,885
NUMBERS RIGHT NOW.

270
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,286
IM OVER THE DAVID-GOLIATH.

271
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,057
I WAS STRADDLING ONE LEG IN
ONE CAMP AND ONE LEG IN ANOTHER.

272
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,793
NOW I FEEL LIKE IVE TOTALLY
COMMITTED.

273
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,994
ITS EXCITING.

274
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,328
ITS REALLY EXCITING.

275
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,365
NOW THAT THE TABLES HAVE
TURNED, OF COURSE THE GOLIATHS

276
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,866
WANT TO WORK WITH US.

277
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,334
THEY HELD ALL THE POWER BEFORE.

278
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,871
AND THEY COULD KIND OF JERK US
AROUND AS LONG AS THEY WANTED.

279
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,207
BUT NOW THE DAVIDS HAVE THE
POWER.

280
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,378
SO IT ALMOST FORCES THEIR HAND
IN A WAY TO PLAY WITH US, WHICH

281
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:57,016
IS GREAT, BECAUSE I HAVE MORE
OPTIONS NOW.

282
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,418
HOW MUCH DID YOU EAT?

283
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,087
OH, MY GOD, E-MAIL SO FAT.

284
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,055
NO, WAY.

285
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,557
NO, WAY.

286
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,691
OH, MY GOD.

287
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,860
ARE THERE LETTERS?

288
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,262
OH, MY GOD.

289
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:10,963
OH, MY GOD.

290
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,433
OH, MY GOD, I LOVE MY FAMILY.

291
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,970
THANK YOU FOR WINNING THIS.

292
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,073
I KNOW THAT YOU FEEL
EMBARRASSED WHEN WE SAY IT, BUT

293
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:28,180
WE LOVE YOU, AN WE ARE VERY
PROUD OF YOU.

294
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,484
IM PROUD THAT YOU DECIDED TO
DO SOMETHING AND STUCK WITH IT.

295
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,121
A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST THINK
AND TALK.

296
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,355
YOU ACTUALLY DO.

297
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,325
I AM WRITING TO MY SON, WHO
HAS ACHIEVED ONE OF HIS GOALS TO

298
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,693
PLAY THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR."

299
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,961
GREAT JOB.

300
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:47,099
MY DAD SAID, HEY, FIND AN IDOL,
WIN A BIG FEAST, MAKE JEFF

301
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,234
LAUGH.

302
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,970
I THINK IVE DONE ALL THREE OF
THOSE THINGS ALREADY.

303
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:55,274
READING THESE LETTERS REALLY
DOES SORT OF ADD MOTIVATION FOR

304
00:12:55,307 --> 00:13:00,045
ME TO SAY, HEY, LOOK, I CAN WIN
THIS, ITS GOING TO BE HARD,

305
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,349
JUST KNOW WERE HOME PULLING FOR
YOU AND TAKE SOME OF OUR

306
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,250
STRENGTH.

307
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,119
ITS GOING TO REQUIRE ME TO
BURN PEOPLE.

308
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:12,691
ITS GOING TO MEAN I HAVE TO
MAKE HARD DECISIONS.

309
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:18,230
I WANT TO PROVE NOW PEOPLE
SHOULDNT UNDERESTIMATE ME, THAT

310
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:32,945
IM A FORCE IN THIS GAME.

311
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,214
NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I THINK
NOT CATCHING FISH WOULD BE MORE

312
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,617
THAN JUST A BAD DAY.

313
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,185
ITS STARVATION.

314
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:44,557
STARVATION FOR REAL.

315
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,094
ITS FRUSTRATING TO GO FROM A
HIGH FROM TRIBAL TO, YOU KNOW, A

316
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,064
HE OF YET ANOTHER DAY OF NO
FOOD, YOU KNOW?

317
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,333
I MEAN, ITS TOUGH, MAN.

318
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,702
26 DAYS, IT AINT EASY.

319
00:13:56,735 --> 00:14:01,073
AND YOU CAN BE A MILLIONAIRE, A
BILLIONAIRE OR A HOMELESS PERSON

320
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,741
ON THE STREET.

321
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,909
IN FLOOD IS IN FOOD.

322
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,244
YOU CANT PREPARE FOR THAT.

323
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,613
BUT I CAME HERE TO WIN.

324
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:14,320
I GUESS TODAY IS MY MOMENT, BUT
IT WILL JUST MAKE ME STRONGER.

325
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,224
IT JUST MAKES ME STRONGER.

326
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:22,228
CHEER, GUYS.

327
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,231
LOSER CHEERS.

328
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,166
SORRY WE DIDNT COME BACK.

329
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,336
KARA, DO YOU THINK HE HAS AN
IDOL?

330
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:30,836
WHO?

331
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,838
ALEC?

332
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,873
WHY?

333
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,343
IF ALEC DOESNT WIN, THEN I
WANT TO GET HIM OUT.

334
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,379
HE IS A CHALLENGE BEAST.

335
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,447
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

336
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,483
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

337
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,051
HES A THREAT.

338
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,921
CARL MAKES THE PLAN THAT ITS
GOING TO BE ALEC.

339
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,924
IM LOOKING AT THEM, AN IM
LIKE, WERE REALLY JUST TALKING

340
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,460
ABOUT THIS OUT LOUD IN FRONT OF
ME?

341
00:14:54,493 --> 00:15:01,333
LIKE YOU KNOW THAT IM CLOSEST
WITH ALEC AT THIS POINT.

342
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,937
CARL IS VERY CONFIDENT AFTER
THAT LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, BUT

343
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,774
WHEN YOURE OVERCONFIDENT IN
THIS GAME, I KNOW FOR A FACT, AS

344
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:20,019
A GOLIATH, THAT IT DOESNT
ALWAYS GO IN YOUR FAVOR.

345
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,589
IM GOING TO WIN JUST TO PUT
THE CHERRY ON TOP.

346
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,990
CARLS COMING AFTER ME.

347
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,358
IS THAT A SCARY THING?

348
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,993
YEAH, ITS A SUPER SCARY THING.

349
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:32,564
SO ALL THATS ON MY MIND IS I
MOST LIKELY NEED TO WIN THIS

350
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,699
NEXT IMMUNITY.

351
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,568
ITS ANEN SETTLING KIND OF
FEELING JUST TO KNOW THAT YOUR

352
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,604
PRIMARY TARGET NUMBER ONE RIGHT
NOW.

353
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,640
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, WHEN I
WAS AT THE REWARD, I ATE TOO

354
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,341
MUCH.

355

OH, MAN.

357
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,119
I JUST CANT WAIT FOR EVERYBODY

358
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,121
HAVE TO GO GET THIS IDOL.

359
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,222
THANK GOD.

360
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,458
SO PEOPLE THAT WENT ON THE
REWARD ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT

361
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:03,329
THEIR TOM Mac, AN THEY ATE TOO
MUCH TOO FAST, LIKE ALISON IS

362
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,866
THROWING UP EVERYWHERE.

363
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,002
SHE OVERDID IT.

364
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,072
SHE EALT TOO MUCH.

365
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,073
-- SHE ATE TOO MUCH.

366
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:26,885
SO THERE IS A BIT OF DISTRACTION
ALREADY.

00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,423
[SNORING]
IN MY REAL LIFE, IT IS FUN TO

368
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,995
GET OUT HERE AND BE MISCHIEVOUS,
BE A CRIMINAL AN SNEAK OFF.

369
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:39,498
I DONT WANT TO PUT MY GAME IN
JEOPARDY BY DOING MISCHIEVOUS

370
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,567

00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,164
I WALKED FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH
THIS WHOLE TIME IVE BEEN HERE.

383
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,233

IS THE ONE THAT I CAN WIN, AND

530
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:57,429
ITS KILLING ME, BECAUSE I DONT

531
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,498
Jeff: WHAT YOU DON KNOW IS
HOW CLOSE THEY ARE.

532
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,632
EXACTLY.

533
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,733
Jeff: DOES ALEC HAVE
ANOTHER HOUR OR IS HE DOWN TO A

534
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,368
MINUTE LEFT?

535
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,471
IM NOT GOING TO STEP OFF
UNTIL I WIN.

536
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,674
I WONT STEP OFF.

537
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,976
Jeff: GABBY, KEEP FIGHTING,
YOURE THERE.

538
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,977
YOURE A WARRIOR.

539
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,612
IM GOING TO WIN IT.

540
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,479
IM GOING TO WIN IT.

541
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,714
OH, MY GOSH.

542
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,349
OH, MY GOSH.

543
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,352
BEAST MODE, GABBY, BEAST

00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,721
YOURE STRONG, GAB.

545
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,422
IM GOING TO STEP OFF.

546
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,057
GABBY, DONT LET GO.

547
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,260
OH, MY GOSH.

548
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,160
DAMN.

549
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:33,031
Jeff: GABBY FALLS OUT AND
TO THE GROUND.

550
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,699
OH, GABBY.

551
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,569
TWO HOURS AND 30 MINUTES INTO
THIS CHALLENGE.

552
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:42,908
WE ARE DOWN TO A SHOWDOWN, DAVID
VERSUS GOLIATH.

553
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:47,078
CHRISTIAN VERSUS ALEC FOR
IMMUNITY.

554
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,948
DUDE, YOU ARE A BEAST, BY THE
WAY.

555
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,082
YOURE AMAZING.

556
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:58,423
YOURE NOT GOING TO WIN.

557
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:04,496
Jeff: WERE WAY PAST PAIN
THRESHOLD.

558
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,998
YOUR BODIES ARE NUMB NOW.

559
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:07,432
THREE HOURS.

560
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,568
THREE HOURS.

561
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,369
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: WE ARE DEEP ENOUGH

562
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,507

SO WHATEVER YOURE DOING TO STAY
MENTALLY CONNECTED, YOU BETTER

565
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,479
DO IT.

566
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,347
JEFF?

567
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,448
YES.

568
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,018
IS IT OKAY IF I TELL A STORY
TO PASS THE TIME?

569
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:32,791
SO I WAS WORKING ON A PROJECT
THAT WAS ABOUT PLANT ROOT

570
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:33,425
GROWTH.

571
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,526
STAY FOCUSED, CHRISTIAN.

572
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,928
THIS HELPS ME FOCUS, CARL,
THANK YOU.

SO ITS MY JOB TO QUICKLY
THROW TOGETHER A PLANT ROBOT.

575
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:46,972
SO IM TAKING A BUNCH OF
PARTS... BASICALLY I HAD TO TELL

576
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:51,109
PEOPLE... ITS ONE THING TO HAVE
A ROBOT... WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

577
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,378
EXEO SKELETON RESEARCH.

578
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,447
WHO IS UP FOR 20 QUESTIONS?

579
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,816
I START TO LOOK AT THIS AS A
DIFFERENT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY.

580
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,250
YOURE MY CAPTIVE AUDIENCE.

581
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:05,256
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A REUBEN
SANDWICH IS, JEFF?

582
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,459
I NEVER GREW A BEARD IN MY LIFE.

583
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:11,429
JEFF, NOW YOU KNOW WHAT ITS
LIKE TO HEAR MY VOICE FOR HOURS.

584
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,432
TORTURE.

585
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,536
Jeff: BEEN UP THERE FOR
FIVE HOURS.

586
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,139
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

587
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,340
OH, MY GOD.

588
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,175
I DONT FEEL GOOD.

589
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,680
WHAT ON EARTH?

590
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:35,987
THATS INCREDIBLE.

591
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,057
CHRISTIAN?

592
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,791
YOURE SAFE.

593
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,660
IM NOT.

594
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,596
I KNOW.

595
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:51,269
I KNOW HOW YOU MUST FEEL IN THIS
MOMENT, AND I HEAR YOU.

596
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:57,942
I JUST... I MIGHT NEVER GET THIS
OPPORTUNITY AGAIN.

597
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:58,677
IM SORRY.

598
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:08,753
IM SORRY.

599
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:12,123
Jeff: ALEC JUST DROPS OUT.

600
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,458
CHRISTIAN CANT BELIEVE IT.

601
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:17,662
CHRISTIAN HAS JUST WON
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY AFTER FIVE

602
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:21,332
AND A HALF EPIC HOURS.

603
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,534
NO IDEA WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

604
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,135
WHAT A STRANGE TURN OF EVENTS.

605
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,905
WHAT HAPPENED?

606
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,007
ALEC JUST STEPPED OFF.

607
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,810
Jeff: CONGRATULATION,
CHRISTIAN.

608
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:32,410
WELL EARNED.

609
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:32,811
WELL FOUGHT.

610
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,045
THANK YOU.

611
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,748
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, GET OVER
HERE.

612
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:41,086
GOOD JOB, CHRISTIAN.

613
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,555
DAY 27, INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS
YOURS.

614
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:44,789
YOU ARE SAFE IN THIS GAME.

615
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,093
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, YOU HAVE
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW TO FIGURE

616
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:52,363
OUT WHO IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT
PERSON VOTED OUT.

617
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,866
TOMORROW NIGHT, TRIBAL COUNCIL,
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE FOURTH

618
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,734
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

619
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,368
THE GOOD NEWS IS IT WONT BE
YOU.

620
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,070
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

621
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,206
SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT AT
TRIBAL.

622
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,373
CONGRATS.

623
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,311
I WON IMMUNITY, AND IT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH ALSO UMS.

624
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,280
IT WAS JUST I WANTED IT MORE
THAN ALEC.

625
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,550
ALEC IS SUCH AN OBVIOUS TRAR GET
FOR THIS VOTE BECAUSE HES SUCH

626
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,754
A STRONG IMMUNITY THREAT, BUT
WHEN YOURE SITTING AROUND FOR A

627
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,790
FULL DAY, THATS A LOT OF TIME
FOR PLANS TO CHANGE.

628
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,009
THE IMMUNITY IDOL -- IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE YESTERDAY WAS NOSE

629
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,978
FRUSTRATING THING.

630
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,715
I STEPPED UP ON THAT PERCH AND I
SAID IM NOT LETTING GO UNTIL I

631
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,284
WIN.

632
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,820
MENTALLY I COULDNT HANDLE IT.

633
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,089
PEOPLE SEE ME AS A PHYSICAL
THREAT.

634
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,292
ME STANDING ON THE PERCH FOR SIX
HOURS SEALED MY OWN FATE.

635
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,060
I SHOULDNT HAVE LET GO.

636
00:29:56,094 --> 00:30:02,400
YOU BODY COULDNT GO ANYMORE,
AT LEAST MEDICALLY.

637
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,436
I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT PEOPLE
ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

638
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,705
IT SUCKS.

639
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:14,112
I DIDNT COME OUT HERE TO BE
LIKE SOME UNANIMOUS VOTE.

640
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:18,550
I DIDNT COME OUT HERE TO HAVE
PEOPLE JUST SAY, HIM.

641
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:23,855
NO, IM NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.

642
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:27,325
ALEC IS WHO WERE GOING
AFTER, 100%.

643
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,028
100%.

644
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,129
HES A BEAST.

645
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,765
YOU KNOW, IM NOT OF COURSING
TO SUGAR COAT THINGS.

646
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,733
THE NEXT VOTE IS ALEC.

647
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,671
IT SHOULD NOT BE NO TURNS, NO
DETOURS, ALL GO TO TRIBAL, WRITE

648
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:40,805
DOWN ALECS NAME.

649
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,240
LET JEFF READ THE VOTE.

650
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,176
WE CAN ALL COME BACK TO THE
BEACH AND RELAX.

651
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,949
HES A BEAST, WE DONT GET HIM
OUT, WE DONT STAND A CHANCE.

652
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,218
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT FOR
SO LONG?

653
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,386
ARE YOU GOING TO TRUST THIS
BRAND-NEW GIRL?

654
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,656
CARL HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE A
CONTROLLING PLAYER.

655
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,026
I CALL HIM THE GODFATHER BECAUSE
I FEEL LIKE WITHIN THE DAVIDS HE

656
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,394
LIKES TO CALL THE SHOTS.

657
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,964
THIS VOTE SHOULD BE VERY,
VERY SIMPLE.

658
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,332
WHATS HAPPENING?

659
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,533
HES DISCUSSING THE VOTE.

660
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,734
WHATS HE DISCUSSING?

661
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,569
WERE GOING TO VOTE FOR ALEC.

662
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,837
OKAY.

663
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,674
ONE OF US GOT TO GO HOME, WE
SHOULD BE THANKFUL IT AINT NONE

664
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,475
OF US.

665
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,142
SO THATS IT.

666
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,310
YEAH.

667
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,547
ITS LIKE DONT TELL KARA,
WHO IS AN ALLY OF THE PERSON

668
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,482
WHOSE NAME YOURE THROWING OUT.

669
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:25,717
THATS INFURIATING.

670
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,719
DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT GAME WERE
PLAYING.

671
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:28,720
WERE IN "SURVIVOR."

672
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,555
I DIDNT THINK WE WERE TELLING
KARA.

673
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,924
I FELT SO STUPID WALKING UP ON
THAT.

674
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,893
THE ONLY SMART THING IS TO
USE THEM.

675
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,795
DUDE, IM CURIOUS WHY KARA
HAD TO KNOW.

676
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,864
ITS BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY.

677
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,534
THAT MAKES ME FEEL EVEN
STUPIDER BECAUSE THATS FIRST

678
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,769
TIME IVE HEARD OF IT.

679
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,205
YOURE TOO EMOTIONAL AND TOO
PARANOID.

680
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:52,644
IM NOT BEING PARANOID TO
WALK UP ON A CONVERSATION.

681
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,847
SHE DIDNT FEEL LIKE SHE KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS WALKING INTO IN

682
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,384
THAT CONVERSATION, AND SO AS A
RESULT SHES LIKE, THE THINGS

683
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,754
THAT SHE THOUGHT --
 CHRISTIAN, YOU WERE IN THE

684
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:03,588
CONVERSATION.

685
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,690
GABBY IS ONE OF MY CLOSEST
ALLIES.

686
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,960
SO MUCH OF MY JOB IS MAKING SURE
THAT GABBY IS HAPPY, BUT RIGHT

687
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,261
NOW SHES QUITE UPSET.

688
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,764
I REALLY CANT WORK WITH HIM.

689
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,432
GABBY...

690
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:20,571
HE JUST FREAKIN BOSSES ME
AROUND.

691
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,308
HES ALLOWED TO GO TALK TO OTHER
PEOPLE BUT IM NOT?

692
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,709
IT PISSES ME OFF.

693
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:29,614
I FIND CARL TO BE COMING
INCREASINGLY PROBLEMATIC.

694
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,384
HES BOTH AN ALLIANCE LIABILITY
AND PERHAPS A PERSONAL LIABILITY

695
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:38,323
BECAUSE CARL AND GABBY ARE ON A
COLLISION COURSE.

696
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,825
ITS JUST HARD KNOWING ITS YOU,
BUT IF THERE IS ONE THING I

697
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,128
REALIZE, WHEN EVERYONE WANTS YOU
OUT, ITS NEVER THAT EASY.

698
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,229
YEAH.

699
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,966
I THINK THERE ARE BIGGER
THREATS THAT ARE USING MY

700
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,035
PHYSICALITY AS LIKE A SCREEN FOR
THEM.

701
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:51,869
YEAH.

702
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,038
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF ALL THE
DAVIDS?

703
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,239
CARL.

704
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,508
CARL WAS THE ONE WHO CAME
BACK TO CAMP AND SAID, IT NEEDS

705
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,144
TO BE ALEC.

706
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,014
CARL IS THE ONE WHO CAME UP WITH
THE PLAN TO VOTE ME OUT.

707
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:07,452
CARL WAS THE ONEHWHO GOT DAN OUT
WITH THE IDOL NULLIFIER.

708
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,921
I THINK HES RIGHT NOW BLINDED
BY POWER.

709
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,456
WHEN YOU GET COCKY, YOURE GOING
TO GET BLINDSIDED.

710
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:22,000
I THINK SOMEONE LIKE CARL, HE
WOULDNT BE EXPECTING IT.

711
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,669
IM JUST SAYING, HE WOULD
NEVER EXPECT IT.

712
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:29,674
PEOPLE AT THIS POINT KNOW IM
GOING HOME.

713
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,576
WE NEED TWO VOTES, CHRISTIAN AND
GABBY.

714
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,944
IM IN.

715
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:37,315
IF I DONT PULL SOMETHING OUT
OF THE HAT, IM GOING HOME.

716
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,751
SO IM GOING TO DO WHAT I NEED
TO DO TO KEEP MY BUTT IN THIS

717
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:40,385
GAME.

718
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,519
WE SHOULD VOTE OUT CARL.

719
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,387
WHY CANT WE?

720
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,621
HES THE REAL THREAT.

721
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:47,525
BUT WHY CANT WE?

722
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:51,996
I TOLL KARA, ALISON AND MIKE,
IF WE CAN TAKE OUT CARL, WOULD

723
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,100
YOU BE ON BOARD, AND THEY ALL
LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, 1,000%.

724
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,303
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE A BIG
THREAT LIKE HIM GO OUT.

725
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,407
CARL IS A DIFFICULT ALLIANCE
MEMBER TO WORK WORK SO ID BE

726
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,476
LYING IF I SAID I DIDNT THINK
ABOUT THAT.

727
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,147
THE THING I WORRY ABOUT IS THAT
IF YOURE GONE, ITS GOING TO BE

728
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:14,118
A TOUGH ROAD FOR ME INCH A
SELFISH WAY, HAVING YOU AND ME

729
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,321
AROUND IS WAY SORT OF DIFFUSING
THE TARGET.

730
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,525
TO GET RID OF ALEC NOW TAKES
ONE MORE THREAT OFF THE BOARD,

731
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,729
BUT IVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT IN
ORDER FOR ME TO SURVIVE, I HAVE

732
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,598
TO KEEP THREATS AROUND OR ELSE I
WILL BE THE ONLY THREAT

733
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,833
REMAINING.

734
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:32,870
AS OF TODAY, IT SEEMS LIKE HE
HAS THE POWER TO CHOOSE WHICH

735
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,771
ALLIANCE WE GO WITH.

736
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,774
ITS A CRITICAL TIME TO DO
IT.

737
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:40,078
AT THIS POINT OF THE GAME TRIBAL
ALLIANCES ARE FINALLY BLURRED TO

738
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,680
THE POINT WHERE ITS LIKE TWO
LIQUIDS THAT JUST MIX.

739
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:46,751
AN YOU HAVE TO START FIGURING
OUT WHATS BEST FOR YOUR OWN

740
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:47,852
GAME GOING FORWARD.

741
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:48,853
ITS YOU AND ME.

742
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,689
WERE IN THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO
DO IT TOGETHER.

743
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,391
AND WE HAVE TO PENDULUM SWING
TOGETHER AND IT WILL BE

744
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,159
STRESSFUL AS HELL.

745
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,862
THIS IS MAKE-OR-BREAK POINT
IN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH ALEC FOR

746
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:58,930
SURE.

747
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:03,468
EITHER IWILL BE VOTING WITH HIM
OR SENDING HIM HOME.

748
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,504
THIS GAME IS ABOUT TO GET VERY
DYNAMIC VERY QUICKLY.

749
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,803
Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

750
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:49,747
ELIZABETH, JOHN, AND DAN VOTED
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

751
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,715
ALL RIGHT.

752
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,416
LETS START WITH THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

753
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:56,020
ITS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE WE
HAVE HAD A CHALLENGE GO NEARLY

754
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,321
SIX HOURS.

755
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,624
CHRISTIAN, ON YOUR WAY TO
ULTIMATELY WINNING, YOU WERE

756
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,027
VERY OPEN AND VULNERABLE IN
SAYING, I COULD ACTUALLY MAYBE

757
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,897
WIN THIS ONE, SO IM JUST NOT
GOING TO EVERY GIVE UP.

758
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,167
WELK BACK HOME I
SELF-SACRIFICE ENDLESSLY TO

759
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,368
PLEASE PEOPLE.

760
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:13,804
I HAD TO REMIND MYSELF THAT IM
IN A GAME THAT ILL PROBABLY

761
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,509
ONLY GET ONE CHANCE TO PLAY, SO
WHEN IM IN THAT DLEM MARKEY

762
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,745
LOOK BACK AT THE TIME I WAS
TALKING TO JEFF FOR FIVE AND A

763
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:24,348
HALF HOURS AND HE WAS MY CAPTIVE
AUDIENCE, I CAN REMEMBER THAT

764
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:24,916
MEMORY.

765
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,850
Jeff: I WAS CAPTIVE.

766
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,019
YOU WERE CAPTIVE, YEAH, YOU
WERE CAPTIVE.

767
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:28,986
CAPTIVATED.

768
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,355
 Jeff: I COULDNT GO

769
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,323
ANYWHERE.

770
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,594
AND ALEC, YOU WERE TOE TO TOE
WITH CHRISTIAN.

771
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,995
CHRISTIAN TALKED THE ENTIRE
CHALLENGE.

772
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,463
YOU BARELY SAID A WORD.

773
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:42,066
WHEN DID IT START TO KICK IN
THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY HURTING.

774
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,036
I TOLD YOU ALL FROM THE
BEGINNING IM NOT STEPPING OFF

775
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,239
UNTIL I WIN BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
IM AT A REALLY VULNERABLE PLACE

776
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,040
IN THIS GAME.

777
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,942
THAT WAS MY MENTALITY GOING INTO
IT.

778
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,878
NEXT THING I KNOW, HOUR FIVE,
AND I REMEMBER JUST TRYING TO

779
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,814
FOCUS ON SOMETHING AND CLOSING
ONE EYE AND SHAKING MY HEAD.

780
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,083
AN I REMEMBER BEING REALLY
DIZZY.

781
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,886
Jeff: NICK, ONE OF THE
OTHER ELEMENTS WAS YOU HAD

782
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,256
CHANCE TO SIT OUT AND NOT
COMPETE FOR IMMUNITY AND HAVE

783
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,125
NACHOSSEN STEAD, WHICH YOU TOOK
PART IN ALONG WITH CARL AND

784
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:08,659
ANGELINA.

785
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,560
WAS THERE ANY IMPACT?

786
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,229
NO, THERE WASNT AT ALL.

787
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,698
IF ANYTHING THERE WAS OTHER
PEOPLE SAYING, MAN IF, I HAD

788
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,668
KNOWN THAT WAS SIX HOURS, I
WOULD HAVE SAT OUT AND HAD SOME

789
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:18,536
NACHOS TOO.

790
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,504
SO THE DECISION WE MADE LOOKED
BRILLIANT.

791
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,608
I THINK IT SAYS SOMEONES
ABOUT SOMEONES CHARACTER IF

792
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,042
THEYRE GOING TO OPT OUT.

793
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,712
JEFF, HES EATEN THREE
REWARDS.

794
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,981
I HAVENT EATING ANYTHING BUT A
SCOOP OF RICE HERE OR.

795
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,683
THERE THAT WAS THE ONLY
OPPORTUNITY I HAD TO GET SOME

796
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:36,420
FOOD, SO ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE MY
TIMING WAS RIGHT THAT I CHOSE TO

797
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,924
SIT OUT AND GIVE MYSELF SOME
NOURISHMENT, HAVE THE STRENGTH

798
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,893
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY TO
CONTINUE ON WITH MY ALLIANCE AND

799
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,594
ILL ROLL WITH IT.

800
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,096
IM CALLING A SPADE A SPADE.

801
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,231
YOU WERE CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO EAT
NACHOS.

802
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,666
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

803
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,102
IM SORRY, JEFF.

804
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,804
"SURVIVOR" IN EVERY WAY IS ABOUT
CALCULATED RISKS.

805
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,507
YOU KNOW, EAT A NACHO IS A
CALCULATED RISK.

806
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,909
TO NOT EAT THE NACHOS IS A
CALCULATED RISK.

807
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,345
ALSO WHAT THAT RISK REVEALS
ABOUT YOUR CALCULATION.

808
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,614
I THINK THATS WHAT WERE
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

809
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:07,518
YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF, THE
CONCEPT OF CALCULATED DECISIONS

810
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,553
IS REALLY SALIENT RIGHT NOW.

811
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,423
EVERYTHING IS DONE WITH
INTENTION, YOU KNOW, SHOULD I

812
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,493
GET THIS FOOD, AND AM I FEELING
IN A GOOD PLACE WITH THE PEOPLE

813
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,629
THAT SAY THAT THEY TRUST ME AND
WHO I SAY I TRUST?

814
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,898
THAT WAS SOMETHING PART OF MY
CALCULATION, AS WELL.

815
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:24,368
Jeff: ALISON, BUY THAT IN
 I DONT BUY A LOT OF WHAT

816
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,569
ANGELINA IS SELLING ANYMORE.

817
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,140
TO BE HONEST, JEFF, ITS
HYPOCRITICAL FOR ALSTON SAY THAT

818
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:32,376
WHEN THE THREE PEOPLE WHO WERE
CHIMING IN, THESE THREE GOLIATH,

819
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,647
THEY MADE A VERY CALCULATED
DECISION LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

820
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,848
Jeff: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

821
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,083
WHATS THE DECISION THEY MADE?

822
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,618
YES, ILL GET THERE.

823
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,720
Jeff: MIKE COVERING HIS
FACE.

824
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,556
NO, NO, NO, SO ITS OKAY,
MIKE.

825
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,924
IM GOING TO BE DELICATE ABOUT
IT.

826
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:50,161
BUT ID RATHER MUCH TALK ABOUT
HOW THE TRIBAL ALLIANCE HAS

827
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:53,364
FALLEN AND THERES NEW ALLIANCES
AND NEW RELATIONSHIPS THAN TALK

828
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,767
ABOUT A DECISION TO EAT NACHOS
BECAUSE I THINK THERES SO MUCH

829
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:57,935
MORE THAN THAT, JEFF.

830
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:01,238
Jeff: SO IS THIS MOMENT
THAT ANGELINA TALKING ABOUT THAT

831
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,341
GOES BACK TO LAST TRIBAL, IS IT
STILL RELEVANT RIGHT NOW?

832
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,377
I DEFINITELY THINK WEVE
CROSSED TRIBAL ALLIANCES NO

833
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,244
QUESTION THERE.

834
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,446
NEW ALLIANCES HAVE BEEN FORMED.

835
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,048
BUT I DONT THINK THEYVE TRULY
BEEN TESTED YET.

836
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,751
Jeff: AND THATS THE TRICK
IN "SURVIVOR" IS LIKE, ARE WE

837
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,787
GOING TO JUST TALK ABOUT IT OR
ARE WE GOING TO DO IT?

838
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:20,591
Jeff: ALISON, REALLY, THE
NUMBERS ARE SMALL ENOUGH NOW

839
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,060
THAT YOU BETTER BE PLAYING YOUR
OWN GAME.

840
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,261
RIGHT.

841
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,231
WE KEEP CIRCLING AROUND THESE
TRIBAL LINES ARE BLURRED, BUT

842
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,667
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE VOTES,
IT DOESNT SEEM LIKE THE

843
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,102
BLURRING IS HAPPENING.

844
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,271
ITS INTERESTING HOW EVERYONE
SORT OF KNOWS THE MOST LIKELY

845
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,708
PERSON GOING HOME TONIGHT IS THE
PERSON WHO IS ON THE BEAM FOR

846
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:38,909
FIVE AND A HALF HOURS.

847
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:39,510
Jeff: ALEC?

848
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,412
ALEC.

849
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,482
WE ALL KNOW ITS SOCIAL
POLITICS, ITS STRATEGY, ITS

850
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,750
NOT PHYSICAL.

851
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,618
CHRISTIAN STOOD ON THE BEACH AND
BEAT ME.

852
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:50,354
NUMBER TWO, MAYBE THESE PEOPLE
THROWING MY NAME ARE USING ME

853
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,922
BECAUSE IM AN EASY VOTE RIGHT.

854
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,191
NOW ONCE IM GONE, WHO ARE THE
EASY VOTES.

855
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,092
THE THREATS ARE GONE.

856
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,395
I BELIEVE IF IM A THREAT, KEEP
ME AROUND.

857
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,430
MAYBE IM A SHIELD FOR SOMEONE.

858
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,266
Jeff: ITS ALWAYS
INTERESTING WHAT ONE PERSON SEES

859
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,836
AS A REASON TO GET RID OF
SOMEONE IS WHAT ANOTHER PERSON

860
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,605
MIGHT SEE AS A REASON TO KEEP
SOMEBODY.

861
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:12,243
THATS FUNDAMENTAL TO HOW THE
GAME WORKS AND WHY THERES THIS

862
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,111
DICHOTOMY WHERE EVERY STRENGTH
CAN BECOME A WEAKNESS.

863
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,181
Jeff: CARL, THATS WHERE
ITS INTERESTING TO CIRCLE BACK

864
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,451
TO THE BEGINNING THAT YOU,
ANGELINA, AND NEW ENGLAND SAT

865
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:24,121
OUT OF THE CHALLENGE, BECAUSE IN
THESE LAST 24 HOURS, THE GAME

866
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,024
HAS SHIFTED, THAT COULD HAVE
BEEN A MILLION DOLLAR PLATTER OF

867
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,993
NACHOS YOU FEASTED ON.

00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:23,093
YOURE GOOD.

1046
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,728
START UNTYING.

1047
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,463
YOURE LOOKING FOR FIVE MARKED
BUOYS.

1048
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,197
THATS IT.

1049
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,532
CARL GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.

1050
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:29,933
CAN HE SCORE THAT FIRST POINT?

1051
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,500
NO.

1052
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,268
PURPLE IS GOOD.

1053
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,237
YOU CAN START SHOOTING.

1054
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,706
ITS GOING TO BE NICK.

1055
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,174
NICK SCORES FIRST SHOT.

1056
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,743
IT IS NOW PURPLE IN THE LEAD.

1057
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:43,380
HERE GOES DAVIE TRYING TO TIE IT
UP.

1058
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,848
DAVIE, WHOA.

1059
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:48,752
DAVIE SCORES FOR ORANGE WITH
AUTHORITY.

1060
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,187
HERE GOES ALISON.

1061
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:55,625
NO, HERE GOES CARL FOR ORANGE.

1062
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,259
HES BEEN CLOSE.

1063
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,594
THIS TIME HE GETS IT DONE.

1064
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:58,795
ORANGE BACK IN THE LEAD NOW.

1065
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,064
HERE GOES NICK, NOT MESSING
AROUND.

1066
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:01,932
NICK SCORES.

1067
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,000
WERE TIED AGAIN.

1068
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:03,767
2-2.

1069
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,771
IT IS BECOME -- BACK AND FORTH.

1070
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:08,772
HERE GOES DAVIE.

1071
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,974
IT IS NOW ORANGE IN THE LEAD,
3-2.

1072
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,410
YOU HAVE FIVE BUOYS TOTAL.

1073
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,212
ANGELINA JUST MISSES.

1074
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,247
CARL COULD EXTEND THE LEAD RIGHT
HERE.

1075
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,249
AND HE DOES.

1076
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:19,983
ORANGE HAS FOUR.

1077
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,020
THEY ARE DOWN TO THEIR LAST ONE.

1078
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:27,758
IT WOULD BE CARLS FIRST REWARD
EARNED IN THIS GAME, AND HES A

1079
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,226
PART OF HELPING THEM WIN IT.

1080
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:36,533
HERE GOES DAVIE FOR THE WIN
RIGHT HERE.

1081
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,667
AND HES GOT IT.

1082
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,470
ORANGE WINS REWARD.

1083
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:46,043
DAVIE, MIKE, KARA, AND CARL
WITHIN REWARD.

1084
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:51,715
THE DROUGHT IS OVER FOR CARL,
AND IT CONTINUES FOR ANGELINA.

1085
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:57,320
STILL HAS NOT WON A REWARD IN
THIS GAME.

1086
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:00,957
MIKE, KARA, CARL, DAVIE, FUN
AFTERNOON.

1087
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,528
FRIED CHICKEN, COLD BEVERAGES,
INCLUDING BEER.

1088
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:11,701
BRING IN THE BOAT.

1089
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,769
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

1090
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:13,603
HEAD OUT.

1091
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,338
ENJOY YOUR AFTERNOON.

1092
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:16,573
ALL RIGHT.

1093
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:20,010
NICK, ALISON, GABBY, ANGELINA,
CHRISTIAN, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

1094
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:24,281
HAVE A FUN AFTERNOON BACK AT
CAMP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF RICE.

1095
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,417
WINNING THIS REWARD WAS SO
CRUCIAL BECAUSE I REALLY DO

1096
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:31,088
THINK THAT THE DAVIDS VERY WELL
COULD FROM HERE ON OUT JUST PICK

1097
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,623
OFF THE GOLIATHS ONE BY ONE.

1098
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,259
SO ITS A GREAT TIME TO
RECONNECT WITH CARL AND DAVIE,

1099
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:40,263
WHO I CAME BACK FROM VUKU FROM,
AND IF WE COULD GET EVEN CLOSER,

1100
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:44,301
NO MATTER WHAT, IT WOULD TAKE ME
FURTHER IN THE GAME

1101
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:55,345
PUT THIS BOAT IN GEAR AND
LETS GET IT.

1102
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:56,646
LETS GO, BABY.

1103
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,783
WINNERS!

1104
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:00,917
I LOVE IT.

1105
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,918
I LOVE IT.

1106
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:07,491
I LOVE EVERY BIT OF IT.

1107
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,494
THE BEERS ON THE BOAT GO
ROUND AND ROUND, ROUND AND

1108
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,963
ROUND.

1109
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:13,930
CARL, YOU NEED A BEER?

1110
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:20,437
[BURPING]
 DAMN.

1111
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,341
WINNING REWARD WITH CARL,
DAVIE, AND KARA WAS A TRIUMPH,

1112
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,843
BECAUSE CARL AND DAVIE ARE KIND
OF IN POWER NOW.

1113
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:30,180
IM TRULY A FREE AGENT, AND I
FEEL LIKE I CAN USE THEM TO MY

1114
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:34,117
ADVANTAGE, SO IT WAS A GOOD TIME
TO KIND OF SUCK UP TO THE KING,

1115
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,653
AND KARA AND I DID A LOT OF
SUCKING UP.

1116
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:38,522
THIS IS MY FIRST REWARD, MAN.

1117
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,157
I KNEW THAT YOU NEED IT.

1118
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,159
I COULD LITERALLY CRY RIGHT
NOW AT THIS MOMENT.

1119
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,326
THIS IS CARLS FIRST REWARD.

1120
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,594
HES STOKED.

1121
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:48,165
ITS APPARENT THAT HE LOVES BEER
AND HES JUST NOT WORRIED ABOUT

1122
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,399
A THING.

1123
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:50,467
SO WE GOOD.

1124
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,268
WE GOOD, MAN.

1125
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:52,869
I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME.

1126
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,839
ALISON HAS TO GO NEXT.

1127
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,675
THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS GOING TO
BE HURT BY THAT IS GABBY.

1128
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,976
NO ONE ELSE.

1129
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,612
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS, SO NOT A
PROBLEM.

1130
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:06,283
I DONT KNOW IF IT WAS A SLIP
UP, BUT HES COMFORTABLE WITH ME

1131
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:10,453
AND HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO GET
ALISON OUT, WHICH IS

1132
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,190
UNBELIEVABLE THAT YOU REALLY
THINK THAT IM GOING TO BE FINE

1133
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:16,826
WITH YET ANOTHER GOLIATH, YET
ANOTHER PERSON ON MY ALLIANCE TO

1134
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,994
GO HOME.

1135
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,363
IM JUST GOING TO PRETEND LIKE
WERE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER

1136
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:30,607
MOVING FORWARD AND IM VERY GLAD
THAT I HAVE MIKE HERE WITH ME.

1137
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,276
DAVIES DRUNK.

1138
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,044
ADVANTAGE QUICKSAND.

1139
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:38,048
CARL WITH HIS BEER IN HIS
HAND.

1140
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,082
I SEE FOOD.

1141
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:43,220
WE GOT BISCUITS, POTATO
SALAD.

1142
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,221
OH, MY GOD.

1143
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,723
THATS ICED TEA WITH LEMONS
IN IT.

1144
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,425
AND PLATES AND ACTUAL FORKS.

1145
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,693
THANK YOU, GOD.

1146
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,529
THIS IS THE BEST REWARD, NOT
ONLY GETTING TO EAT, BUT BECAUSE

1147
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:57,400
I WAS ABLE TO PROVE TO MYSELF
THAT I AM AN ATHLETE, MAN.

1148
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:02,672
I CONTINUOUSLY BY MY HOMEBOYS
GET MY BLACK CARD TAKEN AWAY

1149
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:03,440
FROM ME.

1150
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,175
YOU ALL KNOW WHAT A BLACK CARD
IS?

1151
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,477
THATS WHEN THEY TRY TO TELL YOU
YOURE NOT BLACK.

1152
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,812
YOUVE GOT TO BE ABLE TO PLAY
SPORTS.

1153
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,415
YOU GOT TO WATCH SPORTS, AND I
NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO NONE OF

1154
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:17,187
THAT, AT LEAST IN MY MIND, BUT
RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW...

1155
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,288
YOU NAILED IT.

1156
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,191
YOURE SHAQUILLE ONEAL.

1157
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,592
FINGER ROLL.

1158
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,561
THEYRE NOT TAKING MY BLACK
CARD NO MORE.

1159
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,098
THE FACT THAT I WAS ABLE TO DUNK
ON FIRST ONE, IT WAS LIKE, COME

1160
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,934
ON, MAN, YOU GOT THIS STUFF IN
YOU, DUDE.

1161
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,970
IT WONT BE A PIECE OF
CHICKEN LEFT ON THAT PLATE.

1162
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,071
I CAN PROMISE YOU.

1163
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:35,939
IM HAPPY.

1164
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,508
IM SO HAPPY THAT ITS US
FOUR.

1165
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:42,245
BECAUSE THERES SOME PEOPLE AT
THAT BEACH THAT ARE SHADY,

1166
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,581
SHADY, SHADY.

1167
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:48,118
JUST KNOW IF YOU NEED TO GET
ALISON OUT OR SOMETHING, WERE

1168
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:48,652
HERE TO HELP.

1169
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:49,653
WERE HERE TO HELP.

1170
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,488
EXACTLY.

1171
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:52,856
ITS JUST MATTER OF TIME.

1172
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,324
WERE DOING IT.

1173
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:55,225
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

1174
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,459
LOVE YOU, TOO.

1175
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,162
CARLS ERROR IN THIS GAME AT
THIS POINT IS THIS CONFIDENCE

1176
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,798
THAT HE CAN SAY WHOEVER HE WANTS
TO AND THAT EVERYONE WILL GO

1177
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,366
ALONG WITH IT.

1178
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,870
ITS REALLY SOLIDIFIED THE FACT
THAT IM JUST A PAWN IN CARLS

1179
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:12,475
GRAND SCHEME, AND I DIDNT COME
HERE TO PLAY A PAWN.

1180
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:15,679
HE IS JUST GETTING DRUNK ON THIS
REWARD.

1181
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,914
HES LIKE DRUNK OFF POWER IN
THIS GAME.

1182
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:22,552
HIS CONFIDENCE IS BLOWING OUT OF
HIS BEER BOTTLE.

1183
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,422
AND IT WAS GREAT FOR MY GAME,
BECAUSE NOW I KNOW WHERE HIS

1184
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:33,163
HEAD IS AT.

1185
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,632
YOU REALLY THINK ITS FIVE?

1186
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,267
I REALLY DONT KNOW, GABBY.

1187
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,935
IM NOT SOLD ON THE FIVE.

1188
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:40,970
I THINK IT WOULD BE FOOLISH.

1189
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,039
CARL IS PERCEIVED AS CALLING ALL
THE SHOTS.

1190
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:50,146
SO THERE -- THEYRE GOING TO
PERCEIVE IT THAT WE WENT ALONG

1191
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,381
AS THE GODFATHER.

1192
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:54,184
AS LONG AS HE IS PERCEIVED AS
CALLING ALL THE SHOTS, WE WONT

1193
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,418
GET CREDIT.

1194
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,687
WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE GOD FARE
SO PEOPLE KNOW WE HAVE AGENCY IN

1195
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,688
THIS GAME.

1196
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:02,692
I THINK ITS TIME TO MAKE A
MOVE, AND IM READY.

1197
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:08,164
MY JOB AS A TECHNICAL WRITER IS
TO LOOK AT A WHOLE BUNCH OF

1198
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,734
INFORMATION, SYNTHESIZE IT AND
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY

1199
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:11,634
NEEDED.

1200
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,002
AND THATS WHAT IVE BEEN DOING
WITH CARL.

1201
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,606
IVE BEEN GEARING INFORMATION,
HOW HE TREATS ME, HOW HE TREATS

1202
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,342
OTHERS, HOW HE ACTS IN THE
ALLIANCE, AND IM NOT GOING TO

1203
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,710
JUST SIT ON THAT INFORMATION.

1204
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,580
IM GOING TO ACT ON IT.

1205
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:27,951
THIS IS WHAT IM HOPING HAPPENS
IN FULL CANDOR, BECAUSE HONESTLY

1206
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,453
AT THIS POINT I SEE YOU AND
CHRISTIAN AS MY CLOSEST ALLY.

1207
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:35,525
I WANT IT TO BE A BLINDSIDE OR
CARL, BECAUSE IM TELLING YOU,

1208
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:39,229
CARL, NICK, AND DAVIE THINK ITS
DAVID STRONG.

1209
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:44,367
SO I HOPE THAT ME AND CHRISTIAN
CAN WALK IT DOWN, GET MIKE AND

1210
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,036
WE FREAKIN DO IT, BECAUSE NOT
ONE EXTRA PERSON CAN KNOW.

1211
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:51,174
IT IS MUSIC TO MY EARS THAT
GABBY WANTS TO VOTE TOGETHER AND

1212
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,076
TAKE OUT A THREAT IN THIS GAME.

1213
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:56,679
WEVE BEEN DOING THIS SONG AND
DANCE FOR FIVE TRIBAL COUNCILS

1214
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:57,881
NOW, BUT THE TIMING FEELS RIGHT.

1215
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,783
THE CLOUDS ARE PARTING.

1216
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,551
THE SUN IS SHINING.

1217
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,886
THERE IS AN HALLELUJAH CHORUS.

1218
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,189
WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS.

1219
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,024
HEY THERE.

1220
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:08,958
WELCOME BACK.

1221
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:13,196
WAS IT GOOD?

1222
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,732
THE REWARD WAS AWESOME.

1223
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,934
I MEAN, I ENJOYED EVERY BIT OF
IT.

1224
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:22,205
AND I FEEL AS THOUGH MY GAME IS
IN GREAT SHAPE.

1225
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,573
AND I HAD BEER.

1226
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,774
CHICKEN AND BEER.

1227
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,310
WE FOUGHT HARD TO GET THE
NUMBERS, WE DONT PLAN ON GIVING

1228
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:28,578
IT BACK.

1229
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,780
WE CAN PICK THEM APART ONE AT A
TIME LIKE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO

1230
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:37,187
DO TO US.

1231
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,323
SO WE DONT HAVE TO DO A WHOLE
LOT OF SCRAMBLING.

1232
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:43,359
IM READY TO GET ALISON ASS OUT
OF HERE.

1233
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,530
SHES THE BIGGEST THREAT THATS
LEFT.

1234
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,332
ALISON.

1235
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:52,569
WERE NOT GOING TO WALK AROUND
HERE SCRAMBLING.

1236
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:55,205
THAT WERE NOT GOING TO DO.

1237
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:59,175
THE ONLY BACKLASH WERE GOING TO
GET FROM THAT --

1238
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:04,581
CHRISTIAN SEEMS REALLY SOLID.

1239
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:07,350
US FOUR AND CHRISTIAN FIVE,
THATS ROCK SOLID.

1240
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:11,421
I THINK ITS GOING TO BE
GABY.

1241
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,655
ITS GOING TO BE YOU.

1242
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,625
ESSENTIALLY I HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO REPLACE GAB YESS POSITION

1243
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:19,229
WITHIN THE HISTORIC DAVIDS AND
PUT GABBY ON THE OUTS.

1244
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,966
GABBY HAS BECOME SO CLOSE WITH
ALISON, AND SHES GOING TO GO

1245
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,201
RIGHT DOWN WITH HER.

1246
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:30,540
LISTEN, TOMORROW THE VOTE IS
GOING TO BE FOR ALISON.

1247
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:31,608
ALISON IS THE BIGGEST THREAT.

1248
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:32,308
I KNOW.

1249
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,677
TO ME CARL IS THE GODFATHER.

1250
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:39,616
HE BRINGS ME OVER, AND HES
LIKE, WERE VOTING ALISON, AND

1251
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,585
THEN WERE SUPPOSED TO KISSs
THE RING AND HEAD OFF TO THE

1252
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:43,586
BEACH.

1253
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,722
BUT FOR NOW, IM KIND OF OKAY
WITH THAT.

1254
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,625
I THINK THE DAVIDS HAVE THEIR
PECKING ORDER, AND ALISON IS

1255
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:52,328
NEXT UP, SO I HAVE TO GET ON MY
LIFEBOAT AND LIKE SWIM AWAY FROM

1256
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,396
THE ALISON SHIP.

1257
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:59,569
WE DONT WANT TO BE
SCRAMBLING, SO, WE ALL DECIDED

1258
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,403
ITS GOING TO BE ALISON.

1259
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:01,304
ALISON?

1260
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,540
YEAH.

1261
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:07,443
IF GABBY ASKS YOU, WERE VOTING
FOR ANGELINA.

1262
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:11,814
THE PLAN HANDED DOWN BY
GODFATHER CARL, WHEN I WAS

1263
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:15,585
BECKONED TO HIS BEDSIDE, HE
TELLS ME, CHRISTIAN, THE VOTE IS

1264
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:16,252
ALISON.

1265
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,987
WERE LEAVING GABBY OUT OF IT.

1266
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:21,190
IT WILL PISS OFF GABBY, BUT
WHAT YOU GOING TO DO?

1267
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,659
COOL WITH THAT?

1268
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,861
CARL, IM COOL WITH IT.

1269
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,029
ABSOLUTELY.

1270
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,365
I ALWAYS LOVE TO DEFER ALL MY
MAJOR STRATEGIC DECISIONS TO

1271
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,668
SOMEONE WHO IS STILL HALF
SLOSHED.

1272
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:34,804
WE DONT HAVE TO DO NO
SCRAMBLING TOMORROW YOU GUYS.

1273
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:35,638
ITS THAT SIMPLE.

1274
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,640
GABBY IS MY CLOSEST ALLY.

1275
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,376
ILL MAKE SURE SHE THINKS
ITS ANGELINA.

1276
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,477
THERE YOU GO.

1277
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,712
THATS ALL WE NEED TO DO.

1278
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:47,317
SO THAT MOMENT WAS A FINAL
DATA POINT FOR ME THAT CARL MUST

1279
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:55,458
GO.

1280
00:59:55,491 --> 01:00:01,764
LETS SAY CARL MAGICALLY WENT
AWAY.

1281
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,633
HE HAS POWER IN A MORE LITERAL
SENSE THAN IVE EVER SEEN.

1282
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,669
THERES SOMETHING SLIGHTLY
MENACING ABOUT IT.

1283
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:20,483
I WOULD BE WORKING WITH
ALISON, KARA, GABBY, AND ME.

1284
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,484
THATS FIVE.

1285
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:24,354
CHRISTIAN AND GABBY ARE READY
TO FLIP.

1286
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:27,457
CHRISTIAN AND GABBY ALONG WITH
KARA AND ALISON ARE READY TO

1287
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,159
VOTE FOR CARL, AND THEY NEED A
FIFTH AND THEY NEED ME.

1288
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:33,463
TO BE HONEST, IM WILLING TO
SWING LEFT OR RIGHT, YOU KNOW

1289
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:34,564
WHAT I MEAN?

1290
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,100
THATS WONDERFUL TO HEAR,
MIKE.

1291
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,968
I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE IM IN
THE MIDDLE RIGHT NOW.

1292
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:42,472
THERES FOR ON ONE SIDE, FOUR ON
THE OTHER, BUT ITS A WIN-WIN.

1293
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:46,242
LIKE IF CARL GOES HOME, THEN,
YOU KNOW, THE GODFATHER IS GONE.

1294
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,978
AND IF ALISON GOES HOME, THEN
WONDER WOMAN IS GONE AND I CAN

1295
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:52,015
MAKE THE DECISION WHICH WILL
SERVE MY GAME THE BEST.

1296
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:07,530
THERE IS THE SUN.

1297
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,332
OH, THERE IT IS.

1298
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:09,966
AWESOME.

1299
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,068
THATS A BEAUTIFUL SIGN.

1300
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,069
YEAH.

1301
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:17,874
GABBY AND CHRISTIAN ARE OUT
THERE WATCHING IT.

1302
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:26,949
SO RIGHT NOW IM TELLING YOU,
THE REAL PLAN, WEVE DECIDED TO

1303
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:28,217
VOTE ANGELINA.

1304
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,820
SO THEYRE REALLY LYING TO ME
AND NOT TELLING ME ITS ALISON.

1305
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,523
I CANT WAIT FOR TONIGHT.

1306
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:36,592
BECAUSE THAT PROVES THAT IM
NOT WITH THEM.

1307
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:39,362
AND THEYRE USING ANGELINA
INSTEAD OF ME.

1308
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:40,063
THATS GOOD.

1309
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,798
IM SO GLAD IM MAKING A MOVE.

1310
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:42,965
IM NOT STUPID.

1311
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:46,169
THE REAL TARGET IS ALISON, AND
THE REASON THE DAVIDS ARENT

1312
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:50,540
TELLING ME IS BECAUSE THEY THINK
THAT IM CLOSE TO ALISON.

1313
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:51,808
THATS SO FUNNY.

1314
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,576
DO PEOPLE SERIOUSLY THINK IM
STUPID.

1315
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:57,447
I DONT KNOW HOW YOU CAN SAY
YOURE IN AN ALLIANCE AND NOT

1316
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,184
TELL ONE OF YOUR ALLIANCE
MEMBERS WHO YOURE VOTING FOR.

1317
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:07,256
WERE NOT IN AN ALLIANCE, ARE
WE?

1318
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,425
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

1319
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,595
IM ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU.

1320
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,097
WE SHOULD COUNT OUT HOW MUCH IS
LEFT.

1321
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,231
I KNOW ITS LOW.

1322
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,266
I KNOW WEVE ALREADY HAD WAY TOO
MUCH.

1323
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,569
WERE IN A BAD SPOT RIGHT NOW.

1324
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:23,005
THE RICE HAS JUST QUICKLY
BEEN DEPLETING.

1325
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,508
BASICALLY AT THIS RATE, WE WILL
BE OUT OF RICE WITHIN ONE OR TWO

1326
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,776
DAYS.

1327
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:31,147
CURRENT SITUATION IS THAT WE
HAVE 15 OF THE SMALL SEASHELLS.

1328
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,916
SO WERE LESS THAN ONE-THIRD OF
WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO JUST

1329
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,152
SUSTAIN WHAT WEVE BEEN EATING
SO FAR.

1330
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:41,157
AND I IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED
THIS OPPORTUNITY AS MY CHANCE TO

1331
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:45,795
START A NEGOTIATION WITH JEFF AT
THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1332
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:49,966
SO MY IDEA IS WE START WITH
FIRST OFF ALL OF THE FISHING

1333
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:50,933
GEAR.

1334
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,836
SECOND WOULD BE MAJORITY OF THE
COOKING GEAR.

1335
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,506
DURING MY COURSE OF STUDY WHEN I
WAS GETTING MY MBA AT YALE,

1336
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,609
THERE IS A REQUIRED NEGOTIATIONS
CLASS, AND I LOVED IT SO MUCH

1337
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:02,812
THAT I ACTUALLY ELECTED TO TAKE
ADVANCED NEGOTIATIONS.

1338
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,581
SO ITS AN AREA THAT I JUST LOVE
TO DO.

1339
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,616
ITS FUN TO ME.

1340
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,084
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE
HAMMOCKS.

1341
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,820
YOU WANT TO START WITH ALL
THAT STUFF?

1342
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:15,258
ANGELINA IS LIKE SHE KNOWS
EXACTLY HOW MUCH RICE WERE

1343
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,728
SUPPOSED TO EAT EVERY DAY FOR
THE REST OF THE THING, AND SHES

1344
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:21,164
LIKE DONE AN INVENTORY OF
EVERYTHING AT THE CAMP, THE

1345
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:26,969
FISHING GEAR, THE LUXURIES, THE
BLANKETS, AND SHES READY TO

1346
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:28,237
SELL IT DOWN TO GET SOME RICE.

1347
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:31,541
IN A WAY, SHES RIGHT, BUT SHES
STILL AGGRAVATING EVERY STEP OF

1348
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:37,446
THE WAY.

1349
01:03:49,392 --> 01:04:00,803
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1350
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:01,671
ALL RIGHT.

1351
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,806
LETS GET TO TODAYS IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

1352
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:09,512
FIRST THINGS FIRST, CHRISTIAN,
GOT TO TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.

1353
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:12,615
TURN AROUND, PLEASE.

1354
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,117
HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

1355
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,452
YOURE NOT BEING ARRESTED AT
THIS POINT.

1356
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:19,021
WELL SAVE THAT FOR LATER.

1357
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,191
Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY
IS BECOME UP FOR GRABS.

1358
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:30,466
FOR TODAYS CHALLENGE, YOURE
GOING TO RACE OVER AN OBSTACLE.

1359
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,669
THEN AROUND A POST, AND THEN
CROSS A BALANCE BEAM, CHECKING

1360
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:37,006
THREE BUNDLES OF PUZZLE PIECES
ALONG THE WAY.

1361
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,544
YOULL THEN USE THOSE PIECES TO
SOLVE A WORD PUZZLE.

1362
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:47,416
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE AT THE VOTE, GUARANTEED A

1363
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,752
1-8 SHOT AT GETTING TO THE END.

1364
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:52,822
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH

1365
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:54,790
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1366
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:55,424
BIG STAKES.

1367
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,059
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO IT?

1368
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:57,560
YEAH.

1369
01:04:57,593 --> 01:04:59,028
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1370
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,931
WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU
BEFORE WE GET TO THE IMMUNITY

1371
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:02,665
CHALLENGE.

1372
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,467
Jeff: YEAH, GO.

1373
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,170
SO THE TRIBE WAS WONDERING IF
YOU WERE OPEN TO A NEGOTIATION

1374
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:08,671
REGARDING RICE.

1375
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:09,438
Jeff: WHATS UP?

1376
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:12,041
SO WERE GETTING CRITICALLY
LOW.

1377
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:17,546
WERE AT THE POINT NOW WHERE WE
HAVE AT BEST TEN OF THESE SHELLS

1378
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,349
REMAINING, AND SO WERE PREPARED
TO MAKE AN OFFER TO YOU UNLESS

1379
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,518
YOU WANT TO PUT THE FIRST OFFER
OUT.

1380
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:23,886
NO, GO AHEAD.

OKAY.

1382
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,423
Jeff: THIS IS FUN.

1383
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:30,826
SO OUR STARTING OFFER, AND
THIS WAS DISCUSSED AS WHOLE, IS

SOMEONE IN MY ALLIANCE WINS THE
IMMUNITY.

1527
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,464
ALISON IS WITHOUT THE NECKLACE.

1528
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:46,168
SO IM LEAVING FEELING LIKE I
WON, BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO CLOSE

1529
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:50,205

01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:26,542
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

1537
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:30,012

TO DO IS MAKE A DUMB MOVE AND
GIVE THE GOLIATHS THE NUMBERS

1546
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:54,770

01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:15,791
BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THEYRE
WRITING MY NAME.

1555
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:18,127
I THINK IT WILL BE BECAUSE
YOU DIDNT WIN IMMUNITY.

1556
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,663
THE MARGINS HEADING INTO
TONIGHTS TRIBAL COUNCIL ARE

1557
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:22,398
RAZOR THIN.

1558
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,933
ITS GOING TO BE A 5-4 VOTE.

1559
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:31,173
MOST LIKELY, AND THE FATE OF MY
GAME RESTS IN THE HANDS OF KARA,

1560
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:33,308
CHRISTIAN,, GABBY, AND MIKE.

1561
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:38,447
SO I OBVIOUSLY HAVE THAT FEAR
TODAY THAT ANY OF THE PEOPLE

1562
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:46,188
THAT I THINK ARE WRITING DOWN MY
NAME AND IM GOING TO BE THE

1563
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,156
FIFTH MEMBER OF THE JURY.

1564
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,158
OUR NEXT CONVERSATION NEEDS
TO BE WITH MIKE.

1565
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:52,861
YEAH.

1566
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:56,932
RIGHT NOW THERES TWO CAMPS,
AND IM IN THE MIDDLE.

1567
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,768
IVE MADE REALLY STRONG
ASSURANCES TO BOTH GROUPS THAT

1568
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:00,636
IM WITH THEM.

1569
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:01,904
AWESOME.

1570
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,071
YEAH.

1571
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,875
IM A WRITER AND DIRECTOR,
BUT IM ALSO AN ACTOR, AND I

1572
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:11,246
HAVE TO DO LIKE MY GREATEST
ACTING IVE EVER DONE TO JUST

1573
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,414
GET THROUGH THIS DAY.

1574
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,417
I KNOW WE HAVE FOUR VOTES.

1575
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,318
SO WHAT?

1576
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:17,719
ANY ONE THING GOES WRONG.

1577
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:22,124
WELL, IM DEFINITELY -- EVERY
PERSON IVE TALKED TO IS ALL IN.

1578
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:24,893
AT THIS POINT ITS EVERY
GOLIATH FOR HIMSELF.

1579
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,729
AND EVEN THOUGH ALISON AN I
WORKED TOGETHER FROM THE

1580
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,032
BEGINNING, ALISON IS THE MOST
COMPETITIVE PERSON OUT HERE, SO

1581
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:34,102
IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE EASIER FOR
MY GAME IF ALISON GOES HOME.

1582
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,706
AND I THINK CARL, HES KIND OF
BECOME THE DON MAFIA OF THE

1583
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:39,107
CAMP, AND ITS ANNOYING.

1584
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,611
SO ITS GOING TO BE A HARD CALL
TONIGHT, BECAUSE IM GOING TO BE

1585
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:46,882
BURNING SOME BRIDGES ONE WAY OR
ANOTHER.

1586
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:49,451
IM FULL OF DIRT.

1587
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:52,454
I KEEP PULLING OUT SAND.

1588
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,090
UH, THIS IS THE THING I HATE THE
MOST BEING OUT HERE.

1589
01:14:55,123 --> 01:15:00,095
I HAVE NO PARANOIA, I JUST HAVE
BEARD HATE.

1590
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:01,129
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

1591
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,665
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

1592
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:07,836
I LOVE MIKE, AND I THINK MIKE
WANTS TO TAKE OUT CARL.

1593
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,338
BUT MIKE IS A PROFESSIONAL
ACTOR.

1594
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,039
HE WORKS IN HOLLYWOOD.

1595
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,374
I MEAN, THIS IS HIS JOB.

1596
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:14,610
HE VOTED FOR ME TWICE.

1597
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:17,312
WERE BOTH STILL COOL WITH
TODAY?

1598
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,649
OH, YEAH, IM 100% IN.

1599
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:25,254
AN YET IM TRUSTING HIM ON
THIS VOTE TO VOTE WITH ME.

1600
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,990
BUT I HAVE TO TAKE THE SHOT.

1601
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:31,159
I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH BASE
ONE LAST TIME.

1602
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,694
CARL?

1603
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,096
SOLID.

1604
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:37,232
WERE ALL SET, AS LONG AS MIKE
DOESNT [BLEEPED] US.

1605
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,167
I THINK HE ALMOST IM STOKED.

1606
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,736
OKAY.

1607
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:43,805
WELL PICK UP THE PIECES WHEN
WE GET HOME.

1608
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:47,476
THEYLL BE APOLOGIZING TO US,
OR THE ME.

1609
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,177
AT LEAST TO YOU, THATS TRUE.

1610
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:54,116
IF CARL GOES HOME TONIGHT,
IM GOING TO FEEL SO VINDICATED

1611
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:58,487
THAT THIS WHOLE TIME IVE BEEN
SEEN AS AN EMOTIONAL YOUNG

1612
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:03,425
WOMAN, SEEN AS HYSTERICAL, ALL
THESE INSULTS SLUNG MY WAY, AND

1613
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:08,897
IM GOING TO FEEL SO PROUD THAT
I BROKE FREE FROM THOSE

1614
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:12,401
PERCEPTIONS AND SHOWED THAT IM
NOT GOING TO BE AN UNDERDOG IN

1615
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:15,103
THIS GAME ANYMORE.

1616
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:18,473
BUT THE PLAN REALLY HAS TO BE
EXECUTED FLAWLESSLY, OTHERWISE

1617
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:22,511
IM WRITING DOWN CARLS NAME AND
HES COMING BACK TO CAMP WITH ME

1618
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:24,546
AND ALL WILL BE EXPOSED.

1619
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:55,077
Jeff: WELL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1620
01:16:55,110 --> 01:17:01,083
ELIZABETH, JOHN, DAN, AND ALEC,
VOTESSED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL

1621
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:06,755
COUNCIL.

1622
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,925
SO KARA, LAST FRIDAY EVERYBODY
VOTED FOR ALEC.

1623
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,628
WAS THERE A SHIFT IN THE
DYNAMIC, OR DO YOU THINK IT WILL

1624
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,364
BE THE SAME THING AGAIN,
EVERYBODYS GOING TO VOTE FOR

1625
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:15,964
ONE PERSON?

1626
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:17,132
LAST TRIBAL WAS TOUGH.

1627
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:22,704
IT WAS BASICALLY LIKE A
SACRIFICE TO SHOW THAT WE WANTED

1628
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:26,508
TO WORK WITH THE DAVIDS, AND
TONIGHT IF I CAN RELATE IT TO

1629
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:29,745
REAL ESTATE, YOU SAY YOU WANT TO
WORK WITH SOMEBODY,

1630
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:33,448
IS OFFICIAL UNTIL YOU SIGN THAT
CONTRACT THAT PROVES WHERE THE

1631
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,751
LINE REALLY ARE DRAWN.

1632
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:39,421
Jeff: ALISON, IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE LAST VOTE WAS A SHOW OF

1633
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:40,589
GOOD FAITH.

1634
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:42,524
CERTAINLY DEMONSTRATING THAT
I WAS WILLING TO VOTE OUT

1635
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:43,959
SOMEONE WHO WAS SO CLOSE TO ME.

1636
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,228
I WAS SAYING, IM HERE TO PLAY
THIS GAME.

1637
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,330
LET ME PLAY WITH YOU.

1638
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:51,867
Jeff: SO NICK, WHAT IS THE
DYNAMIC AT CAMP NOW?

1639
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:55,704
WELL, I THINK WHEN THERE WERE
SEVEN GOLIATHS AND FIVE DAVIDS

1640
01:17:55,737 --> 01:18:00,442
THE BEACH WAS LIKE A FRYING PAN
AND THERE WAS SCRAMBLED EGGS

1641
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,645
EVERYWHERE, BECAUSE EVERYBODY
WAS SCRAMBLING, AND NOW ITS A

1642
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,413
LOT LESS HECTIC.

1643
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:05,514
PERHAPS MORE OF A POACHED
EGG.

1644
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:10,185
YOU TAKE A BIG BOILER BOWL AND
DROP THE EGG IN.

1645
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:13,588
THERES LITTLE PIECES SWIRLING
AROUND, BUT EVENTUALLY THEY

1646
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:17,259
COALESCE INTO ONE WHOLE, WHICH
IS PRESUMABLY THE PLAN YOU THINK

1647
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:18,860
IS GOING TO GO DOWN AT TRIBAL
TONIGHT.

1648
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:20,896
THATS AWESOME.

1649
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:21,730
THAT MAKES SENSE.

1650
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:23,999
AND ILL ADD JUST ONE THING,
JEFF.

1651
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:27,002
THIS THERE IS A REALLY JOVIAL
SPIRIT AT CAMP, BUT TRIBAL IS

1652
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,503
LIKE A COLISEUM.

1653
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:33,308
WERE ALL GLADIATORS, BUT WERE
GIVING EACH OTHER PERMISSION TO

1654
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,944
PLAY THIS GAME HARD AND NOT TAKE
THINGS TOO PERSONALLY.

1655
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:36,745
Jeff: MIKE, YOURE NODDING?

1656
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,114
I THINK THAT ANALOGY IS GOOD.

1657
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:42,551
WHEN I FIRST STARTED VOTING
PEOPLE OUT, I FELT GUILT

1658
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:43,719
STRICKEN.

1659
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:46,354
AS THERES MORE BLOOD ON THE
FLOOR, OKAY, LETS GET ANOTHER

1660
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:49,057
PERSON OUT OF CAMP.

1661
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:51,460
I DONT KNOW, ITS THE ONLY WAY
I CAN SAY IT.

1662
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:54,496
Jeff: ALISON, WHAT DID YOU
NOTICE AT CAMP TODAY?

1663
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:55,597
WAS IT CALM?

1664
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,566
OR WAS THERE A LEVEL OF TENSION?

1665
01:18:57,599 --> 01:19:02,471
IT WAS SURPRISINGLY CALM TO
THE POINT THAT IT WAS

1666
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:03,739
DISCOMFORTING TO ME.

1667
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:08,844
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT LAST TRIBAL
WOULD LIBERATE MY GAME, AND THEN

1668
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,812
MAYBE IM JUST THE NEXT ONE.

1669
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:14,916
I THINK WHATS HAPPENING WITH
ALISON IS SHES HAD SCRAMBLED

1670
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,618
EGGS FOR SO LONG, AN NOW ITS
SWITCHED UP AND HER BREAKFAST

1671
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:17,619
TASTES DIFFERENT.

1672
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:18,587
IT HAS HER WORRIED.

1673
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,555
ITS A DIFFERENT TASTE IN HER
MOUTH.

1674
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:21,490
ITS JUST DIFFERENCE.

1675
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,659
Jeff: CARL, DID YOU FEEL
THAT SAME THING?

1676
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:25,861
PEOPLE WERENT TALKING TO YOU?

1677
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:30,065
FOR ME HONESTLY, CAMP DIDNT
SEEM ANY DIFFERENT.

1678
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,335
I KNEW WHO I HAD SPOKE WITHIN
PREVIOUSLY, IF THEY WANT TO TALK

1679
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:36,004
TO ME, ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS
COME TO THE SHELTER.

1680
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:39,207
SO IM OKAY WITH THE WAY THE
VIBE WAS AT CAMP TODAY.

1681
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:42,511
Jeff: GABBY, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF CARLS ANSWER?

1682
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:46,581
WHAT I HEAR HIM SAY, IF ANYBODY
FELT VULNERABLE, THEY KNOW WHERE

1683
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:47,816
I AM, SET AN APPOINTMENT.

1684
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:49,217
SET AN APPOINTMENT.

1685
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:50,485
THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING.

1686
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:53,555
I DONT KNOW IF ITS LIKE, YOU
APPROACH ME OR I APPROACH YOU,

1687
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,024
BUT I FEEL LIKE THE
CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HAD

1688
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:58,994
OVER FAST COUPLE DAYS HAVE BEEN
VERY DELIBERATE.

1689
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:03,398
YOU MAY NOT CHECK IN AGAIN WITH
EACH OTHER, BUT WERE LOCKED IN.

1690
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,801
YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRUST IN THOSE
PEOPLE THAT THATS WHATS

1691
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:06,968
HAPPENING.

1692
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,304
Jeff: MIKE, YOU HAVE TO
MENTION THE FACT THAT THE LAST

1693
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:16,011
THREE PEOPLE VOTED OUT WERE
GOLIATHS.

1694
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:19,948
SO IS TONIGHTS VOTE AS SIMPLE
AS DAVIDS JUST PICKING OFF A

1695
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:20,882
GOLIATH?

1696
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,918
HONESTLY, NO, TRIBAL LINES
HAVE BLURRED.

1697
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:27,055
I WON THE REWARD CHALLENGE WITH
CARL AND DAVIE AND KARA.

1698
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,057
ILL REMEMBER THAT DAY FOR THE
REST OF MY LIFE.

1699
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:32,394
SO MOMENTS LIKE THAT CHANGE
RELATIONSHIPS.

1700
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:35,897
Jeff: ANGELINA, CONCERN YOU
AT ALL THIS WHEN PEOPLE GO ON A

1701
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,767
REWARD IT CAN BE SO POWERFUL
THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY IMPACT A

1702
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,001
VOTE?

1703
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:43,004
I THINK THERES A LITTLE BIT
OF NERVOUS ENERGY, BUT I THINK

1704
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:47,409
THERE ARE CLEAR EYES AND FULL
HEARTS FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE HERE,

1705
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:49,477
AND MAYBE NOT FOR OTHERS.

1706
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:54,583
FOR ME SECURING THE RICE WITH
YOU WAS PROOF THAT THERE IS A

1707
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,184
STRONG GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO I
TRUST.

1708
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,120
HAD I NOT HAD THAT BACKING, I
WOULDNT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE

1709
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:02,324
THE CONFIDENCE THAT I DID TO
MAKE THE DEAL WITH YOU TODAY TO

1710
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,292
GET RICE FOR THE REST OF THE
GAME.

1711
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:07,262
Jeff: ALISON, DO YOU CONCUR
WITH ANGELINA THAT THERE IS A

1712
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:08,463
CLEAR PLAN FOR TONIGHTS TRIBAL?

1713
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:09,698
NOT NECESSARILY.

1714
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:13,468
I HAVE A LOT MORE APPREHENSION
ABOUT THE PLAN, BUT I JUST HAVE

1715
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:17,439
TO PUT FAITH AT THIS POINT
BECAUSE I WAS TWO LETTERS SHORT

1716
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:18,773
