20

<i>We understood each other's</i>

31
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,431
<i>We liked each other's</i>
<i>personalities.</i>

32
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,517
It was a-a immediate bond.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,518
Everybody...

34
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,855
The personalities didn't clash,
they clicked.

35
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,731
Are those your
real color eyes there?

36
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,691
-Mm-hmm. -Oh, okay.

37
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,984
-They just brown.
-Cool.

<i>GHANDIA: I was happy that Ted</i>
<i>was on my same team.</i>

39
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,242
This is the longest I have ever
been away from my husband.

40
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,453
<i>He's my best friend,</i>
<i>my homeboy, everything to me.</i>

41
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,875
<i>And Ted brings that home</i>
<i>to me, you know?</i>

42
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,794
<i>It's kind of like my husband's</i>
<i>here with me chilling,</i>

43
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,130
<i>and that really</i>
<i>made me feel good.</i>

44
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,091
And he's so good to hug.
(laughs)

45
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,844
<i>He's just, he's just cool.</i>

<i>I've ever felt in my life,</i>

48
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,805
<i>the most fatigued and most</i>
<i>drained I've ever felt.</i>

49
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,518
None of us have the energy
to do anything.

50
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:52,190
My feet, they're just blistered
all to heck, peeling off.

51
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,984

<i>we're terrible outdoorsmen.</i>

54
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,824
We are starving!

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,076
We're starving.

56
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,079
Look at me,
I'm, like, Ally McBeal size.

57
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,209
So far, we haven't been
very successful

58
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,627
getting fish in the net.

59

doing something wrong--

<i>I'm not sure--</i>
<i>so I'm not so sure</i>

61
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,884
<i>how rewarding</i>
<i>that net is to us.</i>

62
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,095
I'd like a big plate of
cheese and crackers.

63
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,431

64
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,432
<i>You know what?</i>

65
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,684
<i>We got the net</i>
<i>in that challenge</i>

66
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,812
<i>and we're trying to figure out</i>
<i>how to make it work.</i>

67
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,522
Nobody's ever
lived on the beach,

68
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,315
nobody's ever
been around the water.

69
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,609
<i>We don't really know how</i>
<i>to work it.</i>

70
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,154
All that work for nothing.

71
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,366
Wait, we have one.

JED:
Nice.

73
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,745
You know, it's kind of strange

74
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,873
to be out here and see where
all the fish comes from

75
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,709
that I eat every day at home...

76
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,588
...and not have any idea
how to get it. (chuckles)

GHANDIA:<i> I feel a little tired</i>

78
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,361
<i>a lot of sleep last night.</i>

79
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,031
I just feel kind of depressed,

80
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:23,865
<i>I feel used.</i>

GHANDIA:
Sure.

84
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,496
<i>Ted and I have gotten close,</i>

85
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,082
<i>and it always seems that</i>
<i>I'm sleeping next to him.</i>

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,754
<i>And so, last night,</i>
<i>he threw his arm over me</i>

87
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,423
<i>and really pulled me close</i>
<i>into him,</i>

88
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:45,053
<i>which was kind of okay with me</i>
<i>in the beginning, but, um,</i>

89
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,429
he started to, like,
really...

90
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:53,227
uh, become very,
kind of, sexual.

91
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,939
I mean, specifically, he was
grinding against, against me.

92
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,069
<i>And he didn't stop.</i>

93
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:06,657
<i>He kept trying to--</i>
<i>in my opinion-- engage me.</i>

94
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,661
<i>I think Ted's actions</i>

95
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,414
are inappropriate
because he's married

96
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,667
and because he just had a baby,
like, two weeks ago.

97
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,379
And also because he should
respect me as a married woman

98
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,007
and respect my marriage, also.

99
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,012
<i>You can't just</i>
<i>do Ghandia like that.</i>

100
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,972
<i>You can't... I mean...</i>

101
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,976
I'm just not gonna go for it.

102
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,312
You went up on me
last night, tough.

103
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,314
That's, that's, like,
you know what I do?

104
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,150
Sometimes when I'm sleeping,
you know, it's like

105
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,362
in the middle of the night,
I'm not, like, totally clear.

106
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,323
I'm thinking I'm sleeping with
my wife, so I think what we need

107
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,451
to do is I'm not gonna hug you,
I'm not gonna hold you

108
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,619
because I keep on
forgetting that I'm,

109
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,954
like, not in the bed
with my wife.

110
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,289
-Right, right, right.
-So I'm, like...

111
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,874
But it was really
compromising for me,

112
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,835
and I just feel
like such trash today.

113
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,381
Don't, because, I mean, when
I do that, I'm not thinking...

114
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,591
I'm not, like,
in my total mind trying to,

115
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,717
like, start something with you,

116
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,010
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

117
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,846
...and I apologize
if I've offended you.

118
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,305
GHANDIA:
Yeah.

119
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,975
I mean, it wasn't done
maliciously, it wasn't done

120
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,017
trying to start something
or anything like that.

121
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,144
GHANDIA:
Mm-hmm.

122
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,814
Please, from the bottom
of my heart, I do apologize.

123
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,399
Why are you crying?
What's wrong?

124
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,151
-Because...
-What's wrong?

125
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,862
Because that's happened
to me before.

126
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,655
Did it really? Honestly?

127
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,657
I was raped before, in college.

128
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,825
-Were you really?
-Mm-hmm.

129
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,368
Get out of here.

130
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,370
Yeah, I think...
I apologize.

131
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:37,415
And I've had people tell me that
I bring it on myself and stuff.

132
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,708
-No...
-And for a minute this morning,

133
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,627
I thought were you gonna try to
pretend like it didn't happen.

134
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,754
No, uh-uh. I was planning on
talking to you later on,

135
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,047
but I didn't have, like,
an opportunity...

136
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,883
-I'm sorry.
-...to talk to you about it.

137
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,385
I'm really glad you apologized.
That makes me feel a lot better.

138
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,220
No, seriously, I apologize
a million times.

139
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,055
-Okay, okay.
-Can you forgive me?

140
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,725
-Yes, I can.
-Okay, all right.

141
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,226
Thank you. Seriously.

142
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,395
-You're a good person, Ted.
-And don't worry.

143
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,772
You don't have to worry about
that ever happening again.

144
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,566
-Okay. -You got it?

145
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,734

Welcome, guys.

155
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,764
-TED: What's up, Jeff?
-GHANDIA: Thank you.

156
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:39,227
Well, as you may or may not
know, as recently as the 1960s,

157
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,103
this island was ruled by pirates

158
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,481
who would rob and steal
from passing boats.

159
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,233
That ties in
to today's challenge.

160
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,735
Today's challenge is a race
along this bamboo course.

161
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,030
At the end of the course,
two boats-- one for each tribe.

162
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:55,117
Your goal:
rob or steal ten items

163
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,453
from the other tribe's boat,
back to your boat.

164
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,955
First tribe to do so wins.

165
00:08:59,038 --> 00:08:59,830
Here are the rules:

166
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,958
You can only take
one item at a time.

167
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,253
You can only have two members
on a course at any time.

168
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,464
If you fall off, you lose
the item you were carrying

169
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,258
and you go back to the start.

170
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,260
In the center of the course,
there's an attack zone.

171
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,304
It is clearly marked
in black-and-gold cloth.

172
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,139
If you are in the attack zone,

173
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,017
you can engage contact
with somebody else who is

174
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,644
also in the attack zone

175
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,272
and try to push them off
the course into the water.

176
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,983
If you are not in the attack
zone when you engage contact,

177
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,651
you're out of the game.

178
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,486
And one item
from your tribe's boat goes

179
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,654
into the other tribe's boat.

180
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,823
Want to know
what you're playing for?

181
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,824
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

182
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,033
Bring it in!

183
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,954
Here's your reward.

184
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:48,421
For 24 hours you will have two
Red Berets: Thai Special Forces.

185
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,007
These guys know how
to live off this land.

186
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,842
You can use them to help
improve your shelter,

187
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,888
fix a boat or source every bit
of edible food in your camp.

188
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,889
So when this is done,

189
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,018
you ought to know how
to do this for yourself.

190
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,188
(all agreeing cheerfully)

191
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,024
Thanks, guys.
See you in a little bit.

192
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,525
Sook Jai, because
you have two extra members,

193
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:10,860
you're sitting two out.

194
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,445
Who's sitting?
Jake and Erin.

195
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,238
Take your spots.
Wait for my go.

196
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,992
Here we go, guys,
great reward at stake.

197
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,410
-Survivors ready?
-Yeah!

198
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,161
Go!

199
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,871
Go, go, go, go, go!

200
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,581
You got that, baby.

201
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,086
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

202
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,880
No, no, no, Ted.
Back to the start.

203
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,298
-Go, go, go!
-He's got to go back.

204
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,176
No, no, no!

205
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,719
PROBST:
No, that one's dead.

206
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,887
In the water.
In the water.

207
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,055
Clay, back to the start.

208
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,557
One for Sook Jai.

209
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,354
Two for Sook Jai.

210
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,940
Chuay Gahn, one.

211
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,112
Three for Sook Jai.

212
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,698
Chuay Gahn, two.

213
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,034
Stephanie, back to the start.

214
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,247
Thataway to get inventive, Ted.

215
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,083
Sook Jai four; Chuay Gahn, two.

216
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,959
Got a showdown.

217
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,753
Are you standing and trying
to punk me, bro?

218
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,047
I'm doing
what I've gotta do, baby.

219
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,424
Get in the black zone, Ted.

220
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,301
(gasps)

221
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,803
Go, go, go.

00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,721
PROBST:

00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,897
Sook Jai five;
Chuay Gahn, three.

225
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,943
Come on!
Drag him in with you!

226
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,985
Come on, girl!

227
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:35,945
You want me to push him in?

228
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,197
Push him in-- yeah,
go ahead, push him!

229
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,448
(teams shouting)

230
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,201
Make sure you're both
in the attack zone.

231
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,621
Turn him in the water with you!

232
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,459
(woman whooping)

233
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,129
PROBST: Sook Jai, six;

00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,137
Sook Jai, seven;

237
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,890
The man from New York
holding forth.

238
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,475
Go, go, go, go!

239
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,810
First one to ten wins.

240
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,062
Bust him up like he
stole somebody's wife!

241
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,818
Penny with another one
for Sook Jai.

242
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,154
That's eight to four
for Chuay Gahn.

243
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,990
Stay there! Ken, go get her!

244
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,992
-Yeah! -Whoo!

245
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,368
Whoa, whoa, guys, hold up!

246
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,163
Ken, you were
not in the attack zone

247
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,122
when you first made contact.

248
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,623
You're out of the game.

249
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,834
One of Sook Jai's baskets
goes to Chuay Gahn.

250
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,045
Sook Jai seven;
Chuay Gahn five.

251
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,548
Don't get too cute in
that attack zone, guys.

252
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,385
No, no, no!

253
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,304
No!

254
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,805
You have to be in there, too!

255
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,016
Robb, you were not in
the attack zone

256
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,018
when you grabbed Clay
around the throat.

257
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,436
You're out of the game.

258
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,606
Another basket from Sook Jai
goes to Chuay Gahn.

259
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,026
The score is tied now: 6-6.

260
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,361
Bunch of little whiny babies.

261
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,655
Sook Jai, you're
self-destructing. Let's go.

262
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,656
The first one to ten wins.

263
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,033
GHANDIA:
Careful, Ted.

264
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,414
Grab him! Grab his legs!

265
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,459
(yells)

266
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,835
Stephanie, what are you doing?

267
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,045
You were in the water

268
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,172
and you weren't close
to the attack zone.

269
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,340
Another penalty.

270
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,050
Chuay Gahn is now ahead: seven.

271
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,885

And Stephanie
is out of the game.

273
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,348
Eight, Chuay Gahn.

274
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,891
Five, Sook Jai.

TED: Am I in the zone?
Am I in the zone?

276
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,895
Just grab ahold of him.

277
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,855
Jump on his back
and hold onto him.

278
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,775
Grab his shirt.

Behind you, Ted!

282
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,743
GHANDIA:
Watch out, B! Watch out, B!

283
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,746
He's not in it.

284
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,583
PROBST: No, Jed, you weren't
in the attack zone

285
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,253
-when you first made contact.
-Yes! Yes!

286
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,796
Come on, guys.
I'm like a broken record.

287
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,755
Jed, join your tribe members.

288
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,257
You're out of the game, too.

289
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,885

goes to Chuay Gahn.

290
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,221
Chuay Gahn, nine;
Sook Jai four.

291
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,722
Chuay Gahn is one basket away.

292
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,808
TED:
Am I in the zone?

293
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,725
(barking)

294
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,602
Chuay Gahn at nine,

295
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,104
just needs one more.

296
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,564
Clay has it.

297
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,565
Come on, Clay.

298
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,067
Slow, Clay, slow.

299
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,610
Easy, Clay, easy, steady.

300
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,737
Yeah!

301
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,489
Chuay Gahn wins reward!

302
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,285
(all cheering, shouting)

303
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,290
PROBST: Chuay Gahn,
two Red Berets for 24 hours.

304
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,083
(cheering)

305
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,253
TED:
Love ya, baby.

306
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,131
Fish! Fish!

307
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,991
CLAY:
So we lost one, huh?

308
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,118
ROBB:
<i>I don't mind getting beaten.</i>

309
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,121
But after the reward challenge,
I was so bitter.

310
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:14,830
We got chumped.

311
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,332
That last time, he came at me

312
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,959
and I put my hands out
and pushed him in.

313
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,461
He's a weak little whiny punk.

314
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,213
Backwoods hick.

315
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,175
Did you hear him...
(mimics goofy yelling)

316
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,301
Screaming at me, dude.

317
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,178
I wanted to spit in his face.

318
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,138
<i>Robb, idiot that he is,</i>

319
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,015
he talks so much.
He can't even...

320
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,351
There's no way a logical thought
goes through his brain

321
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,353
'cause his mouth is
always flapping.

322
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,354
ROBB:
That's all I'm saying.

323
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,647
We're eight strong.

324
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,190
We're gonna go into this
immunity challenge--

325
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,107
the one that counts--

326
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,026
we're gonna
kick their ass, bottom line.

327
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,527
We got beat today, dude,

328
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,821
but it wasn't by
somebody better than us.

329
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,324
Okay, I'm not gonna be
a sore loser.

330
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,534
We lost, dude, we lost
by a bunch of rules.

331
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,702
You know what, though?
Who gives a ...?

332
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,705
'Cause I got a good shot on
homeboy from the backwoods,

333
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,541
and big Teddy wasn't so big,
that's what I'm saying.

334
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,336
<i>I was a little bit disappointed</i>
<i>when I saw what the reward was.</i>

335
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,587
<i>I mean, it could have</i>
<i>been useful</i>

336
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,381
<i>to have the Red Berets</i>
<i>maybe help us</i>

337
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,051
with our shelter, but otherwise,
I mean, I was hoping

338
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,553
they'd bring, like, a big turkey
or something.

339
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,847
(chuckles)

to our Green Berets in the U.S.

GHANDIA: I'm gonna tell you
something else,

391
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:30,025
last night Ted was on me while
he was sleeping next to me.

392
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,653
And then when I confronted him
to let him know it wasn't cool,

393
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,655
he told me that when
he's sleeping, he's in a fog.

394
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,906
HELEN: Ah, yeah.
Yeah, right.

395
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,032
Mm-hmm, yeah, mm-hmm.

396
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:40,369
That made me feel like such
a trashy piece of trash.

397
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,537
Mm-hmm, I don't blame you.

398
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,706
And now I'm feeling that I need
to stick with the women.

399
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,042
<i>I accepted Ted's apology</i>
<i>to his face,</i>

400
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,378
<i>but then when I had time</i>
<i>to think about it,</i>

401
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,588
I kind of thought that
the excuse he gave me was

402
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,465
a little bit disingenuous;
a lot disingenuous.

403
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,425
He said, "Is it okay
if I hold you?"

404
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,219
HELEN: Well, and we're all
in there so close, yeah.

405
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,179
I said, "Yeah, that's fine,
because that comforts me."

406
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,264
HELEN:
Right, and you don't want

407
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,391
to act like you can't handle
the situation, you know?

408
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,600
-That makes you look bad.
-Right.

409
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,603
<i>So I just started telling</i>
<i>everybody in the tribe</i>

410
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,314
<i>what happened because I felt</i>
<i>that everybody in the tribe</i>

411
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,859
<i>should know what he did.</i>

412
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,527
And I was a little hard on him

413
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,572
in retelling the story
to everybody.

414
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,699
So then when he moved his hand
on my shoulder,

415
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,868
he started biting me on
my shoulder, back here,

416
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,078
like sexy biting, you know
how you bite somebody's...

417
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,913
-Mm-hmm.
-Then it was on from there.

418
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,748
I was, like, "This is some ....

419
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,042
"Your wife just had a baby
a ... week ago,

420
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,210
"and you bump ... on my ass?

421
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,295
You're happily married."

422
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,922
But every part of the story
that I told was true.

423
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,382
The only part that I think

424
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,509
that I think I probably left out
is that he apologized.

425
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,078
I wake up at the end
of my little nap,

426
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,789
after I delegate my duties,

427
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,876
<i>and there's no fishing net</i>
<i>to be found.</i>

428
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:23,013
<i>Me and Robb walked around</i>
<i>the beach in search for it,</i>

429
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,475
<i>and basically,</i>
<i>whoever last was watching it</i>

430
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,979
just didn't delegate off duties,
and let it drift away.

431
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,650
<i>ROBB: We figured if we left</i>
<i>the net out for a while,</i>

432
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,318
<i>we might catch some fish</i>

433
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,111
and we might eat and feel good.

434
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,614
Well, the damn net floated away.

435
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,950
We don't know where the net is.
(chuckles)

436
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,620
PENNY: Tell you what, I sure
would feel ten times better

437
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,122
-if I could eat something.
-I would, too.

438
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,709
-We found some sour berries.
-Cool.

439
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,294
Well, we got some great news.

440
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,630
We've lost the net.

441
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,881
What?

442
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,843
We don't have a clue
where that net is.

443
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,720
PENNY:
That sucks.

444
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,683
<i>Those boys took</i>
<i>the fishing net out,</i>

445
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,519
"We're gonna leave it out in
the ocean for hours and hours."

446
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,063
<i>Okay, we come back, it's gone.</i>

447
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,523
<i>Why?</i>

448
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,607
Jed was sleeping.

449
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,860
So, because Jed was sleeping
and unwilling to get up,

450
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,655
<i>the fishing net went bye-bye.</i>

451
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,740
<i>It just sailed away.</i>

452
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,614
HELEN:
Yeah, yeah, wrong, yeah.

453
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,949
(Ted laughs)

454
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,625
HELEN:<i> Today is the first day</i>
<i>that I really realized</i>

00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,918
<i>I'm playing</i> Survivor.

00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,003
<i>I know that sounds silly,</i>

457
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,589
<i>but I guess</i>
<i>I got in the mode out here</i>

458
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,053
<i>where I was surviving</i>
<i>off the land; I really did.</i>

459
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:30,766
I've been focusing on that, and
forgetting that there's a game

460
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,726
going on here psychologically.

461
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,729
And you could have blown me away
with the Ted and Ghandia thing.

462
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,731
-What?
-It's kind of serious, yeah.

463
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,608
That's why
she's been depressed all day.

464
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,611
-Wow. -I guess it got
pretty bad, so...

465
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,945
I was completely asleep.

466
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,614
And she said--
you know, me, too.

467
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,741
-I didn't even know.
-I didn't know either, yeah.

468
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,909
That's highly depressing.
Okay, I hear you.

469
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,453
I agree. I feel the same way
because, all of a sudden,

470
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,121
the person I thought
I was dealing with

471
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,456
is absolutely not the person
I'm dealing with.

472
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,624
Whew.

473
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,959
So...

474
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,836
I just don't think that's cool.

475
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,799
Um, but I'm just letting you
know what we're gonna do,

476
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,592
the three of us are
gonna take him out next time.

477
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,927
Okay, okay.

478
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,012
Just letting you know
that and where we are.

479
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,973
<i>It was quite a surprise when</i>
<i>it got back to me that there's</i>

a problem with Ghandia and Ted,
and I'm, like, I'm just,

481
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,521
the first thing I'm thinking is
that I'm highly disappointed

482

<i>or what wasn't happening.</i>

485
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,945
<i>I wanted to sit back and hear</i>
<i>both sides of the story.</i>

486
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,696
-All right, let me digest this.
-Yep.

487
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,824
-We'll talk about it tomorrow.
-That's fine, that's fine.

488
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,742
-Thank you, Helen.
-Yeah, yeah.

489
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,831
(sighs)
Oh, boy.

490
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,998

00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,681
and adding and adding.

494

I'll just say it this way...

507
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,880
I mean, I'm a man,
man of my word.

508
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,049
I mean, a mistake happened,
and I rectified it.

509
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,885
-Good. Good.
-So...

510
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,261
-Honest mistake. -Nothing
happened, though, right?

511
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,387
-No, nothing at all. -Good.

512
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,390
-Nothing happened at all.
-Good.

513
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,517
That's all I need to hear.
That's all I need to hear.

514
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,518
That's the thing that's tripping
me out, man-- know what I mean?

515
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,228
All I need to hear.

516
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,354
That's all I need to hear--
nothing happened.

517
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,857
Ted told me
that nothing happened,

518
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,152
which he was denying
anything happened,

519
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,279
which is fine
because nothing did happen.

520
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,031
<i>I interpreted it as they</i>
<i>might've been close,</i>

521
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,532
<i>but there was no contact.</i>

522
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,784
<i>There might've been a hand here</i>
<i>or a ankle here</i>

523
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,912
<i>or an earlobe here or something</i>
<i>simple as that.</i>

524
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,413
Case closed.

525
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,915
What's the side
you're getting-- just denial

526
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,750
or that she came on to him?

527
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,084
Um, no, just more denial.

528
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,711
Yeah, okay.

529
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,255
<i>And then as Helen was walking</i>
<i>by me, I mentioned</i>

530
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,965
<i>that he denied everything;</i>
<i>he said nothing happened.</i>

531
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,052
I didn't realize that Helen
would run right back to her,

532
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,970
<i>but I was surprised she went</i>
<i>right back to Ghandia</i>

533
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,722
<i>and said, "Brian said that Ted</i>
<i>told him nothing happened."</i>

534
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,723
(wry laughter)

535
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,599
He didn't do anything.

536
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,643
So... you got a knife
in your hand.

537
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,769
He didn't do anything.

538
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,730
<i>I want to just punch</i>
<i>his ass in the eye.</i>

539
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,982
-He didn't do anything.
-Now, if it comes down to...

540
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,235
-He didn't do nothing?
-No, no, it never happened.

541
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,445
I guess it was a figment
of your imagination, yeah.

542
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,447
No, no.

543
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,531
Ghandia, I wouldn't...

544
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,787
<i>I heard from Helen</i>
<i>that Ted told Brian</i>

545
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,915
<i>that nothing happened,</i>
<i>and something did happen,</i>

546
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,960
<i>which really,</i>
<i>really set me off.</i>

547
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,631
(screams)

548
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,175
What was that?

549
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,969
TED: What the ... was that?
What?

550
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:58,181
I-I... It's...
just-just crazy lady.

551
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,476
(grunting)

552
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,311
CLAY:<i> That was</i>
<i>the most childish act</i>

553
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,854
<i>she's done so far here.</i>

554
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,481
Ghandia gonna
go down to the beach and cry

555
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,108
and holler and carry on.

556
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,943
My two-year-old did that
one time,

557
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,487
and I whupped its ass
and put it back in bed.

558
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,489
Bastard!

559
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,783
Piece of ...!

560
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,410
Pig.

561
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,120
Liar!

562
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,497
Cheat!

563
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,793
Butt crack showing
every damn day.

564
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,505
Rambo, if you could
only understand

565
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,465
how much bull...
going on around this camp.

566
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,050
You don't understand.

567
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,303
Actually, it's good that you
don't understand what's going on

568
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,556
'cause there's
a lot of bull... going on.

569
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,476
(muttering angrily)

570
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,312
You lying piece of...

571
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,106
Sorry.

572
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,526
TED:
<i>Ghandia was making an issue</i>

573
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,361
<i>that was very, very small,</i>

574
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,863
that could have been handled in

575
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,197
a very professional,
one-on-one manner,

576
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,992
and has exploded it
into an issue

577
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,370
<i>that goes beyond me</i>
<i>and beyond this game.</i>

578
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,373
Ghandia, I think we need to have
a talk in front of everyone.

579
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,291
Oh, for real, yeah.

580
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,542
I think so, too.

581
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,960
I think the sooner the better.

582
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,837
Mm-hmm, I'd like
it to happen right now.

583
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,380
You want to have it now?

584
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,215
-Mm-hmm.
-All right, cool. Okay.

585
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:21,222
Yo, Brian, Janny,
we're gonna have a talk!

586
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,392
<i>I told all the tribe members</i>
<i>to come in together</i>

587
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,521
<i>'cause I was tired of all this,</i>
<i>you know, rumors going around</i>

588
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,566
and people getting confused on
what the facts are, et cetera.

589
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:35,779
The other night, I was waking up
when the event happened;

590
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:40,533
I was waking up,
and from some crazy reason,

591
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:45,580
you know, in that position,
I started grinding on Ghandia,

592
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,749
maybe two or three times,
before realizing

593
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,084
"Whoa, sh...
this isn't my wife."

594
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,211
We talked about it,
and I said to Ghandia,

595
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,255
"I am totally apologize and
I explained to her exactly

596
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,633
what happened, the same way
I'm explaining to you guys.

597
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,134
And what sparked this meeting,

598
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,887
I hear Ghandia saying that,
you know, I'm denying it.

599
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,639
I am not denying ...

600
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,599
You didn't deny it to Brian?
You didn't say ...?

601
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,600
I didn't deny ...

602
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,644
I am not denying ...!

603
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,896
Helen told me
that you denied it to Brian.

604
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,606
Well, that's what you get for
listening to other people

605
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,274
when I told you in your face.

606
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,442
Here's my, here's my issue
of clarification:

607
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,610
You said that you woke up

608
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,779
-and you realized that you were
making a mistake. -Yes.

609
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,948
So you didn't bite me on
the back of my shoulder,

610
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,616
-you didn't kiss me on
my shoulder? -No.

611
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,119
You didn't put your hand in
my head and rub my hair?

612
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,245
Please. Come on.
Ghandia, you're blowing it.

613
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,664
And then when I changed
positions again, you put your

614
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,791
hand in my hair
and you was massaging my head.

615
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,459
-No. -You was trying...
To me, I got the feeling

616
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,044
that you was trying
to get with me.

617
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,422
No, no. First of all,

618
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,465
-I don't need to get with you.
-I know you don't.

619
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,134
Second of all, I'm not even
attracted to you.

620
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:43,513
So, I mean, it's not,
it's not even about that.

621
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:50,770
I am, I am 150 to 200% happy
with the wife that I have,

622
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,356
that I've chose to spend
the rest of my life with.

623
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,276
I mean,
that's my love right there.

624
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,320
And I have a daughter,
that's my ... love.

625
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,991
Your version of what happened...

626
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,619
I just, I just want you to be
honest, but you don't remember.

627
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,830
You don't remember biting me
on my shoulder;

628
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,458
you don't remember
kissing me on my shoulder?

629
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,333
Ghandia. Ghandia...

630
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,543
That just made me uncomfortable.
Hold on.

631
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:17,005
And then the excuse that you
gave me that you were in a fog

632
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,673
and you thought
that I was your wife,

633
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:19,924
I thought that that was
disingenuous.

634
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,134
I thought
that that was disingenuous.

635
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,303
That's funny because your
comment after I apologized was

636
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,513
to cry and say, "You know,
I really, really needed that

637
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,890
and I really appreciate
your honesty."

638
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,850
I did, I did.

639
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,519
So if you didn't feel
that I was disingenuous,

640
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,480
then you would have,
you would have addressed it

641
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,689
right then and said,

642
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,232
"Look, Ted, I don't believe
your apologies."

643
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,401
All-all it is now is that it's
all out on the table,

644
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,402
it's all out in the open.

645
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,196
-We all understand
what happened. -Ghandia...

646
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,490
And then from here, we just go
and we just start,

647
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,033
and we just go on from here.

648
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,703
It's in front of everybody
and it's off, it's over.

649
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,872
I agree, I agree
with this clean slate.

650
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,749
Let's go fishing.

651
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,336
Again, once again, last time,
I apologize for everyone, okay?

652
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,046
It's a new day.
Let's start it right now.

653
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,047
Cool.

655
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,679
If the drama continued or
if I wasn't straight forth

656
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,931

00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,314
SHII ANN:
That's pretty. Wow.

675
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,440
-Hey, guys!
-Treemail!

676
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,943
Treemail! Thank ya.

677
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:07,073
"Plan it, move it, build it
higher and higher,

678
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:11,786
"only one tribe can be the first
to cap the golden spire.

679
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:14,622
"Put your minds together,
you need to work as one.

680
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,959
If not, then for one of you,
your island time is done."

ERIN:<i> When we started off,</i>
<i>we didn't think</i>

682
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,591
<i>we could have picked</i>
<i>a better team.</i>

683
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,468
<i>All I know is that the majority</i>
<i>of us don't really care</i>

684
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,554
<i>whether or not we win</i>
<i>the immunity.</i>

685
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,306
<i>We're actually hoping</i>
<i>that we lose.</i>

686
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,891
We're ready
to get rid of some people.

687
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,318
PROBST:
Come on in, guys.

688
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,488
First things first.
Penny, gotta take it back.

689
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,949
Immunity back up for grabs.

690
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,827
Today's challenge
is called Temple Transfer.

691
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,787
And it's very simple in
its concept,

692
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,165
but it's a lot harder
than it looks.

693
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,375
<i>The temple is made up</i>
<i>of six pieces,</i>

694
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,628
<i>each tribe has three platforms.</i>

695
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,631
Your challenge is
to transfer your temple

696
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,468
<i>from platform one to platform</i>
<i>three using all three platforms</i>

697
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,844
<i>to solve the puzzle.</i>

698
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:13,014
You can only move
one piece at a time,

699
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,267
<i>and in addition, you can never</i>
<i>have a larger piece</i>

700
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,727
<i>on top of a smaller piece.</i>

701
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,812
Finally, all of
your tribe members must be

702
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,523
<i>inside the white ring</i>
<i>before you can move on</i>

703
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,025
<i>to the next platform.</i>

704
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,860
It will take
your collective brainpower

705
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:26,944
to solve this puzzle.

706
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,490
Sook Jai, you've chosen Ken
and Penny to sit out.

707
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,824
Take your spots.
Wait for my go.

708
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,080
Here we go, immunity at stake.

709
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,164
Survivors ready?

710
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,707
-Yes! -Ready!

711
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,459
-Go!
-Go. Go.

a small piece on top

-Which way we going?
-Uh, right over there. -Okay.

722
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,243
You got it?

723
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,246
Over here-- we're going over
here, over here to there.

724
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,456
Back to me.

725
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,923
Down.

726
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,925
Spire over there,
little piece back over there.

727
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,427
Come on, Sook Jai!

728
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,221
PROBST:
Use all three platforms.

729
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,597
Bring the spire over here,

730
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,141
bring the big piece over there

731
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,101
-'cause it's smaller.
-Right. And then we... Okay.

732
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,769
-And then we start
unstacking them. -Yes.

733
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,979
All right, let's get them.

734
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,106
Wait... Hold on...

735
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,774
Is this piece smaller?

736
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:51,279
Okay, okay, let's go change
that one and put it on the...

737
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,780
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

Boom, boom, boom.

No, no, no. We got it.

740
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,620
We got it.

741
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,623
-Nice and easy. -Step up.
-Step up, up...

742
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,417

-Drop it!

Come on, Sook Jai.

00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,144
Come on, guys, don't give up,
don't give up.

751
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,021
-Set that one on the top.
-Thanks, baby.

Hand-in-hand, guys.

Chuay Gahn on their last move.

Take that one off of there,
come back with that one.

No, no, hold on.

Need some rain. Rain!

764
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:01,432
Chuay Gahn, get a little feel
of this for a change.

765
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,517
No Tribal Council tonight.

766
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,685
Congratulations, guys.

767
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,395
-Have a good night's sleep.
-You got it.

768
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,528
Sook Jai, our first date
at Tribal Council.

769
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,696
You guys can head back to camp,
grab your torches.

770
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,365
I'll see you there.

771
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,661
We worked together.

772
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,888
SHII ANN:
<i>We just lost immunity.</i>

773
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,931
<i>Surprise.</i>

774
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,393
You see, I could do a logic
puzzle in my sleep.

775
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,229
<i>That one that we did today--</i>

776
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,230
<i>so easy.</i>

777
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,565
<i>What happened?</i>

778
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,941
I could have stepped in.

779
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,401
Jake could have stepped in.

780
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,195
But did we step in? No.

781
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,532
Bless her heart, dude, but
Shii Ann just gets on my nerves.

782
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,284
(laughs)

783
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,411
I think the majority of
the tribe has decided

784
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,288
that Shii Ann is
our weakest member.

785
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,415
<i>The poor girl</i>
<i>just doesn't click.</i>

786
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,750
<i>You know, it seems like</i>
<i>she almost tries too hard.</i>

787
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,961
She's got on
all our nerves, you know?

788
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,004
She's a good girl, man,

789
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,590
but I mean, she's our weakest
member for sure.

790
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,301
<i>We've got a few lazy people--</i>
<i>I mean, some are trying</i>

791
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,886
to hide it better than others,

792
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,222
but Jed, it's not that
he's not valuable.

793
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,557
He's just flat-out lazy.

794
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,725
He doesn't do anything.

795
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,268
He lays around all day.

796
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,312
<i>I don't dislike Jed,</i>
<i>but I do think that,</i>

797
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,439
for the most part,
he was lazy in the beginning,

798
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,401
and he did a lot of things that
pissed a lot of people off.

799
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:39,113
See, it's different to be
just lazy and not help us,

800
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,073
<i>but he's lazy and hurting us.</i>

801
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,289
<i>We need to have some type of</i>
<i>harmony while we're out here,</i>

802
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,000
when we've got all the other
odds against us: the rain,

803
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,462
the heat, no food,
you know, not much water.

804
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,796
<i>So we need to have</i>

805
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,132
<i>some kind of unity out here,</i>
<i>and with certain people,</i>

806
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,800
<i>we really don't feel</i>
<i>like we have that.</i>

807
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,844
<i>So we'd rather</i>
<i>just get rid of them.</i>

808
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:18,611
PROBST: As you walk in, grab
a torch, approach the flame.

809
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,989
This is part of the ritual
of the first visit

810
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,076
to Tribal Council,
because fire represents

811
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,994
your life in this game.

812
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,497
As long as you have fire,
you're still in the game.

813
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,749
When your fire's gone,
so are you.

814
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,253
For those of you who are still

815
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,881
in the game
after tonight's Tribal Council,

816
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,676
you'll take these torches back
with you to your camp,

817
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:46,681
and bring them to
all future Tribal Councils.

818
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,183
So let's get right to it.

819
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,687
I haven't had a chance to get
to know much about you guys.

820
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,271
Shii Ann,
what surprised you the most,

821
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,190
in these first nine days,
that you didn't expect?

822
00:37:56,273 --> 00:38:00,361
Oh, I think the biggest thing
was a lack of food, actually.

823
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,612
And the shelter, I guess.

824
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,491
I expected more help, so that
was probably the biggest shock.

825
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:09,370
Jed, are you expecting food
in terms of a reward?

826
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,331
-Are you counting on that?
-We're not expecting anything.

827
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,042
I mean, we'll live on snails
for another week or two,

828
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,170
and then drop like flies
probably.

829
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,465
Robb, what's your role,
specifically, in this tribe?

830
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,718
Um, I think I'm just
the happy-go-lucky kid,

831
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,052
down to do whatever.

832
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,887
I'm just trying
to apply myself everywhere

833
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,848
and help and stay up,
stay happy.

834
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:32,309
At this point,
a lot of us are really drained.

835
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,895
I mean, you're used to eating so
much and having so much energy.

836
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,397
I'm a high-energy kind of guy.

837
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,857
I bounce off the walls,
you know?

838
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,525
I need a lot of energy,

839
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,611
and, man,
it's just so hard to come by.

840
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,947
PROBST: Stephanie, if food
continues to be an issue,

841
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,907
will it divide this tribe?

842
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,785
Will it get to a point where
it makes people angry

843
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,412
just because
they're so damn hungry?

844
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,580
Oh, it definitely will.

845
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,081
I mean,
it's already changed my mood.

846
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,417
I think it's a little bit harder
on people who are in

847
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,129
really good shape and need the
calories and their body's used

848
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,923
to burning a lot of calories,
to go without food.

849
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:03,966
I think that they tend
to sink faster.

850
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,510
I mean, it looks like that
in the tribe to me.

851
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,596
We're a group here.

852
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,389
It could get bad.

853
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,433
PROBST: So it's your first time
at Tribal Council.

854
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,062
It's never fun to vote somebody
out, I don't care who you are.

855
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,606
Jake, how about for you?
You picked this tribe.

856
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,941
How do you go about voting
your first person out?

857
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,778
I hate to do it 'cause I love
every one of these people,

858
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,238
so this one is gonna be a
really, really tough one for me.

859
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,115
I think what I'll probably do is

860
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,911
just take a strategic approach
and mosey over and vote.

861
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,412
It's time to vote.
Shii Ann, you're first.

862
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,190
If you did the half chores

863
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,817
you tried to delegate
to other people,

864
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,111
this wouldn't be happening.

865
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,844
Well, Shii Ann, you never
really seemed to click.

866
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,012
You sort of, uh,
got on my nerves.

867
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,472
You're a sweetheart, but, uh,

868
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,474
I'll catch you
on the flip side, baby.

869
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,620
I'll go tally the votes.

870
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,716
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

871
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,758
The person will be asked

872
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,385
to leave the Tribal Council
area immediately.

873
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,888
I'll read the votes.

874
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,893
First vote... Jed.

875
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,190
Jed. That's two votes-- Jed.

876
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,402
Shii Ann.

877
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,241
Shii Ann.

878
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,744
Two votes-- Jed,
two votes-- Shii Ann.

879
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,332
Shii Ann.

880
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,543
Three votes-- Shii Ann,
two votes-- Jed.

881
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,133
Jed. Three votes each.

882
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,306
That's four votes-- Jed.

883
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,730
Jed. That's five votes, Jed.

884
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,900
You need to bring me your torch.

885
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,368
Jed, the tribe has spoken.

886
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,958
Time for you to go.

887
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,638
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

888
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,889
Get a good night's sleep.

889
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,401
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

890
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:57,157
PROBST:<i> Next time on</i> Survivor,
<i>the tribes receive new members.</i>

891
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,492
CLAY:
There's a dummy over there.

892
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,702
I can't carry the damn thing.
I didn't...

893
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,037
-TED: Right. -I swear to God
there's a dummy over there.

894
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,664
Big as your ass!

895
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,832
PROBST:<i> And Chuay Gahn</i>
<i>is tearing apart.</i>

896
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,126
The relationship between Ghandia
and I is nonexistent.

897
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,836
I only see five people
on this island.

898
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,671
We ain't gonna be picking
each other apart,

899
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,006
and if they start that ...,

900
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,674
I'm gonna shut that ... down.
I don't care.

901
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,389
I mean, you don't see
anything coming,

902
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,474
<i>but any time you go</i>
<i>to Tribal Council,</i>

903
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,351
<i>your head's</i>

904
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,853
<i>whether it be a threat,</i>

905
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,022

906
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:32,192

907
