<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,256
Drop your buffs.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,007
It is now time to integrate.

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:08,466
The four-tribe ethnic

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,051
division...

7
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,720
You are the new Aitu tribe.

8
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,139
You are the new Raro tribe.

9
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,306
...dissolved into a melting

10
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,057
pot.

11
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:16,599
Two new tribes, a whole new

12
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,895
game.

13
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,396
At the new Raro tribe...

14
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,148
>> There are so many men on

15
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,274
this tribe now.

16
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,400
Seems like we got all the, like,

17
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,735
really big, buff guys.

18
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,277
Your pants are falling off,

19
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,027
Nate.

20
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,697
I'm absolutely going to flirt

21
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,614
with him.

22
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,240
It's what I do best.

23
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,451
>> PROBST: At the new Aitu...

24
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,452
>> I trust Yul, I trust

25
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,411
Candice.

26
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,287
>> I totally agree.

27
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:37,829
>> PROBST: ...new plans were

28
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,079
laid.

29
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,873
>> Becky came right to me.

30
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:40,790
She said, " Yul and I would

31
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,916
like to get together with you

32
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,584
and Candice."

33
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,460
I said, "I believe that I have

34
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,377
Flicka."

35
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,295
Stay with me and Candice and

36
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,421
we'll take these other two and

37
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,589
the five of us will go to the

38
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,548
merge.

39
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,424
>> PROBST: And Yul solidified

40
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,425
his bond with Becky.

41
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,509
>> I found the idol.

42
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,886
>> It's so awesome.

43
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,678
>> It's a huge advantage to

44
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,804
have someone that you absolutely

45
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,930
trust.

46
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,849
>> Oh, I'm so excited!

47
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,225
>> Give it all you got, go!

48
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,226
>> PROBST: During the immunity

49
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,144
challenge...

50
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,187
Yul going try to fight them off

51
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,730
as long as he can.

52
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,981
...Aitu was outmatched by the

53
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:07,066
brawn of the new Raro tribe.

54
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,778
Raro wins immunity.

55
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,320
Raro sent Candice to Exile

56
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,239
Island, saving her from tribal

57
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,450
council and jeopardizing the

58
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,202
Aitu alliance.

59
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,330
>> PROBST: Suddenly Becky was on

60
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,540
the chopping block.

61
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,792
>> Jonathan...

62
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,838
>> I thought Flicka was me, so

63
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,380
we've got a serious problem

64
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,341
here.

65
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,467
>> We have to let Becky go.

66
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,510
She's a princess out here.

67
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,677
>> She's not, like, weak, she's

68
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,762
strong.

69
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,846
>> PROBST: Yul and Jonathan

70
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,056
scrambled to save Becky.

71
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,140
>> If five of us vote for

72
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,850
Cecilia and three of you vote

73
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,227
for Becky, then all of a sudden

74
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,978
you're on the outside.

75
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,355
Trying to convince Flicka and

76
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,147
Cao Boi to vote with us is the

77
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,107
key.

78
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,317
If not, then, all bets are off

79
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,028
and it's going to be a whole

80
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,239
different kettle of fish.

81
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,782
>> PROBST: At tribal council it

82
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,867
came down to Becky or Cecilia.

83
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,409
In the end, it was Ozzy's

84
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,662
former tribemate who was voted

85
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,788
out.

86
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,455
Cecilia, the tribe has spoken.

87
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,750
17 are left.

88
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,293
Who will be voted out tonight?

89
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,327
>> At tribal council tonight it

90
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,370
came very close.

91
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,413
I received three votes and

92
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,832
Cecilia received five.

93
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,457
The alliance that I feel pretty

94
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,501
comfortable with and pretty

95
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,170
confident is Yul for sure,

96
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,547
Candice is right now on Exile

97
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,214
Island, she's still in the

98
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,258
alliance, and Jonathan said

99
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,342
that he would stay in the

100
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,552
alliance, too.

101
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,264
>> No, no.

102
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,307
>> Coconut.

103
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,601
>> I don't like hermit crabs.

104
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,935
I feel like I'm on the outside.

105
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,519
To lose the only member of my

106
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,438
former tribe, the person that

107
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,064
helped me lay the foundations

108
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,399
of everything that these people

109
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:11,941
are going to enjoy makes me

110
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,568
feel like crap.

111
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,950
If they want to vote me out

112
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,160
they should do it soon so I

113
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:22,744
don't have to keep catching

114
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,328
food for them.

115
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,370
I just don't feel like playing

116
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,206
along any more.

128
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,882
>> How was it?

129
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,300
>> No idol.

130
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,301
>> Oh, man.

131
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,471
>> I think probably because I'm

132
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,514
the youngest, or whatever.

133
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,562
>> You think they did it, like,

134
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,730
as a bad thing?

135
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,364
>> I don't know, you guys are

136
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,699
asking good questions because I

137
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,700
haven't even thought about any

138
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,492
of this.

139
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,785
I didn't have time.

140
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,245
I think probably Adam and

141
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:30,538
Parvati told their tribe to

142
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,873
send me to exile.

143
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,416
But I don't want the rest of

144
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,709
the team to think that I have

145
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,086
some special, you know, get out

146
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,587
of jail free card from the

147
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,379
other team.

148
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,380
And everybody's like, "Yeah,

149
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,423
what do you think, what do you

150
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,799
think?"

151
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,967
And I said, "Well, I don't

152
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,926
know, I hadn't thought about

153
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,802
that."

154
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,887
You know, just played dumb.

155
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,475
>> Oh, I didn't even think

156
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,476
about that.

157
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,436
My mind is...

158
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,661
>> Feels soft already.

160
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,419

161
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,797
>> I know.

162
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,381
It was kind of annoying that

163
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,883
the guys were just sitting and

164
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:24,509
just waiting there and drinking

165
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,636
all the coconuts they could

166
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,304
drink and the girls were, you

167
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,472
know, working on improving our

168
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,765
shelter.

169
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,100
They're starting to rule the

170
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,684
roost a little bit.

171
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,311
I think they're getting very

172
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:35,937
comfortable with their position

173
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,605
in this tribe.

174
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,773
Because they know that we need

175
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,108
them, they're strong.

176
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,614
>> No.

177
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,782
>> No way.

178
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,033
>> You think they were?

179
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,368
>> I don't know.

180
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,328
>> Even if they all do think,

181
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,538
what's that going to do to us?

182
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,958
Nothing.

183
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,209
You know, we're all fired up on

184
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:58,835
how dominant and strong we are

185
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,129
as a tribe right now.

186
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,630
As a group of guys we're way,

187
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,258
way stronger than the other

188
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,926
tribe's group of guys.

189
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,719
And I think the testosterone's

190
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,929
flying a little bit and the

191
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:10,596
guys want to stick together.

192
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,765
These girls are going to need

193
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,183
manpower for sure.

194
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:14,725
So the four guy alliance is

195
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,769
definitely relaxed.

196
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,985
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

197
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,742
Raro, getting your first look

198
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,702
at the new Aitu tribe.

199
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,371
Cecilia voted out at the last

200
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,498
tribal council.

201
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,047
All right, today's challenge is

202
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,591
for reward.

203
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,592
Each tribe will select two

204
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,303
tribe members to be attached by

205
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,554
belt to a very long rope that

206
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,765
snakes over, under and around a

207
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,059
series of obstacles.

208
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,561
The rest of the tribe will push

209
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,604
and pull those two tribe

210
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,814
members through all of the

211
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,316
obstacles.

212
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,442
At the end of the rope is a

213
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:04,775
decoder table.

214
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,861
Once the entire tribe reaches

215
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,821
the table, one tribe member will

216
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,572
swim out to a barrel, dive

217
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,284
down, unclip a decoding wheel.

218
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,535
Bring it back to shore and the

219
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,037
entire tribe will use that

220
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,621
decoding wheel to decipher one

221
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,581
phrase.

222
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,625
First tribe to correctly

223
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,336
decipher the phrase wins reward.

224
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,503
Want to know what you're

225
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,213
playing for?

226
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,047
>> Yes.

227
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,548
>> PROBST: Warmth and comfort.

228
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,093
Three blankets, two pillows,

229
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,637
one hammock.

230
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,096
In addition, the winning tribe

231
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,723
will choose one person from the

232
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,516
losing tribe to go to Exile

233
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,517
Island.

234
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,644
They will stay there until the

235
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,437
next immunity challenge.

236
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,939
Raro, you have one extra member.

237
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,315
Who's sitting this challenge

238
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,191
out?

239
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,192
>> I am.

240
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:46,651
>> PROBST: Stephannie.

241
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,193
All right, we will get you

242
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,694
belted up and we'll get going.

243
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,948
Attached to the belt for Aitu

244
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,824
it is Becky and Candice.

245
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,326
For Raro, Jenny and

246
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:55,618
Cristina.

247
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,578
Here we go, for reward,

248
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,621
survivors ready.

249
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,374
Go.

250
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,586
Both tribes working the rope.

251
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,880
Teamwork critical in this.

252
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,923
>> Go Raro, looking good.

253
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,133
>> I got slack, I got slack.

254
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:11,801
>> PROBST: Easy to get confused

255
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,012
in this maze of rope.

256
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,389
>> Good job, good job.

257
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,390
>> Go under.

258
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:17,765
>> And under.

259
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,558
>> Go through the hole.

260
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,726
>> Go, go, go.

261
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,644
>> PROBST: Aitu with a bit of a

262
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,728
lead.

263
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,439
>> Dig. Dig it.

264
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,316
>> Hole, hole.

265
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,818
>> PROBST: Raro moving on to the

266
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,945
log dig.

267
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,572
All the guys working hard to

268
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,739
dig out that sand.

269
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,244
Yul pulls Becky feet first

270
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:38,744
through.

271
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,956
She's stuck under the log.

272
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,374
>> Pull, pull, pull, doesn't

273
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,875
matter, pull.

274
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,751
>> PROBST: Got a face full of

275
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,586
sand.

276
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,089
Jenny goes head first for Raro.

277
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:50,715
>> Pull her out.

278
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,175
>> Pull her!

279
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,844
>> Her foot, her foot.

280
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,304
>> Don't worry about her.

281
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:56,929
Becky, you worry about your job.

282
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,973
>> We're doing great, now go.

283
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,099
>> PROBST: Aitu on to the next

284
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,434
obstacle.

285
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:01,934
Raro's through the log.

286
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,769
We are neck and neck.

287
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,146
>> Come on, baby!

288
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,316
>> PROBST: Both tribes throwing

289

Blankets, pillows, hammock on

291
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:11,861
the line.

292
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,866
>> Let's not kill these girls.

293
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,075
>> We're fine.

294
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,035
We will give her a pillow

295
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,286
tonight.

296
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:22,788
>> PROBST: Aitu moving on to the

next obstacle, still with a bit

298
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,709
of a lead over Raro.

299
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,835
Raro now moving on to the next

300
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,421
obstacle.

301
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,715
Still a tight race.

302
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,467
>> Hold the rope, go up here,

303
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,884

the rope.

316

>> I understand that, but now

317
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,070
it's tangled.

318
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:54,570
>> Slack's not going to do

319
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:54,862
anything.

Costing them time.

Use that wheel.

384
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,061
>> Five is "B", five is "B".

385
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:56,233
>> Cast away-- we're done.

386
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,359
>> We're done.

387
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:57,902
>> PROBST: Aitu thinks they

388
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,195
have it.

389
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,662
Aitu wins reward!

390
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,039
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

391
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,006
Aitu, congratulations.

392
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,467
Pillows, blankets, hammock--

393
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,635
yours.

394
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,427
In addition, you have a

395
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,345
decision to make.

396
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,429
You're sending one person from

397
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,139
Raro to Exile Island.

398
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,349
They'll return in time for

399
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,725
the next immunity challenge.

400
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,768
They will not be exempt from

401
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,852
tribal council.

402
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,354
Who's it going to be?

403
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,607
>> Adam.

404
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,775
>> PROBST: Adam, you're heading

405
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,150
to Exile Island.

406
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,194
>> All right.

407
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,237
>> Good luck.

408
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,904
>> PROBST: Let's go, Adam,

409
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:42,363
boat's waiting.

410
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,167
Aitu, grab your rewards.

411
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,669
Raro, got nothing for you.

412
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,294
Grab your stuff, head on back

413
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,963
to camp.

414
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,113
>> Great job, guys, seriously.

415
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,030
>> We got the blankets.

416
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,074
>> Woo-hoo!

417
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,076
>> I definitely like winning

418
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,369
the last challenge because all

419
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:30,995
of us feel a little threatened

420
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,039
by the brawn on the other team

421
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,124
because they're so beefy, you

422
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,083
know?

423
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,001
>> This is amazing.

424
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,002
>> We came together when it

425
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,420
counted.

426
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:56,979
>> He's the fishing star for

427
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,063
sure.

428
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,483
Ozzy is a mad fisherman.

429
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,568
Caught eight fish or something

430
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,278
and he's out there for more.

431
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,904
Fantastic.

432
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:14,038
>> Oh, my God.

433
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:18,250
>> Nice job, man.

434
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,585
>> Look at this.

435
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,086
>> This a fish market here.

436
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,881
>> This is so great.

437
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:24,340
>> We're going to eat.

438
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,466
>> Wow!

439
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,967
>> I'm proud of you.

440
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,345
>> Today we caught 11 fish, and

441
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,971
I caught nine of them.

442
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,015
>> I keep telling him how proud

443
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,516
I am of him.

444
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,018
>> I'm happy being the sole

445
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,811
provider of this tribe.

446
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,979
I feel that I have the most

447
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,022
power.

448
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,565
If they lose me then they're

449
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,858
going to be losing a lot of

450
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:43,942
strength.

451
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:44,943
>> I think we should call him

452
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,486
Poseidon now or something.

453
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,946
>> Yes, King Neptune.

454
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,697
>> Because he's the god of the

455
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,823
sea, right?

456
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,908
<i>(laughter)</i>

457
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,915
>> Yeah, that was just so

458
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,207
frustrating.

459
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,124
>> Well, you guys, there's a

460
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,042
bright side to this.

461
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,795
We need to be humbled, (a).

462
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,088
We got humbled.

463
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,298
So, hey, no one is going home.

464
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:10,928
>> We were just bummed out that

465
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,970
we lost.

466
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:12,805
We took a lot of pride in

467
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,806
winning.

468
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,973
And then also bummed that Adam

469
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,225
got sent to Exile Island.

470
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,354
Well, let's cook because

471
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,563
nightfall's going to be here in

472
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,856
probably less than an hour.

473
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,662
>> Wait, they have to go on

474
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,329
rocks.

475
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,288
They can't go on wet.

476
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,049
>> J.P. is very demanding, and I

477
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,760
think he does it in a very sly

478
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,554
way where if you're not very

479
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,930
observant, you wouldn't even

480
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:55,848
realize that he's being

481
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:56,974
controlling.

482
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:57,599
But just the way he was sitting

483
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,560
in camp today like all sprawled

484
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,894
out with his back against the

485
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,980
like recliner on the throne and

486
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,064
everybody's just like waiting

487
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,441
on him.

488
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,191
>> Parvati, can you give me the

489
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,317
machete?

490
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,486
>> Where is it?

491
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,446
He's very demanding.

492
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,655
He's like, "Oh, hand me that

493
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,157
machete, hand me this bowl."

494
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,950
You know, "Serve me."

495
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:15,576
I'm like no, that just doesn't

496
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,703
fly with me at all.

497
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,259
>> Yesterday I was cutting a

498
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,302
coconut and they're like, "Nate,

499
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,636
come over here."

500
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,180
I was like, "What?"

501
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,681
Ow.

502
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,224
Oh, it's a crab.

503
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,894
<i>(laughter)</i>

504
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,272
I'm like damn, this nut hurts.

505
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,357
>> That's how I can get close

506
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,567
to guys in the beginning is

507
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,193
just flirting with them.

508
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,653
I mean, you just have to figure

509
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,781
out the best way to infiltrate

510
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,324
the little groups.

511
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,829
>> Really?

512
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,289
>> Yeah, guys are tight.

513
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,332
But, you know, we're tight.

514
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,292
You know that.

515
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,547
You know that.

516
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,548
You don't believe me?

517
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,508
>> I believe you.

518
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,634
>> I know you believe me.

519
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,718
My feelings for Parvati are

520
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,845
that she's a very cool girl.

521
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,346
We click real good.

522
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,598
She's smart, but I can

523
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,849
definitely trust her.

524
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,434
She's definitely like... she's

525
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,061
my ace right now.

526
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,272
I think there definitely could

527
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,525
be some sparks in the future.

528
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,109
But I don't want to find myself

529
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,152
thinking like a dumb-dumb and

530
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:36,031
just... you know, just guys

531
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,615
sometimes, we can't control

532
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,866
ourselves.

533
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,200
They trust me.

534
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,120
>> By the guys, you mean J.P.?

535
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:42,663
He's the one who's calling

536
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,164
shots, he's the one who's

537
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,457
making the decisions.

538
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,750
>> Well, he is because he knows

539
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,709
he has me and he knows he has

540
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,710
the other guys.

541
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,920
>> I just don't like that he is,

542
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:50,671
like, completely in control

543
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,880
right now.

544
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,298
Or thinks he is.

545
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,259
>> But that's how you let the

546
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,635
game play-- let the king think

547
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,761
he's all good and sitting

548
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,846
pretty.

549
00:18:58,929 --> 00:18:59,471
>> Is that your new motto?

550
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,686
>> I do not want to upset J.P.

551
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,062
right now.

552
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:07,688
That would be the last person I

553
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,731
would want on my bad side.

554
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,692
So I'm just going to let the

555
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,610
king sit pretty until something

556
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,988
happens.

557
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,605
>> Sitting in the nest, she's

558
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,690
probably got eggs.

559
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,983
>> Yeah, they got eggs.

560
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,067
>> Let's go look at them.

561
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,068
>> I don't know if she's

562
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:55,986
protecting eggs or she just is

563
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:56,570
tough.

564
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,447
>> I think she's got eggs.

565
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,366
The kid in me want to get some

566
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,076
eggs for everybody.

567
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,286
I don't need it but the kid in

568
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,538
me want to climb the tree.

569
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,040
The kid in me want to get up

570
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,585
there and see if I can do it.

571
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,629
Give me a stick.

572
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,682
>> No eggs.

573
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,892
>> Oh, my God.

574
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,560
>> What?

575
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,687
>> Oh.

576
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,396
Oh, wow!

577
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,357
>> The little chick.

578
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,277
>> Fell out?

579
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,487
>> Oh, man.

580
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,281
Just one?

581
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,658
>> Yeah.

582
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,493
>> Put it back in the nest.

583
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,203
>> Thing can't fly.

584
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,623
>> Oh, man.

585
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,749
Can't put the nest back, you

586
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,375
want to put the nest back?

587
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,710
>> No.

588
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,378
>> It wouldn't work, would it?

589
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,463
>> This thing is newborn, like

590
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,423
today.

591
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,467
Just covered with its... with

592
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,344
its stuff.

593
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,595
I mean, it couldn't hold its

594
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,429
head up.

595
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:04,972
It had been born within 24

596
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,307
hours.

597
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,642
And it's in my hand.

598
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,726
I mean, I wanted to cry.

599
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,435
I felt terrible.

600
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,480
I don't know.

601
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,773
>> We can't put the nest back

602
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,983
up.

603
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,484
>> We can try.

604
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,694
>> Okay, I'm going to put it

605
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,695
back for you.

606
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,612
Sorry.

607
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,447
I am really sorry, I mean it.

608
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,448
Curiosity got the best of me,

609
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,451
birdie.

610
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,328
>> The nest is really fragile.

611
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,955
>> Grab the tree branch.

612
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,623
>> We're sorry, mother.

613
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,624
>> Can you just put it on that

614
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:32,874
branch?

615
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,420
>> Yeah, that's where it was.

616
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,629
>> He's okay.

617
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,674
He's okay.

618
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,883
Forgive us, please.

619
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,634
>> Forgive us.

620
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,969
I'm sorry.

621
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,929
There, secure, okay.

622
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,055
>> Nice.

623
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,265
>> Good job.

624
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,267
>> I'm sorry.

625
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,977
That kid in me just keep wanting

626
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,186
to do this and do that, without

627
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,520
thinking.

628
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,521
And getting in trouble.

629
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,355
I should know better.

630
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,399
Why am I doing the stupid

631
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,358
things for?

632
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,946
I feel really bad.

633
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,613
I'm really humbled.

634
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,202
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

635
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,382
We'll now bring in Adam,

636
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,259
returning from Exile Island.

637
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,595
<i>(applause)</i>

638
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,513
>> Welcome home.

639
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,849
>> Welcome home, brother.

640
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,851
Good to see you.

641
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,061
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

642
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:34,811
ready for today's immunity

643
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,645
challenge?

644
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,438
>> Yes.

645
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,397
>> PROBST: First things first,

646
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,441
Jenny, I'll take back the idol.

647
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,112
Once again, immunity back up

648
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:44,529
for grabs.

649
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,823
On my go, four tribe members

650
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,450
will race to assemble a stretch

651
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,243
of puzzle.

652
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,495
You will then run through the

653
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,371
jungle with the stretcher until

654
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,664
you reach the beach, where you

655
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,540
will find another tribe member

656
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,419
shackled at the top of a mast.

657
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,962
One tribe member will make the

658
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,632
long swim out, climb up a rope

659
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,258
ladder, release their tribe

660
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:05,509
member.

661
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,677
Both will then swim back to the

662
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,347
beach holding on to a life ring.

663
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,889
You will place the rescued

664
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,225
tribemate on the stretcher,

665
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,352
run back to the start where the

666
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,187
three remaining tribe members

667
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,606
must now build a rescue fire.

668
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,983
First tribe to build a fire big

669
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:22,526
enough to burn through their

670
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,528
rope, drop the tribe flag wins

671
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,613
immunity, guaranteed at least

672
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,074
one more day in this game.

673
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,325
Losers, tribal council,

674
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,952
somebody going home tonight.

675
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,912
Make sense?

676
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,372
Rarotonga, you have one extra

677
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,832
member, sitting somebody out.

678
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,999
Cannot sit out the same person

679
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,625
out in back-to-back challenges.

680
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,669
Stephannie sat out last time.

681
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,170
Who's it going to be today?

682
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:42,712
Cristina, take a spot on the

683
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,340
bench.

684
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:45,799
We'll get started.

685
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,513
In the mast for Aitutaki is

686
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,015

00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,267
Parvati.

688
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,434

Go!

694
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:11,700
First step is putting the

695
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,910
stretcher together.

696
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:18,415
It is a puzzle.

697
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,916
>> Yeah this is a match, this

698
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,836
is a match.

699
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,962

00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,664
start on the fire.

763
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,958
>> Go, go.

764
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,167
>> Let's go, guys.

765
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,631
>> PROBST: Raro back.

766
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,717
>> Go!

767
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,884
>> PROBST: Stephannie, Jenny,

768
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,553
Becca start on their fire.

769
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:41,099
Both Aitu and Raro working on

770
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,601
the magnesium.

771
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,812
>> Get the flint going.

772
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,772
>> PROBST: Cao Boi flame for

773
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,566
Aitu.

774
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,277
>> I'm going to burn that.

775
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,194
>> Come on, baby, you're the

776
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,864
man.

777
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,948
>> PROBST: Aitu with a lot

778
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,991
of smoke.

779
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,826
Do they still have flame?

780
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,746
Cao Boi got his own system.

781
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,874
>> Yee-ha.

782
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,877
>> Don't lose it, stay cool.

783
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,128
>> PROBST: Cao Boi's either

784
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,212
going to be a hero or very

785
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,714
silly.

786
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,757
Raro not giving up.

787
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,887
You're still in this.

788
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,722
Somebody got whacked.

789
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,809
Jenny with a bloody hand.

790
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,061
>> Come on, baby.

791
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:26,978
>> PROBST: Whatever Cao Boi was

792
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,189
doing, it's working.

793
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,398
Stephannie trying to get

794
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,193
something going for Raro.

795
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,194
>> Come on.

796
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,445
>> PROBST: Cao Boi with a big

797
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,571
flame now for Aitu.

798
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,739
Can they keep it going?

799
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,116
Raro needs to get fire quickly.

800
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,034
What you're doing isn't

801
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,160
working.

802
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:42,786
>> You guys want to switch off?

803
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,703
>> PROBST: Fire is going for

804
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,122
Aitu.

805
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,665
Raro has nothing.

806
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,544
Immunity on the line.

807
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,630
Tribal council for the losers.

808
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,714
>> It's up to the rope.

809
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,548
>> PROBST: That flame is burning

810
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,674
the rope.

811
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,717
>> Yeah, yeah.

812
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,220
>> PROBST: Becca not giving up.

813
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,097
>> You guys are awesome.

814
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,764
Here it comes.

815
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,308
Watch the flag.

816
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,185
>> PROBST: Aitu wins immunity.

817
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,437
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

818
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,657
Aitu, congratulations.

819
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,199
Once again you worked well

820
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,784
together and it paid off--

821
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,411
immunity.

822
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,414
<i>(cheers)</i>

823
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,581
Raro, not good news for you

824
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,457
guys.

825
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,375
Tribal council tonight.

826
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,543
Somebody from this tribe is

827
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:31,835
going home.

828
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,961
Head on out.

829
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,171
See you at tribal.

830
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,786
>> Well, unfortunately since we

831
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,580
lost our challenge today that

832
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,164
means we're going to tribal

833
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,249
council tonight.

834
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,584
And no one's looking forward

835
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,002
to that.

836
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,962
But it has to be.

837
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,882
Someone has to go home tonight.

838
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,134
>> Keep our heads up, guys.

839
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,804
I don't want to see any frowns.

840
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,972
>> Too bad we went up against a

841
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,725
Zen fire master.

842
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,563
>> I feel like I'm the weakest

843
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,105
link and I'm so angry with

844
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,357
myself about that.

845
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:36,983
Like I should have done better.

846
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,985
I should have struck the flint

847
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,695
harder, stronger, done

848
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,405
something, you know, to make

849
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,324
more of a difference.

850
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,658
>> Just so you know, when Cao

851
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,701
Boi was on our team he was

852
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:47,327
always the one making the fire,

853
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,953
starting the fire, tending to

854
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,288
the fire.

855
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,042
>> Look, guys, I'm the one that

856
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,753
caused us to lose this

857
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:00,381
challenge and I'm probably the

858
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:00,924
weakest link.

859
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,429
>> Steph just came out of the

860
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,639
blue and said, "I'm the

861
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,890
weakest link."

862
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,517
Stephannie and I are real tight.

863
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,227
We got Hikihood love, you

864
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,269
know?

865
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,270
She's one of my Supremes, so

866
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,356
she knows I have her back.

867
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,857
But then I think about it, all

868
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:18,942
these people are out here trying

869
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,027
to play a game and if someone is

870
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,530
doubting themselves this early,

871
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,990
and doesn't want to be here, I'm

872
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,617
not going to keep you here.

873
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:35,875
>> You know, rather than have it

874
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,126
be a surprise to her.

875
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,881
>> Give her some respect.

876
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:42,423
She's given us respect and

877
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,425
helped us out in many ways.

878
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:46,970
>> Exactly.

879
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,012
>> We give her the respect she

880
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:48,888
gave us, you know what I'm

881
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,014
saying?

882
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,302
>> You want to go fetch

883
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,554
coconuts?

884
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,402
>> I know it's important right

885
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,570
now as a tribe to keep the

886
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,195
strong ones in, that we can win

887
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,156
more challenges going forward,

888
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,490
but then again, it's five

889
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,074
women, four men.

890
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,368
So if we're going to do any type

891
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,578
of alliance, it needs to be done

892
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,246
right now, tonight, if any of

893
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,539
the women really want to stay

894
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,665
in the game.

895
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,875
I would love to see us girls

896
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,543
align and take out some of the

897
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,919
guys because the guys are

898
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,962
already starting to align

899
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,505
together and stick together and

900
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,882
they're the stronger ones.

901
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,884
>> So why don't we switch this

902
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,509
up and just have all the girls

903
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,345
align right now and get rid of

904
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,429
J.P.

905
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,263
>> That's what I said.

906
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,640
Women should stick together.

907
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,390
>> All right, I'm cool with

908
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,224
that.

909
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,392
I'm not ready to go home.

910
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:16,976
>> Girl, I'm not either.

911
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,437
>> Uh-uh.

912
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,624
>> Right. I can't believe I set

913
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,293
myself up like that.

914
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,378
I just should have kept it to

915
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,880
myself.

916
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:46,964
It was just a moment of

917
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:47,256
frustration.

918
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,133
I'm not giving up.

919
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,677
I don't want that perception

920
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,220
hanging over my head.

921
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,054
>> Hello.

922
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,222
>> Hello.

923
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,809
>> All right.

924
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,358
>> How?

925
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,361
>> Us girls come together.

926
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,278
Are you up for it?

927
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,363
>> I'd be up for it.

928
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,491
>> Yeah.

929
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,742
>> Is she?

930
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,374
>> I really don't trust him,

931
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,667
I don't.

932
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,226
>> Honestly, I think...

933
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,814
>> We need you guys.

934
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,398
I need you.

935
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,743
>> I don't completely trust

936
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,744
Brad.

937
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,038
I trust him to a certain degree.

938
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,372
So whatever Brad chooses to do

939
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,333
today, I hope it's for the good

940
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,834
of our tribe and not just for

941
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,419
himself.

942
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,568
>> PROBST: Nate, how are you

943
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,194
feeling in general in this game

944
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,154
right now?

945
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:15,696
>> You know, we've only been

946
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,239
together three, four days.

947
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,824
So we're all still feeling the

948
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,157
waters.

949
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,284
I'm not breaking out of my

950
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,869
shell yet because it could bite

951
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,079
me in the butt.

952
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,497
If you become too powerful,

953
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,248
too assertive in the beginning,

954
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,416
the rest of them will just eat

955
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,960
you up.

956
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,044
>> PROBST: Jenny, is there a

957
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:31,379
leader on this tribe?

958
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,423
>> Not-- not really.

959
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,299
>> PROBST: And what does that

960
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,385
mean, "No, not really?" as if

961
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,511
there was something underneath

962
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,303
that.

963
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,346
>> You're putting me on the

964
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,348
spot, aren't you?

965
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,474
>> PROBST: It's tribal council,

966
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,517
it's a game for a million

967
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,434
dollars.

968
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,227
I'm trying to figure out what's

969
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,270
going on.

970
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,187
>> All right, J.P., don't hate

971
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,273
me, but J.P. likes to take

972
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,109
command a lot.

973
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,861
>> PROBST: So J.P., when Jenny

974
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,320
says "Sorry, don't be mad at

975
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,446
me..."

976
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,531
>> I have no problem with her

977
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,991
saying that whatsoever.

978
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,659
I mean, I don't say, "Hey, you

979
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,828
got to go fish, you got to..."

980
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,204
Matter of fact, there's times

981
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,747
I go, "I'm taking a nap."

982
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,207
You know, so, maybe I voice a

983
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:08,749
couple more things, maybe we

984
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,876
should do things.

985
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,960
But I don't tell anybody how or

986
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,045
when.

987
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:13,629
>> PROBST: Rebecca, why was it

988
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,298
you, Jenny and Steph that were

989
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,383
deemed the fire makers for this

990
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,301
challenge?

991
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,094
>> Because we were all really

992
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,178
confident going in, in terms of

993
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:21,470
making fire.

994
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,222
We've all started fires on a

995
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,849
daily basis.

996
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,767
And unfortunately, I just

997
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,896
couldn't get the right spark.

998
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:30,521
>> PROBST: Stephannie, would it

999
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,273
be fair to vote one of the

1000
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,524
three of you off tonight simply

1001
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,818
because you didn't get it done?

1002
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,861
>> I would say no, it wouldn't

1003
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,195
be fair.

1004
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,238
It could have been any one of

1005
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,531
us up there trying to make that

1006
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,532
fire.

1007
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,658
But that's not what you want

1008
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,826
to consider.

1009
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,952
If you're going to vote someone

1010
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,162
off, you should consider the

1011
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,622
big picture.

1012
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,581
>> PROBST: J.P., while

1013
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,707
Stephannie was talking, you

1014
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,750
were nodding completely in

1015
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,001
agreement.

1016
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,044
>> Yeah, I mean, okay, I'll

1017
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:53,669
put myself out there-- I got my

1018
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,420
butt kicked on the swimming

1019
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,338
today.

1020
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,214
There was no reason for them to

1021
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,299
vote me off today.

1022
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,258
So I agree with Stephannie 100%,

1023
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,302
it doesn't go according to the

1024
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,720
challenge.

1025
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,014
It's not fair.

1026
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,140
>> PROBST: Brad, is it too early

1027
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:08,893
to ask if there is a philosophy

1028
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,228
that you bring to how you play

1029
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,437
this game?

1030
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,314
>> Trust is a foundation of

1031
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,440
everything.

1032
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,483
For me at this point in time, I

1033
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,818
always like to use the term "go

1034
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,654
with your gut," and 95% of the

1035
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,365
time my gut's always right.

1036
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,574
>> PROBST: Parvati, do you trust

1037
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,575
everybody in this tribe at this

1038
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,955
point?

1039
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,164
>> For the most part, I do

1040
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,540
trust everyone in this tribe.

1041
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,833
>> PROBST: How about you,

1042
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,335
Stephannie?

1043
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,586
>> No, I don't trust everyone

1044
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,295
in the tribe.

1045
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,297
But I do feel comfortable

1046
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,632
enough to share certain things

1047
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,217
with all of our tribe members,

1048
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,176
yes.

1049
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:42,760
So there is a certain level of

1050
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,344
trust that I have.

1051
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,680
But to completely trust?

1052
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,889
This is a game, and I can never

1053
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,724
do that.

1054
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,892
>> PROBST: Rebecca, when you go

1055
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,268
back to camp tonight, will you

1056
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,478
be able to let this vote go

1057
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,521
easily?

1058
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,523
>> It won't be easy but it's

1059
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,024
something that has to be done

1060
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,651
so that we can all move on and

1061
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,277
move forward and get stronger

1062
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:00,861
so that we don't have to come

1063
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,239
back here again.

1064
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:03,864
>> PROBST: J.P., you're shaking

1065
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,199
your head.

1066
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:05,825
You're dreading this?

1067
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,284
>> Yeah, I've already told

1068
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:07,910
myself this will probably be my

1069
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,288
hardest vote in this game.

1070
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,540
>> PROBST: Okay, now that Exile

1071
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,332
Island has come into play, the

1072
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,543
hidden immunity idol could come

1073
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,627
up.

1074
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,045
If it gets played, you present

1075
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:18,546
it to me after the vote.

1076
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,673
It is time to vote.

1077
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,507
Stephannie, you're up.

1078
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,477
>> Sorry, J.P.

1079
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:47,658
It was either you or me.

1080
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,909
>> I wish you didn't voice that

1081
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,369
point of weakness, but you are

1082
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,746
a wonderful and beautiful

1083
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,080
person and you'll be with me

1084
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,915
the rest of this game.

1085
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,009
>> J.P., I know you had your

1086
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:05,593
game face on and none of us

1087
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,470
wanted to be played.

1088
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,971
Good luck.

1089
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,273
>> Your wish is my command.

1090
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:42,630
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1091
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,215
votes.

1092
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,641
Once the votes are read the

1093
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,810
decision is final.

1094
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:56,727
The person voted out will be

1095
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,478
asked to leave the tribal

1096
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:57,978
council area immediately.

1097
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,773
I'll read the votes.

1098
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:06,904
First vote, Stephannie.

1099
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,115
J.P.

1100
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,745
Stephannie.

1101
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,996
Two votes Stephannie, one vote

1102
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,456
J.P.

1103
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,751
J.P.

1104
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,211
We're tied-- two votes J.P.,

1105
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,671
two votes Stephannie.

1106
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,259
J.P.

1107
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:28,759
That's three votes J.P.,

1108
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:33,305
two votes Stephannie.

1109
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,807
J.P.

1110
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,058
That's four votes J.P.,

1111
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,852
two votes Stephannie.

1112
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,941
Fourth person voted out of

1113
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:44,775
the Cook Islands...

1114
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,818
>> Wow.

1115
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:46,735
>> PROBST: ...J.P.

1116
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,736
That's five, that's enough.

1117
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,571
Unless you have the hidden

1118
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,738
immunity idol, you need to

1119
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,865
bring me your torch.

1120
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,991
>> Holy crap.

1121
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:52,908
Damn, you guys outwitted me big

1122
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,285
time.

1123
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,168
>> PROBST: J.P., the tribe has

1124
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,627
spoken.

1125
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,020
>> PROBST: Well, you just voted

1126
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:21,687
out someone who appeared to be

1127
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,481
one of the strongest members of

1128
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:24,773
this tribe.

1129
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,901
He obviously did not see it

1130
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:27,985
coming.

1131
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,236
I'm hoping this means you have

1132
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,696
a plan on how to get this tribe

1133
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,781
better together to start

1134
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,033
winning some challenges.

1135
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,284
Grab your torches, go back to

1136
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,744
camp, good night.

1137
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,259
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for

1138
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,053
scenes from our next episode.

1139
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,682
>> PROBST: Next time on

1140
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,267
<i>Survivor:</i>

1141
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,477
>> Today's a good day to be

1142
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,478
just relaxing.

1143
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,437
>> PROBST: Cao Boi fumes

1144
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,563
over the women's work ethic.

1145
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,358
>> Sundra, Candice, Becky

1146
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:07,775
they don't even try.

1147
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,611
They will be eliminated.

1148
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,571
>> What you guys doing here?

1149
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,614
>> PROBST: And Raro gets

1150
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,782
unexpected company.

1151
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,824
>> I don't think they should be

1152
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,784
on our island.

1153
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:17,826
This is our turf.

1160
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,625
>> Wow, this is something I

1161
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,627
never, ever saw coming.

1162
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,962
It takes more than just being

1163
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:28,587
strong and big and physical and

1164
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,756
thinking you're mentally tough.

1165
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,883
You got to really watch your

1166
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,759
back.

1167
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,677
There's no hard feelings,

1168
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,178
that's the way the game is

1169
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,346
played, and man, they really

1170
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,722
pulled one over on me.

1171
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,890
You definitely can't trust

1172
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,808
anybody in this game, there's

1173
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,684
no way.
