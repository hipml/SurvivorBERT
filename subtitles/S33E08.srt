1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
to help us. We're going to

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,840
help you. We're going to help

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,640
you. We're going to help you.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,680
Previously on survivor at the

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,240
Tocali tried. Adam betrayed

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,320
Taylor. I lied to you and I

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,920
screwed you. Figgy was the

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,880
sacrifice that had to happen

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,760
at the venue a tribe. David

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,400
and Zeke were growing closer.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,000
Zeke. I trust you a lot. I

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,200
think we're cut from the same

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,760
cloth at the Ikeboola tribe.

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,960
We're going to make a big

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,400
move. This decision could

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,600
honestly mold the rest of my

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,600
game. A tribal council, Jay

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,080
and Will voted with the Gen Xers.

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,080
Seventh person voted out.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Michaela sending Michaela home.

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Michaela tribe spoken.

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,840
Leaving Hannah in the dark.

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,840
13 or less who will be voted

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,360
out tonight?

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,360
That was hard man. I know it

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,360
was really hard. Yep. She was

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
mad man. I told you dude. Yeah

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
I never seen anything like

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
that. I made a big ass move

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
tonight and I thought I was

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
going to get punched in the

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
face honestly. But Michaela is

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
the closer. She closed on

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
every single challenge. So I

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
needed to do this pre merge

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
just to be safe and pretty

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
proud of myself right now. I

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
appreciate you guys keeping us

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
around you know. Thank you

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Hannah too. I want to thank you

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Hannah. I know. You kept your

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
little girl out. We didn't want

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
her to be dirty. You know I

44
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
would have voted with you all

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
though. I know but I didn't

46
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
want you to do that. I know I

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,360
just wanted you to know that

48
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,360
I. Yeah. At this point I'm

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
clearly at the bottom of this

50
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,360
whole thing. I'm not going to

51
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,360
vote with you guys. I'm not

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
going to vote with you guys. I

53
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,360
can't trust any of these people

54
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,360
being completely excluded from

55
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
a vote is a sure fire way to

56
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360
break trust and create enemies.

57
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,360
J thinks I'm just pathetic

58
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
idiot that can't see past his

59
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
pretty face and intense

60
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
gameplay. You have to trust

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
me. I promise you I will tell

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
you. You gotta tell me I don't

63
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
care about my hands getting

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
bloody. I just want to know

65
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
what the vote is. OK do. I

66
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
hope I can get my freaking

67
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
revenge. I'm ready to play.

68
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,360
I see it here. Watching or

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
waiting to see what it is. It's

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
coming in this direction. What

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
do they want. What is happening.

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
All right everybody settle down.

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
What's going on. What's going

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
on. Thank you sir. All right.

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Let's go. Everyone gather

76
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
around. Gather you around. Gather

77
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
you around. He could pull a

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
tribe. You have five minutes to

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
gather all supplies you will

80
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
need to survive for the rest of

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
this game. Get on this boat.

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
That was music to my ears. I

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
went from terrified that I was

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
going home to now I'm at the

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
merge within 24 hours. I can't

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
tell you how awesome that feels.

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Oh yeah. Hammer. Now the whole

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
game is just opening up for me.

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Jay's word has been true so far

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
so maybe I could trust Will and

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Jay. But yet I know I still have

92
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Chris and I want to see what

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,360
he's been working on. We're not

94
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,360
staying here. Nope. We're going.

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I made the merge. To get to this

96
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
point means so much. It really

97
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
means the world. But this is

98
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
when things start to get really

99
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
serious like this is the point

100
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
of the game where alliances and

101
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
loyalties are really tested and

102
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
the really great players get

103
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
separated from the mediocre

104
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
players. And I hope that I'm in

105
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:16,360
the former group.

106
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Hey, hey, look. Oh my God.

107
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm so stoked. You know, I was

108
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
down on the bottom for so many

109
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
days. I didn't know that I was

110
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
going to make the merge. And here

111
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
I am. Clouds have cleared and

112
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm thrilled. I'm a little

113
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
nervous because who knows who

114
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
has made what connections at

115
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
their other beaches. But for now

116
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,360
I'm just excited to be here.

117
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,360
We're back together. Thank God.

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
It's the merge. This is

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
gigantic to be back with the

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
people that you originally

121
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
trusted and that you want to

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,360
work with is huge. And Jay and

123
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Taylor, those are the

124
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
relationships that I could take

125
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
to the end. So I'm back in the

126
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
game.

127
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
This place, huh?

128
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Fingers. I got a wrist.

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Shall we? Yeah.

130
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
We shall.

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Congratulations. You have made

132
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,360
the merge.

133
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,360
So let's eat.

134
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
What, someone?

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Oh yes, cheers.

136
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm super excited because I'm

137
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
back with Michelle and I got

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Taylor's back. Oh my God. But

139
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
then I also got in my pocket, I

140
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
got Will and Hannah and I'm

141
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
pretty sure Bret and Sunday.

142
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Besides that, I got an idol in

143
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
my back pocket. So I'm the

144
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
kingpin, but no one knows. And

145
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I want to keep it that way.

146
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Do we want to go around and

147
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
just say what we, where we come

148
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
from, our age, what we do?

149
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,360
My name's Taylor and I'm 24

150
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
years old and I'm a snowboard

151
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
instructor. Seeing everyone

152
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
together, I have no idea who I

153
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
can really trust and who I

154
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
cannot. I still truly trust

155
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Chris and Sunday the most.

156
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
I'm Sunday. I'm older than all

157
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
of you. And then I thought I

158
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
might be able to trust Jay. But

159
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
I saw some millennials kind of

160
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
coming together laughing, all

161
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
joking and you know, it got me

162
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
a little nervous. So I don't

163
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,360
know, man. We'll see.

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Good to see you, brother. Oh my

165
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
God, Bret.

166
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
David and I've been like,

167
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
how are we going to get Bret

168
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
and Sunday back over, man?

169
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
We'll get Bret and Sunday

170
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
rolling in good shape.

171
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Oh yeah.

172
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Of course, many things have

173
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
happened, but...

174
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Yeah.

175
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
I haven't decided if the merge

176
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
is going to be a good thing or

177
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
a bad thing for me. Everything

178
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
was going really well at Vanua

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
and we were on a roll. But the

180
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
fact that there was two tribes

181
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
and then a swap and then now

182
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
we're back into this 13 and

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
trying to figure out their

184
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
relationships is extremely

185
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
difficult.

186
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
We need to think this through

187
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
though.

188
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Dave, Zeke and myself are

189
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
meshing pretty well. That's a

190
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
pretty good core group right

191
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
there to work with. And then I

192
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
want to regroup with Bret

193
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
and Sunday and figure out what

194
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
the next move is.

195
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Hey guys.

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Congratulations on none of us

197
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
being voted out.

198
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Yeah, exactly.

199
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
I am delighted to see my old

200
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,360
nerdy pals, Hannah and Adam.

201
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
You know, it's almost good that

202
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
we got split up, right?

203
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Because I have intel from

204
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Vanua, Adam has intel from

205
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Takali and Hannah is tapped in

206
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
on the intel from Jay at

207
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Ikebuluk.

208
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
So I go to travel council and I

209
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
write down Bret's name and

210
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Makayla writes down Bret's

211
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,360
name. And then everyone flips

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
on the two of us.

213
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Really?

214
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
Led by...

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Jay?

216
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Having my nerd voting block, I

217
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
should be feeling great. But

218
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Jay worries me. He's the locus

219
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
of power right now because Jay

220
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
is very charming. He looks at

221
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360
you with those deep brown eyes

222
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
and he smiles his surfer smile

223
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
and it's very enchanting.

224
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Dude, I almost had you on that.

225
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
And it's making me nervous to

226
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
see all of like the dudes, you

227
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
know, Ken and Chris and Tay,

228
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
everyone sort of getting taken

229
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
in by this Jay charm.

230
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
How you doing?

231
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Good, man. Good to meet you.

232
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Good to meet you.

233
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
For real?

234
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Yeah.

235
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
He sort of has this like mystique

236
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
about him that everyone is drawn

237
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
towards. He controls Will

238
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
outright. He probably controls

239
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Michelle.

240
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
You surf?

241
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Yeah. I used to live in Newport

242
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Beach.

243
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Beautiful man.

244
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
And I'm just like, if this bro

245
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
lions happens, I'm in trouble.

246
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Dude, we got like a buried chest

247
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
of awesome things.

248
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
When we first got here, I was

249
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
nervous that there wouldn't be

250
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
enough food.

251
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
There we go.

252
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
And, uh...

253
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Way more, I thought.

254
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Yeah, way more.

255
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,360
My philosophy here is that

256
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
having a belly belly is

257
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
the best way to get

258
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
the most out of your body.

259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
But it's not just about the

260
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
belly, it's about the

261
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
body and the body.

262
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
It's about the body.

263
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
It's about the body.

264
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
My philosophy here is that

265
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
having a merge feast, it's

266
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
nice, it's fun, I like to eat,

267
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
but do I need it?

268
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
No.

269
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
And almost every merge in

270
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Survivor, there's going to be

271
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
a merge idol out here

272
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
somewhere.

273
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
And I know this camp well.

274
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
I was the only person that's

275
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
been able to find an idol

276
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
here.

277
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
So if there is an idol out

278
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
here, I feel like I may have

279
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
a good chance to actually

280
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,360
find something.

281
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
I take a look at Tremail,

282
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I look up, and there's a note.

283
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
I grab it, I open it up,

284
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
but there's no idol.

285
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
So I'm like, what's going on

286
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
here?

287
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Oh!

288
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Whoa.

289
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Congratulations.

290
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
You have found an advantage

291
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
that allows you to steal a

292
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,360
reward after it has been won

293
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
by someone else.

294
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
But wow.

295
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
I know everything about this

296
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
game, and this is certainly

297
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
a first.

298
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
And it's exciting to be a part

299
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
of Survivor history, to have

300
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
a new power that nobody has

301
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
ever had in this game before.

302
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Alert Jeff of your intention

303
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
to steal after he has presented

304
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
the reward to the winners and

305
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
before they leave the

306
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
challenge area.

307
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
I think I'm in one of the best

308
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
positions in this game, and I

309
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
have an idol.

310
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
And so I'm going to sit on

311
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
this and use this on something

312
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,360
that really matters.

313
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:07,360
music

314
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
I wake up in the middle of the

315
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
night and I get this idea.

316
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I'm like, I'm pretty good with

317
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
mason jars and canning stuff.

318
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
So I pull a classic Survivor

319
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
move.

320
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
I grab a mason jar.

321
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
I put so much stuff in there.

322
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
I was just like, I'm going to

323
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
try to eat as much of that as I

324
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
possibly can.

325
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,360
That's my stash.

326
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
music

327
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
In the middle of the night, I

328
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
hear clanging.

329
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
I look out and the kids

330
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
grabbing dried bananas.

331
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
That's our food for the week.

332
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
This is 13 people living out

333
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
here.

334
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
You don't just jump in and

335
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
start divvying up food

336
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
for yourself.

337
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Well, I don't want to be the

338
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
one to say anything, so I go

339
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
back to bed.

340
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,360
music

341
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,360
music

342
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
I wake up in the middle of

343
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
the night and I see Taylor

344
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
sneaking some food, so I

345
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
decided it's an opportunity to

346
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
build trust with them.

347
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm going to have a midnight

348
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,360
bro down and talk some game.

349
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
music

350
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
You cannot tell anyone about

351
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
this, bro.

352
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
If I tell anyone about this,

353
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
just vote my ass out.

354
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Okay.

355
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
I'm not even hungry, so you

356
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
go down.

357
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Okay.

358
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
I know your history.

359
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
That figure is gone.

360
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
And that's like, mm-hmm,

361
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
totally understandable.

362
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Taylor is an incredibly

363
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
unlikely ally for me.

364
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
I have voted against his

365
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
girlfriend twice and actually

366
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
voted her out.

367
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
But if I can convince him to

368
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
vote my way, then I've got

369
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
control of this game.

370
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
music

371
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Jay is building an arm.

372
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Yeah.

373
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
And Will has become Jay's

374
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
right hand man.

375
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Yeah.

376
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
They're tighter, honestly,

377
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
than you and him have

378
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
maybe ever been.

379
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I hate the idea of holding

380
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
out a millennial first.

381
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Yeah, yeah.

382
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
But what if we voted

383
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
off someone like Will?

384
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
music

385
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
What if we voted out Will?

386
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,360
So if you take out Will,

387
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
then he has no choice but

388
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
to go back to you.

389
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,360
This is number one.

390
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Holy crap.

391
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Adam's trying to get Will out.

392
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Are you dumb?

393
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Like, I couldn't believe it.

394
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I don't want to work with Adam.

395
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
He wrote my woman's name down,

396
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
but Adam thinks that we are

397
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
very buddy-buddy,

398
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
and I want to keep it that way.

399
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Can I tell you a secret?

400
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Sure.

401
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,360
I was looking for an idol today,

402
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,360
and I found an advantage.

403
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Okay.

404
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
It's never been done before.

405
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,360
It says that at any point,

406
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,360
I can steal someone's reward.

407
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Reward?

408
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Yeah.

409
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
So if someone wins or

410
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
lost his or her money,

411
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,360
I say, bro,

412
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
I'm taking this reward.

413
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm hilarious, dude.

414
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
The only reason I'm telling you this

415
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
is because I want you to know

416
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,360
that I'm serious about working with you.

417
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
I want to, like, run this thing.

418
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
That could not have been easier.

419
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
I get all this intel from Adam.

420
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Like, I didn't really have to do anything.

421
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,360
I am a fan of the survivor revenge,

422
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,360
and so I want to blindside Adam

423
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
as best as possible.

424
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
That is gonna be epic, dude.

425
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
It's freaking epic.

426
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Ha-ha-ha.

That's if somebody needed it

433
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
in the middle of the night.

434
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
At night, we went to bed,

435
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,360
the mangoes had not been touched.

436
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
I woke up,

437
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
and there was maybe, like,

438
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
a quarter to a third back in the jar.

439
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
And it's tailing.

440
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
It doesn't make any sense to me.

441
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,360
That world is gonna be styling, you know?

442
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
I think we're getting bamboozled.

Tick of thieves.

447
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
I know.

448
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
I'm starting to think that we've underestimated

449
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
the Millennials' hold on each other

450
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
and their actual bond.

451
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I see a tight group over there,

452
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
so I'm thinking we have to get

453
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,360
one of them gone or we're in trouble.

454
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
We have no match.

455
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
We have all kinds of people.

456
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Are you sure?

457
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Well, let's think about it.

458
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,360
You, Sunday, me, David, Z,

459
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
which one?

460
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Jesse, Ken, Seven.

461
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Yeah, he's ready to bounce.

462
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Nobody's pissed at David.

463
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Yeah.

464
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Maybe it's dumb.

465
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Yeah.

467
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
The tightest bonds in this game

468
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,360
are J with David, J with Michelle,

469
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
and then Will.

470
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah, I agree.

471
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Not only are they unbreakably tight,

472
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
but they're also dangerous players.

473
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
So you guys are good with Taylor, right?

474
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Great.

475
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
That would be, like, sweet.

476
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Already, people are floating around the name Taylor.

477
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
It seems like we're all on board with it,

478
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
but it's so early,

479
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360

480
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
where everybody is trying to carve out

481
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
a path to Final Tribal,

482
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
so there's going to be a ton of scrambling.

483
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
People are going to start to get unsure,

484
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,360

489
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
will you vote out Millennials?

490
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Me?

491
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
I said we keep them strong for right now.

492
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
OK.

493
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360

494
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
is I know Gen Xers,

495

they're going to target me and you.

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Like, where does Will stand at this point?

503
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Will's good.

504
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360

and he's like,

528
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
we need to talk.

529
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
And he's like,

530
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
dude, Adam's gunning for Will.

531
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360

532
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
what the hell is going on?

533
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Why is he going for Will right now?

534
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
I said, dummy.

535
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Because he's convinced

536
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
that he's your right-hand man.

537
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Will's my right-hand man?

538
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Yeah.

539
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
So that means he's gunning for me?

540
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Eventually, yes.

541
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
And so then it makes me think, OK,

542
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
is it less of a risk

543
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,360
to just get out Adam right now?

544
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
That's going to come out of left field.

545
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Yeah, it is, and it's going to surprise him.

546
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,360
LAUGHS

547
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I just heard Jay and Taylor

548
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
discussing getting rid of Adam.

549
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
And I'm just like,

550
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
oh, my God, like, this is not good.

551
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
But if Adam gets spooked,

552
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
this is going to blow up.

553
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Yeah.

554
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
We just need to get Will on board.

555
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Yeah.

556
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Right now, Jay and his quarterie

557
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
are the most dangerous.

558
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
So I was hoping to get this kind of, like,

559
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
nerd alliance together.

560
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
But if Adam gets voted out,

561
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,360
it'll throw a wrench into my beautifully laid plan.

562
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
It's going to get so crazy right now.

563
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
There's names being tossed out left and right.

564
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Yeah. Have you heard mine?

565
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Yes.

566
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
You have? From who?

567
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Adam.

568
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Because he knows that he's in the same position

569
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
as he was when we left this camp.

570
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Yep.

571
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Adam's the rat, and we need to get him out.

572
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
But now I'm freaking out because

573
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,360
if he can get the numbers, I'm screwed.

574
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
So I'm starting to think to myself,

575
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:59,360
I have to win immunity.

576
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Come on and go.

577
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
All right, you guys ready to get to

578
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,360
your first individual immunity challenge?

579
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Yes.

580
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,360
First things first, take back tribal immunity.

581
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Thank you, David. Thank you, Zig.

582
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,360
Tribal immunity, no more.

583
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Individual immunity is now what you covet.

584
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Oh, yeah.

585
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,360
With this around your neck, you are safe at tribal.

586
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Cannot be voted out.

587
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Without it, you're in trouble.

588
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
For today's challenge, you're going to balance

589
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
on a narrow perch.

590
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Your hands will be tethered to a bucket above you.

591
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,360
When your arms drop, you're out of the challenge.

592
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Last person left standing wins immunity.

593
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Safe from the vote, losers, you know the drill.

594
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Tribal council, somebody will be the eighth person

595
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
voted out of this game.

596
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Take your spots. We'll get started.

597
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,360
All right, everybody in position.

598
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:29,360
This challenge is on.

599
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,360
It's a blast from the past that has been updated.

600
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
It's a survivor classic.

601
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
We used to do it with one arm.

602
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,360
That wasn't tough enough.

603
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,360
So we decided to make it a little tougher for you guys.

604
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,360
Both arms above your head.

605
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,360
There really is very little wiggle room.

606
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,360
If your arms drop just a little, that will be enough

607
00:20:52,360 --> 00:21:02,360
to tip your bucket, and you'll be out of the challenge.

608
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Sunday is the first move.

609
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Sunday, first out of the challenge.

610
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
No shot at immunity.

611
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,360
Now you have an idea how sensitive it is.

612
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Not much wiggle room, right?

613
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Nothing.

614
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Chris drops.

615
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Chris is the second person out of the challenge.

616
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Brett drops right behind Chris.

617
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Brett is now out.

618
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Your challenges are made to test.

619
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:50,360
How far can you dig right now to stay in this?

620
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Come on, my shoulder.

621
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Oh, my God.

622
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Ow.

623
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
Okay.

624
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
You're a lot of grunting and groaning.

625
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Oh, man.

626
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
You're not crazy.

627
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
You're not weak.

628
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
You're not a good designer.

629
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
God.

630
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
This was improved to make it very tough.

631
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Come on.

632
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Jay had been struggling for a while.

633
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Groaning at the pain, Jay drops out.

634
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Zeke falls off right behind Jay.

635
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Zeke is out of the challenge.

636
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,360
We are down to eight.

637
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,360
David has been moving a lot, but his arms are staying steady.

638
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Where are you feeling it, Adam?

639
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Nowhere, Jeff.

640
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Where are you feeling it, Jessica?

641
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
I'm good, Jeff.

642
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
I'll be honest where I'm feeling it.

643
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
No one else was honest to you.

644
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,360
I feel it in my arms and my back and my face and my legs and my toes.

645
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
You feel it in your face.

646
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
I feel it everywhere.

647
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,360
It's like pain everywhere.

648
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,360
Ken, the slightest bit of movement, and his bucket drops.

649
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
That's how fast it goes.

650
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
My palms are going numb.

651
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:14,360
You start daydreaming about something else, and you're drenched.

652
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Hannah can't take it anymore.

653
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Her bucket drops.

654
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Hannah now will take a spot on the bench.

655
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
No shot at immunity.

656
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:39,360
We are down to Taylor, Adam, David, Jessica, Michelle, and Will.

657
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Everybody trying to put on a big game face.

658
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,360
You don't want anybody to know that you're hurting, that you're close to falling,

659
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,360
because they might just be a little closer.

660
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,360
So whatever you have in that tank, you need it now.

661
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Oh, Michelle.

662
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Michelle is out of the challenge, and we are now down to five.

663
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,360
This is about proving to yourself what you can do.

664
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,360
Win push.

665
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Taylor is now out, and we are down to four left.

666
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:32,360
David can't hold on any longer, and that leaves us with three.

667
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Adam drops out.

668
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
We are down to two now.

669
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Jessica and Will, one Gen Xer, one Millennial, fighting for immunity.

670
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
How are you feeling, Jessica?

671
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
I'm feeling fine.

672
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
How are you, Will?

673
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm doing amazing.

674
00:24:51,360 --> 00:25:14,360
It would be so nice to go to tribal with that necklace, certain that you aren't going home.

675
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,360
You've reached the one hour mark.

676
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Good job, guys.

677
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Nice work.

678
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Good job, guys.

679
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Jessica, what would your kids say right now?

680
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,360
My kids are going to be damn proud of their mom.

681
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Yeah.

682
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Yeah.

683
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,360
I've always told them they can do anything.

684
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Anything.

685
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
My mom told me the same thing.

686
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
You have a good mom.

687
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
Yeah.

688
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Now I'm here to prove it.

689
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Oh, man.

690
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:57,360
I'm going to go another hour.

691
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
This is crazy.

692
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Insane.

693
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
That's incredible.

694
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Can't be much feeling left in your arms, hands, fingers.

695
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,360
And every time you try to loosen them or get some feeling back, you know you're risking

696
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
tipping that bucket.

697
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,360
But you've got to do it to get the feeling back.

698
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Oh, well.

699
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Whoa.

700
00:26:37,360 --> 00:27:01,360
After an hour and 30 minutes, Jessica drops Will the high schooler wins first individual

701
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,360
immunity.

702
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
Whoa.

703
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Nice job.

704
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Wow.

705
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
What a performance.

706
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Good job.

707
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:15,360
I knew I needed it, so I just kept pushing for it.

708
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Will, come on over.

709
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Nice job, Will.

710
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,360
First individual immunity goes to Will.

711
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Congratulations.

712
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,360
I don't know what your friends back home in high school are doing right now, but it definitely

713
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
isn't this.

714
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,360
You are safe tonight as for the rest of you.

715
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,360
After 23 days, your quest for a million dollars for one of you, it will fall short.

716
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Tribal council tonight, somebody will be the eighth person voted out of this game.

717
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
It will not be you.

718
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you tonight at tribal.

719
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Congrats.

720
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Good job.

721
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Unbelievable.

722
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,360
My plan totally just blew up in my face, and I got to give him credit.

723
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
Will needed to win today, and he did.

724
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,360
And so now I need to try to figure out another plan.

725
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Well, you are unbelievable, man.

726
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
I don't know how you did that.

727
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Incredible.

728
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
That was amazing to watch, dude.

729
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,360
It was incredible.

730
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Nice job, man.

731
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Thank you.

732
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I can't believe that I, the youngest person to ever play this game, won the first immunity

733
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
challenge.

734
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,360
And what makes it even better is that I needed this one, because I know that Adam had planned

735
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
to try to vote me out of this game.

736
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
So he has to go.

737
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,360
I said we take out Adam.

738
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,360
I know it's all on you, but he was going for Will.

739
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,360
You was calling me out, but you was calling Jay.

740
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Yeah, but he doesn't have numbers to do anything.

741
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
That's crazy.

742
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Think about it.

743
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
And you still want him?

744
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
Whatever you want.

745
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
I vote Adam.

746
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,360
I know it's uncomfortable, but we have to do it.

747
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,360
We get back, and almost immediately, Jay turns around and says, we're voting Adam out tonight.

748
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
And my immediate reaction is, what?

749
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
That's stupid.

750
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,360
We have all these other people who would be great to go home.

751
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
I'm with you.

752
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
We've been since the beginning.

753
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,360
It seems like more of a personal move than a strategic move, and I'm really worried we're

754
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
making a huge mistake.

755
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Hey, buddy.

756
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,360
I got some news for you.

757
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Before we went to the challenge, Taylor told Jay that you had been planning to vote out

758
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Will.

759
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
That's why Will knew.

760
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Yeah.

761
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
Because I know I'm a target.

762
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
I knew it.

763
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,360
As soon as he was up there for like three hours, I was like, the kid knows what went wrong.

764
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Yeah.

765
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Damn it.

766
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,360
I'd laid the groundwork for what I thought was a solid plan, and then the day of tribal

767
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
council, it all unravels.

768
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,360
So you are now Jay's target, but I think we can pull the votes together to get out Taylor.

769
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Taylor, why would you do that?

770
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
I had a feeling I might be playing too hard.

771
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,360
I was playing too hard, and now I have to scramble.

772
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,360
And at this point, I'm willing to work with anybody on this tribe if it'll keep me in

773
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,360
this game.

774
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,360
I'm sorry I'm coming to you like right before tribal council, but...

775
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Well, we're saying Taylor.

776
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Whatever name you want.

777
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
That's what I'm putting down.

778
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
But we're saying Taylor.

779
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
I'm a little wary he has an idol.

780
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
I think Jay has the idol.

781
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Well, he could give it to Taylor.

782
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Right.

783
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,360
What needs to be broken up is the upper echelon of the Millennials, and that's Jay, Michelle,

784
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
and Taylor.

785
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,360
It's just a question of getting everybody on the same page, because in the back of our

786
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,360
minds, we're thinking, well, there are idols out there, right?

787
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Here's what I think.

788
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Michelle is the safest person to go after, because she does not have an idol, and they

789
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
won't see it coming.

790
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
She definitely doesn't have one.

791
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Exactly.

792
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
You hear that, Ken?

793
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Are you all right with that?

794
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,360
We need to go after Taylor.

795
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
We've got to make a decision, guys.

796
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,360
I need Zeke and the Gen X-ers to get through this tribal council, but they're back and

797
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,360
forth on who to vote for, and if they can't get it together, then I need my plan B, which

798
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,360
is to see if I can get Taylor to target somebody else.

799
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Jay won't look me in the eyes.

800
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
We shouldn't have done that, dude.

801
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Because it was too soon, and then information leaks.

802
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
So what do I do?

803
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
I swear I'm with you.

804
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,360
At this point, Adam has a good idea that his name's been dropped, so he's scrambling,

805
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
but it's too late, man.

806
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,360
I will write anyone's name down at this point.

807
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Tonight is 100% about revenge.

808
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,360
Adam's responsible for Figgy going home.

809
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,360
So now we're in the merge and I got my boys back.

810
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
We're coming to beat you up.

811
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
That's a weird scenario we play tonight.

812
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
He doesn't have an eye on us.

813
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
I know he does not know.

814
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
He's scrambling too much.

815
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
It's so odd.

816
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
It's like all these conversations that are happening.

817
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Like when Adam walks off with Taylor.

818
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,360
You don't think Adam would flip on us, do you?

819
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,360
We were going to try to save Adam, but I don't know if we could trust him.

820
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,360
The paranoia sets in in the panic and that little seed of doubt can grow into a gigantic forest of doubt.

821
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
I'm really nervous.

822
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,360
Adam, if you freak out too much and pull too many people aside, the vote will get screwed up.

823
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,360
You know what I mean?

824
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Okay.

825
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
I trust you.

826
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
I just don't know if I can trust them.

827
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,360
I will check in with those people, but if you keep pulling people aside, that's what's going to get you in trouble.

828
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Okay.

829
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
Okay?

830
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Adam's name is being thrown out there hardcore, and I knew this was going to happen because Adam decided

831
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
he couldn't just play with the weirdos.

832
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
He had to sit at the cool kids table.

833
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,360
I know Adam was on our team, but he's the worst teammate ever.

834
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Yes, Adam needs to go very soon.

835
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Adam is not trustworthy.

836
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Adam is a bad alliance member.

837
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,360
I've been hoping to preserve my sort of like nerd voting block,

838
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,360
but Adam is the most frustrating person to work with because I don't know what he's up to.

839
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,360
So now I'm thinking we should just vote him out.

840
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Hannah's telling me that I just need to relax and that everything is going to be okay.

841
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,360
But I know for a fact that my position in this game is very tenuous.

842
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
I don't think Adam's breathing.

843
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
I'm just happy he's awake.

844
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
I see his super-ass face change.

845
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
I'm not happy.

846
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,360
Now the good news is I have the hidden immunity idol,

847
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,360
so I could play it and know that I'm still going to be here tomorrow.

848
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,360
But if I use it and I had the numbers, I look like a chump.

849
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,360
Oh, I don't know what to do.

850
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,360
So the Millennials and Gen X together, this is what you wait for.

851
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,360
David, what are some of the differences you've noticed between the Millennials and the Gen Xers?

852
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,360
I feel like the Millennials eat a lot more food than the Gen Xers.

853
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,360
Our feast food has been wiped out.

854
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Some pineapples and melons, and that's about it.

855
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,360
And Brett, David is clearly saying the Gen Xers didn't eat it.

856
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,360
Yeah, it was Taylor.

857
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
But really I wasn't keeping it a secret.

858
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
No, he wasn't keeping it a secret, Jeff.

859
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
You were open that you're stealing it.

860
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Yeah, yeah. Well, I don't even think I was stealing it. My stomach was super messed up.

861
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Let me just do a quick poll.

862
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
Chris, how hungry are you right now?

863
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
I'm pretty hungry, Jeff.

864
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Jessica, hungry?

865
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Absolutely.

866
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
Hannah?

867
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
I could eat you.

868
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,360
So Taylor, clearly the point is everyone's hungry.

869
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,360
Oh, yeah. Oh, definitely.

870
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Chris, is this a difference between the Millennials and Gen X?

871
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Even when it's clear everyone is calling him out, he's still smiling.

872
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Glenn, I know. It's kind of cool.

873
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Where I'm from, when you do something that you're thinking of yourself, it's called selfishness.

874
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,360
That's a selfish move. Let's not get that confused with gameplay.

875
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
To clarify, it's not that I was hungry.

876
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,360
If I wake up and my stomach is freaking out, then yes, I'm going to do whatever I have to do.

877
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
So you're saying this was a medical emergency.

878
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
Exactly, Jeff.

879
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,360
Jeff, we all had medical emergencies that night.

880
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Some of us are still having medical emergencies.

881
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,360
And where are our banana chips to help stop Buster?

882
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,360
I mean, in a game for a million dollars, you have to practice a little delayed gratification.

883
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,360
Because it might cost you a million dollars down the line.

884
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,360
And yet, Hannah, I don't even have to ask Taylor.

885
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,360
I can tell by his demeanor he's not the least bit concerned that he's on the block tonight.

886
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Yeah, he's a chill bro.

887
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Rock on, dude.

888
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,360
All right, so Adam, what is the vibe with a group of millennials and Gen Xers,

889
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,360
the majority of millennials, but you're all playing this individual game?

890
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,360
It's not just a majority millennial.

891
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Yeah, there may be some loyalties from those first 12 days,

892
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,360
but there was also a period where we were in three different tribes getting to know each other really well.

893
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,360
And you can build loyalty during that time as well.

894
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,360
David, Adam brings up an interesting point.

895
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,360
When you switch tribes, it forces new relationships, and then it makes you question your old ones.

896
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,360
How much impact have the switches had?

897
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,360
Yeah, you know, I mean, the phase of the game that we're in right now, it's simply this.

898
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,360
It's the people I trust versus the people you trust.

899
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,360
And so it doesn't really matter whether you're a millennial or a Gen Xer.

900
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,360
That's just secondary to, really, who do you trust?

901
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Jay, does that ring true to you that it really isn't Millennials versus Gen X anymore?

902
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,360
Yeah, I had a tribal with Will a couple of tribals ago, and he said,

903
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,360
when you find someone that's loyal or trustworthy, you latch on to that.

904
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,360
So I'm going to stick by that.

905
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:25,360
But Michelle, that's what every person who's had their torch snuffed thought or said right before they got it snuffed.

906
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,360
Makayla just did it. Viggy never saw it coming. The list will go on and on.

907
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
I'm going to agree with Jay and Will on this.

908
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:38,360
You know, sometimes I wonder if it's just the person that you mesh with best, someone that you just feel more friendly with.

909
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:46,360
So, Will, what's your take on tonight's vote? Is it going to be about a very clear objective or is it something else?

910
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:52,360
There is definitely a clear objective in everybody's mind. The question is, what is the prevailing objective?

911
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Chris, how many objectives do you think are out there?

912
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Well, I'd say there's probably 13, but I think there will be some lines drawn in the sand tonight. That's my perspective on it.

913
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Michelle, you are nodding your head.

914
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:13,360
I definitely see a line drawn tonight. That means that trust will be broken for some people and strengthened with others.

915
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,360
So, Taylor, still not worried about tonight's vote?

916
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,360
No, no. I don't think worrying does anything. Some people are worried all the time.

917
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,360
There's nothing you can do at this point to change the fate of that.

918
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,360
Why are you smiling, Adam?

919
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,360
Because he looks right at me when he said it. So, you tell me. Does that say something?

920
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,360
How nervous are you right now, really?

921
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Very.

922
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Because you've heard your name?

923
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,360
Yeah. And it's terrifying. Nobody wants to be the first person voted out at the merge.

924
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:52,360
I mean, this is a big milestone. To make it here is an incredible accomplishment, but this is where the fun begins.

925
00:38:52,360 --> 00:39:16,360
All right. Time to vote. David, you're up.

926
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:33,360
This one's for Viggs.

927
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:43,360
I have never been able to trust you.

928
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:53,360
I'll go tally the votes.

929
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:06,360
If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.

930
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:15,360
Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out to be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes.

931
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,360
First vote. Adam.

932
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Michelle.

933
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,360
Adam.

934
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Michelle. We're tied. Two votes Michelle, two votes Adam.

935
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,360
Adam. That's three votes Adam.

936
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:42,360
Michelle. We're tied again. Three votes Michelle, three votes Adam.

937
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Adam. That's four votes Adam.

938
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:54,360
Michelle. Tied again. Four votes Michelle, four votes Adam.

939
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Michelle. That's five votes Michelle, four votes Adam.

940
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Michelle. That's six votes Michelle.

941
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Eighth person voted out, the first member of our jury, Michelle. Seven, that's enough. Need to bring me your torch.

942
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Michelle, the tribe has spoken.

943
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:40,360
Time for you to go.

944
00:41:40,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Well, anytime there are lines drawn in the sand, the question is, will they be there in the morning or will the tides of Fiji wash them away? Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night.

945
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

946
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,360
Next time on Survivor.

947
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:27,360
The battle lines have been drawn. You and Will and Taylor are all on the bottom. They're gone in my way. But Taylor can't keep a secret. I'm not going to leak that to anyone. He can steal someone's reward.

948
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,360
I'm going to put a massive target on his back. Dude that will ruin his game.

949
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:53,360
Oh man, well I think, I think they didn't trust me or Jay or you know a group of us and I thought that the majority of people were with us. I thought I could lay back and trust what people had said. So I maybe went overboard with my, my laying back.
