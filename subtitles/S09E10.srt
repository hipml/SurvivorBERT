Go on.

>> PROBST: Has it been nice

196
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,393
having a little company at camp?

197
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:34,811
>> Not when you're

198
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,603
hungry, and you want meat.

199
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,397
(<i> laughter</i> )

200

>> Yes.

205
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,903
>> Sure thing.

206
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:44,737
>> PROBST: For today's

207
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,404
challenge,

208
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,531
you will be randomly divided

209
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,698
into two tribes of four.

210
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,491
You'll compete in this obstacle

211
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,700
course.

212
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,952
One person will be your

213
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:51,828
sacrificial lamb.

214
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,662
They will be attached to a rope

215
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,206
which runs the entire length of

216
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,332
this obstacle course.

217
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,333
They will also have their hands

218
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,251
tied.

219
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,877
So the other three tribe members

220
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,546
will be responsible for getting

221
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,381
them through all five stages of

222
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:03,881
the course.

223
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,674
For the first stage, you'll go

224
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,343
up and over a three-level fence.

225
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,719
You'll then maneuver through a

226
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,096
series of hitching posts.

227
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,097
You'll then climb up and over a

228
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,889
wall.

229
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,598
You will then dig under a log.

230
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,851
And then finally, you will

231
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,852
maneuver through a vertical rope

232
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,811
maze.

233
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,104
First tribe to get all four of

234
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,313

tam-tam wins reward.

236
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,315
You want to know what you're

237
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:21,732
playing for?

238
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,358
>> Yes.

239
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:22,775

243
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,404
another island for an overnight

244
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:26,654
visit...

245
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,405
>> Yes!

246

>> PROBST: ...where you will be

247
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,031
hosted by a village.

248
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,408
This will be an amazing,

249
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,868
once-in-a-lifetime experience

250
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,493
with a tribe who lives very

251
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,745
differently from you.

252
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,581
You'll be treated to all kinds

253
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,040
of cultural activities,

254
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,584
including a major feast.

255
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,752
>> Oh, wow!

256
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,378
>> Oh!

257
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,337

266
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,220
All right, for the two groups,

00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,537
>> God, oh, and wait for it to

768
00:20:47,621 --> 00:21:05,347
go away.

769
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,432
>> I had one hell of a night.

770
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,811
It rained cats and dogs, and our

771
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,186
shelter just...

772
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,314
it just poured in.

773
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,857
Our blankets were drenched.

774
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,441
Our clothes were drenched.

775
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,526
Our pillows are drenched,

776
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,611
everything.

777
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,779
And the timing was just right,

778
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,197
and I said, "You know what,

779
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,490
you guys, keeping this fire

780
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,408
going... I tell you what.

781
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,867
We ought to, uh, send Eliza on

782
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,203
home and, uh, and, uh, keep

783
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,371
these guys around another few

784
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,288
days.

785
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,164
Let 'em help us with the fire

786
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,916
and collecting wood."

787
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,792
Then...

788
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:40,924
the game changes.

789
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,720
>> ♪ Hallelujah!

790
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,471
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

791
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,473
Hallelujah! ♪

792
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,395
>> Yeah, you know, her

793
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,147
time's definitely overdue.

794
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,605
>> Thank you.

795
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,149
>> Five on that.

796
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,150
>> She should've...

797
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:58,400
You all...

798
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,151
I don't know how you

799
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,152
all kept her as long as you did.

800
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:00,777
I don't know.

801
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,236
>> Yeah, I don't...

802
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,238
>> So, you want to tell Ami?

803
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,948
>> Oh, we can tell Ami. No.

804
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:05,490
>> I think so.

805
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,658
>> I think Ami's cool

806
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,909
with it, but...

807
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,910
Yeah, the guys don't need to

808
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,327
know.

809
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,871
>> Listen, here's their...

810
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,538
The guys will vote with us,

811
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,041
because here's their choice.

812
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,792
>> "Don't vote with us,

813
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,501
and one of you guys are going

814
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,210
home tonight."

815
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:17,753
>> "Eliza, or one of you.

816
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,171
Take your pick."

817
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:25,177
>> That's true.

818
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,094
>> Want to hit the trail

819
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,137
mix first?

820
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,804
>> Yes.

821
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,264
>> There's no fire.

822
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:29,890
I'll start on it.

823
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:30,390
Is that cool?

824
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,183
>> Yeah, yeah.

825
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:31,892
>> You guys want to

826
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,310
coconut it up?

827
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,186
>> We'll coconut...

828
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,980
>> Hey.

829
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,776
Home sweet home.

830
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,401
>> Did it rain on you guys?

831
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,028
>> Oh, yeah, it rained

832
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:43,320
off and on.

833
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,946
>> But-but you were inside.

834
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,739
>> Um, we ended up in a

835
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,115
hut at the end of the night that

836
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:47,532
didn't ra...

837
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,868
that didn't, um... leak.

838
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,911
>> But the food and the

839
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,412
sleeping arrangements,

840
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,581
seriously, were horrible.

841
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,582
>> Swear to God.

842
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,458
>> But you didn't have to

843
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,834
sleep with wet blankets, and you

844
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,045
didn't get poured on, right?

845
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:00,545
>> We did not get poured

846
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,464
>> At least there's that.

847
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,007
>> When-when we got back,

848
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,092
it was as if...

849
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:05,550
they couldn't be

850
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,469
less excited to see us.

851
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,971
>> It was nice to be around

852
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:10,222
the kids.

853
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:10,806
That my favorite, favorite,

854
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,141
favorite, favorite part.

855
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,059
And all I could see was the sea

856
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,394
of little kids' faces all around

857
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,394
the fire-- this little tiny

858
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:16,686
fire.

859
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,021
We were all hunched down.

860
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:18,939
I was sitting down on the ground

861
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:19,898
like this.

862
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,440
They were all hunched all

863
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:20,982
around, and I could feel a

864
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,526
little kid's head on my head.

865
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:22,943
I loved that part.

866
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,738
>> Mm-hmm.

867
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,531
>> Very interesting.

868
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,158
Coming back to camp, there was

869
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:30,826
no welcome.

870
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,369
Just could care a less.

871
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:32,994
"Whatever, you had a good time,

872
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,371
whatever, yadda, yad.

873
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,622
Sit down and do your work or

874
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,207
whatever you need to do."

875
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,208
It's pretty much how the welcome

876
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:38,583
went.

877
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,918
But I could definitely tell

878
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,753
something had gone on.

879
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,880
I had really weird feelings.

880
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,256
Jules didn't...

881
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:44,631
wouldn't look me

882
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,050
in the face, would not look me

883
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:47,884
in the face, which makes me

884
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,593
think, "Oh, God, what

885
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,720
conversations have been going on

886
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,390
while I haven't been here?"

887
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,349
>> You want to hear about

888
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,642
the whole plan?

889
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,060
>> Yes, I'd love to.

890
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,436
>> You want to hear the

891
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:58,728
whole plan?

892
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,106
All right, Jules, Leann, Twila,

893
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,691
myself-- we all want to get rid

894
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,526
of Liza.

895
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,485
Like having a rattlesnake in

896
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,529
your pocket.

897
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,613
>> Mm-hmm.

898
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,698
>> So, we got to keep

899
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,450
Liza from getting immunity,

900
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,327
anybody get immunity but Liza,

901
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,371
and vote Liza off, and then from

902
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,581
there, we got to get rid of Ami

903
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,832
immediately.

904
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,583
We've got to get Ami out,

905
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,543
because she is...

906
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,586
>> The brains.

907
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,712
>> And we'll play ball

908
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,921
with you guys, 'cause we think

909
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:25,922
it will be a lot more fun.

910
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:26,923
>> It would.

911
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,924
It will be.

912
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,301
>> We just really love

913
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,343
you guys.

914
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,469
I'm just thrilled.

915
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,596
>> I'm not going to make

916
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,305
this obvious,

917
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,472
I'm going to head back with

918
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:34,723
my wood.

919
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,724
Yeah, things have changed.

920
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,726
There's dissension in the ranks.

921
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,686
The women are not tight, and the

922
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,562
women come across cocky,

923
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,564
confident.

924
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,192
They have since the merge,

925
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,526
since Rory went home, and it

926
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,987
got to Scout the way the other

927
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,572
girls were coming across-- you

928
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,990
know, the cocky way Ami presents

929
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:52,699
herself.

930
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,202
Me and Chad, we're doing our

931
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:55,744
best.

932
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,953
We're playing it.

933
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,039
We're tugging at their hearts.

934
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,582
They are rolling in it.

935
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,791
Scout bit.

936
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,251
You question a woman's

937
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,711
character, you question a

938
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,712
woman's ability, she'll snap

939
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,547
your neck.

940
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,633
You open up your heart, show a

941
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,676
woman you're vulnerable, then

942
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,094
they start thinking with their

943
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:13,762
heart.

944
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,222
That's when they open up that

945
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,223
back door.

946
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,224
That's what's happened this

947
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:17,807
time.

948
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,569
>> PROBST: Morning.

949
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,696
>> Morning, Jeff.

950
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,325
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

951
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,576
to today's challenge?

952
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,702
>> Sure thing.

953
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,120
>> PROBST: First things first.

954
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,580
Ami, give it up.

955
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,085
Immunity-- back up for grabs.

956
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,753
For today's challenge, you're

957
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,588
going to climb up a ladder that

958
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,548
is leaning against a post.

959
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,509
On my go, you'll step off of the

960
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,511
ladder, reach out, grab onto the

961
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,471
post and hang on for as long as

962
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:56,805
you can.

963
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,182
When your feet touch the ground,

964
00:25:59,266 --> 00:25:59,766
you're out of the challenge.

965
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,018
Last person left hanging on the

966
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,728
post wins immunity, safe from

967
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,730
the vote.

968
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,148
We've randomly drawn for your

969
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,233
positions.

970
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,235
Take your spot, wait for my go.

971
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,998
For immunity.

972
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,999
Three, two, one, everybody step

973
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,042
up.

974
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,008
And we are on.

975
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,645
Ami loses a little bit of a

976
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,440
grip.

977
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,903
Twila starting to slide, trying

978
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,697
to find a new footing.

979
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,906
She's got it.

980
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,414
Julie's sliding.

981
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,668
Julie coming down another notch,

982
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,462
finds a bit of rope to put her

983
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,422
feet on.

984
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,136
Twila just bear-hugging it,

985
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,347
trying to find a way to grip it.

986
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,900
Julie first one out.

987
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,902
Have a seat on the pole.

988
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,160
Ami starting to slip.

989
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,871
Holding on with her fingertips.

990
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,207
Chris starting to slide.

991
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,792
Chris is out.

992
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,591
Scout starting to slide.

993
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,635
Scout is out.

994
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,471
Scout joins Chris and Julie.

995
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,857
Ami sliding down.

996
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,527
That can't feel good.

997
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:15,860
Ami's out.

998
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,196
Take a spot on the pole.

999
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,865
Eliza starting to slide.

1000
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,909
>> Oh, God!

1001
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,327
>> PROBST: Ooh!

1002
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,537
You all right?

1003
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:25,787
>> Yeah.

1004
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,623
>> PROBST: We are down to three.

1005
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:28,998
Immunity at stake.

1006
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,251
Tribal council tonight.

1007
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,795
Twila biting the rope, going to

1008
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:37,173
hold on with her teeth.

1009
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:37,924
Chad starting to show signs of

1010
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:38,842
slipping.

1011
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,677
>> You're doing good,

1012
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,803
Chad.

1013
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,971
>> PROBST: Chad struggling to

1014
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,138
hang

1015
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,348
on, gripping with his thighs.

1016
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:45,932
Twila still chewing on that

1017
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,976
rope.

1018
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,854
Leann slides, finds a new

1019
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,522
foothold.

1020
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,110
Twila trying to climb back up.

1021
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,778
Every time you move, you risk

1022
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,988
falling more.

1023
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,949
Chad sliding down a little more.

1024
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:07,287
Leann is struggling.

1025
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,872
She's sliding, she's fighting

1026
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,873
it.

1027
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,335
Leann's out.

1028
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,005
We are down to two-- Chad,

1029
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,465
Twila.

1030
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,806
Chad gripping with his fingers

1031
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,685
on that rope.

1032
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,899
And Chad is slipping.

1033
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,066
>> Go Chad, go down,

1034
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,567
Chad.

1035
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,735
>> PROBST: Chad's slipping,

1036
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,986
looking for something to get a

1037
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,112
foot on.

1038
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,947
The last bit of rope.

1039
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,658
>> Go down, Chad, go.

1040
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,910
Go down, Chad.

1041
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,914
Go down, Chad, go down, Chad.

1042
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,958
Please, God, go down, Chad.

1043
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,960
>> PROBST: Chad is out.

1044
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,879
Twila wins immunity.

1045
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,882
>> Yes!

1046
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,555
>> PROBST: Nice work.

1047
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,139
All right, Twila, turn around

1048
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,474
here.

1049
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,683
I know you want this.

1050
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:10,892
>> Yes.

1051
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,852
JEFF: Feels good?

1052
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,978
>> Yes.

1053
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,480
>> PROBST: Safe from the vote

1054
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:15,855
tonight.

1055
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,565
Everybody else on the block.

1056
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,608
You'll vote somebody out and

1057
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,234
have another member of our jury.

1058
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:19,901
I'll see you there.

1059
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,445
Get your stuff and head back to

1060
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:22,820
camp.

1061
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,697
>> Thanks, man.

1062
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,003
>> So, are we voting for

1063
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,213
Chad tonight?

1064
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,006
>> I think there's a way

1065
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,966
that, you know, if we were to

1066
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,510
give the guys longer in the

1067
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,595
game, I think there's a way we

1068
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,097
could go ahead and send Liza

1069
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,264
home.

1070
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,808
You just have to spend one night

1071
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,434
sitting in a downpouring rain

1072
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,270
trying to keep a fire going to

1073
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,271
appreciate...

1074
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,063
>> I sat out here by myself

1075
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,315
one night and kept the fire

1076
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,108
going all night.

1077
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,109
I'm willing to do fire duty with

1078
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,193
you.

1079
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,903
It just scares me to think that

1080
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,405
one of the girls would be going

1081
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,114
home before the guys.

1082
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,705
>> You and Jules and

1083
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,706
Leann, you're such strong

1084
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,708
competitors.

1085
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,880
>> I think we got most of

1086
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,257
the big rocks.

1087
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,431
Scout and I were definitely at

1088
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,932
odds about how the vote should

1089
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:33,683
go.

1090
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,976
She really wants to get rid of

1091
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,686
Eliza, but I thought getting rid

1092
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,062
of Eliza tonight was not a good

1093
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,355
idea at all.

1094
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,940
Let's kind of stick to the game

1095
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,567
plan, and not have to worry

1096
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,068
later that there's two strong

1097
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,069
men that could win immunity, and

1098
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,447
we're going to have to start

1099
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,656
voting out women.

1100
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,949
One of these guys can make it

1101
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,159
all the way to the end.

1102
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,327
This game is not over.

1103
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,245
So are we for sure voting Chad

1104
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,456
tonight?

1105
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,957
>> I'm still up in the

1106
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,208
air right now.

1107
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:09,427
>> I think that's a good idea.

1108
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,553
Don't you think?

1109
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,679
>> Yeah.

1110
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,764
>> I don't know.

1111
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,140
>> It was just making me

1112
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,224
excited the other way.

1113
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,225
>> I know.

1114
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,769
>> Everyone excited.

1115
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,187
>> Going to Tribal Council

1116
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,188
for me is just let's get it

1117
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:20,938
done.

1118
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,315
Let's take care of the vote,

1119
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,066
let's get home, let's work on

1120
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,777
tonight and hopefully start out

1121
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,654
with a nice, dry day tomorrow.

1122
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:28,196
I don't think it's time for

1123
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,281
Eliza to be voted off yet.

1124
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,075
I just don't.

1125
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,298
>> After getting back from

1126
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,675
the challenge, everybody's mood

1127
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,301
seemed to be a little different.

1128
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,428
I just sensed that Scout was not

1129
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,263
getting the results from the

1130
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,099
other women to vote for Eliza.

1131
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,308
Gotta hydrate; big night around

1132
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,519
the fire tonight.

1133
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,896
At this point, I'm just going to

1134
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,022
try to reassure those in ourg to

1135
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,066
voting bloc, which is what I

1136
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,235
think is our voting bloc, to

1137
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,903
keep with the same vote that we

1138
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:10,238
had planned.

1139
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,781
So, it's still the same vote

1140
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,532
tonight, right?

1141
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,783
Has everything changed?

1142
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,283
>> I have no idea what's

1143
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,159
going on.

1144
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,078
>> Are you kidding me?

1145
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,121
>> No, ma'am, sir.

1146
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,706
I thought you said they talked

1147
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,123
to you.

1148
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,291
>> Who, Chris?

1149
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,085
>> No, uh... Scout.

1150
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,670
>> Well, she's been saying

1151
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,254
stuff for, you know, the last

1152
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,048
few days, and everything looks

1153
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,092
good, but just from what Ami

1154
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,469
and, uh, just from what, the way

1155
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,470
that they're acting, man, it

1156
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,222
just doesn't look good for me.

1157
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:39,225
>> Here you go.

1158
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,853
I want to get out of the rain.

1159
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:42,979
I'm about half dry.

1160
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,021
>> Man, it is up in the

1161
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:44,647
air right now, and there's some

1162
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,149
last-minute fierce negotiation.

1163
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,900
Twila has immunity tonight, so

1164
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,569
there's no reason she shouldn't

1165
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,321
vote with us.

1166
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,243
>> Honey, don't ask me.

1167
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,204
I'm not the person to ask.

1168
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,290
I'm certainly not the person to

1169
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,624
ask.

1170
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,127
>> There's only one person

1171
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,254
that's made...

1172
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,964
>> So I'm pissed.

1173
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,048
>> Are you?

1174
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:11,591
Well, we are, too.

1175
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,467
>> You friggin' pissed me off.

1176
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,676
>> Really?

1177
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,677
>> Well, I've been wanting to

1178
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,470
get rid of her since day one.

1179
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:15,803
>> We have an...

1180
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,429
>> But it don't matter to me.

1181
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,263
I told... I told Ami, "Whatever

1182
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,974
you all decide, come back and

1183
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:21,017
let me know," 'cause it don't

1184
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,350
matter to me.

1185
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,351
I just don't like the bitch.

1186
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,352
>> I know.

1187
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,353
>> I didn't like her from day,

1188
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,354
and I want to get rid of her.

1189
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:25,646
>> I know.

1190
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,439
>> But...

1191
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:26,647
>> Yeah.

1192
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,566
>> It's drama central today.

1193
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,860
(<i> Leann laughs</i> )

1194
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,570
It is friggin' soap opera-ville.

1195
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,572
>> Yep.

1196
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,160
>> Scout?

1197
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,161
>> Yeah?

1198
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,204
>> You know you got Ami

1199
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,790
asking all kinds of questions.

1200
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,291
She don't want to vote for

1201
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:45,750
Eliza.

1202
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,293
She wants to go ahead and vote

1203
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:47,710
one of the guys out.

1204
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,462
She thinks it's stupid to vote

1205
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,880
for one of the women when you

1206
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,381
still got two guys that can win

1207
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,257
immunity, and she's right.

1208
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,217
I don't know.

1209
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,968
I feel like I'm being pulled

1210
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,969
from both directions.

1211
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:57,553
I'm being pulled, because you

1212
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,305
feel like you're fifth, so you

1213
00:34:59,388 --> 00:34:59,931
want me to go with you, and I'm

1214
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,767
feeling like they're...

1215
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,684
I don't know if I can trust them

1216
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,977
or not, and I'm going, "You

1217
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,020
know, I don't know what to do

1218
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,396
here," but they're not going to

1219
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,689
vote for Eliza.

1220
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,690
I'm telling you right now, them

1221
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,274
four...

1222
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,275
It's going to be four against

1223
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,193
four.

1224
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,194
>> All right, will you...

1225
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,195
will you let me talk and listen

1226
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:14,862
to the logic?

1227
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:15,863
>> You gonna have to hurry,

1228
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,739
'cause I got to go that a'way.

1229
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,740
>> The logic is, is that

1230
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,075
we have, with the two guys and

1231
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,284
you and me, we have four votes

1232
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,410
to their three votes.

1233
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,411
>> But that's not going

1234
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,162
to happen, though.

1235
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,163
They're not going to do it, and

1236
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,164
somebody's going to have to draw

1237
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,290
a rock tonight and go home.

1238
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,625
Would you like to be out of this

1239
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,919
game by a friggin' stone?

1240
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,087
Well, I wouldn't.

1241
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,088
>> All right, so... so what

1242
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,756
what you're going to...

1243
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,382
>> I'm not going to do

1244
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,299
nothing yet.

1245
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,092
I'm still thinking.

1246
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:36,717
I'm aggravated, but I have to go

1247
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,637
this way.

1248
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:50,606
I definitely feel stuck in the

1249
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,108
middle right now, and it's

1250
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:52,942
tearing me up, 'cause I don't

1251
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:53,651
know.

1252
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,652
You know, it's like I'm going to

1253
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,362
get somebody pissed off at me

1254
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,656
either way, so I'm screwed.

1255
00:35:58,739 --> 00:35:59,282
The guys are depending on me and

1256
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,199
Scout to pull through for them.

1257
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,993
That's the only way they're

1258
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,702
going to stay in the game.

1259
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,412
I don't know which way to go.

1260
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,247
You know, I'd really...

1261
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,331
Yes, I'm like Scout.

1262
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:07,915
Yes, I'd like the hands to be

1263
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,709
turned and Ami not be in charge

1264
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,170
right now, but I don't know if

1265
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,296
that's going to happen.

1266
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,316
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1267
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,485
the first member of our jury,

1268
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,571
Sarge, voted out at the last

1269
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,363
Tribal Council.

1270
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,281
He is here merely to observe and

1271
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,618
gather information.

1272
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,161
Big change in the weather last

1273
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,245
few days.

1274
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,455
A lot more water.

1275
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,372
Rain coming down.

1276
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,082
Everybody here seems to be cold.

1277
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,250
Leann, does that change anything

1278
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,793
at this point in the game?

1279
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,253
>> Um, I'm not good with

1280
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,755
the rain.

1281
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,756
I'm worried that I'm just going

1282
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,967
to... freak out and not be able

1283
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,302
to handle it.

1284
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,470
It makes me crazy!

1285
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,429
>> PROBST: Chris, no secret

1286
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,514
there's been talk of the women

1287
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,016
sticking together and picking

1288
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,392
off the men.

1289
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,769
Have you noticed in the last

1290
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,020
couple of days that maybe your

1291
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:11,646
stock and Chad's stock might've

1292
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,480
gone up a little bit?

1293
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,023
>> Absolutely.

1294
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:14,774
It's crossed my mind that, you

1295
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:15,358
know, possibly, our stock, you

1296
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,318
know, did go up because of what

1297
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,694
we can do around camp.

1298
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,404
>> PROBST: Chad, guys have taken

1299
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,489
some knocks.

1300
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,490
You still fighting in this game?

1301
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,408
>> Hell, yeah, we're still

1302
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:24,909
fighting.

1303
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,743
I-I'll tell you.

1304
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,494
Chris and I have come up with

1305
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,287
about 25 or 30 different plans,

1306
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,415
different ways of weaseling out

1307
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,167
of-of this situation we're in.

1308
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,043
>> PROBST: Scout, are you seeing

1309
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,628
scurrying around, or has anybody

1310
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,379
come up to you?

1311
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,090
>> Yes, many people have

1312
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,383
come up, and, uh, we've talked

1313
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,885
quite a bit about different

1314
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,137
strategies and plans to get to

1315
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:45,554
the end of the game.

1316
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,057
>> PROBST: Scout-- and you guys

1317
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,141
tell me if I'm wrong-- do you

1318
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,643
think Chris and Chad are both

1319
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,186
listening, thinking, "Maybe our

1320
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:52,603
plans have worked?"

1321
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,689
>> I think the guys have

1322
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,940
talked to everybody.

1323
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:56,190
>> Not me.

1324
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:56,649
>> Not me.

1325
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,858
>> It's not just me.

1326
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,110
>> And not me.

1327
00:37:59,193 --> 00:37:59,694
>> PROBST: So this is news to

1328
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,444
you?

1329
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:00,945
>> Yeah, and it makes me

1330
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,781
nervous that-that two women

1331
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,991
might be voting with the two

1332
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:05,992
men, and that it will be a

1333
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,076
four-four tie, and that's

1334
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,452
exactly what makes me

1335
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,495
uncomfortable.

1336
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,496
>> PROBST: Do you think you

1337
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,497
might've have missed out on

1338
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,498
something being gone?

1339
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,542
>> Definitely possible, yeah.

1340
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,376
I mean, it's possible that that

1341
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,503
night brought them together in

1342
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,255
such a way that things have

1343
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,756
changed since then.

1344
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,091
>> PROBST: Well, here was my

1345
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:22,925
question.

1346
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,260
Twila, do you think you'll ever

1347
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:24,885
get used to the fact that you

1348
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,930
can never ever feel safe?

1349
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:28,764
>> When it comes right

1350
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,557
down to it, you can't trust

1351
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,474
anybody.

1352
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,475
The most'll be 99.

1353
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,143
9%, but...

1354
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,353
I don't know.

1355
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:34,937
Y-You always have that little

1356
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,772
bit in your mind, "Can I, or can

1357
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,356
I not?"

1358
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,233
>> PROBST: Now, Ami, you have a

1359
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:39,942
smile on your face that's so

1360
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,151
smug.

1361
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,152
>> Yeah, 'cause I think

1362
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,945
that is such bull...

1363
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,613
I don't question that one bit.

1364
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,823
Like, I definitely know that

1365
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,491
there are people I can trust,

1366
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,535
and I know I can be trusted.

1367
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,369
>> PROBST: And we'll find out if

1368
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,370
you're sitting in the final two

1369
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,371
whether you're right or whether

1370
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,039
you're wrong.

1371
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,124
>> Totally, totally.

1372
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:55,583
>> PROBST: All right.

1373
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,959
Okay, it is time to vote.

1374
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:57,585
Twila, you have immunity.

1375
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,462
I'm guessing you're not giving

1376
00:38:59,545 --> 00:38:59,962
that up.

1377
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:00,838
>> No.

1378
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:01,630
>> PROBST: All right, Twila is

1379
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,632
the only person you cannot vote

1380
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,633
for. Everybody else is fair

1381
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:04,842
game.

1382
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,260
It is time to vote.

1383
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,846
Scout, you're up.

1384
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,192
>> Chad, I'm sorry.

1385
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,109
I have to stick true to my

1386
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,445
alliance and my word, and you're

1387
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,739
the next one to go.

1388
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,783
Sorry, bud.

1389
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,456
>> Eliza, you've been on

1390
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,541
the chopping block seems like

1391
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,376
forever, and with this vote, I

1392
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,586
hope that my alliance stays

1393
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,589
strong.

1394
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,932
>> Eliza, I'm voting for

1395
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,892
you because your alliance people

1396
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,020
told me to vote for you.

1397
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,498
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1398
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,040
votes.

1399
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,592
Once the votes are read, the

1400
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,009
decision is final.

1401
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:29,635
Person voted out'll be asked to

1402
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,428
to leave the Tribal Council area

1403
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,847
immediately.

1404
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,974
I'll read the votes.

1405
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,560
First vote...

1406
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,645
Eliza.

1407
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,480
Eliza.

1408
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,483
Two votes Eliza.

1409
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,902
Chad.

1410
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,696
Two votes Eliza, one vote

1411
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,072
Chad.

1412
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,408
Chad.

1413
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,661
Two votes Eliza, two votes Chad.

1414
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:57,663
Chad.

1415
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,706
Three votes Chad, two

1416
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,667
votes Eliza.

1417
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:05,171
Chad.

1418
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,672
That's four votes Chad,

1419
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,966
two votes Eliza.

1420
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:13,637
11th person voted out of

1421
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,266
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu:</i> Chad.

1422
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:17,933
That's five.

1423
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:18,934
That's enough.

1424
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,519
You need to bring me your torch.

1425
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,530
Chad, the tribe has spoken.

1426
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,701
It's time for you to go.

1427
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,007
Well, with only one man, the

1428
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,509
women in this tribe must now

1429
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,219
begin to think, "Hmm, where do I

1430
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,096
fall in the pecking order?"

1431
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,764
And suddenly, that one man could

1432
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,184
become very valuable.

1433
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:00,976
12 days left.

1434
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,810
Gonna be fun.

1435
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,895
Grab your torches.

1436
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,146
Head back to camp.

Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1446
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,043
>> Scout and Twila come

1447
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,962
to me and Chad, wanting to form

1448
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,380
an alliance with us.

1449

1451
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,801
I narced out Scout and Twila.

1452
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,969
>> PROBST: The girls confront

1453
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:35,135
Scout.

1454
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,513
>> It's not Scout's idea.

1455
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,514
That is what I'm trying to tell

1456
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:38,681
you.

>> Ami was the one that

1460
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,691
single-handedly convinced the

1461
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,526
women outside of Scout, Twila,

1462
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,236
Chris and I to change their vote

1463
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,029
from Eliza to me, and I don't

1464
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,197
know how she did it, but she did

1465
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,198
it.

1466
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,157
She used the woman power thing,

1467
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,325
and what can I say?

1468
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,244
I-I'm not sore or sour, but,

1469
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:00,744
damn, you know?

1470
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,205
I wish I could've gone further.
