1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,510
Previously on anytime survivor."

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,140
Over the past 10 years, some of

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,330
"Survivor's" Memorable castaways

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,450
Played the game with honor and Instigate.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,450
in my world, I've always

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,220
Tried to show that good will w Win.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,010
While others relied on ruthless

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,540
Cunning and backstabbing.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm the original villaines of

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,200
"Survivor" And I have to tell

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,540
You I feel like mother teresa

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,760
Right now with these people.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,990
In the historic,

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,370
20th season of "Survivor" 10

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,960
Of the most notorious villains

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,960
Have returned to face 10 of the Greatest heroes.

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,760
Russell has the bag for the Villains!

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,600
The first challenge was a fierce Battle.

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,470
The heroes suffered two Injuries.

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,580
my shoulder.

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,820
my toe is broke.

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,760
But ultimately Prevailed.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,370
Heroes win reward!

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,560
Filled with confidence, the

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,630
Heroes worked well together and Built a solid camp.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,710
I love my tribe.

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,990
We have a good aura.

28
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,000
We have good energy.

29
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,350
But not every hero

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,650
Acted heroically.

31
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,570
J.T. Dipped to the villains'

32
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,090
Playbook and formed conflicting Alliances.

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,020
I'm going to form alliances With everyone I can.

34
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,840
It's going to be a whole

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,840
Different ballgame for me.

36
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,480
At the villains'

37
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,970
Beach boston rob is the only one Who worked.

38
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,670
they don't want to build a Shelter.

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,180
They don't want to try to get a Fire going.

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,980
There's noble here that wants to

41
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,990
Do anything.

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,410
Unbeknownst to rob,

43
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,150
Russell was very busy.

44
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,710
we're going to be better of a

45
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,610
Pair that you can possibly Imagine. I agree.

46
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,810
Up to his old tricks

47
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,920
Making secret deals and daniel And poofortd.

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,610
are russell I definitely feel

49
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,770
Like I am making a deal with the

50
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,970
Devil but I want the devil on my Side.

51
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,520
And coach was making

52
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,810
Gallant advances towards jerri.

53
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,330
jerri and I, we have a little Connection.

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,800
Survivors ready? Go!

55
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,820
come on, heroes!

56
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,050
At the immunity Challenge, 

57
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,540
the heroes opened a Huge lead.

58
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,080
Heroes look like they've been

59
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,620
Paddling together forever!

60
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,980
When they got to the puzzle,

61
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,300
Things changed.

62
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,540
Heroes still trying to figure

63
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,130
Out the first piece of this Puzzle.

64
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,050
maybe just two different Pieces.

65
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,810
Sugar and amanda were

66
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,050
Unable to work together,

67
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,900
Allowing the villains to pull Ahead.

68
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,910
Villains win first immunity Challenge!

69
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,160
At tribal council, the heroes

70
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,030
Unanimously voted to make sugar

71
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,110
Pay for her poor performance at

72
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,050
The challenge.

73
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,510
Sugar, the tribe has spoken.

74
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,550
And now both tribes are facing

75
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,850
Tough questions: Did the heroes

76
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,170
Make the right choice to Strengthen their tribe?

77
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,690
As for the villains, with

78
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,300
Torrential sea storms on the

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,400
Way, will the lack of shelter

80
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,140
Zap their strength and kill any

81
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,920
Chance of futur victories?

82
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,420
Paradise, my ass!

83
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,690
man, this is worse underneath

84
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,100
Here than it is out here.

85
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,500
Pouring down rain, like, five

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,830
People were ready to die.

87
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,310
so cold.

88
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,770
everybody's crying, and I

89
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,160
Can't take it any more.

90
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
The main thing we should be

91
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,660
Doing is trying to make a fire

92
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,120
And trying to get our shelter Good.

93
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,390
Nobody wants to step up and they

94
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,470
Want to sit in the rain night

95
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,490
After night, and it's making me

96
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,620
Physically sick, you know.

97
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,420
unbelievable, man.

98
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,300
I am soaked through and through.

99
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,650
it's like, again, again,

100
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,920
Again I'm on the buffoon tribe. Again.

101
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,820
I was on mar kasich, I was on,

102
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,550
On all-stars and again now.

103
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,800
don't know what I'm going To do.

104
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,120
this is-- this is rough.

105
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,820
People are freaking out.

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,270
I mean, there's a lot of

107
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,310
Complaining last night.

108
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,200
it's going to get worse.

109
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,310
I know, and it's only day Four.

110
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,480
it's all going to come down

111
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,350
To what people got upstairs.

112
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,150
yup.

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,510
That's what rob said.

114
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,660
He said, "Here we go.

115
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,200
It's the beginning."

116
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,610
so here we are on day four on

117
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,040
At least design four, probably

118
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,610
Design five of the shelter.

119
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,110
The first one was the best, and

120
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,720
The strongest and Semi-leak-proof.

121
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,010
And each subsequent shelter gets

122
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,230
Worse and worse and worse, and

123
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,230
Now we're-- we're doing it aga Again.

124
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,380
it's going to come up in the

125
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,590
Back, and it's going to come

126
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,470
Down in the front, right, like a Lean-to.

127
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,490
We're stopping, like, about Three feet.

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,790
I think we should keep it low

129
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,190
Like that, don't you?

130
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,890
I think we should just--

131
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,680
I think we should keep it low

132
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,840
And put the roof on.

133
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,650
let them do what they want to Do.

134
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,810
I don't think we should Complain... Parvati.

135
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,290
I'm not complaining.

136
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,570
I'm just putting-- saying an Opinion. never mind.

137
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,250
I got it.

138
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,320
boston rob is like the

139
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,930
Bright, shining star, and he

140
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,750
Jets so frustrated with these Foolz.

141
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,890
I hope he doesn't drop dead in

142
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,530
The next few days because we'll All die.

143
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,920
There's no way around it.

144
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,490
You don't need to make this Like-- reinforced.

145
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,430
I thought we didn't have a Lot of time.

146
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,990
this is not good.

147
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,400
oh, there's the leaves.

148
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,170
well, this row and that row's

149
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,500
Going to cover all that.

150
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,970
we're at the hereose' camp.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
We're a bunch of professional

152
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,540
And seasoned "Survivors."

153
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,140
We're some of the best

154
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,550
"Survivors" Ever, the greatest.

155
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,110
let colby cut that one.

156
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,980
Just mark it and y'all know how Big you'll need them.

157
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,450
man, I love a working tribe.

158
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,420
I know, isn't that nice? yes.

159
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,120
even people that know what

160
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,720
They're doing.

161
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,630
Should we make coconut or what Do you think?

162
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,960
roasted coconut?

163
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,690
yeah.

164
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,860
yeah, popcorn.

165
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,600
let's do that.

166
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,700
stephenie.

167
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,670
For my game, it is a very good

168
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,070
Idea for me to get rid of steph.

169
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,210
I mean, she's a sweet girl, but

170
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,710
In the game, I think stephenie

171
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,440
Would side with anyone that got

172
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,550
Her one day further.

173
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,150
brown it a little more like

174
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,880
That one, right?

175
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,320
you want it to get crispy.

176
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,050
it's sticking pretty bad.

177
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,290
you're doing popcorn

178
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,020
Different than I ever did it, So.

179
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,490
Cook it dry and turn it around

180
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,660
In the sea salt.

181
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,930
See the white on the side,

182
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
That's assault? I don't know.

183
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,100
You're the cook.

184
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,700
rupert-- is starting to get a

185
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,600
Little bit annoying.

186
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,140
Every time I turn around, he's

187
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,910
Got an opinion about everything.

188
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,310
Like the coconut.

189
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,080
isn't that good?

190
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,880
that's good.

191
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,620
when you make them little,

192
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,920
Teeny chunks, your saliva mixes

193
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,690
In with them enough that you

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,560
Don't taste the hole as much and It's popcorn.

195
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,720
I'm just sitting back and

196
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,730
Being quiet because he could be

197
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,730
Trying to get me out of this Game.

198
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,830
I honestly think the guy is

199
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,230
Playing up the good guy role out Here.

200
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,170
And he is a good guy.

201
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,900
I'm not saying he's not, but

202
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,740
It's just-- you know, it's

203
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,970
Overkill right now.

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,080
It's day four, like, whoa.

205
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,450
we're going to tie each

206
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,380
Individual one to this.

207
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,190
no.

208
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,890
I need some more water.

209
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,390
The shelter sucks.

210
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,730
It's terrible.

211
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,430
And you know what I should have

212
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,270
Done from day one, say, "Listen,

213
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
You have to listen to me.

214
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,200
This is the way we're going to Do it.

215
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,300
If you don't like it, that's Fine.

216
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,810
I'll mark you down and I'll vote

217
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,810
You off first."

218
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,180
I didn't want to be a dictator

219
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,550
This time around.

220
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,620
I wanted to be the diplomat.

221
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,580
Look where that got me-- running

222
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,220
In circles.

223
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,150
I mean, they got me.

224
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,150
They got me good.

225
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:00,920
They whipped me.

226
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,890
And I just-- it, like, hit me.

227
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,990
I said that's enough.

228
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,130
It's over. It's done.

229
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,230
That's it.

230
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,600
so no more house?

231
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,330
no more.

232
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,570
I'm done.

233
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
You get me, right?

234
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,870
You feel me? I understand.

235
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:22,810
It's frustrating.

236
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,680
poarks god, why!

237
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,750
Why can't we have james and

238
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,780
Colby and rupert?

239
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,950
how did they get every, like,

240
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,150
Awesome guy, and we got randy!

241
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,420
are things going to get

242
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,290
Better at all before they get

243
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:44,830
Worse?

244
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,000
what's rob doing?

245
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,640
Why did he walk away?

246
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,500
I don't know.

247
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,540
I think everybody's kind of

248
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,770
Having a meltdown.

249
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,510
Not everybody.

250
00:10:51,540 --> 00:11:01,150
A lot of us are, but I'm not.

251
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,130
rob?

252
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,570
Hey, rob?

253
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,430
Rob?

254
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,670
Talk to me.

255
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,740
Rob.

256
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,410
Talk to me. What's going on?

257
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,580
Can you just open your eyes,

258
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,480
Please? Please, rob, come on.

259
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,710
Just look at me.

260
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,350
Your head hurts?

261
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,150
yeah.

262
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,120
what do you want me to do?

263
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,220
get help.

264
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,520
all right. I'll be right back.

265
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,760
Okay?

266
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,700
I saw the whole thing, and it

267
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,530
Really scared me.

268
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,000
I mean, I don't want to see

269
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,770
Anybody get hurt.

270
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,400
This is-- this is where

271
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,540
"Survivor" Gets serious because

272
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,140
It involves your life beyond the

273
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,980
Game, and without rob here, it's

274
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,680
Going to really hurt us.

275
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,780
We're going to slowly spiral

276
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,310
Down into a big pit of

277
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,450
Negativity, which I know is only

278
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,650
Going to get worse.

279
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,790
all right, we've got the

280
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,550
Medical team here now.

281
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,520
We're going to see how you are.

282
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,060
Can you open your eyes for us?

283
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,460
Rob, you can hear

284
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,560
Me?

285
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,000
Rob?

286
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,430
Coming up next ...

287
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,970
You can hear me?

288
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,370
hey.

289
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,810
I feel like... It's getting

290
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,740
The best of me.

291
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,250
Rob, you can hear me?

292
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,290
What's the problem?

293
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,660
140 over 70.

294
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,600
I've got some water for you, Mate?

295
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,500
Can you lift your hand up and

296
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,870
Porthe water in yourself?

297
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,400
the funny thing about being

298
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,770
Unconscious is you don't Remember anything.

299
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,110
I remember feeling really sick

300
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,540
And I thought I had to sit down,

301
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,440
And the next thing I remember

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,880
There was a doctor or somebody

303
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,650
Was talking and I heard jeff Probst talking.

304
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,350
In terms of giving an

305
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,480
Overall assessment, he looks

306
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,320
Worse than he is.

307
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,360
at the moment that's what we Think.

308
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,560
There's nothing we found on

309
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,260
Examining him that would concern Us.

310
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,530
Okay.

311
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,530
So you were definitely-- you

312
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,360
Were out.

313
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,900
I feel better, though.

314
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,300
Good.

315
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,640
You look a lot better right now.

316
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,810
Yeah.

317
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,210
I'm sorry.

318
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,810
E-why are you sorry?

319
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:47,750
it's just... I feel like...

320
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,760
It's getting the best of me.

321
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,790
And I love and respect it too

322
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,930
Much.

323
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,470
To not play, you know. yeah.

324
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,930
I want to win this game,

325
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,240
Dude. Watch this.

326
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,640
When I finally came to, I had a

327
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,310
Moment of clarity, and that was

328
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,310
Stop trying to be the good guy.

329
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,180
Because I'm trying to be so

330
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,950
Good, I physically made myself Sick.

331
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,720
Just do what everybody wants you

332
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,920
To d and be the villain.

333
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,690
You want a hand Getting up?

334
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,420
yeah, dude.

335
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,060
there was no way I was going To leave.

336
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,060
I mean, "Survivor" Is my life.

337
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,930
I love the game.

338
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,430
It's given me so much, and

339
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,600
There's no way I would ever Quit.

340
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,070
The doctors checked me out and

341
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,800
Basically told me I had the flu,

342
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,470
Maybe a little bit of case of

343
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,810
Cry babyitis.

344
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,040
You it's not easy.

345
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,350
It's been six years.

346
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,150
I just have to start smacking Them into shape.

347
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,420
Mariano's back.

348
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,450
yeah.

349
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,920
You're on your own.

350
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:04,630
okay.

351
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,200
what's happening, man?

352
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,500
I got real sick.

353
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,130
I was worried.

354
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,700
I've been having these Migraines, man.

355
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,910
And I think with the heat and

356
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,940
The exhaustion and everything,

357
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,280
It just got the best of me.

358
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,410
And that's it.

359
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,950
I should be good in 48 hours.

360
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,150
I was just telling-- I was just

361
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,690
Telling ... Boston rob came ba Bab-- back.

362
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,950
He's not out of the game.

363
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,550
Everything's cool.

364
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,660
Even though I'm the villain, I

365
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,890
Still-- I still worry a little

366
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,490
Bit about stuff like that.

367
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,960
Besides he's strong.

368
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,560
He gives us a better shot to win

369
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,440
The challenge.

370
00:15:50,370 --> 00:16:02,480
Come on in, guys!

371
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,650
Villains getting your first look

372
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,550
At the new hero tribe.

373
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,560
Sugar voted out at the last

374
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,990
Tribal council.

375
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,600

Then the next two go.

386
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,390

See how it plays out.

406
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,130
Because it runs in pairs, we

407
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,040
Need to even up the tribes.

408
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,400
That means, villains, you're

409
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,700
Sitting out two people.

You don't look happy, Rupert.

418
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
I don't want that I can run

419
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,760

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,470
Where is the "R?"

567
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,140
the "R" Is here.

568
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:28,900
this isn't right.

569
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,640
come on, you guys!

570
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,710
You guys gotta move!

571
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,840
this is it, j.T.

572
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,480
I said that in the beginning.

573
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,810
Villains are very

574
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,880
Close.

575
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,380
here we go!

576
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,820
Just get it up!

577
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,220
that's not-- is that right?

578
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,720
that's not right, that's not Right.

579
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,860
Get it back down.

580
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,990
Get it where it was.

581
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,530
guys move this over here.

582
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,230
Coordinate. what?

583
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,060
it's not right.

584
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,800
It's not right.

585
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,270
we all need to listen. One voice.

586
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,240
Heroes now starting To get frustrated.

587
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,600
what are we doing?

588
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,540
straight up.

589
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,280
Villains have one

590
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,380
Piece left but it's got to come

591
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,750
All the way to the top.

592
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,310
somebody push this towards Me.

593
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,780
spin it what way towards tom.

594
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,420
no, no, this is not right.

595
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,990
yeah.

596
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,720
shut up!

597
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,160
Heroes talking trash

598
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,120
To each other.

599
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,530
Not a good sign.

600
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,800
drop it!

601
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,900
we got it!

602
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,770
We got it!

603
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,270
Villains think they Have it.

604
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,840
Get to the top, villains.

605
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,610
Villains win the second immunity

606
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,080
Challenge in a row!

607
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,950
let's go home and just Collapse, dude.

608
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,950
you gotta have one voice, Y'all.

609
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,580
He was telling you all what to Do.

610
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,720
we were listening.

611
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,950
no, you were not.

612
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,790
he was telling you what to

613
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,220
Do.

614
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,090
Everybody's mouth wants to talk.

615
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,800
One voice.

616
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,900
james, I don't care who you

617
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,070
Are, I don't care where you're

618
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,540
At, you just don't talk to People like that.

619
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,240
The problem is I can't say

620
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,810
Anything because rupert already

621
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,870
Has it out for me, for whatever Reason.

622
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,240
Maybe I threaten his popularity,

623
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,650
I don't know. So I'm just trying to say as Little as possible.

624
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,450
Villains,

625
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,280
Congratulations once again.

626
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,950
Two challenges, two victoryes.

627
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,650
good job, guys.

628
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,020
Villains grab your

629
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,990
Tarp, rope, nails.

630
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,320
Head on back to camp.

631
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,190
good job, guys.

632
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,030
peace out.

633
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,330
Heroes, going to be

634
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,700
An interesting afternoon as for

635
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,470
The second time in a row, you

636
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,400
Guys will lose somebody at Tribal council.

637
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,170
Grab your stuff.

638
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,640
Head back to camp.

639
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,370
I will see you at tribal.

640
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,510
stephenie has been only

641
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,580
Person in "Survivor" History to

642
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,410
Lose every person in her tribe

643
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,450
To where she's the only one Left.

644
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,980
You know, she's, obviously, the Problem.

645
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,680
There's no other source of

646
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,550
Kryptonite in here to suck all

647
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,990
The super heroes' powers but Her.

648
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,720
It's like, wow, you need to go Home.

649
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,840
the challenge really sucked Today.

650
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,040
The last time we failed on the

651
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,610
Puzzle, no one really stepped Up.

652
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,480
And this time I said, "Hey, I've

653
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,620
Done this challenge before.

654
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,050
I'll be the man to run the Puzzle."

655
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,090
But there were a few people

656
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,290
Hohad to say, "No, please,

657
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,160
Please, listen to me."

658
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,290
It would have been a lot easier

659
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,520
If people had been listening

660
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,160
Instead of telling me what to Do.

661
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,660
Look I stepped up to the puzzle.

662
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,760
We didn't win.

663
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,260
I take responsibility.

664
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,400
nobody was listening.

665
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,370
nobody was listening.

666
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,730
boston rob is great at Puzzles.

667
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,340
He ideal and screamed at his Team.

668
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,840
He told them to shut up.

669
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,340
They all listened to him, and he Won.

670
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,570
I could have told-- I could

671
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,940
Have told everybody to shut up,

672
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,580
Too, and I didn't.

673
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,740
I just wanted everybody to be

674
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,610
Quiet and pay attention to what

675
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,310
That guy had to say. Pfs important.

676
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,020
we have to check our egos at

677
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,550
The door and follow who we

678
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,790
Designate to be the best job for

679
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,790
The challenge. one voice.

680
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,330
That's all I ask for is one damn Voice.

681
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,560
Then I get defensive people.

682
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,400
And then I get people telling

683
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,930
Everybody they're one.

684
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,900
I don't want to hear that.

685
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,900
One voice next time.

686
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,740
That's the only way we get to

687
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,500
The top.

688
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,100
We shut up and listen to the guy

689
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,440
That's done the challenge.

690
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,710
If you're defensive, you're Wrong.

691
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,640
There are going to be other

692
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,510
Challenges like this, and we

693
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,850
Need to focus.

694
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,910
Because I ain't never lost this

695
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,050
Much in my life.

696
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,520
That's all I'm saying.

697
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,550
This is ridiculous.

698
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:42,760
You need to suck it up.

699
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,230
that panicked scream and

700
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,570
Anguish cry of james when he got

701
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,710
Back to the hut, you know, all Right, great.

702
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,440
You've been a winner your whole Life?

703
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,880
I doubt it.

704
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,340
I'd love to tell him what a

705
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,880
Winner is and what a loser and

706
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,080
Where he fits into that-- that Equation.

707
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,580
And once again, I've got to hold

708
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,250
My tongue and not respond to

709
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:18,690
That, that kills me out here.

710
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,730
we have a tarp!

711
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,570
the most exciting moment.

712
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,170
it matches my outfit.

713
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,300
winning the challenge today

714
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,310
Was awesome, not only because we

715
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,610
Avoid tribal but also because we

716
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,040
Got a tarp.

717
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,410
Hats off to boston rob.

718
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,180
who loves you, baby?

719
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,280
I got something for you.

720
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,220
boston rob worked his ass off

721
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,190
In the challenge today.

722
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,420
No question about it. I respect that.

723
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,290
it's the elusive giant clam.

724
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,120
Do you want to touch it?

725
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,790
I don't know. I'm afraid.

726
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,660
come on.

727
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,290
You can touch my clam.

728
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,560
nice work, rob.

729
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,430
boston rob thinks that he's In charge.

730
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,900
I'm starting to think this just

731
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,340
Ain't working out.

732
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,740
I didn't know his personality

733
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:06,410
Was that strong.

734
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,510
But you know what?

735
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,040
This is where I'm in charge.

736
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
I am king russell.

737
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:19,920
From samoa.

738
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
wooo-hoo!

739
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,390
I got a chicken, baby.

740
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,230
we can make chicken soup.

741
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,590
we got a chicken.

742
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,230
They trying to catch fish.

743
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:40,010
You gotta catch real food.

744
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,110
her teams don't ever win.

745
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,410
Think about it.

746
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,250
She's made it to the end by Herself.

747
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,520
She was the only person left on The entire tribe.

748
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,050
You mean to tell me, that's good Luck?

749
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,720
Obviously, not.

750
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,290
Something just ain't right, and

751
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:04,170
It got to be her.

752
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,130
if they get rid of me over

753
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,870
Amanda and we've already lost Two?

754
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
you're in a bad spot, my Friend.

755
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,470
I know it.

756
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,840
this is the only girl who's

757
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,680
Made it to the end as one pers Person.

758
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,150
She's nullified her whole tribe

759
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,880
Until she was the last one left. yup.

760
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,220
it got to be her.

761
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,690
this is a lot different than

762
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,320
Our first.

763
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,960
Everyone was okay with sugar Going home.

764
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,930
She was not a part of any solid

765
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,290
Alliance.

766
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,600
So now, we're lking at a whole

767
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,030
Different ballgame because after

768
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,270
Tonight, I'm in one alliance in

769
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,370
This game.

770
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,200
I can either go with james,

771
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,040
Rupert, and amanda and bring

772
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,170
Sire and candace along.

773
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,540
Or I can go with colby, tom, and

774
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,640
Stephenie, and bring candace and Cirie along.

775
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,780
So one thing I do know, we're

776
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,880
Going to piss a few people off.

777
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,350
we should have won that, Rupe. it's okay.

778
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,390
It's as much my fault as any for

779
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,630
Not pushin push harder to be ine Challenge.

780
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,400
rupert's over there talking To j.T. Now.

781
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,560
right.

782
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,730
yeah, they're all--

783
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,670
they're all-- we're the three

784
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
On the outs.

785
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,940
It's all on the line today.

786
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,900
We know what we're up against.

787
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,910
And I'm not-- I don't have any

788
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,680
False illusions of loyalty from

789
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,280
From j.T. At this point.

790
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,480
This is the way it's going to

791
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,950
Be-- the order's going to be Stephenie, me, you.

792
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,760
We have to convince candace and

793
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,090
Cirie that the order's going to

794
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,590
Be stephenie, cirie, candace.

795
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,060
If I can get cirie and candace

796
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,570
To switch over with our

797
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,800
Three-some, send amanda home,

798
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,010
Then we're controlling this Game.

799
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,820
so, the plan is to get rid of

800
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,120
The weakest first, so that would

801
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,630
Help us if we got rid of amanda.

802
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,130
The problem with that plan is we

803
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,960
Don't know if j.T. Is with us or Not.

804
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,300
So if tom, colby, and myself can

805
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,630
Pull in cirie and candace, maybe

806
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,370
I am safe and we're going to get

807
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,240
Our five strong and come out of

808
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,680
This all right tonight.

809
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,880
But I can guarantee that you're Next. right.

810
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,450
I can promise you that.

811
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,890
Either you or cirie, if we have

812
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,360
To go to another tribal council,

813
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,760
And then whoever's left.

814
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,900
And I think we've got a better

815
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,000
Deal for you.

816
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,500
this vote today is crucial

817
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,770
Because the line will be drawn

818
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,900
In the sand, and you'll be on

819
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,270
One side or the other.

820
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,270
And I feel like I'm on the

821
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,880
Bottom of either alliance.

822
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,340
So I'm, like, which way do I go?

823
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,550
Which way is it worse? I don't know.

824
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,680
I'm really not in a good

825
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,120
Position anyway, you know what I Mean?

826
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,790
I think you're in the Position.

827
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,120
I think you're the swing vote Tonight.

828
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,390
everybody wants me to vote,

829
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,160
You know, one way tonight.

830
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,360
But... What about me down the Road, you know? right.

831
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:33,200
I mean, I really got to think

832
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,800
What's best for me. yup.

833
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,070
So one assurance you would have,

834
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,470
They all go home before you ever Go home.

835
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,410
You're not going to get that Deal on their side. yup.

836
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,040
I'm not even going to ask you

837
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,040
What you're going to do.

838
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,410
You and cirie are going to have

839
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,910
To decide if this is a move that

840
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,050
Makes sense to you.

841
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,750
Tom, colby, stephenie, are

842
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,850
Writing amanda's name down.

843
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,250
I'm trusting me gut on this, and

844
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,590
I think you should trust your

845
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,190
Gut on this, too and see where

846
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:06,000
It takes you.

847
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,730
all right, so what's the Deal?

848
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,870
tell me everything.

849
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,900
What's going on? I just want to do what's be Best.

850
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,670
Ultimately best for the long

851
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,370
Run, for now.

852
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,810
The problem with this decision

853
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,510
Is once this decision is made,

854
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,850
All the cards are out.

855
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,950
I know you guys are all

856
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,950
Tight, and I don't know, like,

857
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,620
Any of you guys from before, and

858
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,350
All that stuff--

859
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,890
see, that's the problem.

860
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,450
I don't know why everybody

861
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,550
Thinks we're so tight.

862
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,190
Yeah, me and amanda made it to

863
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,190
The end, but amanda chose

864
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,330
Parvati over me.

865
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,900
Amanda cost me a million Dollars.

866
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,860
So it's not like that.

867
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,700
I need somebody that I can Trust.

868
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,630
so do I.

869
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,000
and I don't really have

870
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,770
Anything else going for me.

871
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,500
hello.

872
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,570
so, I mean--

873
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,440
I think we have some common

874
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,410
Denominators.

875
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,250
so who goes first?

876
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,720
I don't know.

877
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,420
Honestly, as long as it's not

878
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,320
Us, it don't much matter to me.

879
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,660
J.T., the group of

880
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,990
Misfit villains, taking the

881
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,130
Heroes to the cleaners.

882
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,090
it's pretty embarrassing.

883
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:47,260
I stepped up today and didn't

884
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,630
Come through so I feel bad about That.

885
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,070
No one was listening.

886
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,300
And I notice on the villains

887
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,440
Boston rob telling everyone to

888
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,170
Shut up, and maybe I should have Done that.

889
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,910
James, you were as

890
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,410
Frustrated as I've seen you in

891
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,680
Playing this game three times.

892
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,780
there should have only been

893
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,480
One voice talking, and there Wasn't.

894
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,220
And I'm trying to make sure

895
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,020
Everybody is being quiet, and

896
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,120
There was a certain individual

897
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,590
Who voiced out their opinion

898
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,720
That they were being quiet.

899
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,790
So who was that?

900
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,520
stephenie.

901
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,830
I said, everybody shut up."

902
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,290
"Oh, I'm not talking."

903
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,830
that was after the challenge Was over. yes.

904
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,260
you looked at me and said,

905
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,270
"Hey, y'all."

906
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,300
darling, your name is not Y'all.

907
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,000
I'll be damned if there's

908
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,770
Anybody named y'all in here.

909
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,710
you're trying to blame the

910
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,410
Entire challenge on me.

911
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,010
baby, it's not about you, no

912
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,350
Matter how much you want to be

913
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,280
And how much you want crave it

914
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,780
To be you, it's not you.

915
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,980
I asked the question, and the

916
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,350
Person who usually tries to

917
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,990
Cover their back, they're the

918
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,590
One that has to.

919
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,320
You've been on the tribe where

920
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,830
You lost your entire team.

921
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,390
It was very romantic that you

922
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,800
Survived all your teammates on

923
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,660
Your tribe--

924
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,730
james, this isn't about me.

925
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,470
I thought you said it wasn't

926
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,140
About me let's get this rolling.

927
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,870
james, you just attacked her

928
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,170
And expect her to sit here and

929
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,410
Not defend herself.

930
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,240
You just total probst that there

931
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,410
Was one person who causedut the

932
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,180
Challenge today.

933
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,350
Now you're getting back to her

934
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:12,980
Past season.

935
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,620
Just let it be, bro.

936
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,160
the two of you all, how about That one?

937
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,290
Is that good enough.

938
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,430
make it the three of them All. Okay?

939
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,630
Alliances have been made. Divisions have been cast in the Tribe.

940
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,460
You repeating things and just

941
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,400
Bullying people until they Back--

942
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,700
I'm not bullying people.

943
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,600
you were bullying stiff me. I was not.

944
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,870
jeff asked who you were

945
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,570
Speaking about and you said her Name.

946
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,710
That does mean her.

947
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,810
That doesn't mean y'all.

948
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,610
That means stephenie.

949
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,810
if you walk up to somebody

950
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,910
And say I wasn't doing nothing,

951
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,180
Usually they're doing something.

952
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,350
maybe in your world, james.

953
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:46,950
I don't know.

954
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,820
I don't live in your world.

955
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,790
Anyway... this is unbelievable.

956
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,620
Colby, this has to be

957
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,730
Terribly alarming.

958
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,990
We're on day six.

959
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,000
I had no idea it would shift

960
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,170
From that team mentality to the

961
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,970
Self-preservation this early.

962
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,300
Stephenie, how

963
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,010
Concerned are you about past

964
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,180
Relationships in this game?

965
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,410
Worried that it could work

966
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,040
Against that you played with Tom?

967
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,250
oh, yeah. Absolutely.

968
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,720
I mean, yeah, we're friends.

969
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,050
But, I played against him and

970
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,220
Merged with him, and he cut my

971
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,090
Throat in the end.

972
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,890
Cirie, you, amanda,

973
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,990
And james all played together.

974
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:32,260
What do you do to deflect that?

975
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,760
like stephenie said, she

976
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,270
Played with tom, and tom cut her

977
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,130
Throat in the end.

978
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,600
The same thing kind of happened

979
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,170
With me and amanda at the very End.

980
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,370
Amanda chose parvati over me.

981
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,710
So if you think that's the route

982
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,140
I would want to take again,

983
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,610
Obviously, you don't know me.

984
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,050
Amanda, how concerned

985
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,920
Are you that your past

986
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,380
Relationship are going to come Back to haunt you?

987
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,020
legitimately concerned.

988
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,520
Because, you know, I've been

989
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,360
Hearing my name bounced around,

990
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,490
And it's alarming.

991
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,430
You know, you get really Nervous.

992
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,490
And you just hope you make the

993
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,630
Right choices and the right

994
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,700
Alliances and that's all you can

995
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,400
Do.

996
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,500
All right, it is time

997
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,940
To vote.

998
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:30,750
Rupert, you're up.

999
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,700
it's the plan.

1000
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:56,450
You're the weakest.

1001
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,880
I'll go tally the

1002
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:38,820
Votes.

1003
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,690
Once the votes are read, the

1004
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,420
Decision is final.

1005
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,890
The person voted out will be

1006
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,230
Asked to leave the tribal

1007
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,290
Council area immediately.

1008
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,260

Second person voted out of

1022

Heroes vs. Villains,"

1023
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,880
Stephenie. That's five. That's enough.

1024
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:51,260
You need to bring me your torch.

1025
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,730
Steph, the tribe has spoken.

1026
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,800
some advice, next time y'all

1027
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,770
Lose a challenge, a little less

1028
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,500
Cursing off your tribe might Help.

1029
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,900
keep your mouth shut.

1030
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,510
come on.

1031
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:12,380
it's been a pleasure.

1032
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,880
I think tonight's

1033
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,220
Tribal council speaks for Itself.

1034
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,750
Grab your torches.

1035
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,650
Head back to camp.

1036
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,390
Good night.

1037
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,540
Drive one.

1038
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,320
jeff: Stay tuned for scenes From our next episode. Next time on "Survivor":

1039
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,620
told you you are on the wrong Team, james.

1040
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,590
a hero spiralout of control.

1041
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,990
james got to bring down the

1042
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,890
Nasty, brutish, bullying.

1043
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,900
I just want to win, y'all.

1044
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,200
it's an ugly situation.

1045
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:00,870
you could have been gentler.

1046
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,770
I am upset that I'm out of The game.

1047
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,840
Take comfort in knowing that

1048
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,680
They definitely made the wrong

1049
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,040
Move by getting rid of me.

1050
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,280
These people don't even

1051
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,810
Genuinely try to get to know Each other.
