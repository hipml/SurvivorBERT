biggest threat to both tribes

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,091
was the weather.

00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,468
The Foa Foa tribe was hit

7
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:10,760
the hardest.

this cold, had my hands this

10

destroyed, and my feet look

11
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,682
so miserable.

constant rain and cold sucked

the life out of most of them,

15
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:19,978
Russell thrived.

This is really no big deal.

As a matter of fact, this makes

20
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,776
me stronger.

their huge 9-to-5 numbers

24

more bearable.

26
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,329
But at the immunity challenge,

27
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,874
both tribes got some

28
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,041
shocking news:

29
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,376
Both tribes going to

30
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,127
Tribal Council.

31
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,211

Then the brutal conditions

35
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,134
caught up to Russell, the

36
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,927
captain of Galu, who passed out

37
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,387
due to a combination of

38
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,681
dehydration and exhaustion.

39
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,183
There's no question to all of

you are not okay.

42
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,187
For his own safety, Russell was

43
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,689
taken out of the game, leaving

44
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,274
his tribe without a leader.

majority of the Foa Foa tribe

47
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,279
decided to send Liz home.

tonight.

65
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,264
The loss of Russell re-ignited

66
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,350
the rivalry between the

67
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,434

You know, losing our chief.

82
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,925
Losing probably the guy who I

83
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:14,467
had the most confidence in

84
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,220

88

5-4 gender-alliance lead,

90
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,896
but now with Russell gone, it's

91
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,106
just 4-4, and it's anybody's

00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,233

93
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658

other girls.

98
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,255
So we have to pull Shambo back

99
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,048
over to our side and make sure

100
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:54,591
that Shambo is like one of

we're going to lock Shambo in

138
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,900
is not only to, you know, to

tell her, "Hey, we're cool with

145
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,493

184
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,639
the new leader was stupid.

185
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,307
It went by so quickly that no

186
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,350
one even really realized

187
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,352
what happened.

188
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,520
Um, I don't know how Shambo got

189
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,896
elected leader.

190
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,398
And they're supposed to be

191
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,816
sending Shambo home last night.

192
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,442
I'm wondering if there was a

193
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,944
vote last night, would I have

194
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,238
been one of the people

195
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,114
voted for?

196
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,449
>> Okay, I would like my first

197
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,993
act of... to be one of

198
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,203
motivation and kindness.

199
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,247
I, obviously, did not ask

200
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:36,831
for this.

201
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,499
I will do the best I can by

202
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,125
you guys.

203
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,585
My leadership style is night

204
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,587
and day from Russ, and I will

205
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,629
honestly, honestly, honestly

206
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:48,676
do my due diligence to not be

207
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,053
bossy 'cause you can't really

208
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,722
be a sergeant in the United

209
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,223
States Marine Corps and not

210
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,391
have an expectation when you

211
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:55,933
say something, things

212
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,935
will happen.

213
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,979
>> I think us four guys plus

214
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,608
using Shambo as a wedge is a

215
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,610
good plan.

216
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,944
I mean, the only strategic

217
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,988
drawbacks I could think of is

218
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,366
that Shambo is just so dim that

219
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,619
she could screw up our plans if

220
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:25,046
we tell her anything.

221
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,590
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

222
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,435
How's everybody doing?

223
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:39,769
The sun is out.

224
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,187
>> Very thankful.

225
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,605
>> Happy, happy, happy.

226
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,105
>> PROBST: Shambo, you're

227
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,982
wearing the leadership necklace.

228
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,484
You're the leader of Galu?

229
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:46,776
>> Yes, sir.

230
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,486
>> PROBST: Surprised?

231
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,112
>> Not so much.

232
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,280
I've had a lifetime of

233
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:51,781
leadership skills through

234
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,574
just the way I was raised;

235
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,952
second-generation Marine, so

236
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,662
I just gotta keep things in

237
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,163
perspective and be calm.

238
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,289
>> PROBST: All right, we're

239
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:00,831
going to put your leadership

240
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,791
skills to test today.

241
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,876
You guys ready to get to

242
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,044
today's challenge?

243
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:05,878
>> Yep.

244
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,212
>> Definitely.

245
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:06,796
>> PROBST: Today's challenge

246
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,756
will test your memory and will

247
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,591
force to you make decisions

248
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,759
between wants and needs.

249
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,718
Here's how it works:

250
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,137
scattered out in the field

251
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,348
there are 13 pairs of matching

252
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,058
survival items.

253
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:19,684
One tribe member at a time will

254
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,520
walk out and uncover two items.

255
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,854
If they match, you score a

256
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:24,772
point for your tribe.

257
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,732
If at any point along the way,

258
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,526
the leader of your tribe

259
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,444
decides they would like to keep

260
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,821
the items you just matched, you

261
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,781
can do so, but you forfeit the

262
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,741
point in the challenge.

263
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,910
To make things more difficult,

264
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,121
four of the items are dummy

265
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,664
items that do not have a match.

266
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,999
The tribe who has the most

267
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,333
points at the end of challenge

268
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:44,709
wins reward.

269
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,960
Want to know what you're

270
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:46,586
playing for?

271
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:46,961
>> Yes, sir.

272
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:47,169
>> Yeah.

273
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,212
>> PROBST: Winning tribe

274
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,505
will leave from here and board

275
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,506
a beautiful sailboat.

276
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,216
>> Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

277
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,259
>> PROBST: You'll enjoy an

278
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:53,843
afternoon out on the water and

279
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,553
a nice lunch.

280
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,596
>> Oh!

281
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,388
>> PROBST: In addition, the

282
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,556
winning tribe will send one

283
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,849
person from their tribe to the

284
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,434
losing tribe to do a little

285
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,019
spying until the next

286
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:03,436
immunity challenge.

287
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,313
You guys ready to get to it?

288
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:05,688
>> Yes.

289
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,314
>> Yes, sir.

290
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,231
>> PROBST: Galu you're sitting

291
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,399
out three people this challenge.

292
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,525
This is a new cycle.

293
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:10,735
You can sit out whoever you

294
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,360
you want.

295
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,070
>> Kelly, Dave, and myself will

296
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,821
sit out.

297
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,697
>> PROBST: Kelly, Dave, and

298
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,323
Shambo.

299
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,615
You guys take a spot on

300
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:16,991
the bench.

301
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,117
Everybody else, give you a

302
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,784
minute to strategize.

303
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,786
We'll get started.

304
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,373
All right, Shambo, since you

305
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,000
are the new leader and you are

306
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,376
not participating, who do you

307
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,835
want to assign to make

308
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,420
decisions for Galu

309
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,212
in this challenge?

310
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:30,963
>> Erik.

311
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,341
>> No, no, Brett, Brett, Brett.

312
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,550
>> I stand corrected; Brett.

313
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,634
>> PROBST: Brett will be the

314
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,135
fill-in leader for this

315
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,470
challenge.

316
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:37,887
All right, head out.

317
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,723
Russell goes out first for Foa

318
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,558
Foa, who won the rock,

319
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:42,892
paper, scissor.

320
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,894
That is a fire-starting kit.

321
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,854
That is representative of what

322
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,814
the real kit looks like.

323
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,899
It is much larger.

324
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,152
And rope, no match.

325
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,487
Cover 'em back up.

326
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,240
Galu. John heads out for his

327
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,368
first shot at this challenge.

328
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,581
John finds the cleaver.

329
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,542
Right next door, mosquito net.

330
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,211
No match for Galu.

331
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,129
Should get interesting now.

332
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,715
Jaison heading out for Foa Foa.

333
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,302
A lantern and oil.

334
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,470
That has not been revealed

335
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,054
anywhere else so it's a wild

336
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:24,642
guess, shot in the dark.

337
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,435
Fire starting kit.

338
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,019
No match.

339
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,020
>> That's a big break.

340
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:28,979
Big break.

341
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:29,814
>> I got it.

342
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:30,940
>> PROBST: Galu.

343
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,357
>> Go get it, Laura.

344
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,733
>> PROBST: Laura going out now.

345
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,194
Looking for that first match.

346
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,779
Laura finds one fire starting

347
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,988
kit.

348
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:38,864
Jaison just uncovered one.

349
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:43,077
Can Laura remember where it was?

350
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,161
And she does.

351
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:44,829
Laura scores the first match

352
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,289
for Galu.

353
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,582
As I said, that is merely

354
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,959
representative.

355
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,961
This is the kit.

356
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,003
Everything you need to get fire

357
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,964
started all wrapped in a tarp.

358
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:55,798
>> We'll keep it.

359
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,632
>> Thank God.

360
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,550
>> PROBST: Brett's going to

361
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,426
keep this one.

362
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,802
>> Good job, Galu.

363
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,970
>> Good job, team.

364
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:01,804
>> That tarp's gonna keep us

365
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,179
dry, right? Right?

366
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,931
>> PROBST: Galu scores the

367
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,433
first match but forfeits the

368
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,226
point in exchange for keeping

369
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,186
the item.

370
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,272
We're still at 0-0.

371
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,649
Foa Foa, head out.

372
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,775
Liz with her first time out on

373
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,569
the course would love to get

374
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,195
lucky.

375
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:18,946
Liz finds the cleaver.

376
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,615
>> Oh, gosh, Liz, come on.

377
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,741
>> PROBST: Can Liz remember

378
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,410
where the other cleaver was?

379
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,791
She guesses wrong, she could

380
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,252
reveal an item that helps Galu.

381
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,380
Liz reveals a mosquito net.

382
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,132
Not a match.

383
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,884
Opening the door for Galu.

384
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:46,056
Brett out on the course.

385
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,683
Wasted no time.

386
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,767
Brett finds the mosquito

387
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,186
netting.

388
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,730
Now he's got to pair it up.

389
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,814
And he does.

390
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,899
>> Good job.

391
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,317
>> PROBST: Galu with a match.

392
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,277
Brett, you're keeping that item

393
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,153
or are you keeping the point?

394
00:12:59,236 --> 00:12:59,820
>> Point.

395
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,071
>> PROBST: Galu with their

396
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,072
first point.

397
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,033
Galu now leads one-zip.

398
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:04,658
>> Shh!

399
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,701
>> Liz, I gotta talk if I'm

400
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,368
gonna figure out where this

401
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:06,619
stuff is.

402
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,786
>> But we need to whisper.

403
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,496
>> PROBST: Foa Foa, you're up.

404
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,371
>> Do you know where the other

405
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:09,663
cleaver was?

406
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,748
it was right over here.

407
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,373
>> PROBST: Natalie, first time

408
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:11,916
out on the course.

409
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,585
Foa Foa needs a match.

410
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,879
>> I'm trying to decide.

411
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,423
>> PROBST: You're on your own

412
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,174
when you're out here.

413
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,383
You cannot get help from your

414
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,009
tribe.

415
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,136
Natalie reveals a hammock.

416
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,811
Natalie finds a pot.

417
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,979
Does not match.

418
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,398
This challenge not as easy as

419
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,650
it seems.

420
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,859
Lot of items out here.

421
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,945
It gets hard to remember.

422
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,786
John matches for Galu.

423
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,080
Galu leads 2-zip.

424
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,123
Russell pairs up for Foa Foa.

425
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:53,916
Laura reveals rope and matching

426
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,876
rope.

427
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,546
It is now 3-1.

428
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,922
Jaison reveals hammer and nails.

429
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,508
No match for Foa Foa.

430
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,008
(humming tune)

431
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,051
>> PROBST: Erik has a cocky

432
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,052
swagger.

433
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,054
Not a match.

434
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,139
Nick reveals the blanket...

435
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,182
Another match for Foa Foa.

436
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,183
No match for Galu...

437
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,184
Erik chooses wrong...

438
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,227
Brett out on the course.

439
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,228
And Brett matches it up.

440
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,229
>> Yes!

441
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,230
>> Yes!

442
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,189
>> PROBST: For Galu.

443
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,524
>> Good job, B. Good job, B.

444
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,775
>> PROBST: Mask, snorkel and a

445
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:20,359
spear goes along with that.

446
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,236
Brett is that an item you're

447
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,320
considering keeping?

448
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,321
>> Point.

449
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,531
>> PROBST: Everybody choosing

450
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,574
points over items.

451
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,616
That reward looking good.

452
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,951
Galu now leads six-three.

453
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,745
There are only three items left

454
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,122
out here.

455
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:33,914
The rest are dummy items that

456
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,375
do not have a match.

457
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,001
Do the math, Foa Foa.

458
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,337
All Galu needs to do is match

459
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,130
one more pair, and they win this

460
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,799
challenge.

461
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,843
Foa Foa, head out.

462
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,970
Natalie out on the course.

463
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,472
Natalie finds the pot.

464
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,349
She'd like to match that up,

465
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,435
score a point for her tribe.

466
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,436
>> Let's see.

467
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,437
Let's see.

468
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,397
Oh, my word.

469
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,648
>> PROBST: Foa Foa needs to

470
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,818
match this up.

471
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:03,819
>> Yay!

472
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:04,820
>> PROBST: Natalie matches up

473
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:05,070
the pots.

474
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:05,988
(indistinct chatter)

475
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,032
Foa Foa staying in it.

476
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,075
It's now six-four.

477
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,870
If Galu matches on this turn,

478
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,038
they win the challenge.

479
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,457
Monica out on the course and on

480
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,002
her own now.

481
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,211
Monica reveals the eating

482
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,921
utensils.

483
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,049
If she can match this up, Galu

484
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,176
wins.

485
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,969
And she does with confidence.

486
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,596
>> Yeah!

487
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,348
>> PROBST: Galu wins reward.

488
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,852
>> (screaming): Yes!

489
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:37,936
>> PROBST: Galu, under the new

490
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,647
leadership of Shambo, you

491
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,690
continue to do very well in this

492
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,691
game.

493
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,234
Not only do you win a beautiful

494
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,403
reward and a nice afternoon,

495
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,905
you're taking back with you a

496
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,158
fire-making kit and a tarp.

497
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,451
All right, Shambo, you now have

498
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,994
another big decision to make.

499
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,162
You have to now send somebody

500
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,582
from your tribe over to Foa Foa,

501
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,208
which means they will not go on

502
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,167
the sailboat.

503
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,294
They will not have an afternoon

504
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,295
lunch.

505
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,838
They will not get a break from

506
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,839
camp.

507
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,132
Who are you going to send over

508
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,133
to Foa Foa?

509
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,301
>> I'm going to send Laura over

510
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,844
to Foa Foa because I need to

511
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,387
keep my guys strong for our

512
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,097
challenge tomorrow, and I'm not

513
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,099
sending myself for a third time.

514
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,308
>> PROBST: Laura, how does that

515
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,559
sound to you?

516
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,561
>> I'll take it for the team.

517
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,562
>> Now that Shambo's chief,

518
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,146
it's like she was raised in a

519
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,189
trailer park, married a rich

520
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,024
guy, and now she's driving

521
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,442
around in a Jaguar treating

522
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,235
everyone like crap, you know?

523
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,529
She sent Laura over to the other

524
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,613
tribe, and Laura's one of our

525
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,614
strongest females.

526
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,615
I don't know if she has a

527
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,616
strategy, I don't know if she's

528
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,701
just pulling it out of her ass,

529
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,702
I don't know.

530
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,703
>> PROBST: Laura will return to

531
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,121
Galu at the next immunity

532
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,122
challenge.

533
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,123
Galu, grab your tarp, head out.

534
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,124
>> Yeah!

535
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,125
>> PROBST: Boat's waiting for

536
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,126
you.

537
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,127
>> Got it? All right.

538
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,128
>> PROBST: Foa Foa, got nothing

539
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,129
for you.

540
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,130
Grab your stuff.

541
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,548
Head back to camp.

542
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,133
>> It's just like, we just walk

543
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,468
away losing again, but we do

544
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,053
have a pox or a hex or some kind

545
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,096
of curse on Foa Foa.

546
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,097
I don't know.

547
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,098
I'm starting to get

548
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,141
superstitious at this point, you

549
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:14,491
know?

550
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,492
>> Hello. I'm Natalie.

551
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,493
>> I'm Laura. Nice to meet you.

552
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,494
>> Nice to meet you, Laura.

553
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,495
>> Finally.

554
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,496
>> Hey, Laura. Mick.

555
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,497
>> Hi, Mick.

556
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,290
>> Good to formally meet you,

557
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,291
finally.

558
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,292
>> Good to formally meet you.

559
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,293
>> Pleasure.

560
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,294
>> I'm Liz.

561
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,295
>> Hi, Liz. Good to meet you.

562
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,296
>> Hi. How are you?

563
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,213
>> Good. Hi, Russell.

564
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,214
Good to meet you.

565
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:29,631
>> Nice to meet you.

566
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,257
>> Welcome.

567
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,258
>> This is home, huh?

568
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,217
At Foa Foa camp, everybody is

569
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,218
really friendly.

570
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,095
Um, they're doing their very

571
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,138
best to make me feel

572
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,139
comfortable, and I sincerely

573
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,141
appreciate it.

574
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,142
>> Yeah...

575
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,518
I figured Shambo would send me.

576
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,519
>> Oh, really?

577
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,103
>> Yeah, I figured she would

578
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,104
send me over.

579
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,105
>> Hmm.

580
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,148
>> So... it's all right, though.

581
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,149
>> Yeah.

582
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,150
>> There's definitely an

583
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,779
undercurrent why Sham sent me

584
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,822
over to the Foa Foa tribe.

585
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,324
I mean... I mean, clearly, she

586
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,325
doesn't like me.

587
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,326
Oh, thank you!

588
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,327
>> That's for you.

589
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,328
>> Thank you!

590
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,329
>> You want to come with me and

591
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,413
find some crabs, show you how to

592
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,414
do this?

593
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,415
>> Yes! Absolutely.

594
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,416
Okay, so you have twins.

595
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,417
>> Mm-hmm.

596
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,126
I have twin girls that's nine.

597
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,420
My dad's a preacher.

598
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,421
>> He is?

599
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,422
I'm a theology student.

600
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,423
>> Really?

601
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,424
>> Mm-hmm.

602
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,425
I got my degree in women's

603
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,426
ministries.

604
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,427
>> Really?

605
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,428
>> I don't want to be a pastor

606
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,429
of men.

607
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,430
I don't believe that, um...

608
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,473
>> Mm-hmm.

609
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,474
>> ...that's the women's role.

610
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,475
>> Yeah, but anyway, I'm glad

611
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,476
you came here...

612
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,477
>> Wow.

613
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,770
>> ...and if you want to listen,

614
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,354
I'll have something that I can

615
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,355
bring to the table.

616
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,356
>> I'll totally listen.

617
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,357
>> Uh, I think, eventually, your

618
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,109
butt's going to be on the

619
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,110
chopping block.

620
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,111
>> Totally.

621
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,112
>> It might not be as fast as

622
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:34,696
mine, but eventually, it will.

623
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,282
But if we can get together, you

624
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,283
could protect me at the merge,

625
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,284
and I can protect you.

626
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,619
You know, when it comes down to

627
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,620
it, I hope it's final three,

628
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,621
'cause you know what I hope?

629
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,872
I would hope it would be me,

630
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,873
you and Natalie in the final

631
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,875
three.

632
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,459
Well, I was happy when they

633
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,419
decided to send Laura to our

634
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,880
camp, because it doesn't look

635
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,422
like we're going to go with

636
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,508
numbers into a merge, so what I

637
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,175
have to do now is work my

638
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,345
Houdini magic on Laura.

639
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,304
I can spot a good Christian any

640
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,347
time.

641
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,182
It's easy.

642
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,600
So I'm starting to really like

643
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,601
you now.

644
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,602
(Laura laughs)

645
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,063
>> Brother from another mother.

646
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,606
>> So, I'm going to start

647
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,649
working her, working her,

648
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,651
working her like a fine tool.

649
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,986
You know, until she's sharpened

650
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,113
enough just where I want her.

651
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,406
I swear to you, you can trust

652
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,407
me.

653
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,867
>> What are we going to do, go

654
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,492
to the final two, the two of us

655
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,410
together?

656
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,411
>> Final two.

657
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,705
>> Russell came to me and was

658
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,290
conspiring to have this secret

659
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,791
alliance that, clearly, nobody

660
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,293
would ever suspect.

661
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,712
And, you know, that's another

662
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,296
card that I stick in my pocket

663
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,422
that I might want to play.

664
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,423
I mean, you know, it's just food

665
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,424
for thought.

666
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,425
>> And by the way, that clue you

667
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,426
have?

668
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,427
>> Yeah.

669
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,428
>> You might as well throw it

670
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,429
away.

671
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,430
There's no immunity idol here.

672
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,431
>> Did you find it?

673
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,432
>> Ben found it and didn't play

674
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,433
it.

675
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:49,813
Hid it somewhere in the camp.

676
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,272
(indistinct chatter)

677
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,231
>> Oh, my gosh!

678
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,358
(indistinct chatter)

679
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,444
>> Awesome.

680
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,323
>> Wow!

681
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,874
>> The reward was phenomenal.

682
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,417
We're on this rowboat, headed

683
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,669
toward a pirate ship in the

684
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,212
middle of the islands of Samoa,

685
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,006
and honestly, I just felt like I

686
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,049
don't even deserve that, you

687
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,050
know?

688
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,343
Like, what have I ever done in

689
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,720
life that has been so great that

690
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,763
deserves that kind of an

691
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,933
opportunity?

692
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:30,687
(applause, indistinct chatter)

693
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,774
>> Are we helping, or are we

694
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,775
watching?

695
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,776
>> Uh, you're doing both.

696
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,903
>> Excellent.

697
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,489
>> Yay!

698
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,533
Yay!

699
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,411
>> Haul away!

700
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,412
>> Haul away, come on!

701
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:51,667
(whooping, indistinct chatter)

702
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,043
>> Yeah, get it E!

703
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,044
>> Use your youthful exuberance

704
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,212
of the purple team.

705
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,213
>> That's the spirit!

706
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,341
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

707
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,510
>> Ahoy, matey!

708
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,472
>> Ahoy, matey!

709
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,307
>> Come on!

710
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,308
(whooping)

711
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,309
>> You have to turn the wheel

712
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,310
to the right.

713
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,311
>> Okay.

714
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,312
>> Yeah.

715
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,313
>> Wait!

716
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,108
(screams and whoops)

717
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,109
(whooping)

718
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,110
>> I'm a sailor!

719
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:21,238
>> A pirate ship!

720
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,739
>> You're, like, the captain of

721
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,407
a pirate ship ready to go rob

722
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,408
some booty.

723
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,451
(laughter)

724
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,079
A little gold, a little

725
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,330
wenchin', a little groggin'.

726
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:34,167
A little more wenchin'.

727
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,169
Uh-oh, look what's coming out.

728
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,170
Oh, baby.

729
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,171
>> Oh!

730
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,172
>> Mm-hmm.

731
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,590
>> Yay!

732
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,346
>> Yes!

733
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,889
They fed us this beef stew that

734
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,890
was delicious.

735
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,393
It was almost all meat and a big

736
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,272
chunk of handmade bread and

737
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:55,731
these amazing scones.

738
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,859
They were delicious.

739
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:02,112
I was having a good time, man.

740
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,493
>> This is so beautiful.

741
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,454
What a nice change after 16

742
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,039
days of hell.

743
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,458
My God! Thank you, Lord.

744
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,211
>> And I appreciate you

745
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,171
not sending me.

746
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,380
Shambo ended up sending Laura

747
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,382
to the other camp.

748
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,926
I think it just was her own

749
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,303
little way of saying, "I'mn

750
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,346
"leader now, and what

751
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,055
I say goes."

752
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,057
I mean, she'd never admit that.

753
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,725
>> I didn't relish the thought

754
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,601
of sending anybody over there,

755
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,728
but I'm also not gonna feel

756
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,229
bad about it because I think

757
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,606
that I did the right thing by

758
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,484
the tribe, I really do.

759
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,117
♪ ♪

760
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,508
>> I would've never guessed

761
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,926
that in a million years.

762
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,428
That's cool.

763
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,228
>> As long as we have

764
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,604
a flame...

765
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,617
And I was just, like, "Yeah."

766
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,035
>> You know, I understand we

767
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,828
have a guest.

768
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,329
You know, Laura's come here to

769
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,956
hang out with us until the next

770
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,165
immunity challenge, but I don't

771
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:37,707
really need to hear her and

772
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,417
Natalie talking about the

773
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,001
spiritual book of, you know,

774
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:40,585
spiritual book of the month,

775
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,712
like, behind my back, when I'm

776
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,256
trying to get a fire started so

777
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,258
that we can eat and drink.

778
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:46,883
>> Whoo! I'm going get my hands

779
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,051
washed.

780
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,137
Do you need to do any kind of

781
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,096
laundry or anything?

782
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,013
>> Oh, gosh.

783
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,890
>> It's just really infuriating

784
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,267
because they're not helping.

785
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,809
It's time to start a fire.

786
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,602
All they're doing is sitting

787
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,937
there picking their toes and,

788
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,313
like, catching up on good times.

789
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,481
So it was really, really

790
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,608
frustrating, disappointing, and

791
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,279
at times, rather infuriating.

792
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,447
This is like a crisis, and

793
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,031
they're talking about their

794
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,408
faith and books.

795
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,742
Russell, I understand we have a

796
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,035
guest, but they're talking about

797
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,078
book-of-the-month club.

798
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:15,829
>> Yeah.

799
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,664
>> Damn!

800
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,624
>> Liz is so stupid.

801
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,500
I don't even see how she can

802
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,502
walk without falling down.

803
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,337
It's just ridiculous.

804
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,797
If we merge, we need somebody

805
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,132
on the inside, and Natalie's

806
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,842
doing a good job talking to

807
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,885
Laura around the camp.

808
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,137
So I have to keep Natalie for

809
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,096
my little toy.

810
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,973
You know, she has to be there

811
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,766
for me so I can manipulate her

812
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,642
little mind and do what I want

813
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,727
her to do.

814
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,104
When it comes to this game, you

815
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:41,730
better be street smart, and Liz

816
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,191
has a mouth on her, and I don't

817
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,609
think she knows when to shut up

818
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,485
so I'm going to keep my eye

819
00:24:47,569 --> 00:25:02,667
on her.

820
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,295
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

821
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,520
All right, Laura,

822
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,815
you can now rejoin Galu.

823
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,193
Galu is back intact.

824
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,736
You guys ready to get to

825
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,111
today's challenge?

826
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,488
>> Yep.

827
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,989
>> PROBST: First things first,

828
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,866
Brett, take back immunity.

829
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,825
Thank you.

830
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,994
>> Mm-hmm.

831
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,792
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

832
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,545
is back up for grabs.

833
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,129
For today's challenge, both

834
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,132
tribes will paddle out to

835
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,134
retrieve fish-shaped

836
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:53,969
puzzle pieces.

837
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,012
Once you've collected all six

838
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,347
sets, you'll then paddle back

839
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,723
where three tribe members will

840
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,017
use those pieces to solve

841
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:01,977
a puzzle.

842
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,603
First tribe to get it right

843
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,856
wins immunity;

844
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,400
safe from the vote.

845
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,651
Losers... Tribal Council;

846
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,945
somebody going home.

847
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,072
Galu, last challenge it was

848
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,615
Shambo, Kelly, and Dave Ball

849
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,952
who sat out, so you three have

850
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:19,327
to participate.

851
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,204
Who are going to be the

852
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:21,788
sit-outs, Shambo?

853
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,832
>> It's gonna be, uh, John,

854
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,210
Monica, and Laura.

855
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:27,794
>> PROBST: All right, before

856
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,879
you go, though, Mick, where's

857
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,631
the leadership necklace?

858
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,633
>> Uh, well, we left it back,

859
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,551
actually.

860
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,012
We were, uh, halfway wondering

861
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,305
if maybe it was bad luck.

862
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,597
>> PROBST: But you still have

863
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,307
a leader?

864
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,849
>> Yes, absolutely.

865
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,308
>> PROBST: All right.

866
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,268
As long as you have a leader,

867
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:43,893
the necklace is merely symbolic.

868
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,604
we will see if that is the

869
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:46,980
difference.

870
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,565
Laura, Monica, John, take a

871
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,566
spot on the bench.

872
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,108
Everybody else, give you a

873
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,568
minute to strategize,

874
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,112
we'll get started.

875
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,989
Here we go.

876
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,283
Galu hoping to continue

877
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,034
their dominance.

878
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,077
Foa Foa hoping that necklace

879
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,163
was, indeed, bad luck.

880
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,458
Survivors ready?

881
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,876
Go!

882
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,715
Three people paddling,

883
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,843
two people fishing.

884
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,972
>> Hop in, Erik.

885
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,474
>> PROBST: Foa Foa using

886
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,892
the height of Jaison to

887
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:24,726
still push their boat.

888
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,686
Foa Foa starting to pull

889
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,771
away now.

890
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,730
>> Dave, hop out!

891
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,856
Guide us, guide us!

892
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:30,857
>> I'm up an out!

893
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,068
>> PROBST: Galu now getting in

894
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,235
the water trying to push

895
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,031
their boat as well.

896
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,159
Natalie has one for Foa Foa.

897
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,619
>> Here you go, here you go.

898
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,871
>> Right there!

899
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,539
Bring it to you.

900
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,874
>> PROBST: Dave Ball has the

901
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,709
first one for Galu.

902
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,043
>> Right here.

903
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,295
>> Come on, Liz.

904
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:52,712
There you go.

905
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,381
Pull it up.

906
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,632
>> PROBST: Liz has one for

station.

910
00:27:59,469 --> 00:27:59,844
>> Come on, you bitch!

911
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:05,183
Come on! Oh!

912
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,309
>> Nice job, Liz!

913
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,811
>> PROBST: Liz hooks the third

914
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,854
set of puzzle pieces for

>> Come on, Dave, you can do it.

922
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,364
>> Yeah, yeah.

923
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,366

Foa Foa has one set left!

931
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:33,545
>> All right.

932
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,003
I need to concentrate.

933
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:34,796
I need silence, please.

934
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,173
>> You can do it, Dave.

935
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,091
>> Be quiet!

936
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,300
>> Come on, baby.

937
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,593

>> All right, we're going.

943
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:47,350
Move it!

944
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,893
>> PROBST: Liz and Natalie

puzzle pieces.

That last string of puzzle

948

pieces.

949
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,066

>> Push!

957
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,491
>> Get on it, both of you!

958
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,868
>> Quiet!

959
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:05,785
>> Got it.

960
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,995
>> PROBST: Kelly has the fifth

961
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,663
set for Galu.

962

963
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,248

Galu now heading back.

967
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,880

>> PROBST: Foa Foa has one

969
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:22,093
paddler and two swimmers.

970

>> PROBST: Galu trying to push

972
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,430
their boat as well.

973
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,682
A lot more work to swim it than

974
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,142
it is to paddle it.

975
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,478

Everybody paddling.

979
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,732
>> Full paddle forward!

980
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,692
>> Paddle!

981
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,568

984
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:41,946
gaining on Foa Foa.

985
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:48,578

00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,913
>> PROBST: Foa Foa getting it

987
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,247
done without Jaison!

988
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,582
Foa Foa's hooked in.

989
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,041
Get back to your mat.

990
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,418
Galu's hooked in.

991
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,170
Get back to your mat!

00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,589
(groaning)

993

>> Set up time!

994
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,929

996
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,390
working on the puzzle any time

997
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,600
you like while other

998
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,643
people untie.

999
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,102
Liz working on the puzzle for

1000
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,521
Foa Foa.

1001
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,773
Dave, Kelly, Brett, working the

1002
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,857
puzzle for Galu.

1003
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,318
Jaison, Mick, and Liz working

1004
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,444
it for Foa Foa.

1005
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,487
>> Here's the last one.

1006
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,071
They're going to make a

1007
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,822
line, yeah?

1008
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:28,701
>> Shh!

1009
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,078
>> Liz, I gotta talk to

1010
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:30,495
somebody, all right?

1011
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,788
Stop shushing me.

1012
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,705
>> PROBST: Look for

1013
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,706
the patterns.

1014
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,165
Something to help make

1015
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:34,916
sense of it.

1016
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,793
>> Look at the colors.

1017
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,460
Match the colors.

1018
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:41,589
>> We are, we have! Look. See?

1019
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,006
>> Yeah, that's...

1020
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,509
>> PROBST: Jaison frustrated.

1021
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,843
You can't give up.

1022
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,136
>> Can they fit like this?

1023
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,346
>> Like this?

1024
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,264
>> Yeah.

1025
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,640
>> PROBST: Every single inch of

1026
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,099
this may not be filled

1027
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,476
with fish.

1028
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,936
There may be gaps in

1029
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:55,228
this puzzle.

1030
00:30:55,311 --> 00:31:00,024
That may be part of the pattern.

1031
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,067
>> PROBST: Foa Foa thinks

1032
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,861
they're on to it.

1033
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,241
Galu starting to get a pattern

1034
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,617
pattern going.

1035
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,286
Follow that pattern.

1036
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,582
If you've got it, follow it.

1037
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,083
>> Here you go, good job.

1038
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,084
>> PROBST: Galu starting to

1039
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,545
pull away now.

1040
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,463
Jaison, Liz, and Mick

1041
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,716
struggling to keep in this.

1042
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,592
>> Goes like this.

1043
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,551
Yeah, like that.

1044
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,885
>> PROBST: Galu thinks they have

1045
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:28,761
have it.

1046
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,013
Galu wins immunity!

1047
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,931
(all cheering)

1048
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,391
>> Yeah, baby!

1049
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:33,933
Right on!

1050
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,394
>> Whoo!

1051
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,983
>> PROBST: Galu, once again

1052
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,110
immunity is yours.

1053
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,073
Well, Mick, it looks

1054
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,867
looks like it wasn't

1055
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,451
the necklace.

1056
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,244
>> We had the pattern, I think,

1057
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:53,620
before they did.

1058
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,371
We just couldn't get the pieces

1059
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,122
together quick enough.

1060
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:56,956
You know, again, it's

1061
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,875
frustrating.

1062
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,460
>> PROBST: All right, Foa Foa,

1063
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,252
once again Tribal Council

1064
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,338
tonight where one of the five

1065
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,464
of you are going home.

1066
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,548
Grab your stuff.

1067
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,174
Head back to camp.

1068
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,718
>> These idiots are probably

1069
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,053
gonna cost me

1070
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:10,470
a million dollars.

1071
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,764
I planned on having a lot of

1072
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:13,765
fun with the money,

1073
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,599
a lot of fun.

1074
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,183
Maybe we need to get rid of

1075
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,393
Jaison because he gave up

1076
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:17,685
out there.

1077
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,437
He's just standing there

1078
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,855
looking at the puzzle like it's

1079
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:21,230
gonna move itself.

1080
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,650
We gotta mix something up, so

1081
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,443
what happens, happens.

1082
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,492
♪ ♪

1083
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,275
>> This whole time I wanted to

1084
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,235
get rid of Liz, get rid of Liz.

1085
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,070
But you know what?

1086
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,697
Jaison gave up when we were

1087
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,280
pushing the boat, and then he

1088
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,616
was so tired, he couldn't even

1089
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,034
get up there and do a puzzle.

1090
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,120
It's amazing to me that he

1091
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,162
can't, you know, get these

1092
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,247
puzzles down.

1093
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,248
I don't know.

1094
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,750
He's sure not going to be my

1095
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,086
attorney.

1096
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,130
How in the world are they

1097
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,339
beating us in puzzles, Mick?

1098
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,757
>> I don't know.

1099
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,758
>> Jaison went...

1100
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,801
You went to medical school,

1101
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,844
Jaison when to freakin' Oxford,

1102
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:33,845
Stanford.

1103
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:34,846
>> I know. I know. I know.

1104
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,847
I know.

1105
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,848
>> Gee!

1106
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:37,849
>> I can't explain it, my

1107
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,850
friend.

1108
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,978
I cannot explain it.

1109
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,866
>> Agreed.

1110
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:55,491
>> You know, like, when you lose

1111
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,702
so much, all you want to do is,

1112
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,286
like, go into, like... crawl

1113
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,204
into a hole, fetal position?

1114
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,166
That's how I feel.

1115
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,546
>> Quite embarrassed.

1116
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,213
>> I don't get it.

1117
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,214
We were ahead, too.

1118
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,300
I just don't know what... how

1119
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,385
we... why we always lose our

1120
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,512
lead.

1121
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,187
>> I have no idea what's going

1122
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,521
to happen in this vote tonight.

1123
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,315
I did not perform well in the

1124
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,316
puzzle, I don't think.

1125
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,650
You know, I couldn't get with

1126
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,651
the program.

1127
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,277
I kind of felt like dead weight

1128
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,195
to the team.

1129
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,197
So, for all I know, they could

1130
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,699
be voting me out.

1131
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,950
Well, sorry about my performance

1132
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:38,284
on the puzzle.

1133
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,411
I couldn't figure that thing out

1134
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,455
to save my life today.

1135
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,456
>> Yeah.

1136
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,457
>> I'm trying to concentrate on

1137
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,583
putting it behind me.

1138
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,711
Hope tomorrow's a brighter day.

1139
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,301
>> Okay.

1140
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,721
>> Okay, these are the two

1141
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,722
options.

1142
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,765
Now, I've been thinking about

1143
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,766
this.

1144
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,308
Natalie, for sure... or...

1145
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,143
>> Yeah?

1146
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,144
>> ...Jaison.

1147
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,229
>> I know.

1148
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,648
>> Now listen why.

1149
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,774
>> He's been dragging his feet

1150
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,359
lately.

1151
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,528
Yeah.

1152
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,284
Yeah, go back.

1153
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,371
>> With tonight's Tribal

1154
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,206
Council, my survivor stock has

1155
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,083
gone up because I certainly

1156
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,167
thought the vote would be

1157
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,794
between me and Natalie, just

1158
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,462
because we're physically, you

1159
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,005
know, smaller, weaker, than the

1160
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,173
three guys, but I guess,

1161
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,342
strategically, you know, it may

1162
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,677
make more sense for Jaison to

1163
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,053
go, and I'm actually quite

1164
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,263
thrilled because I never would

1165
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,392
have anticipated that.

1166
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,188
>> You know, I got a decision

1167
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,314
to make.

1168
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,399
It's going to have to be either

1169
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,985
Liz or Jaison.

1170
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,736
The thing is, with Liz, I don't

1171
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,320
know if we can trust her once

1172
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,321
the merge happens.

1173
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,907
But the thing is with Jaison, I

1174
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,449
still think I can trust the

1175
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,451
guy, but, you know, we still

1176
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,995
got to think about winning in

1177
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,913
challenges.

1178
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,497
We're losing with the team we

1179
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,248
have.

1180
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:07,832
We've got to find some way to

1181
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,083
win.

1182
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:12,211
Something has to give.

1183
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,447
>> PROBST: Well, there's no use

1184
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,448
going over the dismal facts.

1185
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,491
Losing eight out of ten

1186
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,076
challenges, or the fact that

1187
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,244
after tonight, you'll be down to

1188
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,329
four members, while Galu holds

1189
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,414
strong at eight.

1190
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,790
One of the worst overall

1191
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,959
performances of any tribe in

1192
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,628
the history of the game.

1193
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,088
Natalie, what I want to know is,

1194
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,840
where is the attitude on this

1195
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,841
tribe?

1196
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,967
Still hanging in there?

1197
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:00,468
>> Absolutely.

1198
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,929
It doesn't do any good, uh, to

1199
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,514
get negative, so we have to go

1200
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,350
in to any challenge with our

1201
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,143
heads up, because if we don't,

1202
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,145
then we're done, so...

1203
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:12,313
>> PROBST: Russell, do you still

1204
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,023
wake up every morning and think,

1205
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,191
today's the day?

1206
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,068
>> Yup, every morning.

1207
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,195
All we really can do is hope for

1208
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,905
the merge 'cause they outplayed

1209
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:21,906
us.

1210
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,240
They're outlasting us.

1211
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,492
But one thing I promise you--

1212
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,785
them kids over there-- there's

1213
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,327
no way in hell that they can

1214
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,246
outwit me.

1215
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,831
>> PROBST: Liz, if you get to a

1216
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,875
merge, do you trust these guys?

1217
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,293
>> Absolutely.

1218
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,128
There is no doubt.

1219
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:36,587
After all these Tribal

1220
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,422
Councils, I absolutely trust

1221
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,591
each and every one of these

1222
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,426
people up here with me 100%.

1223
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,054
>> PROBST: Mick, any doubt in

1224
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:45,888
your mind about the

1225
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,514
trustworthiness of this group

1226
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,599
of people?

1227
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,810
>> Honestly, Jeff, none.

1228
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:51,978
The performance aspect-- we

1229
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:52,561
haven't done great, obviously.

1230
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,772
But there's still a social game

1231
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,857
to be played, and that trust is

1232
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,525
at the absolute core of our

1233
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,485
survival, and we all know that.

1234
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,362
>> PROBST: So, Russell, being

1235
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,073
this tight, got to be hard to

1236
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,450
vote somebody out again tonight.

1237
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,493
>> It is very hard.

1238
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,121
You know, five people down to

1239
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,163
four people.

1240
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,248
You know, it almost seems

1241
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,457
hopeless, but if we can just

1242
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,042
keep that four together, then

1243
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,712
you'll see.

1244
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,713
You'll see exactly...

1245
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,048
The whole thing's gonna change.

1246
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:21,674
>> PROBST: Jaison, since we got

1247
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,759
here, you've been like this all

1248
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,802
night.

1249
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,345
Occasionally popping your head

1250
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,471
up.

1251
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,723
What's the hardest part about

1252
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,724
this for you?

1253
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,017
>> I am frustrated with losing,

1254
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,600
is really what I'm frustrated

1255
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,435
about.

1256
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,812
And I actually do feel like I

1257
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,313
have some large responsibility

1258
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,356
in these losses.

1259
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,358
You know, today in the puzzle.

1260
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,694
You know, I feel like Mick did

1261
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,695
a really good job figuring out

1262
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,738
what the pattern was.

1263
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,864
I think Liz had the pattern

1264
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,406
going, but I just couldn't

1265
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,658
figure out how to see the

1266
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:51,037
pattern at my end, and so, I

1267
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,122
don't feel like I performed at

1268
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,665
a level at which I should have.

1269
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,292
>> PROBST: So if you're voted

1270
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,918
out tonight based on today's

1271
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:02,465
performance, would it be fair?

1272
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,924
>> If they decide that, you

1273
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,885
know, my performance today

1274
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,595
warrants me to walk away, I hope

1275
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,139
that that is what is necessary

1276
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,516
for them to win tomorrow.

1277
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,851
>> PROBST: All right, it is

1278
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,102
time to vote.

1279
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,397
Mick, you're up.

1280
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:29,116
>> This is totally strategic

1281
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,493
and not at all personal.

1282
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,662
Sorry.

1283
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:52,973
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1284
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,602
votes.

1285
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,445
Once the votes are read, the

1286
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,531
decision is final.

1287
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,032
Person voted out will be asked

1288
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,408
to leave the Tribal Council area

1289
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:11,700
immediately.

1290
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,620
I'll read the votes.

1291
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:18,541
First vote-- Jaison.

1292
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:22,962
Liz.

1293
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,338
One vote-- Jaison, one vote--

1294
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,008
Liz.

1295
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:28,676
Liz.

1296
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,928
That's two votes Liz, one vote

1297
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,140
Jaison.

1298
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,599
Sixth person voted out of

1299
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,600
<i>Survivor: Samoa--</i> Liz.

1300
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,601
That's three. That's enough.

1301
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,728
You need to bring me your

1302
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,729
torch.

1303
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,858
>> Good luck, guys.

1304
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,322
>> PROBST: Liz, the tribe has

1305
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,326
spoken.

1306
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,454
Time for you to go.

1307
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,044
Well, you haven't been very

1308
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,045
successful at challenges, but

1309
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,088
you're getting really good at

1310
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,089
blindsides.

1311
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:07,715
Grab your torches, head back to

1312
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,549
camp.

1313
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,634
Good night.

1314
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,651
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1315
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,321
from our next episode.

1316
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,243
>> PROBST: Next time on

1317
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,287
<i>Survivor.</i>

1318
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,288
(indistinct chatter, cheering)

1319
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,289
>> To our new tribe.

1320
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,290
>> New tribe.

1321
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,291
(whooping)

1322
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,292
>> All of a sudden, all hell

1323
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,293
breaks loose.

1324
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,294
>> Monica needs to go home

1325
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,421
tonight.

1326
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,507
>> It's Erik 100%.

1327
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,509
>> I got to do what I got to do.

1328
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,509
Things are going to get crazy

1329
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,637
tomorrow out here.

1330
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,226
>> This experience was...

1331
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,728
It was nothing but intense.

1332
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,230
My tribe mates outwitted me.

1333
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,065
It was a very strategic move,

1334
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,942
and the tables turned so quickly

1335
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:08,734
that, you know, it's a little

1336
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:09,777
bit surprising, but kudos to

1337
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,778
them.

1338
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,821
I really, really hope that they

1339
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,864
make it to the end.

1340
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:14,657
And this is one hell of a game,

1341
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,493
so I'm glad I made it as far as

1342
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,620
I did.
