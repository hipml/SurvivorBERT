>> JEFF PROBST: Tonight, we'll

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,468
take a deeper look into the

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:16,391
adventure of a lifetime.

4
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,475
The castaways have endured

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,602
the mental...

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:26,359
...the physical, and

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,278
the emotional toll of battle.

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,326
This is the first 27 days of

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,704
<i>Survivor: Samoa.</i>

10
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,499
Survivors ready?

11
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,292
Go!

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,710
On the battlefield, Galu was a

13
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,085
powerhouse.

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,005
Galu wins immunity!

15
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:47,297
Galu wins!

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,173
Galu wins!

17
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,091
While Foa Foa paid the price.

18
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,428
The tribe has spoken.

19
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,013
But a twist in the game...

20
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,055
>> I'm going to send my girl

21
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:56,681
Shambo.

22
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,724
>> Excuse me?

23
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,349
>> PROBST: ...sent Shambo to Foa

24
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,893
Foa's camp.

25
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,895
>> I'll take a group hug.

26
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:02,687
>> We'd like to adopt her.

27
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,313
I mean, she has just such great

28
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,147
energy.

29
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,691
>> PROBST: While Shambo spread

nothing but chaos.

32
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,863
>> I'm telling you the truth.

33
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,530
You're telling me I'm not

34
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:12,781
honest?

35
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,365
You come up to me and threaten

36
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,075
me, you got to go.

37

>> PROBST: The tribe has

38
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,912
spoken.

39
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,121
He tore his camp apart

40
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,289
to find the hidden immunity

41
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,082
idol.

42
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,667
>> In the history of<i> Survivor,</i>

43
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,002
How many people found the idol

44
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,837
without a clue?

45
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,298
Boo-yah!

46
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,633
>> PROBST: Then Mother Nature

47
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,009
pushed the castaways to their

00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,093
breaking point.

49
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,138
>> You need to sit down?

50
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,556

53
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,353
Russell, Russell, wake up, mate.

want them to do.

gained the trust of the Galu

Welcome to<i> Survivor: Samoa.</i>

impressions to rely on, they

115

began the game by electing

chiefs for their two tribes.

117
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,548
The better-looking Lennox Lewis.

118
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,924
All right, Russell is the

119
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,342
leader of Galu.

120
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,302

Foa Foa.

124
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,559
It is Mick.

Galu camp, Russell's style of

130
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,402
leadership received a positive

131
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,237
following.

132
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,739

>> PROBST: And some early

136
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,286
alliances were formed.

You're my leader so my role is

00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,539
to be your protector.

140
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,125
Just to make life a little bit

141
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:34,709
easier...

142
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,252
>> that makes it a lot easier.

143

>> 'Cause if they go for you,

144
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:37,795
they have to go through me.

145
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,380
I think Russell is a fantastic

146
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,715
leader and I love the fact that

147
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,716
I'm notched right next to him.

148
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,467
I don't have it make any

149
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,134
decisions.

150
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,218
I get to do all the dirty work.

151
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:44,886
I wouldn't have it any

152
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,888
other way.

153
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:47,889
If you're not the leader the

154
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,098
next best thing is to be the

155
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,100
triggerman.

156
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:51,601
I'm here to work for you.

157
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,019
That's my job.

158
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,062
>> Right, right.

159
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,146
If I have one opportunity to

160
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,689
protect you, then I did my job.

161
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,690
He's the main guy.

162
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,649
He's the big boss.

163
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,234
I'm the guy behind the guy that

164
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,444
you need to watch out for.

165
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,028
'Cause if you come to Russell,

166
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:02,612
you're going to mess with me

167
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,156
first.

>> PROBST: At Foa Foa, Mick was

169
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,284
hesitant to call the shots and

170
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,036
his passive guidance was sourly

171
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,162
noted.

172
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,497
>> Where were you thinking of

173
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,539
putting it?

174
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,707
Where, with the...?

175
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,500
>> Uh, well...

176
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:15,917
>> Was it decided?

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,044
>> Ben, what do you think, man?

178
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,253
>> Yeah, we should just build

179
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:19,796
it, like, simple and try to

180
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,173
build it as sturdy as possible.

181
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,382
>> As soon as Jeff said we

182
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:23,966
needed to choose a leader, the

183
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,384
first thing that went through

184
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:25,968
my head was just let me stay

185
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,553
under the radar.

186
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,223
And so the first thing I did

187
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,933
was to get rid of this and just

188
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,935
hang it up.

189
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,269
Are we biting off more than we

190
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,145
can chew?

191
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:36,646
What do you think?

192
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,188
I mean, have you done this?

193
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,272
>> I haven't done this.

194
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,232
>> my approach was kind of to

195
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,109
be like, what, do you think

196
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:41,484
needs to be done?"

197
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,986
I don't want to make it a "Ask

198
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,737
me what to do, I'm going to

199
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,322
tell you."

200
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:46,906
I think that's a little bit

201
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:47,907
dangerous right now.

202
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,075
>> I don't know, do you think we

203
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,159
should do water yet, or wait

204
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:50,576
until tomorrow?

205
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,286
I mean, not that we...

206
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:52,703
>> He's going to...

207
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,206
I don't if we need, but it

208
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,415
wouldn't hurt, you know?

209
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,542
Yeah, I think...

210
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,460
(sighs)

211
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,963
Yeah, well...

212
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,090
Um.

213
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,009
>> The captain leader, Mick,

214
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,552
he's doing a very bad job.

215
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,928
He sucks.

216
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,263
He can't even talk to anybody

217
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,306
hardly.

218
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,932
He's not organized.

219
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,142
He's not a leader.

220
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,560
You know, he doesn't know how

221
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,812
to make good decisions.

222
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,522
The camp's a piece of crap,

223
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,440
but, hey, I say good job

224
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,608
because I don't want to do

225
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:22,859
nothing.

226
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,485
I didn't come here to work.

227
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:24,902
I came here to play.

228
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,405
We is can have something, like,

229
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:27,822
a secret alliance.

230
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,490
>> Okay.

231
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,658
>> PROBST: Russell's strategic

232
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,118
maneuvering was always one step

233
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:32,535
ahead of his tribe.

234
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,703
>> My tribe will believe

235
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,122
anything I tell them at any

236
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,332
point because they're just

237
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,834
stupid.

238
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,793
You can call me the puppet

239
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,961
master.

240
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,337
They can be my little puppets.

241
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,380
They'll run when I tell them to

242
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,381
run.

243
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,299
They'll walk when I tell them

244
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,049
to walk.

245
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:47,967
When I'm finished with them,

246
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,926
I'll just throw them in the

247
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,053
trash.

248
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,264
>> PROBST: Under the cover of

249
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,391
night, Russell wreaked havoc on

250
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,393
his unsuspecting tribe.

251
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:57,935
>> I plan on making it as

252
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,313
miserable as possible for

253
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:00,646
everybody.

254
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,691
>> I think if I can control how

255
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,527
they feel, I can control how

256
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,279
they think.

257
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:08,905
I'm going to do everything it

258
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,656
takes to win this game.

259
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,825
>> I would prefer to have

260
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,743
someone next to me because it's

261
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,912
so cold.

262
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,246
Russell, you want to come sleep

263
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,289
next to me?

264
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,040
>> Yeah.

265
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:19,790
>> Okay.

266
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,627
>> It's funny how any girl at

267
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,338
any level will cuddle with you

268
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,381
at night because it's freezing

269
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:27,882
out here, and it is very

270
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:37,475
strategic.

271
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,310
If you're cuddling with them

272
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,394
and you're rubbing their leg or

273
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:40,937
their arm, they think, "I've

274
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,480
got this guy.

275
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,731
I got him where I want him."

276
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,483
You know what?

277
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,318
If they think they got you,

278
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,694
they'll keep you along for the

279
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,613
ride because they think, "He

280
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,614
really likes me.

281
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,115
Let's not get rid of him

282
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,784
because no way he's going to

283
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,244
vote me out."

284
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,328
You can have that in your back

285
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,371
pocket without having an

286
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,372
alliance with them.

287
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,749
By the way, I'm happily married.

288
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,667
>> And I have the best

289
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,626
boyfriend in the world.

290
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,044
>> You guys cuddle like you've

291
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,171
been married for ten years.

292
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,966
>> This is a game we're playing.

293
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,633
You're supposed to lie, cheat,

294
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,385
and steal.

295
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,469
That's how it works.

296
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,596
What I do out here, my ma's

297
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,639
going to probably be pretty

298
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,056
damn embarrassed.

299
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:17,765
My wife is probably going to be

300
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,518
pissed off.

301
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,102
I love my kids, my wife with

302
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,062
all my heart.

303
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,146
I wouldn't do nothing to hurt

304
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,147
my family.

305
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,357
Everything I do out here is

306
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,899
playing the game.

307
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,234
Every single thing I do is

308
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,361
strategic, everything.

309
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,326
>> PROBST: The Galu tribe

310
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,244
continued to better their

311
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:38,661
living quarters.

312
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,161
>> We can also, like, make

313
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,496
baskets...

314
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,164
He's a hairdresser!

315
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,207
>> PROBST: And while the younger

316
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,417
women easily connected with each

317
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,960
other, Shambo was left on the

318
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,420
outs.

319
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:47,670
>> Wow.

320
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,839
You know what we're going

321
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,089
to need?

322
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,008
What we need one of you guys to

323
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,468
do is we need a palm frond

324
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:54,885
split up the middle.

325
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,721
We need a really leafy one like

326
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:56,929
that.

327
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,638
>> It's definitely a social

328
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,764
awkwardness that she has with

329
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,766
everybody.

330
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,227
She just doesn't get when she

331
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,562
does something that annoys

332
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,564
people, she just doesn't get it.

333
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,065
>> We can actually go collect

334
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,984
coconuts and mangos and bananas

335
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:10,901
and fruit.

336
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,611
>> She's 45 years old and you'd

337
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,113
think by that time you'd get

338
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,990
how to interact with people,

339
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,700
and that frustrates me because

340
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,411
I don't even like to--

341
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,746
be around her.

342
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,122
>> Just throw the fronds up

343
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,583
there as long as they overlap.

344
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,168
>> I've never spent a lot of

345
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,961
time with somebody like Shambo.

346
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:29,712
The overt aggression, and the

347
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,048
overt tomboyish behavior I

348
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,840
think puts a lot of people off,

349
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,717
especially when you have pretty

350
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,719
girls here.

351
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,262
Like, the hot chicks we have

352
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:38,888
around here aren't as likely to

353
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,890
connect with Shambo who just is

354
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,350
a brute.

355
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:42,892
There's no way you can get

356
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,101
around that.

357
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,228
It's in your face 24/seven.

358
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,025
(laughter)

359
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:51,859
I just keep going.

360
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,986
What is it, mullet?

361
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,574
>> PROBST: At Foa Foa, Russell

362
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,909
had no intention of providing

363
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,078
for his tribe.

364
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,125
>> You know, I eat one papaya

365
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,335
a day.

366
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,170
They lucky if they get a

367
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,130
little bitty piece.

368
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,965
I'm not their daddy.

369
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,800
I'm not gonna bring them

370
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,676
food.

371
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,803
They're not my babies.

372
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,596
We're out here to win a

373
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,013
million dollars.

374
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,473
It's right there in their face.

375
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,433
All they got to do is look up

376
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,476
and it's right there.

377
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:25,976
It's all over the place.

378
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,312
So I'm gonna just keep

379
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,065
eating, and if I find out that

380
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,108
somebody knows about my spot,

381
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,443
I'm voting them out. (chuckles)

382
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,949
>> What is that?

383
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,741
>> PROBST: But he wasn't the

384
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:45,204
only castaway dining in secret.

385
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,917
>> Oh, that's good. Mmm.

386
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,428
>> Lookit, let's eat

387
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,138
a little bit.

388
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,974
>> Mmm, this is delicious.

389
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,938
>> Cheers, guys.

390
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,606
>> Oh, my God! Cheers.

391
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,023
>> Nice work.

392
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:13,607
>> Yeah, baby.

393
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:13,983
>> Nice work.

394
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,025
>> Hell, yeah, I'm so glad.

395
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,778
>> Sweet, huh?

396
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,447
>> This is so great.

397
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,573
>> Yeah, the ripe ones

398
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:20,948
are beautiful.

399
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,241
>> It goes down and then stops.

400
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,784
And it feels so good.

401
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,995
>> Oh!

402
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:26,996
(laughter)

403
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:27,371
>> I'm in heaven!

404
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,373
>> I know.

405
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,252
>> No.

406
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,253
>> Okay, good.

407
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:34,795
>> What papaya?

408
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,673
(laughter)

409
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,967
>> That's what I'm talking

410
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,926
about!

411
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,262
Let's go.

412
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,266
Let's do this.

413
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,768
(sing-songy): I'm not sharing.

414
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,020
>> PROBST: After winning the

415
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,481
first immunity challenge, Galu

416
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,483
took home flint.

417
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,487
>> A big ol' mound full of it.

418
00:12:59,570 --> 00:12:59,862
>> Yeah!

419
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,322
>> Give it a little blow.

420
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,364
No, not from above.

421
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,115
From the side.

422
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,408
>> No, no, no, no, no, hush.

423
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,910
You guys shut up, please.

424
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,453
Don't blow.

425
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,873
Like fireworks, isn't it? Damn.

426
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,459
>> When we were making fire it

427
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,043
was pretty frustrating because

428
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,504
Shambo really wanted to be the

429
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,630
one to make fire.

430
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,548
The problem, is Shambo doesn't

431
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,550
really know how to make fire.

432
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,092
>> There we go, there we go,

433
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,261
there we go, there we go.

434
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,262
>> Now you blow lightly,

435
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:25,596
very lightly.

436
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,056
>> Just don't let that go out.

437
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,389
Keep it covered.

438
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,682
Keep it covered here.

439
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,726
It's all right, it's all right.

440
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,185
>> Man, I'm exhausted.

441
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,019
>> It's okay.

442
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,021
>> There have been several

443
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:34,897
times when I just want to go,

444
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,691
"What? Did your mom drop you on

445
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,108
your head?"

446
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:38,901
Because that is not the correct

447
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,320
way to do it, not even a

448
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,446
smart way to do it.

449
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,198
>> Do you, you want to hit some

450
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:44,532
flint on here?

451
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,617
>> I would love to take a crack

452
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,910
at it, but I would very much

453
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,620
like to be in charge for the

454
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,663
time I am doing it.

455
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:50,996
>> Whatever.

456
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,289
Now you're pissing me off.

457
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,207
Okay, let's not have

458
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:53,582
a conversation.

459
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,833
>> Cool. No problem.

460
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,292
>> I'm serious.

461
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:55,918
>> Where's that machete?

462
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,086
>> Oh, sorry.

463
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,170
>> Don't be sorry.

464
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,964
Just don't let if happen again.

465
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,882
>> Hey, Dave, be my hero, man.

466
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,551
>> Dude, what are you doing?

467
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,635
There is no wind.

468
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,303
That's why you build a fire pit.

469
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,721
>> Dave looks like he knows what

470
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,430
he's doing.

471
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,014
I have faith that he's gonna

472
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,891
make this happen, so let's

473
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,102
just let it happen.

474
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,895
>> Dave's just a complete and

475
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,897
utter moron.

476
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,899
He won't take assistance or

477
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,735
help from anybody for anything.

478
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,278
Nothing in my life has ever

479
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:22,987
operated without teamwork, so

480
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,364
it just hit me the wrong way,

481
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,366
you know.

482
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,701
I have to constantly remind

483
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,285
myself, "You're not at home,

484
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,286
"Shannon.

485
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,288
This isn't your family."

486
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:32,997
>> There we go, there we go,

487
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,790
there we go.

488
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,208
>> I want everybody to back off.

489
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,167
>> Oh, yeah. It's going.

490
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,627
It's igniting. Oh, my gosh.

491
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,712
>> Wait on it.

492
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,879
>> Back off that.

493
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,672
No, it's all good.

494
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,006
It's all good

495
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,466
>> It's going.

496
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,594
Russell, we got this for

497
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:46,969
you, baby.

498
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,928
>> Shh-shh-shh!

499
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,971
>> Fire, you guys!

500
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,349
>> My awesomeness, it speaks

501
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:52,641
for itself.

502
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,310
I'm the provider.

503
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,103
I'm the fire maker.

504
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,606
So I am pretty much

505
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,691
bulletproof, I think.

506
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,157
>> Really?

507
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,158
>> I mean if it got down

508
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,910
down to he or I at the end

509
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,329
somewhere and that was the only

510
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,164
ammo I had against him, of

511
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,834
course I'd use it.

512
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,424
>> PROBST: On day five, the

513
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,178
adrenaline surged as the tribes

514
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,137
pushed each other to the limits.

515
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,056
>> You got it, Ashley!

516
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,766
>> PROBST: Erik with

517
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,558
an underhand.

518
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,728
Galu wins reward and immunity!

519
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,355
After another Foa Foa loss,

520
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,774
lessons from Jaison's past came

521
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:47,655
back to haunt him.

522
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,197
All right, Galu...

523
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,990
>> Before, before you move,

524
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,450
I want to say something.

525
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:51,825
>> PROBST: Yes.

526
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,577
>> I want to play within the

527
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,371
rules and I want to try to be a

528
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,121
sportsman, but if someone is

529
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,082
gonna try and elbow me, I'm

530
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,376
coming for 'em, and that's the

531
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,752
way it's gonna go down.

532
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,294
So, hey, I'm gonna try to

533
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,003
say the right thing.

534
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:03,837
Congratulations, Galu, good

535
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,214
job, but I'm coming for John in

536
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,216
the next one.

537
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,092
I'm coming for him.

538
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,177
I had a lot of emotions going

539
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,804
today after that thing was over.

540
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,514
It just brought up a lot of

541
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,848
stuff from the past that have

542
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,766
really been the motivating

543
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,476
factor for why I try to succeed

544
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,478
so much in life.

545
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,355
I don't know who John is, but I

546
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,274
know guys like this, guys who

547
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,026
get ahead by not playing

548
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,945
by the rules.

549
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,655
>> I just got one short, sweet:

550
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,949
that was a beautiful, amazing

551
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:32,366
competition.

552
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,200
The only thing that I'm really

553
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,327
disheartened about is

554
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,578
I'm coming for you."

555
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,913
Jaison, let's leave the blood

556
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:38,580
on the battlefield.

557
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,915
Nobody needs to get hurt.

558
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:41,041
>> Say the same thing to your

559
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,209
teammate over there and then

560
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,585
it'll all be good.

561
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:43,919
>> Okay, stop.

562
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,587
>> I should not have said what I

563
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,922
said to John, period.

564
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,090
My dad grew up in rural

565
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,633
Mississippi, got kicked off his

566
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,217
land by the Klan, graduated

567
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,469
with honors from Long Beach

568
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,762
State, and got a Ph.D

569
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,680
from Stanford.

570
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,806
And all the while he didn't

571
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,181
complain.

572
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,141
He didn't moan.

573
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,142
He just shut up and he got up

574
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,644
earlier the next day and he went

575
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,604
out and won.

576
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,897
And every time that

577
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,107
say something like that, I feel

578
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,734
like I let him down because

579
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,276
that's not what I'm supposed

580
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,820
to be doing, and I am more

581
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,404
disappointed in myself right

582
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,157
now than anybody else out there.

583
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,409
>> PROBST: Galu, back-to-back

584
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,076
immunity wins.

585
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,578
>> Whoo!

586
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,288
>> I just feel like I have

587
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,080
something to prove,

588
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,248
and I think that's why I came

589
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,666
out here.

590
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,834
I came out here to prove

591
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,209
something.

592
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,961
I need to win, not just survive

593
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,379
or make it to the next round.

594
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:36,013
I need to win.

595
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,723
>> PROBST: On day nine, Shambo

596
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,307
had accidentally let loose one

597
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,769
of Galu's hard-earned chickens.

598
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,103
(chickens clucking, crowing)

599
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,313
By day 12, as the chicken

600
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,231
continued to elude capture...

601
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,152
...it became a personal quest

602
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,488
for Erik.

603
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:52,780
>> Chicken.

604
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,197
>> Over there.

605
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,199
(chicken clucking)

606
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,125
>> Is that it?

607
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,879
>> At this point, I think it's

608
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:09,505
more personal with Erik and the

609
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,130
the chicken.

610
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,925
I think that he has to beat

611
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,260
that chicken.

612
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:29,107
(clucking)

613
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,276
(squawking)

614
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,205
(Erik grunting)

615
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,332
(chicken squawking)

616
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,588
>> Damn it!

617
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,172
That chicken's fast.

618
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,467
(panting)

619
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,302
Advantage chicken.

620
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,847
At least this time, I didn't

621
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,098
clothesline myself.

622
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,474
(clucking)

623
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,980
(thunder crashing)

624
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,440
>> PROBST: On night 14,

625
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,608
huddling together through the

626
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,194
cold and the rain, Russell

627
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,988
almost spilled the beans about

628
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,031
his personal fortune.

629
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,491
>> This sucks.

630
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,158
(laughter)

631
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,660
I wish I had on rain clothes.

632
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,036
>> So, at this point, would

633
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,996
anything make y'all quit

634
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:30,377
right now?

635
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,339
I'm really a multimillionaire.

636
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,216
I own an oil company in

637
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,801
Houston, and that's how stupid

638
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,803
these people really are.

639
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,345
They think that I'm some

640
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,681
redneck from the South that

641
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,473
can't do anything.

642
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,600
Well, you know what?

643
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm the richest man here.

644
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,231
>> No. What are you gonna talk

645
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,483
about, Russell?

646
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,776
>> It's obviously something if

647
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,194
he won't tell, but hey...

648
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,112
>> I know.

649
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,280
>> Russell seems pretty solid.

650
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,781
He's got that kind of Southern

651
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,407
charm going on, he's got kids.

652
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,618
You want to trust the, like,

653
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,785
kind of Southern family guy

654
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,912
thing, but maybe that's his

655
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,914
his shtick.

656
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,332
>> Does it really look like I'm

657
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:08,665
a millionaire?

658
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,001
I'm playing all these people

659
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:11,293
like fools.

660
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,420
There is a difference between

661
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,922
book smarts and common sense

662
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:15,297
smarts.

663
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,215
It seems like none in my

664
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,550
group has any common sense, not

665
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,093
a one of them.

666
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,721
But it's definitely not gonna

667
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,056
catch up with me here 'cause

668
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,682
I'm tell nobody until the end.

669
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,645
(laughs)

670
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,979
>> PROBST: The next morning,

671
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,606
Mick still had doubts about

672
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,775
Russell's honesty.

673
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,838
>> Boo-yah!

674
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,589
(both laugh)

675
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,298
>> I knew you did, man.

676
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,801
I knew there was something...

677
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,765
>> Really?

678
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,391
Nice, man. Good for you.

679
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,309
>> Mick is a good guy.

680
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,228
If I tell Mick that I have

681
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,146
money, he's gonna think he

682
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,690
can trust me even more.

683
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,650
I mean, if I would have thought

684
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,026
that Mick would say anything

685
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,695
about what I do for a living,

686
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,321
then I wouldn't have told him.

687
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,364
I was living in a trailer check-

688
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,450
by-check five years ago.

689
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,913
>> Russell's a pretty savvy

690
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,248
guy, so it doesn't really

691
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:31,748
surprise me.

692
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,541
I think we sort of, you know,

693
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,417
bonded a little bit.

694
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,544
I told him what I really

695
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,169
did, too.

696
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,171
And so I think it was kind of a

697
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,339
show of trust on both sides

698
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,799
Because I can be judged based

699
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,009
on, you know, my potential

700
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:42,884
earning income as well.

701
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,094
You know, physicians still do

702
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:44,469
pretty well.

703
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,013
We're not murdering it like we

704
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:46,221
used to.

705
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,764
But could somebody use that

706
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:48,432
against me?

707
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:48,724
Absolutely.

708
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,684
But, uh, you know, if it got

709
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,352
down to he or I at the end

710
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,895
somewhere and that was the only

711
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,272
ammo I had against him, of

712
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,606
course I'd use it.

713
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,070
>> We're trying to take you

714
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,030
deep into this game.

715
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,531
>> I resent the fact that you

716
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,868
guys are taking<i> me</i> way into it.

717
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:08,660
... you guys?

718
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,828
>> Okay, I appreciate that.

719
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,537
>> That's my pride.

720
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,582
The tribe of Galu is going to

721
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,917
take me deep into the game.

722
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,502
Oh, I'm so appreciative.

723
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,672
These people can kiss my ass.

724
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,262
>> PROBST: On day 19

725
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,472
the tribes merged on

726
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,723
the Galu beach.

727
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,851
( cheers and applause )

728
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,352
>> Foa Foa, they think that

729
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,353
they're going to strategize and

730
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:35,771
make friends.

731
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,355
What's Samoan for "Get the hell

732
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,649
off my island"?

733
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,319
Nobody talks to Shambo, period.

734
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:42,694
>>Perfect.

735
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,361
>> Let her...

736
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,488
>> PROBST: The original Galu

737
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,447
men agreed to keep the details

738
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,950
from their ally Shambo, but

739
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,577
she wasn't in the mood to be

740
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,995
kept in the dark.

741
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,496
>> What else is new?

742
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,123
>> Uh, I was told not to tell.

743
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:55,624
Is that going to be okay?

744
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,293
Are you going to be mad at me?

745
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,087
>> I'm not gonna be mad at you

746
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,171
I think it's enough.

747
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,714
I mean, I'm not seven, and

748
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,965
that's how I'm being treated.

749
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:04,466
>> How could I make you

750
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,884
feel better?

751
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,968
>> (scoffs) Give me a

752
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:07,302
direct answer.

753
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,637
Make your own decision, Dave,

754
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,639
whatever.

755
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,224
>> Okay. I'd like to burn Shambo

756
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,892
right now just to get her out of

757
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:14,518
my hair, but she's too valuable

758
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,520
to our alliance so we're gonna

759
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,063
keep her around and just deal

760
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,231
with it, um, even though

761
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:19,731
I think she's dangerous

762
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,608
because she is unpredictable.

763
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,193
You don't know what she's gonna

764
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,903
do, but the boys assure me we

765
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:25,529
can control her, so I'm, like,

766
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:33,662
"All right. Time will tell."

767
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,871
>> It makes people worry

768
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,497
that you will flip out, okay?

769
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,165
>> That's-that's fair.

770
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,083
But you know what?

771
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,251
>> All right? They're, they're

772
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,335
afraid that you're gonna

773
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,044
flip out.

774
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,087
>> I haven't flipped out

775
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,754
I haven't done...

776
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,089
I've been bossy around camp.

777
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,132
I let the chicken go.

778
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,133
I lost the snorkel.

779
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,300
>> We're trying to take you

780
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:47,717
deep into this game.

781
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,302
We're concerned that you will

782
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,096
accidentally say something, and

783
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,098
I want to you relax and know

784
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,808
that we're taking you way

785
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,351
into this.

786
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,854
And I don't want there to be

787
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,188
any problems.

788
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,190
>> I resent the fact that<i> you</i>

789
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,193
<i>guys</i> are taking<i> me</i> way into it?

790
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,444
<i>You guys?</i>

791
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:06,987
>> Okay I appreciate that.

792
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,321
>> That's my pride.

793
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:08,864
>> I apologize.

794
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,364
You're absolutely right.

795
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,699
That was, that was unfair.

796
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,577
>> You know, I'm-I'm nobody's

797
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,828
ninny, or "Shambo, we're gonna

798
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,996
let you be number eight."

799
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,289
... you guys.

800
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,499
>> No, no, no, no.

801
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,834
All right, now watch out.

802
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,459
>> No.

803
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,711
>> I see your feelings, all

804
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,129
right, and I'm trying to help.

805
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:24,713
>> Dave was, like, "I can tell

806
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,714
"you that we're gonna carry

807
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,216
"you along in this game as long

808
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,051
"as we can, but we can't tell

809
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,469
"you what's going on because you

810
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,637
can't be trusted."

811
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,555
I'm like, "Dude, ... you.

812
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,432
What am I, seven?

813
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,100
I don't need you to bring me

814
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,101
along in the game.

815
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:38,643
>> Give me a hug. Come on.

816
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,687
>> I'm not in a huggy mood.

817
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,313
>> Fair enough.

818
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,355
All right, I gotta go

819
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:42,772
get to work.

820
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,064
Are we good?

821
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,316
>> We're good, Dave.

822
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:44,900
>> All right, mama.

823
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,275
>> Thanks, babe.

824
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,568
>> Yep, good job.

825
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,737
>> The tribe of Galu is going

826
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,323
to take me deep into the game.

827
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,825
Oh, I'm so appreciative.

828
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:58,371
These people can kiss my ass.

829
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,623
>> PROBST: The next morning as

830
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:04,085
Shambo licked her wounds, Erik

831
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,671
still had chicken on the brain.

832
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,840
>> In<i> Rocky</i> 2, Rocky wasn't

833
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,427
ready to fight Apollo and win

834
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,721
against Apollo until he was able

835
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,308
to catch that chicken.

836
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,228
(grunts)

837
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,437
Day 20 right now.

838
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,147
Halfway through.

839
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,692
Getting closer to the chicken.

840
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,693
But I don't think I can win

841
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,112
this game and knock Apollo

842
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,156
Creed out until I've caught

843
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,158
that chicken.

844
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,201
(neck cracking)

845
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,078
(chicken clucking)

846
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,432
This isn't the way to

847
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,308
catch this chicken.

848
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:00,809
You got to be smarter than

849
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,186
the chicken, not stronger than

850
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,563
the chicken.

851
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:10,944
I'm gonna take the

852
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,195
fishing net.

853
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:12,696
I'm gonna put it on four

854
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,115
different branches, lock them

855
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,200
down, lift the middle up, tie

856
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,661
it to a branch up top, put some

857
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,038
fishing line on that, and it

858
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,540
will be a giant, like, tent.

859
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,583
Put some coconuts, some trash,

860
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,335
some bugs as kind of like bait.

861
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,378
All right, you locked in?

862
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:28,753
>> Yup.

863
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,921
>> All right, let go.

864
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,466
>> Presumably, the chicken goes

865
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,092
under it, and all he has

866
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,969
to do is go stand next

867
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,429
to those torches, cut a

868
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,264
line, and the thing drops.

869
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,682
>> PROBST: With Erik out

870
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,268
crabbing, it was Shambo

871
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,144
to the rescue.

872
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:44,853
>> Chicken!

873
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,188
(chicken clucking)

874
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,154
(chicken squawking)

875
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,573
>> I got the chicken!

876
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,161
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

877
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,370
>> All right, you got him?

878
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,665
>> Don't you kill my chicken.

879
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,708
>> Nicely done.

880
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,379
>> Erik! Erik!

881
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,839
(chicken squawking)

882
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,424
>> I know. You're okay.

883
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:18,386
(chicken squawking)

884
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,472
(cheers and applause )

885
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,056
>> Oh!

886
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,724
>> My little noogie chicken.

887
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,851
That's the most comforting

888
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,061
feeling that I've had in

889
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,562
probably three weeks was to hold

890
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,605
that little devastated chicken

891
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,565
in my arm, and it needed me and

892
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,108
I needed it, and it was, it was

893
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,110
a good moment.

894
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,111
(clucking)

895
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,154
Hey! Meow!

896
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:36,738
You be nice!

897
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,740
The chicken has returned home,

898
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,909
and the mighty hunter Erik has,

899
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,078
uh...

900
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,079
He's validated.

901
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,080
>> We got the chicken!

902
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,081
>> You got the chicken?

903
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,082
>> Yeah.

904
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,124
>> Yeah.

905
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,125
>> PROBST: Erik returned home

906
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,210
to great news.

907
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:54,089
>> I'm so happy!

908
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,299
>> Oh...

909
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,802
>> Ah!

910
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,928
Yes!

911
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,889
Finally, the trap I set, devised

912
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,724
worked like a charm, and now

913
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,143
that chicken that I stalked,

914
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,604
that in return mocked me for

915
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,772
ten, 12 days-- finally, back

916
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,065
where it belongs in that coop.

917
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,775
>> Yeah, I got to admit, I had

918
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,068
my doubts on the trap, but...

919
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:15,902
>> Dude!

920
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,737
>> There's two chickens in the

921
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,824
freaking coop again, bro.

922
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,578
>> PROBST: Later that night,

923
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,038
Russell was up to his old tricks

924
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,542
with his new tribe.

925
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,794
(clucking)

926
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,798
>> You know, it's time for me to

927
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,676
create the chaos.

928
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,803
I'm in a bind right now, so I

929
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,847
have to get everybody else at

930
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,975
each other's throat.

931
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,771
I decided to open the hatch so

932
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,858
the chickens could get out,

933
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,151
because when they're gone

934
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,153
tomorrow, all hell's gonna break

935
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,154
loose.

936
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,947
It's gonna cause chaos once

937
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,825
again.

938
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,826
Erik was so excited.

939
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,827
"They got the chicken."

940
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,120
(Russell laughs)

941
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,622
He was so excited.

942
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,833
(Russell laughs)

943
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,376
Let's see how he feels when they

944
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,504
lose two chickens.

945
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,966
You know, I want to have a

946
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,968
little bit of fun tonight, so I

947
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,595
get up, and I put the idol

948
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,596
around my neck.

949
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,180
I start looking at everybody

950
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,725
sleeping.

951
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,184
Uh, that's what I do.

952
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,061
I live on the edge.

953
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:38,902
All of a sudden, I see Dave's

954
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,986
up.

955
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,030
I say, "Oh, this is great."

956
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,573
I'm gonna go by Dave, talk to

957
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,700
him.

958
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:48,244
You better be cocky in this

959
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,121
game, because if you're not,

960
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,122
then you're gone.

961
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,249
>> Oh, no.

962
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,211
>> You know what?

963
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,588
'Cause, I, uh...

964
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,009
My impression of Foa Foa is that

965
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,010
they're tired, and they're

966
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,220
scared, and they're holding

967
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,012
together now, but I don't really

968
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,097
care, 'cause we're gonna be able

969
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,098
to knock them off.

970
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,226
Who gives a crap.

971
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,062
>> I thought it was funny that

972
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,104
Dave was sitting there talking

973
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,397
to me, and the idol's sitting

974
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,398
right there.

975
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,942
All he's got to do is look at

976
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,193
it, but he never did.

977
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,486
None of them are thinking really

978
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,487
the game.

979
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,530
They're thinking, get rid of

980
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,739
Foa Foa.

981
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,741
They think they have numbers.

982
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:27,283
They think that, uh, they're

983
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,369
just gonna weed us out one

984
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,370
at a time.

985
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,498
It's not gonna happen.

986
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,210
>> PROBST: Facing Tribal Council

987
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,503
as a newly merged tribe, Erik's

988
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,546
head was suddenly on the

989
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:39,963
chopping block.

990
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,090
>> Everyone's on board?

991
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,051
>> PROBST: And Brett was the

992
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,135
last to know.

993
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,136
>> Hey Brett, Brett?

994
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,137
>> Uh-oh.

995
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,013
>> They say... They say

996
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,056
everybody's on board with Erik.

997
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,183
>> Shh!

998
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,395
>> I'll be completely honest,

999
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,396
'cause you are the people that I

1000
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,397
trust.

1001
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,398
>> Yes.

1002
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,399
>> I know that...

1003
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,400
I hon-honestly don't...

1004
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,401
>> Yes?

1005
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,485
>> I think we should at least

1006
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,486
give it some time to discuss.

1007
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,487
>> No, I think it's...

1008
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,488
>> No. I don't... Jais...

1009
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,073
We don't... It's...

1010
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,950
>> Is this ... done or what?

1011
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:09,951
>> Yes. Shh.

1012
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:10,952
>> We can get him out next time.

1013
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,079
Jaison... Just...

1014
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,542
>> Here he comes.

1015
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,210
>> Okay.

1016
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:24,007
>> All right.

1017
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,133
>> Erik is actually someone that

1018
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,218
I see myself gonna the end of

1019
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,803
the game with, and so for my

1020
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:29,804
alliances essentially saying

1021
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,139
they all want to vote out Erik,

1022
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,432
when he wasn't even discussed at

1023
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,474
all throughout the day, just

1024
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,018
baffles me.

1025
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,019
I don't understand why.

1026
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,020
>> Because...

1027
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,021
>> Because every...

1028
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,022
>> There's...

1029
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,023
>> All of sudden, literally,

1030
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,065
every single person that you

1031
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,108
trust here, besides Erik, every

1032
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,652
single person...

1033
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,653
>> ...but apparently, it's

1034
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,654
already done, and you got to

1035
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,655
get comfortable quick, because

1036
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,698
every single person is voting

1037
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,324
for Erik, so you've got to get

1038
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,074
on the train, because it's

1039
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,075
already left the station.

1040
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,076
>> Yup.

1041
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,077
>> And I'm the same way you

1042
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,873
were.

1043
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:57,874
>> So he's totally not, dude.

1044
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,875
He's banned, dude.

1045
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,917
He's cancer.

1046
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,918
We got to dump him now.

1047
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,130
>> It's already done.

1048
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,131
>> I understand.

1049
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,132
I got 30 seconds with Dave.

1050
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,133
>> Apparently, people have made

1051
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,134
up their minds, but...

1052
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,135
>> Yeah.

1053
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,262
>> ...I have not seen reason.

1054
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,222
>> Yeah, yeah. No, I understand.

1055
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:13,806
>> Obviously, the decision's

1056
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,974
already been made, and, you

1057
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,434
know, there's not a lot I can

1058
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,061
do, and so my plan now is

1059
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,855
basically, just fly under the

1060
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,148
radar for the time being, and I

1061
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,108
think that that will carry me

1062
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,401
through for a while, and then,

1063
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,153
um, I'll need to step it up

1064
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,155
and-and start, you know, making

1065
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,406
a few decisions.

1066
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,534
>> Welcome to<i> Survivor.</i>

1067
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,288
>> PROBST: Reluctantly, Brett

1068
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,122
followed his Galu alliance and

1069
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,208
helped blindside one of their

1070
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,918
own.

1071
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:42,502
Seventh person voted out of

1072
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,169
<i>Survivor: Samoa,</i> and the first

1073
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,212
member of our jury-- Erik.

1074
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,173
>> The vote tonight, I think,

1075
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,134
will shape the rest of the game

1076
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,302
completely, and I hope that

1077
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,637
doesn't screw up my entire game.

1078
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,638
>> PROBST: Erik, the tribe has

1079
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,766
spoken.

1080
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,727
>> (voice breaking): I knew at

1081
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,396
some point I was just gonna

1082
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,480
break down bawling.

1083
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,523
>> Don't work yourself up into

1084
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,692
something that's not there.

1085
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,275
>> Laura and I did not have a

1086
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,069
heart-to-heart conversation in

her little reach out and touch

1088
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,699
me superficial bull...

1089
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,075
Don't make me throw up on your

1090
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:32,051
face.

1091
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,220
>> PROBST: By day 23, the

1092
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,139
emotional burden of the game

1093
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,307
took its toll on Shambo.

1094
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,017
And home was all she could

1095
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:40,727
think about.

1096
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,102
>> I'm Irish.

1097
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,395
I'm not supposed to be in the

1098
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,730
sun.

1099
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,772
>> How many of you are there?

1100
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,106
>> Nine kids.

1101
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,649
My...

1102
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,525
>> Your brother passed away,

1103
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,234
right?

1104
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,193
>> My brother Terry died of

1105
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,111
meningitis when he was about

1106
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,195
three months old.

1107
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,698
And then my sister Donna died of

1108
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,282
cancer the day before her 27th

1109
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,159
birthday.

1110
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,370
>> That's sad.

1111
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,288
>> Well, they're better off.

1112
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,206
>> Was she older or younger was

1113
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,249
she?

1114
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:03,583
She was older?

1115
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,083
>> Donna was older.

1116
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,251
She went through radiation and

1117
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,962
chemotherapy for a long time

1118
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:08,629
and then they told her that she

1119
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,213
was fine and there was no

1120
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,175
traces of cancer.

1121
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,509
She was a newlywed when the

1122
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,719
cancer was found.

1123
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:15,553
>> Oh, you're kidding.

1124
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,345
>> She'd only been married,

1125
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,221
like, 18 months.

1126
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,431
And then she went in for a scan

1127
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,599
and they said it was full-blown

1128
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,767
back.

1129
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,894
>> Oh.

1130
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,736
Oh, Shammy.

1131
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,529
>> I knew at some point I was

1132
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,281
just going to break down

1133
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,408
bawling.

1134
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,661
>> She's really proud of you,

1135
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,789
Sham.

1136
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,292
Guarantee you that one thing.

1137
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:51,923
How old were you?

1138
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,049
>> I was 23.

1139
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:53,674
I was stationed in Okinawa, and

1140
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,177
I remember my staff sergeant

1141
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,514
saying, "Corporal Waters go

1142
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,681
back to the barracks, you got

1143
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,808
an emergency phone call from

1144
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,184
the Red Cross."

1145
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,853
And I just started bawling.

1146
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,939
I was like God dang it.

1147
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,148
Who died?

1148
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,275
Because I didn't know.

1149
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,032
>> Come on.

1150
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,243
Where's our sunshine?

1151
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,079
>> Laura and I did not have a

1152
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,081
heart-to-heart conversation.

1153
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,624
Laura invaded a private moment

1154
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,208
that I was having on the beach

1155
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,461
where I was really homesick.

1156
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,337
I was missing my family, and I

1157
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,380
started think thinking about my

1158
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,298
sister that passed away over 20

1159
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,800
years ago.

1160
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:36,926
I was just, I was pretty much

1161
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,678
broken down and sad, and she

1162
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,763
wanted to play buddy-buddy

1163
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,347
with me.

1164
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,641
And her little "reach out and

1165
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,310
touch me" superficial bull...

1166
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,479
>> Be thankful that you're here.

1167
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,022
We have 20 more days.

1168
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:50,565
>> I feel like the girls out

1169
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,150
here are out to get me.

1170
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,360
>> Well I think you're a lot--

1171
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,695
you're self-paranoid, too.

1172
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,113
I think the more paranoid you

1173
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,115
are, the worse it gets.

1174
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,325
>> I don't think I'm paranoid,

1175
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,202
though, Lolo, I don't.

1176
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,745
>> I'm telling you, you are.

1177
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,913
Don't work yourself up into

1178
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,455
something that's not there.

1179
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,624
>> I can't stand Laura.

1180
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,208
I want no conversations with

1181
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,334
her.

1182
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,253
You don't even like me, and you

1183
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,213
want to sit here and pretend

1184
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,132
like you're befriending me.

1185
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,341
It's just, like don't make me

1186
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,468
throw up on your face.

1187
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,856
>> PROBST: On day 27, Russell

1188
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,440
believed he had it all under

1189
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,067
control, so he began to make

1190
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,861
moves to ensure his safety

1191
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,362
further in the game.

1192
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,031
>> I'm in control of this game.

1193
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,532
Everything has worked for me so

1194
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,450
far.

1195
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,911
I set up my alliance so strong,

1196
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,287
my four people, including me,

1197
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,496
they come up to me.

1198
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,498
They tell me everything.

1199
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,000
And you have to be able to

1200
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:51,626
outwit them, even if it's your

1201
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,627
best alliance.

1202
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,794
You have to be able to outwit

1203
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,796
them, too.

1204
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,465
They're going to turn on you,

1205
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,925
Foa Foa.

1206
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,718
Believe it when I say it.

1207
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,136
I'm the one that's going to

1208
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:02,595
take you.

1209
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,722
They'll get rid of you.

1210
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:06,515
Yeah.

1211
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,350
Who do you think's going to be

1212
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,477
gone first?

1213
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,535
>> It feels really good to be

1214
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,745
aligned with Russell.

1215
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,248
I mean, he is the most powerful

1216
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,291
player in this game.

1217
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,085
He knows that whatever he votes,

1218
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:34,377
I vote, too.

1219
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,587
So really he's got two votes no

1220
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,005
matter what, any way he wants

1221
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,257
to play it.

1222
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,884
It may, you know, mess me up in

1223
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,427
the end, but I've made it this

1224
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,303
far, so, you know, I'm just

1225
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,973
going to trust him, and we'll go

1226
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,557
with it, and I'm hoping that

1227
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,934
I'll be in the final two.

1228
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,352
>> Now, I want to you promise me

1229
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,645
one thing I'll never ask you

1230
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,646
again.

1231
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,647
>> Okay.

1232
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,523
>> When it comes down to brass

1233
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,234
knuckles, and it's just me and

1234
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,568
you and somebody else, you have

1235
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,486
to swear to me you ain't going

1236
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,863
to think that I'm going to beat

1237
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,156
you because I played the game

1238
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,199
better and vote me off.

1239
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:06,200
Swear on Mick.

1240
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,243
You're going to start thinking.

1241
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,286
That's a lot of money.

1242
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:08,869
Your brain's going to start

1243
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:14,458
working.

1244
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,377
>> It's... You know what?

1245
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,004
It's not worth the money to me

1246
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:18,587
to lose my integrity out here.

1247
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,548
If I give you my word, I give

1248
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,009
you my word, and that's the

1249
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:23,968
bottom line.

1250
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:24,969
>> All right.

1251
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,595
You know, it all comes to a head

1252
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,596
sooner or later.

1253
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,597
>> For sure, I agree.

1254
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,808
>> I would think my best partner

1255
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,851
out here would be Natalie.

1256
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,936
You see, Natalie is my ticket to

1257
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,981
get rid of both Jaison and Mick.

1258
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,899
So she can go pretty far in this

1259
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,567
game with me, maybe all the way

1260
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,568
to the final two.

1261
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,361
'Cause who better to take?

1262
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,904
There's no way she can beat me

1263
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,947
in votes.

1264
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:45,990
She followed and did everything

1265
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:46,991
I told her to do.

1266
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:47,992
She wouldn't even know how to

1267
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:48,993
talk.

1268
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:49,994
She might even say, "Oh, he's

1269
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:50,995
right.

1270
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:51,996
Give it all to him."

1271
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:52,621
You know, she's so sweet, I love

1272
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:57,168
it.

1273
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,586
>> PROBST: With Kelly voted out,

1274
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,756
the original Galu members were

1275
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,506
grasping at anything to stop

1276
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,133
their freefall.

1277
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,509
>> I just wish there was a way

1278
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,553
that Kelly were here so we could

1279
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:07,970
keep Galu together.

1280
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:08,512
>> Well, it's not reality.

1281
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,556
>> I know. I know, I know.

1282
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,599
>> That's not where we find

1283
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,600
ourselves.

1284
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,809
>> The game freaking changes.

1285
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,144
>> Well, the game changes every

1286
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,228
day, but...

1287
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,229
>> Yeah.

1288
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,230
>> Sit down, Mon.

1289
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:18,773
>> I feel like from my best

1290
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,565
position right now, the best

1291
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,109
thing is to just wait it out and

1292
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,110
stick with Galu.

1293
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,153
You know what I'm saying?

1294
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,405
>> Is there a Galu since Erik

1295
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,615
got blindsided, to you,

1296
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,617
personally, in the real freaking

1297
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,618
world to be true?

1298
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,203
>> I just don't know that I can

1299
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,245
trust anybody from Foa Foa...

1300
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,246
>> Listen to me.

1301
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,247
>> Uh-huh.

1302
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,707
>> Don't lower your brows like I

1303
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,000
just attacked you.

1304
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,835
Drop the bull about Galu

1305
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,464
loyalty, 'cause there is none.

1306
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,424
It's Puff the Magic Freaking

1307
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,425
Dragon, okay?

1308
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,426
>> But why, Shambo?

1309
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,427
>> That's a pipe dream.

1310
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,428
>> Why?

1311
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,222
Why does it have to be that way?

1312
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,264
>> Because you guys chose to

1313
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:52,848
vote for Galu before Foa Foa,

1314
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,516
and it broke.

1315
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,517
>> But it was different.

1316
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,518
>> It's...

1317
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,560
>> He was turning his back...

1318
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,561
>> It always is.

1319
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,562
>> ...on Galu.

1320
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,439
>> It always is because it's

1321
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,440
<i>Survivor,</i> yes?

1322
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,441
>> That was different, though.

1323
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,734
>> It doesn't matter who it was

1324
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,735
or why it was.

1325
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,694
>> Right.

1326
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,780
>> Purple is broken.

1327
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,073
Erik helped us win every single

1328
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,116
solitary challenge that we won.

1329
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,117
He was...

1330
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,118
>> Because it helped himself.

1331
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,119
He was fake purple.

1332
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,703
>> Then Kelly's fake purple for

1333
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,163
having a knife in my back.

1334
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,040
And why was there conversations

1335
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,501
had, lead by Laura, to get rid

1336
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,502
of Shambo?

1337
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,503
That's fake purple.

1338
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,088
So don't talk to me about fake

1339
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,089
purple.

1340
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,090
Purple is fake.

1341
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:26,674
There is no fake, there is no

1342
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,675
real.

1343
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,634
It's<i> Survivor.</i>

1344
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,635
>> Yeah.

1345
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,304
(thunder rumbling)

1346
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,597
>> PROBST: That night in Tribal

1347
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,349
Council, the remaining Foa Foa

1348
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,601
tribe and Shambo declared

1349
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,769
victory.

1350
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,271
Ninth person voted out and the

1351
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,314
third member of our jury, Laura.

1352
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,068
>> Oh, my gosh.

1353
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,195
The day of reckoning has come.

1354
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,573
Laura is gone.

1355
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,615
Now, it's an individual game.

1356
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,992
And I'm not sure what's going

1357
00:40:53,075 --> 00:41:03,919
to happen.

1358
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:04,920
>> PROBST: Nine castaways are

1359
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:05,921
left.

1360
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:06,589
>> I'm here to win the million

1361
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,590
dollars for myself.

1362
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,632
>> PROBST: As the stakes get

1363
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,633
higher...

1364
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,927
I hope you think it was worth

1365
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:12,928
it.

1366
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:13,929
>> ALL: Oh!

1367
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:14,930
>> PROBST: ...which alliances

1368
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:15,931
will hold true?

1369
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:16,974
>> Russell is Russell, so we got

1370
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:17,933
to watch out.

1371
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:18,934
>> Why would you do something

1372
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:19,935
stupid like that?

1373
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:20,936
>> I did not... I didn't do

1374
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,937
that!

1375
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:22,771
>> PROBST: What sacrifices will

1376
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:23,606
the castaways be forced to make?

1377
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,231
>> If this goes bad, I mean, I

1378
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:24,648
owe you big time.

1379
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,649
>> PROBST: Can old Galu reunite

1380
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,650
its force?

1381
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,444
>> The writing's on the wall.

1382
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,236
>> PROBST: And can anyone stop

1383
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,237
Russell?

1384
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,030
>> I'm going to write a book on

1385
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,531
how to win<i> Survivor.</i>

1386
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,074
>> PROBST: Join us next week as

1387
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,161
the adventure continues.

1388
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,920

make a move.

1393
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,138
>> PROBST: So everybody needs an

1394
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,139
edge.

1395
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,307
This is a significant advantage

1396
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,350
in the next immunity challenge.

1397
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,351
And Shambo thinks she has a

1398
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,352
psychic vision.

1399
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,311
>> I dreamed some really crazy

1400
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,395
things.

1401
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,396
I think that's God's divine

1402
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,397
intervention at work.

1403
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,398
I had a dream last night we

1404
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,235
